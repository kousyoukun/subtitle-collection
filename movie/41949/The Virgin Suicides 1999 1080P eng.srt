1
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:22,110
Cecilia was the first to go.

2
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,618
What are you doing here, honey?

3
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:11,039
You're not even old enough
to know how bad life gets.

4
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:14,918
Obviously, Doctor,
you've never been a 13-year-old girl.

5
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:53,043
Everyone dates
the demise of our neighbourhood…

6
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,755
…from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.

7
00:02:56,757 --> 00:03:01,010
People saw their clairvoyance in
the wiped-out elms, the harsh sunlight…

8
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:04,431
…and the continuing decline
of our auto industry.

9
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,852
Even then, as teenagers,
we tried to put the pieces together.

10
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:11,479
We still can't.

11
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:14,859
Now whenever we run into each other
at lunches or parties…

12
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:18,196
…we find ourselves going over
the evidence one more time.

13
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:21,491
All to understand those five girls…

14
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:25,371
…who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.

15
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,085
Cecilia, the youngest, was 13.

16
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,923
And Lux was 14.

17
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,595
Bonnie was 15.

18
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,181
Mary was 16.

19
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,311
And Therese was 17.

20
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:55,403
No one could understand how Mrs Lisbon
and Mr Lisbon, our math teacher…

21
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,280
…had produced such beautiful creatures.

22
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:04,788
Paul Baldino claimed to have
found Cecilia on her first attempt.

23
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,040
Hey, I was the one who found her.

24
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,545
I was in the storm sewer under my house.
There's all these tunnels.

25
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,715
You could get into anyone's house.

26
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,883
When Paul said this, we believed him…

27
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:19,095
…because he was the son
of Sammy "the Shark" Baldino…

28
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,597
…and we knew about his escape tunnel.

29
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:25,477
So I went up, thinking I could see
one of those girls taking a shower!

30
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,020
Right!

31
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:28,897
And I walk in…

32
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,774
…and I see blood everywhere.

33
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:35,196
So I turned around, went for the stairs
and right back out the tunnel.

34
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,949
I had to tell you guys that story.

35
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,660
I'll see you guys later, all right?

36
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:47,586
- I heard there was an accident.
- It was no accident, Joan.

37
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:49,962
Of course the parents are to blame!

38
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,881
I heard they found the
razor in the toilet…

39
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:56,677
Everyone had an opinion as to why
Cecilia had tried to kill herself.

40
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:00,890
That girl didn't want to die.
She just wanted out of that house.

41
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:03,685
She wanted out
of that decorating scheme.

42
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:11,320
The most popular theory
held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.

43
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:16,867
Dominic was staying with relatives
until his family got settled in New Mexico.

44
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,204
He was the first in our neighbourhood
to wear sunglasses…

45
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:23,123
…and within a week of his arrival
he'd fallen in love.

46
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,254
The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia,
but Diana Porter.

47
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:35,053
I love her!

48
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:39,474
When Diana Porter left on vacation
in Switzerland, Dominic denounced God.

49
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:43,186
To prove the validity of his love…

50
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,774
…he jumped off the roof
of his relatives' house.

51
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,843
Ahem! I'm gonna
show you some images…

52
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:15,430
…and, uh… you tell me…

53
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,601
…what they remind you of.

54
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:22,646
OK?

55
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,417
A banana.

56
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,133
A swamp.

57
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,896
An Afro.

58
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:21,668
I don't think Cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

59
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:25,255
Her act was a cry for help.

60
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,593
I know you're very strict…

61
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:33,598
…but I think that Cecilia would benefit
by having a social outlet…

62
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:36,561
…outside of the codification of school…

63
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:41,524
…where she could interact
with males her own age.

64
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:53,911
Peter Sisten had helped Mr Lisbon install
a model of the solar system in his class.

65
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:57,040
And in return Mr Lisbon
invited him for dinner.

66
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,544
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts…

67
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:03,631
…which we are about to receive from thy
bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

68
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,384
Amen.

69
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,178
Lux, please, put your
shirt on this instant.

70
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:10,347
Sorry.

71
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,854
- Thank you, dear.
- Can you pass the salt, please?

72
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:19,774
- Ham?
- Thank you.

73
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,902
- Sweetheart, would you like some peas?
- I hate peas.

74
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,237
Here.

75
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:27,532
That's a nice-looking ham, dear.

76
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,705
- Well, thank you, honey.
- Mm, this is good.

77
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:35,916
So, Peter, are you an aviation enthusiast?

78
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,131
Well, I don't know if I'd call myself
an enthusiast, but I like planes.

79
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:44,884
Ah.

80
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:48,680
Uh, Peter, are you on the football squad?

81
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:52,185
Um, no, I play it,
but I'm not actually on the team.

82
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:54,562
- Oh, I see.
- Ah, not a team player.

83
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:56,315
Do you like to wrestle?

84
00:08:57,648 --> 00:09:00,942
You OK, Peter?

85
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:05,865
The Brazilian turbot frog was added to
the endangered species list today.

86
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,993
- That's the third animal this year.
- Oh, dear.

87
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:11,997
The turbot frog?
I don't think I've ever heard of…

88
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:14,375
Um, excuse me, may I use the rest room?

89
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,587
Oh, of course. The one down here
isn't working very well.

90
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,006
- Go upstairs through Cecilia's room.
- OK. Thanks.

91
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:31,293
Hold… Hold on.

92
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,838
I thought you'd died in there.

93
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:39,551
Are you done hogging the bathroom?
I need something.

94
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:48,895
Do you mind?

95
00:10:56,988 --> 00:11:00,449
- Thank you very much.
- You forgetting something?

96
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:06,748
Oh, Peter. Here's a little aerofoil
I thought you might find amusing.

97
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,749
It's a…

98
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,337
…demonstration of
Bernoulli's principle: lift.

99
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,552
From that time on,
the Lisbon house began to change.

100
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,433
Almost every day…

101
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,520
…and even when
she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia…

102
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,107
…Lux would suntan wearing a swimsuit…

103
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:35,570
…that caused the knife sharpener to give
her a 15-minute demonstration for free.

104
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,662
Following the doctor's orders,
two weeks after Cecilia returned home…

105
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:47,750
…Mr Lisbon persuaded his wife to allow the
girls to throw the first and only party…

106
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,711
…of their short lives.

107
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,764
There. Is that OK?

108
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,687
I' m gonna get dressed.

109
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:16,157
- Welcome!
- Good evening, Mrs Lisbon.

110
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,326
Come on in.

111
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:23,164
The party's in the basement.

112
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:29,963
Just go on round to the left,
and then down the stairs.

113
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,562
Hi, I'm Bonaventure.

114
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:45,646
Hi.

115
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,817
- Hi. Tim.
- Nice to meet you.

116
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:50,987
Hi.

117
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:55,867
- Would you like some punch?
- Yeah.

118
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,120
Thanks.

119
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:00,288
- Hi.
- Hi.

120
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,832
Thanks.

121
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,627
- Hi.
- Thank you.

122
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:10,216
- Hey.
- Hi.

123
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,176
Do you wanna sit down?

124
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,553
- Yeah.
- Me too.

125
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:58,059
Um, how did your SATs go?

126
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:00,603
OK.

127
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,564
Good.

128
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,693
Do you know where you're applying yet?

129
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:09,779
Well, no, but my parents
are pushing towards Yale…

130
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,949
…cos that's where my dad went.

131
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,453
That's nice.

132
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,459
You have to imagine
what it'd be like when…

133
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:24,629
…out of the sun would come the Hun
and his Messerschmitt coming down.

134
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:27,592
And boys, I swear,
two or three years older than you…

135
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:31,554
…would be in this - the P51B Mustang.
B for what? For bull's-eye, see?

136
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:35,892
You've heard of Yale?

137
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,060
Oh, yeah.

138
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,065
This punch is fantastic.

139
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,859
- Can I give you more?
- Sure. What's in it?

140
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:48,072
Juices. Some cherry, pineapple.

141
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,286
You know, I uh… I love pineapple.

142
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,705
Really?

143
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:09,845
This baby would come in, and this won
the war for the United Kingdom. You see?

144
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:12,891
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

145
00:15:13,558 --> 00:15:18,188
And it's this kind of, uh…
this kind of equipment that makes, uh…

146
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,565
…a model work.

147
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,238
Here's Joe.

148
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,948
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

149
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:34,957
- Now, if he needs anything just call me.
- Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine.

150
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,292
Hi.

151
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,254
Hi.

152
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:43,757
- Joe! Good to see you. How are ya?
- Hey, Joe.

153
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,678
- Glad you came tonight.
- How's it going?

154
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:48,638
You're just in time.

155
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,640
Good. Hi.

156
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:53,642
Everyone look! His ears wiggle
if you scratch his chin.

157
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,356
Joe, sing your song.

158
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,734

Good job, Joe!

162
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:15,667
Good job, Joe.

163
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:20,465
Where'd you learn that song?

164
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,968
May I be excused?

165
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:28,098
If you want to, dear,
but this is your party.

166
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:35,146
Oh, all right, if you want to go upstairs,
go ahead, but we'll just…

167
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,858
We'll just have to have fun without you.

168
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,279
Oh, look. He always chooses heads.

169
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:43,448
- Joe, what's it gonna be?
- Heads.

170
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:45,909
Joe, will you try tails?

171
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:48,995
Heads it is!

172
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,373
I'll show you again. Let's go.

173
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:53,125
- Heads.
- Tails.

174
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,460
Heads.

175
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:57,254
- One more time. In the air, Joe.
- Heads.

176
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:03,385
Heads it is anyway. One more time here.

177
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:05,764
- OK, call in the air, Joe.
- Heads.

178
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,309
Heads. Not bad.

179
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,437
How you doin'?

180
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:15,399
Good.

181
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,445
- You picked it up really well.
- It's my favourite song.

182
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,616
You know, you're… very beautiful.

183
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,537
I could paint you sometime.

184
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,873
Thanks.

185
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,880
- So did they sing it to you?
- Yeah.

186
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,886
Cecilia!

187
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,893
Cecilia!

188
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:06,538
Oh, my God…

189
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,708
No! No! No! Don't look. Turn around.

190
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:14,004
Turn around. Darlings, turn around.

191
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:16,966
Don't look. Don't… Don't look at this.

192
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:20,178
Oh, Jesus. Please, God.

193
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,645
OK.

194
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:58,034
- What did he say?
- He said she was only 13.

195
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,553
Oh, hi, Mary. Are your parents home?

196
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:16,722
Hi, Father Moody. Come in.

197
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:26,399
Oh, hello, Father.

198
00:20:27,984 --> 00:20:30,069
Please, sit down.

199
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:32,822
Thanks.

200
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:35,074
Come on, Miller, that was inside.

201
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:39,079
Ah, no. No, thanks.

202
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:51,843
How about we get the missus down here,
have a little chat?

203
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:54,013
Afraid she's under the weather.

204
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:56,932
She's not really…

205
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,519
…seeing anybody.

206
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,773
Well, she'll see her priest.

207
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:08,569
Ah! This kid's a sucker
for the high inside ones every time.

208
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:10,739
Every time.

209
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,407
Excuse me.

210
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:18,288
Father.

211
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:26,589
Ah! Double play… Father.

212
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,635
Double play.

213
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:54,871
Mrs Lisbon?

214
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,884
- May I come in?
- OK.

215
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:12,723
Hello, girls.

216
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,434
I thought we could talk.

217
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:18,438
Do you feel like talking?

218
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:24,027
Well, if you ever want to,
you know where to find me.

219
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:35,998
Mrs Lisbon, it's Father Moody.

220
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:44,424
Mrs Lisbon, hello.

221
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:53,602
I wanted you to know that
I listed Cecilia's death as an accident.

222
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:11,995
An accident waiting to happen. John said
you couldn't get a policy to cover it.

223
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,290
I know. It's so incredibly dangerous.

224
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,459
Let's give it a try.

225
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:21,131
Ready?

226
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:23,133
One, two, three.

227
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:30,599
Oh, God. It's just so sad.
I can't even believe it.

228
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,768
Footings are too deep.

229
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,272
Got that chain in your truck?

230
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,878
Hit it!

231
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:15,940
Our collection of souvenirs
of the Lisbon girls, which still exists…

232
00:24:16,024 --> 00:24:18,359
…started with Cecilia's diary.

233
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:21,988
Parkie had gotten it from Skip Ortega,
the plumber's assistant…

234
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:24,407
…who had found it next to the toilet.

235
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:27,119
Tim Weiner - "the Brain" - decoded it.

236
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:29,330
Emotional instability.

237
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:32,751
Look at the I's.
The dots on'em, they're everywhere.

238
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,379
Basically…

239
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:38,590
…what we have here is a dreamer.

240
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:41,134
Someone completely
out of touch with reality.

241
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:44,639
When she jumped,
she probably thought she would fly.

242
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:50,728
"Monday, February 13th.
Today we had frozen pizza."

243
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:59,238
"Thursday. Mom made creamed corn for
dinner. It's the worst. It looks like…"

244
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:04,828
"Mary chipped her front tooth
on the monkey bars."

245
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,706
"She made a big scene and had to
get it capped. It looks normal, I guess."

246
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,875
Here, give me that.

247
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:13,836
Told you she had a capped tooth.

248
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:22,888
Elm trees. How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

249
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,726
Here, something about Dominic.

250
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:32,023
"Palazzolo jumped off the roof
over that rich bitch Porter."

251
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:34,484
"How stupid can you be?"

252
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:39,240
"Today we went out on the boat.
It was cold."

253
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:41,450
"We saw a couple of whales."

254
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:45,037
"Lux stroked the whale.
I didn't think they'd stink so much."

255
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:47,874
"It's the kelp in their baleens rotting."

256
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:50,294
"I hope we can go again sometime."

257
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:54,006
Let's read that. "Lux
lost it over Kevin…"

258
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,966
- Is it Heines?
- "Heines, the garbage man."

259
00:25:57,051 --> 00:26:00,305
Lux lost it over Kevin Haines,
the garbage man.

260
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:04,350
She'd wake up at five in the morning
and hang out on the front steps -

261
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:06,518
…like it wasn't completely obvious.

262
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:09,647
She wrote his name in marker
on all her underwear.

263
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:12,235
Mom found them
and bleached out the Kevins.

264
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:14,612
Lux was crying on her bed all day.

265
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:25,957
The trees like lungs filling with air.

266
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,045
My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair.

267
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:39,263
And so we started
to learn about their lives…

268
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:43,518
…coming to hold collective memories
of times we hadn't experienced.

269
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:49,191
We felt the imprisonment of being a girl,
the way it made your mind dreamy…

270
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,943
…so you ended up knowing
what colours went together.

271
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,113
We knew the girls
were really women in disguise…

272
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,117
…that they understood love
and even death…

273
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:04,041
…and that our job was merely to create
the noise that seemed to fascinate them.

274
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,294
We knew that they knew
everything about us.

275
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:09,964
And that we couldn't fathom them at all.

276
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:26,355
Hi. Uh, Mrs Lisbon, I'm Lydia Perl.

277
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,732
I'm putting together a… Oh.

278
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:33,322
- Hi, I'm Bonnie. This is Mary.
- Hello, girls.

279
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:38,619
Um, I'm here to ask you
a couple of questions about Cecilia.

280
00:27:40,455 --> 00:27:41,915
Yeah?

281
00:27:42,332 --> 00:27:48,089
Great, great. Um, maybe you could start
by telling me a little bit about her.

282
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:52,761
Did she have any
special interests or hobbies?

283
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:57,348
- Um, she liked writing in her journal a lot.
- That is great.

284
00:27:58,016 --> 00:28:01,186
Um, OK. Uh, did she…

285
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:03,982
Did she ever talk about ending her life?

286
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,567
What's going on here?

287
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,529
Um, you must be Mrs Lisbon.

288
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:12,031
I'm Lydia Perl. I'm from Channel 2, and…

289
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:14,201
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

290
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,705
The suicide of an East Side teenager
last summer…

291
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:21,999
…has increased the awareness
of a national crisis.

292
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,921
I'm in front of the home
where Cecilia Lisbon…

293
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,131
Why can't they let her rest in peace?

294
00:28:27,215 --> 00:28:30,926
…and write poetry,
tragically put an end to her life.

295
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,847
Psychologists agree that adolescence
today is much more fraught…

296
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,185
…by pressures and complexities
than in years past.

297
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:42,481
More and more doctors say this
frustration can lead to acts of violence…

298
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:47,403
…whose reality the adolescent cannot
separate from its intended drama.

299
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:51,490
I baked a pie full of rat poison.

300
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:56,411
I thought I could eat it, you know,
without being suspicious.

301
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:01,168
My nana, who is 86…

302
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:07,091
She really liked sweets.

303
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,346
She had three pieces.

304
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:19,603
I feel sorriest for the mother.

305
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:23,484
You'd always wonder if
there was something you could've done.

306
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:26,654
- I gotta go. See you later.
- All right, then. Bye-bye.

307
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:28,824
Bye-bye.

308
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:32,309
Don't worry.

309
00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:35,229
They took the fence out.

310
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,295
God, you snore loud.

311
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,348
Those girls have a bright future
ahead of them.

312
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:50,060
The other one
was just gonna end up a kook.

313
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:55,148
We didn't see the girls together as
a group until convocation, September 7th.

314
00:31:55,232 --> 00:32:01,614
Mary, Lux, Bonnie and Therese came to
school as though nothing had happened.

315
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,783
We felt if we looked hard enough…

316
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:07,746
…we might begin to understand what
they were feeling and who they were.

317
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:12,293
All right, so if we have - these are
Venn diagrams, as you remember…

318
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:16,130
If we have A and B intersecting…

319
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:18,299
…and A and B…

320
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:21,428
If A intersects B, we have this area.

321
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:27,142
And if A is the union with B, we have
all of the circle, plus the intersection.

322
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:33,274
These are the laws of
intersection and union. OK?

323
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:46,372
How's it going?

324
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,625
Not bad.

325
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:57,551
"Do a character sketch on the following
characters from Portrait Of A Lady."

326
00:32:57,634 --> 00:33:00,554
The first one is… Ralph.

327
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:03,723
Um, he was nice.

328
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,102
It was really sad when he died.

329
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,649
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I just said that.

330
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:13,818
I am so sorry.

331
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:29,169
Reading about
the alarming suicide rate…

332
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:32,588
…I talked to Mr Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here…

333
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:36,383
…and realised that nothing
about this serious matter…

334
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:39,180
…has been discussed at this school.

335
00:33:39,263 --> 00:33:42,433
Quickly thereafter
green pamphlets were distributed.

336
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:46,353
We thought green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.

337
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:48,522
Certainly better than red.

338
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:51,693
They told us there were
80 suicides a day in America…

339
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:55,405
- …30,000 a year…
- Cheese!

340
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:58,949
…and alerted us to danger signals
we couldn't help but look for.

341
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,787
Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?

342
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:06,376
Had they lost interest in school
activities, in sports and hobbies?

343
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:08,878
Had they withdrawn from their peers?

344
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,799
Hi. I'm Chase.

345
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,012
I know who you are.

346
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:21,183
I've only been going to this school
my whole life.

347
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:24,394
You don't have to talk to me.

348
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,993
For example, we have
two different types of economics -

349
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:43,082
…or so-called two different types.
The first one is called macroeconomics.

350
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,878
Look. She's laughing.

351
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:53,718
He made her laugh! I've never heard him
say anything remotely intelligent.

352
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:58,432
The boys who talked with Lux
were always the stupidest…

353
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:01,102
…and made terrible
sources of information.

354
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,520
Squeezebox is all right.

355
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:07,191
Let me tell you, she's the hottest girl
in the school for sure.

356
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:11,155
Do you wanna know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

357
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:13,949
Nah, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

358
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:17,245
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what I mean.

359
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:22,208
But the only reliable boy
who actually got to know Lux…

360
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:26,921
…was Trip Fontaine, who only
eight months before the suicides…

361
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:30,926
…had emerged from baby fat
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

362
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,596
I'm late again.

363
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,727
Oh, come on.

364
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,697
Thank you.

All the girls at our school
were in love with Trip.

382
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:07,531
All the girls except for Lux.

383
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:10,994
Trip told us his passion for Lux started…

384
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:15,122
…when he went into the wrong
history class during fifth period.

385
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:18,626
He went out to his car
to smoke the marijuana he took…

386
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,299
…as regularly as Peter Petrovich,
the diabetic kid, took his insulin.

387
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:31,308
On this particular day
he ran into Mr Woodhouse…

388
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,810
…and ducked into the nearest class.

389
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:51,537
She was the still point
of the turning world, man.

390
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,210
I never got over that girl. Never.

391
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,049
I mean… you know,
I loved a lot of ladies, but not like that.

392
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:04,218
That was real.

393
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:09,098
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.
I didn't know what had hit me.

394
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:11,683
I didn't know what to do…

395
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:15,563
…cos it was so easy
with all the other girls…

396
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:17,734
…but she wouldn't look at me.

397
00:38:18,149 --> 00:38:20,028
I, uh…

398
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,656
I was never the kind to pursue,
if you know what I mean.

399
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,829
That girl drove me crazy, man.

400
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:46,722
Mm, yummy. Warm.

401
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,432
Lux.

402
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:51,395
Hey.

403
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:59,444
- Look at it. It's just meat on bread.
- Eugh! Sick!

404
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:02,615
Thanks, Mom.

405
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,333
Trip's dad was little help.

406
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:19,925
Well, first off, don't
call her on the phone.

407
00:39:20,718 --> 00:39:23,387
It's all, um… it's all subtlety.

408
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,347
It's all nuance.

409
00:39:25,433 --> 00:39:28,560
Yeah. You just need
to talk to her at school, you know…

410
00:39:28,644 --> 00:39:32,772
…about anything. About the weather,
or school assignments.

411
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:36,359
Um, you know, anything
to have the chance to communicate…

412
00:39:36,444 --> 00:39:39,322
…with the language of eye contact.

413
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:41,948
And, uh, project confidence.

414
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:45,912
And keep the hair out of your eyes.

415
00:39:47,538 --> 00:39:49,625
She'll feel the vibe.

416
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:58,717
- Just be yourself.
- Yeah.

417
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:04,600
The word hurricane was the name…

418
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:07,643
…given to nature's strongest storm.

419
00:40:07,728 --> 00:40:11,523
A hurricane occurs when high pressure
and low pressure masses of air…

420
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:13,943
…come in contact with one another.

421
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:20,493
There is often a significant difference
in temperature between the two masses.

422
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:23,912
One mass is warm,
while the other is cold.

423
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,209
The warmer air rises
and the cooler air falls.

424
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:36,092
Likewise, the low pressure slides down
the sides of the high-pressure area.

425
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:41,097
They swirl in and around one another,
creating the beginnings of the storm.

426
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:47,229
In this footage, taken from
US Navy weather patrol aircraft…

427
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,773
…we can clearly observe
the two masses…

428
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:54,863
…one high pressure and one low,
coming in contact with one another.

429
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,244
The result is a surging storm
of tremendous strength…

430
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:04,372
…that strikes with
forceful determination.

431
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:14,800
Even though the hurricane is
the most powerful storm known to us…

432
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:23,350
Must have been Conley.

433
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:26,271
His ass is grass.

434
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:33,905
I'm gonna ask you out.

435
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:38,117
Fat chance.

436
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:45,959
First I'm gonna come over to your house
on Sunday and watch the tube.

437
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:48,254
Then I'm gonna ask you out.

438
00:41:57,055 --> 00:41:59,139
You're a stone fox.

439
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:04,729
The hurricane: one of the most truly
awe-inspiring and spectacular storms…

440
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,899
…nature has to offer.

441
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:16,534
- What channel's this?
- Five.

442
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:21,082
Ah, let's see. Um, Animals In The Wild.

443
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,959
"Journey through the African Kalahari…

444
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:27,046
…as we visit exotic animals
in their natural habitat."

445
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,632
I think that sounds very nice, don't you?

446
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,847
The rainforest eventually
gives way to expansive arid grasslands…

447
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:39,394
…that stretch to the horizon
in all directions.

448
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,270
This is the Kalahari.

449
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:44,856
Uh, do you want some more pop?

450
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:48,068
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

451
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:55,451
Thanks.

452
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:03,545
The wildlife spectacle played out
on these vast open grasslands…

453
00:43:03,627 --> 00:43:08,217
…and in the deep recesses of
the rainforest is unparalleled on Earth.

454
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:19,978
Lux, please put your feet down, honey.

455
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:28,863
The Kalahari and its vast open skies
provide the theatre…

456
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:35,870
…for the drama played out by the herds
and the great cats that prey on them.

457
00:43:37,623 --> 00:43:39,707
Oh, my!

458
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,795
It's getting so late. Honey?

459
00:43:46,425 --> 00:43:48,509
- I said it's getting late.
- Yeah? Oh.

460
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,721
Well, Skip, we usually
hit the hay about now, so…

461
00:43:53,724 --> 00:43:55,601
Right.

462
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:01,941
- OK.
- Thank you.

463
00:44:02,024 --> 00:44:03,275
OK, so…

464
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,987
- It's nice to meet you, Mrs Lisbon.
- Yes.

465
00:44:06,988 --> 00:44:09,074
- Good night.
- See you.

00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:49,516
Gotta get back before bed check.

472
00:45:57,442 --> 00:46:01,446
♪ But I tell myself
that I was doin' all right

473
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:04,199
♪ There's nothin' left to do at night

474
00:46:04,824 --> 00:46:07,453
♪ But go crazy on you

475
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:12,792
Ahem.

476
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:18,924
Uh, this is fourth period.
I don't have you until fifth.

477
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:20,467
- I know.
- Oh.

478
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,845
I'm not here for math today, sir.

479
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:30,311
I'm here to tell you that my intentions
for your daughter are honourable.

480
00:46:32,647 --> 00:46:34,775
What… might those intentions be?

481
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:38,236
I wanna ask Lux to
the Homecoming dance.

482
00:46:41,157 --> 00:46:43,784
Trip, why don't you sit down
for a minute?

483
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,708
You see, my wife and I have certain rules.

484
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:56,464
They've been the same for the older girls.
I can't change them for the younger ones.

485
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:59,425
Even if I wanted to,
the wife wouldn't let me.

486
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:02,095
True. So, uh…

487
00:47:02,638 --> 00:47:06,184
If you want to come over and
watch TV again, that would be fine…

488
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:10,313
…but you cannot take Lux out,
especially not in a car.

489
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:13,108
So I'm sorry, son, that's just our policy.

490
00:47:16,361 --> 00:47:20,073
OK, sir, what if there was
a bunch of us guys…

491
00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:22,868
…and we took
all your daughters out in a group…

492
00:47:22,952 --> 00:47:25,705
…and we had'em back
by whatever time you said?

493
00:47:25,787 --> 00:47:29,292
- Are you on the football squad, son?
- Yes, sir.

494
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:32,379
- Ah. What position?
- Defensive cornerback.

495
00:47:32,462 --> 00:47:34,923
Ah. Good. Good.

496
00:47:35,006 --> 00:47:38,052
I was a…
I was a safety in my day.

497
00:47:38,136 --> 00:47:41,973
That's a crucial position, sir.
Nothing between you and the goal line.

498
00:47:42,056 --> 00:47:44,392
Exactly! Exactly.

499
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:45,935
Oh, well…

500
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:49,856
So the thing is, sir, we've got
the big game against Country Day…

501
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:54,861
…then afterwards we have the dance and…
all the other guys are taking dates.

502
00:47:54,945 --> 00:47:59,200
You're a good-looking fellow, Trip.
Lots of girls would go with you, I bet.

503
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:03,828
Yeah, well, I'm not interested
in lots of girls, sir.

504
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:13,340
I'll take it up with the wife, Trip.
Do what I can.

505
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,219
Thank you, sir.

506
00:48:18,887 --> 00:48:20,974
- It's a graph.
- Oh.

507
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,228
Mm.

508
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:32,652
Trip Fontaine and some of the…

509
00:48:33,655 --> 00:48:38,576
…other boys in the football squad asked
to take the girls to the Homecoming dance.

510
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:41,369
You know how I feel
about that sort of thing.

511
00:48:41,453 --> 00:48:45,668
- I'm gonna be a chaperon at the dance.
- Oh, come on, Mom. Please!

512
00:48:46,668 --> 00:48:49,212
Your father and I will discuss it later.

513
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:54,927
Mr Fontaine,
may I speak with you, please?

514
00:48:55,885 --> 00:48:58,556
Now, my wife and I have
had a little talk…

515
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:01,892
…and we've come to a decision
about your request.

516
00:49:14,823 --> 00:49:16,492
Yes!

517
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:23,875
I'm taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

518
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:27,085
I need three guys to take the other girls.

519
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:35,845
I'll give you three joints, Trip.

520
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,309
Come on, Trip, man. You pick me,
we can take my dad's Caddy.

521
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:41,479
You gotta pick me, Tripster!

522
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,272
Trip, man, you owe me.

523
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,194
I saved your ass
with Woodhouse that time.

524
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,029
- Thanks, Dad!
- OK.

525
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,782
- Who are the other boys?
- Ah, let's see.

526
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,202
Parker Denton and Jake Conley.
He's a very good student, dear.

527
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,996
And, uh… Kevin Head.

528
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,291
- Who's taking who?
- Whom.

529
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,460
They're just gonna raffle us off.

530
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:10,049
It made no difference which pattern
of their dream dresses the girls chose.

531
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:14,514
Mrs Lisbon added an inch to the
bust line and two to the waist and hems.

532
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:18,226
And the dresses came out
as four identical sacks.

533
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:20,687
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah.

534
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,357
OK. Come on.

535
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:30,990
Oh, I'm sorry. OK, there we go.
OK, come on, together.

536
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:33,993
- There's a leak.
- And Cheddar cheese!

537
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:40,543
I'm so excited!

538
00:51:01,148 --> 00:51:03,233
- You ready?
- Let's go.

539
00:51:03,317 --> 00:51:06,028
- Ready, man.
- Let's do it.

540
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:14,412
In the end Parkie won
because of the Cadillac…

541
00:51:14,495 --> 00:51:17,123
…Kevin Head because
he had the killer weed…

542
00:51:17,206 --> 00:51:20,085
…and Joe Hill Conley
because he won school prizes -

543
00:51:20,169 --> 00:51:23,673
…which Trip thought
would impress Mr and Mrs Lisbon.

544
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:28,010
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Mrs Lisbon.

545
00:51:28,677 --> 00:51:30,138
Come in.

546
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,306
Thank you.

547
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:47,615
- Uh, who… who… who's driving?
- I am.

548
00:51:47,698 --> 00:51:49,867
How long have you had your licence?

549
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,871
Two months, but I had
my learner's permit for a year.

550
00:51:52,955 --> 00:51:56,792
We almost never let the girls
go out in cars unless it's necessary.

551
00:51:56,874 --> 00:52:00,963
There's so many accidents nowadays.
I'm sure you will be very careful.

552
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:04,175
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- OK, third degree's over!

553
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:06,886
Girls!

554
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:13,100
- I better get going. See you at the dance.
- See you there, Mr Lisbon.

555
00:52:13,184 --> 00:52:15,271
Bye, dear.

556
00:52:15,522 --> 00:52:17,606
See you later.

557
00:52:21,859 --> 00:52:23,946
Girls, come on down.

558
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:26,950
The boys are here.

559
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:53,603
We got white ones.

560
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:58,358
We didn't know what you were wearing,
and the guy, the flower guy, said…

561
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:00,944
…that white would go with anything, so…

562
00:53:01,904 --> 00:53:03,990
I'm glad you got white.

563
00:53:05,784 --> 00:53:08,286
Why don't you pin them on?

564
00:53:21,216 --> 00:53:23,302
Don't stick me!

565
00:53:35,775 --> 00:53:38,277
There we go. All right. Let's do it.

566
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:42,448
Bye, Mom.

567
00:53:42,573 --> 00:53:43,824
Bye.

568
00:53:52,877 --> 00:53:55,921
Oh my gosh, look, you guys.
Her car's there late again.

569
00:53:56,005 --> 00:53:58,257
Mr Leo's having an affair with the maid.

570
00:53:58,341 --> 00:54:00,801
I saw him follow her
into the laundry room.

571
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:04,806
- Eugh! He's so fat, and that red nose.
- Totally an alcoholic.

572
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:07,434
What about the Hessens?
You know they're Nazis.

573
00:54:07,518 --> 00:54:09,520
They're Nazi sympathisers, Bonnie.

574
00:54:09,602 --> 00:54:14,108
They had a fit when the Schwartzmans
tried to join the tennis club.

575
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,530
Nice aluminum siding
Do they really think that looks OK?

576
00:54:19,072 --> 00:54:21,909
Mr Kriegers ordered that
from TV late at night.

577
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:27,122
- It's the Baldinos' barbecue tree stump.
- I have never seen them barbecue on it.

578
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:30,251
Actually it's an escape tunnel
for Sammy "the Shark".

579
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:34,588
- Leads to a river where he has his boat.
- Yeah. Paul goes there all the time.

580
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:37,883
He can get into anyone's basement
through the storm sewers.

581
00:54:37,967 --> 00:54:40,053
- No way.
- Yeah.

582
00:54:40,428 --> 00:54:42,306
Cool.

583
00:54:55,153 --> 00:54:58,280
- Dad'll smell it on you.
- No, I got mints.

584
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,659
He'll smell it on your clothes.

585
00:55:01,743 --> 00:55:05,498
I'll just tell him some kids
were smoking in the bathroom.

586
00:55:06,915 --> 00:55:08,792
Don't let it die a virgin.

587
00:55:08,877 --> 00:55:11,754
- That's gross!
- Yeah, grow up, Conley.

626
00:58:01,606 --> 00:58:03,692
I don't want any, thanks.

627
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:07,195
Come on, just a taste. A tiny taste.

628
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:09,990
Don't be such a goody-goody.

629
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:17,081
Don't swallow it!

630
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:30,137
♪ I'd like to see you

631

637
00:59:13,184 --> 00:59:17,646
I'd like you all to put your hands together
for this year's king and queen:

638
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:20,192
…Trip Fontaine and Lux Lisbon.

639
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:50,015

I' m having the best time!

654
01:01:07,016 --> 01:01:09,185
Let's go for a walk.

655
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:12,230
We better not.
We've gotta go back in a minute.

656
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:17,194
We can keep an eye on the car.
They won't leave without us.

657
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:21,156
My dad.

658
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:24,827
Just tell him you had to put
the crown in your locker.

659
01:01:26,828 --> 01:01:29,122
- Hey, see that divot there?
- Uh-huh.

660
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:33,086
That's where I reamed this guy today
in a cross-body block.

661
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:35,714
Really?

662
01:01:37,383 --> 01:01:40,928
- Maybe they went with your dad.
- I doubt it.

663
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:45,558
- We're cooked.
- Luxie is. We're not.

664
01:02:04,202 --> 01:02:06,288
Does anyone have any mints?

665
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,875
- Sorry.
- No.

666
01:02:13,672 --> 01:02:15,757
Bye, Parkie.

667
01:02:17,884 --> 01:02:21,223
- We'll walk you to the door.
- No, don't.

668
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:23,766
Why not?

669
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,892
Just don't.

670
01:02:28,187 --> 01:02:29,439
OK.

671
01:02:30,524 --> 01:02:32,776
Will you call me?

672
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,945
Uh, absolutely.

673
01:02:40,325 --> 01:02:42,329
- Bye.
- Bye.

674
01:02:42,412 --> 01:02:44,289
Bye.

675
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,505
Where have you been?

676
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:30,845
Get in!

677
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:42,191
I walked home alone that night.

678
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:45,069
I didn't care how she got home.
It was weird.

679
01:05:45,653 --> 01:05:49,865
I mean, I liked her, I liked her a lot,
but out there on the field…

680
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,205
It was just different then.

681
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:00,460
That was the last time I saw her.

682
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:07,177
You know, most people
will never taste that kind of love.

683
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:10,096
But at least I tasted it once, right?

684
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:18,564
It's time for your
six o'clock group meeting.

685
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:37,877
Given Lux's failure to make curfew,
everyone expected a crackdown.

686
01:06:40,046 --> 01:06:42,839
But few anticipated it would be so drastic.

687
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,926
The girls were taken out of school…

688
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:50,140
…and Mrs Lisbon shut the house
in maximum security isolation.

689
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:55,270
She had done more than
just take the girls out of school.

690
01:06:55,354 --> 01:06:58,608
That Sunday,
arriving home from a church sermon…

691
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,694
…Mrs Lisbon commanded Lux
to destroy her rock records.

692
01:07:01,778 --> 01:07:03,654
Now!

693
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:05,823
But, Mom!

694
01:07:05,907 --> 01:07:08,201
This is final, Luxie.

695
01:07:08,283 --> 01:07:11,830
- It's not fair!
- I said now!

696
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,226
Now, Luxie!

697
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:46,284
Come on.

698
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:48,453
Hold on.

699
01:07:50,832 --> 01:07:54,711
Kiss! Please don't make me do this.

700
01:07:54,794 --> 01:07:56,879
Burn it.

701
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,270
Oh, Mom. Aerosmith!

702
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:14,065
- Come on. Don't make me burn this.
- No.

703
01:08:15,774 --> 01:08:17,861
What's that smell?

704
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:23,324
It's all right. That'll do for now.
Give me these. Give me these.

705
01:08:24,074 --> 01:08:26,161
I'll put them in the trash.

706
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:07,414
This was the time we began to see Lux
making love on the roof…

707
01:09:07,499 --> 01:09:09,375
…with random boys and men.

708
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,961
- Is she naked?
- You can't tell. Hold on.

709
01:09:12,045 --> 01:09:14,130
Well, get it focused.

710
01:09:14,964 --> 01:09:18,593
- Will you stop? Wait your turn.
- What are they doing?

711
01:09:19,218 --> 01:09:22,889
- They're rolling around up there.
- Let me see. Let me see.

712
01:09:22,973 --> 01:09:27,061
Hold on. And she's on him and
he's rubbing his hands through her hair.

713
01:09:27,144 --> 01:09:31,023
- Come on, let me look.
- No, it's my… It's my telescope, Chase!

714
01:09:31,106 --> 01:09:33,901
Yes, and what else?

715
01:09:33,984 --> 01:09:38,824
Our male up there
seems to be in a Burger Chalet uniform!

716
01:09:40,866 --> 01:09:45,163
That Burger Chalet - you never think
those guys ever get lucky.

717
01:09:45,456 --> 01:09:48,793
She turns to me and asks me
if I thought what we'd done was dirty.

718
01:09:48,876 --> 01:09:51,169
I knew what to say. I said no.

719
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:54,257
Then she grabs my hand
and goes "You like me, don't you?"

720
01:09:54,339 --> 01:09:58,178
I didn't say anything.
It's best to keep chicks guessing.

721
01:09:58,262 --> 01:10:02,475
Chase, honey!
Come practise your violin before dinner!

722
01:10:05,019 --> 01:10:09,190
You're not gonna believe it.
Lux is on the roof again tonight!

723
01:10:09,274 --> 01:10:12,444
- Her hands are moving down.
- I gotta see this!

724
01:10:13,069 --> 01:10:16,573
- This is beautiful.
- No, no. She's on top of him.

725
01:10:17,364 --> 01:10:19,452
- What's she doin', man?
- Wait.

726
01:10:20,829 --> 01:10:23,080
Now they're done, he's getting up.

727
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,877
- That's it?
- Popcorn.

728
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,419
That was quick.

729
01:10:43,436 --> 01:10:46,689
- Ooh, good morning!
- Good morning

730
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,650
Have we photosynthesised
breakfast today?

731
01:11:00,703 --> 01:11:02,790
Hello, Ronald.

732
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:05,085
Hi, Eric.

733
01:11:05,168 --> 01:11:08,630
Your daughters haven't been at school
for over two weeks.

734
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,926
You checked out back?

735
01:11:17,682 --> 01:11:20,185
They found a new math teacher.

736
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,189
- Well, he's gonna have to get another job.
- I know.

737
01:11:25,356 --> 01:11:29,111
How long can those girls
be cooped up like that?

738
01:11:49,467 --> 01:11:52,428
- Just go away. This is our tree.
- Girls!

739
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:56,098
Girls, it's a little late.
This tree is dead.

740
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:59,853
- Why not leave it up to nature?
- If we did, there'd be no trees left.

741
01:12:00,352 --> 01:12:02,647
That's what it's gonna be like anyway.

742
01:12:02,731 --> 01:12:06,276
If boats hadn't brought the fungus,
this wouldn't have happened.

743
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:08,654
OK? Let's go.

744
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:11,991
No?

745
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,326
All right. That's it.

746
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:18,664
I have an order to cut down your elm tree,
but your kids won't let us.

747
01:12:18,748 --> 01:12:23,462
- How do you know that tree's sick?
- It had yellow leaves. The tree is dead.

748
01:12:23,545 --> 01:12:26,840
Our daughter said Aritex is
a less aggressive therapy.

749
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:30,760
It doesn't work. I leave that tree,
they'll all be gone by next year.

750
01:12:30,844 --> 01:12:33,056
Will be anyway, way things are going!

751
01:12:33,139 --> 01:12:35,432
I don't want to call the police.

752
01:12:35,516 --> 01:12:40,563
Our daughters are standing on their own
front lawn. Since when is that a crime?

753
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:43,900
Right.

754
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:45,861
Uh…

755
01:12:55,664 --> 01:13:00,585
Clive, did you see those girls in the
nighties? That's the shot that I want, OK?

756
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,631
Honey, move forward.
I want those girls in the nighties.

757
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:07,218
Oh, God. OK.
Here, let's just back up a little bit.

758
01:13:09,553 --> 01:13:11,639
There you go. Is that good? OK?

759
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:16,519
Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon,
the East Side teenager…

760
01:13:16,603 --> 01:13:20,899
…whose suicide last summer focused
awareness on a national problem…

761
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:27,072
…put their own lives in jeopardy by trying
to protect the elm that Cecilia so loved.

762
01:14:19,379 --> 01:14:22,424
For the next few weeks
we hardly saw the girls at all.

763
01:14:24,802 --> 01:14:28,473
Joe Hill Conley didn't call Therese
as he had promised.

764
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,856
And Lux never spoke to Trip again.

765
01:14:39,276 --> 01:14:41,361
You're a stone fox.

766
01:14:46,659 --> 01:14:49,162
The girls' only contact with the outside…

767
01:14:49,245 --> 01:14:53,083
…was through catalogues they ordered
that filled their mailbox…

768
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:58,881
…with pictures of high-end fashions
and brochures for exotic vacations.

769
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:01,591
Unable to go anywhere…

770
01:15:01,675 --> 01:15:05,595
…the girls travelled in their
imaginations to Siamese temples…

771
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:10,811
…or passed an old man with a leaf broom
tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

772
01:15:13,105 --> 01:15:15,440
We ordered the same catalogues…

773
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:19,653
…and, flipping through the pages,
we hiked through passes with the girls…

774
01:15:19,736 --> 01:15:24,033
…stopping every now and then
to help them with their backpacks…

775
01:15:24,117 --> 01:15:27,329
…placing our hands
on their warm, moist shoulders…

776
01:15:27,412 --> 01:15:30,289
…and gazing off at papaya sunsets.

777
01:15:31,916 --> 01:15:34,628
We drank tea with them
in a water pavilion.

778
01:15:35,504 --> 01:15:37,589
We did whatever we wanted.

779
01:15:38,924 --> 01:15:42,887
Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

780
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:48,476
The only way
we could feel close to the girls…

781
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,523
…was through these impossible trips
which have scarred us forever…

782
01:15:53,606 --> 01:15:57,153
…making us happier
with dreams than wives.

783
01:15:59,071 --> 01:16:04,118
Collecting everything we could of theirs,
the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds.

784
01:16:04,202 --> 01:16:06,288
But they were slipping away.

785
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:11,835
The colour of their eyes was fading, along
with the locations of moles and dimples.

786
01:16:11,917 --> 01:16:14,004
From five they had become four…

787
01:16:14,087 --> 01:16:18,801
…and they were all living in the dead,
becoming shadows.

788
01:16:18,884 --> 01:16:22,514
We'd have lost them completely
if they hadn't contacted us.

789
01:16:22,597 --> 01:16:24,681
OK, one long…

790
01:16:25,433 --> 01:16:27,393
…two short…

791
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:30,147
- …and one long.
- Mm-hm.

792
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:31,982
You got that? That's it.

793
01:16:35,402 --> 01:16:37,488
"Help."

794
01:16:37,946 --> 01:16:40,033
"Send…

795
01:16:41,241 --> 01:16:43,161
…bo…

796
01:16:43,244 --> 01:16:44,746
…bo."

797
01:16:46,706 --> 01:16:48,208
- Bo-bo?
- Bo-bo.

798
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:51,338
That's what it says: bo-bo.

799
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:55,715
"Help send bo-bo"?
I thought you knew Morse code.

800
01:17:24,164 --> 01:17:26,251
Something here for you.

801
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:36,136
I got one, too.

802
01:17:38,472 --> 01:17:41,392
We racked our brains
for a way of contacting them.

803
01:17:41,474 --> 01:17:45,645
Tom Faheem suggested we fly a kite
with a message alongside the house…

804
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:47,982
…but that had logistical problems.

805
01:17:48,065 --> 01:17:51,360
In the end, the answer was so simple
it took a week to work out.

806
01:17:51,944 --> 01:17:54,028
We called them on the telephone.

807
01:17:54,363 --> 01:17:56,031
727…

808
01:17:56,115 --> 01:17:59,245
- …8221.
- 8221.

809
01:17:59,327 --> 01:18:01,621
Get ready.

810
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,251

01:18:08,796 --> 01:18:11,132

I'll see you later.

834
01:19:51,867 --> 01:19:55,202
- We're suffocating.
- You're safe here.

835
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:57,164
I can't breathe in here.

836
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:00,959
No answer.

837
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:25,361
- What time is it?
- Any time now.

838
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,406
- Guys, there it is.
- What?

839
01:20:32,368 --> 01:20:34,705
Yeah, it's them.

840
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:37,709
Let's go!

841
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:51,640
I have keys to my mom's car.

842
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,943
Shh!

843
01:21:15,749 --> 01:21:17,835
Maybe we should knock.

844
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:24,801
We're here.

845
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:37,313
About time.

846
01:21:37,398 --> 01:21:39,483
We've been waiting for you guys.

847
01:21:40,026 --> 01:21:43,447
We got a car, a full tank.
We'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

848
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:45,907
It's just a Cougar, but
it's got a big trunk.

849
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:48,118
Can I sit up front?

850
01:21:49,662 --> 01:21:51,121
Sure.

851
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:57,086
Which one of you
is gonna sit up front next to me?

852
01:21:58,463 --> 01:22:00,132
Where are your parents?

853
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:02,508
Asleep.

854
01:22:02,593 --> 01:22:06,013
- What about your sisters?
- They're coming.

855
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:09,308
Come on, it's getting late.

856
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:14,606
Wait five minutes. We had to wait
until my parents were asleep.

857
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:18,444
They take for ever.
My mom's an insomniac.

858
01:22:22,572 --> 01:22:25,284
We better take our car.
There's more room.

859
01:22:26,952 --> 01:22:29,246
Think you can handle a station wagon?

860
01:22:30,332 --> 01:22:33,374
Sure. It's not a stick, is it?

861
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,961
- No.
- Yeah, no problem.

862
01:22:36,213 --> 01:22:39,591
- Will you let me steer?
- Sure.

863
01:22:39,966 --> 01:22:43,220
But maybe we should go.
I heard somethin'. Could be your mom.

864
01:22:43,971 --> 01:22:46,056
Come on in.

865
01:22:56,025 --> 01:23:00,155
I'll go wait in the car.
You guys wait here for my sisters.

866
01:23:56,299 --> 01:24:00,261
These girls are making me crazy.
If I could feel one of'em up just once…

867
01:24:03,891 --> 01:24:05,559
What?

868
01:24:22,953 --> 01:24:26,290
We would never be sure
about the sequence of events.

869
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:28,877
We argue about it still.

870
01:24:32,005 --> 01:24:35,842
Most likely Bonnie had died while we
were waiting in the living room…

871
01:24:35,926 --> 01:24:38,011
…dreaming of highways.

872
01:24:39,054 --> 01:24:42,225
Mary put her head in the oven
shortly thereafter.

873
01:24:42,975 --> 01:24:47,647
Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills,
was gone by the time we got there.

874
01:24:48,398 --> 01:24:50,233
Lux was the last to go.

875
01:25:00,035 --> 01:25:04,332
It's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
Do you know where your children are?

876
01:25:20,182 --> 01:25:23,937
This has been Lydia Perl
with Channel 8 News.

877
01:25:33,155 --> 01:25:36,701
None of my daughters
lacked for any love.

878
01:25:38,161 --> 01:25:40,956
There was plenty of love in our house.

879
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:45,084
I never understood why…

880
01:26:17,036 --> 01:26:22,667
After the suicide free-for-all the Lisbons
gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.

881
01:26:25,003 --> 01:26:27,714
They had Mr Hedlie pack up the house…

882
01:26:27,797 --> 01:26:30,968
…selling what furniture he could
in a garage sale.

883
01:26:33,304 --> 01:26:35,806
Mr Lisbon put the house on the market…

884
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,810
…and it was sold to
a young couple from Boston.

885
01:26:39,436 --> 01:26:43,440
We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.

886
01:26:46,485 --> 01:26:51,406
We had pieces of the puzzle, but however
we put them together, gaps remained -

887
01:26:52,116 --> 01:26:55,911
…oddly shaped emptiness,
mapped by what surrounded them…

888
01:26:55,996 --> 01:26:58,330
…like countries we couldn't name.

889
01:27:01,709 --> 01:27:08,342
What lingered after them was not life,
but the most trivial list of mundane facts:

890
01:27:11,512 --> 01:27:13,681
…a clock ticking on the wall…

891
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:17,184
…a room dim at noon…

892
01:27:18,312 --> 01:27:22,899
…the outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.

893
01:27:27,572 --> 01:27:31,325
We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.

894
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,294
Our parents seemed
better able to do this…

895
01:27:41,378 --> 01:27:44,630
…returning to their tennis foursomes
and cocktail cruises…

896
01:27:44,716 --> 01:27:47,886
…as though they'd seen this all before.

897
01:27:48,343 --> 01:27:53,725
It was full-fledged summer again, over
a year since Cecilia had slit her wrists…

898
01:27:53,808 --> 01:27:56,394
…spreading the poison in the air.

899
01:27:56,477 --> 01:27:59,689
A spill at the plant
increased the phosphates in the lake…

900
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:04,069
…and produced a scum of algae so thick
that the swamp smell filled the air…

901
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:06,697
…infiltrating the genteel mansions.

902
01:28:07,698 --> 01:28:11,536
Debutantes cried over the misfortune
of coming out in a season…

903
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,581
…everyone would remember
for its bad smell.

904
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:18,752
The O'Conners, however,
came up with the ingenious solution…

905
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:23,090
…of making the theme of their daughter
Alice's debutante party "Asphyxiation ".

906
01:28:23,174 --> 01:28:27,137
Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.

907
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:30,515
She'll give him a heart attack!

908
01:29:15,604 --> 01:29:17,691
Hi, Parkie.

909
01:29:22,029 --> 01:29:24,532
Al's got the acting bug, you know.

910
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,453
She caught it from Pinkie.

911
01:29:29,621 --> 01:29:32,833
And I want to announce tonight
that next fall…

912
01:29:32,916 --> 01:29:36,253
…Alice is going to
a little school in New Haven

913
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:42,302
I hear they have
a great drama school out there.

914
01:29:42,385 --> 01:29:46,598
- In fact, Sam, didn't your father build it?
- That's the law school.

915
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:52,104
We're so proud of Alice.
We really couldn't be prouder.

916
01:30:00,236 --> 01:30:02,489
I've had it.

917
01:30:02,573 --> 01:30:04,785
Goodbye, cruel world.

918
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:13,627
No, no, no, you don't understand me!

919
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:16,214
I'm a teenager. I got problems!

920
01:30:26,809 --> 01:30:29,727
So much has been said
about the girls over the years.

921
01:30:32,523 --> 01:30:35,025
But we have never found an answer.

922
01:30:37,737 --> 01:30:40,948
It didn't matter in the end
how old they had been…

923
01:30:42,533 --> 01:30:44,619
…or that they were girls.

924
01:30:46,996 --> 01:30:49,875
But only that we had loved them…

925
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,461
…and that they hadn't heard us calling…

926
01:30:52,545 --> 01:30:56,674
…still do not hear us calling them
out of those rooms…

927
01:30:56,757 --> 01:30:59,719
…where they went to be alone
for all time…

928
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:05,516
…and where we will never find the pieces
to put them back together.

929
