你怎么弄成这样?       宝贝
What are you doing here, honey?

17
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,923
你还小未经世事
You're not even old enough to know how bad life gets.

18
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:14,385
显然 医生
Obviously, Doctor, you've never been a 13-year-old girl.

19
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:14,029
你从未当过13岁的女孩

25
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,525
每个人都记得我们的邻居
[narrator] <i>Everyone dates the demise of our neighborhood</i>

26
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:55,009
里斯本女孩们自杀的日子
<i>from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.</i>

27
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:59,013
人们在无精打采的榆树
<i>People saw their clairvoyance in the wiped-out elms,</i>

28
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,598
密歇根州 25年前
<i>the harsh sunlight,</i>

29
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,268
和日渐衰落的汽车工业中瞥见她们犀利的眼神
<i>and the continuing decline of our auto industry.</i>

30
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:07,480
年少的我们试着把碎片拼贴完整
<i>Even then, as teenagers, we tried to put the pieces together.</i>

31
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,400
仍是失败了
<i>We still can't.</i>

32
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:14,195
现在每当我们在商务餐会或鸡尾派对上相遇
<i>Now, whenever we run into each other at business lunches or cocktail parties,</i>

33
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,657
都会不由得在角落里重温那些证据
<i>we find ourselves in the corner going over the evidence one more time.</i>

34
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,952
只为了解那五个女孩
<i>All to understand those five girls...</i>

35
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,789
经过这么多年 她们仍铭刻在我们的脑海
<i>who, after all these years, we can't get out of our minds.</i>

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,128
塞西利亚 最小的一个 13岁
<i>Cecilia, the youngest, was 13.</i>

37
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:35,174
勒克斯 14岁
<i>And Lux was 14.</i>

38
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:40,054
邦妮 15岁
<i>Bonnie was 15.</i>

39
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:42,056
玛丽 16岁
<i>Mary was 16.</i>

40
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,937
特瑞丝17岁
<i>And Therese was 17.</i>

41
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:54,277
没人明白我们的数学老师
<i>No one could understand how Mrs. Lisbon and Mr. Lisbon, our math teacher,</i>

42
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,738
里斯本先生和她夫人
<i>had produced such beautiful creatures.</i>

43
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:57,429
怎么会造出这么美丽的尤物

44
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:04,287
保罗・巴蒂诺说
<i>Paul Baldino claimed to have found Cecilia on her first attempt.</i>

45
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:04,503
塞西利亚的初次自杀是他发现的

46
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,456
是我发现她的
Hey, I was the one who found her.

47
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,375
我站在我家的下水道里
[exhales] I was in the storm sewer under my house,

48
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,127
你能从那儿进入任何人的家
and there's all these tunnels.

49
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,254
我们信以为真
You can get into anyone's house.

50
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,590
[narrator] <i>So when Paul said this, we believed him</i>

51
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,301
因为他爸是美国大兵 鲨鱼巴蒂诺
<i>because he was the son of Sammy "The Shark" Baldino,</i>

52
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,054
我们知道他的逃生隧道经过下水道
<i>and we knew about his escape tunnel that led through the sewers.</i>

53
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:24,724
我是想去
So I went up, thinkin' I could see one of those Lisbon girls takin' a shower.

54
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:25,324
看她们洗澡

55
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,434
对 是的
- Yeah. - All right.

56
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,727
接着我进去了...到处都是血!
And I walk in...

57
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,188
and I see blood everywhere.

58
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:34,609
所以我转身 顺着隧道原路返回
So I turned around and went straight for the stairs and right back up the tunnel.

59
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,904
我必须告诉你们这事 回见
Had to tell you guys that story, so...

60
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,989
I'll see you guys later, all right?

61
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,827
我听说那是意外
[woman on phone] <i>I heard it was an accident.</i>

62
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,998
不 根本不是意外 只怪她父母
[woman 2] No, it was no accident, Joan. Of course the parents are to blame.

63
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,585
我听说他们在马桶里找到刀片
Well, I heard they found the razor in the toilet.

64
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,089
对塞西利亚自杀的原因 众说纷纭
[narrator] <i>Everyone had an opinion as to why Cecilia had tried to kill herself.</i>

65
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,091
她不想死
That girl didn't wanna die.

66
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,343
只是想从家里逃出来
She just wanted out of that house.

67
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,845
她想摆脱那种装潢方式
She wanted out of that decorating scheme.

68
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,723
[chuckles]

69
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,353
最流行的理论认为
[narrator] <i>The most popular theory held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.</i>

70
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,137
多米尼克・帕拉佐是罪魁祸首

71
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,815
多米尼克是个移民 暂时住在亲威家
<i>Dominic was the immigrant kid who was staying with relatives</i>

72
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,776
直到他的家人在新墨西哥安家
<i>until his family got settled in New Mexico.</i>

73
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,404
他是街坊里第一个戴墨镜的男孩
<i>He was the first boy in our neighborhood to wear sunglasses,</i>

74
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,532
来了还不到一周他就恋爱了
<i>and within a week of his arrival he'd fallen in love.</i>

75
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,158
他心仪的对象不是塞西利亚
[tennis ball hitting rackets]

76
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:27,662
<i>The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia, but Diana Porter.</i>

77
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,458
而是黛安娜・波特

78
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,917
我爱她!
[sighs]

79
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,502
I love her.

80
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,839
黛安娜去瑞士度假时 多米尼克逆天而行
<i>When Diana Porter left on vacation in Switzerland,</i>

81
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,841
<i>Dominic denounced God.</i>

82
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,092
为表真心
[boy] I don't know!

83
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:46,180
<i>And to prove the validity of his love, he jumped off the roof of his relatives' house.</i>

84
00:05:42,691 --> 00:06:08,928
他从亲戚家的房顶跳下去了

85
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,143
[mouths words]

86
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,188
[shrubbery rustling]

87
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,410
[exhales]

88
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,247
我要给你看一些图象
[clears throat] I'm gonna show you some images.

89
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,834
然后... 呃 你告诉我
And, uh, you tell me...

90
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,838
你想到了什么
what they remind you of.

91
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,050
好吗?
Okay?

92
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,234
香蕉
A banana.

93
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,909
沼泽
A swamp.

94
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,295
爆炸头
An Afro.

95
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,261
Mm-hmm.

96
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:21,067
我认为塞西利亚并不真想自杀
I don't think Cecilia truly meant to end her life.

97
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,196
她的举动是求助的呐喊
Her act was a cry for help.

98
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,949
我知道你们非常严格
I know you're very strict,

99
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,701
但建立一些校外社交关系
but I think that Cecilia would benefit

100
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,873
对塞西利亚十分有益
by having a social outlet outside of the codification of school...

101
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,419
跟同龄的男孩交往交往
where she could interact with males her own age.

102
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,114
彼得帮里斯本先生
[narrator] <i>Peter Sisten had helped Mr. Lisbon</i>

103
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:53,266
在教室建了个太阳系模型
<i>install a model of the solar system in his classroom,</i>

104
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,477
作为回报 里斯本先生请他来吃晚饭
<i>and in return Mr. Lisbon invited him for dinner.</i>

105
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,539
保佑我们 主啊为了这些
[Mr., Mrs. Lisbon] Bless us, O Lord, in these, thy gifts

106
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,898
我们因耶稣之慷慨而收到的礼物 阿门
which we are about to receive from thy bounty.

107
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,025
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

108
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,944
阿门
Amen.

109
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,530
勒克斯 把上衣穿上 抱歉
Lux, please. Put your shirt on this instant.

110
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,282
[Lux] Sorry.

111
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,412
谢谢 宝贝儿 把盐递过来好吗?
[Mrs. Lisbon] Thank you, dear.

112
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,414
[Cecilia] Can you pass the salt, please?

113
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,708
要火腿吗? 谢谢
- Ham? - Thank you.

114
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,502
甜心 要点儿豌豆吗? 我讨厌豌豆
[Mrs. Lisbon] Uh, sweetheart, would you like some peas?

115
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,629
- [Cecilia] I hate peas. - Here.

116
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,674
火腿看上去真不错 亲爱的
[Mrs. Lisbon] That's a nice-looking ham, dear.

117
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,511
谢谢 亲爱的 真不错 妈妈
[Mrs. Lisbon] Oh, thank you, honey.

118
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,305
[Bonnie] Mmm, this is good, Mom.

119
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:35,099
那么 彼得 你是个飞机狂热者吗?
So, Peter, are you, uh, an aviation enthusiast?

120
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,976
嗯 我不知道是否该把自己称作狂热者
- [clears throat] - Well, I, uh ―

121
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,521
I don't know if I'd call myself an enthusiast, but, uh, I like planes.

122
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,023
我喜欢飞机
- Oh, yeah? - [Cecilia] Thanks.

123
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,317
Ah. [chuckles]

124
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,070
彼得 你是橄榄球队的吗?
Uh, Peter, are you on ― on the football squad?

125
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:51,616
不 我玩儿这个 但不在队里
Um, no, I play it, but I'm not actually on the team.

126
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,428
哦 我知道了 不是队员
- [Mrs. Lisbon] Oh, I see. - [Mr. Lisbon] Not a team player. [chuckles]

127
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,996
你喜欢摔跤吗?
- Do you like to wrestle? - [coughs]

128
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,374
你还好吧?
- [Lux giggling] - [Mr. Lisbon] You okay, Peter?

129
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,545
一种巴西青蛙今天被列入濒危物种了
The Brazilian turbot frog was added to the endangered species list today.

130
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,507
今年的第三种了
- That's the third animal this year. - Oh, dear.

131
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,219
哦 宝贝儿 我头一次听说
The turbot frog. Darling, I don't think I've ever heard of it.

132
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,846
不好意思 我可以用一下厕所吗? 当然
Um, excuse me. May I use the restroom?

133
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,933
楼下的坏了
[Mrs. Lisbon] Oh, of course. The one down here isn't working very well.

134
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,994
去楼上塞西利亚的房间
- [clears throat] - Go upstairs, through Cecilia's room.

135
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:20,603

- [knocking] - Hold ― Hold on.

316
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,417
把夫人叫下来 聊一聊好吗?
How 'bout we get the missus down here, have a little chat?

317
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,295
恐怕她不舒服 I’m afraid she's under the weather.
Afraid she's under the weather.

318
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,255
她...
[clears throat] She's not really...

329
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,581

336
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,657
[knocks lightly]

337
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,492
我能进来吗? 好的
May I come in?

你们好 女孩们 我想我们可以谈谈
Hello, girls.

340
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,168
I thought we could talk.

341
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,796
你们想聊聊吗?
Do you feel like talking?

342
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:23,176
嗯... 如果你们想的话
Well, if you ever want to, you know where to find me.

343
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:24,558
你们知道到哪儿找我

344
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,272
里斯本太太? 我是穆迪神父
Mrs. Lisbon, it's Father Moody.

345
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,572
里斯本太太 你好
Mrs. Lisbon, hello.

346
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:52,831
我想告诉你
I wanted you to know that I listed Cecilia's death as an accident.

347
00:22:49,232 --> 00:23:06,778
塞西利亚的死是个意外

348
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,097
一场必然发生的意外
[woman murmuring] An accident waiting to happen.

349
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,558
他们无法自欺欺人
John said you couldn't get a policy to cover it.

350
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,643
真是太危险了
[woman 2] I know. It's so incredibly dangerous.

351
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,228
我们试试
Let's give it a try.

352
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,609
准备好了? 123
Ready?

353
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,444
One, two, three.

354
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,116
[woman whispers] Oh, God.

355
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,495
太悲伤了 真让我不敢相信
- It's just so sad, I can't even believe it. - Footings are too deep.

356
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,581
你车里的锁链呢?
You got that chain in your truck?

357
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,129
[truck engine starts]

358
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,560
开车!
Hit it!

359
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:15,163
我们收集的里斯本女孩的纪念品保存至今
[narrator] <i>Our collection of souvenirs of the Lisbon girls, which still exists,</i>

360
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,125
从塞西利亚的日记开始
<i>started with Cecilia's diary.</i>

361
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,253
帕克从水管工那儿弄来的
<i>Parkie had gotten it from Skip Ortega, the plumber's assistant,</i>

362
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,713
他在浴室的马桶边找到它
<i>who had found it next to the toilet in the bathroom.</i>

363
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,550
蒂姆・微纳是智者 解密了它
<i>Tim Weiner, the brain, decoded it.</i>

364
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,802
感情不稳定
Emotional instability.

365
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,097
看看"i"上的圆点 每个都如是
Look at the I's, the dots on 'em. They're everywhere.

366
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,936
基本上 她是个梦想家
Basically, what we have here is a dreamer,

367
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,480
一个完全与现实脱节的人
someone completely out of touch with reality.

368
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:43,024
她跳起来时 可能感觉自己要飞起来了
When she jumped, she probably thought she was flying.

369
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,609
Here.

370
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,282
2月13日 周一 今天我们吃的冰批萨
"Monday, February 13. Today we had frozen pizza.

371
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,413
周四 妈妈晚饭做了奶油玉米
Thursday. Mom made creamed corn for dinner.

372
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,331
糟透了 看上去就像...
It's the worst. It looks like ―"

373
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,379
玛丽像白痴一样撞烂了门牙
"Mary chipped her front tooth on the monkey bars, acting like an idiot.

374
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:08,049
她大吵大闹 还不得不去补牙
She made a big scene and had to go get her tooth capped. It looks normal, I guess."

375
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,759
我猜看上去没两样 给我
Here, give me that.

376
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,138
我就说她补过牙
I told you she had a capped tooth.

377
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:22,564
榆树! 一棵要死的树能写多少页?
Elm trees. How many pages can you write about dying trees?

378
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,109
这是有关多米尼克的
Here. Something about Dominic.

379
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:32,240
帕佐罗今天为了那阔绰婊子波特
"Palazzolo jumped off the roof today over that rich bitch Porter.

380
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:32,457
从屋顶上跳下来了

381
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,783
你还能再蠢点么?
How stupid can you be?"

382
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,247
今天我们乘船出海
"Today we went out on the boat. It was pretty cold.

383
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:40,507
很冷 我们看到了几只鲸鱼

384
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,499
勒克斯摸了鲸鱼 没想到它们这么臭
We saw a couple of whales.

385
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,437
Lux leaned over and stroked a whale. I didn't think they would stink so much.

386
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,172
是它们肚子里的海草烂了
It's the kelp in their baleens rotting.

387
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,591
我希望以后可以再去
I hope we can go again sometime."

388
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,468
读读这个吧
Hang on. Just read this. Read that.

389
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,553
勒克斯看上了凯文...
- "Lux lost it over Kevin..." - "Hines."

390
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,264
是"海兹"吗? 那个送垃圾的男人
- Is it "Hines"? The garbage man. - The garbage man.

391
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,851
勒克斯看上了凯文・海纳兹
[Cecilia] <i>Lux lost it over Kevin Heines, the garbage man.</i>

392
00:25:58,427 --> 00:26:00,017
那个送垃圾的男人

393
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:03,730
她早上5点起床 在前门台阶上转悠
<i>She'd wake up at 5:00 in the morning and hang out casually on the front steps,</i>

394
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,857
就跟别人看不出来似的!
<i>like it wasn't completely obvious.</i>

395
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,985
她把他的名字写在所有的内衣上
<i>She wrote his name in marker on all her bras and underwear.</i>

396
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,529
妈妈发现了 把所有凯文的字样都漂白了
<i>Mom found them and bleached out all the Kevins.</i>

397
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,990
勒克斯在床上哭了一整天
<i>Lux was crying on her bed all day.</i>

398
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,287
[no audible dialogue]

399
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:26,086
"这些树 像充满空气的肺叶"
<i>The trees, like lungs filling with air.</i>

400
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,422
"我姐姐 恶毒的那个 拉我的头发"
<i>My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair.</i>

401
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,347
于是我们得以知晓她们的生活
[narrator] <i>And so we started to learn about their lives...</i>

402
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,811
那些记忆汇集了我们未曾经历过的时光
<i>coming to hold collective memories of times we hadn't experienced.</i>

403
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,730
我们感受到作为女孩的被禁锢感
<i>We felt the imprisonment of being a girl,</i>

404
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,025
它是如何让你变得浮想联翩
<i>the way it made your mind active and dreamy</i>

405
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,696
让你了解到哪些颜色更搭
<i>and how you ended up knowing what colors went together.</i>

406
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,365
我们知道女孩们都有着缜密的内心
<i>We knew that the girls were really women in disguise,</i>

407
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:58,285
她们懂得爱情 甚至死亡
<i>that they understood love and even death,</i>

408
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:02,372
我们能做的就是吸引她们
<i>and that our job was merely to create the noise that seemed to fascinate them.</i>

409
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:07,127
她们对我们了如指掌
<i>We knew that they knew everything about us</i>

410
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,546
我们对她们却一无所知
<i>and that we couldn't fathom them at all.</i>

411
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,603

Um, I'm here to ask you a couple of questions, uh, about Cecilia.

417

是关于塞西利亚的

418

嗯? 好的 呃...
Yeah?

Oh, great, great.

或许你们能告诉我一点她的事?
Um, maybe you could start by, um, telling me a little bit about her.

421
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:52,047
Um, did she have any special interests or hobbies?

422
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:52,221
她有没有什么特殊的兴趣爱好?

423
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,550
她很喜欢写日记
Um, she liked to write in her journal a lot.

424
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,260
真棒
That is great.

425
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,012
好的 她有没...
Um, okay.

426
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:03,266
Uh, did she ― did she ever talk about ending her life?

427
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:03,407
她有说过要结束自己的生命吗?

428
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,894
出什么事了?
What's going on here?

429
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,355
你一定是里斯本太太
Um, you must be Mrs. Lisbon.

我是莉迪亚・皮尔 我为二频道做一档节目 I’m Lydia Perl. I’m doing a piece for Channel Two.
I'm Lydia Perl. I'm doing a piece for Channel 2 and ―

这儿不欢迎你 皮尔小姐
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

432
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,156
去年夏天 东部一位自杀少女
<i>The suicide of an east-side teenager last summer</i>

433
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:21,368
引发了国民危机意识
<i>has increased the awareness of a national crisis.</i>

434
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,621
我站在塞西利亚・里斯本家门前 一个13岁... I’m at the home where Cecilia Lisbon...
<i>I now stand in front of the home where Cecilia Lisbon, a 13-year-old...</i>

435
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,414
他们为什么不让她安息呢?
Why don't they just let her rest in peace?

436
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,208
...爱好写诗 悲剧性的结束了自己的生命
<i>...who liked to paint and write poetry,</i>

437
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,251
<i>tragically put an end to her life.</i>

438
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,754
心理学家一致认为 当代青少年
<i>Psychologists agree that adolescence today</i>

439
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:37,592
比起以前
<i>is much more fraught by pressures and complexities than in years past.</i>

440
00:28:35,806 --> 00:28:37,575
更加复杂与脆弱

441
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:41,846
越来越多的医生说挫败感能引起暴力行为
<i>More and more doctors say that this frustration can lead to acts of violence</i>

442
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:46,810
青少年无法将现实
<i>whose reality the adolescent cannot separate from its intended drama.</i>

443
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:48,753
与虚幻区分开来

444
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,605
我烤了一个有老鼠药的馅饼
<i>I baked a pie full of rat poison.</i>

445
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,025
我觉得我可以悄悄吃下它
<i>I thought I could eat it, you know,</i>

446
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,985

450
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,918
[sobbing]

451
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,925
我为这个母亲感到难过 I’m sorriest for the mother.
[woman on phone] <i>I feel sorriest for the mother.</i>

452
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,343
不 你一直想知道如何补救
[woman 2 on phone] <i>I know.</i>

453
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,863
<i>You would always wonder if there was something you could've done.</i>

454
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,533
我要挂了 再见
- [woman] <i>Well, I gotta go. See you later.</i> - [woman 2] <i>All right, then.</i>

455
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,142
好的 再见
<i>- Bye-bye. - Bye.</i>

456
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:28,391
再见

[chattering, faint]

459
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:03,178
[wooden wind chimes tinkling]

460
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,581
别担心
Don't worry.

461
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,501
他们把栅栏拆了
They took the fence out.

462
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,357
老天 你打鼾可够响的
God, you snore loud.

463
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:00,902
[alarm buzzes, stops]

[chattering]

465
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,613
那些女孩有光明的前途
[woman] Those girls have a bright future ahead of them.

466
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,117
另一个却已成定局
The other one was just gonna end up a kook.

467
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,496
直到9月7号
[narrator] <i>We didn't see the girls together as a group until convocation, September 7.</i>

468
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:54,572
我们才见到女孩们一块出现

469
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:58,376
玛丽 勒克斯 邦妮和特瑞丝
<i>Mary, Lux, Bonnie, and Therese</i>

470
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,920
来到学校 就像什么也没发生过
<i>came to school as though nothing had happened.</i>

471
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,922
我们觉得只要仔细看
<i>And we felt that if we kept looking hard enough,</i>

472
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:07,051
就会明白她们的感觉以及她们到底是谁
<i>we might begin to understand what they were feeling and who they were.</i>

473
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,512
好的 正如你记得的 这是维恩图
All right, so, if we have ―

474
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,681
And these are Venn diagrams, as you remember.

475
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:15,602
我们有'A'和'B'相交
If we have A and B intersecting,

476
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,604
这是'A'跟'B'
and A and B,

477
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,441
如果'A'与'B'相交 就得出这块区域
if A intersects B, we have this area.

478
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:25,695
如果'A'与'B'相并
And if A is the union with B, we have all of the circle

479
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,804
就得出整个圆和相交部分

480
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,196
这就是交集和并集的规则
plus the intersection.

481
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,535
These are the laws of intersection and union. Okay?

482
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,089
过的怎么样?
How's it going?

483
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,301
还不错
Not bad.

484
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:56,934
好的 "素描《淑女本色》...
Okay, do a character sketch on the following characters from <i>Portrait of a Lady.</i>

485
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,854
中的一个角色..."
The first one is... Ralph.

486
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,970
第一个是... 罗夫

487
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:03,107
呃... 他很好
Um... he was nice.

488
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,485
他死时我真的很难过
It was really sad when he died.

489
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,948
哦 上帝 真不敢相信我刚才说了什么
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe I just said that.

490
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,034
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

491
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:28,466
读到了惊人的自杀率
Reading about the alarming suicide rate,

492
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:32,011
我与伍德哈斯先生和其他几位老师谈过了
I talked to Mr. Woodhouse and some of the teachers here

493
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,848
意识到如此重大的问题
and realized that nothing about this serious matter

494
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,434
还未在学校里讨论过
has been discussed at this school.

495
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,813
随后就有绿色的小册子发下来
[narrator] <i>And quickly thereafter, green pamphlets were distributed.</i>

496
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:45,817
我们觉得绿色很欢快 也不算太欢快
[woman] <i>We thought green was cheerful, but not too cheerful.</i>

497
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,944
显然比红色要好
<i>Certainly better than red.</i>

498
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,615
册子里说
[narrator] <i>The green pamphlets told us that there were 80 suicides a day in America,</i>

499
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:52,786
美国一天有80起自杀

500
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,075
一年30,000起
<i>30,000 a year...</i>

501
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,493
茄子!
[all] Cheese!

502
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:58,204
这敲响了我们
<i>...and alerted us to danger signals we couldn't help but look for.</i>

503
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:58,529
一直在找寻的危险警报

504
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:01,040
里斯本的女孩子们瞳孔扩大了吗?
<i>Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?</i>

505
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,628
她们对校园活动
<i>Had they lost interest in school activities, in sports and hobbies?</i>

506
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:05,674
体育运动或爱好失去兴趣了吗?

507
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,172
她们被同龄人孤立了吗?
<i>Had they withdrawn from their peers?</i>

508
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,051
嗨 我是瑞斯 Hi, I’m Chase.
Hi. I'm Chase.

509
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:16,347
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

510
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:20,435
我这辈子就上过这一所学校
I've only been going to this school my whole life.

511
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,563
不用没话找话说
You don't have to talk to me.

512
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:36,492
比如说 我们有两种不同的经济类型
[man] So, for example, we have two different types of economics,

513
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,786
第一种叫做宏观经济
or so-called two different types of economics.

514
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,541
Now, the first one, we would say, is called macroeconomics, which is...

515
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,127
看
Look. She's laughing.

516
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:47,207
她在笑

517
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,131
他让她笑了
He made her laugh.

518
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,967
这条狗嘴里哪吐得出象牙!
I never heard him say anything remotely intelligent.

519
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:57,555
与勒克斯交谈的男孩
[narrator] <i>The boys who talked with Lux were always the stupidest boys</i>

520
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,391
总是很蠢 也套不出任何信息
<i>and made terrible sources of information.</i>

..手风琴 她挺好

告诉你吧 她绝对是学校里最辣的女孩
Let me tell you, she's the hottest girl in the school, for sure.

523
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:10,401
想知道发生什么了?闻我的手指吧 伙计
You wanna know what happened? Smell my fingers, man.

524
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,154
不 她不谈起塞西利亚
Nah, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

525
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,865
我们并没在说话 如果你知道我的意思
We weren't exactly talking, if you know what I mean.

526
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,661
认识勒克斯的唯一可靠的男孩
[narrator] <i>But the only reliable boy who actually got to know Lux...</i>

527
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,372
是崔普・方汀
<i>was Trip Fontaine,</i>

528
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,877
他最近减掉了婴儿肥
<i>who, only eight months before the suicides, had emerged from baby fat</i>

529
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,214
这很让女孩和妈妈们高兴
<i>to the delight of girls and mothers alike.</i>

530
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:33,841
我又迟到了
[whispers] I'm late again.

我们学校的所有女孩都爱上了崔普

<i>All the girls except for Lux.</i>

崔普说 他是从上错第五节历史课
<i>Trip told us his passion for Lux Lisbon all started</i>

555
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,441
开始迷上勒克斯的
<i>when he went into the wrong history class during fifth period.</i>

556
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:17,445
按照惯例 他在外边抽大麻
<i>As was his custom, he went out to his car to smoke the marijuana</i>

557
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:22,325
他像糖尿病童打胰岛素一样按时吸食大麻
<i>he took as regularly as Peter Petrovich, the diabetic kid, took his insulin.</i>

<i>On this particular day he ran into Mr. Woodhouse in the hall</i>

559
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,753
溜进一间教室
<i>and ducked into the nearest class.</i>

560
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,770
她是这个旋转世界中的静点
[Trip] <i>She was the still point of the turning world, man.</i>

561
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,482
我从未忘记过她 从来没有
I never got over that girl.

562
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:55,942
Never.

563
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,405
我爱过很多女人 但跟那不一样...
I mean, you know, I loved a lot of ladies, but not like that.

564
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,115
那是真的
That was real.

565
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:06,204
我永远忘不了第一次见她

566
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,077
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.

567
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,287
我不知道是什么打动了我 我不知道该怎么办
I didn't know what had hit me.

568
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,915
I-I didn't know what to do.

569
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,835
因为与别的女孩总是得心应手
It was so easy with all the other girls.

570
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:17,254
但她看都不看我
But she wouldn't look at me.

571
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,256
我...我不是主动追人的类型
I, uh ―

572
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,843
I was never the kind to pursue, if you know what I mean.

573
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:26,763
如果你知道我的意思

574
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,058
她让我疯狂 伙计
That girl drove me crazy, man.

575
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,450
真好吃
- Mmm, yummy. Warm. - Mm-hmm.

576
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,619
勒克斯?
Hey, Lux.

577
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,121
嘿
Hey.

578
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,085
看看 只是面包片加肉而已
[Bonnie giggles] Look at him.

579
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,879
- It's just meat on bread. - Ew. Sick.

580
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,340
谢谢 妈妈
Thanks, Mom.

581

[man] <i>? I can think of younger days ?</i>

[narrator] <i>Trip's dad was little help.</i>

585
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:15,312
[R&B ballad continues playing]

586
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:19,817
嗯 首先 别给她打电话
Well, first off, don't call her on the phone.

587
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,945
这... 很奥妙
It's all, um ― It's all subtlety.

588
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,780
有细微的差别
It's all nuance.

589
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:27,908
是的 你只要在学校跟她说说话
Yeah, yeah. You just need to talk to her at school, you know.

590
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:31,996
什么都行
About anything. About, uh, the weather or school assignments.

591
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:32,329
天气... 或作业

592
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,583
只要找到
Um, you know, anything to have the chance to communicate

593
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:38,544
用眼神交流的机会
with the language of eye contact.

594
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,130
还有对计划的信心
A-And, uh, project confidence.

595
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:45,176
别让头发挡着眼
And, uh, keep the hair out of your eyes.

596
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,137
感受那气氛
She'll feel the vibe.

597
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,681
<i>? How can you mend ?</i>

598
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,809
<i>? A broken heart? ?</i>

00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,436
<i>? Oh ?</i>

600
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,521
做你自己就好了 对
- And be yourself. - Yeah.

601
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:02,068
- [dramatic music on soundtrack] - [wind howling]

602
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:06,113
"飓风"是自然界
[movie: narrator] <i>The word "hurricane" is the name given to nature's strongest storm.</i>

603
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:07,264
最强的风暴

604
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:10,868
当高压气团与低压气团相遇时
<i>A hurricane occurs when high pressure and low pressure masses of air</i>

605
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,162
就会形成飓风
<i>come in contact with one another.</i>

606
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:18,793
两种气团通常
<i>There is often a significant difference in temperature between the two masses.</i>

607
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:20,811
存在显著的气温差异

608
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:23,339
一种是暖的 另一种是冷的
<i>One mass is warm, while the other is cold.</i>

609
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:28,427
暖气团上升 冷气团下降
<i>The warmer air rises and the cooler air falls.</i>

610
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:35,142
同时 低压气团
<i>Likewise, the low pressure area slides down the sides of the high pressure area.</i>

611
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:35,425
从高压气团的边缘滑下

612
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:39,605
它们互相绕着彼此打转
<i>They swirl in and around one another, creating the beginnings of the storm.</i>

613
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:39,223
这就是风暴的开始

614
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:42,399
[thunderclap]

615
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:46,403
从这幅

美国海军气象巡逻机拍的图象来看

617
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,156
我们可以发现
<i>we can clearly observe the two masses ―</i>

618
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,826
高低压气团
<i>one high pressure and one low pressure ―</i>

00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,328
彼此接触了

- [wind howling] - [dramatic music continues]

621
00:40:57,414 --> 00:41:00,543
结果产生了极具破坏性
<i>The result is a surging storm of tremendous strength</i>

622
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03,295
而且强有力的大风暴
<i>that strikes with forceful determination.</i>

[thunder crashing, rumbling]

624

尽管飓风
<i>Even though the hurricane is the most powerful storm known to all of us ―</i>

625
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,116
是我们所知的最强风暴

626
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,432
它袭击大块陆地
- [loud fart] - [students laughing]

627
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:19,061
比如大洲或大的岛屿
<i>as it strikes large land areas, such as continents or large islands,</i>

628
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:21,063
而且消退缓慢
<i>it slowly dies.</i>

629
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,627
是蒙特顾马先生 他最恶心了
[whispering] That must've been Conley.

00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:32,248
我对你女儿的意图是真心的

702
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:34,251
什么意图?
What might those intentions be?

703
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:37,713
邀勒克斯去校园舞会
I wanna ask Lux to the homecoming dance.

704
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:43,469
崔普 先坐下吧
Trip, why don't you sit down for a minute.

705
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:44,970
All right.

706
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:50,184
你知道 我妻子和我有明确的规则
You see, my wife and I have certain rules.

707
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:53,061
这约束了大女儿
They've been the same rules for the older girls,

708
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:56,106
我不能为了小女儿开先例
and I can't very well go and change them now for the younger ones.

709
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,776
就算我想 我妻子也不会同意的
Even if I wanted to, the wife wouldn't let me. [chuckles] It's true.

710
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:04,156
所以 如果你想再来看电视
So, uh, if you wanna come over and watch television again,

711
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,741
那可以
that would be fine.

712
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:09,786
但你不能带勒克斯出去 特别是乘车
But you cannot take Lux out, especially not in a car.

713
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,706
所以不好意思 年轻人 这是我们的规矩 So I’m sorry, son, that's just our policy.
So, I'm sorry, son. That's just our policy.

714
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:19,755
好的 先生 如果我们几个男孩
Okay, sir, what if ― what if there was a bunch of us guys

715
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,382
邀请你所有女儿们
and we took all your daughters out in a group

716
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:25,219
并在你规定的时间把她们送回去呢?
and we had 'em back by whatever time that you said?

717
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:27,137
你是橄榄球队的吗? 是的 先生
You on the football squad son?

718
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:30,516
什么位置? 四分卫
- Yes, sir. - Oh. What position?

719
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:31,892
Defensive corner back.

720
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:34,353
好样的
Ah. Well, uh, good. Good.

721
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:37,523
我以前... 我当年可是中卫
I was a ― [clears throat] I was a safety in my day.

722
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:39,942
嗯 那是个重要位置 先生
Well, that's a crucial position, sir.

723
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:42,861
得分全靠你了 不错!
- Nothing between you and the goal line. - Exactly. Exactly.

724
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,863
哦 好吧 是这样的 先生
- [school bell rings] - Uh, well...

726
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:52,079
之后还有舞会
and then afterwards we have the dance and everything, and...

727
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,498
其他人都有舞伴了
like, all the other guys are taking dates.

728
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,669
你很帅 很多女孩愿意跟你出去
You're a good-looking fellow, Trip. Lots of girls would go with you, I bet.

729
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:02,631
我对她们不感兴趣 先生 I’m not interested in lots of girls, sir.
Yeah, well, I'm not interested in lots of girls, sir.

730
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,849
我会跟我妻子商量的 崔普 我尽量 I’ll take it up with the wife, Trip. Do what l can.
I'll take it up with the wife, Trip, do what I can.

731
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:16,103
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

732
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:20,482
这可是门手艺
- It's a classic. It's really dark. - Oh.

733
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,694
Mmm.

734
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,413
崔普・方汀和几个橄榄球队的男孩

735
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,957
想带她们去校园舞会

方汀先生 能跟你说句话吗?
Mr. Fontaine, may I speak with you, please?

741
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,936
关于你的请求 我和我妻子已经决定了...
[clears throat] Now, my wife and I have, uh, had a little talk,

742
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,397
and we've come to a decision about your request.

743
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,400
[no audible dialogue]

744
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,696
[Mr. Lisbon] Okay?

00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:44,733
崔普 伙计 你欠我的
Trip, man, you owe me.

754
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,170
我那次从伍德哈斯手里救了你一命

谁带谁? 各凭本事吧
- Who's taking who? - Whom.

761
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:02,834
They're just gonna raffle us off.

762
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:07,982
女孩们选择哪件并不要紧
[narrator] <i>It didn't make any difference which pattern of their dream dresses</i>

763
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,633
<i>the girls each chose.</i>

764

772
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:37,494

773
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,204
真兴奋!
I'm so excited.

774
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:41,748
You're in my way.

775
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,001
[tires squeal]

776
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:49,005
[engine off]

777
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,348

行动吧
Let's do it.

781
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:13,780
最后帕克因为那辆大众而胜出
[narrator] <i>In the end, Parkie won because of the Cadillac,</i>

782
00:51:13,864 --> 00:51:16,616
凯文・海德因为超猛的大麻
<i>Kevin Head because he had the killer weed,</i>

783
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,703
还有周・黑尔・克拉尼 因为他获奖无数
<i>and Joe Hill Conley because he won all the school prizes,</i>

784
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:22,581
崔普认为这些能打动里斯本夫妇
<i>which Trip thought would impress Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon.</i>

785
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:27,294
你们好 男孩们       你好 里斯本太太

788
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:45,896
谁开车?       是我
Uh, who ― who's driving?

789
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:47,105
你有驾照多长时间了?
I am.

790
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:49,316
How long have you had your license?

791
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,959
两个月 但我学了一年
Two months, but I had my learner's permit for a year before that.

792
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:54,738
她们几乎没有乘车出去过
You know, we ― we almost never allow the girls to go out in cars

793
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,364
unless it's necessary.

794
00:51:56,448 --> 00:52:00,368
最近有很多车祸
There's so many accidents nowadays. I'm sure you will be very careful.

795
00:51:58,187 --> 00:52:01,444
你们要小心       好的

796
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:03,455

I better get going. I'll see you at the dance, huh?

799
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:12,547
到时见 里斯本先生
- See you there, Mr. Lisbon. - Okay.

800
00:52:12,631 --> 00:52:14,966

803
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:25,977
男孩们来了
The boys are here.

804
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,004
我们选的白色 因为不知道你们要穿什么
We got white ones.

805
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,674
花店的人说白色百搭
We didn't know what you were wearing.

806
00:52:55,757 --> 00:53:00,387
The guy, the flower guy, said that white would go with anything, so...

807
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:03,390
很高兴你选白色 I’m glad you got white.
I'm glad you got white.

808
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,352
为什么不帮她们别上呢?
[Mrs. Lisbon] Why don't you pin them on?

809
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,648
Yeah.

810
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:14,484
Here.

811
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:19,823
[all murmuring]

812
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:22,492
[Lux] Don't stick me.

813
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:25,328
- [laughing] - Almost, almost.

814
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,263
- This isn't... gonna work. - [chattering]

815
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,335
崔普
- Just ― [chuckles] - Popped off right away.

816
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:34,754
- Oh. - [laughing]

817
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,965
好了 好了       我们走吧
There we go. All right.

818
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:39,718
太好了
- Let's do it. - All right.

819
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,303
再见 妈妈
Bye, Mom.

820
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:43,263
Bye.

821
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:47,058
Hi.

822
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:55,233
上帝 看啊! 那辆车又停在那儿了!
Oh, my gosh. Look, you guys. Her car's there late again.

823
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:57,861
我确定李先生跟她有一腿 I’m sure Mr. Lea's having an affair with her.
[Bonnie] I'm sure Mr. Leo's having an affair with the maid.

824
00:53:57,944 --> 00:54:00,280
我见过他跟着她进了洗衣室
I saw him follow her into the laundry room.

825
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:02,949
他那个红鼻子真可悲
[Therese] Ew! He's so fat, and that red nose.

826
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:05,744
可能是个酒鬼
- Totally an alcoholic. - Yeah, and what about the Hessens?

827
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:08,997
海兹家的人呢？你知道他们是纳粹
- You know they're Nazis. - They're Nazi sympathizers, Bonnie.

828
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:09,272
是纳粹的拥护者

829
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,000
他们在史沃兹小姐
They had a fit when the Schwartzmans tried to join the tennis club.

830
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,543
进网球俱乐部时大发雷霆
[laughing]

831
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,837
铝边侧线不错!他们真觉得这样没问题吗?
[Lux] Nice aluminum siding.

832
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,964
Do they really think that looks okay?

833
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:20,967
彼特丝先生从电视上订的
You know Mr. Kreigers ordered that from TV late at night.

834
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:23,678
那是巴蒂诺家的烧烤木桩
Look, it's the Baldinos' barbecue tree stump.

835
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:26,473
我从没见过他们在那上面烧烤!
I have never seen them barbecue on that thing.

01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:45,294
女孩们被禁止上学
<i>The girls were taken out of school,</i>

983
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:49,465
里斯本太太
<i>and Mrs. Lisbon shut the house in maximum security isolation.</i>

984
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:50,456
以最大的安全措施封锁了她家

985
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:54,512
她不止不让女孩们上学
<i>She had done more than just take the girls out of school.</i>

986
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:57,848
那个星期天 在一场教堂说教后
<i>That Sunday, arriving home from a spirited church sermon,</i>

987
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:01,102
里斯本太太让勒克斯销毁她的唱片
<i>Mrs. Lisbon commanded Lux to destroy her rock records.</i>

988
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:02,895
快点!
Now.

989
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:05,022
但是 妈妈...
[crying] But, Mom.

990
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:07,525
我最后再说一遍 勒克斯
This is final, Luxie.

991
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,360
这不公平       我说快点
That's not fair!

992
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:11,362
I said, now.

993
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:16,200
[sighs]

994
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:30,423
就现在 勒克斯!
Now, Luxie!

995
01:07:30,506 --> 01:07:32,007
[crying continues]

996
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,730
快点儿
Come on.

997
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:47,314
Hold on.

998
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:54,029
热吻乐队 请别让我这么做
KISS. Please don't make me do this.

999
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,614
烧了它
Burn it.

1000
01:08:02,747 --> 01:08:04,373
[crying continues]

1001
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:10,713
妈妈 空中铁匠!
Oh, Mom. Aerosmith.

1002
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,757
拜托 别让我这么做
- Come on. Please, don't make me burn this. - No.

1003
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,050
拜托...
Please. [coughing]

1004
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,386
什么味道?
[Bonnie] What's that smell?

1005
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:20,681
好吧 先至此为止
[Mrs. Lisbon coughs] It's ― All right. Um, that'll do for now.

1006
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:22,725
给我 给我
Give me these. Give me these.

1007
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,728
我扔到垃圾箱里 I’ll put them in the trash.
I'll put them in the trash.

1008
01:08:32,735 --> 01:08:34,403
[coughing]

1009
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:48,834
[chainsaw motor revving]

1010
01:08:58,219 --> 01:09:02,139
[man] Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

1011
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:05,577
从此我们开始看见勒克斯
[narrator] <i>This was around the time we began to see Lux</i>

1012
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:08,270
在屋顶跟不同男人做爱
<i>making love on the roof with random boys and men.</i>

1013
01:09:08,354 --> 01:09:10,582
她脱光了吗?       看不出来
- [Tim] What else? Come on. Is she naked? - [Chase] What's she doing?

1014
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:12,926
对准
- [Parkie] You can't tell. Hold on. - [Tim] Get it focused.

1015
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,861
别吵了 等轮到你再说
- You're pushin' it. What are you doing? - Will you stop?

1016
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:17,947
他们在干什么?
- Wait your turn. - What are they doing?

1017
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,366
他们在滚来滚去
[Parkie] They're rolling around up there.

1018
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,284
等等 她在他上面
Let me see. Let me see. Off.

1019
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:23,928
- Hold on. - [Chase] All right, come on.

1020
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,473
他的手插在她头发里
And she's on him. And he's rubbing his hands through her hair.

1021
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:27,957
让我看看       不 这是我的望远镜 瑞斯
- Let me have a look. - No. No, no.

1022
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,417
It's my t ― It's my telescope, Chase.

1023
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,754
好的 还有什么?
- [laughs] - [Tim] Yes, and what else?

1024
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,967
那男人穿着汉堡屋的制服
Our male up there seems to be in a Burger Chalet uniform.

1025
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,885
给我看看
[Tim] Let me see.

1026
01:09:39,969 --> 01:09:41,804
是啊谁知道下一个有艳遇的是谁
Is it ― Yeah, the Burger Chalet ―

1027
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:44,515
You never think that those guys, you know, ever get lucky.

1028
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:48,143
接着她问我 刚才的事算不算下流
She turns to me and asks me if I thought what we had just done was dirty.

1029
01:09:48,227 --> 01:09:50,563
我知道该怎么说 我说不是
I knew what to say. I said no.

1030
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:53,649
接着她拉着我的手问"你喜欢我 是吗?"
Then she grabs my hand and goes, "You like me, don't you?"

1031
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:56,861
我什么也没说 最好让小妞们猜测
I didn't say anything. You know, it's best to keep chicks guessing.

1032
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:01,574
瑞斯 宝贝儿 晚饭前得练习小提琴
[woman] Chase, honey, come practice your violin before dinner.

1033
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,578
你不会相信的
You're not gonna believe it.

1034
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:08,581
勒克斯今晚又上屋顶了!
Lux is on the roof again tonight.

1035
01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:11,709
她的手在下滑 我得看看
- Her hands are moving down. - I gotta see this.

1036
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,544
太美了       现在是她在上面了
- Oh. - This is beautiful.

1037
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,921
Now she's on top of him.

1038
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:18,924
她在做什么 伙计?       等等
- What's she doin', man? - Wait.

1039
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:22,678
现在做完了 他起来了
Now they're done. He's getting up.

1040
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:26,724
就这样? 真是快
That's it?

1041
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:28,767
That was quick.

1042
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:39,236
...再加1 如果指数是时间
[sighs] "N" plus one, and, uh,

1043
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,489
if the dimension is time, then you would have as your approach ―

1044
01:10:40,919 --> 01:10:42,698
那我们就有...

1045
01:10:42,573 --> 01:10:46,035
早安
Oh, good morning. Good morning ― [murmurs]

1046
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:48,996
用光合作用做早餐了吗?
Have we photosynthesized our breakfast today?

1047
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,666
[locker clattering]

1048
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,049
[muttering]

1049
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:01,634
你好 罗纳德 嗨 哈里
Hello, Ronald.

1050
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,303
Hi, Eric.

1051
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:07,973
你的女儿们已经两周没来上学了
Your daughters haven't been in school for over two weeks.

1052
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:12,186
你查过了?
You checked out back?

1053
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:19,526
他们找了个新数学老师
[Mrs. Buell] <i>Dini Flasher said they found a new math teacher.</i>

1054
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:22,464
他得找新工作了 我知道
Well, he's gonna have to get another job, that's for sure.

1055
01:11:22,488 --> 01:11:23,989
I know.

1056
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:28,118
女孩们还要这样被关多久?
How long can those girls be cooped up like that?

1057
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:38,629
[motor revving]

1058
01:11:48,764 --> 01:11:50,307
走开 这是我们的树
Just go away. This is our tree.

1059
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:54,019
女孩们 女孩们...为时已晚 这棵树已经死了
Girls. Girls, it's a little late.

1060
01:11:54,103 --> 01:11:55,479
为什么不让它自生自灭呢?
Okay, this tree is dead.

1061
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,165
Why don't you just leave it up to nature?

1062
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:59,250
那样所有树都会死
If we left it up to nature, there'd be no trees left.

1063
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:01,402
反正最后结果也一样
[scoffs] That's what it's gonna be like anyway.

1064
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:03,445
如果真菌没从欧洲扩散
If the boats didn't bring the fungus from Europe,

1065
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:05,614
就不会这样了
none of this would've happened in the first place.

1066
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:08,617
好的 走吧
Okay. Let's go.

1067
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:11,328
不走?
No?

1068
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,706
这样 我收到命令要砍掉你们的榆树
All right, that's it.

1069
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:16,792
I have an order to cut down your elm tree, but your kids won't let us.

1070
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,168
但你的孩子们不让
Dear?

1071
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:20,587
你怎么知道树有病
- How do you know that tree's sick? - Believe me, we know.

1072
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:22,941
相信我 它叶子都黄了
It had yellow leaves. The tree is dead, for Christ's sake.

1073
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:25,592
真的死了 it’s dead for Christsake.
Are you familiar with Aritex? Our daughter showed us an article.

1074
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:24,355
知道毒疗法吗

1075
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:27,570
我女儿给我看的文章
- It's a less aggressive therapy. - And it doesn't work.

1076
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:26,699
里说这创伤较小

1077
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:29,096
没用
- Ah. - I leave that tree there,

1078
01:12:27,603 --> 01:12:29,900
要是把它留着 明年所有树都会死

1079
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:30,597
早晚都会死嘛
they'll all be gone by next year.

1080
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:32,433
Will be anyway... way things are going.

1081
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:34,869
听着 我不想打电话给警察
Look, I don't wanna have to call the police.

1082
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:37,414
我女儿站在自家草坪上
[Mrs. Lisbon] Our daughters are simply standing on their own front lawn.

1083
01:12:37,438 --> 01:12:39,273
这犯哪门子的罪?
Since when is that a crime?

1084
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,862
[Mr. Lisbon] Uh ―

1085
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,995
[chainsaw motor revving]

1086
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,374
克里弗 看到那些穿睡衣的女孩了吗?
Clyde? Did you see those girls in the ― in the nighties?

1087
01:12:57,458 --> 01:13:00,169
就拍那儿 That's what I want. That’s the shot that l want.
That's what I want. That's the shot that I want. Okay?

1088
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:03,064
亲爱的 再往前一点
Honey, you're gonna have to move forward. I want those girls in the nighties.

1089
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:04,631
我想拍穿睡衣的女孩
Oh, God. Okay.

1090
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:07,092
后面一点 放松点
Here, let's just back up a little bit here.

1091
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:10,095
- [cameraman] Give me some slack. - There you go. Is that good?

1092
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:11,805
好了 这样行吗? 好
- Okay? - Great.

1093
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:15,893
去年引起国内一片哗然的
<i>Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon, the east-side teenager</i>

1094
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:20,189
东部自杀少女塞西利亚・里斯本
<i>whose suicide last summer focused awareness on a national problem,</i>

1095
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,976
她的四个姐姐关注全国性的问题

1096
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:22,024
不顾危险
<i>put their own lives in jeopardy</i>

1097
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:25,778
想保护塞西利亚深爱的榆树
<i>by trying to protect the elm that Cecilia so dearly loved.</i>

1098
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:29,198
[chainsaw motor whirring]

1099
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:05,609
[birds chirping]

1100
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:16,870
一阴天你的黑眼圈就很明显
[Mary] The circles under your eyes come out more when you're in overcast.

1101
01:14:16,954 --> 01:14:19,456
你得涂...
All right? So you need to wear more concealer when it's cloudy.

1102
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:22,835
接下来的几个星期 我们基本见不到她们
[narrator] <i>For the next few weeks, we hardly saw the girls at all.</i>

1103
01:14:24,128 --> 01:14:26,964
乔依并没照约定给特瑞丝打电话
<i>Joe Hill Conley didn't call Therese as he had promised.</i>

1104
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,716
So we need more colors.

1105
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:34,972
勒克斯再也没跟崔普说过话
<i>And Lux never spoke to Trip again.</i>

1106
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:37,599
[Mary] So, you should tone it down a bit. But in the shade ―

1107
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:40,686
你真是人间尤物
[Trip's voice] <i>You're a stone fox.</i>

1108
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:48,402
女孩们与世界的唯一联系
[narrator] <i>The girls' only contact with the outside world</i>

1109
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,487
是她们订的杂志
<i>was through the catalogs they ordered</i>

1110
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:52,614
她们的邮箱里
<i>that started to fill the Lisbons' mailbox</i>

1111
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:57,494
充满了时尚图片
<i>with pictures of high-end fashions and brochures for exotic vacations.</i>

1112
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:57,986
还有异国旅游手册

1113
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:01,915
因为不能外出
<i>Unable to go anywhere, the girls traveled in their imaginations</i>

1114
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:03,741
她们乘着想像游览暹罗神庙

1115
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:04,376
<i>to gold-tipped Siamese temples,</i>

1116
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:09,131
又或经过
<i>or past an old man with a leaf broom tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.</i>

1117
01:15:06,698 --> 01:15:08,831
打扫满地青苔的日本老人

1118
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,928
我们订了同样的杂志
<i>We ordered the same catalogs,</i>

1119
01:15:15,012 --> 01:15:18,974
与她们在蒙尘的小道上远足
<i>and flipping through the pages, we hiked through dusty passes with the girls,</i>

1120
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:22,186
时不时停下
<i>stopping every now and then to help them with their backpacks...</i>

1121
01:15:20,638 --> 01:15:23,545
帮她们整理背包

1122
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:26,690
将手放在她们温暖 湿润的肩膀上
<i>placing our hands on their warm, moist shoulders,</i>

1123
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:29,109
共赏日落的余辉
<i>and gazing off at papaya sunsets.</i>

1124
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:34,323
我们和她们一起在凉亭喝茶
<i>We drank tea with them in a water pavilion.</i>

1125
01:15:34,406 --> 01:15:36,366
我们随心所欲
<i>We did whatever we wanted.</i>

1126
01:15:38,202 --> 01:15:39,953
塞西利亚没有死 她是加尔各答的新娘
<i>Cecilia hadn't died.</i>

1127
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:42,873
<i>She was a bride in Calcutta.</i>

1128
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,753
无法实现的旅行
<i>The only way we could feel close to the girls</i>

1129
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:51,632
是我们走近她们的唯一方法
<i>was through these impossible excursions, which have scarred us forever...</i>

1130
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:52,671
那让我们铭记终生

1131
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:56,178
这些梦比真实的女人更让我们快乐
<i>making us happier with dreams than wives.</i>

1132
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,724
我们收集她们所有的东西
<i>Collecting everything we could of theirs,</i>

1133
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:03,435
女孩们萦绕在我们脑海里
<i>the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds.</i>

1134
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:05,896
但她们在消逝
<i>But they were slipping away.</i>

1135
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:10,567
她们眼睛的颜色渐渐淡去
<i>The color of their eyes was fading, along with the exact locations of moles and dimples.</i>

1136
01:16:08,052 --> 01:16:11,226
连同消失的酒窝

1137
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:13,278
五个变成了四个
<i>From five they had become four,</i>

1138
01:16:13,362 --> 01:16:16,198
如行尸走肉般活着...
<i>and they were all, the living and the dead,</i>

1139
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:18,825
变成了影子
<i>becoming shadows.</i>

1140
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:21,828
如果她们没有联系我们
<i>We would have lost them completely if the girls hadn't contacted us.</i>

1141
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,370
我们就彻底失去她们了

1142
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:23,705
1长 2短
[Chase] Okay, one long.

1143
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,708
Two short.

1144
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:29,044
1长 记下了?
- And one long. - Mm-hmm.

1145
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,296
就这样 好的
You got that? That's it.

1146
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:33,548
Okay.

1147
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:36,260
救助
Help.

1148
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:38,929
送来
Send...

1149
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:42,057
bo...

1150
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:44,059
bo.

1151
01:16:45,978 --> 01:16:47,479
Bobo? Bobo 就是这个... Bobo
- Bobo? - Bobo.

1152
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,690
I just ― Watch this.

1153
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:50,774
"救助 送来Bobo" 我还以为你懂摩尔斯密码!
Bobo.

1154
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,318
Help send bobo?

1155
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:55,028
I thought you knew Morse code.

1156
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:25,600
有东西给你
Something here for you.

1157
01:17:25,839 --> 01:17:28,563
记得我们吗? 你会帮忙吗? 给瑞斯

1158
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:33,233
我也收到一张
[door closes]

1159
01:17:33,317 --> 01:17:35,277
I got one too.

1160
01:17:36,039 --> 01:17:37,745
亲爱的无论是谁 告诉催普我不爱他了 他是个混蛋

1161
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:40,657
我们绞尽脑汁地想联系她们
[narrator] <i>We racked our brains for a way of contacting them.</i>

1162
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:44,953
汤姆建议我们往她们家放风筝
<i>Tom Fahey suggested we fly a kite with a message alongside the house,</i>

1163
01:17:42,977 --> 01:17:45,086
上面绑上纸条

1164
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:47,664
但这有逻辑上的错误
<i>but that had logistical problems.</i>

1165
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:50,667
最后 答案很简单
<i>In the end, the answer was so simple it took a week to come up with.</i>

1166
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:53,337
我们给她们打电话
<i>We called them on the telephone.</i>

1167
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,214
- [line buzzing] - 727-8221.

1168
01:17:56,298 --> 01:17:57,966
8221.

1169
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,760
准备
- [line ringing] - Get ready.

1170
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:04,514
你好? 行动!
- [Mary] <i>Hello?</i> - Go.

1171
01:18:08,018 --> 01:18:10,437
嗨 是我
[man] <i>? Hello, it's me ?</i>

1172
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:18,153
我为你我的关系苦恼了很久
<i>? I've thought about us For a long, long time ?</i>

1173
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:20,572
打给我们 7270487
Call us. 727-0487.

1174
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:22,240
<i>? But something's wrong ?</i>

1175
01:18:25,494 --> 01:18:28,121
该死 是她们
- [phone rings] - Shit. It's them.

1176
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,710
[pop intro playing]

1177
01:18:33,794 --> 01:18:36,588
回首昨日
[man] <i>? To think that only yesterday ?</i>

1178
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:39,383
我曾无忧无虑
<i>? I was cheerful, bright, and gay ?</i>

1179
01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:42,594
对无人知晓的未来
<i>? Looking forward to who wouldn't do ?</i>

1180
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,090
和一切充满希翼

1181
01:18:42,677 --> 01:18:44,971
<i>? The role I was about to play ?</i>

1182
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:47,682
危难之际
<i>? But in my hour of need ?</i>

1183
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:50,435
我是真的 再次孤身一人 本就如此
<i>? I truly am, indeed ?</i>

1184
01:18:50,519 --> 01:18:54,439
<i>? Alone again, naturally ?</i>

1185
01:18:54,523 --> 01:19:00,654
投入我怀抱 当你孤单的时候
[men] <i>? Run to me whenever you're lonely ?</i>

1186
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:06,952
投入我怀抱 每当你需要依靠
<i>? Run to me if you need a shoulder ?</i>

1187
01:19:07,035 --> 01:19:13,625
某些时刻 你的他应该成熟而可靠
<i>? Now and then You need someone older ?</i>

1188
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:16,128
那么 宝贝 来到我的怀抱
<i>? So, darling ?</i>

1189
01:19:16,211 --> 01:19:19,756
遥远的彼岸
[woman] <i>? So far away ?</i>

1190
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:26,096
是否仍有人原地驻足
<i>? Doesn't anybody stay in one place Anymore? ?</i>

1191
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:33,520
看到你出现在门前 很幸福
<i>? It would be so fine To see your face at my door ?</i>

1192
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:35,814
却无从得知 你将时光虚度
<i>? Doesn't help to know ?</i>

1193
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:42,863
<i>? You're just far away ?</i>

1194
01:19:42,946 --> 01:19:45,240
我要回家了 明天见       回见 I’m going home. See you tomorrow.         See you later.
I gotta go home. See you tomorrow.

1195
01:19:45,323 --> 01:19:47,159
I'll see you later.

1196
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,932
我们快窒息了 勒克斯      你在这儿很安全
- [Mrs. Lisbon] I'm-I'm just perplexed. - [Lux] We're suffocating.

1197
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:56,460
我没法呼吸
- You're safe here. - I can't breathe in here.

1198
01:19:58,128 --> 01:19:59,629
没人接
No answer.

1199
01:19:59,713 --> 01:20:02,257
[motor whirring in distance]

1200
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:10,974
- [whirring continues] - [crushing sound]

1201
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:14,214
明天午夜 等我们的信号

1202
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:24,654
几点了?       到时候了
- [Tim] What time is it? - [Chase] Anytime now.

1203
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:27,699
伙计们 就在那儿       是吗?
- Guys, there it is. - What?

1204
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,246
是的 是她们
[Tim] Yeah, it's them.

1205
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:36,625
我们走
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1206
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:50,722
我有我妈的车钥匙
[whispering] I got the keys to my mom's car.

1207
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,607
- [clattering] - Shh!

1208
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,067
Shh.

1209
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:17,290
也许我们该敲敲门
[Tim] Maybe we should knock.

1210
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:19,125
Yeah.

1211
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:20,502
[knocking]

1212
01:21:23,505 --> 01:21:24,714
我们到了
We're here.

1213
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:31,805
[door opens]

1214
01:21:34,599 --> 01:21:36,601
到点了 我们在等你们呢
About time.

1215
01:21:36,685 --> 01:21:39,271
We've been waiting for you guys.

1216
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:42,899
我们有车 装满了油 想去哪儿都行
We got a car. We got a full tank of gas. We'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

1217
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:45,235
是辆美洲豹 车厢很大
It's just a Cougar, but it's got a pretty big trunk.

1218
01:21:46,278 --> 01:21:47,988
我能坐前排吗? 当然
Can I sit up front?

1219
01:21:49,197 --> 01:21:50,407
Sure.

1220
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:56,371
谁挨着我坐?
Which one of you is gonna sit up front next to me?

1221
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:59,416
你父母在哪儿?       睡觉
Where are your parents?

1222
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:01,626
你姐妹们呢? 马上就来
Asleep.

1223
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,545
What about your sisters?

1224
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:05,297
They're coming.

1225
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:08,592
快点 很晚了
Come on. It's getting late.

1226
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:13,305
再等5分钟
Wait five minutes. We had to wait until my parents were asleep.

1227
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:14,289
得等我父母都睡着

1228
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,807
得再等会儿 我妈失眠
They take forever.

1229
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,809
My mom's an insomniac.

1230
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:24,107
最好开我们的车 空间大些
We better take our car. There's more room.

1231
01:22:26,526 --> 01:22:28,528
你开得了旅行车吗?
Think you can handle a station wagon?

1232
01:22:29,696 --> 01:22:31,031
当然 又不是手动档 是吧?
Sure.

1233
01:22:31,114 --> 01:22:33,658
是的 没问题
- It's not a stick, is it? - No.

1234
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:35,243
Yeah, no problem.

1235
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:37,787
我能驾驶吗?       当然
Will you let me steer?

1236
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:38,872
我们得走了 我听到有动静 可以是你妈妈
Sure.

1237
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:41,499
But maybe we should get out of here. I just heard something.

1238
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:44,085
- It could be your mom. - Come on in.

1239
01:22:43,352 --> 01:22:46,185
进来吧

1240
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,432
我去车里等 I’ll go wait in the car.
I'll go wait in the car.

1241
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:59,434
你们在这儿等她们吧
You guys wait here for my sisters.

1242
01:23:17,494 --> 01:23:19,621
[Lux laughing]

1243
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:27,003
[humming]

1244
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,547
[laughing]

1245
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:33,385
[clattering]

1246
01:23:51,403 --> 01:23:53,697
[laughing quietly]

1247
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,991
- [clattering] - Oops. These girls make me crazy.

1248
01:23:55,491 --> 01:23:59,427
只要摸到一个 就能让我疯狂!

1249
01:23:57,075 --> 01:23:59,536
If I could just feel one of 'em up just once.

1250
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:04,708
怎么了?
What?

1251
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:12,799
[hissing sound]

1252
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,937
我们永远无法弄清发生的顺序
[narrator] <i>We would never be sure about the sequence of events.</i>

1253
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,939
到现在我们还在讨论
<i>We argue about it still.</i>

1254
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:35,029
很可能 邦妮死时
<i>Most likely Bonnie had died while we were waiting in the living room,</i>

1255
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,563
我们正在客厅里

1256
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:36,948
幻想着高速公路
<i>dreaming of highways.</i>

1257
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:41,161
随后玛丽把头伸进了烤箱里
<i>Mary put her head in the oven shortly thereafter.</i>

1258
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:46,207
特瑞丝吃了很多安眠药
<i>Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills, was gone by the time we got there.</i>

1259
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:48,209
在我们到之前就走了

1260
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:49,544
勒克斯是最后一个
<i>Lux was the last to go.</i>

1261
01:24:54,174 --> 01:24:55,175

1263
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:01,514
现在是周日下午四点钟
<i>It's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.</i>

1264
01:25:01,598 --> 01:25:03,641
你知道你的孩子在哪儿吗?
<i>Do you know where your children are?</i>

1265
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:08,646
邦妮 是里斯本姐妹中最小的一个...
<i>Bonnie, the youngest Lisbon sister, strangely wore a 1920s wedding dress.</i>

1266
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:12,358
特瑞丝・里斯本 她很爱马 曾经写信...
<i>Therese Lisbon, a horse lover, had written to the Brown University admissions office ―</i>

1267
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:15,653
玛丽想当啦啦队长
<i>Yeah, Mary always wanted to be a cheerleader, but her mother wouldn't let her,</i>

1268
01:25:15,737 --> 01:25:18,198
但她妈妈不同意
<i>so I was teaching her the cheers.</i>

1269
01:25:15,737 --> 01:25:18,103
在她们的家中自杀...

1270
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:19,407
我愤怒到无以复加
[overlapping voices]

1271
01:25:19,491 --> 01:25:21,117
...莉迪亚・皮尔 八频道新闻
<i>This has been Lydia Perl</i>

1272
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:23,203
<i>with Channel 8 news.</i>

1273
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:35,882
我的女儿们并不缺少爱
[Mrs. Lisbon] <i>None of my daughters lacked for any love.</i>

1274
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,094
我们家里有足够的爱
<i>There was plenty of love in our house.</i>

1275
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:44,057
我就是弄不懂为什么
<i>I never understood why.</i>

1276
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:01,074
[engine starts]

1277
01:26:16,256 --> 01:26:18,174
自杀事件后
[narrator] <i>After the suicide free-for-all,</i>

1278
01:26:18,258 --> 01:26:21,845
里斯本夫妇放弃了
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.</i>

1279
01:26:19,793 --> 01:26:24,171
过正常生活的愿望

1280
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:27,016
他们让海德力先生收拾了房子
<i>They had Mr. Headley pack up the house,</i>

1281
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,228
把能卖的家具都贱卖了
<i>selling what furniture he could in a garage sale.</i>

1282
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:37,110
里斯本先生把房子卖给一对波士顿年轻夫妇
<i>Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market, and it was sold to a young couple from Boston.</i>

1283
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:42,615
当然
<i>We, of course, took the family photos that were put out with the trash.</i>

1284
01:26:40,002 --> 01:26:45,793
我们从垃圾堆里拣来了家庭相册

1285
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,662
最终 我们拼凑出了谜团的答案
<i>In the end, we had pieces of the puzzle,</i>

1286
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:50,665
但裂痕仍在
<i>but no matter how we put them together, gaps remained.</i>

1287
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:55,086
形状奇怪的空白
<i>Oddly shaped emptiness mapped by what surrounded them.</i>

1288
01:26:52,965 --> 01:26:55,069
在环绕之物的映射下

1289
01:26:55,169 --> 01:26:57,171
就像叫不出名字的国度
<i>Like countries we couldn't name.</i>

1290
01:26:57,255 --> 01:26:59,591
[clock ticking]

1291
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:03,177
徘徊在她们身后的并非生命
<i>What lingered after them was not life...</i>

1292
01:27:04,512 --> 01:27:07,599
而是现实生活中最琐碎的物件
<i>but the most trivial list of mundane facts.</i>

1293
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:12,228
墙上滴答作响的钟摆
<i>A clock ticking on the wall.</i>

1294
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:16,107
正午昏暗的房间
<i>A room dim at noon.</i>

1295
01:27:17,525 --> 01:27:21,738
人类自私的暴行
<i>The outrageousness of a human being thinking only of herself.</i>

1296
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:26,767
自行其道

1297
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:30,204
我们开始徒劳的试图忘记她们
<i>We began the impossible process of trying to forget them.</i>

1298
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:32,290
[ticking continues]

1299
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,964
我们的父母做能的更好
<i>Our parents seemed better able to do this,</i>

1300
01:27:40,048 --> 01:27:42,967
他们回到网球组和鸡尾酒会上
<i>returning to their tennis foursomes and cocktail cruises</i>

1301
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:45,345
处变不惊
<i>as though they'd seen this all before.</i>

1302
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:49,766
盛夏又到来了
<i>It was full-fledged summer again,</i>

1303
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:53,144
在塞西利亚割腕一年后
<i>over a year from the time Cecilia had slit her wrists,</i>

1304
01:27:53,227 --> 01:27:55,229
空气中充满了毒药
<i>spreading the poison in the air.</i>

1305
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,858
疯长的植物增加了湖里的磷肥
<i>A spill at the plant increased the phosphates in the lake</i>

1306
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:03,279
并产生大量藻类
<i>and produced a scum of algae so thick that the swamp smell filled the air,</i>

1307
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,877
沼泽的气味

1308
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:05,573
环绕着这座气派的公馆
<i>infiltrating the genteel mansions.</i>

1309
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,911
少女们初登社会
<i>Debutantes cried over the misfortune of coming out in a season</i>

1310
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:12,497
每个人却只记得那时的恶臭
<i>everyone would remember for its bad smell.</i>

1311
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:16,417
而奥康纳家人的别出心裁
<i>The O'Connors, however, came up with the ingenious solution</i>

1312
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:19,587
给女儿爱丽丝的
<i>of making the theme of their daughter Alice's debutante party</i>

1313
01:28:19,671 --> 01:28:21,297
成人派对命名为"窒息"
<i>asphyxiation.</i>

1314
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:26,302
像大家一样
<i>Like everyone else, we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.</i>

1315
01:28:23,248 --> 01:28:27,728
我们渐渐忘了里斯本家的女孩

1316
01:28:27,762 --> 01:28:29,764
她会让他心脏病发的
[chattering, laughing]

1317
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:16,519
嗨 帕克
[chatters]

[retching]

1319
01:29:21,274 --> 01:29:23,735
会装死的虫子如何?
Al's got the, uh, acting bug.

1320
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,697
我从檎基抓来的
She caught it from Pinkie.

1321
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,993
我今晚想宣布
And I wanna announce tonight that next fall,

1322
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:35,455
下个秋天 爱丽丝就要去纽瀚文上学了
Alice is going to a little school in New Haven.

1323
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:41,461
我听说那里的语法学校十分了得
I hear they have a great drama school.

1324
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:44,380
事实上 就是萨姆的爸爸建的 是吧?
In fact, Sam, I think your father built it, didn't he?

1325
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:47,550
是医院 保罗
- [Sam] That's the law school. - [chuckling]

1326
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:50,636
我们十分为爱丽丝自豪 万分自豪
We're so proud of Alice. We really couldn't be prouder.

1327
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,639
这杯敬她
- [woman] Aw. Cheers. - [crowd] Cheers.

1328
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:01,689
我受够了 再见 残酷世界
I've had it.

1329
01:30:01,773 --> 01:30:04,025
Good-bye, cruel world.

1330
01:30:10,198 --> 01:30:13,034
不 不 不! 你不会理解我的
No, no, no. You don't understand me.

1331
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:15,453
我是少年 我有烦恼 I’m a teenager, l got problems.
I'm a teenager. I got problems.

1332
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:18,331
[laughter]

1333
01:30:26,798 --> 01:30:29,967
这些年来 有许多关于她们的流言蜚语
<i>So much has been said about the girls over the years...</i>

1334
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:33,930
但我们从未找到过答案
<i>but we have never found an answer.</i>

1335
01:30:36,974 --> 01:30:39,268
这与她们的早逝无关
<i>It didn't matter in the end how old they had been...</i>

1336
01:30:39,352 --> 01:30:41,604
[lighter flicking]

1337
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:43,523
抑或因为她们是女孩
<i>or that they were girls.</i>

1338
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:48,444
只因为我们爱过她们
<i>But only that we had loved them...</i>

1339
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:51,386
她们始终听不见

1340
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:51,697
<i>and that they hadn't heard us calling,</i>

1341
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:54,909
我们在门外的呐喊
<i>still do not hear us calling them out of those rooms...</i>

1342
01:30:56,077 --> 01:30:58,704
她们始终在那里孤独着
<i>where they went to be alone for all time...</i>

1343
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:04,210
我们永远无法将它们拼贴完整
<i>and where we will never find the pieces to put them back together.</i>
