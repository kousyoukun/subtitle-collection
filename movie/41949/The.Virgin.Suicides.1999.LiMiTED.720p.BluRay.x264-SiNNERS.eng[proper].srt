1
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,997
Cecilia was the first to go.

2
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:57,677
What are you doing here? You're not
old enough to know how bad life gets.

3
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,155
Obviously, doctor,
you've never been a 13-year-old girl.

4
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,526
Everyone dates
the demise of our neighborhood

5
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,060
from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.

6
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,497
People saw their clairvoyants
in the wiped out elms, the harsh sunlight,

7
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,866
and the continuing decline
of our auto industry.

8
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,497
Even then
we tried putting the pieces together.

9
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,940
We still can't.

10
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,741
Whenever we meet
at business lunches or cocktail parties

11
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,680
we go over the evidence one more time.

12
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,946
All to understand those five girls,

13
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,785
who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.

14
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,129
Cecilia, the youngest, was 1 2.

15
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,794
And Lux was 1 4.

16
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,032
Bonnie was 1 5.

17
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,402
Mary was 16.

18
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,711
And Therese was 1 7.

19
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,552
No one understood how Mr Lisbon,
our Math teacher,

20
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,190
had produced such beautiful creatures.

21
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:52,095
Paul Baldino said he found Cecilia
on her first attempt.

22
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,460
l was the one who found her.

23
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:59,799
l was in the sewers. Through those tunnels
you can get into anyone's house.

24
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,966
We believed him because
Paul's dad was Sammy the Shark Baldino

25
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,137
and his escape tunnel
led through the sewers.

26
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:12,911
So l wanted to see one
of those lesbian girls taking a shower.

27
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,178
Yeah, right.

28
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,154
And l walk in...
And l see blood everywhere!

29
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:22,159
So l turned around
and went right back out the tunnel.

30
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,533
l had to tell you guys that story.
See you guys later.

31
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,169
l heard it was an accident.

32
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,834
lt was no accident.
The parents are to blame.

33
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,740
l heard they found the razor in the toilet.

34
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,906
Everyone had opinions
why Cecilia tried to kill herself.

35
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,709
That girl didn't want to die,
she just wanted out of that house.

36
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,947
She wanted out of that decorating scheme.

37
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:59,729
The most popular theory
held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.

38
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,367
Dominic was an immigrant
who was staying with relatives

39
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,763
until his family got settled in New Mexico.

40
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,907
He was the first boy here
to wear sunglasses.

41
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,542
Within a week of arriving he'd fallen in love.

42
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,681
The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia,
but Diana Porter.

43
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,518
l love her!

44
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,887
When Diana Porter left on vacation,
Dominic denounced God.

45
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,930
And to prove his love, he jumped
off the roof of his relatives' house.

46
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,181
l'm going to show you some images.

47
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,759
And... er, you tell me

48
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,329
what they remind you of.

49
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,858
OK?

50
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,751
A banana.

51
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,419
A swamp.

52
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,239
An Afro.

53
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,253
l don't think that Cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

54
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,864
Her act was a cry for help.

55
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,767
l know you're very strict,

56
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,802
but l think that Cecilia would benefit

57
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:23,942
by having a social outlet
outside of the codification of school.

58
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,677
And interact with males her own age.

59
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:41,123
Peter helped Mr Lisbon install a model
of the solar system in his classroom.

60
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,092
ln return, Mr Lisbon invited him for dinner.

61
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,895
Bless us, O Lord, in these, Thy gifts

62
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,934
which we receive
from Thy bounty through Christ. Amen.

63
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,833
Amen.

64
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,305
- Lux, please put your shirt on this instant.
- Sorry.

65
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,345
- Thank you, dear.
- Can you pass the salt, please?

66
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,144
- Ham?
- Thank you.

67
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,654
- Sweetheart, would you like some peas?
- l hate peas.

68
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,487
lt's a nice-looking ham, dear.

69
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,296
- Well, thank you, honey.
- This is good, mum.

70
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,663
So, Peter, are you an aviation enthusiast?

71
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,771
Well, l don't know
if l'd call myself an enthusiast.

72
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,966
l like planes.

73
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,006
Peter, are you on the football squad?

74
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,617
No. l play, but l'm not on the team.

75
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,151
- Oh, l see.
- Not a team player.

76
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,915
Do you like to wrestle?

77
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,284
Are you OK?

78
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:52,658
A Brazilian frog entered
the endangered species list today.

79
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,728
- That's the third animal this year.
- Oh, dear. Darling, l've never heard of it.

80
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,534
- Excuse me. May l use the restroom?
- Of course.

81
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,702
The one down here isn't working.
Go upstairs through Cecilia's room.

82
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,472
OK, thanks.

83
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,709
Hold on.

84
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,116
l thought you'd died in there.

85
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,057
Are you done hogging the bathroom?
l need something.

86
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,260
Do you mind?

87
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,940
- Thank you.
- Are you forgetting something?

88
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,108
- Peter, here's an air foil...
- Thank you.

89
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:58,155
lt's a demonstration
of Bernoulli's Principle.

90
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,315
Lift...

91
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,756
From then on
the Lisbon house began to change.

92
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:14,500
Almost every day, and even when
she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,

93
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,768
Lux would suntan on her towel,
wearing a swimsuit

94
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:22,643
that caused the knife-sharpener to give her
a 1 5-minute demonstration for free.

95
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:30,179
Following the doctor's orders,
two weeks after Cecilia returned home

96
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:37,118
Mr Lisbon persuaded his wife to let the girls
throw the only party of their short lives.

97
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,204
There. ls that OK?

98
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,477
l've got to get dressed.

99
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,380
- Welcome.
- Good evening, Mrs Lisbon.

100
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,716
Come on in.

101
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,554
The party's in the basement.

102
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,969
Just go to the left
and then down the stairs.

103
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,776
Hi, l'm Bonnie.

104
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,355
- Hi... Tim.
- Nice to meet you.

105
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,459
- Would you like some punch?
- Yeah.

106
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,763
Thanks.

107
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,992
- Hi.
- Thanks.

108
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,265
- Hi.
- Thank you.

109
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,605
- Hey.
- Hi.

110
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,870
- Do you want to sit down?
- Yeah.

111
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:47,518
- How did your SATs go?
- OK.

112
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,684
Good.

113
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,497
Do you know
where you're applying yet?

114
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,102
No, but my parents
are pushing towards Yale.

115
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,468
- Because that's where my dad went.
- That's nice.

116
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,141
You have to imagine the clouds opening up

117
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,080
and out of the sun
would come the Hun in his Messerschmitt.

118
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:17,018
And boys, just older than you,
would be in this, the P51 B Mustang.

119
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,918
''B'' for bull's-eye.

120
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,027
- You've heard of Yale?
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,760
- This punch is fantastic.
- More?

122
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,198
What's in it?

123
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,970
Juices, some cherry... pineapple.

124
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,807
You know, l... l love pineapple.

125
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,981
Really?

126
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:56,659
This baby would come in.
This won the war for the United Kingdom.

127
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,992
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

128
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:07,905
And it's this kind of equipment
that makes a model work.

129
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,701
Here's Joe.

130
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,339
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

131
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,585
- lf he needs anything, call me.
- l'm sure he'll be fine.

132
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,386
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,720
Joe. Good to see you. How are you?

134
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,922
- Glad you came tonight.
- How's it going?

135
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,965
You're just in time.

136
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,103
Hi.

137
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,468
Look. His ears go
if you scratch his chin.

138
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,300
Joe, sing your song.

139
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,071
Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

140
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:53,174
Oh, the monkeys have no tails
They were bitten off by whales

141
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,254
Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

142
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,961
- Good song.
- Good job, Joe.

143
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,757
Where'd you learn that song?

144
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,995
Can l be excused?

145
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:15,506
lf you want to, my dear,
but this is your party.

146
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,306
All right. lf you want to go upstairs, do.
We'll just...

147
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,916
We'll just have to have fun without you.

148
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,349
Look. He always chooses heads.

149
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,784
- Joe, what's it going to be?
- Heads.

150
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,924
Joe, try tails.

151
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,621
Heads it is!

152
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,725
- Let's go.
- Heads.

153
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,834
Heads! One more time.

154
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,902
- ln the air, Joe.
- Heads.

155
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,540
Heads it is!

156
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,145
- One more time. Call in the air, Joe.
- Heads.

157
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,571
Heads. Not bad.

158
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,887
- How are you doing?
- Good.

159
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,719
- He picked it up really well.
- This is my favorite song.

160
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:11,386
You know, you're... very beautiful.
Like a saint.

161
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,360
l could paint you some time.

162
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,301
Thanks.

163
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,003
Did they sing it?

164
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,735
Wow, that's good!

165
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,079
God!

166
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,012
Oh, Lord!

167
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,187
Cecilia!

168
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,332
Oh, my...! No! No, no, no!

169
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,543
Don't look. Turn around.

170
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,737
Turn around! Darlings, turn... Oh, my God!

171
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,244
Oh, Jesus!

172
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,444
Please, God.

173
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,897
We're here now.

174
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,307
No funerals today.

175
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,508
He said she was only 1 2.

176
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,932
Hi, Mary. Are your parents home?

177
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,763
Hi, Father. Come in.

178
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,041
Oh. Hello, Father.

179
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,009
Please, sit down.

180
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,174
Thanks.

181
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,185
Come on, that was inside!

182
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,720
Uh, no. No, thanks.

183
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:39,395
How about we get the missus down here?
Have a little chat?

184
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,870
l'm afraid she's under the weather.

185
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,373
She's not...

186
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,704
seeing anybody.

187
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,215
Well, she'll see her priest.

188
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,818
This kid's a sucker
for the inside ones every time.

189
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,522
Every time.

190
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,716
Excuse me.

191
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,191
Father...

192
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,303
Double play, Father.

193
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,509
Double play.

194
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,392
Mrs Lisbon?

195
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,406
- May l come in?
- OK.

196
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,110
Hello, girls. l thought we could talk.

197
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,520
Do you feel like talking?

198
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,624
Well... if you ever want to,

199
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,319
you know where to find me.

200
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,571
Mrs Lisbon? lt's Father Moody.

201
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,948
Mrs Lisbon. Hello.

202
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:40,717
l wanted you to know
that l listed Cecilia's death as an accident.

203
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,065
An accident waiting to happen.

204
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:01,611
- They couldn't get a policy to cover it.
- lt's incredibly dangerous.

205
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,009
Let's give it a try.

206
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,386
Ready? One, two, three.

207
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:19,329
lt's so sad, l can't believe it happened.

208
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,557
Have you got that chain in your truck?

209
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,984
Hit it!

210
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,738
Our collection of souvenirs
of the Lisbon girls -

211
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:06,105
which still exists -
started with Cecilia's diary.

212
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:11,682
Parkie had gotten it from the plumber's
assistant, who'd found it in the bathroom.

213
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,580
Tim Weiner, the Brain, decoded it.

214
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,983
Emotional instability.

215
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:21,215
Look at the ''ls'', the dots on them.
They're everywhere.

216
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:25,825
Basically, what we have here is a dreamer.

217
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,591
Someone completely
out of touch with reality.

218
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,794
When she jumped,
she probably thought she would fly.

219
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,039
Monday, February 1 2th.
Today we had frozen pizza.

220
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:47,278
Thursday. Mum made cream corn
for dinner. lt's the worst. lt looks like...

221
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,488
Mary chipped a tooth acting like an idiot.

222
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,717
She made a scene
and had to get her tooth capped.

223
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,157
- lt looks normal.
- Give me that.

224
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,094
l said she had a capped tooth.

225
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:10,539
Elm trees! How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

226
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,478
Here's something about Dominic.

227
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:20,012
Palazzolo jumped off the roof today
over that rich bitch, Porter.

228
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,086
How stupid can you be?

229
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:28,718
Today we went out on the boat.
lt was cold. We saw a couple of whales.

230
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:32,330
Lux stroked the whale.
l didn't think they'd stink so much.

231
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,125
lt's the kelp in their bellies rotting.

232
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,564
l hope we can go again some time.

233
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,567
Let's read that.

234
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:44,175
Lux lusted over Kevin... ls it ''Heinz''?
The garbage man.

235
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,641
Lux lusted over Kevin Haines,
the garbage man.

236
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,715
She'd wake up at 5am
and hang out on the front steps.

237
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,045
Like it wasn't completely obvious!

238
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,847
She wrote his name
on all her underwear.

239
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,752
Mum found them
and bleached out all the Kevins.

240
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,723
Lux is crying on her bed all day.

241
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,662
''The trees, like lungs filling with air

242
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,172
''My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair''

243
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:26,013
And so we started to learn about their lives.

244
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,748
Coming to hold the memories
of times we hadn't experienced.

245
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,949
We felt the imprisonment of being a girl.

246
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,822
How it made your mind
active and dreamy.

247
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,726
And how you learnt
what colors went together.

248
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,333
We knew that the girls
were really women in disguise.

249
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,036
They understood love and even death.

250
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:49,662
Our job was to create the noise
that fascinated them.

251
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,704
They knew everything about us,
but we couldn't fathom them at all.

252
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,895
Hi. Mrs Lisbon, l'm Lydia Perl.
l'm putting together...

253
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,765
- Oh!
- Hi, l'm Bonnie. This is Mary.

254
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:24,204
Hello, girls. l'm here to ask you
a couple of questions...

255
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,468
about Cecilia.

256
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:31,145
- Yeah?
- Great. Um...

257
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,480
Maybe you could tell me
a little bit about her?

258
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,982
Did she have any special interests
or hobbies?

259
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,423
She liked writing her journal a lot.

260
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,223
That is great.

261
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,524
OK. Did she...

262
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,168
Did she ever talk about ending her life?

263
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,895
What's going on here?

264
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,336
You must be Mrs Lisbon.

265
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,237
l'm Lydia Perl.
l'm doing a piece for Channel Two.

266
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,777
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

267
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:08,878
The suicide of a teenager last summer
has increased the awareness of a crisis.

268
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,148
l'm at the home where Cecilia Lisbon...

269
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,488
Why don't they let her rest in peace?

270
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,155
..tragically put an end to her life.

271
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,696
Psychologists agree
that adolescence today

272
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:25,166
is more fraught by pressures
and complexities than in years past.

273
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:29,967
Doctors say that frustration
can lead to acts of violence

274
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:35,705
whose reality the adolescent
cannot separate from its intended drama.

275
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,006
l baked a pie full of rat poison.

276
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:43,747
l thought l could eat it
without it being suspicious.

277
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:49,152
My nana, who was 86...

278
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,162
She really likes sweets.

279
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,263
She had three pieces.

280
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,844
l'm sorriest for the mother.

281
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:10,379
You'd always wonder
what you could have done.

282
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,074
- l gotta go. See you later.
- All right. Bye-bye.

283
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,152
Bye-bye.

284
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,577
Don't worry.

285
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,515
They took the fence out.

286
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,068
God, you snore loud.

287
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,614
Those girls have a bright future ahead.

288
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:37,193
The other one
was just going to end up a cook.

289
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:42,162
We didn't see the girls together
as a group until September 7th.

290
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,861
Mary, Lux, Bonnie and Therese,

291
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,904
came to school
as though nothing had happened.

292
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:54,979
We felt if we looked hard, we'd understand
their feelings and who they were.

293
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:59,515
All right. These are Venn diagrams,
as you remember.

294
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:05,554
lf we have ''A'' and ''B'' intersecting.
And ''A'' and ''B''.

295
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:09,216
lf ''A'' intersects ''B'', we have this area.

296
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:14,364
And if ''A'' is the union with ''B'', we have
all of the circle plus the intersection.

297
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:20,527
These are the laws
of intersection and union. OK?

298
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,045
How's it going?

299
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,048
Not bad.

300
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:44,591
OK. ''Do a character sketch on the following
characters from Portrait Of A Lady...''

301
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,731
The first one is... Ralph.

302
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,197
Um... He was nice.

303
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,065
lt was really sad when he died.

304
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,907
Oh, my gosh. l can't believe l just said that.

305
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,375
l am so sorry.

306
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,226
Reading about the alarming suicide rate,

307
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:20,956
l talked to Mr Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here

308
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:26,365
and realized that nothing about this serious
matter has been discussed at this school.

309
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,734
And quickly thereafter
green pamphlets were distributed.

310
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:33,639
We felt green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.

311
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,370
Certainly better than red.

312
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:41,916
The pamphlets said there were 80 suicides
a day in America - 30,000 a year.

313
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,349
Cheese!

314
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,113
lt alerted us to danger signals
we couldn't help but look for.

315
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,953
Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?

316
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:53,564
Had they lost interest in school activities
and sports and hobbies?

317
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,098
Had they withdrawn from their peers?

318
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,962
Hi, l'm Chase.

319
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,741
l know who you are.

320
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,336
l've only been going to this school
my whole life.

321
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,947
You don't have to talk to me.

322
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:25,226
So, we have two different types
of economics.

323
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:30,891
Of these different types
the first one is called macroeconomics.

324
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,502
Look.

325
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,968
She's laughing.

326
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:40,938
He made her laugh. You never heard
him say anything remotely intelligent!

327
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:48,279
The boys who talked with Lux were always
stupid and terrible sources of information.

328
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,954
..squeezebox. She's all right.

329
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,319
Let me tell you,
she's the hottest girl in school.

330
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:58,292
You want to know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

331
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,294
No, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

332
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,491
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what l mean.

333
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:11,006
The only reliable boy who got to know Lux
was Trip Fontaine.

334
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:18,105
Who had recently lost his baby fat
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

335
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,785
l'm late again.

336
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:27,187
Oh, come on!

337
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,999
Thank you.

338
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:51,508
All the girls at our school
are in love with Trip.

339
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,907
All the girls, except Lux.

340
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,141
Trip said his passion for Lux began
when he went into the wrong History class.

341
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,287
As was his custom,
he went out to smoke the marijuana

342
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:10,291
he took as regularly
as a diabetic kid takes lnsulin.

343
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:20,971
On this particular day, he avoided
Mr Woodhouse by ducking into a class.

344
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,715
She was the still point of the turning world.

345
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,091
l never got over that girl. Never.

346
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:50,062
l've loved a lot of ladies, but not like that...
That was real.

347
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,965
l'll never forget the first time l saw her.

348
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:58,836
l didn't know what had hit me.
l didn't know what to do.

349
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:05,307
Because it was so easy with all
the other girls, but she wouldn't look at me.

350
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:10,352
l... l was never the kind to pursue.
lf you know what l mean.

351
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,959
That girl drove me crazy, man.

352
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,104
Mmm, yummy.

353
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,611
Lux?

354
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,748
Hey.

355
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,615
Look at it. lt's just meat on bread rolls.

356
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,853
Thanks, Mum.

357
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,029
Trip's dad was little help.

358
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:07,105
Well, first off, don't call her on the phone.

359
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,111
lt's all... lt's all subtlety.

360
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,340
lt's all nuance.

361
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,509
Yeah. You just need to talk to her at school.

362
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,919
About anything. About the weather,
or... school assignments.

363
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:26,155
Anything for the chance to communicate
with the language of eye contact.

364
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,532
And project confidence.

365
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,461
And keep the hair out of your eyes.

366
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,970
Feel the vibe.

367
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,147
- Just do your stuff.
- Yeah.

368
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,823
The word ''hurricane'' was the name given
to Nature's strongest storm.

369
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,824
A hurricane occurs when high-pressure

370
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:02,295
and low-pressure masses of air
come into contact with one another.

371
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:06,733
There is often a significant difference
in temperature between the two masses.

372
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:12,202
One mass is warm, while the other is cold.

373
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:17,042
The warmer air rises
and the cooler air falls.

374
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:23,016
Likewise, the low-pressure area slides
down the sides of the high-pressure area.

375
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,519
They swirl around one another,

376
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,716
creating the beginnings of the storm.

377
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,793
With this footage, taken from US Navy
weather patrol aircraft,

378
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:41,701
we can observe the high and low-pressure
masses coming in contact with each other.

379
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,173
The result is a surging storm
of tremendous strength

380
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:51,213
that strikes with forceful determination.

381
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:02,292
Even though the hurricane
is the most powerful storm known to us

382
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:07,297
it strikes large land areas
such as continents or large islands.

383
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,329
and slowly dies.

384
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:13,197
Mr Montgomery, his ass is grass.

385
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,038
l want to ask you out.

386
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,406
Fat chance.

387
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,914
First, l'll go over to your house
and watch the tube.

388
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,422
And then l'm gonna ask you out.

389
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,670
You're the stone fox.

390
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:53,010
The hurricane. One of the most awesome
and spectacular stories Nature has to offer.

391
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,616
- What channel is this?
- Five.

392
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,982
Oh. Let's see...

393
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:11,390
''Animals ln The Wild.
Journey through the African Kalahari

394
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,598
''and see animals in their natural habitat.''

395
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,395
l think that sounds nice, don't you?

396
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:23,835
This huge rainforest eventually
gives way to grasslands

397
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,740
that stretch to the horizon
in all directions - this is the Kalahari.

398
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:34,711
- Do you want some more pop?
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.

399
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,951
Thanks.

400
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:50,857
The wildlife spectacle
played out on these grasslands,

401
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:55,665
and in recesses of the rainforest,
is unparalleled anywhere on Earth.

402
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,380
Lux, put your feet down, honey.

403
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:17,751
The Kalahari and its vast open sky provide
a theatre for the life and death drama

404
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:21,626
played out by the herds

405
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:25,131
and the great
hunting cats that play on them.

406
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,168
Oh, my!

407
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,205
lt's getting so late. Honey...?

408
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:38,982
- l said it's getting late.
- Oh. Well, let's hit the TV button.

409
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,287
Right. Er...

410
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,552
- OK.
- Thank you.

411
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,195
- lt was nice to meet you Mrs Lisbon.
- Yes.

412
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,990
- Good night.
- See you.

413
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,023
Bye.

414
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,556
Goodbye.

415
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,924
l've got to get back.

416
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:06,260
This is fourth period,
l don't have you until fifth, do l?

417
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:09,331
l know. l'm not here for math today, sir.

418
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:17,697
l'm here to tell you that my intentions
for your daughter are entirely honorable.

419
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:25,676
- What might those intentions be?
- To ask Lux to the Homecoming Dance.

420
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:31,348
Trip, why don't you sit down for a minute?

421
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:38,821
You see, my wife and l have certain rules.

422
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:44,060
They were the rules for the older girls.
l can't change them for the younger ones.

423
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:47,671
Even if l wanted to,
the wife wouldn't let me.

424
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:53,435
So, if you want to come over and watch
television again, that would be fine.

425
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:57,672
But you cannot take Lux out.
Especially not in a car.

426
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:01,443
So l'm sorry, son, that's just our policy.

427
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:09,853
OK, sir. What if a bunch of us guys
took all your daughters out in a group

428
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,121
and had them back by the time you said?

429
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,755
- Are you on the football squad, son?
- Yes, sir.

430
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,869
- What position?
- Defence quarterback.

431
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,938
Ah, good.

432
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:25,473
l was a... l was a safety in my day.

433
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,907
Well, that's a crucial position, sir.

434
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,945
- Nothing between you and the goal line.
- Exactly!

435
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,882
- Oh, well.
- So the thing is, sir.

436
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:39,955
We've got the big game
and then afterwards we've got the dance.

437
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:42,558
All the other guys are taking dates.

438
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,526
You're good-looking.
Lots of girls would go with you.

439
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,891
l'm not interested in lots of girls, sir.

440
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:01,567
l'll take it up with the wife, Trip.
Do what l can.

441
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:04,777
Thank you, sir.

442
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,785
- lt's a craft.
- Oh.

443
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:22,532
Trip Fontaine and some of the boys
in the football squad

444
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,965
have asked to take the girls
to the Homecoming Dance.

445
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,696
You know how l feel
about that sort of thing.

446
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,864
- l'm a chaperone at the dance.
- Oh, please!

447
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:37,479
Your father and l will discuss it later.

448
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,114
Mr Fontaine, may l speak with you, please?

449
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,083
My wife and l have come to a decision
about your request...

450
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,304
Yes!

451
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,244
l'm taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

452
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,076
l need three guys to take the other girls.

453
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:26,162
- l'll give you three joints, Trip.
- Pick me. We can take my dad's Caddy.

454
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,525
You gotta pick me, Tripster.

455
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,896
Trip, man. You owe me.

456
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,561
l saved your ass with Woodhouse that time.

457
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,969
- Thanks, Dad.
- Who are the other boys?

458
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:43,876
Let's see. Parker Denton, Jake Conley -
he's a good student, dear -

459
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,976
and Kevin Head.

460
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:51,611
- Who's taking who?
- They're going to raffle us off.

461
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:57,491
lt didn't make any difference
which dress the girls chose.

462
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,927
Mrs Lisbon added an inch to the bust line
and two to the waist and hems.

463
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:05,627
The dresses became four identical sacks.

464
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,737
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah.

465
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,241
OK. Come on.

466
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,575
Oh, l'm sorry. Here we go.

467
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,045
Come on. Together.

468
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,308
And cheddar cheese.

469
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,119
Oh, it's so exciting!

470
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:52,178
- Are we ready?
- Ready, man.

471
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,817
Let's do it.

472
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,581
ln the end Parkie won
because of the Cadillac,

473
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,557
Kevin Head,
because he had the killer weed,

474
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,720
and Joe Hill Conley
because he won all the school prizes -

475
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,731
which Trip thought
would impress Mr and Mrs Lisbon.

476
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,934
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Mrs Lisbon.

477
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,734
- Come in.
- Thank you.

478
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,049
- Who's driving?
- l am.

479
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:40,390
- How long have you had your license?
- Two months. l was a learner for a year.

480
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,192
The girls almost never go out in cars.

481
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:49,202
- There's so many accidents. Be careful.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

482
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,000
OK. The third degree's over.

483
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,534
Girls!

484
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,746
- l'd better go. See you at the dance.
- See you there, Mr Lisbon.

485
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,812
Bye, dear.

486
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,190
Girls. Come on down.

487
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,728
The boys are here.

488
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:43,155
We got white ones.
We didn't know what you were wearing

489
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:48,287
and the flower guy said
that white would go with anything.

490
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,959
l'm glad you got white.

491
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:55,501
Why don't you pin them on?

492
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:26,027
- There we go.
- All right, let's do it.

493
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,635
Great.

494
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:30,136
Bye, Mum.

495
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,251
Oh, gosh, look! The car's there again!

496
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:48,550
l'm sure Mr Lea's having an affair with
her. He followed her into the laundry room.

497
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:53,059
- He's so sad with that red nose.
- Probably an alcoholic.

498
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,064
- The Hesses are Nazis.
- They're Nazi sympathizers.

499
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:01,466
They had a fit when Miss Schwartz
tried to join the tennis club.

500
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:05,802
Nice aluminum siding!
Do they really think that looks OK?

501
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:11,503
- Mr Peters ordered that from TV.
- lt's a Baldinos barbecue tree stump.

502
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,480
l have never seen a barbecue on that thing!

503
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:17,711
Actually, it's an escape tunnel
for the Shark.

504
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:20,356
lt leads to the river and his speedboat.

505
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:25,186
Paul often goes there. He can get into
anyone's basement through the sewers.

506
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,421
- No way!
- Yeah.

507
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:46,677
- Dad'll smell it on you.
- No, l got mints.

508
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:51,253
- He'll smell it on your clothes.
- l'll say they were smoking in the toilets.

509
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:57,157
- Don't let it die a virgin.
- That's gross.

510
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,887
Yeah, grow up, Conley.

511
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:58,448
- Do you want to dance?
- Sure.

512
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,190
Dance?

513
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:27,773
We've been having such lovely weather,
don't you think?

514
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,920
Yeah, we have... Nice.

515
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:42,823
Good evening.
Could l have your attention for a moment?

516
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:46,491
l hope you're having a good time.
lt sure looks like it.

517
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,766
The dance committee
really outdid themselves this time.

518
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,967
l'd like to open the voting
for Homecoming King and Queen.

519
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:58,909
The ballot box is over there,
so please vote.

520
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:03,178
And we'll make the announcement
in a little while. Thank you.

521
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:09,089
- Did anybody see you come in?
- No.

522
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,750
- What about you?
- No.

523
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,534
You'll love it.

524
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:26,474
Peach schnapps.

525
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:29,175
Babes love it.

526
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:48,053
That stuff tastes really good.

527
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,900
l don't want any, thanks.

528
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:55,037
Go on, just a taste. A tiny taste.

529
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,969
Don't be such a goody-goody.

530
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:04,672
Don't swallow it.

531
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,559
Can l have everyone's attention?

532
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:03,535
l'd like you to put your hands together
for this year's Kind and Queen...

533
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,474
Trip Fontaine and Lux Lisbon.

534
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,857
l'm having the best time!

535
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,512
Let's go for a walk.

536
01:00:56,686 --> 01:01:00,918
l'd better not.
l've got to go back in a minute.

537
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:05,118
We can keep an eye on the car.
They won't leave without us.

538
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,627
My dad...

539
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:12,131
Tell him you're putting the crown
in your locker.

540
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,534
- See that divot there?
- Uh-huh?

541
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:19,004
That's where l reamed this guy today.

542
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,700
- A cross body-block.
- Really?

543
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:28,817
- Maybe they went home with your dad?
- l doubt it.

544
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,717
- We're cooked.
- Luxy is, we're not.

545
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,109
Does anyone have any mints?

546
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,711
- Sorry.
- No.

547
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,281
Bye, Parkie.

548
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:08,716
- We'll walk you to the door.
- No, don't.

549
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:13,192
- Why not?
- Just don't.

550
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:16,764
OK.

551
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,926
Will you call me?

552
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,003
Absolutely!

553
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,109
Bye.

554
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:31,111
- Bye.
- Bye.

555
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:11,872
- Are you OK?
- Where have you been?

556
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:17,001
Look at the state of you!
Get in the house!

557
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:32,318
l walked home alone that night. l didn't care
how she got home. lt was weird.

558
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:37,626
l mean, l liked her. l liked her a lot.
But out there on the field...

559
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,131
lt was just different then.

560
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,942
That was the last time l saw her.

561
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,907
You know, most people
will never taste that kind of love.

562
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:58,053
But at least l tasted it once, right?

563
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:06,088
lt's time for your six o'clock group meeting.

564
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:25,611
Given Lux's failure to make curfew,
everyone expected a crackdown.

565
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:30,877
But few anticipated it would be so drastic.

566
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,714
The girls were taken out of school
and Mrs Lisbon shut the house

567
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:38,417
in maximum-security isolation.

568
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:42,421
She did more than taking the girls
out of school.

569
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,658
That Sunday,
after a spirited church sermon.

570
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:49,168
Mrs Lisbon made Lux destroy her records.

571
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:50,771
Now!

572
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,907
But, Mum...

573
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,533
This is final, Luxy.

574
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:58,909
- That's not fair.
- l said now.

575
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,765
Now, Luxy!

576
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,815
Come on.

577
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,850
Kiss. Please don't make me do this.

578
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,924
Burn it.

579
01:07:56,305 --> 01:08:00,571
Oh, Mum, Aerosmith! Come on,
please don't make me burn this.

580
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:02,745
Please...

581
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,312
What's that smell?

582
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:11,278
All right, that'll do for now.
Give me these... Give me these.

583
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,785
l'll put them in the trash.

584
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:56,129
This was when we began seeing Lux
making love on the roof with random men.

585
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:59,632
- ls she naked?
- You can't tell.

586
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,100
Get it focused.

587
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,763
- Will you stop? Wait your turn.
- What are they doing?

588
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,375
They're rolling around up there.

589
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:14,272
Hold on. She's on him.
He's rubbing his hands through her hair.

590
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,284
- Let me look.
- No. No, it's my telescope, Chase.

591
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:25,122
- Yes and what else?
- That man's in a burger chalet uniform.

592
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,921
Let me see.

593
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:32,394
Yeah. You never think
that those guys ever get lucky.

594
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:36,003
Then she asks me
if what we'd just done was dirty.

595
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,571
l knew what to say. l said no.

596
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,574
Then she goes,
''You like me, don't you?''

597
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:45,510
l didn't say anything.
lt's best to keep chicks guessing.

598
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:50,118
Chase, honey.
Come practice your violin before dinner.

599
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:56,515
You're not going to believe it.
Lux is on the roof again tonight!

600
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:00,150
- Her hands are moving down.
- l gotta see this.

601
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,823
- This is beautiful.
- Now she's on top of him.

602
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:08,168
- What's she doing, man?
- Wait.

603
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:11,171
Now they're done. He's getting up.

604
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:16,702
- That's it?
- That was quick.

605
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:30,455
...plus one. And if the exponential is time,
then you'd have as you approach...

606
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:36,963
Oh, good morning. Have we
photosynthesized our breakfast today?

607
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:51,411
- Hello, Ronald.
- Hi, Harry.

608
01:10:52,682 --> 01:10:55,879
Your daughters haven't been at school
for over two weeks.

609
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,714
Have you checked out back?

610
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,425
They've found a new Math teacher.

611
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:11,191
- He'll have to get another job.
- l know.

612
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:17,529
How long can those girls
be cooped up like that?

613
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:38,254
Go away. This is our tree.

614
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:43,331
Girls, girls...
lt's a little late. This tree is dead.

615
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:47,059
- Why don't you leave it up to Nature?
- lf we did, there'd be no trees left.

616
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,898
That's what it's going to be like anyway.

617
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:53,508
lf they didn't bring the fungus from Europe,
this wouldn't have happened.

618
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,110
OK. Let's go.

619
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,212
No?

620
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:03,478
That's it. l have an order
to cut down your elm tree,

621
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,951
but your kids won't let us.

622
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:11,287
- How do you know it's sick.
- Believe me, it's dead for Christsake.

623
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:15,363
- Arbotect is a less aggressive therapy.
- lt doesn't work.

624
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:20,331
- l leave that tree there, they'll all go.
- They could anyway.

625
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,731
Look, l don't want to call the police.

626
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:27,842
Our daughters are standing on our lawn.
Since when is that a crime?

627
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:47,318
Clive. See those girls in their nighties?
That's the shot that l want.

628
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:52,331
Honey, you'll have to move forward.
l want those girls in their nighties.

629
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:56,596
- Let's back up.
- Give me some more slack.

630
01:12:56,806 --> 01:13:00,503
- There you go. ls that good?
- Great.

631
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:02,769
Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon,

632
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:08,110
the teenager whose suicide last summer
focused awareness on a national problem,

633
01:13:08,284 --> 01:13:14,223
put their own lives in jeopardy by trying to
protect the elm that Cecilia so dearly loved.

634
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:07,275
The circles under your eyes come out
when it's overcast, so you need to wear...

635
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:12,106
For the next few weeks
we hardly saw the girls at all.

636
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,079
Joe didn't call Therese as he had promised.

637
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:24,692
And Lux never spoke to Trip again.

638
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:29,122
You're the stone fox.

639
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:38,529
The girls' only contact with the world
was through the catalogues they ordered.

640
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:42,837
lt filled their mailbox
with pictures of high-end fashions

641
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:45,947
and brochures for exotic vacations.

642
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:52,181
Unable to go anywhere, they travelled
in their imaginations to Siamese temples,

643
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:58,122
or past an old man with a leaf broom
tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

644
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:06,124
We ordered the same catalogues and hiked
through dusty passes with the girls.

645
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:11,302
Stopping every now and then
to help them with their backpacks.

646
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,567
Placing our hands on their warm,
moist shoulders,

647
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:18,509
and gazing off at the fire sunsets.

648
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:22,148
We drank tea with them in a water pavilion.

649
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:25,279
We did whatever we wanted.

650
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:30,091
Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

651
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:38,125
The only way we felt close to the girls
was through these impossible excursions

652
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,632
which have scared us forever,

653
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:44,636
making us happier with dreams than wives.

654
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:51,268
Collecting everything we could of theirs,
the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds,

655
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,778
but they were slipping away.

656
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:58,977
The colors of their eyes faded along with
the exact location of their dimples.

657
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:03,750
From five they had become four,
and they were all living in the dead...

658
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,692
becoming shadows.

659
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:10,161
We were losing them
when the girls contacted us.

660
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:14,462
One long. Two short.

661
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,772
One long. Have you got that?

662
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:21,204
- That's it.
- OK.

663
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,610
Help.

664
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:27,146
Send.

665
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:31,714
Bo... Bo.

666
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:38,083
- Bobo?
- Bobo. That's it... Bobo.

667
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,856
''Help. Send Bobo.''
l thought you knew Morse code!

668
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,524
There's something here for you.

669
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,330
l got one, too.

670
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:28,574
We racked our brains
for a way of contacting them.

671
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:32,874
Tom suggested we fly a kite
with a message alongside the house.

672
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:35,539
But that had logistical problems.

673
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:41,179
ln the end, the answer was simple -
we called them on the telephone.

674
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:44,521
727 8221 .

675
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,525
Get ready.

676
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:54,424
- Hello?
- Go!

677
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,777
Call us. 727 0487.

678
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,051
Shit. lt's them.

679
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:34,769
- l'm going home. See you tomorrow.
- See you later.

680
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:41,202
- We're suffocating.
- Lux, you're safe here.

681
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,104
l can't breathe.

682
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,175
No answer.

683
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:13,303
- What time is it?
- Any time now.

684
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:16,376
- Guys, there it is.
- What?

685
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,909
Yeah, it's them.

686
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,347
Let's go.

687
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:39,531
l've got the keys to my mum's car.

688
01:21:02,925 --> 01:21:05,189
Maybe we should knock.

689
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:13,934
We're here.

690
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:27,174
lt's about time.
We've been waiting for you guys.

691
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:30,807
We've got a car.
We'll take you anywhere you want to go.

692
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:33,147
lt's a Cougar. lt's got a big trunk.

693
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:38,317
- Can l sit up front?
- Sure.

694
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:44,190
Which one of you
is going to sit next to me?

695
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:49,661
- Where are your parents?
- Asleep.

696
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:53,137
- What about your sisters?
- They're coming.

697
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,476
Come on. lt's late.

698
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:02,077
Wait five minutes. We have to wait
until my parents are asleep.

699
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:06,585
They take forever.
My mum's an insomniac.

700
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:13,558
We'd better take our car,
there's more room.

701
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:20,365
- Think you can handle a station wagon?
- Sure. lt's not a stick, is it?

702
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:23,129
- No.
- Yeah, no problem.

703
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,763
- Will you let me steer?
- Sure.

704
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,400
We should go. l just heard something.
lt could be your mum.

705
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,146
Come on in.

706
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:47,389
l'll go wait in the car.
You guys wait here for my sisters.

707
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:47,388
These girls make me crazy.
lf l just felt one of them once!

708
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,957
What?

709
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,206
We would never be sure about
the sequence of events.

710
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:16,474
We argue about it still.

711
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:23,317
Most likely, Bonnie had died
while we were waiting in the living room

712
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:26,085
dreaming of highways.

713
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:30,027
Mary put her head in the oven
shortly thereafter.

714
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:34,794
Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills,
was gone by the time we got there.

715
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:38,639
Lux was the last to go.

716
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:51,513
lt's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
Do you know where your children are?

717
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:55,315
Bonnie, the younger Lisbon sister...

718
01:24:55,524 --> 01:25:00,188
Therese Lisbon,
a horse-lover, has written to...

719
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:03,523
Mary wanted to be a cheerleader,
but her mother wouldn't let her.

720
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:06,064
..suicide in their house...

721
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:11,069
- l wasn't able to express the anger l felt.
- ..Lydia Perl, Channel Eight News.

722
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:24,217
None of my daughters lacked for any love.

723
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:28,548
There was plenty of love in our house.

724
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:32,485
l never understood why.

725
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:09,391
After the suicides, Mr and Mrs Lisbon
gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.

726
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:14,863
They had Mr Hadley pack up the house,

727
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:18,096
and sell the furniture in a garage sale.

728
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:24,705
Mr Lisbon sold the house
to a young couple from Boston.

729
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:32,281
We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.

730
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:38,556
ln the end, we had pieces of the puzzle,
but gaps still remained.

731
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:42,857
Oddly-shaped emptiness,
mapped by what surrounded them,

732
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,727
like countries we couldn't name.

733
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,338
What lingered after them was not life,

734
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:56,274
but the most trivial list of mundane facts -

735
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,776
a clock ticking on the wall,

736
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:04,182
a room dim at noon,

737
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:10,152
the outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.

738
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:19,496
We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.

739
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:27,970
Our parents were able to do this,

740
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:34,980
returning to their tennis foursomes and
cocktails as though they'd seen it all before.

741
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:37,618
lt was full-fledged summer again -

742
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:42,916
over a year after Cecilia had slit her
wrists spreading the poison in the air.

743
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:47,687
A spill at the plant increased the lake's
phosphates and produced algae

744
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:53,630
so that the swamp's smell filled the air
infiltrating the genteel mansions.

745
01:27:54,903 --> 01:28:00,102
Debutantes cried at coming out
in a season remembered for its bad smell.

746
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:04,710
The O'Connors ingeniously made

747
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:10,181
the theme of their daughter Alice's
debutante party ''Asphyxiation''.

748
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:15,515
Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.

749
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:18,454
She'll give him a heart attack.

750
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:04,897
Hi, Parkie.

751
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:13,069
How about the acting bug?

752
01:29:13,248 --> 01:29:15,546
l caught it from Kinky.

753
01:29:16,885 --> 01:29:22,983
And l want to announce tonight that next fall
Alice is going to school in Newhaven.

754
01:29:26,061 --> 01:29:29,519
l hear they have
a great grammar school up there.

755
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,496
ln fact, Sam's father built it, didn't he?

756
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:35,397
The hospital, Paul.

757
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:39,198
We're so proud of Alice.
We couldn't be prouder.

758
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,934
Here's to her.

759
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:51,281
l've had it. Goodbye cruel world.

760
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:03,325
No, no, no! You don't understand me.
l'm a teenager, l got problems.

761
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:19,611
So much has been said
about the girls over the years,

762
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:22,909
but we have never found an answer.

763
01:30:24,953 --> 01:30:28,582
lt didn't matter how old they had been,

764
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:32,191
or that they were girls,

765
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:37,393
but only that we had loved them.

766
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:42,298
And that they still do not hear us
calling them out of those rooms

767
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:47,305
where they went to be alone for all time.

768
01:30:48,343 --> 01:30:52,143
We will never find the pieces
to put them back together.

769
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:41,228
