1
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,314
Cecilia was the first to go.

2
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,480
What are you doing here, honey?

3
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,816
You're not even old enough
to know how bad life gets.

4
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,653
Obviously, Doctor,
you've never been a 13-year-old girl.

5
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:39,813
Everyone dates
the demise of our neighbourhood...

6
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:42,524
...from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.

7
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:47,779
People saw their clairvoyance in
the wiped-out elms, the harsh sunlight...

8
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:51,199
...and the continuing decline
of our auto industry.

9
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:55,578
Even then, as teenagers,
we tried to put the pieces together.

10
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,330
We still can't.

11
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,583
Now whenever we run into each other
at lunches or parties...

12
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,961
...we find ourselves going over
the evidence one more time.

13
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:08,256
All to understand those five girls,...

14
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:12,134
...who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.

15
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:16,931
Cecilia, the youngest, was 13.

16
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,644
And Lux was 14.

17
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,357
Bonnie was 15.

18
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,026
Mary was 16.

19
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,156
And Therese was 17.

20
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,120
No one could understand how Mrs. Lisbon
and Mr. Lisbon, our math teacher,...

21
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:44,998
...had produced such beautiful creatures.

22
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,504
Paul Baldino claimed to have
found Cecilia on her first attempt.

23
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:54,215
Hey, I was the one who found her.

24
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:58,260
I was in the storm sewer under my house.
There's all these tunnels.

25
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:00,512
You could get into anyone's house.

26
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:02,681
When Paul said this, we believed him...

27
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,809
...because he was the son
of Sammy "the Shark" Baldino,...

28
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,394
...and we knew about his escape tunnel.

29
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:12,190
So I went up, thinking I could see
one of those girls taking a shower!

30
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:13,816
Right!

31
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,693
And I walk in...

32
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,736
...and I see blood everywhere.

33
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:21,907
So I turned around, went for the stairs
and right back out the tunnel.

34
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:25,160
I had to tell you guys that story.

35
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,787
I'll see you guys later, all right?

36
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:34,293
- I heard there was an accident.
- It was no accident, Joan.

37
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:37,004
Of course the parents are to blame!

38
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:39,715
I heard they found the razor in the toilet...

39
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:43,385
Everyone had an opinion
as to why Cecilia had tried to kill herself.

40
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,597
That girl didn't want to die.
She just wanted out of that house.

41
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,391
She wanted out
of that decorating scheme.

42
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,023
The most popular theory
held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.

43
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,570
Dominic was staying with relatives
until his family got settled in New Mexico.

44
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:06,906
He was the first in our neighbourhood
to wear sunglasses,...

45
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,826
...and within a week of his arrival
he'd fallen in love.

46
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:14,914
The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia,
but Diana Porter.

47
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,837
I love her!

48
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:26,174
When Diana Porter left on vacation
in Switzerland, Dominic denounced God.

49
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,969
To prove the validity of his love...

50
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,431
...he jumped off the roof
of his relatives' house.

51
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,579
Ahem! I'm gonna
show you some images,...

52
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:02,124
...and, uh... you tell me...

53
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,795
...what they remind you of.

54
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,298
OK?

55
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:28,648
A banana.

56
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:36,322
A swamp.

57
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,290
An Afro.

58
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:08,351
I don't think Cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

59
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:12,438
Her act was a cry for help.

60
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,316
I know you're very strict,...

61
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:20,237
...but I think that Cecilia would benefit
by having a social outlet...

62
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,198
...outside of the codification of school,...

63
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:28,161
...where she could interact
with males her own age.

64
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:40,547
Peter Sisten had helped Mr. Lisbon install
a model of the solar system in his class.

65
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,675
And in return Mr. Lisbon
invited him for dinner.

66
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:46,261
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts,...

67
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:50,264
...which we are about to receive from thy
bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

68
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,141
Amen.

69
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:54,810
Lux, please, put your shirt on this instant.

70
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:57,521
Sorry.

71
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:03,485
- Thank you, dear.
- Can you pass the salt, please?

72
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:06,446
- Ham?
- Thank you.

73
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,532
- Sweetheart, would you like some peas?
- I hate peas.

74
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,617
Here.

75
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,203
That's a nice-looking ham, dear.

76
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:19,333
- Well, thank you, honey.
- Mm, this is good.

77
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,544
So, Peter, are you an aviation enthusiast?

78
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:27,799
Well, I don't know if I'd call myself
an enthusiast, but I like planes.

79
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,594
Ah.

80
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,306
Uh, Peter, are you on the football squad?

81
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,809
Um, no, I play it,
but I'm not actually on the team.

82
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:41,269
- Oh, I see.
- Ah, not a team player.

83
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:43,855
Do you like to wrestle?

84
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:47,567
You OK, Peter?

85
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,488
The Brazilian turbot frog was added to
the endangered species list today.

86
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:55,616
- That's the third animal this year.
- Oh, dear.

87
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:58,619
The turbot frog?
I don't think I've ever heard of...

88
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:01,079
Um, excuse me, may I use the rest room?

89
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,165
Oh, of course. The one down here
isn't working very well.

90
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,627
- Go upstairs through Cecilia's room.
- OK. Thanks.

91
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:18,192
Hold... Hold on.

92
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,403
I thought you'd died in there.

93
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:26,157
Are you done hogging the bathroom?
I need something.

94
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:36,208
Do you mind?

95
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,010
- Thank you very much.
- You forgetting something?

96
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:53,349
Oh, Peter. Here's a little aerofoil
I thought you might find amusing.

97
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:55,434
It's a...

98
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:58,896
...demonstration of
Bernoulli's principle: lift.

99
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:05,110
From that time on,
the Lisbon house began to change.

100
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:11,073
Almost every day,...

101
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:14,076
...and even when
she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,...

102
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,787
...Lux would suntan wearing a swimsuit...

103
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:22,125
...that caused the knife sharpener to give
her a 15-minute demonstration for free.

104
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:29,257
Following the doctor's orders,
two weeks after Cecilia returned home...

105
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,303
...Mr. Lisbon persuaded his wife to allow
the girls to throw the first and only party...

106
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:36,972
...of their short lives.

107
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,857
There. Is that OK?

108
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,777
I'm gonna get dressed.

109
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:02,788
- Welcome!
- Good evening, Mrs. Lisbon.

110
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,373
Come on in.

111
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,169
The party's in the basement.

112
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:16,508
Just go on round to the left,
and then down the stairs.

113
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,189
Hi, I'm Bonaventure.

114
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:32,273
Hi.

115
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:34,859
- Hi. Tim.
- Nice to meet you.

116
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:38,695
Hi.

117
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,783
- Would you like some punch?
- Yeah.

118
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:44,743
Thanks.

119
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,328
- Hi.
- Hi.

120
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:50,081
Thanks.

121
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:52,708
- Hi.
- Thank you.

122
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:56,837
- Hey.
- Hi.

123
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,797
Do you wanna sit down?

124
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:01,383
- Yeah.
- Me too.

125
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:45,090
Um, how did your SATs go?

126
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:47,175
OK.

127
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:49,802
Good.

128
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:52,388
Do you know where you're applying yet?

129
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:56,267
Well, no, but my parents
are pushing towards Yale...

130
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,977
...'cos that's where my dad went.

131
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:02,481
That's nice.

132
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:07,068
You have to imagine
what it'd be like when...

133
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:11,155
...out of the sun would come the Hun
and his Messerschmitt coming down.

134
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:14,116
And boys, I swear,
two or three years older than you...

135
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,078
...would be in this - the P51 B Mustang.
B for what? For bull's-eye, see?

136
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:22,499
You've heard of Yale?

137
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:25,085
Oh, yeah.

138
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:27,670
This punch is fantastic.

139
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,381
- Can I give you more?
- Sure. What's in it?

140
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:34,593
Juices. Some cherry, pineapple.

141
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:38,806
You know, I uh... I love pineapple.

142
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:43,143
Really?

143
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,322
This baby would come in, and this won
the war for the United Kingdom. You see?

144
00:14:57,114 --> 00:14:59,700
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

145
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:04,663
And it's this kind of, uh...
this kind of equipment that makes, uh...

146
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:07,373
...a model work.

147
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,252
Here's Joe.

148
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,922
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

149
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:21,428
- Now, if he needs anything just call me.
- Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine.

150
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:26,808
Hi.

151
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:30,228
- Joe! Good to see you. How are ya?
- Hey, Joe.

152
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:33,147
- Glad you came tonight.
- How's it going?

153
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,649
You're just in time.

154
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:37,192
Good. Hi.

155
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:40,112
Everyone look! His ears wiggle
if you scratch his chin.

156
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,324
Joe, sing your song.

157
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:47,202
<i>* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga</i>

158
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:52,331
<i>* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
Got bitten off by whales</i>

159
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:56,710
<i>* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga</i>

160
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:59,546
Good job, Joe!

161
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,632
Good job, Joe.

162
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:07,220
Where'd you learn that song?

163
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:10,848
May I be excused?

164
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:14,560
If you want to, dear, but this is your party.

165
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:21,608
Oh, all right, if you want to go upstairs,
go ahead, but we'll just...

166
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:24,319
We'll just have to have fun without you.

167
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:27,739
Oh, look. He always chooses heads.

168
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:29,991
- Joe, what's it gonna be?
- Heads.

169
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:32,618
Joe, will you try tails?

170
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:35,538
Heads it is!

171
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,915
I'll show you again. Let's go.

172
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,666
- Heads.
- Tails.

173
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,001
Heads.

174
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,712
- One more time. In the air, Joe.
- Heads.

175
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,926
Heads it is anyway. One more time here.

176
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,511
- OK, call in the air, Joe.
- Heads.

177
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,223
Heads. Not bad.

178
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,977
How you doin'?

179
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,562
Good.

180
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,857
- You picked it up really well.
- It's my favourite song.

181
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:09,277
You know, you're... very beautiful.

182
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:13,531
I could paint you sometime.

183
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:17,034
Thanks.

184
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,707
- So did they sing it to you?
- Yeah.

185
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,295
Cecilia!

186
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:34,800
Cecilia!

187
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:53,067
Oh, my God...

188
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:56,153
No! No! No! Don't look. Turn around.

189
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,532
Turn around. Darlings, turn around.

190
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:03,410
Don't look. Don't... Don't look at this.

191
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:06,621
Oh, Jesus. Please, God.

192
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:30,698
OK.

193
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,419
- What did he say?
- He said she was only 13.

194
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:01,018
Oh, hi, Mary. Are your parents home?

195
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:03,645
Hi, Father Moody. Come in.

196
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:13,279
Oh, hello, Father.

197
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:16,991
Please, sit down.

198
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:19,284
Thanks.

199
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,912
Come on, Miller, that was inside.

200
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:25,999
Ah, no. No, thanks.

201
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:38,218
How about we get the missus down here,
have a little chat?

202
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,470
Afraid she's under the weather.

203
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,306
She's not really...

204
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:46,434
...seeing anybody.

205
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:50,480
Well, she'll see her priest.

206
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:54,900
Ah! This kid's a sucker
for the high inside ones every time.

207
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:57,611
Every time.

208
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:00,197
Excuse me.

209
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:05,160
Father.

210
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:12,959
Ah! Double play... Father.

211
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,504
Double play.

212
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:41,735
Mrs. Lisbon?

213
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,329
- May I come in?
- OK.

214
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:59,585
Hello, girls.

215
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,295
I thought we could talk.

216
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:05,298
Do you feel like talking?

217
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:10,344
Well, if you ever want to,
you know where to find me.

218
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:22,856
Mrs. Lisbon, it's Father Moody.

219
00:22:28,444 --> 00:22:31,072
Mrs. Lisbon, hello.

220
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:39,913
I wanted you to know that
I listed Cecilia's death as an accident.

221
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:58,305
An accident waiting to happen. John said
you couldn't get a policy to cover it.

222
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,724
I know. It's so incredibly dangerous.

223
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:03,268
Let's give it a try.

224
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,522
Ready?

225
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:10,149
One, two, three.

226
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,905
Oh, God. It's just so sad.
I can't even believe it.

227
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:19,575
Footings are too deep.

228
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,327
Got that chain in your truck?

229
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:43,722
Hit it!

230
00:23:57,818 --> 00:24:02,239
Our collection of souvenirs
of the Lisbon girls, which still exists,...

231
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:04,741
...started with Cecilia's diary.

232
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:08,286
Parkie had gotten it from Skip Ortega,
the plumber's assistant,...

233
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,788
...who had found it next to the toilet.

234
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:13,416
Tim Weiner - "the Brain" - decoded it.

235
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:15,709
Emotional instability.

236
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:19,046
Look at the i's.
The dots on 'em, they're everywhere.

237
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:22,757
Basically,...

238
00:24:22,757 --> 00:24:24,926
...what we have here is a dreamer.

239
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:27,512
Someone completely
out of touch with reality.

240
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:30,890
When she jumped,
she probably thought she would fly.

241
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:36,979
"Monday, February 13th.
Today we had frozen pizza."

242
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:45,528
"Thursday. Mom made creamed corn for
dinner. It's the worst. It looks like..."

243
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:51,075
"Mary chipped her front tooth
on the monkey bars."

244
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,995
"She made a big scene and had to
get it capped. It looks normal, I guess."

245
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,706
Here, give me that.

246
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,375
Told you she had a capped tooth.

247
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:09,175
Elm trees. How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

248
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,512
Here, something about Dominic.

249
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:18,308
"Palazzolo jumped off the roof
over that rich bitch Porter."

250
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,019
"How stupid can you be?"

251
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,607
"Today we went out on the boat.
It was cold."

252
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,775
"We saw a couple of whales."

253
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:31,320
"Lux stroked the whale.
I didn't think they'd stink so much."

254
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,115
"It's the kelp in their baleens rotting."

255
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,825
"I hope we can go again sometime."

256
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:40,245
Let's read that. "Lux lost it over Kevin..."

257
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,206
- Is it Heines?
- "Heines, the garbage man."

258
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,584
Lux lost it over Kevin Haines,
the garbage man.

259
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:50,630
She'd wake up at five in the morning
and hang out on the front steps -

260
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:52,882
...like it wasn't completely obvious.

261
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:55,885
She wrote his name in marker
on all her underwear.

262
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,554
Mom found them
and bleached out the Kevins.

263
00:25:58,554 --> 00:26:01,181
Lux was crying on her bed all day.

264
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:12,275
The trees like lungs filling with air.

265
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:16,278
My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair.

266
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:25,495
And so we started
to learn about their lives,...

267
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:29,749
...coming to hold collective memories
of times we hadn't experienced.

268
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:35,462
We felt the imprisonment of being a girl,
the way it made your mind dreamy...

269
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:38,173
...so you ended up knowing
what colours went together.

270
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:41,343
We knew the girls
were really women in disguise,...

271
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:44,346
...that they understood love
and even death,...

272
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:50,268
...and that our job was merely to create
the noise that seemed to fascinate them.

273
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:53,521
We knew that they knew
everything about us.

274
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:56,732
And that we couldn't fathom them at all.

275
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:12,580
Hi. Uh, Mrs. Lisbon, I'm Lydia Perl.

276
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:15,291
I'm putting together a... Oh.

277
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:19,545
- Hi, I'm Bonnie. This is Mary.
- Hello, girls.

278
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:24,841
Um, I'm here to ask you
a couple of questions about Cecilia.

279
00:27:26,676 --> 00:27:28,553
Yeah?

280
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:34,308
Great, great. Um, maybe you could start
by telling me a little bit about her.

281
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:38,979
Did she have any
special interests or hobbies?

282
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:43,525
- Um, she liked writing in her journal a lot.
- That is great.

283
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:47,403
Um, OK. Uh, did she...

284
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:50,198
Did she ever talk about ending her life?

285
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,867
What's going on here?

286
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,703
Um, you must be Mrs. Lisbon.

287
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:58,330
I'm Lydia Perl. I'm from Channel 2, and...

288
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,957
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

289
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,878
The suicide of an East Side teenager
last summer...

290
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:08,214
...has increased the awareness
of a national crisis.

291
00:28:08,298 --> 00:28:11,133
I'm in front of the home
where Cecilia Lisbon...

292
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:13,427
Why can't they let her rest in peace?

293
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:17,097
...and write poetry,
tragically put an end to her life.

294
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:21,018
Psychologists agree that adolescence
today is much more fraught...

295
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:24,396
...by pressures and complexities
than in years past.

296
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:28,691
More and more doctors say this
frustration can lead to acts of violence,...

297
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:33,612
...whose reality the adolescent cannot
separate from its intended drama.

298
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:37,700
I baked a pie full of rat poison.

299
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,579
I thought I could eat it, you know,
without being suspicious.

300
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:47,667
My nana, who is 86...

301
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,839
She really liked sweets.

302
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:58,093
She had three pieces.

303
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:05,850
I feel sorriest for the mother.

304
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,645
You'd always wonder if
there was something you could've done.

305
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:12,815
- I gotta go. See you later.
- All right, then. Bye-bye.

306
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:15,526
Bye-bye.

307
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:18,834
Don't worry.

308
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:21,920
They took the fence out.

309
00:30:42,355 --> 00:30:44,983
God, you snore loud.

310
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,485
Those girls have a bright future
ahead of them.

311
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:36,196
The other one
was just gonna end up a kook.

312
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,284
We didn't see the girls together as
a group until convocation, September 7th.

313
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:47,707
Mary, Lux, Bonnie and Therese came to
school as though nothing had happened.

314
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:49,959
We felt if we looked hard enough,...

315
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:53,838
...we might begin to understand what
they were feeling and who they were.

316
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:58,425
All right, so if we have - these are
Venn diagrams, as you remember...

317
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:02,262
If we have A and B intersecting,...

318
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:04,514
...and A and B...

319
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:07,559
If A intersects B, we have this area.

320
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:13,230
And if A is the union with B, we have
all of the circle, plus the intersection.

321
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:19,361
These are the laws of
intersection and union. OK?

322
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:33,040
How's it going?

323
00:32:33,624 --> 00:32:36,252
Not bad.

324
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:43,633
"Do a character sketch on the following
characters from Portrait Of A Lady."

325
00:32:43,717 --> 00:32:46,636
The first one is... Ralph.

326
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:49,806
Um, he was nice.

327
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:52,516
It was really sad when he died.

328
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,730
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I just said that.

329
00:32:57,813 --> 00:33:00,440
I am so sorry.

330
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,246
Reading about
the alarming suicide rate,...

331
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,707
...I talked to Mr. Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here...

332
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:22,461
...and realized that nothing
about this serious matter...

333
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:25,255
...has been discussed at this school.

334
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:28,508
Quickly thereafter
green pamphlets were distributed.

335
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:32,428
We thought green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.

336
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,680
Certainly better than red.

337
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,766
They told us there were
80 suicides a day in America,...

338
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,478
-...30,000 a year,...
- Cheese!

339
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,023
...and alerted us to danger signals
we couldn't help but look for.

340
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,109
Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?

341
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,446
Had they lost interest in school activities,
in sports and hobbies?

342
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:55,115
Had they withdrawn from their peers?

343
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,828
Hi. I'm Chase.

344
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:03,623
I know who you are.

345
00:34:04,124 --> 00:34:07,252
I've only been going to this school
my whole life.

346
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:11,005
You don't have to talk to me.

347
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:24,059
For example, we have
two different types of economics -

348
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:29,147
...or so-called two different types.
The first one is called macroeconomics.

349
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,984
Look. She's laughing.

350
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:39,781
He made her laugh! I've never heard him
say anything remotely intelligent.

351
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:44,494
The boys who talked with Lux
were always the stupidest...

352
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:47,163
...and made terrible
sources of information.

353
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:49,665
Squeezebox is all right.

354
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:53,252
Let me tell you, she's the hottest girl
in the school for sure.

355
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:57,214
Do you wanna know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

356
00:34:57,715 --> 00:35:00,092
Nah, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

357
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:03,303
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what I mean.

358
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:08,266
But the only reliable boy
who actually got to know Lux...

359
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:12,979
...was Trip Fontaine, who only
eight months before the suicides...

360
00:35:13,062 --> 00:35:16,982
...had emerged from baby fat
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

361
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:21,361
I'm late again.

362
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:26,324
Oh, come on.

363
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:37,501
Thank you.

364
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:50,359
All the girls at our school
were in love with Trip.

365
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:54,071
All the girls except for Lux.

366
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:57,032
Trip told us his passion for Lux started...

367
00:36:57,074 --> 00:37:01,119
...when he went into the wrong
history class during fifth period.

368
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:04,623
He went out to his car
to smoke the marijuana he took...

369
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:09,293
...as regularly as Peter Petrovich,
the diabetic kid, took his insulin.

370
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:17,301
On this particular day
he ran into Mr. Woodhouse...

371
00:37:17,384 --> 00:37:20,012
...and ducked into the nearest class.

372
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:37,528
She was the still point
of the turning world, man.

373
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:42,199
I never got over that girl. Never.

374
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,037
I mean... you know,
I loved a lot of ladies, but not like that.

375
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:50,748
That was real.

376
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:55,085
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.
I didn't know what had hit me.

377
00:37:55,836 --> 00:37:58,422
I didn't know what to do...

378
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:01,550
...'cos it was so easy
with all the other girls,...

379
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:04,135
...but she wouldn't look at me.

380
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:06,096
I, uh...

381
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:09,640
I was never the kind to pursue,
if you know what I mean.

382
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:15,938
That girl drove me crazy, man.

383
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:33,204
Mm, yummy. Warm.

384
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,497
Lux.

385
00:38:35,497 --> 00:38:38,083
Hey.

386
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:45,382
- Look at it. It's just meat on bread.
- Eugh! Sick!

387
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:49,135
Thanks, Mom.

388
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:58,852
Trip's dad was little help.

389
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:05,900
Well, first off, don't call her on the phone.

390
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:09,362
It's all, um... it's all subtlety.

391
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:11,405
It's all nuance.

392
00:39:11,405 --> 00:39:14,533
Yeah. You just need
to talk to her at school, you know,...

393
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:18,745
...about anything. About the weather,
or school assignments.

394
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:22,332
Um, you know, anything
to have the chance to communicate...

395
00:39:22,415 --> 00:39:25,293
...with the language of eye contact.

396
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:28,212
And, uh, project confidence.

397
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:31,882
And keep the hair out of your eyes.

398
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:36,095
She'll feel the vibe.

399
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:45,186
- Just be yourself.
- Yeah.

400
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:50,525
The word hurricane was the name...

401
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:53,569
...given to nature's strongest storm.

402
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:57,448
A hurricane occurs when high pressure
and low pressure masses of air...

403
00:39:57,531 --> 00:40:00,158
...come in contact with one another.

404
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:06,456
There is often a significant difference
in temperature between the two masses.

405
00:40:07,248 --> 00:40:09,834
One mass is warm,
while the other is cold.

406
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:15,172
The warmer air rises
and the cooler air falls.

407
00:40:16,924 --> 00:40:22,012
Likewise, the low pressure slides down
the sides of the high-pressure area.

408
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:27,016
They swirl in and around one another,
creating the beginnings of the storm.

409
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,147
In this footage, taken from
US Navy weather patrol aircraft,...

410
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,816
...we can clearly observe
the two masses,...

411
00:40:35,816 --> 00:40:40,821
...one high pressure and one low,
coming in contact with one another.

412
00:40:44,157 --> 00:40:47,160
The result is a surging storm
of tremendous strength...

413
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:50,288
...that strikes with forceful determination.

414
00:40:57,169 --> 00:41:00,714
Even though the hurricane is
the most powerful storm known to us...

415
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:10,098
Must have been Conley.

416
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,725
His ass is grass.

417
00:41:17,646 --> 00:41:20,232
I'm gonna ask you out.

418
00:41:21,942 --> 00:41:24,569
Fat chance.

419
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:31,867
First I'm gonna come over to your house
on Sunday and watch the tube.

420
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:34,537
Then I'm gonna ask you out.

421
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,547
You're a stone fox.

422
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,635
The hurricane... one of the most truly
awe-inspiring and spectacular storms...

423
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:53,345
...nature has to offer.

424
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:02,437
- What channel's this?
- Five.

425
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:06,983
Ah, let's see. Um, Animals In The Wild.

426
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,861
"Journey through the African Kalahari...

427
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,947
...as we visit exotic animals
in their natural habitat."

428
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,658
I think that sounds very nice, don't you?

429
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,747
The rainforest eventually
gives way to expansive arid grasslands...

430
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,291
...that stretch to the horizon
in all directions.

431
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,002
This is the Kalahari.

432
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,255
Uh, do you want some more pop?

433
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:34,467
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

434
00:42:39,263 --> 00:42:41,890
Thanks.

435
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:49,439
The wildlife spectacle played out
on these vast open grasslands...

436
00:42:49,522 --> 00:42:54,110
...and in the deep recesses of
the rainforest is unparalleled on Earth.

437
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:06,079
Lux, please put your feet down, honey.

438
00:43:11,584 --> 00:43:14,753
The Kalahari and its vast open skies
provide the theatre...

439
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:21,760
...for the drama played out by the herds
and the great cats that prey on them.

440
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,097
Oh, my!

441
00:43:26,097 --> 00:43:28,725
It's getting so late. Honey?

442
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:34,438
- I said it's getting late.
- Yeah? Oh.

443
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,566
Well, Skip, we usually
hit the hay about now, so...

444
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:42,195
Right.

445
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,867
- OK.
- Thank you.

446
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:49,243
OK, so...

447
00:43:49,243 --> 00:43:51,829
- It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Lisbon.
- Yes.

448
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,457
- Good night.
- See you.

449
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:19,271
Bye.

450
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:26,528
Bye.

451
00:45:33,255 --> 00:45:35,841
Gotta get back before bed check.

452
00:45:56,735 --> 00:45:59,321
Ahem.

453
00:46:01,698 --> 00:46:04,743
Uh, this is fourth period.
I don't have you until fifth.

454
00:46:04,826 --> 00:46:06,369
- I know.
- Oh.

455
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:08,997
I'm not here for math today, sir.

456
00:46:11,707 --> 00:46:16,128
I'm here to tell you that my intentions
for your daughter are honourable.

457
00:46:18,464 --> 00:46:21,091
What... might those intentions be?

458
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,386
I wanna ask Lux to
the Homecoming dance.

459
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:29,599
Trip, why don't you sit down
for a minute?

460
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:36,522
You see, my wife and I have certain rules.

461
00:46:37,439 --> 00:46:42,277
They've been the same for the older girls.
I can't change them for the younger ones.

462
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,238
Even if I wanted to,
the wife wouldn't let me.

463
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:48,199
True. So, uh...

464
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:51,953
If you want to come over and
watch TV again, that would be fine,...

465
00:46:52,078 --> 00:46:56,123
...but you cannot take Lux out,
especially not in a car.

466
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:58,917
So I'm sorry, son, that's just our policy.

467
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,882
OK, sir, what if there was
a bunch of us guys...

468
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:08,676
...and we took
all your daughters out in a group...

469
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,470
...and we had 'em back
by whatever time you said?

470
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:15,099
- Are you on the football squad, son?
- Yes, sir.

471
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:18,185
- Ah. What position?
- Defensive cornerback.

472
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,771
Ah. Good. Good.

473
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,815
I was a...
I was a safety in my day.

474
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,735
That's a crucial position, sir.
Nothing between you and the goal line.

475
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:30,279
Exactly! Exactly.

476
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:31,781
Oh, well...

477
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:35,659
So the thing is, sir, we've got
the big game against Country Day,...

478
00:47:35,743 --> 00:47:40,622
...then afterwards we have the dance and...
all the other guys are taking dates.

479
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:44,959
You're a good-looking fellow, Trip.
Lots of girls would go with you, I bet.

480
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:49,630
Yeah, well, I'm not interested
in lots of girls, sir.

481
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:59,097
I'll take it up with the wife, Trip.
Do what I can.

482
00:48:00,932 --> 00:48:03,518
Thank you, sir.

483
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:07,272
- It's a graph.
- Oh.

484
00:48:08,523 --> 00:48:11,150
Mm.

485
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:18,949
Trip Fontaine and some of the...

486
00:48:19,408 --> 00:48:24,329
...other boys in the football squad asked to
take the girls to the Homecoming dance.

487
00:48:24,412 --> 00:48:27,165
You know how I feel
about that sort of thing.

488
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:31,460
- I'm gonna be a chaperon at the dance.
- Oh, come on, Mom. Please!

489
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:35,047
Your father and I will discuss it later.

490
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:40,677
Mr. Fontaine,
may I speak with you, please?

491
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:44,347
Now, my wife and I have had a little talk...

492
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:47,684
...and we've come to a decision
about your request.

493
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,198
Yes!

494
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:09,620
I'm taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

495
00:49:09,704 --> 00:49:12,873
I need three guys to take the other girls.

496
00:49:19,713 --> 00:49:21,673
I'll give you three joints, Trip.

497
00:49:21,673 --> 00:49:25,010
Come on, Trip, man. You pick me,
we can take my dad's Caddy.

498
00:49:25,176 --> 00:49:27,762
You gotta pick me, Tripster!

499
00:49:28,513 --> 00:49:31,098
Trip, man, you owe me.

500
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:33,934
I saved your ass
with Woodhouse that time.

501
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:35,853
- Thanks, Dad!
- OK.

502
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:38,522
- Who are the other boys?
- Ah, let's see.

503
00:49:38,605 --> 00:49:41,942
Parker Denton and Jake Conley.
He's a very good student, dear.

504
00:49:42,025 --> 00:49:44,736
And, uh... Kevin Head.

505
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,113
- Who's taking who?
- Whom.

506
00:49:47,113 --> 00:49:49,741
They're just gonna raffle us off.

507
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:55,788
It made no difference which pattern
of their dream dresses the girls chose.

508
00:49:55,871 --> 00:50:00,250
Mrs. Lisbon added an inch to the
bust line and two to the waist and hems.

509
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,962
And the dresses came out
as four identical sacks.

510
00:50:04,337 --> 00:50:06,965
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah.

511
00:50:08,007 --> 00:50:10,593
OK. Come on.

512
00:50:13,304 --> 00:50:16,724
Oh, I'm sorry. OK, there we go.
OK, come on, together.

513
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:19,977
- There's a leak.
- And Cheddar cheese!

514
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,774
I'm so excited!

515
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:49,045
- You ready?
- Let's go.

516
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:51,756
- Ready, man.
- Let's do it.

517
00:50:57,177 --> 00:51:00,138
In the end Parkie won
because of the Cadillac,...

518
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:02,807
...Kevin Head because
he had the killer weed...

519
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:05,769
...and Joe Hill Conley
because he won school prizes -

520
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:09,397
...which Trip thought
would impress Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon.

521
00:51:11,023 --> 00:51:13,692
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Mrs. Lisbon.

522
00:51:14,401 --> 00:51:15,903
Come in.

523
00:51:15,903 --> 00:51:18,530
Thank you.

524
00:51:30,082 --> 00:51:33,294
- Uh, who... who... who's driving?
- I am.

525
00:51:33,419 --> 00:51:35,671
How long have you had your license?

526
00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:38,590
Two months, but I had
my learner's permit for a year.

527
00:51:38,674 --> 00:51:42,469
We almost never let the girls
go out in cars unless it's necessary.

528
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:46,681
There's so many accidents nowadays.
I'm sure you will be very careful.

529
00:51:46,764 --> 00:51:49,892
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- OK, third degree's over!

530
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:53,312
Girls!

531
00:51:54,813 --> 00:51:58,775
- I better get going. See you at the dance.
- See you there, Mr. Lisbon.

532
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:01,236
Bye, dear.

533
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:03,822
See you later.

534
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:10,161
Girls, come on down.

535
00:52:10,536 --> 00:52:13,164
The boys are here.

536
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:39,813
We got white ones.

537
00:52:40,105 --> 00:52:44,025
We didn't know what you were wearing,
and the guy, the flower guy, said...

538
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:46,736
...that white would go with anything, so...

539
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,198
I'm glad you got white.

540
00:52:51,449 --> 00:52:54,076
Why don't you pin them on?

541
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,507
Don't stick me!

542
00:53:21,476 --> 00:53:24,020
There we go. All right. Let's do it.

543
00:53:26,231 --> 00:53:28,232
Bye, Mom.

544
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:30,860
Bye.

545
00:53:38,534 --> 00:53:41,536
Oh my gosh, look, you guys.
Her car's there late again.

546
00:53:41,661 --> 00:53:43,997
Mr. Leo's having an affair with the maid.

547
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:46,541
I saw him follow her
into the laundry room.

548
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:50,461
- Eugh! He's so fat, and that red nose.
- Totally an alcoholic.

549
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:53,172
What about the Hessens?
You know they're Nazis.

550
00:53:53,172 --> 00:53:55,257
They're Nazi sympathizers, Bonnie.

551
00:53:55,257 --> 00:53:59,761
They had a fit when the Schwartzmans
tried to join the tennis club.

552
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:04,182
Nice aluminium siding
Do they really think that looks OK?

553
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:07,560
Mr. Kriegers ordered that
from TV late at night.

554
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:12,773
- It's the Baldinos' barbecue tree stump.
- I have never seen them barbecue on it.

555
00:54:12,857 --> 00:54:15,901
Actually it's an escape tunnel
for Sammy "the Shark".

556
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:20,197
- Leads to a river where he has his boat.
- Yeah. Paul goes there all the time.

557
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,533
He can get into anyone's basement
through the storm sewers.

558
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:26,077
- No way.
- Yeah.

559
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:28,705
Cool.

560
00:54:40,757 --> 00:54:43,927
- Dad'll smell it on you.
- No, I got mints.

561
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:47,388
He'll smell it on your clothes.

562
00:54:47,388 --> 00:54:51,142
I'll just tell him some kids
were smoking in the bathroom.

563
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,520
Don't let it die a virgin.

564
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,398
- That's gross!
- Yeah, grow up, Conley.

565
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:56,660
- Uh, do you wanna dance?
- Sure.

566
00:56:22,517 --> 00:56:25,937
We've been having such
lovely weather, don't you think?

567
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,023
Yeah. Yeah, it's been nice.

568
00:56:37,614 --> 00:56:41,118
Good evening, everyone.
If I could have your attention...

569
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:44,746
I hope you're all having a good time.
Sure looks like it.

570
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:47,457
Here's a spot.

571
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:52,878
I'd like to open the voting
for Homecoming king and queen.

572
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:57,091
The ballot box is at the refreshments
table, so please cast your votes...

573
00:56:57,174 --> 00:57:01,303
...and we'll make the announcement
in a little while. Thank you.

574
00:57:01,636 --> 00:57:03,847
"I'm Not In Love")

575
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,807
Did anybody see you come in?

576
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:07,517
No.

577
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:10,103
- What about you?
- No.

578
00:57:14,356 --> 00:57:16,984
You'll love it.

579
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:24,783
Peach schnapps.

580
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:27,535
Babes love it.

581
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:46,219
That stuff tastes really good.

582
00:57:47,178 --> 00:57:49,764
I don't want any, thanks.

583
00:57:49,806 --> 00:57:52,767
Come on, just a taste. A tiny taste.

584
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:55,561
Don't be such a goody-goody.

585
00:58:00,565 --> 00:58:03,151
Don't swallow it!

586
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,660
Can I have everyone's attention, please?
Thank you.

587
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:03,164
I'd like you all to put your hands together
for this year's king and queen...

588
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,875
...Trip Fontaine and Lux Lisbon.

589
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:36,153
All right, Luxie!

590
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:36,583
I'm having the best time!

591
01:00:52,556 --> 01:00:54,767
Let's go for a walk.

592
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:57,728
We better not.
We've gotta go back in a minute.

593
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:02,691
We can keep an eye on the car.
They won't leave without us.

594
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:07,153
My dad.

595
01:01:07,153 --> 01:01:10,323
Just tell him you had to put
the crown in your locker.

596
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:14,702
- Hey, see that divot there?
- Uh-huh.

597
01:01:14,702 --> 01:01:18,580
That's where I reamed this guy today
in a cross-body block.

598
01:01:19,122 --> 01:01:21,708
Really?

599
01:01:22,876 --> 01:01:26,421
- Maybe they went with your dad.
- I doubt it.

600
01:01:28,631 --> 01:01:31,259
- We're cooked.
- Luxie is. We're not.

601
01:01:49,692 --> 01:01:52,278
Does anyone have any mints?

602
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:54,905
- Sorry.
- No.

603
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:01,787
Bye, Parkie.

604
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:06,666
- We'll walk you to the door.
- No, don't.

605
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:09,335
Why not?

606
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:11,963
Just don't.

607
01:02:13,672 --> 01:02:15,966
OK.

608
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:18,343
Will you call me?

609
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:20,929
Uh, absolutely.

610
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,852
- Bye.
- Bye.

611
01:02:27,894 --> 01:02:30,480
Bye.

612
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,460
Where have you been?

613
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,757
Get in!

614
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:27,684
I walked home alone that night.

615
01:05:27,684 --> 01:05:30,436
I didn't care how she got home.
It was weird.

616
01:05:31,062 --> 01:05:35,274
I mean, I liked her, I liked her a lot,
but out there on the field...

617
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:41,113
It was just different then.

618
01:05:43,782 --> 01:05:46,367
That was the last time I saw her.

619
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:52,540
You know, most people
will never taste that kind of love.

620
01:05:53,165 --> 01:05:55,751
But at least I tasted it once, right?

621
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:03,925
It's time for your
six o'clock group meeting.

622
01:06:18,856 --> 01:06:23,235
Given Lux's failure to make curfew,
everyone expected a crackdown.

623
01:06:25,403 --> 01:06:28,197
But few anticipated it would be so drastic.

624
01:06:29,032 --> 01:06:31,367
The girls were taken out of school...

625
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:35,496
...and Mrs. Lisbon shut the house
in maximum security isolation.

626
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:40,625
She had done more than
just take the girls out of school.

627
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:44,004
That Sunday,
arriving home from a church sermon,...

628
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:47,090
...Mrs. Lisbon commanded Lux
to destroy her rock records.

629
01:06:47,173 --> 01:06:49,133
Now!

630
01:06:49,133 --> 01:06:51,302
But, Mom!

631
01:06:51,302 --> 01:06:53,637
This is final, Luxie.

632
01:06:53,637 --> 01:06:57,224
- It's not fair!
- I said now!

633
01:07:14,532 --> 01:07:17,117
Now, Luxie!

634
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,756
Come on.

635
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,341
Hold on.

636
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:40,055
Kiss! Please don't make me do this.

637
01:07:40,138 --> 01:07:42,724
Burn it.

638
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:56,695
Oh, Mom. Aerosmith!

639
01:07:56,695 --> 01:07:59,406
- Come on. Don't make me burn this.
- No.

640
01:08:01,116 --> 01:08:03,743
What's that smell?

641
01:08:04,536 --> 01:08:08,664
It's all right. That'll do for now.
Give me these. Give me these.

642
01:08:09,457 --> 01:08:12,043
I'll put them in the trash.

643
01:08:49,202 --> 01:08:52,747
This was the time we began to see Lux
making love on the roof...

644
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,790
...with random boys and men.

645
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:57,376
- Is she naked?
- You can't tell. Hold on.

646
01:08:57,376 --> 01:08:59,962
Well, get it focused.

647
01:09:00,253 --> 01:09:03,923
- Will you stop? Wait your turn.
- What are they doing?

648
01:09:04,549 --> 01:09:08,177
- They're rolling around up there.
- Let me see. Let me see.

649
01:09:08,302 --> 01:09:12,348
Hold on. And she's on him and
he's rubbing his hands through her hair.

650
01:09:12,431 --> 01:09:16,310
- Come on, let me look.
- No, it's my... It's my telescope, Chase!

651
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:19,229
Yes, and what else?

652
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:24,150
Our male up there
seems to be in a Burger Chalet uniform!

653
01:09:26,194 --> 01:09:30,490
That Burger Chalet - you never think
those guys ever get lucky.

654
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,118
She turns to me and asks me
if I thought what we'd done was dirty.

655
01:09:34,201 --> 01:09:36,578
I knew what to say. I said no.

656
01:09:36,578 --> 01:09:39,581
Then she grabs my hand
and goes "You like me, don't you?"

657
01:09:39,665 --> 01:09:43,501
I didn't say anything.
It's best to keep chicks guessing.

658
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:47,797
Chase, honey!
Come practice your violin before dinner!

659
01:09:50,341 --> 01:09:54,512
You're not gonna believe it.
Lux is on the roof again tonight!

660
01:09:54,595 --> 01:09:57,765
- Her hands are moving down.
- I gotta see this!

661
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:01,893
- This is beautiful.
- No, no. She's on top of him.

662
01:10:02,686 --> 01:10:05,271
- What's she doin', man?
- Wait.

663
01:10:06,105 --> 01:10:08,733
Now they're done, he's getting up.

664
01:10:11,277 --> 01:10:13,237
- That's it?
- Popcorn.

665
01:10:13,237 --> 01:10:15,864
That was quick.

666
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:32,004
Ooh, good morning!
Good morning

667
01:10:32,463 --> 01:10:35,049
Have we photosynthesized
breakfast today?

668
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,603
Hello, Ronald.

669
01:10:48,728 --> 01:10:50,479
Hi, Eric.

670
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,899
Your daughters haven't been at school
for over two weeks.

671
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:58,737
You checked out back?

672
01:11:02,949 --> 01:11:05,535
They found a new math teacher.

673
01:11:06,327 --> 01:11:09,455
- Well, he's gonna have to get another job.
- I know.

674
01:11:10,623 --> 01:11:14,376
How long can those girls
be cooped up like that?

675
01:11:34,728 --> 01:11:37,689
- Just go away. This is our tree.
- Girls!

676
01:11:37,773 --> 01:11:41,359
Girls, it's a little late. This tree is dead.

677
01:11:41,443 --> 01:11:45,113
- Why not leave it up to nature?
- If we did, there'd be no trees left.

678
01:11:45,613 --> 01:11:47,991
That's what it's gonna be like anyway.

679
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:51,535
If boats hadn't brought the fungus,
this wouldn't have happened.

680
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:54,205
OK? Let's go.

681
01:11:55,998 --> 01:11:57,708
No?

682
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:59,668
All right. That's it.

683
01:11:59,668 --> 01:12:03,922
I have an order to cut down your elm tree,
but your kids won't let us.

684
01:12:04,005 --> 01:12:08,676
- How do you know that tree's sick?
- It had yellow leaves. The tree is dead.

685
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:12,096
Our daughter said Aritex is
a less aggressive therapy.

686
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:16,016
It doesn't work. I leave that tree,
they'll all be gone by next year.

687
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,393
Will be anyway, way things are going!

688
01:12:18,393 --> 01:12:20,771
I don't want to call the police.

689
01:12:20,771 --> 01:12:25,817
Our daughters are standing on their own
front lawn. Since when is that a crime?

690
01:12:27,485 --> 01:12:29,237
Right.

691
01:12:29,237 --> 01:12:31,822
Uh...

692
01:12:40,914 --> 01:12:45,835
Clive, did you see those girls in the
nighties? That's the shot that I want, OK?

693
01:12:45,919 --> 01:12:48,880
Honey, move forward.
I want those girls in the nighties.

694
01:12:48,963 --> 01:12:52,425
Oh, God. OK.
Here, let's just back up a little bit.

695
01:12:54,802 --> 01:12:57,387
There you go. Is that good? OK?

696
01:12:58,514 --> 01:13:01,767
Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon,
the East Side teenager...

697
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:06,146
...whose suicide last summer focused
awareness on a national problem,...

698
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:12,318
...put their own lives in jeopardy by trying
to protect the elm that Cecilia so loved.

699
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:07,619
For the next few weeks
we hardly saw the girls at all.

700
01:14:10,037 --> 01:14:13,666
Joe Hill Conley didn't call Therese
as he had promised.

701
01:14:18,629 --> 01:14:21,256
And Lux never spoke to Trip again.

702
01:14:24,509 --> 01:14:27,095
You're a stone fox.

703
01:14:31,849 --> 01:14:34,476
The girls' only contact with the outside...

704
01:14:34,476 --> 01:14:38,272
...was through catalogues they ordered
that filled their mailbox...

705
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:44,069
...with pictures of high-end fashions
and brochures for exotic vacations.

706
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:46,905
Unable to go anywhere,...

707
01:14:46,905 --> 01:14:50,825
...the girls traveled in their imaginations
to Siamese temples...

708
01:14:50,908 --> 01:14:55,996
...or passed an old man with a leaf broom
tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

709
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,709
We ordered the same catalogues...

710
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:04,838
...and, flipping through the pages,
we hiked through passes with the girls,...

711
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:09,217
...stopping every now and then
to help them with their backpacks,...

712
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,511
...placing our hands
on their warm, moist shoulders...

713
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:15,472
...and gazing off at papaya sunsets.

714
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:19,810
We drank tea with them
in a water pavilion.

715
01:15:20,686 --> 01:15:23,313
We did whatever we wanted.

716
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:28,067
Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

717
01:15:31,195 --> 01:15:33,739
The only way
we could feel close to the girls...

718
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:38,702
...was through these impossible trips
which have scarred us forever,...

719
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:42,330
...making us happier
with dreams than wives.

720
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:49,295
Collecting everything we could of theirs,
the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds.

721
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,839
But they were slipping away.

722
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:57,010
The colour of their eyes was fading, along
with the locations of moles and dimples.

723
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,263
From five they had become four,...

724
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:03,933
...and they were all living in the dead,
becoming shadows.

725
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,687
We'd have lost them completely
if they hadn't contacted us.

726
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:10,398
OK, one long,...

727
01:16:10,606 --> 01:16:13,192
...two short...

728
01:16:13,192 --> 01:16:15,402
-...and one long.
- Mm-hm.

729
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:17,988
You got that? That's it.

730
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:23,118
"Help."

731
01:16:23,118 --> 01:16:25,745
"Send...

732
01:16:26,412 --> 01:16:28,373
...bo...

733
01:16:28,373 --> 01:16:31,000
...bo."

734
01:16:31,876 --> 01:16:33,419
- Bo-bo?
- Bo-bo.

735
01:16:33,419 --> 01:16:36,463
That's what it says: bo-bo.

736
01:16:36,588 --> 01:16:40,884
"Help send bo-bo"?
I thought you knew Morse code.

737
01:17:09,327 --> 01:17:11,912
Something here for you.

738
01:17:19,169 --> 01:17:21,797
I got one, too.

739
01:17:23,632 --> 01:17:26,551
We racked our brains
for a way of contacting them.

740
01:17:26,634 --> 01:17:30,805
Tom Faheem suggested we fly a kite
with a message alongside the house,...

741
01:17:30,888 --> 01:17:33,182
...but that had logistical problems.

742
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:36,477
In the end, the answer was so simple
it took a week to work out.

743
01:17:37,102 --> 01:17:39,479
We called them on the telephone.

744
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:41,273
727...

745
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:44,359
-...8221.
- 8221.

746
01:17:44,442 --> 01:17:47,070
Get ready.

747
01:17:48,905 --> 01:17:51,490
- Hello?
- Go!

748
01:17:53,909 --> 01:17:56,537
<i>* Hello, it's me</i>

749
01:17:58,914 --> 01:18:03,835
<i>* I've thought about us
for a long, long time</i>

750
01:18:03,918 --> 01:18:06,546
Call us. 7270487.

751
01:18:11,509 --> 01:18:14,094
Shit! It's them.

752
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,644
<i>* To think that only yesterday</i>

753
01:18:22,727 --> 01:18:25,271
<i>* I was cheerful, bright and gay</i>

754
01:18:25,271 --> 01:18:27,899
<i>* Looking forward to - who wouldn't do? -</i>

755
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,776
<i>* The role I was about to play</i>

756
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,487
<i>* But in my hour of need</i>

757
01:18:33,571 --> 01:18:36,198
<i>* I truly am indeed</i>

758
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:38,742
<i>* Alone again</i>

759
01:18:38,742 --> 01:18:40,285
<i>* Naturally</i>

760
01:18:40,285 --> 01:18:46,374
<i>* Run to me whenever you're lonely</i>

761
01:18:46,457 --> 01:18:52,713
<i>* Run to me if you need a shoulder</i>

762
01:18:52,797 --> 01:18:59,386
<i>* Now and then you need someone older</i>

763
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:01,888
<i>* So darling</i>

764
01:19:01,888 --> 01:19:05,558
<i>* So far away</i>

765
01:19:05,642 --> 01:19:11,897
<i>* Doesn't anybody stay
in one place any more?</i>

766
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:18,237
<i>* It would be so fine
to see your face at my door</i>

767
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:26,369
<i>* Doesn't help to know you're just far</i>

768
01:19:26,452 --> 01:19:28,579
<i>* Away</i>

769
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:31,165
I gotta go home. See ya tomorrow.

770
01:19:31,165 --> 01:19:33,793
I'll see you later.

771
01:19:36,962 --> 01:19:40,298
- We're suffocating.
- You're safe here.

772
01:19:40,382 --> 01:19:43,009
I can't breathe in here.

773
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:46,554
No answer.

774
01:20:07,949 --> 01:20:10,576
- What time is it?
- Any time now.

775
01:20:11,202 --> 01:20:13,829
- Guys, there it is.
- What?

776
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:20,043
Yeah, it's them.

777
01:20:20,711 --> 01:20:23,296
Let's go!

778
01:20:34,223 --> 01:20:36,809
I have keys to my mom's car.

779
01:20:44,524 --> 01:20:47,151
Shh!

780
01:21:00,831 --> 01:21:03,458
Maybe we should knock.

781
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:11,215
We're here.

782
01:21:20,265 --> 01:21:22,434
About time.

783
01:21:22,434 --> 01:21:25,061
We've been waiting for you guys.

784
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:28,481
We got a car, a full tank.
We'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

785
01:21:28,564 --> 01:21:31,192
It's just a Cougar, but it's got a big trunk.

786
01:21:31,484 --> 01:21:34,111
Can I sit up front?

787
01:21:34,695 --> 01:21:37,322
Sure.

788
01:21:38,824 --> 01:21:42,160
Which one of you
is gonna sit up front next to me?

789
01:21:43,536 --> 01:21:46,080
Where are your parents?

790
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,665
Asleep.

791
01:21:47,665 --> 01:21:51,043
- What about your sisters?
- They're coming.

792
01:21:51,877 --> 01:21:54,505
Come on, it's getting late.

793
01:21:55,631 --> 01:21:59,676
Wait five minutes. We had to wait
until my parents were asleep.

794
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,513
They take for ever.
My mom's an insomniac.

795
01:22:07,642 --> 01:22:10,311
We better take our car.
There's more room.

796
01:22:11,979 --> 01:22:14,565
Think you can handle a station wagon?

797
01:22:15,357 --> 01:22:18,402
Sure. It's not a stick, is it?

798
01:22:18,485 --> 01:22:21,113
- No.
- Yeah, no problem.

799
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:24,616
- Will you let me steer?
- Sure.

800
01:22:25,033 --> 01:22:28,244
But maybe we should go.
I heard somethin'. Could be your mom.

801
01:22:29,036 --> 01:22:31,622
Come on in.

802
01:22:41,047 --> 01:22:45,176
I'll go wait in the car.
You guys wait here for my sisters.

803
01:23:41,311 --> 01:23:45,231
These girls are making me crazy.
If I could feel one of 'em up just once...

804
01:23:48,901 --> 01:23:51,529
What?

805
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,297
We would never be sure
about the sequence of events.

806
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:14,383
We argue about it still.

807
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:20,806
Most likely Bonnie had died while we
were waiting in the living room,...

808
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,516
...dreaming of highways.

809
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:27,228
Mary put her head in the oven
shortly thereafter.

810
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:32,650
Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills,
was gone by the time we got there.

811
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,986
Lux was the last to go.

812
01:24:45,036 --> 01:24:49,290
It's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
Do you know where your children are?

813
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:08,933
This has been Lydia Perl
with Channel 8 News.

814
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:21,653
None of my daughters
lacked for any love.

815
01:25:23,154 --> 01:25:25,907
There was plenty of love in our house.

816
01:25:27,742 --> 01:25:30,369
I never understood why...

817
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:07,612
After the suicide free-for-all the Lisbons
gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.

818
01:26:09,989 --> 01:26:12,658
They had Mr. Hedlie pack up the house,...

819
01:26:12,742 --> 01:26:15,911
...selling what furniture he could
in a garage sale.

820
01:26:18,288 --> 01:26:20,832
Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market...

821
01:26:20,832 --> 01:26:23,752
...and it was sold to
a young couple from Boston.

822
01:26:24,419 --> 01:26:28,381
We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.

823
01:26:31,467 --> 01:26:36,305
We had pieces of the puzzle, but however
we put them together, gaps remained -

824
01:26:37,055 --> 01:26:40,851
...oddly shaped emptiness,
mapped by what surrounded them...

825
01:26:40,934 --> 01:26:43,561
...like countries we couldn't name.

826
01:26:46,689 --> 01:26:53,279
What lingered after them was not life,
but the most trivial list of mundane facts...

827
01:26:56,448 --> 01:26:59,076
...a clock ticking on the wall,...

828
01:26:59,868 --> 01:27:02,454
...a room dim at noon,...

829
01:27:03,246 --> 01:27:07,792
...the outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.

830
01:27:12,505 --> 01:27:16,258
We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.

831
01:27:22,931 --> 01:27:26,184
Our parents seemed
better able to do this,...

832
01:27:26,267 --> 01:27:29,562
...returning to their tennis foursomes
and cocktail cruises...

833
01:27:29,645 --> 01:27:32,815
...as though they'd seen this all before.

834
01:27:33,274 --> 01:27:38,654
It was full-fledged summer again, over
a year since Cecilia had slit her wrists,...

835
01:27:38,737 --> 01:27:41,323
...spreading the poison in the air.

836
01:27:41,406 --> 01:27:44,576
A spill at the plant
increased the phosphates in the lake...

837
01:27:44,701 --> 01:27:48,996
...and produced a scum of algae so thick
that the swamp smell filled the air,...

838
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,666
...infiltrating the genteel mansions.

839
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:56,462
Debutantes cried over the misfortune
of coming out in a season...

840
01:27:56,545 --> 01:27:59,506
...everyone would remember
for its bad smell.

841
01:27:59,589 --> 01:28:03,635
The O'Conners, however,
came up with the ingenious solution...

842
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,972
...of making the theme of their daughter
Alice's debutante party "Asphyxiation".

843
01:28:08,097 --> 01:28:12,018
Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.

844
01:28:13,144 --> 01:28:15,729
She'll give him a heart attack!

845
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,106
Hi, Parkie.

846
01:29:06,901 --> 01:29:09,529
Al's got the acting bug, you know.

847
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:13,657
She caught it from Pinkie.

848
01:29:14,533 --> 01:29:17,703
And I want to announce tonight
that next fall...

849
01:29:17,786 --> 01:29:21,123
...Alice is going to
a little school in New Haven

850
01:29:23,917 --> 01:29:27,170
I hear they have
a great drama school out there.

851
01:29:27,253 --> 01:29:31,465
- In fact, Sam, didn't your father build it?
- That's the law school.

852
01:29:33,217 --> 01:29:36,970
We're so proud of Alice.
We really couldn't be prouder.

853
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:47,438
I've had it.

854
01:29:47,438 --> 01:29:50,066
Goodbye, cruel world.

855
01:29:55,696 --> 01:29:58,490
No, no, no, you don't understand me!

856
01:29:58,574 --> 01:30:01,201
I'm a teenager. I got problems!

857
01:30:11,669 --> 01:30:14,588
So much has been said
about the girls over the years.

858
01:30:17,424 --> 01:30:20,010
But we have never found an answer.

859
01:30:22,637 --> 01:30:25,807
It didn't matter in the end
how old they had been,...

860
01:30:27,392 --> 01:30:30,019
...or that they were girls.

861
01:30:31,854 --> 01:30:34,732
But only that we had loved them,...

862
01:30:34,815 --> 01:30:37,401
...and that they hadn't heard us calling,...

863
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:41,530
...still do not hear us calling them
out of those rooms...

864
01:30:41,613 --> 01:30:44,574
...where they went to be alone
for all time,...

865
01:30:45,992 --> 01:30:50,371
...and where we will never find the pieces
to put them back together.

866
01:31:22,776 --> 01:31:27,030
<i>* I'm a high school lover</i>

867
