[exhales] I was in the storm sewer

40
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,254
You can get into anyone's house.

[narrator]
<i>So when Paul said this, we believed him</i>

42
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,301
<i>because he was the son
of Sammy "The Shark" Baldino,</i>

43

<i>and we knew about his escape tunnel
that led through the sewers.</i>

44

I know you're very strict,

Basically, what we have here
is a dreamer,

342
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,480
someone completely out of touch
with reality.

343
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:43,024
When she jumped,
she probably thought she was flying.

344
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,609
Here.

345
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,282
"Monday, February 13.
Today we had frozen pizza.

346
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,413
Thursday. Mom made
creamed corn for dinner.

347
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,331
It's the worst. It looks like —"

348
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,379
"Mary chipped her front tooth
on the monkey bars, acting like an idiot.

349
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:08,049
She made a big scene and had to go get
her tooth capped. It looks normal, I guess."

350
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,759
Here, give me that.

351
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,138
I told you she had a capped tooth.

352
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:22,564
Elm trees. How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

353
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,109
Here. Something about Dominic.

354
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:32,240
"Palazzolo jumped off the roof today
over that rich bitch Porter.

355
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,783
How stupid can you be?"

00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,247
"Today we went out on the boat.
It was pretty cold.

357
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,499
We saw a couple of whales.

358
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,437
Lux leaned over and stroked a whale.
I didn't think they would stink so much.

359
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,172
It's the kelp in their baleens rotting.

360
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,591
I hope we can go again sometime."

361
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,468
Hang on. Just read this. Read that.

362
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,553
- "Lux lost it over Kevin..."
- "Hines."

363
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,264
- Is it "Hines"? The garbage man.
- The garbage man.

[Cecilia] <i>Lux lost it over Kevin Heines,
the garbage man.</i>

365
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:03,730
<i>She'd wake up at 5:00 in the morning
and hang out casually on the front steps,</i>

366
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,857
<i>like it wasn't completely obvious.</i>

367
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,985
<i>She wrote his name in marker
on all her bras and underwear.</i>

368
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,529
<i>Mom found them
and bleached out all the Kevins.</i>

369
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,990
<i>Lux was crying on her bed all day.</i>

<i>My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair.</i>

373
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,347
[narrator] <i>And so we started
to learn about their lives...</i>

374
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,811
<i>coming to hold collective memories
of times we hadn't experienced.</i>

375
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,730
<i>We felt the imprisonment of being a girl,</i>

376
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,025
<i>the way it made your mind
active and dreamy</i>

377
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,696
<i>and how you ended up knowing
what colors went together.</i>

378
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,365
<i>We knew that the girls
were really women in disguise,</i>

379
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:58,285
<i>that they understood love
and even death,</i>

380
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:02,372
<i>and that our job was merely to create
the noise that seemed to fascinate them.</i>

381
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:07,127
<i>We knew that they knew
everything about us</i>

382
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,546
<i>and that we couldn't fathom them at all.</i>

383
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,603
Hi, uh, Mrs. Lisbon. I'm Lydia Perl.

384
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,480
I'm putting together a —

385
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,773
Oh.

386
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,984
Hi, I'm Bonnie. This is Mary.

387
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,652
Hello, girls.

388
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,491
Um, I'm here to ask you a couple
of questions, uh, about Cecilia.

389
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,286
Yeah?

390
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,912
Oh, great, great.

391
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:47,292
Um, maybe you could start by,
um, telling me a little bit about her.

392
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:52,047
Um, did she have
any special interests or hobbies?

393
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,550
Um, she liked to write
in her journal a lot.

394
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,260
That is great.

395
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,012
Um, okay.

396
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:03,266
Uh, did she — did she ever talk
about ending her life?

397
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,894
What's going on here?

398
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,355
Um, you must be Mrs. Lisbon.

399
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:11,316
I'm Lydia Perl.
I'm doing a piece for Channel 2 and —

400
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,401
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

401
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,156
<i>The suicide of an east-side teenager
last summer</i>

402
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:21,368
<i>has increased the awareness
of a national crisis.</i>

403
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,621
<i>I now stand in front of the home
where Cecilia Lisbon, a 13-year-old...</i>

<i>Psychologists agree
that adolescence today</i>

408
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:37,592

409
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:41,846
<i>More and more doctors say that
this frustration can lead to acts of violence</i>

410

<i>And we felt that

<i>we might begin to understand
what they were feeling and who they were.</i>

438
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,512
All right, so, if we have —

439
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,681
And these are Venn diagrams,
as you remember.

440
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:15,602
If we have A and B intersecting,

441
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,604
and A and B,

442
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,441
if A intersects B, we have this area.

443
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:25,695
And if A is the union with B,
we have all of the circle

444
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,196
plus the intersection.

445
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,535
These are the laws
of intersection and union. Okay?

446
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,089
How's it going?

447
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,301
Not bad.

448
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:56,934
Okay, do a character sketch on
the following characters from <i>Portrait of a Lady.</i>

449
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,854
The first one is... Ralph.

450
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:03,107
Um... he was nice.

451
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,485
It was really sad when he died.

452
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,948
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I just said that.

453
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,034
I am so sorry.

Reading about
the alarming suicide rate,

455
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:32,011
I talked to Mr. Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here

456
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,848
and realized that nothing
about this serious matter

457
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,434
has been discussed at this school.

458
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,813
[narrator] <i>And quickly thereafter,
green pamphlets were distributed.</i>

459
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:45,817
[woman] <i>We thought green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.</i>

460
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,944
<i>Certainly better than red.</i>

<i>Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?</i>

466
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,628
<i>Had they lost interest in school activities,
in sports and hobbies?</i>

467
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,172
<i>Had they withdrawn from their peers?</i>

468
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,051
Hi. I'm Chase.

469
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:16,347
I know who you are.

470
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:20,435
I've only been going to this school
my whole life.

471
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,563
You don't have to talk to me.

472
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:36,492
[man] So, for example, we have
two different types of economics,

473
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,786
or so-called two different types
of economics.

474
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,541
Now, the first one, we would say,
is called macroeconomics, which is...

00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,127
Look. She's laughing.

476
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,131
He made her laugh.

477
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,967
I never heard him
say anything remotely intelligent.

00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:57,555
[narrator] <i>The boys who talked with Lux
were always the stupidest boys</i>

Squeezebox. She's all right.

481
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:06,439
Let me tell you,
she's the hottest girl in the school, for sure.

482
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:10,401
You wanna know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

483
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,154
Nah, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

484
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,865
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what I mean.

485
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,661
[narrator] <i>But the only reliable boy
who actually got to know Lux...</i>

486
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,372
<i>was Trip Fontaine,</i>

675
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,498
like, all the other guys
are taking dates.

676
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,669
You're a good-looking fellow, Trip.
Lots of girls would go with you, I bet.

677
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:02,631
Yeah, well, I'm not interested
in lots of girls, sir.

678
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,849
I'll take it up with the wife, Trip,
do what I can.

679
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:16,103
Thank you, sir.

680
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:20,482
- It's a classic. It's really dark.
- Oh.

681
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,694
Mmm.

682
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,413
Uh, Trip Fontaine and, uh,
some of the other boys on the football squad

683
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,957
have asked to take the girls
to the homecoming dance.

684
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,502
- [gasping]
- You know how I feel about that sort of thing.

685
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:42,588
But, dear, I'm gonna be a chaperone
at the dance.

686
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:45,257
Oh, come on, Mom, please.

687
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:48,844
Your father and I will discuss it later.

688
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,141
Mr. Fontaine, may I speak with you, please?

689
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,936
[clears throat] Now, my wife and I
have, uh, had a little talk,

690
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,397
and we've come to a decision
about your request.

691
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,400
[no audible dialogue]

692
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,696
[Mr. Lisbon] Okay?

693
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:15,787
Yes!

694
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,293
- [exhales]
- [whistle blows]

695
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:23,420
Taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

696
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,505
All I need is three guys
to take the other girls.

697
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:27,424
[whistle blows]

698
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:35,307
I'll give you three joints, Trip.

699
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,934
Come on, Trip, man.
You pick me, we can take my dad's Caddie.

700
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,520
- [whistle blows]
- You gotta pick me, Tripster.

701
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:44,733
Trip, man, you owe me.

702
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,170
- I saved your ass with Woodhouse that time.
- [whistle blows]

703
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:49,488
- [screaming] Oh, thanks, Dad!
- Okay, okay, okay.

704
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,073
Who are the other boys?

705
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:54,451
Uh, let's see.
Parker Denton and Jake Conley.

706
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:58,455
He's a very good student, dear.
And, uh, uh, Kevin Head.

707
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:00,791
- Who's taking who?
- Whom.

708
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:02,834
They're just gonna raffle us off.

709

[narrator] <i>It didn't make any difference

- Yeah.

714
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:23,522
Okay, come on.

715
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:29,653
Oh, sorry. Okay, here we go.
Okay, come on. Together.

716
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,365
- There's a leak.
- And cheddar cheese.

717

718

731
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,504
Come in.

732
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,089
Thank you.

733
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:45,896
Uh, who — who's driving?

734
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:47,105
I am.

735
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:49,316
How long have you had your license?

736
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,959
Two months, but I had my learner's permit
for a year before that.

737
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:54,738
You know, we — we almost never
allow the girls to go out in cars

738
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,364
unless it's necessary.

739
00:51:56,448 --> 00:52:00,368
There's so many accidents nowadays.
I'm sure you will be very careful.

740
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:03,455
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Okay, third degree's over.

741
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,082
Girls!

742
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,504
I better get going.
I'll see you at the dance, huh?

743
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:12,547
- See you there, Mr. Lisbon.
- Okay.

744
00:52:12,631 --> 00:52:14,966
- Bye, dear.
- [chuckles]

745
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,219
- See you later.
- Yeah. Good.

746
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:23,558
Girls? Come on down.

747
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:25,977
The boys are here.

748
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,004
We got white ones.

749
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,674
We didn't know what you were wearing.

750
00:52:55,757 --> 00:53:00,387
The guy, the flower guy, said
that white would go with anything, so...

751
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:03,390
I'm glad you got white.

752
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,352
[Mrs. Lisbon] Why don't you pin them on?

753
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,648
Yeah.

754
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:14,484
Here.

755
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:19,823

- [laughing]
- Almost, almost.

758
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,263
- This isn't... gonna work.
- [chattering]

759
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,335
- Just — [chuckles]
- Popped off right away.

760
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:34,754
- Oh.
- [laughing]

761
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,965
There we go. All right.

762
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:39,718
- Let's do it.
- All right.

763
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,303
Bye, Mom.

764
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:43,263
Bye.

765
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:47,058
Hi.

766
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:55,233
Oh, my gosh. Look, you guys.
Her car's there late again.

767
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:57,861
[Bonnie] I'm sure Mr. Leo's
having an affair with the maid.

768
00:53:57,944 --> 00:54:00,280
I saw him follow her into the laundry room.

769
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:02,949
[Therese]
Ew! He's so fat, and that red nose.

770
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:05,744
- Totally an alcoholic.
- Yeah, and what about the Hessens?

771
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:08,997
- You know they're Nazis.
- They're Nazi sympathizers, Bonnie.

772
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,000
They had a fit when the Schwartzmans
tried to join the tennis club.

773
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,543
[laughing]

774
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,837
[Lux] Nice aluminum siding.

775
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,964
Do they really think that looks okay?

776
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:20,967
You know Mr. Kreigers
ordered that from TV late at night.

777
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:23,678
Look, it's the Baldinos' barbecue tree stump.

778
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:26,473
I have never seen them barbecue
on that thing.

779
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:29,601
Actually, it's an escape tunnel
for Sammy the Shark.

780
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,978
It leads to a river
where he keeps his speedboat.

781
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:34,230
Yeah,
I mean Paul goes down there all the time.

782
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:37,400
He can get into anyone's basement
through the storm sewers.

783
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:39,486
- No way.
- Yeah.

784
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:41,071
[Bonnie] Cool.

785
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,169
[Bonnie] Dad'll smell it on you.

786
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,129
No, I got mints.

787
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,840
He'll smell it on your clothes.

788
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:04,010
I'll just tell him some kids
were smoking in the bathroom.

789
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:08,264
Don't let it die a virgin.

790
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:10,934

- Yeah, grow up, Conley.

<i>Do you know where your children are?</i>

1181
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:08,646
<i>Bonnie, the youngest Lisbon sister,
strangely wore a 1920s wedding dress.</i>

<i>Therese Lisbon, a horse lover, had written
to the Brown University admissions office —</i>

<i>Yeah, Mary always wanted to be a cheerleader,

[Mrs. Lisbon]
<i>None of my daughters lacked for any love.</i>

1189
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,094
<i>There was plenty of love in our house.</i>

1190
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:44,057
<i>I never understood why.</i>

[narrator] <i>After the suicide free-for-all,</i>

01:26:18,258 --> 01:26:21,845
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon gave up
any attempt to lead a normal life.</i>

1194
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:27,016
<i>They had Mr. Headley pack up the house,</i>

1195
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,228
<i>selling what furniture he could
in a garage sale.</i>

1196
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:37,110
<i>Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market,
and it was sold to a young couple from Boston.</i>

1197
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:42,615
<i>We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.</i>

1198
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,662
<i>In the end, we had pieces of the puzzle,</i>

1199
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:50,665
<i>but no matter how we put them together,
gaps remained.</i>

1200
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:55,086
<i>Oddly shaped emptiness mapped
by what surrounded them.</i>

1201
01:26:55,169 --> 01:26:57,171
<i>Like countries we couldn't name.</i>

[clock ticking]

1203
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:03,177
<i>What lingered after them was not life...</i>

1204

<i>but the most trivial list of mundane facts.</i>

1205
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:12,228
<i>A clock ticking on the wall.</i>

1206
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:16,107
<i>A room dim at noon.</i>

1207
01:27:17,525 --> 01:27:21,738
<i>The outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.</i>

1208
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:30,204
<i>We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.</i>

[ticking continues]

1210
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,964
<i>Our parents seemed better able to do this,</i>

<i>returning to their tennis foursomes
and cocktail cruises</i>

1212
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:45,345
<i>as though they'd seen this all before.</i>

1213
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:49,766
<i>It was full-fledged summer again,</i>

1214
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:53,144
<i>over a year from the time
Cecilia had slit her wrists,</i>

1215
01:27:53,227 --> 01:27:55,229
<i>spreading the poison in the air.</i>

1216
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,858
<i>A spill at the plant increased
the phosphates in the lake</i>

1217
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:03,279
<i>and produced a scum of algae so thick
that the swamp smell filled the air,</i>

1218
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:05,573
<i>infiltrating the genteel mansions.</i>

1219
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,911
<i>Debutantes cried over the misfortune
of coming out in a season</i>

1220
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:12,497
<i>everyone would remember for its bad smell.</i>

1221
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:16,417
<i>The O'Connors, however,
came up with the ingenious solution</i>

1222
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:19,587
<i>of making the theme of their
daughter Alice's debutante party</i>

1223
01:28:19,671 --> 01:28:21,297
<i>asphyxiation.</i>

1224
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:26,302
<i>Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.</i>

Al's got the, uh, acting bug.

1229
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,697
She caught it from Pinkie.

1230
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,993
And I wanna announce tonight
that next fall,

1231
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:35,455
Alice is going to a little school
in New Haven.

1232
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:41,461
I hear they have a great drama school.

1233
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:44,380
In fact, Sam,
I think your father built it, didn't he?

1234
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:47,550
- [Sam] That's the law school.
- [chuckling]

1235
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:50,636
We're so proud of Alice.
We really couldn't be prouder.

1236
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,639
- [woman] Aw. Cheers.
- [crowd] Cheers.

1237
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:01,689
I've had it.

1238
01:30:01,773 --> 01:30:04,025
Good-bye, cruel world.

1239
01:30:10,198 --> 01:30:13,034
No, no, no. You don't understand me.

1240
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:15,453
I'm a teenager. I got problems.

1241
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:18,331
[laughter]

1242
01:30:26,798 --> 01:30:29,967
<i>So much has been said
about the girls over the years...</i>

1243
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:33,930
<i>but we have never found an answer.</i>

1244
01:30:36,974 --> 01:30:39,268
<i>It didn't matter in the end
how old they had been...</i>

1245

[lighter flicking]

1246
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:43,523
<i>or that they were girls.</i>

1247
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:48,444
<i>But only that we had loved them...</i>

1248
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:51,697
<i>and that they hadn't heard us calling,</i>

1249
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:54,909
<i>still do not hear us calling them
out of those rooms...</i>

1250
01:30:56,077 --> 01:30:58,704
<i>where they went to be alone for all time...</i>

1251
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:04,210
<i>and where we will never find the pieces
to put them back together.</i>
