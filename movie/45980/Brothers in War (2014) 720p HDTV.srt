4
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:16,348
    Bill Reynolds: They took
   us into some harsh terrain,

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,518
     in nasty rotten places.

6
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,621
          And the more
       that we patrolled,

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,459
        the more we made
     contact with the enemy.

8

      we were pretty tough,

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,165
    but when you get so many
     guys killed or wounded,

10
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,702

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,180
     we could see the water
  splashing all over the place.

14

          Steve Hopper:
    You can smell the blood,

15
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,918
  you can smell the explosions.

16
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,755

     I hadn't travelled far

      Being from the South,

38
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,305
        I was accustomed
        to two Americas,

39
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,274
         a white America
      and a black America.

40
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,010
      And this was being my
  first integration situation.

41
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,012
           I was more
       nervous about that,

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,549
           than I was
       about the training.

43
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,154
          Larry Lilley:
     We all had a job to do,

44
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,090
   so we worked well together.

45
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,126
        It was a blending
    that made us all better.

46
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,997

48
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,437
        We had one of our
      guys, Terry McBride,

49
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,007
          he had ridden
     with the Hells Angels.

50
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:59,111
         He was kind of
      a bad dude, you know.

51
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,613
         Terry McBride:
   I'm not going to say I had

52
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,448
    a problem with authority,

53
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,717
       I think they had a
    problem with me because I

54
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,886
         didn't want to
      fit in their mold and

55
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,488
  I didn't mind vocalizing it.

    was the biggest jokester

58
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,395
          in the group.

59
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,498
       John Sclimenti: So,
     when I was in Vietnam,

60
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,767
     this is what happened.

61
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,569
        Larry Lilley: You
        might be asleep,

62
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,070
       he'd fill your hand
     full of whip cream and

63
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,606
         tickle and your
    nose until you went "ah,"

64
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,341
         everybody busts
          out laughing!

65
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,844
     Richard Rubio: We were
    goofing off all the time,

66
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:38,083
   always getting in trouble,
    and we had a lot of fun.

67
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,852
     Terry McBride: I never
    knew that a bunch of guys

68
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,158
     could get as tied as we
 did in a short period of time.

69
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,029
     Larry Lilley: One day,
    we were part way through

70
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,433
        training and Don
    Peterson is screwing up.

71
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,669
       He's joking around
   and having a good time and

72
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,472
      the drill instructor
    is not happy about that.

73
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,642
         So he yells for
    Peterson, "Get up here!"

74
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,011
     And the drill sergeant
      says, "On your back,

75
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,313
        hands and legs in
       the air and scream.

76
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,583
     'I'm a bug' til we are
     done with our workout."

77
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,453
        So for 45 minutes
        Don was screaming

78
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,789
     "I'm a bug, I'm a bug!"

79
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,293
         And when PT was
        over he was Bug.

80
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:26,698
     From then on he wasn't
    Don Peterson he was Bug!

88
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,627

106

       President Johnson:
       We face more cost,

107
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,649
    more loss and more agony.

108
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,454
          Steve Hopper:
       In December of '66,

109
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,324
   we had finished all of our
   training and declared to be

110
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,427
     ready to go to Vietnam,
  but all of us got to go home

111
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,632
  for Christmas and home leave,
  so to speak, before we left.

112
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,573
    Bill Reynolds: I remember
      coming home and just

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,043
     seeing my mom and dad,
     my brother and sister,

114
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,581
             and my
      girlfriend was there.

115
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,117
       And you know my mom
      was upset, you know,

116
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,820
         she was worried
         about Vietnam.

117
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,057
         And I was just
    upset to be leaving home.

118
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,495
         I wasn't really
       in fear of my life.

119
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,730
   Terry McBride: I had a lot
   of my cousins and aunts and

120
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,133
        uncles that were
      saying goodbye to me.

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,537
   And I could see by the look
  in some of their eyes that it

122
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,974
   was probably the last time
   they were going to see me.

123
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,510
      The whole thing sent
      a shiver up my back.

124
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,278
        And I just said,

125
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,548
    "Wait a second, how about
     everybody just tell me,

126
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,750
      I'll see you later."

127
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,020
       And I've always had
     a problem with goodbye.

128
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,290
          To me it just
        sounds too final.

129
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,730
       Steve Hopper: So I
    flew back to Illinois and

130
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:16,968
   first thing I did was went
  out and bought an engagement

131
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:23,508
      ring because I wanted
   the girl that I was dating,

132
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:33,552
      I guess to give me a
  real purpose for coming home.

139
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,847
           John Young:
       I wanted to serve.

140
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:07,118
   My father and all my uncles
 were World War II veterans and

141
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:13,425
    it seemed to me that this
was simply my generation's turn.

142
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,596
    Jack Benedick: We figured
 within a year the war would be

143
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,315
            over with
       once we got there.

144
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,870
  That sounds a little, maybe,
   unrealistic to some people.

145
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:30,642
   But the training we had at
   Fort Riley instilled in our

146
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,646
     unit this will to win,
      that we were going to

147
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:39,284
        take care of this
    war and get it over with.

148
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:48,059
   Richard Rubio: It was like
  the old World War II movies.

149
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:54,132
       Passing underneath
     the Golden Gate Bridge.

150
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,703
     We had a lot of pride.

151
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,973
     Reporter: Nicknamed the
    "old reliables" for their

152
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,743
    distinguished performance
        in World War II,

153
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,646
     the crack 9th Division
   will add an important plus

154
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,916
        to US operations,
 and raise total troop strength

155
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:15,854
          in Vietnam to
     another all time high.

156
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,731
     Gary Maibach: The next
   morning when we woke up it

157
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,867
       wasn't what I would
      call rough sea but it

158
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,036
        was rough enough.

159
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:35,273
  Bill Reynolds: That ship was
  not like cruise ships today.

160
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,709
        These things were
   jolting all over the place

161
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,445
   and swaying back and forth.

162
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,614
       I look back now and
    I can laugh about it but

163
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:47,185
        at the time, man,
    it was pretty miserable.

164
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,989
    Steve Hopper: Then there
    were days that the water

165
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,924
       was just beautiful.

166
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,161
     Just as smooth as glass
    and you'd enjoy your days

167
00:09:56,228 --> 00:10:00,832
      out on the top deck.

168
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,571
     There's a lot of things
     going through your mind

169
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,940
       before you actually
       enter a combat zone

170
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,842
      as to whether or not,
   what your capabilities are.

171
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,078
        Regardless of the
      training you've had,

172
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,681
          everybody has
       a soul about them.

173
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,219
         John Bradfield:
   The Red Cross gave us some

174
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:26,257
    pamphlets and things that
   dealt with our conscience,

175
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:31,129
    because we were actually
  going to have to kill to keep

176
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,131
       from being killed.

177
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,936
          That was just
       the reality of it.

178
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,077
    Gary Maibach: When we got
  closer to Vung Tau you could

179
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:50,682
  see the coastline of Vietnam.

180
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,685
        Shoreline with a
    beautiful beach, I mean,

181
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,354
       it looked more like
     somewhere you'd want to

182
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,959
      take a vacation than
   you'd want to fight a war.

183
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,895
          Steve Hopper:
    We were out on the deck,

184
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,365
    just talking and looking,
    and you'd see a stream of

185
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:14,305
   tracers off in the distance
 coming down from a helicopter.

186
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,308
          And all of a
       sudden you realize,

187
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:22,247
        Wow, there's some
      stuff going on here.

188
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,485
      Bill Reynolds: We had
    to gather all of our gear

189
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,955
   and get ready to disembark
    from the troop ship onto

190
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,624
         a smaller boat,

191
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,628
      a landing craft that
    was to take us to shore.

192
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,868
            You know,
      it was kind of scary,

193
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,671
         we didn't know
         what to expect.

194
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,011
    John Bradfield: The gate
  came down and we came ashore,

195
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,981
      and we're all looking
      around for the enemy,

196
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,651
      and all we could see
     was American personnel.

197
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:07,092
     What we found out was,
  that it was a reception area.

198
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,694
         Bill Reynolds:
   They immediately loaded us

199
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,131
  on deuce-and-a-halfs and all
  of a sudden we find ourselves

200
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,869
  busting down this dirt road,
     dust flying everywhere.

201
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,642
  John Sclimenti: We're driving
    through and we could see

202
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,513
      these little houses,
   people were working and the

203
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:33,118
     animals that they were
 using to plough the fields with

204
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:38,089
      and the bicycles and
   the little motor scooters.

205
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,295
          Gary Maibach:
    The sites and the sounds

206
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:51,136
   and the smells of a totally
   different land and culture.

207
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:55,690
            It had a
      surreal aspect to it.

208
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,885
       Herb Lind: And they
  trucked us to Camp Bear Cat,

209
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,454
        which was the 9th
   Infantry Division base camp

210
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,022
          at that time.

211
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,624
          Gary Maibach:
       And there we were.

212
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,726
            No tents,
      no cots, no nothing.

213
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,196
    Welcome to Vietnam, guys!

214
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,967
       Bill Reynolds: They
    had us digging trenches,

215
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,870
        filling sandbags,
  we were instantly working our

216
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:29,007
          tails off to
      build our base camp.

217
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,278
          John Hoskins:
       Hello mom and dad.

218
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,180
    Here I am safe and sound
     at the scenic Bear Cat,

219
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:41,786
    Republic of Vietnam, the
    armpit of southeast Asia.

220
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,023
    Right now I'm sitting in
   my tent eating two brownies

221
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,625
       which were sent by
   Lieutenant Benedick's wife.

222
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,894
    Now I know you don't know
   who in the hell Lieutenant

223
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,447
   Benedick is, but that's him
   laughing in the background.

224
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,966
       <i> [Benedick laughs].</i>

225
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,272
     The Republic of Vietnam
     is not one of the most

226
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,908
      sought after vacation
       spots in the world.

227
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,178
       The curfew here at
   night is from 7:00 at night

228
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,347
           until 7:00
         in the morning,

229
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,616
     and during that time no
    Vietnamese are allowed to

230
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,918
      leave their villages
     or travel on the roads.

231
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,471
     And any Vietnamese you
   find travelling at night is

232
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,957
      considered Viet Cong,
      and you're authorized

233
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,427
          to kill them.

239
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,884
      Terry McBride: It was
    like going to junior high

240
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:47,685
       before high school.

241
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:49,854
     You were getting broke
  in on what it's gonna be and

242
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,489
       how it's gonna be.

243
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,058
    Now you got to realize is
   how to put all the training

244
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,928
     that we had already got
 into a focal point to where it

245
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,131
    made sense that you were
    gonna actually go out and

246
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,133
    attempt to kill somebody
    while they're attempting

247
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:06,004
          to kill you.

248
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,373

     At this time last year,

249
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,610
       there were 190,000
  U.S. troops in South Vietnam.

250
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,113
     Now there are 415,000.

251
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,015
    That build-up has changed
   the nature of the war that

252
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,285
           U.S. forces
       are able to fight.

  South Vietnam is divided into

255
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,093
     American troops do most
  or all of the fighting in the

             will be
     deployed in the Delta.

262
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,412
    The terrain is difficult
  and the South Vietnamese army

263

          has had only

00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:04,398
   National Liberation Front,

00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:18,379
      they're rice farmers.

298
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,555
  John Sclimenti: We walked up
  onto a school one time where

299
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:32,627
    they were teaching people
     how to be a Viet Cong.

300
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:37,298
      They had these things
  that would show booby traps.

301
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,300
        There would be a
    punji pit and they would

302
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,868
     show you the punji pit.

303
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,838
     Or you would walk into
  one of the rooms and they had

304
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:47,875
    a large chalkboard with a
   machine gun or an AK-47 up

305
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:51,579
    there with little arrows
 and writing all over the place.

306
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:56,284
          And that was
        very, very eerie.

307
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:00,488
     Terry McBride: Wherever
   we went it seemed like you

308
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,591
      always had an eyeball
    on the back of your head.

309
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:08,329
    You always felt watched.

310
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:12,366
        It would be like,
   them coming to my backyard

311
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,402
      and wanting to play.

312
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:17,004
        We were in their
  backyard and they definitely

313
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:21,209
         wanted to play.

314
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:27,849
     Steve Hopper: The enemy
  was an expert in camouflage.

315
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:34,422
        You could be out
   on a mission and things go

316
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:38,125
        south real quick.

317
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,931
    We had a couple guys fall
into some punji traps, you know,

318
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,434
       hidden underground
     and they step on it and

319
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,970
         they went down
     into the hole and these

320
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:53,307
       punji sticks would
      penetrate their leg.

321
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,612
         John Sclimenti:
      You could not get the

322
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,147
           feeling how
         scary that was,

323
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:02,884
       because you didn't
    even know where to step,

324
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:06,153
         where to kneel.

325
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,956
    John Young: You're always
     angry and you're always

326
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,525
    scared because you think
    that could have been me,

327
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:14,862
      just as well as him.

328
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,933
    And that's the bad thing
  about mines and booby traps.

329
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:23,337
       You suffer and you
     can't do any harm back

330
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:26,807
       against the enemy.

331
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:31,245
       And that builds up
   inside soldiers to a level,

332
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:36,817
       at which something
       is going to happen.

333
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,992
         Terry McBride:
   We were on board the ships,

334
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,964
  the big boats, and they told
  us we had a mission the next

335
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:53,935
   day to make sure all of our
   weapons were clean and that

336
00:20:54,002 --> 00:21:01,008
  we'd be out the door at about
  3:30 or 4:00 in the morning.

  are broken down into platoons

360
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,187

362
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,207
      the platoons are sent
     into the bush to search

363
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,009
       for the Communists.

364
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:44,595
     The Viet Cong refuse to
   fight bigger American units

365
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:46,714
         unless they are
       taken by surprise.

366
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,717
    So, the idea is to entice
    the Communists to jump an

367
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,486
       outnumbered platoon
  then rush in reinforcements,

368
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:54,722
       artillery barrages
    and air strikes when the

370
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:02,263

   crossed a rather large rice

00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:46,440

00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,027
         John Sclimenti:
   One of the sergeants says,

399
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:42,429
        "Hey we need some
   volunteers to go out there

400
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:44,198
      and get these guys."

401
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:47,668
      I don't think anybody
    had to sit there and say,

402
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,603
         "Hey I'm gonna
        be a volunteer."

403
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:54,074
    I think what happened is
  this group that was trained,

404
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:57,178
     and knew their brothers
       were out there just

405
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,246
     took it upon themself.

406
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:03,317
      And people would just
   jump up and we off and ran.

407
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:09,757
   John Young: I was running,
    and running, and running,

408
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:12,760
         and finally off
    to my right, there was a

409
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:15,529
        G.I. lying there.

410
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,198
             I said,
    "This is sergeant Young,"

411
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,466
        I said, "I'm here
       to take you back."

412
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:22,203
        And he said, "ok"
     he said, "but" he said,

413
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,838
     "I can't move my legs."

414
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:27,708
     And so I lay down flat
    in the rice, and I said,

415
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,643
         "Can you crawl
         up on my back,

416
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,812
          can you pull
   yourself up onto my back?"

417
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,481
   And he was able to do that.

418
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:36,784
       And I got up on my
   hands and knees and started

419
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:40,387
          crawling back
      towards the platoon.

420
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:43,991
        And I finally got
 back to where the men who were

421
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:47,027
     still back at the rice
    paddy dike could see us.

422
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:52,366
     John Sclimenti saw me,
   and he came running out to

423
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:56,837
       help me get him the
      last few meters back.

   Steve Hopper: It's amazing
   how chaotic things are one

433
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:36,337
     moment and then at some
  point the last shot is fired

     When you're in battle,

00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:45,746
    your training takes over,

437
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:49,316
          your emotions
       are on auto-pilot.

438
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:54,521
      What's tough for you
    is when the battle stops.

439
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:59,026
     When the battle stops,
    all of a sudden you start

440
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:05,132
         thinking about,
  "What coulda happened to me?"

441
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,237
      Steve Hopper: And the
    enemy has either fled or

442
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:13,006
        they were killed.

443
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:15,809
       And you're talking,
       you're cleaning up.

444
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:18,612
   And, as we did in Vietnam,

445
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,882
   we did a head-count on how
   many enemy had been killed.

446
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,487
           That was a
       measure of success.

447
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,158
       John Young: And we
   knew for sure by then that

448
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:35,596
     Don Peterson was dead.

449
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:39,299
    And two of the men in our
  platoon who were good friends

450
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,536
     of Don Peterson's were
     able to go out there in

451
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:47,341
        the rice and find
       him, find his body,

452
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:52,846
       and carry him back
    to the platoon positions.

453
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:02,389
    James Nall: Emotionally,
    it really hurt me 'cause

454
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:06,960
        I had never in my
      life seen a guy die,

455
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:11,432
      until Peterson died.

456
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:17,070
     Gary Maibach: Don was,
     was one of those people

457
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:22,342
      who was the glue that
     held the unit together.

458
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:27,898
      He was going home but
  not the way I wanted him to.

459
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:34,655
       Bill Reynolds: They
   had a poncho covering him,

460
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:39,793
   and the chopper lifted off,
  and we were barely airborne,

461
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:44,665
         and that poncho
    flew right out the door.

462
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,634
   It was just looking at him,

463
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,270
           seeing him
      dead there was just,

464
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:53,941
        God, it was like,
         "This is real."

465
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:58,278
         And I thought,
      if they can get Pete,

466
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:03,050
    we got a lot of problems.

00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:56,036
         But I doubt if
        anyone back home,

478
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:00,941
     other than maybe Don's
   family and Don was married,

479
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:03,944
     heard much about that.

480
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,680
    Bill Reynolds: And it was
  kind of hard to get your head

481
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:09,850
      wrapped around that;
   how frightful the situation

482
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:15,155
     we were in and how back
home it was "A day in the life."

483
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,901
        And that was the
   beginning of what was to be

484
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:32,406
           some pretty
      gruesome days ahead.

485
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,952
   Ron Nessen: Since I've been
   home from Vietnam dozens of

486
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,123
      people have asked me
 "What's really going on there?"

487
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,026
      If these questioners
       are representative,

488
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,461
     it indicates that many
    Americans are confused by

489
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:16,733
    conflicting reports about
    the situation in Vietnam.

490
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:20,304
    The success in Washington
 is measured in cold statistics,

491
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,706
          the number of
        Viet Cong killed,

492
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:28,045
   the number of pacification
        cadres graduated.

493
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,549
       In Vietnam, success
    is persuading one old man

494
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,484
     to point out where the
     communists have hidden

495
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,520
         the booby trap.

496
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,356
      It is talking one old
    woman into luring her son

497
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,410
    away from the Viet Cong.

498
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,500
     Steve Hopper: You could
   walk through a village and

499
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:55,172
      people were friendly,
  but yet you were walking down

500
00:32:55,239 --> 00:33:00,143
     a very well-beaten path
    within their village and

501
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,380
    one of your guys steps on
   a land mine or a booby trap

502
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,617
          or they trip
         a hand grenade.

503
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:14,858
    And it really caused you
  to doubt how much the people

504
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,463
      were with us because
  they had to know those things

505
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,467
         were in place.

506
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,803
     John Sclimenti: We got
    orders to go through and

507
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:30,207
    find their food and these
     guys had big, big, big,

508
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:36,480
      piles of rice and we
    got orders to destroy it.

509
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:40,584
     Now these people worked
   their butt off to do this,

510
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,854
          I mean these
       guys were peasants.

511
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,224
    And the Viet Cong used to
   come by and take that stuff

512
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:52,029
       from them to supply
     their armies and stuff.

513
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:56,266
        And here we were
    supposed to make friends

514
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,201
       with these people.

515
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,670
      Well, I can tell you
  right now these guys weren't

516
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:05,509
    real happy after we left.

517
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,812
     John Young: I think the
  great majority of the people

518
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,415
      of the Delta were in
   the really sad situation of

519
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,583
   being caught in the middle.

520
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,520
       If they cooperated
        too much with us,

521
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:20,857
     it would cost them when
   the VC showed up at night.

522
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,361
     And if they cooperated
      too much with the VC,

523
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,563
           then if we
       found out about it,

524
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,632
        we were going to
      make it hard on them.

525
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,503
   So no matter what they did,
    they were going to lose.

526
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,541
  Steve Hopper: Our salvation,
     and I think the way we

527
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,877
     maintained our sanity,
      that helped us a bit,

528
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,514
   was going back to the ship.

529
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,721
     It was a real treat to
   get back from a patrol and

530
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,357
     you've been in water up
   to your hips or up to your

531
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:58,562
      shoulders for 3 or 4
   days and you've got a nice

532
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,832
      air conditioned clean
      shower to go to spend

533
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,035
      a couple of days off.

534
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,271
        Larry Lilley: It
     was time to regenerate,

535
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,808
  and part of that regeneration
   was reading mail from home.

536
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,710
         John Sclimenti:
    Mail call was a big deal.

537
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,514
     And people used to get
   care packages all the time.

538
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,783
    Now, one of the guys who
   used to have the best care

539
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,352
   packages was Larry Lilley.

540
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,255
   Larry Lilley: I had a wife
  and a sister-in-law that sent

541
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,457
     me boxes of cookies and
   popcorn and when I got that

542
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,292
   stuff everybody was happy.

543
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,897
     Everybody got cookies,
   everybody got the popcorn.

550
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,093
         Terry McBride:
   We were cruising along and

551
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,095
       I remember talking
     to Hoskins and I said,

552
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,731
      "John, so what is it
    that we're going after?"

553
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,534
  and he said, "Mack, he said,
   this is going to be a day."

554
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:15,305
       He said, "Its going
      to be a helluva day."

555
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:19,176
   And then I started looking
   around and there was women

556
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,144
    that were grabbing their
   kids and were pulling them

557
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:25,615
       into their hooches
       as we are going by.

558
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:31,121
      It's like, it was an
     omen that something was

559
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,325
        going to happen.

560
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,102
       John Sclimenti: We
    were sweeping an area and

561
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,972
       all of a sudden the
     radios just went crazy.

562
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,274
            You could
       hear them all over.

00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,977
   <i> [inaudible radio chatter]</i>

564
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,380
   Herb Lind: We received word
  that our sister battalion had

565
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,584
      made some contact in
    an area south of where we

566
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,053
        had started out.

567
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,122
     So my company received
   orders from battalion that

568
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,626
   we were going to be picked
  up again by the ATCs that we

569
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,629
     had been inserted with
   earlier and would be moved

570
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:16,399
        to another area.

571
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,736
    What I'm attempting to do
 is draw out what the battle of

572
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:25,108
   19 June looked like from my
  perspective and where I was,

573
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,744
        where the company
        was at the time.

574
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:34,784
      So we were picked up,
   up here, put on the boats,

575
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:39,856
      brought down here and
     reinserted right here.

576
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:44,461
      We believed that the
   enemy was to the south and

577
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:47,197
     there would be another
     American unit coming up

578
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,099
         from the south.

579
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:53,003
        We were going to
   catch them out in the open.

580
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,875
         So we unloaded
        off of our ATCs,

581
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,544
     my first platoon on the
   right my second platoon in

582
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,181
        the middle and my
   third platoon on the left.

583
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,717
     John Young: And we were
   headed off in the direction

584
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:14,457
  of sort of a scattered group
    of hooches and from just

585
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:20,196
  across the canal a 50-caliber
     machine gun opened up!

586
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,443
    Herb Lind: I had not left
   the vicinity of the boats.

587
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,979
          Lt. Benedick,
    my second platoon leader,

588
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,749
      screamed on the radio
     "We're hit, we're hit!"

589
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,087
         Jack Benedick:
    We had 15 or 16 guys hit

590
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,556
          when the fire
         first started.

591
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:50,694
      They were definitely
         waiting for us.

592
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,863
     Richard Rubio: I could
    tell it was total chaos.

593
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:58,234
      Because everyone was
  getting hit at the same time.

594
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,205
         Bill Reynolds:
      And so there we were,

595
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:06,543
   trying to figure out where
    in the hell is the enemy?

596
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:13,249
       Herb Lind: What we
   discovered was that the VC

597
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,753
        were not south of
    us but were north of us.

598
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,156
       There was a machine
        gun bunker here,

599
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,294
    and a machine gun bunker
   here and another one here.

600
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,730
       Our best estimation
      was that it had to be

601
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,833
      at least a battalion
      sized unit or larger,

602
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:36,005
   and that would be Viet Cong
  approximately 400 to 500 men.

603
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:40,677
  And our strength at that time
  would have been right at 120.

604
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:45,181
        John Young: We're
     up against a seriously

605
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:48,651
     over-sized enemy unit.

606
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,955
           We were out
     numbered on the ground.

614
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:25,405
  Herb Lind: Once we identified
   where the main machine gun

615
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:29,275
    fire was coming from, we
 pretty much could pin it down,

616
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,145
       but we didn't have
    anything large enough to

617
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:35,548
       destroy the bunkers
    that the VC had built up.

618
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:40,987
     We determined we had to
   call in heavier artillery.

   one of the helicopters just

644
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:46,012
         turns and comes
     back around and lands.

645
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:49,249
        Gary Maibach: The
    first medevac came in and

646
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:54,120
    I was helping a couple of
   guys up into the helicopter

647
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:59,158
  when the door gunner started
   firing right over my head.

648
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:02,528
       Bill Reynolds: That
  chopper started to lift off,

649
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:05,298
      and BAM I could see a
  blast through the windshield

650
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,367
          and the pilot
      grabbed his shoulder.

651
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:09,335
  That chopper set right down,

652
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:11,638
      the rear rotor swung
        and that chopper

653
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:14,140
     wasn't going anywhere.

654
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:18,511
          Gary Maibach:
  A second helicopter came in,

655
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:22,282
    and we were able to load
     some of the casualties

          on that one.

657

00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:47,907
       around and swinging
        around like this.

662
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:50,243
         Willie McTear:
     And it swayed this way,

663
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:52,245
     and it swayed that way.

664

   up and then came back over.

      and right smack down.

666

   about 5 or 6 guys in there.

   It came back down on them.

   Bill Reynolds: Seeing that
    chopper go down was just,

675

676
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:43,830
      lieutenant commander
       named Dusty Rhodes.

677
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:47,800
        He had what they
    called a monitor gunboat.

678
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:51,537
        Dusty Rhodes knew
    that we were in trouble.

679
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,906
        He says, "I know
      that canal," he says,

680
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:58,945
   "It's high tide right now,
   I think I can make it up."

681
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,781
        John Young: If he
       goes up the canal,

682
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:03,850
         he's gonna have
        to back it down,

683
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:06,386
        cause there isn't
     nearly enough room for

       it to turn around.

685
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:11,124
    And if the tide gets down
  too far while he's up there,

686
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:13,493
      he could be grounded.

687
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,395
  Herb Lind: There was a risk,

688
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,130
      a very definite risk,

689
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:20,166
     but what options do we
 have in a situation like that?

690
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,569
       We tried artillery,
        we tried the air.

691
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,571
      I would have welcomed
        anything that day

692
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,173
         to help us out.

693
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:30,743
      And Dusty Rhodes was
    willing to take the risk.

694
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:33,279
        One of the things
    he needed was somebody to

695
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:35,615
        direct his fire.

696
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:39,786
      And when he came in,
      I said I would do it.

697
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:44,991
    John Young: Captain Lind,
     carrying his own radio,

698
00:45:45,058 --> 00:45:48,494
       stood up and walked
     alongside that monitor,

699
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:57,837
        selecting targets
        for it to engage.

700
00:45:57,905 --> 00:46:00,940
       I remember looking
    up there and seeing him,

701
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,975
         and I thought,
      "If I've ever seen a

702
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:08,281
      brave man in my life
    there he is right there."

703
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:13,419
    Herb Lind: He backed out
  before the tide came back in,

704
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:15,721
         and that really
    alleviated the situation

705
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:18,257
      for Charlie Company.

706
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:23,296
        So, Dusty Rhodes
        is a hero to me.

    we approached our boats,

717
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,832

and it was our company commander

718
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,003
       and he says, "We're
   assaulting the other side."

719
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,406
         And I thought,
    "After what we've already

00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:10,810
   done and already happened?"

721
00:47:10,878 --> 00:47:15,448
    As we boarded that boat,

       last day on Earth.

724
00:47:39,506 --> 00:47:43,175
     John Sclimenti: We all
   got on line and we started

725
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:49,282
        rushing the fire,
      everybody's shooting,

726
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,451
      automatics are going.

727
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:55,521
     John Young: We were all
 advancing as fast as we could,

728
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:58,291
       and firing weapons
      as fast as we could.

729
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,193
         I think at that
     moment we all just went

730
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:05,364
       a little bit crazy.

731
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:11,871
        I'm not sure how
      many we got and then,

732
00:48:11,939 --> 00:48:15,808
      almost that quickly,
        it was just over.

733
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:26,552
   Herb Lind: We didn't really
  know at that time how many we

734
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,890
      had killed or how bad
      we had crippled them.

735
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:35,127
     And by that time it was
   starting to get dark and so

736
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:38,998
   we pulled back and between
    myself and the battalion

737
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:41,500
  commander we decided that we
   better go into a defensive

738
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:46,238
     posture for the night.

739
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:48,574

   idea if they were going to

740
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:53,245
        assault us again,
      how many were there.

741
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:57,283
       We had no idea what
      was going to happen.

742
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,496
     Herb Lind: The next day
    we were primed and ready.

743
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:12,798
     We thought we probably
     were going to have more

744
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,834
         battle to face.

745
00:49:14,901 --> 00:49:17,503
   And we eased up and started
   to try to move forward and

746
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:19,472
     received no resistance,

747
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,608
         no shots fired
       at us what so ever.

748
00:49:22,676 --> 00:49:27,647
        So eventually we
     got up and spread out.

749
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,550
     Then we discovered that
  during the hours of darkness

750
00:49:31,618 --> 00:49:35,738
      the enemy retreated.

        I miss Kenny and
       I miss Timmy today.

794
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:48,654
     I think of them often.

801
00:52:09,176 --> 00:52:13,479
    Herb Lind: Our A company
   came down through here and

802
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:17,650
    got caught in this ambush
  with machine guns here, here,

803
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:21,453
   and here which is a classic
    thing that we dreaded in

804
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:24,623
  Vietnam, an L-shaped ambush.

805
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:28,527
    When those people got in
here this machinegun swept them,

806
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:31,230
  this machinegun was sweeping
  them and this machinegun was

807
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:35,634
      sweeping them and the
    kill zone is tremendous.

808
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,137
        The reports were
       that A Company took

809
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:42,575
      about 80% casualties.

  <i> Narrator: With Alpha Company</i>

     <i> to recover the bodies.</i>

813
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:57,623
      Gary Maibach: When we
   broke through the tree line

814
00:52:57,691 --> 00:53:03,295
         we came on what
     was left of A Company.

815
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:07,600
           <i> [exhales].</i>

816
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:15,007
         Well, there was
       just nothing left.

817
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:18,777
         They were dead
    where they had been hit;

818
00:53:18,845 --> 00:53:23,616
       they were literally
     yards from Charlie when

819
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:27,119
          he opened up.

820
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:31,624
     John Sclimenti: One of
  the things that struck me the

821
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:34,827
   most is that I would find a
   body and their helmet would

822
00:53:34,895 --> 00:53:37,763
    be off their head and it
   would be laying beside them

823
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:40,933
  and there would be a picture
  of their girlfriend or their

824
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:45,404
      wife or their family
      inside their helmets.

825
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,775
    And that stuck me because
   in my mind I was picking up

826
00:53:49,843 --> 00:53:53,479
    a soldier, but then when
    I saw the helmet with the

827
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:56,649
      pictures inside I was
   picking up a family member,

828
00:53:56,716 --> 00:54:01,820
            a father,
     or a brother, or a son.

829
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:17,169
     Larry Lilley: That day
    was body bags and bodies.

830
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:29,381
         It was just the
     ugliest day of my life.

831
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,529
         Bill Reynolds:
       Several days later,

832
00:54:43,596 --> 00:54:46,732
   one of the guys got in the
   mail the front page of the

833
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,502
  L.A. Times where it reported
   that an entire company was

834
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,972
   wiped out by the Viet Cong.

835
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,076
        Not once did they
  mention we had killed 250 VC.

836
00:54:57,143 --> 00:54:59,678
     Not once did it say at
    the end of the battle we

837
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:02,648
         were there and
     they were gone or dead.

838
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:06,452
     And, you know, I think
    that was kind of like an

839
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:12,424
         eye opener that
     America is not with us.

840
00:55:14,194 --> 00:55:16,962
  Rollin Post: This was the day
  Women for Peace chose to make

841
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:22,167
      their annual visit to
   protest the war in Vietnam.

842
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:25,804
      Edwin Newman: Public
 opinion polls indicate that the

843
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:28,440
      dissenters are in the
  minority but their number is

844
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:32,411
  growing and they are starting
  to take more positive action.

845
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:35,514
   Herb Lind: People read what
   the news media fed them and

846
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:39,018
   people believed news media,
   and news media concentrated

847
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:43,655
         at that time on
      what was sensational.

848
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:47,226
   If you were a newspaper man
  and you wanted to make a name

849
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:50,763
  for yourself, you concentrate
  on getting those hot flashes

850
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:54,199
    of the bad situations, or
    the negative situations,

851
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,669
    to the degree that to me
   it seemed they left out the

852
00:55:57,737 --> 00:56:02,207
    parts that explained why
   or what really did happen.

853
00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:06,845
  Frank McGee: Right or wrong,
    for better or for worse,

854
00:56:06,913 --> 00:56:10,616
       never have so many
  Americans had so many doubts,

855
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:13,886
         and never have
      we been less united.

856
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:18,223
    This attitude is not lost
on the men who fight in Vietnam.

857
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:22,494
    But for them, as for all
   men who fight in all wars,

858
00:56:22,562 --> 00:56:27,766
  there is only one meaningful
     reality, life or death.

859
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:32,571
    Willie McTear: It was all
  about us doing for each other

860
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:35,541
       what we couldn't do
      alone for ourselves.

861
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:39,244
        We were trying to
    keep each other safe and

862
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:42,047
      come back home alive.

863
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,780
         Richard Rubio:
  Hello, Sandy, it's me again.

864
00:56:57,797 --> 00:56:59,698
       I guess it's about
      time I got around to

865
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,284
      sending another tape.

866
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,820
         It's been kind
       of bad around here,

867
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,456
       the atmosphere and
   everything cause we've been

868
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:10,659
           getting hit
       kinda hard lately.

869
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,429
    Watching all these guys,
     these friends of mine,

870
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:18,150
     get killed and wounded,
   they're all so close to me

871
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,202
         and everything,
   they're just like brothers

872
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,704
   and it really hurts a lot.

873
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,740
      But I've been trying
    not to think about it so

874
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,410
   I won't go out of my head.

875
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,048
      <i> [inaudible chatter]</i>

876
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,350
      Larry Lilley: It was
     as much a mental war as

877
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,469
     it was a physical war.

878
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:42,424
      Hours of non-contact,
     and then 10 minutes of

879
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:46,728
       intense fire fight
       and it's over with.

880
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:54,336
    They wounded half a dozen
 of us and pulled out and gone.

881
00:57:56,606 --> 00:58:02,477
     John Sclimenti: People
  don't understand what happens

882
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:06,949
       to someone that is
    in that kind of conflict

883
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,952
       day in and day out.

884
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:16,325
     People's minds have to
  shut out a lot of bad things.

885
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:23,532
     I have lots of stories
    to tell but not a lot of

886
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,168
      them are bad things,
            you know,

887
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,370
       it's just incidents
         that happened.

888
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,939
      I don't know if I do
    that because I don't want

889
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,743
    to remember those things,
   or those other things were

890
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:38,113
       nicer to remember.

891
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,484
       Larry Lilley: John
     was the comedian of the

892
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,453
       whole damn company.

893
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,956
       He was always doing
     something like a stunt,

894
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,593
    which brought our spirits
     up, our camaraderie up.

895
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,795
          I love John.

896
00:58:55,531 --> 00:58:57,432
       John Sclimenti: You
    wanna hear a funny story?

897
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,434
  I'll tell you a funny story.

898
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:03,005
      We had this crotchety
 old sergeant that was with us.

899
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,274
     He always used to say,
 when we'd go out in the field,

900
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:08,076
   "You guys don't camouflage,
      you don't, you know,

901
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,711
           "You're not
        doing a good job"

902
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,880
         and the normal
       sayings, you know,

903
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,849
     "You guys are too close
   together, one hand grenade

904
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,150
        would getcha all"

905
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,686
       and all that stuff.

906
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,722
        Well, we started
    going out to this field,

907
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,592
   and all of a sudden one of
  the guys hits me and he goes,

908
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,194
   "Do you see where we are?"

909
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:31,333
    We were in this humongous
       field of marijuana!

910
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,903
      Guys are grabbing it,
  sticking it in their hats and

911
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,872
      sticking it in their
      shirts and putting it

912
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,106
       in their backpacks,

913
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,342
      and their putting it
     in; they had it hanging

914
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,312
    out of their pockets and
  everything like that and this

915
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:47,482
     old sergeant walks over
    and sees us and he goes,

916
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:53,288
  "That's what I like, you guys
  finally got into camouflage!"

917
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,965
          Larry Lilley:
         When we cut up,

918
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:07,302
     it's our way of getting
      rid of some pressure.

919
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:13,642
       We all decompressed
        as best we could.

920
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:17,279
       Bill Reynolds: And
  sometimes the USO would come

921
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,614
      out to entertain us.

922
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:22,751
          And we would
       laugh and carry on.

923
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,886
       Whether it was good
     music or not, you know,

924
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,222
     we were having a blast.

925
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,791
   You had to love every day.

926
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,461
      Cause you didn't know
   how long you were going to

927
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:36,398
    make it through the year.

928
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:45,507
    My first patrol out after
    that June 19th affair was

929
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,210
    July 11th and, you know,

930
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:52,114
         another search
      and destroy mission.

931
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:58,253
    Jack Benedick: July 11th
 was another standard operation

932
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,655
       and we were in the
    same area that we were in

933
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:04,826
      for the 19th of June.

934
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,815
     Bill Reynolds: My squad
  had just gone on a recon and

935
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:13,068
     got into the tree line
     and Jack Benedick sent

936
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,636
       another squad out,

937
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:18,540
       Smitty's squad out,
       for the next recon.

938
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,575
         Richard Rubio:
        Sergeant Kenney,

939
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,811
           who went to
      Canoga High with me,

940
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,414
         he was my squad
       leader at the time.

941
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,850
     We were walking across
     this dry rice paddy and

942
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:34,489
      he turns to me says,
  "Richard you get behind me."

943
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,958
      So he takes one step
     in front of me and gets

944
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,761
     shot through the heart.

945
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:45,967
     Bill Reynolds: And man,
   all hell broke loose again.

946
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:50,105
       So we're scrambling
   around trying to get cover

947
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,507
          and the call
     came in from Benedick,

948
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:54,910
        you gotta get out
       to Smitty's squad.

949
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:57,679
    You lift your head up to
   see where Smitty's squad is

950
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:02,150
   and you barely look up and
the bullets are flying past you.

951
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,920
    And you get to the point
  where there's nothing to hide

952
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,522
   behind to get out to those
      guys and we were just

953
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,525
      completely stuck and
   of course the enemy wasn't

954
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,127
        going to let up.

955
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,795
        They were glad we
    were stuck and they were

956
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:17,032
      shooting like crazy.

957
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,868
   And Jack made the decision
     at the end of that day

958
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:23,939
      that we need to pull
     back to the tree line.

959
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,041
         Terry McBride:
         Sergeant says,

960
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,876
        "We'll get Kenney
        in the morning."

961
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,045
       And I said, "No, we
  ain't leaving him out there."

962
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:34,015
        I said, "Lets at
     least try to get him."

963
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,817
       And Sergeant said,

964
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,286
    "You guys get your asses
     back in this perimeter.

965
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:43,391
    I don't care what happens
  you guys stay with the unit."

966
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,597
   Jack Benedick: You got guys
  out there, probably are shot,

967
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:53,168
      could be killed, but
  you still had more with you.

968
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:57,372
   You had to safeguard those
    guys as much as possible.

969
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:02,511
      Bill Reynolds: And it
  was a tough pill to swallow,

970
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:07,115
    to leave them there, not
 knowing what happened to them,

971
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:11,286
          but back into
       the trees we went.

972
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,361
       And we sat there in
   those trees all night long,

973
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,864
         looking across
      that open rice paddy,

974
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:26,935
         wondering what
   happened to Smitty's squad.

975
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,738
    And in the middle of the
    night we could see a red

976
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,741
       light moving around
     out there, a map light,

977
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,076
     and we wanted to shoot,
     but we knew we couldn't

978
01:03:35,127 --> 01:03:37,646
           because our
      guys were out there.

979
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:43,084
         And you think,
      wow, what's going on?

980
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:52,527
        The next morning,
        barely daylight,

981
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:55,931
       and here come Frank
    Schwan and Henry Hubbard,

982
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:59,501
         back to us from
         Smitty's squad.

983
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:04,606
     Frank had a bullet hole
    in his chest and Hubbard

984
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,410
  was carrying him back mostly.

985
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,111
       And that's when we
      found out those guys,

986
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,982
    the other guys were dead.

987
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,987
     Terry McBride: I guess
    the VC had taken off and

988
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,122
          we got up and
        moved up to where

989
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,359
   Sergeant Kenney was laying.

990
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:28,263
      I remember walking up
      to him and it's like,

991
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,932
     I'm looking at him and
     the VC had went through

992
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,901
         all his stuff.

993
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:35,370
    They'd taken his helmet,
  and went through his wallet,

994
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,172
   and took his marriage ring.

995
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,710
    They cut a tattoo off of
him that he had on his shoulder.

996
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:45,714
          They cut that
       off of him and, uh,

997
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,383
            <i> [sighs].</i>

998
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,687
   I was blown at that point.

999
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,990
       Bill Reynolds: The
   Viet Cong came across that

1000
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:59,527
      open field with that
 red light, shining on our guys,

1001
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,764
      and taking everything
  they had their wedding rings,

1002
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:06,368
   weapons and their helmets,
  everything of any use at all,

1003
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:12,340
    they took it off of them,
   their boots and everything.

1004
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:17,178
     Terry McBride: Sergeant
   comes up to me and he says,

1005
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,948
    "McBride, a helicopter's
  coming in to pick up Kenney."

1006
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,816
           "They got a
    prisoner over here too."

1007
01:05:21,867 --> 01:05:24,686
  He says, "I want you to take
that prisoner and put him on the

1008
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,221
     helicopter with Kenny."

1009
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,056
        He turned around
        and walked away.

1010
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,924
       They walked over to
      me with the prisoner,

1011
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:33,395
      and I looked at him,
        he looked at me,

1012
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:36,931
     and I pulled my .45 out
  and blew his (bleep) head off

1013
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,533
         right in front
          of everybody.

1014
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,635
       You know, it's just
      like, you know what,

1015
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,537
         you ain't good
     enough to ride with my

1016
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,673
       partner going home.

1017
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,643
   And, uh, you know, I kinda
  feel bad about that in a way,

1018
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:52,847
      but at the same time,
   there's no way he rode back

1019
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:58,553
        on no helicopter
         with my friend.

1020
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:16,888
  Herb Lind: After these times
  when we had our big battles,

1021
01:06:16,956 --> 01:06:19,624
       we would usually go
    to base camp at Dong Tam,

1022
01:06:19,692 --> 01:06:22,027
        which often times
       is described as the

1023
01:06:22,094 --> 01:06:25,430
         Mobile Riverine
        Force Base Camp.

1024
01:06:25,498 --> 01:06:29,434
          We had a PX,
     we had a swimming pool.

1025
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:32,337
      And this was a place
    where the troops would go

1026
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,757
      when they were not on
  operations and on the ships.

1027
01:06:35,841 --> 01:06:38,743
      They had a chance to
    do the things that would

1028
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:42,313
   relieve some of the stress.

1029
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,819
        John Young: While
      we were on Dong Tam,

1030
01:06:47,887 --> 01:06:50,255
         I think all the
   infantry battalions in the

1031
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:52,257
       9th Division at one
       time or another ran

1032
01:06:52,324 --> 01:06:54,325
       med-cap operations.

1033
01:06:54,393 --> 01:06:57,362
        We would secure a
  perimeter around a village or

1034
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,365
    a couple of villages and
  then a medical team from the

1035
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,268
   division would go in there
    and deal with any kind of

1036
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:05,737
        immediate medical
   problems that the civilian

1037
01:07:05,805 --> 01:07:09,407
     population might have.

1038
01:07:09,475 --> 01:07:10,975
          Herb Lind: If
      they had a building,

1039
01:07:11,043 --> 01:07:12,177
          like a school
     that needed something,

1040
01:07:12,244 --> 01:07:14,479
     the troops would pitch
    in and help restore it or

1041
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:18,183
       fix it or paint it
     or whatever they could.

1042
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,352
   And I'm sure that it helped
  the troops and maybe relieved

1043
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,588
    some of their tensions of
   what they were doing in the

1044
01:07:23,656 --> 01:07:27,826
     field and the fact that
 you were killing other people.

1045
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:33,798
       John Bradfield: The
  children were just dirt poor.

1046
01:07:33,866 --> 01:07:37,402
   I remember one of the baby
  sans walking up to me and he

1047
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:42,807
   has a sort of smoking item
 in his hand, some sort of leaf.

1048
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,910
        And he offered me
        something to eat.

1049
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:50,081
   And he opened up this leaf,
   and I thought it might have

1050
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,618
       been a baked potato
     but, no, it was a rat.

1051
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,521
             A rat!

1052
01:07:56,589 --> 01:07:59,057
      Wrapped up in leaves.

1053
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:01,359
       And, I thought that
        was kind of nice,

1054
01:08:01,427 --> 01:08:05,930
  but I had to decline the rat.

1055
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,233
     John Young: Even though
  they can't speak English and

1056
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,235
       we of course can't
        speak Vietnamese,

1057
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:11,803
      you develop a certain
      friendship with them

1058
01:08:11,871 --> 01:08:13,605
         after a while.

1059
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,107
    And there was one little
   girl that took a particular

1060
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,309
        liking to one of
      the guys in my squad,

1061
01:08:18,377 --> 01:08:20,979
   a guy named Benny Bridges.

1062
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:23,114
     If he was on the bunker
   that little girl was always

1063
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:26,918
      some place close by.

1064
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:35,460
        After we finished
     that stint at Dong Tam,

1065
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,296
      we went back actively
         involved in the

1066
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:43,401
      Riverine force again.

1067
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:50,275
        And one morning,
   we had been on an operation

1068
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,244
     southeast of Dong Tam,
    as I recall in an area we

1069
01:08:53,312 --> 01:08:55,613
     had never been before.

1070
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:59,284
    And we knew the operation
   was over and we were going

1071
01:08:59,351 --> 01:09:01,586
       to be picked up by
   aircraft and flown back to

1072
01:09:01,654 --> 01:09:05,690
       the Riverine base.

1073
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:09,027
         John Sclimenti:
   Beautiful day, sun was out,

1074
01:09:09,094 --> 01:09:11,362
        wasn't real hot.

1075
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,365
      A couple of the other
 guys were getting some food or

1076
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:17,902
         drink or rest.

1077
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:21,072
      John Young: And Benny
   got the word over the radio

1078
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,676
 that the aircraft were inbound.

1079
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:28,546
     And he stood up and he
   called out to all of us in

1080
01:09:28,614 --> 01:09:33,451
    the squad, "The choppers
   are on the way, saddle up."

1081
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,554
         John Sclimenti:
    And then all of a sudden,

1082
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:39,257
       we heard a shot and
   I heard somebody yell that

1083
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:42,393
        Bridges was down.

1084
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:50,268
  John Young: Then suddenly all
 I could hear was Benny Bridges

1085
01:09:50,336 --> 01:09:54,973
       choking, strangling
        on his own blood.

1086
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:59,744
    So I just held him there
    so that he didn't choke,

1087
01:09:59,812 --> 01:10:05,083
       because I couldn't
   stand to hear him choking.

1088
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:08,853
       And in a couple of
  minutes the medics came back

1089
01:10:08,921 --> 01:10:13,424
  and they carried Benny away.

1090
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:17,729
     They told me later that
   he died during the medevac

1091
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:23,768
       flight to Dong Tam.

1092
01:10:34,213 --> 01:10:40,351
     Later on, we landed at
  Dong Tam and that little girl

1093
01:10:40,419 --> 01:10:45,556
      from the village came
    looking around for Benny.

1094
01:10:45,624 --> 01:10:52,163
   And I had to convey to her
   some how or other that her

1095
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:56,567
   good friend Benny was dead.

1096
01:10:56,635 --> 01:10:59,103
    And the little girl took
   the news and then she just

1097
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:03,474
     walked off and I don't
   think I ever saw her again.

1098
01:11:08,147 --> 01:11:12,083
     And the times that I've
  visited the Vietnam Memorial

1099
01:11:12,151 --> 01:11:18,423
       in DC, I always go
   to find Benny's name first.

1100
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:26,364
     And it always, his name
    always gets to me because

1101
01:11:26,432 --> 01:11:31,569
   there's just no real reason
  on earth that I'm standing on

1102
01:11:31,637 --> 01:11:34,038
       the ground looking
       up at his name and

1103
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:36,607
    not the other way around.

1104
01:11:36,675 --> 01:11:41,079
          There's just
        no reason at all.

1105
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,595
          Larry Lilley:
     We only had, you know,

1106
01:11:57,663 --> 01:12:00,264
     a couple what I'd call
   pretty good sized battles,

1107
01:12:00,332 --> 01:12:03,301
   but it was those 15 minute
    contacts where they would

1108
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:06,237
       pick off one or two
     guys and next week it's

1109
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:08,072
      one or two more guys,

1110
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:12,076
      and the next week its
 another three guys or six guys.

1111
01:12:12,144 --> 01:12:16,180
     And over a period of a
     year you realize, jeez.

1112
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:20,802
       I don't hardly know

     John Young: As a rifle
    squad leader I don't have

1121
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,918
         a great deal of
    influence over, you know,

1122
01:12:53,986 --> 01:12:56,487
          big decisions

1124
01:12:59,358 --> 01:13:04,028
    I mean I'm the authority
     within my 8 or 10 guys.

1125
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:10,101
  I was very careful about who
  I selected to do some of the

1126
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:15,306
   dirty little dangerous jobs
  that never get any thanks and

1127
01:13:15,374 --> 01:13:19,844
    seem unnecessarily risky.

1128
01:13:19,912 --> 01:13:23,247
   Like when you have to send
  a three man team out to do a,

1129
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:26,484
       recon a tree line.

1130
01:13:26,552 --> 01:13:29,487
  You send three men out there
  because you don't want to get

1131
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:32,990
    the whole unit caught out
  there so you send three men.

1132
01:13:33,058 --> 01:13:37,628
      Well, when it was my
 squad's turn to send three men,

1133
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:41,199
    who was I going to send?

1134
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:45,103
       Am I going to send
 John Sclimenti and Ben Acevedo

1135
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,905
        and the veterans

1136
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:50,741
       year and a half and
 fought and bled along side me?

1137
01:13:50,809 --> 01:13:53,244
          Or am I gonna
       pick out a rookie,

1138
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:56,247
   a guy's whose name I don't
    even know, a replacement?

1139
01:13:56,315 --> 01:13:59,984
        What's the right
       thing to do there?

1140
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:03,187
           What's the
       right thing to do?

1141
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:06,824
          I don't know
       the answer to that,

1142
01:14:06,892 --> 01:14:12,930
    I do know that from that
point forward, whenever I could,

1143
01:14:12,998 --> 01:14:18,402
     I gave the replacements
   the short end of the stick.

1144
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:24,041
     And that's just tough,
    because I wasn't going to

1145
01:14:24,076 --> 01:14:28,946
    risk one of my old timers
 if I didn't absolutely have to.

    Edwin Newman: The war in
 Vietnam has become the central

1147
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:38,756
          issue here in
       the United States.

1148
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:42,160
      This week hundreds of
 people demonstrated against it,

1149
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:45,229
        tens of thousands
     marched to support it.

1150
01:14:45,297 --> 01:14:47,865
        It's a political
      issue, a moral issue,

1151
01:14:47,933 --> 01:14:51,135
     but most of all it has
    become a personal issue.

1152
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:54,438
      Each person must come
    to grips with it himself,

1153
01:14:54,506 --> 01:14:57,542
         for it affects
         each one of us.

1154
01:14:57,609 --> 01:15:00,178
      John Young: We're all
     accustomed to choosing

1155
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,313
        between right and
    wrong and good and evil,

1156
01:15:02,381 --> 01:15:04,882
      that's an easy thing
        for people to do.

1157
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:07,185
    War is a terrible thing.

1158
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:10,454
   And it's terrible not only
   because people get killed,

1159
01:15:10,522 --> 01:15:13,658
    it's terrible because you
    have to make some kind of

1160
01:15:13,725 --> 01:15:16,661
       decision and there
    aren't any good options.

1161
01:15:16,728 --> 01:15:19,697
      You can do something
     that's cruel and ugly,

1162
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:24,569
   or something that's crueler
      yet and uglier still.

1163
01:15:24,636 --> 01:15:28,873
         There's no good
         option to take.

1164
01:15:29,975 --> 01:15:38,149
    And I'd really rather not
  have anybody who hasn't been

1165
01:15:38,217 --> 01:15:43,087
     through something like
    that pass judgment on me.

1166
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:51,062
   Don't be too sure about the
  decision you would have made.

1167
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:54,065
        And don't be smug
    about your morality until

1168
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:55,583
       you had it tested.

1169
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,201
         Bill Reynolds:
     You're scared at first.

1170
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:18,172
        And, uh, after, I
   don't know, 3 or 4 months,

1171
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,774
     you stop being scared.

1172
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:24,345
       You figure, you're
       not gonna make it.

1173
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:28,516
    And it was that way for a
  good deal of my tour of duty.

1174
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:31,919
      Just figured to hell
   with it, I'm doing my job,

1175
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,921
        I'm probably not
        going to make it.

1176
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:37,324
       And I ceased being
     scared, really scared.

1177
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,529
         And, uh, about
       three months to go,

1178
01:16:41,596 --> 01:16:45,866
        I started getting
   scared again thinking that

1179
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:49,837
        I might make it.

01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:17,982
       and decided quickly
     and get in or get out.

1189
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:24,438
   That's not the kind of war
   we are fighting in Vietnam.

1190
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:29,076
     We don't march out and
   have a big battle each day

1191
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,579
       in a guerrilla war.

1192
01:17:31,646 --> 01:17:33,848
       It's a new kind of
    war for us so it doesn't

1193
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:37,018
         move that fast.

1194
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:40,988
     We are making progress,
     we are pleased with the

1195
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:44,392
          results that
         we are getting.

1196
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:50,498
      Herb Lind: At times,
we questioned what are we doing,

1197
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:54,935
       why are we here and
     we didn't have answers.

1198
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:58,039
    We thought we were there
   to do good and we believed

1199
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:00,708
      for the most part in
   the fact that we were there

1200
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:04,445
         for a purpose.

1201
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:18,659
   Larry Lilley: My impression
   when we went to Vietnam was

1202
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:24,498
    that the communists were
 trying to force their influence

1203
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:28,736
     on the South and we had
 seen what it had done in Europe

1204
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:33,474
          and we wanted
          to stop that.

1205
01:18:36,027 --> 01:18:38,946
     Steve Hopper: I didn't
  care what the nation thought

1206
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,615
     or what some protester
    might have thought about

1207
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,417
       what we were doing.

1208
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:48,022
     I cared more about the
  purpose that I had been given

1209
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:53,561
  at that point in my life and
  that was to serve my country.

1210
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,770
         Bill Reynolds:
     I really believe that,

1211
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:05,573
           despite how
        the war ended up,

1212
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:08,058
      that the time that we
     were in Vietnam we did

1213
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:12,379
      a lot of good for the
    South Vietnamese people.

1214
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:17,952
      That the strategy for
   the Mekong Delta was sound.

1215
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:23,724
         Gosh, I'd like
     to believe that it was.

   Terry McBride: Seeing that
     freedom plane come by,

1222
01:19:51,786 --> 01:19:53,854
       and knowing that we
       were getting on it,

1223
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:56,290
        and that we were
        gonna be leaving,

1224
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:59,260
      that was probably one
   of the better feelings that

1225
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:03,797
      I've had in my life.

1226
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,667
       Bill Reynolds: Man,
     it was a regular Pan Am

1227
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:11,038
      with stewardesses and
     it was just jubilation.

1228
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:12,773
     Jubilation throughout.

1229
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:16,460
          Everybody was
    screaming and hollering.

1230
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,147
      Terry McBride: I can
   remember the pilot saying,

1231
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:23,384
     "Well guys, we'll be up
   to about 200 miles an hour

1232
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:25,052
   here in about ten seconds,"

1233
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,788
            he says,
     "So you got 10 seconds

1234
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,057
     to die in this country
      and I think we're all

1235
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,391
         gonna make it."

1236
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:33,527
    And boy, he just powered
 that and hit the thrusters and

1237
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:35,796
      shove you back in the
    seat of that airplane and

1238
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:40,067
    we were on our way home.

1239
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:42,570
    Steve Hopper: We were all
   up yelling and hugging each

1240
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:44,972
    other and celebrating the
  fact that we made it through

1241
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,209
    our 12 months in Vietnam.

1242
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:51,145
          Larry Lilley:
      When we touched down,

1243
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:54,248
      I'd say 50% of us got
   to the bottom of the stairs

1244
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,417
     and kissed the ground.

1245
01:20:56,484 --> 01:21:00,387
       And then continued
       on in the terminal.

1246
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:07,695
      Steve Hopper: And we
  walked down to the exit area

1247
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,964
         at the airport.

1248
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:13,450
         And there were
     some protesters there,

1249
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:19,607
         spitting at us,
      saying things to us.

1250
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,245
          Larry Lilley:
        Calling us names,

1251
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:28,115
       throwing garbage at
     us and spitting at us.

1252
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,518
      Willie McTear: I was
    so disappointed and hurt,

1253
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:35,756
    I went into the bathroom,
     took my uniform off and

1254
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:42,096
   stuffed it in my duffle bag
   and put on some civilians.

1255
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:46,567
        I didn't wanna be
   part of the Army any more.

1256
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:49,403
    Steve Hopper: You were so
   anxious to step out of this

1257
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,772
   situation you had been in.

1258
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,975
    You said goodbye to them.

1259
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:57,611
    Bill Reynolds: We didn't
    even stop and think that

1260
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,447
           this is it.

1261
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:05,486
       We've been together
     for 18 months I guess.

1262
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:10,090
   You're so young and all you
  can think about is get home,

1263
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:14,194
      and just pick up the
    life that you had before.

1264
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:16,530
  Steve Hopper: And you walked
    out and you got in a taxi

1265
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:21,735
     and all of a sudden you
    were all separated again.

1266
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:41,722
           John Young:
      When I left Vietnam,

1267
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,891
      my parents had known
  within a couple of days when

1268
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:46,427
         I was due home,
  but I hadn't been able to be

1269
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:49,697
    any more exact than that.

1270
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:52,783
         Once I landed,
   I didn't call them either,

1271
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:55,369
        I just continued
      on home to Minnesota.

1272
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,671
   When I got to Minneapolis,
   I got off the aircraft and

1273
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:00,641
          I took a taxi
      to my parents' house.

1274
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:04,311
     So, the first thing my
  parents knew was that a taxi

1275
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:09,416
    pulled into the driveway
  and then suddenly I was home.

1276
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:16,290
        James Nall: I got
     to mom and dad's house,

1277
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:18,125
      they just celebrated.

1278
01:23:18,176 --> 01:23:21,662
   They had the whole family,
      everybody come over.

1279
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:26,600
    It was like the prodigal
    son come home, you know.

1280
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:35,576
        Gary Maibach: Dad
       and mom came up and

1281
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:41,915
             yeah I,

1282
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:46,286
     I don't have the words.

1283
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:56,096
    Steve Hopper: I came home
     and, I remember flying,

1284
01:23:56,164 --> 01:24:04,405
     landing at the airport,
   I walked into the terminal

1285
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:08,459
   and I heard a girl scream.

1286
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:14,848
   And it was Jen, my fiancé.

1287
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,714
         Bill Reynolds:
    After I returned back to

1288
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:50,684
           "The World"
        as we called it,

1289
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:53,887
     you know I went back to
  work and whenever I talked to

1290
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:58,192
     anybody about Vietnam,
    it was heavy on my mind,

1291
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:02,429
         no one was real
       interested in that.

1292
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,431
         You could tell,
       the body language,

1293
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,867
    that you're talking about
   stuff that they don't wanna

1294
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,702
       hear about and you
     stop talking about it.

1295
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,438
      And years roll by and
   you're busy moving forward

1296
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:13,106
          in your life;
        getting married,

1297
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:14,641
          having kids,
        responsibilities,

1298
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:17,144
   home mortgage and so forth,

1299
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:22,816
     and, so , you know, you
  lose contact with those guys.

1300
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:25,752
      Steve Hopper: Because
   of the protests and because

1301
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:30,791
     of the way the country
   felt about the Vietnam War,

1302
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:35,762
         many of us just
     kinda tucked it aside.

1303
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:41,201
    All of those experiences
   we had had and what we had

1304
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:46,673
     witnessed and seen and
      even the friendships.

1305
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:54,648
      We kind of hid all of
  those inside of us for many,

1306
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:58,185
        many, many years.

1307
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:01,355
     Gary Maibach: I didn't
       hear from the guys,

1308
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:04,324
         but maybe once
        or twice a year.

1309
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:08,529
         And then it got
       to the point where,

1310
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:13,166
     "Doc, what do you think
   of a reunion of some sort?"

1311
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:21,575
   It's just incredible for me
   to look out over this group

1312
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:26,280
      and I appreciate all
  who made the effort to come.

1313
01:26:26,847 --> 01:26:30,150
    Steve Hopper: We finally
   get together 23 years later

1314
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:33,270
      and start reminiscing
   and sharing stories for the

1315
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:37,291
         first time and
     it was pretty amazing.

1316
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,126
         Pretty amazing.

1317
01:26:39,193 --> 01:26:41,094
      Alright, John Young.

01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:45,365
     John Young: Oh, hello,
     meet my daughter Peggy.

1319
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:49,970
    We had our first reunion
   in 1989 and since that time

1320
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,772
         we've had, oh,

1321
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:53,640
    I think a dozen or more.

1322
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,293
       And we'll continue
        to have reunions.

1323
01:26:56,411 --> 01:27:00,380
       Jack Benedick: It's
   good to see the guys after

1324
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:02,549
      all we went through.

1325
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:06,086
    That makes me feel proud.

1326
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:13,293
      John Young: Brothers
   is exactly the right term.

1327
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:17,664
   Those guys are everything,
     just everything to me.

1328
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:20,200
     It's as plain as that.

1329
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:28,200
战   火   兄   弟   连

1330
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:36,200
