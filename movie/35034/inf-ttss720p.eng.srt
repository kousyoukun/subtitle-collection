1
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,065
You weren't followed?

2
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,449
No.

3
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,402
Better come in.

4
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,618
Trust no one, Jim.

5
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,790
Especially not in the mainstream.

6
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,759
Sit down.

7
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:50,316
I understand you still have
one Hungarian identity running?

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,814
I do.

9
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,362
I want you to go to Budapest.

10
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,419
'This is not above board.

11
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,583
'Nobody else knows.

12
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,664
'They're after my head, Jim boy.

13
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,087
'Do you understand?

14
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,822
'I have had an offer of service.

15
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,456
'A Hungarian general
wants to come over.

16
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,960
'I would like you to meet him.'

17
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,336
He has some information
that I need, Jim.

18
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,507
What information?

19
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,971
Treasure.

20
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,686
'He has the name of the mole

21
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:16,482
'the Russians have planted
in the British intelligence service

22
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,530
'right at the top of the Circus.

23
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,287
'There's a rotten apple, Jim.

24
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,492
'We have to find it.'

25
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,780
Stop!

26
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,645
Would you witness this for me?

27
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,479
I wish I could done more, Control.

28
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,148
You did all you could, Percy.

29
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,987
Well, a man should know
when to leave the party.

30
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,331
What about Smiley?

31
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,667
Smiley is leaving with me.

32
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,229
You little prick, Esterhase.

33
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,162
Gentlemen, shall we start?

34
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,063
Under Secretary Lacon
is ready for you, Sir Percy.

35
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,606
The Treasury don't understand.

36
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,942
Why can't the intelligence service
simply put in a request

37
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,653
for a general increase in funding

38
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,703
and then you account
for the spend on your special operation?

39
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,583
Operation Witchcraft
needs to remain secret.

40
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,663
- It's a fiefdom of its own.
- Yes, that's what's worrying us.

41
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,417
The whole thing's
very unaccountable, isn't it?

42
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,756
And this London house
that nobody knows the address of,

43
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,511
is that really necessary?

44
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,007
Now more than ever.
We need to protect our Soviet source.

45
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,843
So where do you propose we meet?
In a cafÃ©?

46
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,684
The rent and rates on this house
have doubled.

47
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,943
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

48
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,940
We're asking
for a few thousand for a house.

49
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,030
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

50
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,901
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

51
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,529
Look, nobody underestimates

52
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,283
the importance of the job
you chaps are doing.

53
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,703
But what happened
in Budapest last year,

54
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,579
that was a disaster.

55
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,621
With respect, sir,

56
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,792
it wasn't one of your civil servants
that got killed, was it?

57
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,333
Now this isn't about soldiers
in trenches any more.

58
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,759
- We're the front line now...
- Roy!

59
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,258
For 25 years we've been the only thing
standing between them and Karla

60
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,634
and Moscow
and the third bloody world war.

61
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,940
Look, the Minister's very pleased
with your progress so far.

62
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,771
He's less pleased, though,

63
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,477
with the lack of progress
with our American cousins.

64
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,569
You see,

65
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,778
in their eyes,

66
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,320
you're still a leaky ship.

67
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,548
Yes?

68
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,720
'Someone on the line for you, sir.
Seems urgent.'

69
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,597
All right, well put him through.

70
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,809
- Hello?
- 'Is this Under Secretary Lacon?'

71
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,273
Yes.

72
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,610
My name's Ricki Tarr.

73
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,114
- 'What do you want?'
- I need to meet you.

74
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,743
If you need to confirm who I am,
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

75
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,616
Peter Guillam.

76
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,371
But only Guillam, no one else.

77
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,517
You got clearance for that?

78
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,514
Well, I'm not bloody
chaining it up outside.

79
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,268
Mind you, no better off in here
with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

80
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,973
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

81
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,645
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse
of the new girl before Bland gets to her.

82
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,114
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

83
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,282
- Has he seen her yet?
- Of course he has.

84
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,119
Came down first thing this morning.

85
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,954
Belinda.

86
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,003
- Peter Guillam.
- 'Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

87
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,710
'Just ringing to find out...

88
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,299
'So Winston
Churchill saved your life, Edie.'

89
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,104
'I was working in the kitchen,
getting dinner ready.

90
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,937
'And he was late, you see.'

91
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,436
- 'During a raid?'
- 'During a raid, you see.'

92
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,393
'He said,
"Why aren't you in that shelter?"'

93
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,069
- 'Why weren't you?'
- 'Well, because...'

94
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,663
I was sorry to hear
about Control, Mr. Smiley.

95
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,930
'He said Tarr called him
from a phone box.'

96
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,770
He said there's a mole,

97
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,229
right at the top of the Circus,

98
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,982
that he's been there for years.

99
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,341
It does mean

100
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,392
you're rather well placed
to look into this matter for us now,

101
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,595
doesn't it?

102
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,391
Outside the family.

103
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,984
I'm retired, Oliver.

104
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,278
You fired me.

105
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,287
The thing is,

106
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,372
some time ago before Control died,

107
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,039
he came to me
with a similar suggestion.

108
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,456
That there is a mole.

109
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,710
He never mentioned
his suspicions to you?

110
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,171
No.

111
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,890
Oh, I just thought that
as you were his man, so to speak...

112
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,391
What did you say to him?

113
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,273
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia
had rather gotten the better of him

114
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
and he was going to pull
his whole house down.

115
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,604
That bloody mess in Budapest.

116
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,027
Damn it, George.

117
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,201
It's your generation, your legacy.

118
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,994
I would have thought, if there's
any truth in it, you'd want to...

119
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,073
I'll keep Peter.

120
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,828
And there's a retired
Special Branch man, Mendel.

121
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,075
I should like to have him.

122
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,538
Lift up.

123
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,503
And quickly down again.

124
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,015
There's a place I know, sir.
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

125
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:24,179
Be careful with it. Please.
It's Georgian.

126
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:28,091
My friend wants peace and quiet
in order to work, Mrs. Pope Graham.

127
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,342
No disturbances.

128
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,803
Her real name is just Graham.

129
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,064
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

130
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,876
'Peter, did you get the keys
to Control's flat?'

131
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:05,595
â™?And did those feet in ancient time

132
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:10,017
â™?Walk upon England's
mountains green ?

133
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,804
Oh!

134
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,101
'George!'

135
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,615
George, get in here!

136
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,863
George.

137
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,616
Sit down.

138
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,081
Take a look at this nonsense.

139
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,633
Report by Soviet high command

140
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:14,633
on their recent naval exercises
in the Black Sea.

141
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,391
Just what the admiralty
has been begging us

142
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,230
for some information on.

143
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,601
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't.

144
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,645
Percy and his little cabal
walked in with it.

145
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,855
- Look, Control...
- Shut up.

146
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,988
Style appalling.

147
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,119
Patently a fabrication
from beginning to end.

148
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:37,374
- Just could be the real thing.
- Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

149
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,211
But its topicality makes it suspect.

150
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:44,623
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

151
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,593
Where did it come from?
What's the access?

152
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,758
A new secret source of mine.

153
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,548
But how could he
possibly have access?

154
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,848
He has access to the most sensitive
levels of policy-making.

155
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,352
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

156
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,397
Oh, Percy and his pals
bypassed us, Smiley.

157
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,731
Gone straight to the minister.

158
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,107
Percy has been allowed to keep
the identity of his new friend

159
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,698
top secret.

160
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:13,407
The minister agrees too many secrets
are blown around here.

161
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,446
Too much failure,
too many scandals.

162
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,914
- Too little solid intelligence.
- Percy does have a point, Control.

163
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,711
We should be fighting Communism,
not each other.

164
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,541
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation,
our partners.

165
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:25,953
Your bloody Yanks!

166
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,498
We've had enough!
There's going to be changes.

167
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:32,419
We need to decide if want to be
part of the past or part of the future.

168
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,675
I should have left you
where I found you.

169
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,848
- Look!
- Control...

170
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,721
Out, all of you!

171
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,836
If Witchcraft is genuine...

172
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,253
Nothing is genuine any more.

173
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,603
George...

174
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,651
Do you want me to get
this stuff over to the hotel?

175
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,011
Thank you. Er, anywhere will do.

176
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,350
- Peter?
- Hm?

177
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,849
I need you to do something for me.

178
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,446
I'd like you to go to the Circus.

179
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,161
'In the cabinet
at the duty officers' station

180
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,530
'are records of staff recently retired.

181
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,661
'I'd like photographs of them

182
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:32,173
'and of the diagram of the Circus's
reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

183
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:37,007
'along with a list of all payments
made from the Reptile fund.'

184
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:13,420
- Help you with anything, Bill?
- I was just looking for his Majesty.

185
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,708
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

186
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,966
Oh.

187
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:59,178
- Heard you had an accident, Peter.
- Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

188
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:02,009
When are you going
to get some new furniture up here?

189
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:08,386
I'll have a word with Esterhase.
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.

190
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,938
- Where are you off to?
- Lunch.

191
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,146
Want some company?

192
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,236
According to the personnel files,

193
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:20,990
seven were due for retirement anyway.

194
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,324
Another four don't seem
particularly mysterious.

195
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,454
Jerry Westerby was dismissed
December 4.

196
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,498
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

197
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,793
That's just two weeks
after you and Control were forced out.

198
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,224
- Return to Oxford, please.
- That's 1. 1 5.

199
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:06,786
Percy has always resisted
any proposal

200
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:10,697
of a wider exploitation
of Witchcraft's intelligence.

201
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,707
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

202
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,671
I've refused to share Witchcraft
with our allies so far, Minister.

203
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,881
Greedy boy.

204
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:22,460
My goal has been to establish
its track record beyond all doubt.

205
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:30,390
I think the time has come to approach
our American brothers-in-arms.

206
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:36,984
- Will they take us back into bed?
- I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

207
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,606
I want on-going access
to American intelligence.

208
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,317
You think we can get it?

209
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,234
With Witchcraft on our side, we can
get anything we bloody well want.

210
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,000
Fine.

211
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,075
Carry on.

212
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,840
Thank you.

213
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,890
And I strike thee down...

214
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:40,704
Oh, I, er...

215
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:47,756
Not supposed to.
Doctor's orders.

216
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,426
Wicked, wicked George.

217
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,414
I don't know about you, George,

218
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,081
but I feel seriously under-fucked.

219
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,089
I heard Ann left you again.

220
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,922
She doesn't deserve you, George,
not one hair on your head.

221
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:35,351
You left the Circus
shortly after I retired.

222
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:39,973
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

223
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:43,940
Chucked out on the rubbish heap,
like you.

224
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,101
Why?

225
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:51,698
'Polyakov.

226
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,703
'Do you remember him?'

227
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,033
'From the Soviet Embassy?'

228
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:02,117
'Alexsey Polyakov,
cultural attachÃ© here in London.

229
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,551
'When he arrived here 1 5 years ago,
I requested he be checked out.

230
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,385
'He was graded whiter than white.
Didn't put a foot wrong.'

231
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,592
'But you disagreed?'

232
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,518
'There's a story
you must have heard

233
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,599
'that Karla has set up a secret cell.

234
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,689
'The personnel are all ex-military,

235
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:26,897
'trained to handle
deep-penetration agents, moles.'

236
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,817
'There are always stories,
Connie.'

237
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,487
'But what if this story was true?

238
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:38,238
'One night in research
I saw something, George.

239
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,874
'There was our friend Polyakov
at a May day parade in Berlin

240
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,577
'receiving a salute.'

241
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,501
'Why would you salute
a cultural attachÃ©?'

242
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:51,334
'Exactly.
Unless he was a war veteran himself.'

243
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:55,220
And if he was, why hide the fact?

244
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,974
What did you do?

245
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:59,723
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

246
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:03,055
Here.

247
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:06,560
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood
if ever I saw one.

248
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,817
If he's here, it must be
because he's running a mole.

249
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:11,023
You're to leave Polyakov alone.

250
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:13,280
You're becoming obsessed with him.

251
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:19,455
- You're losing your sense of proportion.
- But that's ridiculous.

252
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:22,702
Perhaps it's time
you went out into the real world.

253
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:39,221
What does it matter?
Old Circus is gone anyway.

254
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,033
Here we are.

255
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,239
The Nursery in our day.

256
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,332
Jim Prideaux.

257
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,043
And Bill Haydon.
Together, of course.

258
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,542
The Inseparables.

259
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,843
There's Control himself.

260
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,633
All my boys.

261
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,724
All my lovely boys.

262
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,765
That was a good time, George.

263
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:31,400
It was the war, Connie.

264
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:36,607
A real war.

265
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,901
Englishmen could be proud then.

266
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,958
So I was right, then?

267
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,414
About Polyakov.

268
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:53,376
There is a mole.

269
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:02,472
If it's bad, don't come back.
I want to remember you all as you were.

270
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:12,022
Percy?
Percy, did you mix this?

271
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,028
Aye, I did so.

272
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:18,821
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

273
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:22,118
Can you nae learn
to take a bloody order?

274
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:25,367
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

275
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,291
- I followed the recipe.
- Come on.

276
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,585
It'll take us five hours
to get drunk on this monkey's piss.

277
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,715
â™?He's not the first

278
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,716
- â™?He's not the first
- Oh, well.

279
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:43,850
- â™?He's the second best secret agent
- Merry Christmas.

280
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,886
â™?In the whole wide world

281
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,558
â™?He's not number one

282
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,181
â™?But not the worst

283
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:54,069
â™?He's just the second best
secret agent

284
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,900
â™?In the whole wide world

285
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:58,692
â™?He's every bit

286
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,031
â™?As good as what's-his-name

287
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:05,069
â™?With a dame

288
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:07,495
â™?Any dame

289
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:11,955
â™?And all those bullet holes
are in his vest

290
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:16,084
â™?To prove you work a little harder

291
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,459
â™?When you're second best... â™?

292
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,153
- Courtesy of Mrs. P.
- Hm?

292
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,200
You been up all night?

293
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:16,003
Yes.

294
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:25,054
What's this?

295
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,007
Request for Â£1,000 in cash
from the Reptile fund.

296
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:32,385
To a Mr. Ellis.

297
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,058
It was one of Jim Prideaux's
work names.

298
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:39,061
Prideaux was killed
in Hungary a year ago.

299
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:40,688
October 21.

300
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:45,652
So why was someone giving him
Â£1,000 two months later?

301
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:50,654
I wonder where he is then, sir.

302
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,812
Settle down now.

303
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:32,153
- Hand those out.
- Sir.

304
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:34,162
What is it?
The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?

305
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,958
The bells, the bells!

306
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:07,904
Ohh!

307
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,292
Come here.

308
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:31,171
- What's your name?
- Roach. Bill Roach, sir.

309
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,927
- I'm a new boy.
- New arrival, eh?

310
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:37,178
- What's the story?
- My mother and father.

311
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:41,267
My father left, so...

312
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,728
Hm.

313
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,318
Bill.

314
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,154
The unpaid Bill.

315
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,694
- Anyone ever call you that?
- No, sir.

316
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:54,903
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

317
00:40:56,998 --> 00:40:59,121
They've all been good 'uns.

318
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,204
What are you good at?

319
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,880
Nothing, sir.

You're a good watcher, though, eh?

321

322
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:18,929
Best watcher in the unit,
Bill Roach is, I'll bet.

323
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:23,729
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right?
- Yes, sir.

324

This is good, very good.

325

Hello, Ricki.

326
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,365
You've missed the wedge.

327
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:12,880
Where have you been, Ricki?

328
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:17,629
They're going to kill me.

329
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:22,263
- Who is?
- Your lot.

330
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:24,719
Or their lot.
Whoever gets me first.

331
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:29,938
I'm innocent.

332
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,562
Within reason.

333
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:35,320
How long have you been here?

334
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:38,366
Sorry, I've run out of places now.

335
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:40,402
I needed to see you.

336

Why?

337
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,665
There's a woman.

338
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:51,662
I need you to trade for her.
I need you to get her back off Karla.

339
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:56,592
A woman?

340

I didn't sleep well.

00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,191
You're going to do something
for me, Peter.

486
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:37,656
I need the duty officer's log book
for last November.

487
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:43,616
I'm going to have to send you
up a floor into the lions' den.

488
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:49,457
If you're caught,

489
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:53,915
you can't mention me.

490
00:59:54,052 --> 00:59:56,721
I'm sorry, but you're alone.

491
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:00,723
- Last November?
- Hm.

492
01:00:11,194 --> 01:00:12,653
Mr. Guillam!

493
01:00:15,323 --> 01:00:16,782
Thank you, Bryant.

494
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:18,153
How's the family?

495
01:00:18,284 --> 01:00:20,657
Fine. Need to go
up to the registry today.

496
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,365
OK, sir.

497
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:26,374
Now you'll need
a yellow one for the bag, sir.

498
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,248
Thank you.

499
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:56,401
- Good morning, Mr. Guillam.
- Morning, Alwyn.

500
01:00:56,531 --> 01:00:58,987
- Want me to look after that for you?
- Thank you.

501
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:06,831
I'll need your chit, Mr. Guillam.

502
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:08,785
Dolphin will kill me if I don't.
New rules.

503
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:12,462
So, chit me.

504
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:19,887
Thanks.

505
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,973
- Sal, lovely surprise.
- Peter.

506
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:33,765
- What are you up to this weekend?
- Oh, you know.

507
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:37,571
Visiting aunts.

508
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:39,606
I'll bet.

509
01:01:47,665 --> 01:01:49,124
Corridor D.

510
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,457
The two eights are halfway
on your right.

511
01:01:51,586 --> 01:01:53,413
The three ones are next alcove down.

512
01:01:53,546 --> 01:01:55,420
Thanks.

'Here's a request
from Libby Barr from Bromley

514
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:47,095
'for "Mr. Wu's A Window Cleaner Now".
Take it away, George.'

515
01:03:03,074 --> 01:03:04,616
Hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.

'Can I speak
to Mr. Guillam, please?'

I'm his car mechanic.

518
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,998
Well, I'll just see if he's available.
Hold on, please.

519
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:21,252
â™?Mr. Wu, what shall I do?

520
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:32,264
- Oh, Christ!
- Telephone, sir.

521
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:35,230
- Who is it?
- Outside line, sir. Someone rough.

522
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:46,902
Sir?

523
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:51,364
- Hello?
- 'Your gearbox is bust, sir.'

524
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:53,786
Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?

525
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,079
'Can't be done, sir.

'Afraid you're going
to need a new gearbox.

527
01:03:57,504 --> 01:04:01,204
Well, phone the main dealership first.
Have you got their number?

528
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:02,455
'No.'

529
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:04,585
Hang on. Alwyn!

530
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:08,173
- Alwyn.
- Sir?

531
01:04:08,306 --> 01:04:09,765
Get me my bag, will you?

532
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:11,634
- But...
- Just for a second.

533
01:04:19,192 --> 01:04:21,149
Thank you.

534
01:04:21,277 --> 01:04:22,736
Hang on.

535
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:40,245
- Hello?
- 'I'm listening.'

536
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,665
- Yes. 9-4-6 0-3-3-5.
- 'Be right on it, sir.'

537
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,342
Thank you.

538
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:51,431
Peter Guillam.

539
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:54,049
Could we see you, please?

540
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:56,178
Percy would like
quite an urgent word with you.

541
01:04:56,312 --> 01:04:59,230
If you can come now to the fifth floor
that would be so kind.

542
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:00,768
Yes, of course.

543
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:04,814
Throw that into the lift for me.

544
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,484
Send it to the second floor,
save me filling out bloody chits.

545
01:05:07,615 --> 01:05:09,240
Will do, sir.

546
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:31,180
So what have you been getting up to
down there these days?

547
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:33,595
Apart from chasing our virgins.

548
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:38,054
A couple of Arab ploys
that look quite promising.

549
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:42,473
Apart from that,
I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

550
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,436
Arabs.

551
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:47,190
You can rent one but you can't buy one.
Right, Bill?

552
01:05:50,825 --> 01:05:53,530
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

553
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:56,579
Fine. We have tea
at Fortnum's every afternoon.

554
01:05:58,249 --> 01:06:01,167
I require the matter
of your discussion with Tarr.

555
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:03,453
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

556
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:13,220
What's that shrug for?

557
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:18,093
I'm talking to you about the traitor

558
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:21,727
who cut the throat
of our man in Istanbul.

559
01:06:21,856 --> 01:06:25,142
I'm talking to you about a defector
from your own damn section.

560
01:06:25,276 --> 01:06:29,191
I'm accusing you of consorting
with an enemy agent behind my back.

561
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:31,694
Don't damn well shrug at me!

562
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:34,777
How would you like a term in prison?

563
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,590
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

564
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:52,840
So get your facts straight
and get off my back!

565
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:56,803
So... if I told you
Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

566
01:06:56,933 --> 01:06:58,760
would you be surprised?

567
01:06:58,893 --> 01:07:01,016
No, nothing would surprise me
about Ricki Tarr.

568
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:05,894
And if I told you we happen to know
Â£30,000 mysteriously appeared

569
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:08,314
in his bank account last month,

570
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,770
would that surprise you?

571
01:07:16,327 --> 01:07:18,997
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

572
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:22,538
Turned by the opposition months ago
and now they've sent him back to us.

573
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:25,454
- What for?
- Never mind what for.

574
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:28,078
To muddy the water,
that's what for.

575
01:07:28,214 --> 01:07:32,164
To spread a whole lot of damn
nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

576
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:33,713
The point is this.

577
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:35,387
He's heading for home.

578
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:38,679
The first peep from him,
you come to the grown-ups.

579
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:40,516
Understood?

580
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:44,143
Anyone you see around this table
but not another damn soul.

581
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,602
Get out.

582
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,445
Peter?

583
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:04,659
Thank you, Belinda.

584
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,048
â™?Oh, Mr. Wu

585
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:13,918
â™?What shall I do?

586
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:21,222
â™?Oh, Mr. Wu

587
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:23,094
â™?What shall I do?

588
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:24,805
â™?Mr. Wu... â™?

591
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,877
All go smoothly, did it?

589
01:08:35,573 --> 01:08:37,365
I need to go to the hotel
to see George.

590
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:40,493
Mr. Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir.
Change of venue.

591
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:53,876
George?

592
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:04,265
Mr. Guillam...

593
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:07,429
Sorry it took me so long
to come home.

594
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:21,485
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

595
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:24,704
He's been telling us
all about his adventures.

596
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:27,743
He's a double, George.

597
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:30,830
There is no mole. Whole thing's
been thought up by Moscow.

598
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:33,169
Karla bought him for Â£30,000.

599
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:36,168
I stole that because of you.

600
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:39,919
I spied on my own because of him.
Do you know how that makes me feel?

601
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:41,300
Ricki...

602
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:45,014
you said you sent the Circus a telegram
concerning Irina's information.

603
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:47,100
- That's right.
- What was the date?

604
01:09:47,228 --> 01:09:49,186
He doesn't know
because there was no telegram.

605
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:52,849
- The whole thing is a fabrication.
- 20th November.

606
01:09:52,984 --> 01:09:56,021
It must have been 20th November.
Evening.

607
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:58,727
'Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre

608
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:01,356
'everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

609
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:05,241
- 'She told me Karla...'
- November 20th is missing.

610
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:09,369
Someone is covering their tracks,
unless of course you think

611
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:11,410
that's just a coincidence?

612
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:17,084
What about the money?

613
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:21,131
30,000 isn't so much for Karla
to pay if it protects his mole.

614
01:10:22,722 --> 01:10:26,506
I'm afraid someone in the Circus
knows all about Mr. Tarr

615
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:30,605
and is doing everything they can
to discredit him.

616
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:34,182
'...everything the Circus thinks
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.'

617
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:42,783
Why didn't you tell me
that you had Tarr?

618
01:10:47,455 --> 01:10:49,614
In case I never made it
out of the Circus.

619
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:52,999
I should get some rest.

620
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:56,834
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

621
01:10:58,299 --> 01:10:59,877
Come up.

622
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,854
I met him once.

623
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:16,817
Karla.

624
01:11:18,486 --> 01:11:19,862
In '55.

625
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:25,321
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

626
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:30,532
Purge after purge.

627
01:11:30,665 --> 01:11:33,037
Half their agents were jumping ship.

628
01:11:34,502 --> 01:11:36,709
I travelled around, signing them up.

629
01:11:38,256 --> 01:11:39,715
Hundreds of them.

630
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:46,221
One of them
was calling himself Gerstmann.

631
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,382
He was on his way back to Russia

632
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:52,969
and we were pretty sure
he was going to be executed.

633
01:11:53,104 --> 01:11:57,600
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi
and that's how long I had

634
01:11:57,734 --> 01:12:00,854
to convince him to come over to us

635
01:12:00,987 --> 01:12:03,063
instead of going home to die.

636
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,495
There's a little room.

637
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,617
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

638
01:12:21,257 --> 01:12:24,709
The Americans had had him tortured.

639
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:30,883
He had no fingernails.

640
01:12:34,604 --> 01:12:36,727
It's incredibly hot.

641
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:45,523
I'm very tired and all I want to do
is get this over with and get back home.

642
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,859
Things weren't going well with Ann.

643
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,499
I give him the usual pitch.

644
01:12:56,626 --> 01:13:00,671
"Come to the West
and we can give you a comfortable life,

645
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:03,755
"after questioning."

646
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:09,554
What did he say?

647
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:16,513
"Think of your wife.

648
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:21,355
"You have a wife, don't you?

649
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:27,780
"Here. I brought you some cigarettes,
by the way.

650
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,578
"Use my lighter.

651
01:13:38,835 --> 01:13:43,995
"We could arrange for her to join you.
We have a lot of stock to trade.

652
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:49,211
"If you go back, she'll be ostracised.
Think of her.

653
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:51,053
"Think about..."

654
01:13:55,685 --> 01:13:57,310
I kept on...

655
01:13:58,688 --> 01:14:01,013
...harping on about the damn wife,

656
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:05,649
telling him more about me than...

657
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,316
I should have walked out, of course.

658
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:17,914
But for some reason it seemed
important to save this one, so I go on.

659
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:23,545
"We're not so very different you and I.

660
01:14:25,256 --> 01:14:26,834
"We've both spent our lives

661
01:14:26,966 --> 01:14:30,335
"looking for the weaknesses
in one another's systems.

662
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:35,715
"Don't you think it's time to recognise

663
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:40,311
"there is as little worth on your side
as there is on mine?"

664
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,486
Never said a word.

665
01:15:02,043 --> 01:15:03,870
Not one word.

666
01:15:13,054 --> 01:15:15,759
And the next morning
he got back on his plane.

667
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:20,054
He handed the pack of cigarettes
back to me, untouched.

668
01:15:20,186 --> 01:15:24,231
This was a chain-smoker, mind.

669
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:28,521
And he flew off to what
he presumed would be his death.

670
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:34,274
He kept my lighter.

671
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:39,823
It was a gift.

672
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,201
"To George from Ann.

673
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:48,498
"All my love."

674
01:15:51,676 --> 01:15:53,336
That was Karla.

675
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:58,302
He went back to die
rather than giving in.

676
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:03,937
Yes, and that's how I know
he can be beaten.

677
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:10,102
Because he's a fanatic.

678
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:15,528
And the fanatic is always
concealing a secret doubt.

679
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:22,955
What did he look like?

680
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,167
I can't remember.

681
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:50,898
After today, Peter,

682
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:54,817
you have to assume
they're watching you.

683
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:02,695
If there's anything
you need tidied up,

684
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:09,084
now is the time.

685
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,137
Nearly done.

686
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:28,271
For God's sake.

687
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:35,609
Sometimes I think they're all
sharing the same moronic brain.

688
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:48,913
If there's someone else,
you can tell me.

689
01:17:51,504 --> 01:17:53,296
I'm a grown-up.

690
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:34,497
I know. It's just going to be
such a wonderful Christmas.

691
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:36,125
Excuse me.

692
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,684
â™?And I was too proud to give in

693
01:18:52,607 --> 01:18:58,230
â™?I had to learn the hard way

694
01:19:00,573 --> 01:19:02,613
- â™?That pride... â™?
- Peter, when you're ready

695
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:04,153
Put it on now.

696
01:19:07,205 --> 01:19:08,616
Everybody!

697
01:20:23,656 --> 01:20:25,733
- Jerry.
- George.

698
01:20:26,951 --> 01:20:28,362
- Peter.
- Jerry.

699
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:32,447
I need to talk to you.

700
01:20:32,582 --> 01:20:35,120
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.

701
01:20:36,836 --> 01:20:39,125
You were duty officer, weren't you?

702
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:43,754
Yeah. Control asked me
to man the phones that night.

703
01:20:44,844 --> 01:20:47,679
He said someone was doing
a special job for the service.

704
01:20:47,806 --> 01:20:49,597
He wanted someone he could trust.

705
01:20:50,725 --> 01:20:54,509
'Hurricane Henry set
to be ridden by Ray Walsh at 7:2...'

706
01:21:27,053 --> 01:21:28,845
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

707
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:33,387
This is from the FO resident clerk.

708
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:36,009
A Hungarian news bulletin.

709
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:38,304
"British spy, work name Ellis,

710
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,598
"travelling with false Hungarian papers,

711
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:45,396
"has attempted to kidnap an unnamed
Hungarian General in Budapest.

712
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:48,524
"He's been shot.

713
01:21:48,658 --> 01:21:50,734
"Other arrests imminent."

714
01:21:54,497 --> 01:21:56,573
Can I have a brief, please?

715
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:01,873
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

716
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:10,258
I must have a brief, sir.

717
01:22:10,388 --> 01:22:12,844
'I couldn't get a word out of Control.

718
01:22:12,974 --> 01:22:16,058
'So I followed protocol
and went for the emergency list.'

719
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:21,390
You rang my house.

720
01:22:21,524 --> 01:22:24,015
Just on the off-chance
you were back from Berlin.

721
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:25,563
What did you say?

722
01:22:26,446 --> 01:22:28,569
- 'Hello?'
- Hello, Mrs. Smiley.

723
01:22:28,698 --> 01:22:30,774
It's Jerry.
Jerry Westerby from the office.

724
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:33,197
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

725
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,404
Ann said you wasn't back yet
and that was it.

726
01:22:36,623 --> 01:22:37,702
Go on.

727
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:39,375
All hell broke loose.

728
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:41,908
Military yelling about
Hungarian tanks on the border.

729
01:22:42,045 --> 01:22:44,714
Lacon and the minister
baying at the door.

730
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:48,295
Thank Christ
Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

731
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:49,624
- Mr. Haydon.
- Not now.

732
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:51,089
Mr. Haydon!

733
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:53,676
Out!

734
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,391
- Tell me.
- I tried to get hold of you.

735
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:00,685
I got half a story
on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.

736
01:23:01,898 --> 01:23:03,772
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

737
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:10,230
Get me the Hungarian embassy.

738
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,156
You tell your masters what will happen

739
01:23:12,283 --> 01:23:14,157
if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head
is damaged.

740
01:23:14,285 --> 01:23:17,203
Get Esterhase on the phone.
Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

741
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:18,326
Yes, sir.

742
01:23:30,468 --> 01:23:33,006
Any more news on him? Sir?

743
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:39,387
Oh, God.

744
01:23:39,519 --> 01:23:42,224
We need to get down to his flat,
clear out anything linked.

745
01:24:24,522 --> 01:24:27,523
Haydon heard the news at his club?

746
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:28,931
The Savile.

747
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:31,986
At 1:30? The ticker-tape
wouldn't have been running.

748
01:24:32,113 --> 01:24:33,821
So how did he know?

749
01:24:35,408 --> 01:24:36,902
- Jesus, George.
- Peter!

750
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:39,573
- How could he have known?
- It's not what you think.

751
01:24:39,704 --> 01:24:43,619
- Then how did he know?
- He was at my house that night.

752
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:15,814
Good flight?

753
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:20,444
Yes.

754
01:25:20,578 --> 01:25:22,536
Pleasant enough.

755
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,538
I was just passing.
I thought I'd call in.

756
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:28,702
Ann was in bed.
She insisted on getting up.

757
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:31,078
She said she'd be down in a minute.

758
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:36,375
That's what I'm dropping off.
It's an awful daub really.

759
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:40,385
But Ann expressed a liking.

760
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:45,302
What's keeping her?

761
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:03,406
Keep going.

762
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:06,657
Come on, lads. Keep up.

763
01:26:09,627 --> 01:26:11,419
Come on, Bill!

764
01:26:24,517 --> 01:26:27,187
- Got your specs on, Jumbo?
- Yes, sir.

765
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:28,972
Come here.

766
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:37,521
Who's that fellow down there?

767
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,405
I don't know, sir.

768
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,610
Who is he?

769
01:26:43,745 --> 01:26:45,619
Beggar man?

770
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:47,206
Thief?

771
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:51,407
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

772
01:26:51,544 --> 01:26:55,376
Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch
of boys flogging a car round a field?

773
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:59,960
What's the matter with him?
Doesn't he like us?

774
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:03,131
I don't hold with odd-bods
hanging around.

775
01:27:03,264 --> 01:27:05,838
He might steal the Alvis.

776
01:27:05,975 --> 01:27:08,301
- Which is?
- The best car in England, sir.

777
01:27:11,898 --> 01:27:13,476
Good lad.

778
01:27:22,867 --> 01:27:26,865
How were you briefed
for the Budapest mission?

779
01:27:26,996 --> 01:27:30,033
Control asked me
to come to a flat in Kensington.

780
01:27:32,585 --> 01:27:35,255
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

781
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:39,333
And we have to find it.

782
01:27:41,302 --> 01:27:44,506
What did you make of it, Jim?

783
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,596
Control's theory?

784
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:50,764
I thought it was madness.

785
01:27:50,895 --> 01:27:55,308
I know that it is one of five men.

786
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:00,608
All I want from you is one code name.

787
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,079
Alleline.

788
01:28:11,374 --> 01:28:12,952
Tinker.

789
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:15,127
Haydon.

790
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,457
Tailor.

791
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:21,633
Bland.

792
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:25,637
Soldier.

793
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:29,933
We drop Sailor.
It's too close to Tailor.

794
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,218
And Rich Man doesn't seem
to be applicable.

795
01:28:34,272 --> 01:28:35,731
Esterhase.

796
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:39,939
Poor Man.

797
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:46,991
And the fifth?

798
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:50,781
Smiley.

799
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:56,744
I thought it was madness.

800
01:28:58,171 --> 01:29:01,291
To think that any one of you
could have been a traitor.

801
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:04,502
Absolute madness.

802
01:29:06,513 --> 01:29:09,348
'But you still went.

803
01:29:09,474 --> 01:29:11,632
'Why?'

804
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:14,935
'I went because Control
asked me to go.

805
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:17,554
'It's called doing one's duty.

806
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:33,536
'At the station I met the legman
supposed to take me to the General.

807
01:29:33,665 --> 01:29:35,704
'The waiter must have panicked.

808
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:37,707
'It was meant to be
a simple snatch job.

809
01:29:44,467 --> 01:29:47,041
'They drove me
to some military hospital,

810
01:29:47,178 --> 01:29:49,966
'and then put me on a transport plane.

811
01:29:50,098 --> 01:29:52,387
'I could tell by the stars
we were heading east.

812
01:29:56,896 --> 01:29:58,972
'Then they worked me for...

813
01:30:01,317 --> 01:30:03,773
'...I don't know how long.

814
01:30:03,903 --> 01:30:06,145
'Weeks, maybe months.'

815
01:30:46,529 --> 01:30:48,273
What did you tell them?

816
01:30:49,783 --> 01:30:51,407
Everything.

817
01:30:53,703 --> 01:30:57,618
I held on for as long as I could to let
everyone get the hell out of there.

818
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,251
Did they?

819
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:05,207
My networks in Hungary,
did they get out?

820
01:31:07,967 --> 01:31:10,044
No, they were blown.

821
01:31:12,263 --> 01:31:15,929
The story is you blew them
to save your own skin.

822
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:28,478
'After the interrogators had cleared out,
this little fellow turned up.

823

'Looked like a priest.

824
01:31:33,993 --> 01:31:36,366
'That's when they really started on me.'

825
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:40,114
What was your last line of defence, hm?

826
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:43,370
The mole.

827
01:31:44,754 --> 01:31:46,830
Control's crazy theory.

828
01:31:48,925 --> 01:31:52,460
I was going to bury that so deep
they'd never get it out of me.

829
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:57,259
- Which was a joke.
- Why?

830
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:01,307
Because they already knew.

831
01:32:01,438 --> 01:32:04,972
All they wanted to know was how far
Control had got in his investigation.

832
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:22,534
No, I don't know her.

833
01:32:43,021 --> 01:32:46,141
Did they ask about me at all?

834
01:32:46,274 --> 01:32:47,733
Yes.

835
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:50,734
The little fellow did.

836
01:32:53,031 --> 01:32:55,948
What did he say about me?

837
01:32:57,535 --> 01:32:59,742
He had this cigarette lighter.

838
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:03,910
He kept flashing it about
for me to see it.

839
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:07,452
Showed me the inscription.

840
01:33:07,587 --> 01:33:09,793
- "To George..."
- "...from Ann.

841
01:33:11,257 --> 01:33:12,965
"All my love."

842
01:33:18,848 --> 01:33:20,307
Karla.

843

'It was odd.

844

'They sent me back to England.

'Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.'

846
01:34:02,767 --> 01:34:07,762
He said when he was being debriefed
at the Nursery, he had a visitor.

847
01:34:07,897 --> 01:34:09,012
Who?

848
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:12,066
'Toby Esterhase.

849
01:34:12,193 --> 01:34:14,863
'He gave him Â£1,000 and an Alvis.'

850
01:34:15,905 --> 01:34:19,239
Told him he was dead now.
Couldn't come back.

851
01:34:19,367 --> 01:34:22,819
Had to become a lotus eater,
forget everything that happened.

852
01:34:22,954 --> 01:34:24,828
Control's theory.

853
01:34:24,956 --> 01:34:27,162
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.

854
01:34:28,626 --> 01:34:31,248
Yes, that's what I thought.

855
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:35,673
How on earth did Esterhase
hear about Tinker, Tailor?

856
01:34:52,275 --> 01:34:54,481
'Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre

857
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:57,944
'everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

858
01:34:58,073 --> 01:35:00,480
'She told me
Karla was very proud of this.

859
01:35:00,617 --> 01:35:03,820
'She said everything the Circus thinks
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

860
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:11,582

in Moscow Centre

861
01:35:11,711 --> 01:35:14,629

862
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:17,923
'No, I had a hotel nearby.
They do have some seedy rooms.

863
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:20,090

866

'She said everything
the Circus thinks is gold is shit.'

867
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:38,373
This meeting is not taking place.
Is that clear?

868
01:36:39,549 --> 01:36:41,174
Perfectly, Minister.

869
01:36:46,014 --> 01:36:51,055
There is a house
somewhere in this city

870
01:36:52,145 --> 01:36:55,894
where Alleline and the others meet
Witchcraft's London representative.

871
01:36:56,024 --> 01:36:58,147
I thought Lacon had made it
clear to you.

872
01:36:58,276 --> 01:37:01,894
Keep your nose bloody well
out of Witchcraft's business.

873
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:03,857
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

874
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:06,564
You told me
to follow in Control's footsteps.

875
01:37:06,701 --> 01:37:11,363
I wouldn't consider that sound advice,
given the mess Control left us with.

876
01:37:12,499 --> 01:37:16,710
It has taken Alleline
and, if I may say so, myself

877
01:37:16,836 --> 01:37:18,876
this long to get us back in the game.

878
01:37:20,048 --> 01:37:23,998
The man Alleline and the others
meet is called Polyakov.

879
01:37:26,596 --> 01:37:29,383
'You believe his role
is to bring information

880
01:37:29,516 --> 01:37:31,592
'from Witchcraft to you.

881
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:36,602
'His real role is to receive
information from the mole

882
01:37:36,731 --> 01:37:38,309
'to take back to Karla.'

883
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:43,062
That, er...
That's not possible.

884
01:37:43,196 --> 01:37:44,856
Made possible.

885
01:37:44,989 --> 01:37:48,405
By you in the house you persuaded
the Treasury to pay for.

886
01:37:49,285 --> 01:37:54,493
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine.
It's been gold.

887
01:37:54,624 --> 01:37:58,918
It's just enough glitter
amongst the chicken feed.

888
01:37:59,045 --> 01:38:01,916
Control didn't believe in miracles
or in Witchcraft.

889
01:38:02,048 --> 01:38:03,840
But you were lazy and greedy

890
01:38:03,967 --> 01:38:08,011
and so you hounded him
out of the Circus and you let Karla in.

891
01:38:10,724 --> 01:38:14,935
You opened negotiations to exchange
intelligence with the Americans.

892
01:38:15,061 --> 01:38:18,726
What they tell the Circus,
they'll be telling the Kremlin.

893
01:38:18,857 --> 01:38:24,313
Witchcraft's information,
the "gold" Karla let you have,

894
01:38:24,446 --> 01:38:26,569
it wasn't to lure you.

895
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:28,987
It was to lure the Americans.

896
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:32,862
Now,

897
01:38:32,996 --> 01:38:35,072
do you want to take credit for that?

898
01:38:39,586 --> 01:38:41,460
What can we do?

899
01:38:43,882 --> 01:38:47,666
We have one thing the mole wants.

900
01:38:50,889 --> 01:38:52,217
- If I go to Paris...
- You'll go.

901
01:38:52,349 --> 01:38:55,136
If I go to Paris,

902
01:38:56,895 --> 01:38:59,386
I want your word
that you will get lrina back.

903
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:04,523
I don't care who you have to trade.
And I am out.

904
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:11,319
I want a family, thank you.
I do not want to end up like you lot.

905
01:39:11,451 --> 01:39:13,776
You will get her back.

906
01:39:16,664 --> 01:39:19,156
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

907
01:39:44,192 --> 01:39:46,268
Oh, hello, George.

908
01:39:47,445 --> 01:39:48,904
Hello.

909
01:40:14,848 --> 01:40:17,255
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

910
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:23,271
Control recruited you, didn't he?

911
01:40:23,398 --> 01:40:26,565
Found you starving
in a museum in Vienna.

912
01:40:26,693 --> 01:40:29,184
A wanted man.

913
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:31,397
Saved your life, I heard.

914
01:40:32,532 --> 01:40:34,690
And yet when the time came,

915
01:40:34,826 --> 01:40:37,198
when it came to picking sides
between him and Alleline,

916
01:40:37,328 --> 01:40:39,286
you didn't hesitate.

917
01:40:40,331 --> 01:40:44,080
That's understandable, perhaps,
with your war experience.

918
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:48,956
You survived this long, I suppose,
because of your ability to change sides.

919
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:51,166
Serve any master.

920
01:40:56,806 --> 01:40:59,511
What? What's...
What's this about, George?

921
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:03,852
It's about which master
you've been serving, Toby.

922
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:10,432
'Intelligence
has been leaked, Toby.

923
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:13,441
'Someone's been taking files
from the Circus.

924
01:41:13,573 --> 01:41:15,815
'No, no, no, no. No.'

925
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:17,694
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.

926
01:41:17,827 --> 01:41:21,243
Files were delivered
to a Russian attachÃ©, weren't they?

927
01:41:21,373 --> 01:41:22,535
Yes.

928
01:41:24,376 --> 01:41:27,080
'And, yes, I delivered them.'

929
01:41:32,592 --> 01:41:34,881
'But so did Percy Alleline.'

930
01:41:39,766 --> 01:41:41,046
Good boy.

931
01:41:41,184 --> 01:41:43,260
'Bill Haydon.

932
01:41:45,021 --> 01:41:47,097
'And so did Roy Bland.'

933
01:41:56,908 --> 01:41:59,399
Things aren't always
what they seem, George.

934
01:41:59,536 --> 01:42:01,493
You should know that.

935
01:42:01,621 --> 01:42:04,077
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...

936
01:42:08,294 --> 01:42:10,287
...working for them.

937
01:42:10,422 --> 01:42:12,960
Every now and then we give him
the odd file to take back to them.

938
01:42:13,091 --> 01:42:15,499
Chicken feed,
just to keep his bosses happy.

939
01:42:17,929 --> 01:42:21,179
But Polyakov's our Joe.

940
01:42:21,307 --> 01:42:25,008
- He's a part of a big operation.
- Operation Witchcraft.

941
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:27,473
Yes, I know.

942
01:42:28,481 --> 01:42:30,141
George.

943
01:42:30,275 --> 01:42:33,110
- Please, I don't deserve this.
- Who gave you the message

944
01:42:33,236 --> 01:42:35,941
for Jim Prideaux
to forget about Tinker, Tailor?

945
01:42:36,072 --> 01:42:38,361
- Bland.
- To get rid of Connie Sachs?

946
01:42:38,491 --> 01:42:40,235
- Westerby?
- Bland.

947
01:42:40,368 --> 01:42:42,575
Or Haydon.

948
01:42:42,704 --> 01:42:44,495
I don't know. One of them.

949
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:47,622
Or maybe Percy. No.

950
01:42:47,751 --> 01:42:50,455
Well, I don't know who.

951
01:42:50,587 --> 01:42:52,793
You're just the messenger.

952
01:42:53,882 --> 01:42:56,503
Running between them all.

953
01:42:56,634 --> 01:42:59,090
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

954
01:43:00,388 --> 01:43:02,760
I know all about your secret source.

955
01:43:04,517 --> 01:43:06,593
And I know something you don't.

956
01:43:08,605 --> 01:43:10,763
I know who he is.

957
01:43:13,151 --> 01:43:15,227
He's Karla.

958
01:43:22,994 --> 01:43:27,371
'One of you has been giving
Polyakov the crown jewels.'

959
01:43:27,499 --> 01:43:30,665
- I did not know.
- Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

960
01:43:30,794 --> 01:43:34,661
- Look, George, I didn't know. I...
- You picked the wrong side.

961
01:43:34,798 --> 01:43:36,671
No, you've got to believe me.

962
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,125
George, please.

963
01:43:43,264 --> 01:43:45,423
I am loyal.

964
01:43:46,184 --> 01:43:48,509
I... I am loyal.

965
01:43:59,572 --> 01:44:02,028
Don't... Don't...
Don't send me back.

966
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:04,032
Please, George.

967
01:44:04,911 --> 01:44:06,654
Don't send me back.

968
01:44:12,168 --> 01:44:14,244
Give me the address.

969
01:44:17,465 --> 01:44:19,873
Where do you meet Polyakov?

970
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,765
Hey, hey!
Dog, dog, be quiet!

971
01:44:36,901 --> 01:44:39,689
What is this? Who are you?

972
01:44:39,821 --> 01:44:41,695
- Mrs. McCraig?
- Yes.

973
01:44:57,422 --> 01:44:59,830
- What are the safety signals?
- The air vent.

974
01:44:59,966 --> 01:45:02,374
Open and all's well,
closed and you're not to enter.

975
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:08,219
And the microphone?

976
01:45:15,148 --> 01:45:16,523
Peter?

977
01:45:33,124 --> 01:45:36,125
The boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but he had fled

978
01:45:36,252 --> 01:45:38,660
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone brightly o'er the dead

979
01:45:39,631 --> 01:45:43,047
'Beautiful and proud he stood
as born to rule the storm

980
01:45:43,176 --> 01:45:46,426
'A creature of blood,
a proud though child-like form'

981
01:45:46,554 --> 01:45:49,224
The flames rolled on...

982
01:46:00,402 --> 01:46:03,319
Merci. Au revoir.

983
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:38,021
Go on.

984
01:46:45,947 --> 01:46:47,940
The whole service is looking for you.

985
01:46:48,074 --> 01:46:51,443
- They'll skin you alive if they find you.
- Maybe I want them to find me.

986
01:46:53,163 --> 01:46:56,366
You can go now. Leave the books
and put the keys in the machines.

987
01:46:56,499 --> 01:46:59,121
No, Ben stays here.

988
01:46:59,252 --> 01:47:04,626
Ricki Tarr claims to have information
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

989
01:47:26,905 --> 01:47:28,778
'Mr. Smiley?'

990
01:47:31,284 --> 01:47:32,695
Taxi approaching Circus.

991
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:46,548
Tinker.

992
01:47:57,435 --> 01:47:59,227
Tailor.

993
01:48:04,526 --> 01:48:06,269
Here comes Soldier.

994
01:48:11,032 --> 01:48:12,657
'Full house.'

995
01:48:25,463 --> 01:48:31,252
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.
- "Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

996
01:48:32,387 --> 01:48:36,764
"Require clarification
before meeting your request.

997
01:48:37,809 --> 01:48:43,894
"Quote, information vital
to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote

998
01:48:45,191 --> 01:48:49,438
"does not qualify,
send further information."

999
01:48:49,571 --> 01:48:52,691
Ah! That's it, Percy,
you keep stalling.

1000
01:48:52,824 --> 01:48:55,659
I warn you, Ben. We've got
some really lousy people in this outfit.

1001
01:48:55,785 --> 01:48:57,992
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

1002
01:49:05,879 --> 01:49:08,085
'The meeting's over.

1003
01:49:10,508 --> 01:49:12,418
'They're leaving.'

1004
01:53:13,793 --> 01:53:16,000
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

1005
01:53:17,797 --> 01:53:21,546
I keep thinking how much
I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.

1006
01:53:28,266 --> 01:53:32,727
I was rather hoping you might do
a little light housekeeping for me.

1007
01:53:34,522 --> 01:53:36,182
If I can.

1008
01:53:36,941 --> 01:53:41,520
There's a girl.
Give her some money, would you?

1009
01:53:41,654 --> 01:53:43,861
And give her a good cover story.

1010
01:53:46,117 --> 01:53:48,904
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1011
01:53:49,037 --> 01:53:50,780
It's all there.

1012
01:53:50,914 --> 01:53:54,958
And there's a boy, too.
Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1013
01:53:57,295 --> 01:54:01,340
I know the inquisitors' bag of tricks.
I taught most of them.

1014
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:06,086
It's just a reaction.

1015
01:54:08,014 --> 01:54:10,552
An over-reaction, if you like.

1016
01:54:10,684 --> 01:54:13,353
I did have one or two questions.

1017
01:54:17,232 --> 01:54:19,105
- About Prideaux.
- Goddamn it!

1018
01:54:19,234 --> 01:54:22,151
- I got him back, didn't I?
- Yes, yes, you did.

1019
01:54:22,278 --> 01:54:24,236
That was good of you.

1020
01:54:25,323 --> 01:54:28,573
I am surprised
Karla didn't have him shot.

1021
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:32,871
Or do you think he held back,

1022
01:54:32,997 --> 01:54:35,571
out of delicacy towards you?

1023
01:54:39,254 --> 01:54:43,880
Did Prideaux come and see you
before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1024
01:54:46,386 --> 01:54:48,758
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1025
01:54:51,391 --> 01:54:53,430
To say what?

1026
01:54:58,898 --> 01:55:00,772
To warn you.

1027
01:55:02,694 --> 01:55:05,267
Because he knew deep down

1028
01:55:06,489 --> 01:55:08,399
it was you all along.

1029
01:55:12,954 --> 01:55:15,243
So did you.

1030
01:55:19,252 --> 01:55:21,660
I had to pick a side, George.

1031
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:26,625
It was an aesthetic choice
as much as a moral one.

1032
01:55:28,011 --> 01:55:31,047
And the West has become
so very ugly.

1033
01:55:32,223 --> 01:55:33,931
Don't you think?

1034
01:55:35,643 --> 01:55:39,226
Did Karla ever consider
having you take over the Circus?

1035
01:55:39,356 --> 01:55:41,681
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1036
01:55:41,816 --> 01:55:44,307
What are you, then, Bill?

1037
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:53,239
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1038
01:56:06,966 --> 01:56:11,628
Is there anything particular
you want me to pass on to Ann?

1039
01:56:15,392 --> 01:56:19,935
Oh, that was nothing personal, George.
I hope you understand that.

1040
01:56:20,063 --> 01:56:22,352
Karla said you were good,

1041
01:56:22,482 --> 01:56:25,649
the one we had to worry about.

1042
01:56:25,777 --> 01:56:29,228
But you do have a blind spot.

1043
01:56:29,364 --> 01:56:31,736
He reckoned
if I was known to be Ann's lover,

1044
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:36,119
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

1045
01:56:37,706 --> 01:56:39,579
And he was right.

1046
01:56:41,001 --> 01:56:42,958
Up to a point.

1047
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:48,256
Up to a point.

1048
01:57:15,452 --> 01:57:17,409
I made this for you, sir.

1049
01:57:26,212 --> 01:57:29,332
I don't want you
hanging around here any more.

1050
01:57:31,134 --> 01:57:33,340
Keep away from me from now on.

1051
01:57:34,721 --> 01:57:37,294
- Go and join the others.
- But...

1052
01:57:37,432 --> 01:57:40,349
Just... Just bloody join in, will you?

1053
01:57:44,022 --> 01:57:46,560
Go and play, damn you!

1054
01:58:04,084 --> 01:58:06,753
Could you check, Jerry?
