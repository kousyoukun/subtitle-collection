8
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,970
沒人跟蹤你吧
You weren't followed?

9
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,840
沒有
No.

10
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,830
快點進來
Better come in.

11
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,640
誰都不能相信  吉姆
Trust no one, Jim.

12
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,460
特別是主流派的人
Especially not in the mainstream.

13
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,260
坐下
Sit down.

14
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,360
你還有個匈牙利的身份可用對嗎
I understand you still have one Hungarian identity running?

15
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,220
是的
I do.

16
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,750
我要你去布達佩斯
I want you to go to Budapest.

17
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,060
這是秘密行動
This is not above board.

18
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,180
沒有其他人知道
Nobody else knows.

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,730
他們想要我的命  小吉姆
They're after my head, Jim boy.

20
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,750
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

21
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,910
我要給你一個任務
I have had an offer of service.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,110
有個匈牙利將軍要過來
A Hungarian general wants to come over.

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,690
我想讓你見見他
I would like you to meet him.

24
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,320
他有我要的情報  吉姆
He has some information that I need, Jim.

25
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,620
什麼情報
What information?

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,550
無價之寶
Treasure.

27
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,870
俄國人在英國情報機構
He has the name of the mole...

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,380
圓場的高層安插了一名"地鼠"
the Russians have planted in the British intelligence service...

29
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,630
他知道那個"地鼠"的名字
right at the top of the Circus.

30
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,830
有個爛蘋果  吉姆
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

31
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,130
我們得把他揪出來
We have to find it.

32
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,290
其他人呢  你認識什麼人嗎

33
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,430
是的

34
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,730
他們很靠譜  比匈牙利人好多了  但不在布達佩斯

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,500
為什麼

36
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,460
那些豬頭都去了莫斯科

37
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,300
我們什麼時候去見你那位朋友

38
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,060
他隨時都會出現

39
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,820
我能失陪一下嗎

40
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,870
站住
Stop!

41
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,580
停下  中止行動

42
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,470
你他媽在這做什麼  快去守住出口

43
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,910
把槍放下

44
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,760
你個匈牙利外行蠢豬  我說了  要你守住出口

45
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,800
看看你幹的好事  一群蠢貨

46
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,240
你們在做什麼  留在原地別動

47
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,240
我們要抓活的

48
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,440
白廳文件
秘密情報機構主管

49
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,020
你能替我做個見證嗎
Would you witness this for me?

50
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,870
我希望我能做得更多  老總
I wish I could done more, Control.

51
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,920
你已經盡力了  潘西
You did all you could, Percy.

52
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,210
人都該有自知之明
Well, a man should know when to leave the party.

53
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,250
那史邁利呢
What about Smiley?

54
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,710
史邁利和我一起走
Smiley is leaving with me.

55
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,060
伊斯特哈斯  你個白癡
You little prick, Esterhase.

56
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,990
加裡·奧德曼

57
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,420
鍋匠

58
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,420
裁縫

59
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,420
士兵

60
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,420
間諜

61
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,250
凱西·伯克

62
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,760
本尼迪克特·康伯巴奇

63
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,890
大衛·丹席克

64
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,310
科林·費斯

65
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,690
斯蒂芬·格拉漢姆

66
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,270
湯姆·哈迪

67
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,240
塞倫·希德

68
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,070
約翰·赫特

69
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,290
托比·瓊斯

70
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,750
西蒙·邁克伯尼

71
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,380
馬克·斯特朗

72
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,490
先生們  可以開始了嗎
Gentlemen, shall we start?

73
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,930
拉康副部長已經在等你了  潘西先生
Under Secretary Lacon is ready for you, Sir Percy.

74
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,860
財政部不明白
The Treasury don't understand.

75
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,220
情報部門申請經費時
Why can't the intelligence service simply put in a request

76
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,750
就不能統一申請嗎
for a general increase in funding

77
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,790
到時你再撥給自己的特別行動好了
and then you account for the spend on your special operation?

78
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,600
巫術行動必須保密
Operation Witchcraft needs to remain secret.

79
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,130
那是獨立行動  
It's a fiefdom of its own.

80
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,260
是的  我們就是擔心這點
Yes, that's what's worrying us.

81
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,260
這整件事非常不合理  是吧
The whole thing's very unaccountable, isn't it?

82
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,810
還有那所倫敦某處沒人知道在哪的房子
And this London house that nobody knows the address of,

83
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,290
這真的有必要嗎
is that really necessary?

84
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,590
很有必要  我們要保護蘇聯的情報來源
Now more than ever. We need to protect our Soviet source.

85
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,350
不然你建議我們在哪裡接頭  咖啡館嗎
So where do you propose we meet? In a cafe?

86
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,920
這所房子的租金和價格翻倍了
The rent and rates on this house have doubled.

87
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,130
我們能在核彈頭上花幾百萬
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

88
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,460
花幾千塊弄間房子反而不行
We're asking for a few thousand for a house.

89
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,530
我很好奇卡拉是不是也和
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

90
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,180
克林姆林宮的財政部有此爭議
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

91
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,880
聽著  沒有人低估
Look, nobody underestimates

92
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,520
你們所做工作的重要性
the importance of the job you chaps are doing.

93
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,750
但去年在布達佩斯的事
But what happened in Budapest last year,

94
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,030
那是一場災難
that was a disaster.

95
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,770
恕我直言  先生
With respect, sir,

96
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,850
遇害的又不是你們的公務員  對嗎
it wasn't one of your civil servants that got killed, was it?

97
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,420
現在打頭陣的已經不是士兵了
Now this isn't about soldiers in trenches any more.

98
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,600
-而是我們  -羅埃
- We're the front line now... - Roy!

99
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,210
這二十五年來  只有我們
For 25 years we've been the

100
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,490
斡旋在他們  卡拉  莫斯科
only thing standing between them and Karla

101
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,870
還有該死的第三次世界大戰之間
and Moscow and the third bloody world war.

102
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,520
大臣很滿意你們迄今取得的成就
Look, the Minister's very pleased with your progress so far.

103
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,870
但是  他卻不怎麼滿意
He's less pleased, though,

104
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,880
我們和美國之間沒什麼進展
with the lack of progress with our American cousins.

105
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,070
所以
You see,

106
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,060
在他們眼中
in their eyes,

107
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,440
你們還是一條漏水的船
you're still a leaky ship.

108
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,420
什麼事
Yes?

109
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,760
線上有人找你  先生  很緊急
Someone on the line for you, sir. Seems urgent.

110
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,250
好  接進來吧
All right, well put him through.

111
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,040
-你好  -請問是拉康副部長嗎
- Hello? - Is this Under Secretary Lacon?

112
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,700
是的
Yes.

113
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,190
我是裡基·塔爾
My name's Ricki Tarr.

114
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,390
-你有什麼事  -我要見你
- What do you want? - I need to meet you.

115
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,330
如果你要確認我的身份
If you need to confirm who I am,

116
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,800
你可以找我在圓場的上司
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

117
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,900
彼得·吉勒姆
Peter Guillam.

118
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,630
但只能找吉勒姆  別人都不行
But only Guillam, no one else.

119
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,420
他們允許你把這個帶進來嗎
You got clearance for that?

120
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,860
我才不要把它鎖在外面
Well, I'm not bloody chaining it up outside.

121
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,910
小心  就算在裡面你也得鎖好
Mind you, no better off in

122
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,870
那些剝頭皮組的傢伙們
here with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

123
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,250
會把你牙齒上的金子都刮下來
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

124
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,580
我想我該在布蘭德出手之前
Thought I'd pop in and catch a

125
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,770
先看一眼那個新來的女孩子
glimpse of the new girl before Bland gets to her.

126
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,140
是啊  金髮美人布琳達
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

127
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,260
-他見過她了嗎  -當然
- Has he seen her yet? - Of course he has.

128
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
早上一來就去了
Came down first thing this morning.

129
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,440
布琳達
Belinda.

130
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,280
我是彼得·吉勒姆  
Peter Guillam.

131
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,840
你好  彼得  我是奧利弗
Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

132
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,960
我打電話來是想
Just ringing to find out...

133
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,490
所以溫斯頓·丘吉爾救了你一命  愛迪
So Winston Churchill saved your life, Edie.

134
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,290
我當時在廚房準備晚餐
I was working in the kitchen, getting dinner ready.

135
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,840
而他遲到了
And he was late, you see.

136
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,920
-當時在空襲呢  -在空襲的時候
- During a raid? - During a raid, you see.

137
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,560
他說 "你怎麼不進掩體"
He said, "Why aren't you in that shelter?"

138
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,500
-你不也沒去嗎  -因為...
- Why weren't you? - Well, because...

139
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,450
老總的事我很遺憾  史邁利先生
I was sorry to hear about Control, Mr. Smiley.

140
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,330
他說塔爾從一個電話亭給他打電話
He said Tarr called him from a phone box.

141
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,090
他說有個間諜
He said there's a mole,

142
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,370
潛伏在圓場高層
right at the top of the Circus,

143
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,900
已經潛伏了很多年
that he's been there for years.

144
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,170
這就意味著
It does mean

145
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,570
你是替我們調查此事的最佳人選
you're rather well placed to look into this matter for us now,

146
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,270
不是嗎
doesn't it?

147
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,330
局外人
Outside the family.

148
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,570
我退休了  奧利弗
I'm retired, Oliver.

149
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,460
你開除了我
You fired me.

150
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,970
其實
The thing is,

151
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,560
老總去世之前
some time ago before Control died,

152
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,860
他和我提過類似的暗示
he came to me with a similar suggestion.

153
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,780
有"地鼠"的存在
That there is a mole.

154
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,510
他從沒和你說起過他的疑問嗎
He never mentioned his suspicions to you?

155
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,920
沒有
No.

156
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,410
我只是想  你可以說是他的人...
Oh, I just thought that as you were his man, so to speak...

157
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,700
你跟他說了什麼
What did you say to him?

158
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,900
我不得不認為
I'm afraid I thought his

159
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,820
他的偏執已經沒治了
paranoia had rather gotten the better of him

160
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,100
他會毀了他的整個機構
and he was going to pull his whole house down.

161
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,040
布達佩斯的爛攤子
That bloody mess in Budapest.

162
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,610
見鬼  喬治
Damn it, George.

163
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,310
那是你的一代  你的遺產
It's your generation, your legacy.

164
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,010
我本來以為
I would have thought,

165
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,430
至少這一切都是真的  而你會...
if there's any truth in it, you'd want to...

166
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,660
我需要彼得
I'll keep Peter.

167
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,420
還有個退休的督察長  孟德爾
And there's a retired Special Branch man, Mendel.

168
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,560
我也需要他
I should like to have him.

169
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,710
抬起來
Lift up.

170
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,060
再馬上放下
And quickly down again.

171
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,070
我知道一個地方  先生
There's a place I know, sir.

172
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,300
利物浦大街附近有個小旅館
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

173
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,290
請小心使用  這是喬治王時期的傢俱
Be careful with it. Please. It's Georgian.

174
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,150
我這位朋友的工作
My friend wants peace and quiet

175
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,330
需要安靜的環境  波普格拉漢太太
in order to work, Mrs. Pope Graham.

176
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,530
不要他人打擾
No disturbances.

177
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,560
她的姓氏就是普通的格拉漢
Her real name is just Graham.

178
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,160
Pope意為教皇

179
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,160
加上波普只是為了聽起來威風一些
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

180
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,700
彼得  你有老總公寓的鑰匙嗎
Peter, did you get the keys to Control's flat?

181
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,740
這些古時的足跡
And did those feet in ancient time

182
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,820
是否穿越了英格蘭翠綠的山巒
walk upon England's mountains green?

183
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,220
喬治
George!

184
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,820
喬治  過來
George, get in here!

185
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,830
喬治
George.

186
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,320
坐下
Sit down.

187
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,770
看看這些亂七八糟的東西
Take a look at this nonsense.

188
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,220
這是蘇聯統帥部關於他們
Report by Soviet high command

189
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,220
最近在黑海海軍演習的報告
on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea.

190
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,310
就是海軍部一直追著我們
Just what the admiralty has been begging us

191
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,850
管我們要的情報
for some information on.

192
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,630
-你怎麼弄到的  -不是我弄到的
- Where did you get this? - I didn't.

193
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,050
是潘西和他的小集團弄來的
Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.

194
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,570
-聽著  老總  -閉嘴
- Look, Control... - Shut up.

195
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,120
真是駭人聽聞
Style appalling.

196
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,710
這個怎麼看都顯然是假的
Patently a fabrication from beginning to end.

197
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,810
那沒準就是真的
Just could be the real thing.

198
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,160
如果是真的  那就有金子般的價值
Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

199
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,400
但是它的時事性太可疑了
But its topicality makes it suspect.

200
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,200
史邁利懷疑了  潘西
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

201
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,510
這是從哪弄來的  通過什麼渠道
Where did it come from? What's the access?

202
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,850
我有條新的秘密情報來源
A new secret source of mine.

203
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,670
但對方又是通過什麼渠道
But how could he possibly have access?

204
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,010
他能接觸到最機密的決策層
He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy-making.

205
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,540
我們稱其為巫術行動
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

206
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,770
潘西和他的人越過我們  史邁利
Oh, Percy and his pals bypassed us, Smiley.

207
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,630
直接向大臣匯報了
Gone straight to the minister.

208
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,600
而他允許潘西對他新朋友的身份保密
Percy has been allowed to keep the identity of his new friend

209
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,700
最高機密
top secret.

210
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,290
大臣也認為圓場洩露的秘密太多了
The minister agrees too many secrets are blown around here.

211
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,590
太多的失敗和醜聞
Too much failure, too many scandals.

212
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,090
可靠的情報卻少得可憐
Too little solid intelligence.

213
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,640
潘西說的有道理  老總
Percy does have a point, Control.

214
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,960
我們的敵人是共產主義  不能內訌
We should be fighting Communism, not each other.

215
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,510
而且我們也同時在失去信譽和夥伴
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners.

216
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,100
你這美國佬的跟屁蟲
Your bloody Yanks!

217
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,040
我們損失夠大了  該要有所改變了
We've had enough! There's going to be changes.

218
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,050
我們得做出決定
We need to decide if want

219
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,580
到底是過去重要還是未來重要
to be part of the past or part of the future.

220
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,210
當初我真不該救你
I should have left you where I found you.

221
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,710
-聽著  -老總
- Look! - Control...

222
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,920
出去  都出去
Out, all of you!

223
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,130
如果巫師的情報是真的
If Witchcraft is genuine...

224
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,630
已經沒有什麼真的東西了
Nothing is genuine any more.

225
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,240
喬治
George...

226
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,730
你要我把這些搬到旅館去嗎
Do you want me to get this stuff over to the hotel?

227
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,220
艾萊旅館

228
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,330
謝謝  隨便放哪裡
Thank you. Uh, anywhere will do.

229
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,230
彼得
Peter?

230
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,570
我要你幫我辦件事
I need you to do something for me.

231
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,500
卡拉

232
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,970
我要你去一趟圓場
I'd like you to go to the Circus.

233
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,120
值班辦公室的櫥櫃裡
In the cabinet at the duty officers' station

234
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,820
有最近退休人員的記錄
are records of staff recently retired.

235
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,840
我要他們的照片
I'd like photographs of them

236
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,990
還有潘西·阿勒萊恩
and of the diagram of the

237
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,560
重組下圓場的機構圖
Circus's reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

238
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,370
和"爬蟲"資金的所有支出
along with a list of all payments made from the Reptile fund.

239
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,330
在皇家劇院附近的街角有家咖啡館

240
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,000
是的  三點三刻

241
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,010
不行  我沒這時間

242
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,740
我知道

243
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,420
我知道這看上去是怎麼回事

244
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,440
有什麼要幫忙的嗎  比爾
Help you with anything, Bill?

245
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,540
我只是在找首長大人
I was just looking for his Majesty.

246
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,350
他去防衛牆散步了
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

247
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,110
真是盡職盡責

248
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,030
聽說你出了點意外  彼得
Heard you had an accident, Peter.

249
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,240
是啊  我的手被抽屜劃到了
Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

250
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,440
我們這兒什麼時候換點新傢俱
When are you going to get some new furniture up here?

251
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,410
我會告訴伊斯特哈斯
I'll have a word with Esterhase.

252
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,920
我們會優先考慮頂樓
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.

253
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,910
-你現在去做什麼  -吃飯
- Where are you off to? - Lunch.

254
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,620
一起嗎
Want some company?

255
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,480
根據人事檔案
According to the personnel files,

256
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,310
有七個人退休了
seven were due for retirement anyway.

257
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,820
其餘四人看起來沒什麼特別
Another four don't seem particularly mysterious.

258
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,600
傑裡·威斯特貝於12月4日被開除
Jerry Westerby was dismissed December 4.

259
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,680
康妮·沙赫斯在11月28日退休了
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

260
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,460
正是你和老總被迫離開的兩周後
That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.

261
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,510
-回牛津  謝謝  -一塊一毛五
- Return to Oxford, please. - That's 1.15.

262
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,930
潘西一直以來都不同意
Percy has always resisted any proposal

263
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,890
對巫師情報的進一步開採
of a wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.

264
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,790
別用該死的術語  拉康
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

265
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,040
此前我一直拒絕將巫師情報
I've refused to share

266
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,510
同我們的盟友分享  大臣
Witchcraft with our allies so far, Minister.

267
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,730
貪心的傢伙 
Greedy boy.

268
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,900
我的目標是力排眾議  確立巫師情報的價值
My goal has been to establish its track record beyond all doubt.

269
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,940
我覺得現在是時候
I think the time has come

270
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,830
接觸我們的美國盟友了
to approach our American brothers-in-arms.

271
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,860
他們還對我們感興趣嗎
Will they take us back into bed?

272
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,150
我對一次性交易沒興趣
I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

273
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,850
我要能打進美國情報部門的渠道
I want on-going access to American intelligence.

274
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,140
你覺得我們搞得到嗎
You think we can get it?

275
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,320
只要有巫術情報
With Witchcraft on our side,

276
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,420
我們要什麼就有什麼
we can get anything we bloody well want.

277
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,740
好吧
Fine.

278
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,400
那就去吧
Carry on.

279
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,190
沙赫斯

280
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,950
謝謝
Thank you.

281
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,830
我將你擊倒
And I strike thee down...

282
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,080
那個
Oh, I, uh...

283
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,010
這可不行  謹遵醫囑
Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.

284
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,600
淘氣的喬治
Wicked, wicked George.

285
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,590
我不知道你怎麼樣  喬治
I don't know about you, George,

286
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,560
但我真覺得自己糟透了
but I feel seriously under-fucked.

287
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,340
我聽說安恩又離開你了
I heard Ann left you again.

288
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,700
她配不上你  喬治  一絲一毫都配不上
She doesn't deserve you, George, not one hair on your head.

289
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,400
我退休後不久你就離開了圓場
You left the Circus shortly after I retired.

290
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,020
我沒離開  我是被開除了
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

291
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,560
像垃圾一樣被掃地出門  就像你一樣
Chucked out on the rubbish heap, like you.

292
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,150
為什麼
Why?

293
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,120
波裡雅科夫
Polyakov.

294
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,460
你記得他嗎
Do you remember him?'

295
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,070
蘇聯大使館的人
From the Soviet Embassy?'

296
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,100
阿力克賽·波裡雅科夫  蘇聯駐倫敦大使館的文化參事
Alexsey Polyakov, cultural attach here in London.

297
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,400
他十五年前到這裡的時候
When he arrived here 15 years ago,

298
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,030
我曾要求徹查他的身份
I requested he be checked out.

299
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,650
他比白紙還要清白  從沒做錯過事
He was graded whiter than white. Didn't put a foot wrong.

300
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,450
但是你不同意嗎
But you disagreed?'

301
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,670
你肯定聽說過這麼個說法
There's a story you must have heard

302
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,210
卡拉建立了一個秘密團體
that Karla has set up a secret cell.

303
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,740
成員都是退役軍人
The personnel are all ex-military,

304
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,120
受訓前來接應深度潛伏的間諜  "地鼠"
trained to handle deep-penetration agents, moles.

305
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,810
各種說法多了去了  康妮
There are always stories, Connie.

306
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,690
但萬一這個說法是真的呢
But what if this story was true?

307
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,950
我只研究了一晚  就發現了問題  喬治
One night in research I saw something, George.

308
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:42,010
那個波裡雅科夫在柏林勞動節的遊行上
There was our friend Polyakov at a May day parade in Berlin

309
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,070
接受敬禮
receiving a salute.

310
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,650
怎麼會有人給文化參事敬禮
Why would you salute a cultural attach?

311
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:51,550
沒錯  除非他自己就是個老兵
Exactly. Unless he was a war veteran himself'.

312
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,310
如果他是  又為何要隱瞞事實
And if he was, why hide the fact?

313
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,850
你當時做了什麼
What did you do?

314
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,060
我直接去找了伊斯特哈斯和阿勒萊恩
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

315
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,510
就是這裡
Here.

316
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,610
波裡雅科夫肯定是卡拉訓練出來的人
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood if ever I saw one.

317
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,000
要是他來到這裡  肯定是為了地鼠
If he's here, it must be because he's running a mole.

318
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,780
波裡雅科夫的事你就別管了
You're to leave Polyakov alone.

319
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,140
你太過糾結他的問題了
You're becoming obsessed with him.

320
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,680
你已經失去了判斷力 康妮
You're losing your sense of proportion,Connie.

321
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,850
這太荒謬了
But that's ridiculous.

322
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,510
該是讓你到現實世界去見識見識的時候了
Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world.

323
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,060
阿力克塞·亞歷山德羅維奇
波裡雅科夫

324
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,810
有什麼關係  反正以前的圓場一去不返了
What does it matter? Old Circus is gone anyway.

325
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,360
看看我們
Here we are.

326
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,310
當時多麼年輕
The nursery in our day.

327
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,910
吉姆·普萊多
Jim Prideaux.

328
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,010
當然和比爾·海頓在一起
And Bill Haydon. Together, of course.

329
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,790
形影不離的一對
The inseparables.

330
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,120
這是老總他本人
There's Control himself.

331
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,030
都是我的男孩
All my boys.

332
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,730
聰明可愛的男孩
All my lovely boys.

333
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,710
美好的圓場舊時光  喬治
That was a good time, George.

334
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,620
當時是戰爭  康妮
It was the war, Connie.

335
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,960
真正的戰爭
A real war.

336
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,040
英國人都能引以為傲
Englishmen could be proud then.

337
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,250
所以我的判斷沒錯吧
So I was right, then?

338
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,890
波裡雅科夫的事
About Polyakov.

339
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,160
真的有個"地鼠"
There is a mole.

340
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,660
要是真的話  就別回來了
If it's bad, don't come back.

341
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,150
我不想破壞大家的美好形象
I want to remember you all as you were.

342
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,370
潘西  是你調的酒嗎
Percy? Percy, did you mix this?

343
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,130
對  是我
Aye, I did so.

344
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,940
你個加爾文派  吝嗇的蘇格蘭佬
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

345
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,760
你就不懂好好服從命令嗎
Can you nae learn to take a bloody order?

346
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,410
誰都不能亂改配方
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

347
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,550
-我就是按配方調的  -得了你
- I followed the recipe. - Come on.

348
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,880
這種貓尿喝幾個鐘頭也沒有感覺
It'll take us five hours to get drunk on this monkey's piss.

349
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,150
他並非第一
He's not the first

350
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,820
他並非頭名
He's not the first

351
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,550
-他是排名第二的最佳特工  -聖誕快樂
- He's the second best secret agent - Merry Christmas.

352
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,250
情報界的第二名
In the whole wide world

353
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,850
雖然不是頭名
He's not number one

354
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,660
卻也並非平庸
But not the worst

355
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,200
他是排名第二的最佳特工
He's just the second best secret agent

356
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,730
情報界的第二名
In the whole wide world

357
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,340
他舉止優雅
He's every bit

358
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,100
堪比那位四處留情
As good as what's-his-name

359
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,240
風流倜儻的
With a dame

360
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,740
情報大俠
Any dame

361
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,120
但他那件佈滿彈孔的馬甲
And all those bullet holes are in his vest

362
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,220
告訴大家  如果你還是榜眼
To prove you work a little harder

363
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,960
那就接著努力吧...
When you're second best... ?

364
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,790
赫魯曉夫辭職後的第二天

365
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:33,870
他在家裡  突然電話鈴響了

366
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,470
"喂"  沒人說話

367
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,750
"喂  我在聽呢"  還是沒人說話

368
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,760
"快說話  我在聽呢"

369
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,900
對方回復  你很久以前就該聽了  親愛的

370
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,490
波太太的小意思
Courtesy of Mrs. P.

371
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,840
你整晚沒睡嗎
You been up all night?

372
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,110
是的
Yes.

373
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,430
這是什麼
What's this?

374
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,460
從"爬蟲基金"支取一千鎊的申請
Request for £1,000 in cash from the Reptile fund.

375
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,800
付給一位埃利斯先生
To a Mr. Ellis.

376
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,640
這是吉姆·普萊多的一個化名
It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.

377
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,890
普萊多一年前在匈牙利被殺
Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago.

378
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,870
10月21日
October 21.

379
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,100
那為何有人在兩個月後給他一千鎊
So why was someone giving him £1,000 two months later?

380
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,680
我想知道他現在哪兒  先生
I wonder where he is then, sir.

381
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,240
該死的車呢  我們不能讓他死了  快行動

382
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,850
坐好了
Settle down now.

383
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,720
-發下去  -好的  先生
- Hand those out. - Sir.

384
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,710
這是什麼  《巴黎聖母院》嗎
What is it? The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?

385
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,840
當  當  當
The bells, the bells!

386
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,900
出來
Come here.

387
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,270
-你叫什麼  -羅奇  比爾·羅奇  先生
- What's your name? - Roach. Bill Roach, sir.

388
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,040
-我是新生  -新來的啊
- I'm a new boy. - New arrival, eh?

389
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,010
-為什麼轉學  -是我媽媽和爸爸
- What's the story? - My mother and father.

390
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,370
我爸爸走了  所以...
My father left, so...

391
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,590
比爾
Bill.

392
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,680
沒付的賬單
The unpaid Bill.

393
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,680
比爾[Bill]又意為賬單

394
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,620
-有人這麼叫過你嗎  -沒有  先生
- Anyone ever call you that? - No, sir.

395
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,280
我認識不少叫比爾的人
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

396
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,470
他們都是好樣的
They've all been good 'uns.

397
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,880
你有什麼特長
What are you good at?

398
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,740
沒有  先生
Nothing, sir.

399
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,320
可你觀察很仔細吧
You're a good watcher, though, eh?

400
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,540
咱們獨來獨往的人都這樣
Us loners always are.

401
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,450
我敢打賭  比爾·羅奇是全校觀察最仔細的人
Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet.

402
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,360
-只要戴著眼鏡  是嗎  -是的  先生
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right? - Yes, sir.

403
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,220
很好  非常好
This is good, very good.

404
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,020
你好  裡基
Hello, Ricki.

405
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,240
你沒看到門上的小木楔
You've missed the wedge.

406
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,630
你上哪去了  裡基
Where have you been, Ricki?

407
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,170
有人要殺我
They're going to kill me.

408
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,630
-誰  -你們
- Who is? - Your lot.

409
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,630
或是別人  遲早的問題
Or their lot. Whoever gets me first.

410
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,040
我是無辜的
I'm innocent.

411
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,420
我有我的理由
Within reason.

412
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,430
你進來多久了
How long have you been here?

413
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,670
抱歉  我實在走投無路了
Sorry, I've run out of places now.

414
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,990
我必須來找你
I needed to see you.

415
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,460
為什麼
Why?

416
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,130
有個女人
There's a woman.

417
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,880
我要你把她換回來
I need you to trade for her.

418
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,800
把她從卡拉那裡救回來
I need you to get her back off Karla.

419
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,400
什麼女人
A woman?

420
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,570
她叫伊琳娜
Her name's Irina.

421
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,180
去年11月
This was last November.

422
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,870
吉勒姆先生派我去伊斯坦布爾
Mr. Guillam sent me to

423
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:12,280
試探一個俄羅斯貿易代表
Istanbul to check out a Russian trade delegate

424
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,430
說是可以策反
who might be persuaded to defect.

425
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:17,740
-塔夫蒂·西辛格  駐地情報員  -對
- Tufty Thesinger, resident. - Yeah.

426
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,170
-你好  裡基  -好啊  夥計
- Hiya, Ricki. - All right, mate?

427
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,830
-你認識他嗎  -不  沒見過
- Did you know him? - No, never met him.

428
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,600
是個酒鬼
Bit of a drinker.

429
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,450
醉得差點爬不起來
Hangover from hell.

430
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,220
也是個傻逼
Bit of a fucking idiot.

431
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,020
而那個俄國佬叫鮑裡斯
Apparently this Russian, name of Boris,

432
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,420
一看就是天天在夜店裡胡混
was spending high and wide in the nightclubs.

433
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,200
這麼說你是去策反鮑裡斯的了
So you were sent to persuade this Boris?

434
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,560
對  他是那種典型的俄國人
Yeah. He was your typical Russian.

435
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,510
白天做貿易代表  然後去夜店豪飲
Trade delegation by day, out boozing every night.

436
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,600
好像從來不睡覺
Didn't seem to sleep.

437
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,210
塔夫蒂盯他梢盯得腿都站不直了
Tufty was worn out from following him around.

438
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,090
我看又是個漫漫長夜啊  小子
I think it's going to be a long night, son.

439
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,870
他最愛去塔克西姆的一家夜店
His favourite haunt was this club in Taksim.

440
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,310
那裡有間破爛的地下室
It had a hellhole in the

441
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,750
水手和遊客都愛去那裡
basement where the sailors and the tourists went.

442
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,610
總之  看他一眼我就知道這趟白跑了
Anyway, I took one look at him and I knew I'd wasted a journey.

443
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,120
鮑裡斯不是什麼代表
Boris was no delegate.

444
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,680
哪門子貿易代表會真醉了還在裝醉
What delegate bothers to play drunker than he really is?

445
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,180
我們總得認出自己的同類吧  史邁利先生
You get to recognise your own, don't you, Mr. Smiley?

446
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,560
鮑裡斯就是個間諜
And Boris was a hood.

447
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,560
是莫斯科中心訓練出來的
Moscow Centre trained.

448
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,750
茫茫人海
Someone is waiting

449
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,780
定有人為你等待
I mean just for you

450
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,130
紡車穿梭
Spinning wheel

451
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,990
牽走你所有陰霾
Keep on spinning through, drop all your troubles...

452
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,990
我想他是在等著接頭
I guessed he was waiting for a connect.

453
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,350
也許就是利用郵筒
Working a letterbox, maybe.

454
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,910
或是乾脆故意挑釁
Or trailing his coat and

455
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,970
等著我這種笨蛋主動送上門
looking for a pass from some mug like me.

456
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,060
於是第二天晚上我去了進出口公司
So the second night I went to the import/export outfit

457
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,160
塔夫蒂在那裡暗藏了一個密電室
that Tufty had set up with a cipher room hidden in the back.

458
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:57,570
我給吉勒姆先生發報  內容是"非賣品"
I cabled "No sale" to Mr. Guillam.

459
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,600
就是這樣
And that was that.

460
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,870
第二天你就該飛回英國
You were due to fly home the next day.

461
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,860
是的
Yes.

462
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,810
可是你沒有
But you didn't.

463
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,240
鮑裡斯有個妻子
Boris had a wife.

464
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,060
露水夫妻
Common-law.

465
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,130
顯然她也是正式的代表團成員
Apparently she was a member of the delegation in her own right.

466
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,860
你說過要我相信對女人的直覺  史邁利先生
You once told me to trust my instincts about women, Mr. Smiley.

467
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,770
而直覺告訴我  這個女人有利用價值
Well, my instincts told me this woman had some treasure.

468
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,700
那天晚上鮑裡斯出去後
When Boris went out for the night,

469
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,450
我潛入了她住的酒店
I found myself going into her hotel.

470
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,310
所以你沒去盯鮑裡斯
So you dropped Boris.

471
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,960
我知道這違反了規定
I know. It was breaking protocol.

472
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,950
可我也是在謀求主動  可以這麼說吧
But I was acting on my own initiative, as it were.

473
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,360
你先生可真是個混賬  不是嗎
Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?

474
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,250
我只是想來看看你好不好
I just wanted to make sure you were all right, OK?

475
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,130
所以你才不回來嗎
So you didn't come home?

476
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,500
我本來是要回來
I would have.

477
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,120
策反鮑裡斯是沒戲了
Boris was a dead end, but...

478
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,530
但我能
I could...

479
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,560
感覺到她身上藏著什麼
I could sense something in her.

480
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,210
藏著秘密
A secret.

481
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:32,320
那你準備如何套出這個秘密
And how did you intend to get this secret out of her?

482
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,990
我假扮成一個叫邁克·特倫奇的商人
I played this businessman, Michael Trench.

483
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,010
浪漫的假日邂逅
Holiday romance.

484
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,130
我本想花些心思慢慢來
I thought I'd take my time with it.

485
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,100
我知道你是什麼人
I know who you are.

486
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,510
我想和你的上司談
I want to talk to your boss.

487
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,210
那個老總
Control.

488
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,990
我有情報交換
I have something to trade.

489
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,270
驚天內幕
Something big.

490
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,180
我想在西方開始新生活
I want a new life in the West.

491
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,170
這交易如何
That's the deal.

492
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,710
你去匯報吧
You tell them.

493
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:25,570
聽著  你別以為只要有情報他們就會重視
Look, you can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.

494
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,380
如果你不透露更多  我也無計可施
If you won't tell me more, there is nothing I can do.

495
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,540
我要是都說了
If I tell you everything,

496
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,740
就是把自己的性命交給你了
I'm putting my life in your hands.

497
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,790
還有其他人的性命
And the lives of other people.

498
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,510
於是她告訴了我那個情報
So she told me what she had to trade.

499
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,530
她的秘密
Her secret.

500
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,720
我是說
I mean,

501
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,250
那個驚天的秘密
the mother of all secrets.

502
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,440
我告訴她我會警告圓場
I told her I'd alert the Circus.

503
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:07,950
可她要我保證
She made me promise I

504
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,330
絕不向倫敦方面透露任何細節
wouldn't give any of the details to London.

505
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,180
-你同意了嗎  -同意了
- And you agreed? - Yes.

506
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:15,970
我是說
I mean it was...

507
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,770
我簡直不敢相信我抓住了這麼一條大魚
I couldn't believe I'd got hold of something this big.

508
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,840
於是我回到進出口公司
I went back to the import/export,

509
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,240
向圓場發報
sent the message to the Circus,

510
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,490
級別為"注意  最高優先級"
graded, "Flash, highest priority",

511
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,810
只說了"有中心間諜想要投誠"
just that I had a Moscow-trained hood wanting to defect.

512
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:35,210
你早該走了  倫敦站抓著我不放
You're supposed to have gone. London stations have been on to me.

513
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,250
要搞清楚你到底在搞什麼鬼
Want to know what the hell you're doing.

514
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,730
滾開
Fuck off.

515
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,420
還有嗎  裡基
Anything else, Ricki?

516
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,360
我知道自己在圓場的地位  
I know what I am to the Circus.

517
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,660
就是在剝頭皮組跑腿
I'm one of the scalp-hunters,

518
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,510
替你們處理些雜七雜八的齷齪事
someone that you can hand your dirty little jobs to.

519
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,310
我只是
I just...

520
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,650
我只是想親自處理這份情報
I just wanted to bring this one in myself.

521
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,810
我理解你的感受
Well, I understand how you felt.

522
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,520
你想要有所作為
You wanted to do something.

523
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,520
我說她自稱掌握
I said that she claimed to have information

524
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,000
對保障圓場至關緊要的情報
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

525
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,260
還有嗎
Anything more?

526
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,200
我說她有關於一名雙重間諜的情報
I said that she had information concerning a double agent.

527
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,190
我只是想讓他們引起重視  而且我
Look, I just wanted to get the proper attention. And I'd...

528
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,760
我還說這是我沒有按時回國的原因
I told them this was the reason why I had not come home.

529
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,860
不是因為我變節了
It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.

530
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,820
-之後你做了什麼  -我一直在等答覆
- What did you do then? - I waited for a reply.

531
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,710
我等了幾個小時  之後聽到了封齋的晨禱聲
I hung around for hours. I heard the Imsak call to prayer.

532
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,250
那說明已經大概凌晨三點半了
So what's that? That's about 3.30 in the morning.

533
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,140
這時候報文傳過來了
Then the message comes through.

534
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,950
"已知悉"
"We read you".

535
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,270
就回了這三個字  沒了
That was all they sent. Nothing.

536
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,640
這沒道理  感覺他們在拖延什麼
It didn't make sense. It was like they were stalling'.

537
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,250
之後發生了什麼
Then what happened?

538
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,560
之後很突然地
Then, all of a sudden...

539
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,330
俄國人開始行動了
the Russians begin to move.

540
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,760
手法很老道  就算我做也不過如此
It was nice work. I couldn't have done it better myself.

541
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,490
這信號再明顯不過了  我得警告她
The message was quite clear. I needed to warn her.

542
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,040
哈桑  我能用下你的電話嗎

543
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,530
好  用那台吧

544
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,730
接啊  快接啊  快點
Come on, come on, come on.

545
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:50,540
我四處都找遍了
I've looked for everywhere.

546
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,740
我在機場找不到她
I couldn't find her at the airport.

547
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,820
我甚至翻遍了所有航班表  然後
I even looked through all the flight lists and...

548
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,120
我去了港口
I headed down to the harbour.

549
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,310
他們把她弄上了一艘去敖德薩的輪船
They put her on a ship to Odessa.

550
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,870
我只知道這些了
That's all I know.

551
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,300
我...
I've...

552
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,550
這輩子做過很多壞事  可史邁利先生
I've done a lot of things in my life, Mr. Smiley, but...

553
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,780
我就是沒法不去想她
I just... I can't stop thinking about her.

554
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,070
她都不是我喜歡的類型
She wasn't even my type.

555
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,740
我必須救她出來  我欠她的
I've got to get her out. I owe her that.

556
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,850
卡拉會來追殺你
Karla will be looking for you.

人人都在追殺我
Everybody's looking for me.

558
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,480
你不能待在這裡
You can't stay here.

559
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:19,410
這裡不安全
It isn't safe.

560
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,070
我說  你可以不爽我
I said, "You may fuck me

561
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,280
可明天一早還得對我畢恭畢敬
but you'll call me "Sir" in the morning".

562
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,990
好吧
OK.

563
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,120
這件事得告訴你
Just need to let you know.

564
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,200
有人上周飛往巴黎
Someone flew into Paris

565
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,890
用的是一本上了黑名單的護照

幹嘛告訴我這件事
Why are you telling me?

568
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,900
-這也許是巧合  -你個腦殘侏儒
- It could be coincidence... - You are a poisoned dwarf.

569
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,330
怎麼不去討好你的首長
Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

570
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,800
別拉我和你們一起演這出鬧劇
and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?

571
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:57,090
伊斯特哈斯先生說  這也許是巧合  但是
Mr. Esterhase: "It could be coincidence but"...

572
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,860
海頓先生打斷說
Mr. Haydon interrupting.

托比你個腦殘侏儒

574
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,950
怎麼不去討好你首長
"Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

575
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,900
別拉我和你們一起演這出鬧劇
"and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?"

576
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,270
你有點憔悴
You look tired.

577
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,720
我沒睡好
I didn't sleep well.

578
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:33,260
我要你幫我做點事  彼得
You're going to do something for me, Peter.

579
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:37,930

I need the duty officer's log book for last November.

580
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,650
所以你得再到樓上去  深入虎穴
I'm going to have to send you up a floor into the lions' den.

581
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,200
要是你被抓住
If you're caught,

582
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,150
你不能提到我
you can't mention me.

583
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,130
我很抱歉  但你沒有幫手
I'm sorry, but you're alone.

584
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,590
-去年11月嗎  -對
- Last November? - Hm.

585
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,040

能找下吉勒姆先生嗎
Can I speak to Mr. Guillam, please?

612
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,650
我是幫他修車的人
I'm his car mechanic.

613

614
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,740
老吳  哪裡是我的前途
Mr. Wu, what shall I do?

-老天爺  -你的電話  先生

請
Sir?

618
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,630
-你好  -先生  您的變速箱壞了
- Hello? - Your gearbox is bust, sir.

619
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,870
該死  你不能修好那玩意嗎
Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?

620
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,250
修不了  先生
Can't be done, sir.

621
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,560
恐怕您得換個新的了
Afraid you're gonna need a new gearbox.

622
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,300
那先給大車行打個電話  你有號碼嗎
Well, phone the main dealership first. Have you got their number?

623
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,310
沒有
No.

624
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,840

你能來一下嗎
Could we see you, please?

635
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,250
潘西有急事要找你
Percy would like quite an urgent word with you.

636
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:59,050
要是你現在到五樓來的話  那就再好不過了
If you can come now to the fifth floor that would be so kind.

637
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,600
當然
Yes, of course.

638
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,100
請幫我把這個放到升降機裡
Throw that into the lift for me.

639
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,690
送到二樓  我不想再填什麼狗屁單子了
Send it to the second floor, save me filling out bloody chits.

640
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:08,830
好的  先生
Will do, sir.

641
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:31,110
你這幾天到鄉下去幹什麼
So what have you been getting up to down there these days?

642
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,830
除了追逐當地的處女
Apart from chasing our virgins.

643
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:38,210
有兩個阿拉伯人看來很有希望
A couple of Arab ploys that look quite promising.

644
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,530
還有  我的乒乓球越打越順了
Apart from that, I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

645
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,150
阿拉伯人
Arabs.

646
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,570
阿拉伯人從來就不可靠  是不是  比爾
You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right, Bill?

647
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:52,790
裡基·塔爾最近如何
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

648
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,630
很好  我們每天都去福特納喝下午茶
Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.

649
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,230
我要知道你們的談話內容
I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.

650
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,000
我會告訴他  他肯定很興奮
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

651
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,010
你聳什麼肩呢
What's that shrug for?

652
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,100
我和你說的是那個賣國賊
I'm talking to you about the traitor

653
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,860
他在伊斯坦布爾割了我們的人的喉嚨
who cut the throat of our man in Istanbul.

654
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:25,320
而這個該死的叛徒就是你組裡的人
I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section.

655
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,470
我還要指控你
I'm accusing you of

656
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:29,300
背著我和一個敵方間諜串通一氣
consorting with an enemy agent behind my back.

657
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,240
所以你竟敢還對著我聳肩
Don't damn well shrug at me!

658
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,900
你是不是想嘗嘗監獄的滋味
How would you like a term in prison?

659
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:49,290
好吧  我很久沒見到他了
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

660
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:53,110
所以你有什麼話就直說  別繞圈子了
So get your facts straight and get off my back!

661
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,620
那如果我告訴你  塔爾在最近去過巴黎
So... if I told you Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

662
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,870
你會感到意外嗎
would you be surprised?

663
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,730
不  裡基·塔爾幹出什麼事來我都不會意外
No, nothing would surprise me about Ricki Tarr.

664
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,490
那如果我告訴你  我們剛好知道
And if I told you we happen to know

665
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:06,230
上個月他的銀行賬戶
£30,000 mysteriously appeared...

666
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,300
有了一筆三萬英鎊的神秘錢款
in his bank account last month,

667
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,270
你會感到意外嗎
would that surprise you?

668
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,580
你的人是個叛徒  吉勒姆
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

669
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,390
幾個月前就叛變了
Turned by the opposition

670
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:22,830
而現在他們把他送了回來
months ago and now they've sent him back to us.

671
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,570
-為什麼  -別管什麼用處
- What for? - Never mind what for.

672
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:28,020
就是為了攪渾池水
To muddy the water, that's what for.

673
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:28,990
散佈謠言
To spread a whole lot of

674
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:32,150
讓我們自亂陣腳
damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

675
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,800
重點是
The point is this.

676
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,510
他正在回家路上
He's heading for home.

677
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:38,920
一看到他  你就立刻向我們幾個匯報
The first peep from him, you come to the grown-ups.

678
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,930
明白了嗎
Understood?

679
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,060
只有這間屋子裡的人  別的王八蛋可不行
Anyone you see around this table but not another damn soul.

680
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,070
出去
Get out.

681
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,310
彼得
Peter?

682
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,330
謝謝  布琳達
Thank you, Belinda.

683
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,080
老吳
Oh, Mr. Wu

684
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,800
哪裡是我的前途
What shall I do?

685
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,620
老吳
Oh, Mr. Wu

686
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,010
哪裡是我的前途
What shall I do?

687
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,650
老吳...
Mr. Wu...

688
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,140
一切都順利嗎
All go smoothly, did it?

689
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,430
我要回旅館找喬治
I need to go to the hotel to see George.

690
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:40,750
史邁利先生不在旅館  換地點了
Mr. Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue.

691
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,510
喬治
George?

692
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,830
吉勒姆先生
Mr. Guillam...

693
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,560
很抱歉過了這麼久才回來
Sorry it took me so long to come home.

694
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,490
裡基是來幫我們的  彼得
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

695
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,060
他把他的冒險故事都告訴我們了
He's been telling us all about his adventures.

696
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,670
他是個雙面間諜  喬治
He's a double, George.

697
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,900
沒什麼"地鼠"  都是莫斯科中心編造的
There is no mole. Whole thing's been thought up by Moscow.

698
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:33,340
卡拉給了他三萬英鎊
Karla bought him for £30,000.

699
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,580
因為你  我去了偷文件
I stole that because of you.

700
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,240
因為他  我還去監視自己人
I spied on my own because of him.

701
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,440
你知道我是什麼感受嗎
Do you know how that makes me feel?

702
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:41,620
裡基
Ricki...

703
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,010
你說你向圓場發過一封
you said you sent the Circus

704
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,260
關於伊琳娜的情報的電報
a telegram concerning Irina's information.

705
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,240
-是的  -那天是幾號
- That's right. - What was the date?

706
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,470
他不知道  因為根本沒有電報
He doesn't know because there was no telegram.

707
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:52,980
-整件事都是編造的  -11月20日
- The whole thing is a fabrication. - 20th November.

708
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:56,270
肯定是11月20日晚上
It must have been 20th November. Evening.

709
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,600
伊琳娜一直對我說  莫斯科中心
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre...

710
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,350
高層的每個人都要笑死你們了
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

711
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,510
她說卡拉...  
She told me Karla...

712
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:04,520
11月20日的記錄沒了
November 20th is missing.

713
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,580
有人在銷毀記錄  除非你認為
Someone is covering their tracks, unless of course you think

714
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,290
這只是個巧合
that's just a coincidence?

715
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,150
那錢是怎麼回事
What about the money?

716
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,010
卡拉要想保護"地鼠"  三萬塊錢不算什麼
30,000 isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his mole.

717
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:26,480
恐怕圓場有人知道了塔爾先生的事
I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mr. Tarr

718
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,840
並且想盡了一切辦法來詆毀他
and is doing everything they can to discredit him.

719
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,450
所有圓場以為是金子的情報  
Everything the Circus thinks is gold

720
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,540
都是莫斯科編出來的垃圾
is shit, made in Moscow.

721
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,710
你為什麼不告訴我塔爾的事
Why didn't you tell me that you had Tarr?

722
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,570
以防萬一我不能從圓場全身而退
In case I never made it out of the Circus.

723
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,500
我要休息一下
I should get some rest.

724
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,370
我想你得花時間研究資料了
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

725
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,340
上來聊聊吧 
Come up.

726
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,720
我見過他一次
I met him once.

727
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:16,330
卡拉
Karla.

728
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,380
那是1955年
In '55.

729
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,670
莫斯科中心四分五裂
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

730
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,370
一輪又一輪的大清洗
Purge after purge.

731
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,140
一半間諜紛紛叛離蘇聯
Half their agents were jumping ship.

732
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,990
我四處奔走  策反俄國人
I travelled around, signing them up.

733
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,910
有好幾百人
Hundreds of them.

734
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,380
有個人自稱格茨曼
One of them was calling himself Gerstmann.

735
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,830
當時他正要回俄羅斯
He was on his way back to Russia

736
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:52,900
而我們肯定他回去的結果就是被處死
and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed.

737
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:57,720
飛機在德裡停留24小時[印度城市]
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi and that's how long I had

738
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,940
我要在這段時間內說服他投靠我們
to convince him to come over to us

739
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,120
而不是回國送死
instead of going home to die.

740
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,220
那個房間很小
There's a little room.

741
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:17,030
我坐在這  他坐在那
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

742
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:25,260
美國人拷問過他
The Americans had him tortured.

743
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,660
他的指甲都沒了
He had no fingernails.

744
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,570
房間裡熱得要命
It's incredibly hot.

745
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,050
我當時精疲力竭
I'm very tired and all I want

746
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,760
只想快點了結此事回家
to do is get this over with and get back home.

747
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,110
我和安恩當時的情況不太好
Things weren't going well with Ann.

748
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,590
我說的都是平常那套
I give him the usual pitch.

749
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:00,880
投奔西方  我們能給你舒適的生活
Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life,

750
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,650
前提是你配合我們詢問
after questioning.

751
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,120
他說了什麼
What did he say?

752
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:16,660
想想你的妻子
Think of your wife.

753
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,330
你有妻子吧
You have a wife, don't you?

754
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,160
來  我帶了點香煙給你
Here. I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.

755
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,620
用我的打火機
Use my lighter.

756
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,820
我們可以安排她也過來
We could arrange for her to join you.

757
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:44,180
我們可以用人與她交換
We have a lot of stock to trade.

758
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,150
你回去被槍斃的話  她會被人排斥  
If you go back, she'll be ostracised.

759
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,340
想想她吧
Think of her.

760
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,290
想想看
Think about...

761
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:56,960
我一直
I kept on...

762
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:01,200
喋喋不休地說著他妻子
...harping on about the damn wife,

763
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,760
與其說是在說他  不如說是在說我自己
telling him more about me than...

764
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,210
當然  我應該站起來走人了
I should have walked out, of course.

765
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:14,670
但不知怎麼地
But for some reason it

766
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:17,850
我覺得必須要留住他  所以我繼續說
seemed important to save this one, so I go on.

767
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,340
我們其實沒什麼不同
We're not so very different you and I.

768
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,990
咱們這一輩子
We've both spent our lives

769
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:30,620
都想在對方的制度上找弱點
looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems.

770
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,780
難道你現在還沒有認識到
Don't you think it's time to recognise

771
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,770
你自己的一方與我這邊一樣  
there is as little worth

772
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:40,610
沒有什麼值得拚命的東西嗎
on your side as there is on mine?

773
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,020
他什麼都沒說
Never said a word.

774
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,600
一句話也沒說
Not one word.

775
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,050
第二天早上他上了飛機
And the next morning he got back on his plane.

776
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:20,660
他把那盒香煙原封不動地還給了我
He handed the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched.

777
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:23,610
而他可是個老煙鬼
This was a chain-smoker, mind.

778
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,070
然後他飛回了俄國  明知道是回去送死
And he flew off to what he presumed would be his death.

779
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,390
他留著我的打火機
He kept my lighter.

780
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:39,750
那是份禮物
It was a gift.

781
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:44,220
喬治留念
"To George from Ann.

782
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,440
愛你的安恩贈
All my love.

783
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,470
他就是卡拉
That was Karla.

784
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,440
他寧可死  也不願投靠我們
He went back to die rather than giving in.

785
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,510
所以我知道他也不是刀槍不入
Yes, and that's how I know he can be beaten.

786
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,210
因為他是個狂熱分子
Because he's a fanatic.

787
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:16,060
而狂熱分子總是懷有疑心
And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.

788
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:22,970
他長什麼樣
What did he look like?

789
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:27,030
我不記得了
I can't remember.

790
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,960
今天之後  彼得
After today, Peter,

791
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,940
你必須假設自己被監視了
you have to assume they're watching you.

792
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:03,460
如果你有什麼事情要收拾
If there's anything you need tidied up,

793
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:08,880
趕緊收拾掉吧
now is the time.

794
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,910
快弄完了
Nearly done.

795
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,310
老天爺
For God's sake.

796
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,630
有時候我覺得他們簡直都一樣蠢
Sometimes I think they're all sharing the same moronic brain.

797
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,950
如果你愛上了其他人  直說好了
If there's someone else, you can tell me.

798
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,160
我是個成年人了
I'm a grown-up.

799
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:32,990
我知道  這個聖誕節會很棒
I know. It's just going to be such a wonderful Christmas.

800
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,050
失陪一下
Excuse me.

801
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:48,020
我太驕傲  不肯屈服
And I was too proud to give in.

802
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:58,570
而困難是不得不過得坎
I had to learn the hard way.

803
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,860
-驕傲...  -彼得  準備好了嗎
- That pride...  - Peter, when you're ready,

804
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,470
開始吧
put it on now.

805
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,410
大家一起來
Everybody!

806
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,190
-傑裡  -喬治
- Jerry. - George.

807
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,680
-彼得  -傑裡
- Peter. - Jerry.

808
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,080
我要和你談談
I need to talk to you.

809
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,560
關於吉姆·普萊多被殺那晚
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.

810
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,360
當天你是值星官吧
You were duty officer, weren't you?

811
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:44,630
是的  那天晚上老總讓我留下來收電報
Yeah. Control asked me to man the phones that night.

812
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,720
他說有人在執行特殊任務
He said someone was doing a special job for the service.

813
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:50,090
他需要可靠的人在總機房值班
He wanted someone he could trust.

814
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:28,970
出事了  引起了一點恐慌  先生
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

815
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:33,410
這是從外交部發來的電報
This is from the FO resident clerk.

816
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,130
一條匈牙利新聞
A Hungarian news bulletin.

817
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,680
一個化名埃利斯的英國間諜
British spy, work name Ellis,

818
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,980
使用偽造的匈牙利證件
travelling with false Hungarian papers,

819
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,530
試圖在布達佩斯綁架一名
has attempted to kidnap

820
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,910
沒有透露姓名的匈牙利將軍
an unnamed Hungarian General in Budapest.

821
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:47,980
他被槍擊了
He's been shot.

822
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,810
現在正在追捕同謀犯
Other arrests imminent.

823
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,100
可以跟我講個大概嗎
Can I have a brief, please?

824
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:02,340
你要我否認嗎  先生
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

825
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,520
我一定得知道大概情況  先生
I must have a brief, sir.

826
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,580
老總一句話也沒說
I couldn't get a word out of Control.

827
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,040
所以我啟動了應急預案
So I followed protocol and went for the emergency list.

828
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,890
你打電話到我家
You rang my house.

829
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,480
萬一你提早從柏林回來了
Just on the off-chance you were back from Berlin.

830
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,290
你說了什麼
What did you say?

831
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,840
-你好  -你好  史邁利夫人
- 'Hello?' - Hello, Mrs. Smiley.

832
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,320
我是圓場辦公室的傑裡·威斯特貝
It's Jerry. Jerry Westerby from the office.

833
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,290
發生了危機事件
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

834
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,570
安恩說你還沒回來  沒別的了
Ann said you wasn't back yet and that was it.

835
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:37,800
繼續
Go on.

836
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:39,700
一切都亂了套
All hell broke loose.

837
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,150
軍方嚷嚷匈牙利坦克在邊境調動
Military yelling about Hungarian tanks on the border.

838
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:45,220
拉康和大臣也都來電嚷個不停
Lacon and the minister baying at the door.

839
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:48,390
感謝上帝  比爾·海頓出現了
Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

840
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,130
-海頓先生  -別煩我
- Mr. Haydon. - Not now.

841
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:50,860
海頓先生
Mr. Haydon!

842
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,860
都給我出去
Out!

843
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,150
-說吧  -我試圖聯繫你
- Tell me. - I tried to get hold of you.

844
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:01,040
我在俱樂部的自動收報機上看到了  怎麼回事
I got half a story on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.

845
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,860
吉姆·普萊多中了槍
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

846
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,140
給我接匈牙利大使館
Get me the Hungarian embassy.

847
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,700
告訴你主子  如果他們傷了吉姆一根寒毛
You tell your masters what will happen

848
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,740
我就要他們好看
if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged.

849
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,790
打電話給伊斯特哈斯
Get Esterhase on the phone.

850
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,300
讓他召集所有匈牙利間諜
Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

851
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,720
是  先生
Yes, sir.

852
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:33,430
有他的消息嗎  先生
Any more news on him? Sir?

853
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:39,190
天哪
Oh, God.

854
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:42,870
我們得檢查他的公寓  清理掉所有相關的東西
We need to get down to his flat, clear out anything linked.

855
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,620
海頓是在俱樂部裡看到消息的嗎
Haydon heard the news at his club?

856
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,030
沙維爾俱樂部
The Savile.

857
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:31,690
凌晨一點半  這麼晚自動收報機還開著嗎
1:30? The ticker-tape wouldn't have been running.

858
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,490
那他怎麼會知道
So how did he know?

859
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:37,300
-上帝啊  喬治  -彼得
- Jesus, George. - Peter!

860
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,460
老天爺  比爾·海頓
Jesus Christ, Bill Haydon.

861
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,030
-他怎麼會知道  -不是你想的那樣
- How could he have known? - It's not what you think.

862
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:43,580
-那他怎麼會知道  -因為他當天晚上在我家
- Then how did he know? - He was at my house that night.

863
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,300
旅途愉快嗎
Good flight?

864
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:19,800
是的
Yes.

865
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,130
非常愉快
Pleasant enough.

866
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,890
我正好路過  就來打個招呼  
I was just passing. I thought I'd call in.

867
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,050
安恩還在床上  但她堅持要起來
Ann was in bed. She insisted on getting up.

868
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:30,670
她說她馬上就下來
She said she'd be down in a minute.

869
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:36,530
這是我拿下來的  畫得真差
That's what I'm dropping off. It's an awful daub really.

870
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,290
但是安恩很喜歡
But Ann expressed a liking.

871
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,680
她怎麼還不下來
What's keeping her?

872
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:03,290
繼續
Keep going.

873
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,740
跟上  小伙子們  快跑
Come on, lads. Keep up.

874
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:10,990
加油  比爾
Come on, Bill!

875
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,090
-戴了眼鏡嗎  大胖  -戴了  先生
- Got your specs on, Jumbo? - Yes, sir.

876
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:28,380
過來
Come here.

877
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,280
你看看他是什麼人
Who's that fellow down there?

878
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,710
我不知道  先生
I don't know, sir.

879
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:42,770
他是誰
Who is he?

880
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:44,970
乞丐嗎
Beggar man?

881
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:47,230
小偷嗎
Thief?

882
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,670
為什麼他不朝我們這邊看
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

883
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:52,740
如果你看到一群孩子
Wouldn't you if you saw a

884
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,780
在操場上開著車跑  你不會朝這邊看嗎
bunch of boys flogging a car round a field?

885
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,690
他是怎麼回事  他不喜歡我們嗎
What's the matter with him? Doesn't he like us?

886
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,470
我不能讓這樣一個怪人在附近溜躂
I don't hold with odd-bods hanging around.

887
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,840
他可能會偷走那輛阿爾維斯轎車
He might steal the Alvis.

888
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,710
-而那是  -英國最好的車  先生
- Which is? - The best car in England, sir.

889
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,140
好孩子
Good lad.

890
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,630
關於布達佩斯的任務  他對你交代了什麼
How were you briefed for the Budapest mission?

891
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,550
老總讓我去了肯辛頓的一所公寓
Control asked me to come to a flat in Kensington.

892
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,770
有個爛蘋果  吉姆
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

893
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:39,210
我們得把他揪出來
And we have to find it.

894
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,360
你怎麼看  吉姆
What did you make of it, Jim?

895
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:46,570
對於老總的這個想法
Control's theory?

896
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:49,790
完全是胡說八道
I thought it was madness.

897
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,650
我知道是高層的五個人之一
I know that it is one of five men.

898
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:01,050
你只需要記住一個代號
All I want from you is one code name.

899
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,220
阿勒萊恩
Alleline.

900
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:12,710
鍋匠
Tinker.

901
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:14,850
海頓
Haydon.

902
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,230
裁縫
Tailor.

903
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,580
布蘭德
Bland.

904
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:25,380
士兵
Soldier.

905
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:27,830
鍋匠，裁縫，士兵，水手，富人，窮人，乞丐，小偷

906
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:30,350
我們不用水手  和裁縫發音太近
We drop Sailor. It's too close to Tailor.

907
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:34,260
兒童在數櫻桃核兒  坎肩紐扣  雛菊花瓣  梯牧草籽時唱的算命歌謠

908
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:32,940
而富人也不合適
And Rich Man doesn't seem to be applicable.

909
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:35,790
伊斯特哈斯
Esterhase.

910
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,380
窮人
Poor Man.

911
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,750
那第五個人呢
And the fifth?

912
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,550
史邁利
Smiley.

913
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,110
我覺得這太瘋狂了
I thought it was madness.

914
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:00,540
認為你們中間有一個是叛徒
To think that any one of you could have been a traitor.

915
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,360
這簡直是瘋了
Absolute madness.

916
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:08,630
但你還是去了
But you still went.

917
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:10,620
為什麼
Why?

918
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,850
因為老總讓我去
I went because Control asked me to go.

919
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,120
那是我的職責
It's called doing one's duty.

920
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,320
我在車站和跑腿的人接頭
At the station I met the legman

921
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,920
由他帶我去見將軍
supposed to take me to the General.

922
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,600
那個服務員一定是慌了神
The waiter must have panicked.

923
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,960
這本來是次很簡單的抓捕任務
It was meant to be a simple snatch job.

924
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,820
他們把我送去了一家軍事醫院
They drove me to some military hospital,

925
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:49,240
然後又用飛機把我轉移了
and then put me on a transport plane.

926
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,630
從窗外的星星判斷  飛機是在朝東飛
I could tell by the stars we were heading east.

927
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,680
之後他們開始審訊我
Then they worked me for...

928
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:02,620
也不知道審訊了多久
I don't know how long.

929
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:07,010
幾周  也可能有幾個月
Weeks, maybe months.

930
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:48,240
你招了些什麼
What did you tell them?

931
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:50,930
全招了
Everything.

932
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,600
我盡全力堅持了一陣
I held on for as long as I could

933
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,020
好讓其他人能及時脫身
to let everyone get the hell out of there.

934
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,030
他們脫身了嗎
Did they?

935
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,950
我在匈牙利的諜報網
My networks in Hungary,

936
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:04,960
他們都逃出去了嗎
did they get out?

937
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:09,930
沒有  他們都被破獲了
No, they were blown.

938
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:16,140
官方說是你為了活命而出賣了他們
The story is you blew them to save your own skin.

939
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:25,780
審訊官離開之後
After the interrogators had cleared out,

940
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,930
進來了個小個子
this little fellow turned up.

941
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,070
看著像是個神父
Looked like a priest.

942
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:36,520
真正的審訊才剛剛開始
That's when they really started on me.

943
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,480
你的底線是什麼
What was your last line of defence?

944
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:42,850
那個地鼠
The mole.

945
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:47,020
老總瘋狂的想法
Control's crazy theory.

946
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,480
我決定對此事守口如瓶
I was going to bury that so deep

947
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,760
絕不讓他們問出來
they'd never get it out of me.

948
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:57,840
-現在看來太可笑了  -為什麼
- Which was a joke. - Why?

949
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:00,640
因為他們已經知道了
Because they already knew.

950
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,900
而他們只想知道
All they wanted to know was

951
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:05,460
老總查到什麼地步了
how far Control had got in his investigation.

952
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,920
你認識這個女人嗎

953
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:22,340
不  我不認識她
No, I don't know her.

954
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:31,390
告訴阿勒萊恩我們做了什麼

955
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:45,570
他們有沒有問起我
Did they ask about me at all?

956
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,420
問了
Yes.

957
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:50,360
那個小個子問起了你
The little fellow did.

958
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,960
他怎麼說的我
What did he say about me?

959
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,470
他有個打火機
He had this cigarette lighter.

960
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,760
他在我面前不時地打著火
He kept flashing it about for me to see it.

961
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:06,940
還把上面的刻字給我看
Showed me the inscription.

962
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,560
喬治留念  愛你的
To George From Ann.

963
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,530
安恩贈
"All my love".

964
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:20,060
他就是卡拉
Karla.

965
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:52,400
奇怪的是
It was odd.

966
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:56,490
他們把我送回了英格蘭
They sent me back to England.

967
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:59,840
直接到沙拉特匯報情況
Straight to Sarratt for debriefing'.

968
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:05,880
他說他在病房裡匯報情況的時候
He said when he was being debriefed at the nursery,

969
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,430
有人去看過他
he had a visitor.

970
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,170
誰
Who?

971
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,610
托比·伊斯特哈斯
Toby Esterhase.

972
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:15,360
給了他一千鎊和一輛阿爾維斯
He gave him 1,000 pound and an Alvis.

973
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,830
告訴他  他已經死了
Told him he was dead now.

974
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:19,080
不能再回去了
Couldn't come back.

975
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,390
只能忘掉過去
Had to become a lotus eater,

976
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:23,150
忘掉所有發生過的事
forget everything that happened.

977
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:24,770
還說了老總的想法
Control's theory.

978
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,550
鍋匠和裁縫什麼的全說了
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.

979
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:30,680
是的  我也這麼想
Yes, that's what I thought.

980
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:36,200
伊斯特哈斯怎麼會知道代號的事
How on earth did Esterhase hear about Tinker, Tailor?

981
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,780
伊琳娜一直對我說  莫斯科中心
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

982
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:57,580
高層的每個人都要笑死你們了
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

983
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,320
她說卡拉為此很得意
She told me Karla was very proud of this.

984
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,670
她說所有圓場以為是金子的情報
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold

985
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:04,370
都是莫斯科編出來的垃圾
is shit, made in Moscow.

986
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,010
伊琳娜一直對我說  莫斯科中心
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

987
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:14,960
高層的每個人都要笑死你們了
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

988
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,720
不  我住在附近的旅館
No, I had a hotel nearby.

989
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:18,730
那裡的房價很便宜
They do have some seedy rooms.

990
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,560
伊琳娜一直對我說  莫斯科中心
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

991
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,140
高層的每個人都要笑死你們了
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

992
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,860
她說卡拉為此很得意
She told me Karla was very proud of this.

993
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:05,230
她說所有圓場以為是金子的情報都是垃圾
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit.

994
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,250
這次會面從沒發生過  明白了嗎
This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear?

995
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:41,260
是的  大臣
Perfectly, Minister.

996
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:51,210
在城裡某處有所房子
There is a house somewhere in this city

997
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,290
那裡是阿勒萊恩和其他人
where Alleline and the others

998
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:56,760
與巫師駐倫敦代表接頭的地方
meet Witchcraft's London representative.

999
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,790
我以為拉康和你說清楚了
I thought Lacon had made it clear to you.

1000
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:01,850
別參合巫師的事
Keep your nose bloody well out of Witchcraft's business.

1001
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:04,230
我就是在按拉康的意思辦
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

1002
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:07,010
是你讓我追隨老總的腳步
You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.

1003
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:09,520
我覺得那不是什麼好主意
I wouldn't consider that sound advice,

1004
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,040
瞧瞧老總給我們留下的爛攤子
given the mess Control left us with.

1005
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:16,610
不是我搶功  阿勒萊恩和我
It has taken Alleline and, if I may say so, myself

1006
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,490
花了很長時間才讓一切重回正軌
this long to get us back in the game.

1007
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:24,340
與阿勒萊恩及其他人接頭的人叫波裡雅科夫
The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov.

1008
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,220
你們認為他的任務
You believe his role is to bring information

1009
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,420
是替巫師傳遞情報
from Witchcraft to you.

1010
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:36,510
他真正的任務是將從地鼠這邊獲得的情報
His real role is to receive information from the mole

1011
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:38,280
傳回給卡拉
to take back to Karla.

1012
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:43,140
這不可能
That, er... That's not possible.

1013
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:44,780
變成可能了
Made possible.

1014
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,830
就在那幢你讓財政部出錢的房子裡
By you in the house you persuaded the Treasury to pay for.

1015
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:54,940
巫師的情報是真實的  那是金子
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine. It's been gold.

1016
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:58,790
最多就比銅板兒亮一些
It's just enough glitter amongst the chicken feed.

1017
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:02,320
老總不相信奇跡和巫師
Control didn't believe in miracles or in Witchcraft.

1018
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,900
但是你們懶惰而貪婪
But you were lazy and greedy

1019
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:05,770
所以你們把他排擠出了圓場
and so you hounded him out of the Circus

1020
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:08,560
卻引來了卡拉
and you let Karla in.

1021
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,460
你還開通了談判渠道
You opened negotiations

1022
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,330
與美國佬交換起了情報
to exchange intelligence with the Americans.

1023
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:17,910
美國人對圓場說了什麼  克里姆林宮也一清二楚
What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin.

1024
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:23,540
巫師的情報  就是卡拉給你們的金子
Witchcraft's information, the "Gold" Karla let you have,

1025
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,160
不是為了引誘你們
it wasn't to lure you.

1026
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,470
而是為了引誘美國人
It was to lure the Americans.

1027
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:32,170
事到如今
Now,

1028
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:35,540
你們還把他當成生金蛋的鵝嗎
do you want to take credit for that?

1029
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,960
那我們怎麼辦
What can we do?

1030
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:47,650
我們有那個地鼠想要的東西
We have one thing the mole wants.

1031
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,800
-如果我去巴黎  -你一定要去
- If I go to Paris - You'll go.

1032
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,620
我是說如果我去
If I go to Paris,

1033
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:59,930
你得保證把伊琳娜救回來
I want your word that you will get Irina back.

1034
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,940
隨便你拿誰去交換
I don't care who you have to trade.

1035
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:04,830
完事後我就退出
And I am out.

1036
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,800
我想要個家庭
I want a family, thank you.

1037
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,590
我不想落得你們這種下場
I do not want to end up like you lot.

1038
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:14,510
你必須把她救出來
You will get her back.

1039
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,000
裡基  我會盡力
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

1040
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,870
你好  喬治
Oh, hello, George.

1041
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:48,450
你好
Hello.

1042
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:17,440
托比  我們來聊聊忠誠吧
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

1043
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:22,520
是老總招募了你  對吧
Control recruited you, didn't he?

1044
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:26,140
當時你還在維也納的一個博物館裡挨餓
Found you starving in a museum in Vienna.

1045
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:28,030
還被人通緝
A wanted man.

1046
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:31,340
我聽說是他救了你
Saved your life, I heard.

1047
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:34,570
但到了關鍵的時候
And yet when the time came,

1048
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:37,100
當你要在他和阿勒萊恩之間選擇時
when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline,

1049
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,790
你眼睛都不眨一下
you didn't hesitate.

1050
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:41,610
或許對你這種有戰爭經驗的人
That's understandable, perhaps,

1051
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,630
這並不難理解
with your war experience.

1052
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:45,800
我認為  你能混到今天
You survived this long, I suppose,

1053
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:48,680
完全是靠你兩邊倒的功力
because of your ability to change sides.

1054
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:50,940
所謂有奶便是娘
Serve any master.

1055
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:59,750
喬治  你這是幹什麼啊
What? What's... What's this about, George?

1056
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:04,040
我要弄清楚你到底在為誰賣命  托比
It's about which master you've been serving, Toby.

1057
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:10,280
有人在洩露情報  托比
Intelligence has been leaked, Toby.

1058
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,480
有人一直從圓場竊取資料
Someone's been taking files from the Circus.

1059
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,260
不不不
No, no, no, no. No.

1060
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:17,610
你搞錯了  這是個誤會
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.

1061
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:21,250
是不是有人把資料送去給俄使館參事
Files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?

1062
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:23,110
是的
Yes.

1063
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,210
是的  我送過
And, yes, I delivered them.

1064
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:35,030
但潘西·阿勒萊恩也送過
But so did Percy Alleline.

1065
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,030
乖孩子
Good boy.

1066
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,260
比爾·海頓
Bill Haydon.

1067
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,290
還有羅埃·布蘭德
And so did Roy Bland.

1068
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:59,310
喬治  事情不總是表面看上去的那樣
Things aren't always what they seem, George.

1069
01:41:59,310 --> 01:42:01,210
這你也該知道
You should know that.

1070
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:04,510
聽著  莫斯科那邊認為波裡雅科夫
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...

1071
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,550
是為他們賣命
...working for them.

1072
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:12,950
我們時不時會給他些文件發回中心
Every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them.

1073
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:15,550
都是些不值錢的情報  就為取悅他的主子
Chicken feed, just to keep his bosses happy.

1074
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:20,870
但波裡雅科夫是我們的人
But Polyakov's our Joe.

1075
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:22,980
他是某個重大行動的一份子
He's a part of a big operation.

1076
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:25,330
巫術行動
Operation Witchcraft.

1077
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:27,300
是的  我知道
Yes, I know.

1078
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:29,470
喬治
George.

1079
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,570
-求你了  別這麼對我  -是誰讓你
- Please, I don't deserve this. - Who gave you the message

1080
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:35,850
去警告吉姆·普萊多忘記代號的事
for Jim Prideaux to forget about Tinker, Tailor?

1081
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:38,330
-布蘭德  -那是誰讓你排擠了康妮·沙赫斯
- Bland. - To get rid of Connie Sachs?

1082
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:40,340
-和威斯特貝  -布蘭德
- Westerby? - Bland.

1083
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:41,840
還是海頓
Or Haydon.

1084
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:44,690
我不記得了  他們中的一個
I don't know. One of them.

1085
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:47,500
也可能是潘西  不
Or maybe Percy. No.

1086
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:49,450
我記不得是誰了
Well, I don't know who.

1087
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,030
你就是個跑腿的
You're just the messenger.

1088
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:55,660
在他們中間來回奔波
Running between them all.

1089
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,350
和巫師有關的事你都肯做
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

1090
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:03,030
我對你們的情報來源瞭如指掌
I know all about your secret source.

1091
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:06,580
我還知道你們不知道的內幕
And I know something you don't.

1092
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,180
我知道那個人是誰
I know who he is.

1093
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:14,550
他是卡拉
He's Karla.

1094
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:27,160
你們中有人把絕密情報給了波裡雅科夫
One of you has been giving Polyakov the crown jewels.

1095
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:30,510
-我不知道  -托比  你在那邊還是通緝犯嗎
- I did not know. - Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

1096
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:32,640
聽著  喬治  我真不知道
Look, George, I didn't know.

1097
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:35,010
你站錯了隊伍
You picked the wrong side.

1098
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:36,590
不  你必須相信我
No, you've got to believe me.

1099
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:39,070
求你了  喬治
George, please.

1100
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,240
我是忠心的
I am loyal.

1101
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:48,970
我是忠心的
I... I am loyal.

1102
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,760
別把我遣送回去
Don't... Don't... Don't send me back.

1103
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:04,270
求你了  喬治
Please, George.

1104
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:06,800
別把我送回去
Don't send me back.

1105
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,050
把地址告訴我
Give me the address.

1106
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,490
你們在哪裡和波裡雅科夫接頭
Where do you meet Polyakov?

1107
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:36,270
狗狗安靜點
Hey, hey! Dog, dog, be quiet!

1108
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:39,570
怎麼了  你們是誰
What is this? Who are you?

1109
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:41,860
-你是麥克雷格夫人嗎  -是的
- Mrs. McCraig? - Yes.

1110
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:59,820
-安全暗號是什麼  -通風口
- What are the safety signals? - The air vent.

1111
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:00,870
如果開著就沒問題
Open and all's well,

1112
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:02,660
關著就是不要入內
closed and you're not to enter.

1113
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:07,150
話筒在哪裡
And the microphone?

1114
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,150
彼得
Peter?

1115
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:39,220
選自菲利希亞·赫曼斯的詩歌  卡薩布蘭卡

1116
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,580
男孩站在燃燒的甲板上
The boy stood on the burning deck

1117
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:36,090
眾人皆已逃離
whence all but he had fled

1118
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:37,410
火焰吞噬了殘骸
The flame that lit the battle's wreck

1119
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:39,220
照亮了陣亡的士兵
shone brightly o'er the dead.

1120
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:41,220
他挺拔自豪地站立著
Beautiful and proud he stood

1121
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,990
好似生來就能操控風浪
as born to rule the storm

1122
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:44,440
英雄的血肉之軀
A creature of heroic blood,

1123
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:46,710
化身在一名孩童的身上
a proud though child-like form.

1124
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:47,380
這火焰翻滾著...
The flames rolled on...

1125
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:49,450
而沒有父親的命令  他始終堅守...
he would not go. Without his father's word

1126
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,170
謝謝  再見
Merci. Au revoir.

1127
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,380
去啊
Go on.

1128
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:48,350
裡基  整個情報機構都在找你
The whole service is looking for you, Ricki.

1129
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:49,930
他們逮到你後肯定把你剝皮拆骨了
They'll skin you alive if they find you.

1130
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:51,500
說不定我就要他們找到我呢
Maybe I want them to find me.

1131
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:54,280
你可以走了
You can go now.

1132
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,370
把密碼本留下
Leave the books where they are

1133
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:56,600
鑰匙插在機器上
and put the keys in the machines.

1134
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,130
不行  班留在這裡
No, Ben stays here.

1135
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,100
裡基·塔爾自稱掌握
Ricki Tarr claims to have

1136
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:04,720
對保障圓場至關緊要的情報
information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

1137
01:47:26,910 --> 01:47:28,230
史邁利先生
Mr. Smiley?

1138
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,470
有出租車往圓場去了
Taxi approaching Circus.

1139
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:46,200
是鍋匠
Tinker.

1140
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:58,980
裁縫
Tailor.

1141
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:06,090
士兵也來了
Here comes Soldier.

1142
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:12,410
人全齊了
Full house.

1143
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,760
好了  大聲念
Well, go on then. Read it out loud.

1144
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:31,800
阿勒萊恩發給塔爾的私人電報
Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

1145
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:37,550
要求你澄清後才能答應你的要求
Require clarification before meeting your request.

1146
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:40,370
"對保障圓場
Quote, information vital

1147
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:44,300
至關緊要的情報"
to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote.

1148
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:49,820
此話不合要求  必須提供進一步情報
Does not qualify, send further information.

1149
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:52,590
就是這樣  潘西那小子  你就拖著吧
Ah! That's it, Percy, you keep stalling.

1150
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,430
我警告你  班
I warn you, Ben.

1151
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,510
咱們這個單位裡儘是渾蛋
We've got some really lousy people in this outfit.

1152
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:57,670
要是我就他媽的一個都不信他們
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

1153
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,160
他們開完會了
The meeting's over.

1154
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:11,810
他們準備走了
They're leaving.

1155
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:38,590
要是我們被打斷了  有什麼借口

1156
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:47,180
好  開關關掉了嗎  你去看一下好嗎

1157
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:56,990
確保你也參與了會面的安排

1158
01:50:56,990 --> 01:51:00,220
不等塔爾走到十英里以內

1159
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:03,640
我們就能把他攔下來  除掉他

1160
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:27,990
我是外交使團成員

1161
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:33,960
讓你們的手下過來時  他們最好記住這點

1162
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:36,470
你為什麼不高興

1163
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:40,110
沒準莫斯科會賞你一枚獎章和一套公寓

1164
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:44,190
我才是那個被派去西伯利亞的可憐蟲

1165
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:16,070
克拉多斯說幾天後我就能回蘇聯了
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

1166
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,980
我一直在想
I keep thinking how much

1167
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:21,100
自己有多懷念莫斯科的板球
I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.

1168
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:29,000
我希望
I was rather hoping you

1169
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,870
你能替我安排些瑣事
might do a little light housekeeping for me.

1170
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,780
我盡力
If I can.

1171
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:38,130
有這麼個女孩
There's a girl.

1172
01:53:39,290 --> 01:53:40,900
給她些錢  好嗎
Give her some money, would you?

1173
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:43,780
再給她編個好點的掩飾故事
And give her a good cover story.

1174
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,050
可以的話  告訴她我愛她
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1175
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:50,090
錢都在那裡
It's all there.

1176
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:52,560
還有個小伙子
And there's a boy, too.

1177
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:54,610
給他些錢讓他別亂說話
Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1178
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:59,260
那些審訊伎倆我都知道
I know the inquisitors' bag of tricks.

1179
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,870
大部分都是我教的
I taught most of them.

1180
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:05,300
就是看對方的反應
It's just a reaction.

1181
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,860
或者說是過激的反應
An over-reaction, if you like.

1182
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:13,530
我倒是有一兩個問題要問你
I did have one or two questions.

1183
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:18,610
-關於普萊多  -他媽的
- About Prideaux. - Goddamn it!

1184
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:21,800
-我不是把他弄回來了嗎  -是啊
- I got him back, didn't I? - Yes, yes, you did.

1185
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,620
這是你夠朋友的地方
That was good of you.

1186
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:28,230
我很意外卡拉沒有把他槍斃了事
I am surprised Karla didn't have him shot.

1187
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:31,780
還是因為你的緣故
Or do you think he held back,

1188
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,050
他才手下留情
out of delicacy towards you?

1189
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:40,570
去匈牙利執行任務之前
Did Prideaux come and see you

1190
01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:43,320
普萊多有來看過你嗎
before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1191
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:48,360
是的  他來過
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1192
01:54:51,390 --> 01:54:52,760
來說什麼
To say what?

1193
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,440
他是來警告你
To warn you.

1194
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,580
因為他內心深處知道
Because he knew deep down

1195
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:08,170
你就是那個地鼠
it was you all along.

1196
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:14,230
你也知道
So did you.

1197
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:21,650
喬治  我必須選擇一邊
I had to pick a side, George.

1198
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:26,090
這可以說是美學上的考慮  當然也有道義上
It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one.

1199
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:31,200
西方社會變得醜陋不堪
And the West has become so very ugly.

1200
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,330
你不覺得嗎
Don't you think?

1201
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:38,750
卡拉考慮過讓你接管圓場嗎
Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?

1202
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,280
我不是他該死的勤雜工
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1203
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,470
那你算什麼  比爾
What are you, then, Bill?

1204
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,940
我是個下定決心的人
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1205
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:09,020
你有什麼特別的話
Is there anything particular

1206
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:11,330
要我轉告安恩的嗎
you want me to pass on to Ann?

1207
01:56:15,310 --> 01:56:16,800
喬治  我和她的事並不是針對你
Oh, that was nothing personal, George.

1208
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:18,450
希望你能理解
I hope you understand that.

1209
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:21,810
卡拉說你很了不起
Karla said you were good,

1210
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:24,020
你是我們最大的威脅
the one we had to worry about.

1211
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:27,600
但是你有一個把柄
But you do have a blind spot.

1212
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,920
他認為如果大家都知道我是安恩的情人
He reckoned if I was known to be Ann's lover,

1213
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,410
你在別的事情上也就無法保持頭腦清醒了
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

1214
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:38,920
他是對的
And he was right.

1215
01:56:41,030 --> 01:56:42,320
在一定程度上
Up to a point.

1216
01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:47,780
一定程度上
Up to a point.

1217
01:57:15,490 --> 01:57:17,230
這是我給你做的  先生
I made this for you, sir.

1218
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:28,560
以後你別再來這裡了
I don't want you hanging around here any more.

1219
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:32,930
從今天開始離我遠點
Keep away from me from now on.

1220
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:37,680
-去和大家一起玩  -但是
- Go and join the others. - But...

1221
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:40,840
努力加入他們  好嗎
Just... just bloody join in, will you?

1222
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:46,780
快去玩啊  渾小子
Go and play, damn you!

1223
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:06,450
你能去檢查下嗎  傑裡
Could you check, Jerry?

1224
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:32,740
