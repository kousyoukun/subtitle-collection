1
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,065
You weren't followed?

2
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,447
No.

3
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,407
Better come in.

4
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,619
Trust no one, Jim.

5
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,787
Especially not in the mainstream.

6
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,753
Sit down.

7
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,266
I understand you still have
one H ungarian identity running?

8
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,815
I do.

9
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,323
I want you to go to Budapest.

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,412
'This is not above board.

11
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,626
'Nobody else knows.

12
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,672
'They're after my head, Jim boy.

13
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,088
'Do you understand?

14
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,823
'I have had an offer of service.

15
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,495
'A Hungarian general
wants to come over.

16
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,953
'I would lik e you to meet him.'

17
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,339
He has some information
that I need, J im.

18
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,506
What information?

19
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,967
Treasure.

20
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,685
'He has the name of the mole

21
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,481
'the Russians have planted
in the British intelligence service

22
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,525
'right at the top of the Circus.

23
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,243
'There's a rotten apple, Jim.

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,536
'We have to find it.'

25
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,812
Stop!

26
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,642
Would you witness this for me?

27
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,436
I wish I could done more, Control.

28
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,151
You did all you could, Percy.

29
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,986
Well, a man should know
when to leave the party.

30
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,328
What about Smiley?

31
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,623
Smiley is leaving with me.

32
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,233
You little prick, Esterhase.

33
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,161
Gentlemen, shall we start?

34
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,054
U nder Secretary Lacon
is ready for you, Sir Percy.

35
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,602
The Treasury don't understand.

36
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,946
Why can't the intelligence service
simply put in a request

37
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,656
for a general increase in funding

38
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,697
and then you account
for the spend on your special operation?

39
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,576
Operation Witchcraft
needs to remain secret.

40
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,667
- It's a fiefdom of its own.
- Yes, that's what's worrying us.

41
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,411
The whole thing's
very unaccountable, isn't it?

42
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,754
And this London house
that nobody knows the address of,

43
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,501
is that really necessary?

44
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,005
Now more than ever.
We need to protect our Soviet source.

45
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,851
So where do you propose we meet?
In a café?

46
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,686
The rent and rates on this house
have doubled.

47
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,895
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

48
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,895
We're asking
for a few thousand for a house.

49
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,022
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

50
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,864
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

51
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,529
Look, nobody underestimates

52
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,277
the importance of the job
you chaps are doing.

53
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,700
But what happened
in Budapest last year,

54
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,583
that was a disaster.

55
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,623
With respect, sir,

56
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,793
it wasn't one of your civil servants
that got killed, was it?

57
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,337
Now this isn't about soldiers
in trenches any more.

58
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,711
- We're the front line now...
- Roy!

59
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,260
For 25 years we've been the only thing
standing between them and Karla

60
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,633
and Moscow
and the third bloody world war.

61
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,938
Look, the Minister's very pleased
with your progress so far.

62
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,733
He's less pleased, though,

63
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,478
with the lack of progress
with our American cousins.

64
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,568
You see,

65
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,737
in their eyes,

66
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,361
you're still a leaky ship.

67
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,554
Yes?

68
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,720
'Someone on the line for you, sir.
Seems urgent. '

69
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,593
All right, well put him through.

70
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,766
- Hello?
- 'Ls this U nder Secretary Lacon? '

71
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,267
Yes.

72
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,611
My name's Ricki Tarr.

73
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,068
- 'What do you want? '
- I need to meet you.

74
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,740
If you need to confirm who I am,
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

75
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,612
Peter Guillam.

76
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,411
But only Guillam, no one else.

77
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,514
You got clearance for that?

78
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,510
Well, I'm not bloody
chaining it up outside.

79
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,308
Mind you, no better off in here
with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

80
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,978
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

81
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,648
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse
of the new girl before Bland gets to her.

82
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,113
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

83
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,324
- Has he seen her yet?
- Of course he has.

84
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,114
Came down first thing this morning.

85
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,952
Belinda.

86
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,007
- Peter Guillam.
- 'Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

87
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,718
'Just ringing to find out...

88
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,339
'So Winston
Churchill saved your life, Edie.'

89
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,058
'I was working in the kitchen,
getting dinner ready.

90
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,927
'And he was late, you see.'

91
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,429
- 'During a raid? '
- 'During a raid, you see.'

92
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,397
'He said,
"Why aren't you in that shelter?"'

93
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,062
- 'Why weren't you? '
- 'Well, because... '

94
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,663
I was sorry to hear
about Control, Mr Smiley.

95
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,924
'He said Tarr called him
from a phone box.'

96
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,773
He said there's a mole,

97
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,194
right at the top of the Circus,

98
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,986
that he's been there for years.

99
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,296
It does mean

100
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,424
you're rather well placed
to look into this matter for us now,

101
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,597
doesn't it?

102
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,387
Outside the family.

103
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,941
I'm retired, Oliver.

104
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,284
You fired me.

105
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,278
The thing is,

106
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,326
some time ago before Control died,

107
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,040
he came to me
with a similar suggestion.

108
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,415
That there is a mole.

109
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,709
He never mentioned
his suspicions to you?

110
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,132
No.

111
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,883
Oh, I just thought that
as you were his man, so to speak...

112
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,351
What did you say to him?

113
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,266
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia
had rather gotten the better of him

114
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,357
and he was going to pull
his whole house down.

115
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,601
That bloody mess in Budapest.

116
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,990
Damn it, George.

117
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,201
It's your generation, your legacy.

118
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,990
I would have thought, if there's
any truth in it, you'd want to...

119
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,068
I'll k eep Peter.

120
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,827
And there's a retired
Special Branch man, Mendel.

121
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,080
I should lik e to have him.

122
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,494
- Lift up.

123
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,503
And quickly down again.

124
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,014
There's a place I know, sir.
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

125
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:24,171
Be careful with it. Please.
It's Georgian.

126
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,094
My friend wants peace and quiet
in order to work, Mrs Pope Graham.

127
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,342
No disturbances.

128
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,811
Her real name is just Graham.

129
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,056
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

130
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,871
'Peter, did you get the k eys
to Control's flat? '

131
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:05,629
# And did those feet in ancient time

132
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,008
# Walk upon England's
mountains green #

133
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,811
Oh!

134
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,104
'George! '

135
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,565
George, get in here!

136
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,864
George.

137
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,580
Sit down.

138
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,083
Tak e a look at this nonsense.

139
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,594
Report by Soviet high command

140
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,591
on their recent naval exercises
in the Black Sea.

141
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,389
Just what the admiralty
has been begging us

142
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,227
for some information on.

143
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,606
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't.

144
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,600
Percy and his little cabal
walk ed in with it.

145
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,819
- Look, Control...
- Shut up.

146
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,984
Style appalling.

147
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,109
Patently a fabrication
from beginning to end.

148
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,363
- Just could be the real thing.
- Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

149
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,208
But its topicality mak es it suspect.

150
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,625
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

151
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,590
Where did it come from?
What's the access?

152
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,709
A new secret source of mine.

153
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,506
But how could he
possibly have access?

154
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,802
He has access to the most sensitive
levels of policy-making.

155
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,308
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

156
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,395
Oh, Percy and his pals
bypassed us, Smiley.

157
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,684
Gone straight to the minister.

158
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:08,106
Percy has been allowed to k eep
the identity of his new friend

159
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,648
top secret.

160
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,400
The minister agrees too many secrets
are blown around here.

161
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,446
Too much failure,
too many scandals.

162
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,912
- Too little solid intelligence.
- Percy does have a point, Control.

163
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,657
We should be fighting Communism,
not each other.

164
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,501
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation,
our partners.

165
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,961
Your bloody Yank s!

166
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,502
We've had enough!
There's going to be changes.

167
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,422
We need to decide if want to be
part of the past or part of the future.

168
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,671
I should have left you
where I found you.

169
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,844
- Look!
- Control...

170
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,683
Out, all of you!

171
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,792
If Witchcraft is genuine...

172
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,253
Nothing is genuine any more.

173
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,606
George...

174
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,647
Do you want me to get
this stuff over to the hotel?

175
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,969
Thank you. Er, anywhere will do.

176
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,342
- Peter?
- Hm?

177
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,842
I need you to do something for me.

178
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,444
I'd lik e you to go to the Circus.

179
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,159
'Ln the cabinet
at the duty officers' station

180
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,528
'are records of staff recently retired.

181
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,623
'I'd like photographs of them

182
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:32,167
'and of the diagram of the Circus's
reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

183
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,960
'along with a list of all payments
made from the Reptile fund.'

184
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,420
- Help you with anything, Bill?
- I was just looking for his Majesty.

185
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,710
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

186
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,919
Oh.

187
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:59,174
- Heard you had an accident, Peter.
- Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

188
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,010
When are you going
to get some new furniture up here?

189
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,388
I'll have a word with Esterhase.
We'll mak e it a priority on the top floor.

190
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,887
- Where are you off to?
- Lunch.

191
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,104
Want some company?

192
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,232
According to the personnel files,

193
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,945
seven were due for retirement anyway.

194
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,315
Another four don't seem
particularly mysterious.

195
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,444
Jerry Westerby was dismissed
December 4.

196
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,488
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

197
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,788
That's just two week s
after you and Control were forced out.

198
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,213
- Return to Oxford, please.
- That's 1. 15.

199
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,779
Percy has always resisted
any proposal

200
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,700
of a wider exploitation
of Witchcraft's intelligence.

201
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,697
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

202
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,667
I've refused to share Witchcraft
with our allies so far, Minister.

203
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,829
Greedy boy.

204
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,458
My goal has been to establish
its track record beyond all doubt.

205
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,383
I think the time has come to approach
our American brothers-in-arms.

206
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,977
- Will they tak e us back into bed?
- I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

207
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,603
I want on-going access
to American intelligence.

208
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,319
You think we can get it?

209
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,191
With Witchcraft on our side, we can
get anything we bloody well want.

210
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,954
Fine.

211
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,074
Carry on.

212
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,790
Thank you.

213
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,888
And I strik e thee down...

214
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,703
Oh, I, er...

215
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,751
Not supposed to.
Doctor's orders.

216
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,426
Wicked, wick ed George.

217
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,412
I don't know about you, George,

218
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,032
but I feel seriously under-fuck ed.

219
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,042
I heard Ann left you again.

220
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,924
She doesn't deserve you, George,
not one hair on your head.

221
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:35,299
You left the Circus
shortly after I retired.

222
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,928
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

223
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,933
Chuck ed out on the rubbish heap,
lik e you.

224
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,058
Why?

225
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,694
'Polyak ov.

226
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,693
'Do you remember him? '

227
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,992
'From the Soviet Embassy? '

228
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,084
'Alexsey Polyak ov,
cultural attaché here in London.

229
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,539
'When he arrived here 15 years ago,
I requested he be check ed out.

230
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,336
'He was graded whiter than white.
Didn't put a foot wrong.'

231
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,593
'But you disagreed? '

232
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,511
'There's a story
you must have heard

233
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,602
'that Karla has set up a secret cell.

234
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,686
'The personnel are all ex-military,

235
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,900
'trained to handle
deep-penetration agents, moles.'

236
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,815
'There are always stories,
Connie. '

237
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,439
'But what if this story was true?

238
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:38,195
'One night in research
I saw something, George.

239
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,823
'There was our friend Polyak ov
at a May day parade in Berlin

240
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,576
'receiving a salute.'

241
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,500
'Why would you salute
a cultural attaché? '

242
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,341
'Exactly.
Unless he was a war veteran himself.'

243
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,179
And if he was, why hide the fact?

244
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,968
What did you do?

245
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,716
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

246
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,019
Here.

247
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,561
Polyak ov is a Karla-trained hood
if ever I saw one.

248
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,809
If he's here, it must be
because he's running a mole.

249
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,027
You're to leave Polyak ov alone.

250
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,272
You're becoming obsessed with him.

251
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,448
- You're losing your sense of proportion.
- But that's ridiculous.

252
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,698
Perhaps it's time
you went out into the real world.

253
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:39,173
What does it matter?
Old Circus is gone anyway.

254
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,028
Here we are.

255
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,197
The N ursery in our day.

256
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,285
Jim Prideaux.

257
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,035
And Bill Haydon.
Together, of course.

258
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,541
The Inseparables.

259
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,838
There's Control himself.

260
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,633
All my boys.

261
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,716
All my lovely boys.

262
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,766
That was a good time, George.

263
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,605
A real war.

264
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,902
Englishmen could be proud then.

265
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,950
So I was right, then?

266
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,373
About Polyak ov.

267
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,371
There is a mole.

268
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:02,424
If it's bad, don't come back.
I want to remember you all as you were.

269
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,019
Percy?
Percy, did you mix this?

270
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,976
Aye, I did so.

271
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,822
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

272
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,113
Can you nae learn
to tak e a bloody order?

273
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,328
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

274
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,288
- I followed the recipe.
- Come on.

275
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,534
It'll tak e us five hours
to get drunk on this monk ey's piss.

276
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,712
# He's not the first

277
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,711
- # He's not the first
- Oh, well.

278
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,839
- # He's the second best secret agent
- Merry Christmas.

279
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,886
# I n the whole wide world

280
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,510
# He's not number one

281
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,184
# But not the worst

282
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,023
# He's just the second best
secret agent

283
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,894
# I n the whole wide world

284
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,691
# He's every bit

285
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,030
# As good as what's-his-name

286
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,031
# With a dame

287
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,449
# Any dame

288
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,951
# And all those bullet holes
are in his vest

289
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,038
# To prove you work a little harder

290
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,460
# When you're second best... #

291
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,994
- Courtesy of Mrs P.
- H m?

292
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,204
You been up all night?

293
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,991
Yes.

294
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,045
What's this?

295
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:30,013
Request for £ 1,000 in cash
from the Reptile fund.

296
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,348
To a Mr Ellis.

297
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,059
It was one of J im Prideaux's
work names.

298
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,059
Prideaux was killed
in H ungary a year ago.

299
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,648
October 21.

300
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,653
So why was someone giving him
£ 1,000 two months later?

301
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,617
I wonder where he is then, sir.

302
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,769
Settle down now.

303
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,154
- Hand those out.
- Sir.

304
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,152
What is it?
The H unchback of Notre-Dame?

305
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,913
The bells, the bells!

306
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,895
- Ohh!

307
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,285
Come here.

308
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,886
- I'm a new boy.
- New arrival, eh?

309
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,178
- What's the story?
- My mother and father.

310
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,261
My father left, so...

311
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,728
Hm.

312
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,307
Bill.

313
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,150
The unpaid Bill.

314
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,651
- Anyone ever call you that?
- No, sir.

315
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,866
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

316
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,116
They've all been good 'uns.

317
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,199
What are you good at?

318
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,826
Nothing, sir.

319
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,796
You're a good watcher, though, eh?

320
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,464
Us loners always are.

321

I didn't sleep well.

You're going to do something
for me, Peter.

484
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,650
I need the duty officer's log book
for last November.

485
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:43,573
I'm going to have to send you
up a floor into the lions' den.

486

If you're caught,

487
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,714
I'm sorry, but you're alone.

488
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,711
- Last November?
- Hm.

489

490
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,768
Thank you, Bryant.

How's the family?

492
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,652
Fine. Need to go
up to the registry today.

493
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,320
OK, sir.

494
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:26,328
Now you'll need
a yellow one for the bag, sir.

495
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,203
Thank you.

496

- Good morning, Mr Guillam.
- Morning, Alwyn.

497
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,985
- Want me to look after that for you?
- Thank you.

498
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,818
I'll need your chit, Mr Guillam.

499

Dolphin will kill me if I don't.
New rules.

So, chit me.

- Peter.

503

- Oh, you know.

I'll bet.

Corridor D.

The two eights are halfway
on your right.

508
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,369
The three ones are next alcove down.

Tak e it away, George.'

Hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.

'Can I speak

Well, I'll just see if he's available.
Hold on, please.

- Telephone, sir.

- Who is it?
- Outside line, sir. Someone rough.

Sir?

- Hello?
- (Mendel) 'Your gearbox is bust, sir.'

Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?

'Can't be done, sir.

Well, phone the main dealership first.
Have you got their number?

524
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,418
'No.'

525
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,538

- Hello?
- 'I'm listening.'

532

- Yes. 9-4-60-3-3-5.

Peter Guillam.

535
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:54,050
Could we see you, please?

536
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,138
Percy would lik e
quite an urgent word with you.

537
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,179
If you can come now to the fifth floor
that would be so kind.

538
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,768
Yes, of course.

539
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,765
Throw that into the lift for me.

540
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,438
Send it to the second floor,
save me filling out bloody chits.

541
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,231
Will do, sir.

542
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,132
So what have you been getting up to
down there these days?

543
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,547
Apart from chasing our virgins.

544
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,048
A couple of Arab ploys
that look quite promising.

545
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,435
Apart from that,
I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

546
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,395
Arabs.

547
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:47,140
You can rent one but you can't buy one.
Right, Bill?

548
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,487
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

549
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,528
Fine. We have tea
at Fortnum's every afternoon.

550
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,158
I require the matter
of your discussion with Tarr.

551
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,452
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

552
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,166
What's that shrug for?

553
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,050
I'm talking to you about the traitor

554
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,675
who cut the throat
of our man in Istanbul.

555
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:25,144
I'm talking to you about a defector
from your own damn section.

556
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:29,186
I'm accusing you of consorting
with an enemy agent behind my back.

557
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,651
Don't damn well shrug at me!

558
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,737
How would you lik e a term in prison?

559
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,535
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

560
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,839
So get your facts straight
and get off my back!

561
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:56,801
So... if I told you
Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

562
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,716
would you be surprised?

563
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,009
No, nothing would surprise me
about Ricki Tarr.

564
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:05,890
And if I told you we happen to know
£30,000 mysteriously appeared

565
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,263
in his bank account last month,

566
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,731
would that surprise you?

567
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,986
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

568
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:22,485
Turned by the opposition months ago
and now they've sent him back to us.

569
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:25,409
- What for?
- Never mind what for.

570
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,079
To muddy the water,
that's what for.

571
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:32,124
To spread a whole lot of damn
nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

572
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:33,667
The point is this.

573
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,381
He's heading for home.

574
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,635
The first peep from him,
you come to the grown-ups.

575
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,469
Understood?

576
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:44,136
Anyone you see around this table
but not another damn soul.

577
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,557
Get out.

578
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,395
Peter?

579
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,610
Thank you, Belinda.

580
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,035
# Oh, Mr Wu

581
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,911
# What shall I do?

582
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,169

583
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,092
# What shall I do?

# Mr Wu... #

585
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,399
All go smoothly, did it?

586
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,314
I need to go to the hotel
to see George.

587
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,439
Mr Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir.
Change of venue.

588
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,827
George?

589
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,257
Mr Guillam...

590
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,424
Sorry it took me so long
to come home.

591
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,446
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

592
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,657
He's been telling us
all about his adventures.

593
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,694
He's a double, George.

594
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,788
There is no mole. Whole thing's
been thought up by Moscow.

595
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,158
Karla bought him for £30,000.

596
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:36,161
I stole that because of you.

597
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:39,881
I spied on my own because of him.
Do you know how that mak es me feel?

598
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,249
Ricki...

599
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:45,004
you said you sent the Circus a telegram
concerning Irina's information.

600
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,050
- That's right.
- What was the date?

601
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,174
He doesn't know
because there was no telegram.

602
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,802
- The whole thing is a fabrication.
- 20th November.

603
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,022
It must have been 20th November.
Evening.

604
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,687
'lrina k ept telling me
in Moscow Centre

605
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,357
'everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

606
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:05,232
- 'She told me Karla... '
- November 20th is missing.

607
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:09,361
Someone is covering their track s,
unless of course you think

608
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,362
that's just a coincidence?

609
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:17,084
What about the money?

610
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:21,081
30,000 isn't so much for Karla
to pay if it protects his mole.

611
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,507
I'm afraid someone in the Circus
knows all about Mr Tarr

612
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,597
and is doing everything they can
to discredit him.

613
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:34,140
'... everything the Circus think s
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.'

614
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,728
Why didn't you tell me
that you had Tarr?

615
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,571
In case I never made it
out of the Circus.

616
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,783
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

617
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,835
Come up.

618
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,799
I met him once.

619
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,761
Karla.

620
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,806
In '55.

621
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,273
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

622
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:30,491
Purge after purge.

623
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,986
Half their agents were jumping ship.

624
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,664
I travelled around, signing them up.

625
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,662
Hundreds of them.

626
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:46,169
One of them
was calling himself Gerstmann.

627
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,335
He was on his way back to Russia

628
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:52,930
and we were pretty sure
he was going to be executed.

629
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:57,553
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi
and that's how long I had

630
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,805
to convince him to come over to us

631
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,024
instead of going home to die.

632
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,489
There's a little room.

633
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,621
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

634
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:24,670
The Americans had had him tortured.

635
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,843
He had no fingernails.

636
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,675
It's incredibly hot.

637
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:45,525
I'm very tired and all I want to do
is get this over with and get back home.

638
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,855
Things weren't going well with Ann.

639
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,451
I give him the usual pitch.

640
01:12:56,581 --> 01:13:00,665
"Come to the West
and we can give you a comfortable life,

641
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,709
"after questioning."

642
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,548
What did he say?

643
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,513
"Think of your wife.

644
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,347
"You have a wife, don't you?

645
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,729
"Here. I brought you some cigarettes,
by the way.

646
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,569
"Use my lighter.

647
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:43,954
"We could arrange for her to join you.
We have a lot of stock to trade.

648
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,163
"If you go back, she'll be ostracised.
Think of her.

649
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,006
"Think about..."

650
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,255
I kept on...

651
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,975
...harping on about the damn wife,

652
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,604
telling him more about me than...

653
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,277
I should have walk ed out, of course.

654
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,532
"We're not so very different you and I.

655
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,826
"We've both spent our lives

656
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:30,296
"looking for the weaknesses
in one another's systems.

657
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,668
"Don't you think it's time to recognise

658
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:40,265
"there is as little worth on your side
as there is on mine?"

659
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,480
Never said a word.

660
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,829
Not one word.

661
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,716
And the next morning
he got back on his plane.

662
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,008
He handed the pack of cigarettes
back to me, untouched.

663
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:24,180
This was a chain-smok er, mind.

664
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:28,520
And he flew off to what
he presumed would be his death.

665
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,230
He k ept my lighter.

666
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,823
It was a gift.

667
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,161
"To George from Ann.

668
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,449
"All my love."

669
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,287
That was Karla.

670
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,258
He went back to die
rather than giving in.

671
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,882
Yes, and that's how I k now
he can be beaten.

672
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,062
Because he's a fanatic.

673
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:15,477
And the fanatic is always
concealing a secret doubt.

674
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,900
What did he look lik e?

675
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,120
I can't remember.

676
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,887
After today, Peter,

677
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,773
you have to assume
they're watching you.

678
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,693
If there's anything you need tidied up,

679
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,029
now is the time.

680
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,129
Nearly done.

681
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,223
For God's sak e.

682
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:35,561
Sometimes I think they're all
sharing the same moronic brain.

683
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,861
If there's someone else,
you can tell me.

684
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,244
I'm a grown-up.

685
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:34,453
I know. It's just going to be
such a wonderful Christmas.

686
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,075
Excuse me.

687
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:47,633
# And I was too proud to give in

688
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:58,227
# I had to learn the hard way

689
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,563
- # That pride... #
- Peter, when you're ready

690
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,106
Put it on now.

691
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,569
Everybody!

692
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,692
- Jerry.
- George.

693
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,312
- Peter.
- Jerry.

694
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,400
I need to talk to you.

695
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:35,118
About the night J im Prideaux was killed.

696
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,122
You were duty officer, weren't you?

697
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:43,706
Yeah. Control ask ed me
to man the phones that night.

698
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:47,631
He said someone was doing
a special job for the service.

699
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,546
He wanted someone he could trust.

700
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:54,467
'Hurricane Henry set
to be ridden by Ray Walsh at 7:2... '

701
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,789
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

702
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,340
This is from the FO resident clerk.

703
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,963
A Hungarian news bulletin.

704
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,261
"British spy, work name Ellis,

705
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,555

707

"He's been shot.

708
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,694
"Other arrests imminent."

709
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:56,533
Can I have a brief, please?

710
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,871
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

711
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,799
'I couldn't get a word out of Control.

712
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:16,045
'So I followed protocol
and went for the emergency list.'

713
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,350
You rang my house.

714
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:23,969
J ust on the off-chance
you were back from Berlin.

715
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,516
What did you say?

716
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,524
- 'Hello? '
- Hello, Mrs Smiley.

717
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,734
It's Jerry.
Jerry Westerby from the office.

718
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:33,149
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

719
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,364
Ann said you wasn't back yet
and that was it.

720
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:37,657
Go on.

721
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,322
All hell brok e loose.

722
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,912
Military yelling about
Hungarian tank s on the border.

723
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,656
Lacon and the minister
baying at the door.

724
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:48,251
Thank Christ
Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

725
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,586
- Mr Haydon.
- Not now.

726
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,080
Mr Haydon!

727
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:53,623
Out!

728
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,340
- Tell me.
- I tried to get hold of you.

729
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:00,636
I got half a story
on the tick er tape at my club. Tell me.

730
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:03,717
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

731
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,182
Get me the H ungarian embassy.

732
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,150
You tell your masters what will happen

733
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,144
if one hair on J im Prideaux's head
is damaged.

734
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:17,193
Get Esterhase on the phone.
Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

735
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,315
Yes, sir.

736
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,959
Any more news on him? Sir?

737
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,386
Oh, God.

738
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:42,177
We need to get down to his flat,
clear out anything link ed.

739
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:27,468
Haydon heard the news at his club?

740
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:31,934
At 1: 30? The tick er-tape
wouldn't have been running.

741
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,773
So how did he know?

742
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:36,860
- Jesus, George.
- Peter!

743
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,526
- How could he have known?
- It's not what you think.

744
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:43,571
- Then how did he know?
- He was at my house that night.

745
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,774
Good flight?

746
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,399
Yes.

747
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:22,488
Pleasant enough.

748
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,483
I was just passing.
I thought I'd call in.

749
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:28,654
Ann was in bed.
She insisted on getting up.

750
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:31,031
She said she'd be down in a minute.

751
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:36,332
That's what I'm dropping off.
It's an awful daub really.

752
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,336
But Ann expressed a liking.

753
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,303
What's k eeping her?

754
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:03,358
Keep going.

755
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:06,650
Come on, lads. Keep up.

756
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,367
Come on, Bill!

757
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:27,175
- Got your specs on, J umbo?
- Yes, sir.

758
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,922
Come here.

759
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,515
Who's that fellow down there?

760
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,393
I don't know, sir.

761
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,566
Who is he?

762
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,564
Beggar man?

763
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:47,157
Thief?

764
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,403
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

765
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:55,374
Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch
of boys flogging a car round a field?

766
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,912
What's the matter with him?
Doesn't he lik e us?

767
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,085
I don't hold with odd-bods
hanging around.

768
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,800
He might steal the Alvis.

769
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,215
- Which is?
- The best car in England, sir.

770
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:13,433
Good lad.

771
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:26,814
How were you briefed
for the Budapest mission?

772
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,987
Control ask ed me
to come to a flat in Kensington.

773
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:35,197
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

774
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:39,246
And we have to find it.

775
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,464
What did you mak e of it, Jim?

776
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,584
Control's theory?

777
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,712
I thought it was madness.

778
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:55,263
I know that it is one of five men.

779
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:00,601
All I want from you is one code name.

780
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,026
Alleline.

781
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,901
Tink er.

782
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,078
Haydon.

783
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,448
Tailor.

784
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,618
Bland.

785
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,622
Soldier.

786
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:29,885
We drop Sailor.
It's too close to Tailor.

787
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:32,174
And Rich Man doesn't seem
to be applicable.

788
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:35,682
Esterhase.

789
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:39,887
Poor Man.

790
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,935
And the fifth?

791
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,731
Smiley.

792
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:56,699
I thought it was madness.

793
01:28:58,124 --> 01:29:01,241
To think that any one of you
could have been a traitor.

794
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,499
Absolute madness.

795
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,341
'But you still went.

796

Everything.

810

I held on for as long as I could to let
everyone get the hell out of there.

Did they?

My network s in H ungary,
did they get out?

813

No, they were blown.

814
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,880
The story is you blew them
to save your own skin.

What was your last line of defence, hm?

819
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:43,324
The mole.

820
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,824
Control's crazy theory.

821
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:52,416
I was going to bury that so deep
they'd never get it out of me.

822
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,209
- Which was a jok e.
- Why?

823
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:01,254
Because they already knew.

824
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:04,929
All they wanted to know was how far
Control had got in his investigation.

825
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:22,488
No, I don't know her.

826

Did they ask about me at all?

827
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,717
Yes.

828
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,721
The little fellow did.

What did he say about me?

830
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,730
He had this cigarette lighter.

He k ept flashing it about
for me to see it.

He said when he was being debriefed

Told him he was dead now.
Couldn't come back.

Tink er, Tailor. All of it.

847
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,196
Yes, that's what I thought.

848
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:35,621
How on earth did Esterhase
hear about Tink er, Tailor?

This meeting is not taking place.
Is that clear?

861
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:41,117
Perfectly, Minister.

862
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:51,007
There is a house
somewhere in this city

863
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:55,849
where Alleline and the others meet
Witchcraft's London representative.

864
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:58,093
I thought Lacon had made it
clear to you.

865
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:01,847
Keep your nose bloody well
out of Witchcraft's business.

866
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:03,814
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

867
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:06,525
You told me
to follow in Control's footsteps.

868
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:11,318
I wouldn't consider that sound advice,
given the mess Control left us with.

869
01:37:12,452 --> 01:37:16,661
It has tak en Alleline
and, if I may say so, myself

870
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,825
this long to get us back in the game.

871
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:23,960
The man Alleline and the others
meet is called Polyak ov.

872

'From Witchcraft to you.

875

That, er...
That's not possible.

876
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,806
Made possible.

877
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:48,355
By you in the house you persuaded
the Treasury to pay for.

878
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:54,449
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine.
It's been gold.

879
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:58,866
It's just enough glitter
amongst the chick en feed.

880
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:01,865
Control didn't believe in miracles
or in Witchcraft.

881
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:03,741
But you were lazy and greedy

882
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:07,962
and so you hounded him
out of the Circus and you let Karla in.

883
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:14,885
You opened negotiations to exchange
intelligence with the Americans.

884
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:18,677
What they tell the C ircus,
they'll be telling the Kremlin.

885
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:24,271
Witchcraft's information,
the "gold" Karla let you have,

886
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,515
it wasn't to lure you.

887
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:28,892
It was to lure the Americans.

888
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,778
Now,

889
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,023
do you want to tak e credit for that?

890
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:41,404
What can we do?

891
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:47,623
We have one thing the mole wants.

892
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,173
- If I go to Paris...
- You'll go.

893
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:55,088
If I go to Paris,

894
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,339
I want your word
that you will get Irina back.

895
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:04,477
I don't care who you have to trade.
And I am out.

896
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:11,313
I want a family, thank you.
I do not want to end up lik e you lot.

897
01:39:11,446 --> 01:39:13,732
You will get her back.

898
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:19,108
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

899
01:39:44,145 --> 01:39:46,261
Oh, hello, George.

900
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:48,854
Hello.

901
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,212
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

902
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:23,215
Control recruited you, didn't he?

903
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:26,514
Found you starving
in a museum in Vienna.

904
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:29,183
A wanted man.

905
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:31,351
Saved your life, I heard.

906
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,643
And yet when the time came,

907
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:37,191
when it came to picking sides
between him and Alleline,

908
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:39,234
you didn't hesitate.

909
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:44,035
That's understandable, perhaps,
with your war experience.

910
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:48,907
You survived this long, I suppose,
because of your ability to change sides.

911
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:51,125
Serve any master.

912
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:59,466
What? What's...
What's this about, George?

913
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:03,797
It's about which master
you've been serving, Toby.

914
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,428
'I ntelligence
has been leak ed, Toby.

917

This is a mistak e, a misunderstanding.

918
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:21,238
Files were delivered
to a Russian attaché, weren't they?

919
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:22,482
Yes.

920
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:27,032
'And, yes, I delivered them.'

Things aren't always
what they seem, George.

You should know that.

Every now and then we give him
the odd file to tak e back to them.

for Jim Prideaux
to forget about Tink er, Tailor?

- Bland.
- To get rid of Connie Sachs?

- Westerby?
- Bland.

Anything to serve Witchcraft.

946

I know all about your secret source.

947

01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:36,615
No, you've got to believe me.

954
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:39,084
George, please.

955
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,378
I am loyal.

956
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:48,503
I... I am loyal.

957
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:01,979
Don't... Don't...
Don't send me back.

958
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:03,976
Please, George.

959
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,604
Don't send me back.

960
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:14,203
Give me the address.

961
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,830
Where do you meet Polyak ov?

962
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,758
Hey, hey!
Dog, dog, be quiet!

963
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:39,641
What is this? Who are you?

964
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:59,786
- What are the safety signals?
- The air vent.

965
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:02,285
Open and all's well,
closed and you're not to enter.

966
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:08,169
And the microphone?

967
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:16,465
Peter?

968
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:36,069
The boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but he had fled

969
01:45:36,205 --> 01:45:38,662
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone brightly o'er the dead

970
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:42,992
'Beautiful and proud he stood
as born to rule the storm

971
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:46,370
'A creature of blood,
a proud though child-lik e form'

972
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:49,169
- The flames rolled on...

973
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:03,266
Merci. Au revoir.

974
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:37,971
Go on.

975
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,891
The whole service is looking for you.

976
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:51,394
- They'll skin you alive if they find you.
- Maybe I want them to find me.

977
01:46:53,115 --> 01:46:56,278
You can go now. Leave the book s
and put the k eys in the machines.

978
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:59,072
No, Ben stays here.

979
01:46:59,204 --> 01:47:04,574
Ricki Tarr claims to have information
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

980
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,768
'Mr Smiley? '

981
01:47:31,236 --> 01:47:32,601
Taxi approaching Circus.

982
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:46,452
Tink er.

983
01:47:57,388 --> 01:47:59,174
Tailor.

984
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,218
Here comes Soldier.

985
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:12,600
'Full house.'

986
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:31,207
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.
- "Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

987
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:36,673
"Require clarification
before meeting your request.

988
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:43,844
"Quote, information vital
to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote

989
01:48:45,144 --> 01:48:49,387
"does not qualify,
send further information."

990
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:52,606
Ah! That's it, Percy,
you k eep stalling.

991
01:48:52,735 --> 01:48:55,568
I warn you, Ben. We've got
some really lousy people in this outfit.

992
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:57,937
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

993
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:08,034
'The meeting's over.

994
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:12,372
'They're leaving.'

995
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:15,952
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

996
01:53:17,749 --> 01:53:21,492
I k eep thinking how much
I'm going to miss the crick et in Moscow.

997
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:32,678
I was rather hoping you might do
a little light housek eeping for me.

998
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:36,135
If I can.

999
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:41,478
There's a girl.
Give her some money, would you?

1000
01:53:41,606 --> 01:53:43,813
And give her a good cover story.

1001
01:53:46,028 --> 01:53:48,861
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1002
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,695
It's all there.

1003
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:54,908
And there's a boy, too.
Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1004
01:53:57,247 --> 01:54:01,331
I know the inquisitors' bag of trick s.
I taught most of them.

1005
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,998
It's just a reaction.

1006
01:54:07,966 --> 01:54:10,503
An over-reaction, if you lik e.

1007
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:13,342
I did have one or two questions.

1008
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:19,049
- About Prideaux.
- Goddamn it!

1009
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:22,098
- I got him back, didn't I?
- Yes, yes, you did.

1010
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:28,517
I am surprised
Karla didn't have him shot.

1011
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:32,817
Or do you think he held back,

1012
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:35,531
out of delicacy towards you?

1013
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:43,825
Did Prideaux come and see you
before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1014
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,712
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1015
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:53,376
To say what?

1016
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:00,715
To warn you.

1017
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:05,228
Because he knew deep down

1018
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:08,397
it was you all along.

1019
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:15,192
So did you.

1020
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:21,616
I had to pick a side, George.

1021
01:55:23,291 --> 01:55:26,579
It was an aesthetic choice
as much as a moral one.

1022
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:31,004
And the West has become
so very ugly.

1023
01:55:32,134 --> 01:55:33,874
Don't you think?

1024
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:39,179
Did Karla ever consider
having you tak e over the Circus?

1025
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:41,639
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1026
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:44,259
What are you, then, Bill?

1027
01:55:50,902 --> 01:55:53,143
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1028
01:56:06,918 --> 01:56:11,582
Is there anything particular
you want me to pass on to Ann?

1029
01:56:15,343 --> 01:56:19,837
Oh, that was nothing personal, George.
I hope you understand that.

1030
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:22,339
Karla said you were good,

1031
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:25,593
the one we had to worry about.

1032
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:29,187
But you do have a blind spot.

1033
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:31,682
He reck oned
if I was known to be Ann's lover,

1034
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:36,061
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

1035
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:39,522
And he was right.

1036
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:42,908
Up to a point.

1037
01:56:46,416 --> 01:56:48,156
Up to a point.

1038
01:57:15,403 --> 01:57:17,359
I made this for you, sir.

1039
01:57:26,164 --> 01:57:29,247
I don't want you
hanging around here any more.

1040
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:33,251
Keep away from me from now on.

1041
01:57:34,673 --> 01:57:37,255
- Go and join the others.
- But...

1042
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:40,251
Just... Just bloody join in, will you?

1043
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:46,556
Go and play, damn you!

1044
01:58:04,035 --> 01:58:06,697
Could you check, Jerry?
