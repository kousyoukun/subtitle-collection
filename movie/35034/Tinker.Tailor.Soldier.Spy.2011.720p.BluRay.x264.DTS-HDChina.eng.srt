1
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,970
You weren't followed?

2
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,840
No.

3
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,830
Better come in.

4
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,640
Trust no one, Jim.

5
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,460
Especially not in the mainstream.

6
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,260
Sit down.

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,360
I understand you still have one Hungarian identity running?

8
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,220
I do.

9
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,750
I want you to go to Budapest.

10
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,060
This is not above board.

11
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,180
Nobody else knows.

12
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,730
They're after my head, Jim boy.

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,750
Do you understand?

14
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,910
I have had an offer of service.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,110
A Hungarian general wants to come over.

16
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,690
I would like you to meet him.

17
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,320
He has some information that I need, Jim.

18
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,620
What information?

19
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,550
Treasure.

20
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,870
He has the name of the mole...

21
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,380
the Russians have planted in the British intelligence service...

22
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,630
right at the top of the Circus.

23
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,830
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

24
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,130
We have to find it.

25
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,870
Stop!

26
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,020
Would you witness this for me?

27
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,870
I wish I could done more, Control.

28
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,920
You did all you could, Percy.

29
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,210
Well, a man should know when to leave the party.

30
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,250
What about Smiley?

31
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,710
Smiley is leaving with me.

32
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,060
You little prick, Esterhase.

33
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,490
Gentlemen, shall we start?

34
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,930
Under Secretary Lacon is ready for you, Sir Percy.

35
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,860
The Treasury don't understand.

36
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,220
Why can't the intelligence service simply put in a request

37
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,750
for a general increase in funding

38
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,790
and then you account for the spend on your special operation?

39
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,600
Operation Witchcraft needs to remain secret.

40
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,130
It's a fiefdom of its own.

41
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,260
Yes, that's what's worrying us.

42
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,260
The whole thing's very unaccountable, isn't it?

43
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,810
And this London house that nobody knows the address of,

44
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,290
is that really necessary?

45
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,590
Now more than ever. We need to protect our Soviet source.

46
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,350
So where do you propose we meet? In a cafe?

47
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,920
The rent and rates on this house have doubled.

48
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,130
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

49
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,460
We're asking for a few thousand for a house.

50
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,530
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

51
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,180
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

52
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,880
Look, nobody underestimates

53
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,520
the importance of the job you chaps are doing.

54
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,750
But what happened in Budapest last year,

55
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,030
that was a disaster.

56
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,770
With respect, sir,

57
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,850
it wasn't one of your civil servants that got killed, was it?

58
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,420
Now this isn't about soldiers in trenches any more.

59
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,600
- We're the front line now... - Roy!

60
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,210
For 25 years we've been the

61
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,490
only thing standing between them and Karla

62
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,870
and Moscow and the third bloody world war.

63
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,520
Look, the Minister's very pleased with your progress so far.

64
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,870
He's less pleased, though,

65
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,880
with the lack of progress with our American cousins.

66
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,070
You see,

67
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,060
in their eyes,

68
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,440
you're still a leaky ship.

69
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,420
Yes?

70
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,760
Someone on the line for you, sir. Seems urgent.

71
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,250
All right, well put him through.

72
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,040
- Hello? - Is this Under Secretary Lacon?

73
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,700
Yes.

74
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,190
My name's Ricki Tarr.

75
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,390
- What do you want? - I need to meet you.

76
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,330
If you need to confirm who I am,

77
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,800
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

78
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,900
Peter Guillam.

79
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,630
But only Guillam, no one else.

80
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,420
You got clearance for that?

81
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,860
Well, I'm not bloody chaining it up outside.

82
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,910
Mind you, no better off in

83
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,870
here with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

84
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,250
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

85
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,580
Thought I'd pop in and catch a

86
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,770
glimpse of the new girl before Bland gets to her.

87
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,140
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

88
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,260
- Has he seen her yet? - Of course he has.

89
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
Came down first thing this morning.

90
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,440
Belinda.

91
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,280
Peter Guillam.

92
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,840
Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

93
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,960
Just ringing to find out...

94
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,490
So Winston Churchill saved your life, Edie.

95
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,290
I was working in the kitchen, getting dinner ready.

96
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,840
And he was late, you see.

97
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,920
- During a raid? - During a raid, you see.

98
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,560
He said, "Why aren't you in that shelter?"

99
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,500
- Why weren't you? - Well, because...

100
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,450
I was sorry to hear about Control, Mr. Smiley.

101
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,330
He said Tarr called him from a phone box.

102
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,090
He said there's a mole,

103
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,370
right at the top of the Circus,

104
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,900
that he's been there for years.

105
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,170
It does mean

106
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,570
you're rather well placed to look into this matter for us now,

107
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,270
doesn't it?

108
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,330
Outside the family.

109
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,570
I'm retired, Oliver.

110
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,460
You fired me.

111
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,970
The thing is,

112
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,560
some time ago before Control died,

113
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,860
he came to me with a similar suggestion.

114
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,780
That there is a mole.

115
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,510
He never mentioned his suspicions to you?

116
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,920
No.

117
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,410
Oh, I just thought that as you were his man, so to speak...

118
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,700
What did you say to him?

119
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,900
I'm afraid I thought his

120
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,820
paranoia had rather gotten the better of him

121
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,100
and he was going to pull his whole house down.

122
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,040
That bloody mess in Budapest.

123
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,610
Damn it, George.

124
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,310
It's your generation, your legacy.

125
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,010
I would have thought,

126
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,430
if there's any truth in it, you'd want to...

127
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,660
I'll keep Peter.

128
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,420
And there's a retired Special Branch man, Mendel.

129
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,560
I should like to have him.

130
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,710
Lift up.

131
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,060
And quickly down again.

132
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,070
There's a place I know, sir.

133
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,300
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

134
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,290
Be careful with it. Please. It's Georgian.

135
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,150
My friend wants peace and quiet

136
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,330
in order to work, Mrs. Pope Graham.

137
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,530
No disturbances.

138
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,560
Her real name is just Graham.

139
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,160
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

140
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,700
Peter, did you get the keys to Control's flat?

141
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,740
And did those feet in ancient time

142
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,820
walk upon England's mountains green?

143
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,220
George!

144
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,820
George, get in here!

145
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,830
George.

146
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,320
Sit down.

147
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,770
Take a look at this nonsense.

148
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,220
Report by Soviet high command

149
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,220
on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea.

150
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,310
Just what the admiralty has been begging us

151
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,850
for some information on.

152
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,630
- Where did you get this? - I didn't.

153
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,050
Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.

154
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,570
- Look, Control... - Shut up.

155
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,120
Style appalling.

156
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,710
Patently a fabrication from beginning to end.

157
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,810
Just could be the real thing.

158
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,160
Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

159
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,400
But its topicality makes it suspect.

160
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,200
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

161
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,510
Where did it come from? What's the access?

162
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,850
A new secret source of mine.

163
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,670
But how could he possibly have access?

164
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,010
He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy-making.

165
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,540
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

166
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,770
Oh, Percy and his pals bypassed us, Smiley.

167
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,630
Gone straight to the minister.

168
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,600
Percy has been allowed to keep the identity of his new friend

169
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,700
top secret.

170
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,290
The minister agrees too many secrets are blown around here.

171
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,590
Too much failure, too many scandals.

172
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,090
Too little solid intelligence.

173
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,640
Percy does have a point, Control.

174
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,960
We should be fighting Communism, not each other.

175
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,510
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners.

176
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,100
Your bloody Yanks!

177
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,040
We've had enough! There's going to be changes.

178
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,050
We need to decide if want

179
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,580
to be part of the past or part of the future.

180
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,210
I should have left you where I found you.

181
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,710
- Look! - Control...

182
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,920
Out, all of you!

183
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,130
If Witchcraft is genuine...

184
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,630
Nothing is genuine any more.

185
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,240
George...

186
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,730
Do you want me to get this stuff over to the hotel?

187
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,330
Thank you. Uh, anywhere will do.

188
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,230
Peter?

189
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,570
I need you to do something for me.

190
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,970
I'd like you to go to the Circus.

191
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,120
In the cabinet at the duty officers' station

192
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,820
are records of staff recently retired.

193
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,840
I'd like photographs of them

194
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,990
and of the diagram of the

195
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,560
Circus's reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

196
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,370
along with a list of all payments made from the Reptile fund.

197
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,440
Help you with anything, Bill?

198
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,540
I was just looking for his Majesty.

199
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,350
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

200
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,030
Heard you had an accident, Peter.

201
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,240
Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

202
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,440
When are you going to get some new furniture up here?

203
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,410
I'll have a word with Esterhase.

204
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,920
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.

205
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,910
- Where are you off to? - Lunch.

206
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,620
Want some company?

207
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,480
According to the personnel files,

208
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,310
seven were due for retirement anyway.

209
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,820
Another four don't seem particularly mysterious.

210
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,600
Jerry Westerby was dismissed December 4.

211
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,680
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

212
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,460
That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.

213
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,510
- Return to Oxford, please. - That's 1.15.

214
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,930
Percy has always resisted any proposal

215
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,890
of a wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.

216
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,790
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

217
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,040
I've refused to share

218
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,510
Witchcraft with our allies so far, Minister.

219
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,730
Greedy boy.

220
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,900
My goal has been to establish its track record beyond all doubt.

221
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,940
I think the time has come

222
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,830
to approach our American brothers-in-arms.

223
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,860
Will they take us back into bed?

224
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,150
I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

225
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,850
I want on-going access to American intelligence.

226
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,140
You think we can get it?

227
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,320
With Witchcraft on our side,

228
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,420
we can get anything we bloody well want.

229
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,740
Fine.

230
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,400
Carry on.

231
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,950
Thank you.

232
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,830
And I strike thee down...

233
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,080
Oh, I, uh...

234
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,010
Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.

235
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,600
Wicked, wicked George.

236
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,590
I don't know about you, George,

237
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,560
but I feel seriously under-fucked.

238
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,340
I heard Ann left you again.

239
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,700
She doesn't deserve you, George, not one hair on your head.

240
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,400
You left the Circus shortly after I retired.

241
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,020
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

242
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,560
Chucked out on the rubbish heap, like you.

243
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,150
Why?

244
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,120
Polyakov.

245
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,460
Do you remember him?'

246
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,070
From the Soviet Embassy?'

247
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,100
Alexsey Polyakov, cultural attach here in London.

248
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,400
When he arrived here 15 years ago,

249
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,030
I requested he be checked out.

250
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,650
He was graded whiter than white. Didn't put a foot wrong.

251
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,450
But you disagreed?'

252
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,670
There's a story you must have heard

253
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,210
that Karla has set up a secret cell.

254
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,740
The personnel are all ex-military,

255
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,120
trained to handle deep-penetration agents, moles.

256
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,810
There are always stories, Connie.

257
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,690
But what if this story was true?

258
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,950
One night in research I saw something, George.

259
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:42,010
There was our friend Polyakov at a May day parade in Berlin

260
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,070
receiving a salute.

261
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,650
Why would you salute a cultural attach?

262
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:51,550
Exactly. Unless he was a war veteran himself'.

263
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,310
And if he was, why hide the fact?

264
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,850
What did you do?

265
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,060
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

266
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,510
Here.

267
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,610
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood if ever I saw one.

268
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,000
If he's here, it must be because he's running a mole.

269
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,780
You're to leave Polyakov alone.

270
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,140
You're becoming obsessed with him.

271
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,680
You're losing your sense of proportion,Connie.

272
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,850
But that's ridiculous.

273
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,510
Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world.

274
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,810
What does it matter? Old Circus is gone anyway.

275
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,360
Here we are.

276
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,310
The nursery in our day.

277
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,910
Jim Prideaux.

278
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,010
And Bill Haydon. Together, of course.

279
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,790
The inseparables.

280
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,120
There's Control himself.

281
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,030
All my boys.

282
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,730
All my lovely boys.

283
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,710
That was a good time, George.

284
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,620
It was the war, Connie.

285
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,960
A real war.

286
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,040
Englishmen could be proud then.

287
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,250
So I was right, then?

288
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,890
About Polyakov.

289
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,160
There is a mole.

290
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,660
If it's bad, don't come back.

291
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,150
I want to remember you all as you were.

292
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,370
Percy? Percy, did you mix this?

293
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,130
Aye, I did so.

294
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,940
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

295
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,760
Can you nae learn to take a bloody order?

296
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,410
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

297
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,550
- I followed the recipe. - Come on.

298
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,880
It'll take us five hours to get drunk on this monkey's piss.

299
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,150
He's not the first

300
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,820
He's not the first

301
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,550
- He's the second best secret agent - Merry Christmas.

302
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,250
In the whole wide world

303
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,850
He's not number one

304
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,660
But not the worst

305
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,200
He's just the second best secret agent

306
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,730
In the whole wide world

307
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,340
He's every bit

308
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,100
As good as what's-his-name

309
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,240
With a dame

310
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,740
Any dame

311
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,120
And all those bullet holes are in his vest

312
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,220
To prove you work a little harder

313
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,960
When you're second best... ?

314
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,490
Courtesy of Mrs. P.

315
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,840
You been up all night?

316
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,110
Yes.

317
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,430
What's this?

318
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,800
To a Mr. Ellis.

319
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,640
It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.

320
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,890
Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago.

321
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,870
October 21.

322
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,680
I wonder where he is then, sir.

323
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,850
Settle down now.

324
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,720
- Hand those out. - Sir.

325
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,710
What is it? The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?

326
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,840
The bells, the bells!

327
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,900
Come here.

328
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,270
- What's your name? - Roach. Bill Roach, sir.

329
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,040
- I'm a new boy. - New arrival, eh?

330
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,010
- What's the story? - My mother and father.

331
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,370
My father left, so...

332
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,590
Bill.

333
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,680
The unpaid Bill.

334
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,620
- Anyone ever call you that? - No, sir.

335
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,280
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

336
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,470
They've all been good 'uns.

337
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,880
What are you good at?

338
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,740
Nothing, sir.

339
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,320
You're a good watcher, though, eh?

340
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,540
Us loners always are.

341
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,450
Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet.

342
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,360
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right? - Yes, sir.

343
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,220
This is good, very good.

344
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,020
Hello, Ricki.

345
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,240
You've missed the wedge.

346
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,630
Where have you been, Ricki?

347
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,170
They're going to kill me.

348
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,630
- Who is? - Your lot.

349
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,630
Or their lot. Whoever gets me first.

350
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,040
I'm innocent.

351
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,420
Within reason.

352
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,430
How long have you been here?

353
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,670
Sorry, I've run out of places now.

354
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,990
I needed to see you.

355
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,460
Why?

356
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,130
There's a woman.

357
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,880
I need you to trade for her.

358
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,800
I need you to get her back off Karla.

359
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,400
A woman?

360
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,570
Her name's Irina.

361
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,180
This was last November.

362
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,870
Mr. Guillam sent me to

363
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:12,280
Istanbul to check out a Russian trade delegate

364
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,430
who might be persuaded to defect.

365
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:17,740
- Tufty Thesinger, resident. - Yeah.

366
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,170
- Hiya, Ricki. - All right, mate?

367
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,830
- Did you know him? - No, never met him.

368
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,600
Bit of a drinker.

369
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,450
Hangover from hell.

370
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,220
Bit of a fucking idiot.

371
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,020
Apparently this Russian, name of Boris,

372
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,420
was spending high and wide in the nightclubs.

373
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,200
So you were sent to persuade this Boris?

374
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,560
Yeah. He was your typical Russian.

375
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,510
Trade delegation by day, out boozing every night.

376
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,600
Didn't seem to sleep.

377
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,210
Tufty was worn out from following him around.

378
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,090
I think it's going to be a long night, son.

379
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,870
His favourite haunt was this club in Taksim.

380
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,310
It had a hellhole in the

381
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,750
basement where the sailors and the tourists went.

382
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,610
Anyway, I took one look at him and I knew I'd wasted a journey.

383
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,120
Boris was no delegate.

384
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,680
What delegate bothers to play drunker than he really is?

385
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,180
You get to recognise your own, don't you, Mr. Smiley?

386
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,560
And Boris was a hood.

387
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,560
Moscow Centre trained.

388
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,750
Someone is waiting

389
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,780
I mean just for you

390
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,130
Spinning wheel

391
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,990
Keep on spinning through, drop all your troubles...

392
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,990
I guessed he was waiting for a connect.

393
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,350
Working a letterbox, maybe.

394
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,910
Or trailing his coat and

395
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,970
looking for a pass from some mug like me.

396
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,060
So the second night I went to the import/export outfit

397
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,160
that Tufty had set up with a cipher room hidden in the back.

398
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:57,570
I cabled "No sale" to Mr. Guillam.

399
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,600
And that was that.

400
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,870
You were due to fly home the next day.

401
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,860
Yes.

402
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,810
But you didn't.

403
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,240
Boris had a wife.

404
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,060
Common-law.

405
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,130
Apparently she was a member of the delegation in her own right.

406
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,860
You once told me to trust my instincts about women, Mr. Smiley.

407
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,770
Well, my instincts told me this woman had some treasure.

408
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,700
When Boris went out for the night,

409
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,450
I found myself going into her hotel.

410
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,310
So you dropped Boris.

411
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,960
I know. It was breaking protocol.

412
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,950
But I was acting on my own initiative, as it were.

413
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,360
Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?

414
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,250
I just wanted to make sure you were all right, OK?

415
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,130
So you didn't come home?

416
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,500
I would have.

417
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,120
Boris was a dead end, but...

418
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,530
I could...

419
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,560
I could sense something in her.

420
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,210
A secret.

421
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:32,320
And how did you intend to get this secret out of her?

422
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,990
I played this businessman, Michael Trench.

423
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,010
Holiday romance.

424
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,130
I thought I'd take my time with it.

425
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,100
I know who you are.

426
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,510
I want to talk to your boss.

427
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,210
Control.

428
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,990
I have something to trade.

429
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,270
Something big.

430
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,180
I want a new life in the West.

431
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,170
That's the deal.

432
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,710
You tell them.

433
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:25,570
Look, you can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.

434
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,380
If you won't tell me more, there is nothing I can do.

435
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,540
If I tell you everything,

436
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,740
I'm putting my life in your hands.

437
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,790
And the lives of other people.

438
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,510
So she told me what she had to trade.

439
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,530
Her secret.

440
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,720
I mean,

441
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,250
the mother of all secrets.

442
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,440
I told her I'd alert the Circus.

443
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:07,950
She made me promise I

444
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,330
wouldn't give any of the details to London.

445
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,180
- And you agreed? - Yes.

446
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:15,970
I mean it was...

447
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,770
I couldn't believe I'd got hold of something this big.

448
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,840
I went back to the import/export,

449
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,240
sent the message to the Circus,

450
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,490
graded, "Flash, highest priority",

451
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,810
just that I had a Moscow-trained hood wanting to defect.

452
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:35,210
You're supposed to have gone. London stations have been on to me.

453
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,250
Want to know what the hell you're doing.

454
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,730
Fuck off.

455
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,420
Anything else, Ricki?

456
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,360
I know what I am to the Circus.

457
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,660
I'm one of the scalp-hunters,

458
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,510
someone that you can hand your dirty little jobs to.

459
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,310
I just...

460
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,650
I just wanted to bring this one in myself.

461
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,810
Well, I understand how you felt.

462
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,520
You wanted to do something.

463
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,520
I said that she claimed to have information

464
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,000
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

465
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,260
Anything more?

466
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,200
I said that she had information concerning a double agent.

467
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,190
Look, I just wanted to get the proper attention. And I'd...

468
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,760
I told them this was the reason why I had not come home.

469
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,860
It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.

470
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,820
- What did you do then? - I waited for a reply.

471
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,710
I hung around for hours. I heard the Imsak call to prayer.

472
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,250
So what's that? That's about 3.30 in the morning.

473
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,140
Then the message comes through.

474
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,950
"We read you".

475
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,270
That was all they sent. Nothing.

476
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,640
It didn't make sense. It was like they were stalling'.

477
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,250
Then what happened?

478
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,560
Then, all of a sudden...

479
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,330
the Russians begin to move.

480
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,760
It was nice work. I couldn't have done it better myself.

481
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,490
The message was quite clear. I needed to warn her.

482
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,730
Come on, come on, come on.

483
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:50,540
I've looked for everywhere.

484
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,740
I couldn't find her at the airport.

485
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,820
I even looked through all the flight lists and...

486
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,120
I headed down to the harbour.

487
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,310
They put her on a ship to Odessa.

488
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,870
That's all I know.

489
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,300
I've...

490
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,550
I've done a lot of things in my life, Mr. Smiley, but...

491
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,780
I just... I can't stop thinking about her.

492
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,070
She wasn't even my type.

493
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,740
I've got to get her out. I owe her that.

494
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,850
Karla will be looking for you.

495
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,700
Everybody's looking for me.

496
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,480
You can't stay here.

497
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:19,410
It isn't safe.

498
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,070
I said, "You may fuck me

499
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,280
but you'll call me "Sir" in the morning".

500
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,990
OK.

501
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,120
Just need to let you know.

502
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,200
Someone flew into Paris

503
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,890
last week on one of our escaped passports.

504
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:39,940
- And? - It was Ricki Tarr.

505
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,380
Why are you telling me?

506
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,900
- It could be coincidence... - You are a poisoned dwarf.

507
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,330
Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

508
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,800
and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?

509
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:57,090
Mr. Esterhase: "It could be coincidence but"...

510
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,860
Mr. Haydon interrupting.

511
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,710
"You really are a poisoned dwarf, Toby.

512
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,950
"Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

513
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,900
"and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?"

514
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,270
You look tired.

515
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,720
I didn't sleep well.

516
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:33,260
You're going to do something for me, Peter.

517
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:37,930
I need the duty officer's log book for last November.

518
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,650
I'm going to have to send you up a floor into the lions' den.

519
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,200
If you're caught,

520
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,150
you can't mention me.

521
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,130
I'm sorry, but you're alone.

522
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,590
- Last November? - Hm.

523
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,040
Mr. Guillam!

524
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:16,690
Bryant.

525
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,360
How's the family?

526
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:20,950
Fine. Need to go up to the registry today.

527
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,300
OK, sir.

528
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,290
Now you'll need a yellow one for the bag, sir.

529
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,050
Thank you.

530
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,490
Good morning, Mr. Guillam.

531
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,610
Morning, Alwyn.

532
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:59,330
- Want me to look after that for you? - Thank you.

533
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:07,020
I'll need your chit, Mr. Guillam.

534
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,350
Dolphin will kill me if I don't. New rules.

535
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,350
So, chit me.

536
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,540
Thanks.

537
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,290
- Sal, lovely surprise. - Peter.

538
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,410
- What are you up to this weekend? - Oh, you know.

539
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,410
Visiting aunts.

540
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:38,970
I'll bet.

541
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,220
Corridor D.

542
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,420
The two eights are halfway on your right.

543
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,600
The three ones are next alcove down.

544
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,260
Thanks.

545
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,410
Here's a request from Libby Barr from Bromley

546
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,500
for "Mr. Wu's A Window Cleaner Now".

547
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,880
Take it away, George.

548
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,880
Hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.

549
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,720
Can I speak to Mr. Guillam, please?

550
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,650
I'm his car mechanic.

551
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,990
Well, I'll just see if he's available. Hold on, please.

552
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,740
Mr. Wu, what shall I do?

553
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,320
- Oh, Christ! - Telephone, sir.

554
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,680
- Who is it? - Outside line, sir. Someone rough.

555
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:46,540
Sir?

556
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,630
- Hello? - Your gearbox is bust, sir.

557
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,870
Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?

558
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,250
Can't be done, sir.

559
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,560
Afraid you're gonna need a new gearbox.

560
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,300
Well, phone the main dealership first. Have you got their number?

561
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,310
No.

562
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,840
Hang on. Alwyn!

563
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:08,740
- Alwyn. - Sir?

564
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:09,780
Get me my bag, will you?

565
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,680
- But... - Just for a second.

566
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,480
Thank you.

567
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:22,460
Hang on.

568
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,030
- Hello? - I'm listening.

569
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,780
- Yes. 9-4-6-0-3-3-5. - Be right on it, sir.

570
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,830
Thank you.

571
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:51,090
Peter Guillam.

572
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,530
Could we see you, please?

573
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,250
Percy would like quite an urgent word with you.

574
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:59,050
If you can come now to the fifth floor that would be so kind.

575
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,600
Yes, of course.

576
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,100
Throw that into the lift for me.

577
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,690
Send it to the second floor, save me filling out bloody chits.

578
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:08,830
Will do, sir.

579
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:31,110
So what have you been getting up to down there these days?

580
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,830
Apart from chasing our virgins.

581
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:38,210
A couple of Arab ploys that look quite promising.

582
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,530
Apart from that, I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

583
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,150
Arabs.

584
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,570
You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right, Bill?

585
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:52,790
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

586
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,630
Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.

587
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,230
I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.

588
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,000
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

589
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,010
What's that shrug for?

590
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,100
I'm talking to you about the traitor

591
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,860
who cut the throat of our man in Istanbul.

592
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:25,320
I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section.

593
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,470
I'm accusing you of

594
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:29,300
consorting with an enemy agent behind my back.

595
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,240
Don't damn well shrug at me!

596
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,900
How would you like a term in prison?

597
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:49,290
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

598
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:53,110
So get your facts straight and get off my back!

599
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,620
So... if I told you Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

600
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,870
would you be surprised?

601
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,730
No, nothing would surprise me about Ricki Tarr.

602
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,490
And if I told you we happen to know

603
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,300
in his bank account last month,

604
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,270
would that surprise you?

605
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,580
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

606
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,390
Turned by the opposition

607
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:22,830
months ago and now they've sent him back to us.

608
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,570
- What for? - Never mind what for.

609
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:28,020
To muddy the water, that's what for.

610
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:28,990
To spread a whole lot of

611
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:32,150
damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

612
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,800
The point is this.

613
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,510
He's heading for home.

614
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:38,920
The first peep from him, you come to the grown-ups.

615
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,930
Understood?

616
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,060
Anyone you see around this table but not another damn soul.

617
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,070
Get out.

618
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,310
Peter?

619
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,330
Thank you, Belinda.

620
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,080
Oh, Mr. Wu

621
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,800
What shall I do?

622
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,620
Oh, Mr. Wu

623
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,010
What shall I do?

624
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,650
Mr. Wu...

625
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,140
All go smoothly, did it?

626
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,430
I need to go to the hotel to see George.

627
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:40,750
Mr. Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue.

628
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,510
George?

629
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,830
Mr. Guillam...

630
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,560
Sorry it took me so long to come home.

631
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,490
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

632
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,060
He's been telling us all about his adventures.

633
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,670
He's a double, George.

634
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,900
There is no mole. Whole thing's been thought up by Moscow.

635
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,580
I stole that because of you.

636
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,240
I spied on my own because of him.

637
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,440
Do you know how that makes me feel?

638
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:41,620
Ricki...

639
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,010
you said you sent the Circus

640
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,260
a telegram concerning Irina's information.

641
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,240
- That's right. - What was the date?

642
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,470
He doesn't know because there was no telegram.

643
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:52,980
- The whole thing is a fabrication. - 20th November.

644
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:56,270
It must have been 20th November. Evening.

645
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,600
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre...

646
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,350
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

647
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,510
She told me Karla...

648
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:04,520
November 20th is missing.

649
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,580
Someone is covering their tracks, unless of course you think

650
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,290
that's just a coincidence?

651
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,150
What about the money?

652
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,010
30,000 isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his mole.

653
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:26,480
I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mr. Tarr

654
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,840
and is doing everything they can to discredit him.

655
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,450
Everything the Circus thinks is gold

656
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,540
is shit, made in Moscow.

657
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,710
Why didn't you tell me that you had Tarr?

658
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,570
In case I never made it out of the Circus.

659
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,500
I should get some rest.

660
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,370
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

661
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,340
Come up.

662
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,720
I met him once.

663
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:16,330
Karla.

664
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,380
In '55.

665
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,670
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

666
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,370
Purge after purge.

667
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,140
Half their agents were jumping ship.

668
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,990
I travelled around, signing them up.

669
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,910
Hundreds of them.

670
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,380
One of them was calling himself Gerstmann.

671
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,830
He was on his way back to Russia

672
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:52,900
and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed.

673
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:57,720
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi and that's how long I had

674
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,940
to convince him to come over to us

675
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,120
instead of going home to die.

676
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,220
There's a little room.

677
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:17,030
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

678
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:25,260
The Americans had him tortured.

679
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,660
He had no fingernails.

680
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,570
It's incredibly hot.

681
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,050
I'm very tired and all I want

682
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,760
to do is get this over with and get back home.

683
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,110
Things weren't going well with Ann.

684
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,590
I give him the usual pitch.

685
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:00,880
Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life,

686
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,650
after questioning.

687
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,120
What did he say?

688
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:16,660
Think of your wife.

689
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,330
You have a wife, don't you?

690
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,160
Here. I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.

691
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,620
Use my lighter.

692
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,820
We could arrange for her to join you.

693
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:44,180
We have a lot of stock to trade.

694
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,150
If you go back, she'll be ostracised.

695
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,340
Think of her.

696
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,290
Think about...

697
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:56,960
I kept on...

698
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:01,200
...harping on about the damn wife,

699
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,760
telling him more about me than...

700
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,210
I should have walked out, of course.

701
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:14,670
But for some reason it

702
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:17,850
seemed important to save this one, so I go on.

703
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,340
We're not so very different you and I.

704
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,990
We've both spent our lives

705
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:30,620
looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems.

706
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,780
Don't you think it's time to recognise

707
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,770
there is as little worth

708
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:40,610
on your side as there is on mine?

709
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,020
Never said a word.

710
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,600
Not one word.

711
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,050
And the next morning he got back on his plane.

712
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:20,660
He handed the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched.

713
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:23,610
This was a chain-smoker, mind.

714
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,070
And he flew off to what he presumed would be his death.

715
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,390
He kept my lighter.

716
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:39,750
It was a gift.

717
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:44,220
"To George from Ann.

718
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,440
All my love.

719
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,470
That was Karla.

720
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,440
He went back to die rather than giving in.

721
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,510
Yes, and that's how I know he can be beaten.

722
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,210
Because he's a fanatic.

723
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:16,060
And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.

724
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:22,970
What did he look like?

725
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:27,030
I can't remember.

726
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,960
After today, Peter,

727
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,940
you have to assume they're watching you.

728
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:03,460
If there's anything you need tidied up,

729
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:08,880
now is the time.

730
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,910
Nearly done.

731
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,310
For God's sake.

732
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,630
Sometimes I think they're all sharing the same moronic brain.

733
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,950
If there's someone else, you can tell me.

734
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,160
I'm a grown-up.

735
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:32,990
I know. It's just going to be such a wonderful Christmas.

736
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,050
Excuse me.

737
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:48,020
And I was too proud to give in.

738
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:58,570
I had to learn the hard way.

739
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,860
- That pride...  - Peter, when you're ready,

740
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,470
put it on now.

741
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,410
Everybody!

742
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,190
- Jerry. - George.

743
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,680
- Peter. - Jerry.

744
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,080
I need to talk to you.

745
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,560
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.

746
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,360
You were duty officer, weren't you?

747
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:44,630
Yeah. Control asked me to man the phones that night.

748
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,720
He said someone was doing a special job for the service.

749
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:50,090
He wanted someone he could trust.

750
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:28,970
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

751
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:33,410
This is from the FO resident clerk.

752
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,130
A Hungarian news bulletin.

753
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,680
British spy, work name Ellis,

754
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,980
travelling with false Hungarian papers,

755
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,530
has attempted to kidnap

756
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,910
an unnamed Hungarian General in Budapest.

757
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:47,980
He's been shot.

758
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,810
Other arrests imminent.

759
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,100
Can I have a brief, please?

760
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:02,340
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

761
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,520
I must have a brief, sir.

762
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,580
I couldn't get a word out of Control.

763
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,040
So I followed protocol and went for the emergency list.

764
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,890
You rang my house.

765
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,480
Just on the off-chance you were back from Berlin.

766
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,290
What did you say?

767
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,840
- 'Hello?' - Hello, Mrs. Smiley.

768
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,320
It's Jerry. Jerry Westerby from the office.

769
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,290
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

770
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,570
Ann said you wasn't back yet and that was it.

771
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:37,800
Go on.

772
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:39,700
All hell broke loose.

773
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,150
Military yelling about Hungarian tanks on the border.

774
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:45,220
Lacon and the minister baying at the door.

775
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:48,390
Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

776
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,130
- Mr. Haydon. - Not now.

777
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:50,860
Mr. Haydon!

778
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,860
Out!

779
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,150
- Tell me. - I tried to get hold of you.

780
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:01,040
I got half a story on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.

781
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,860
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

782
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,140
Get me the Hungarian embassy.

783
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,700
You tell your masters what will happen

784
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,740
if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged.

785
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,790
Get Esterhase on the phone.

786
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,300
Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

787
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,720
Yes, sir.

788
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:33,430
Any more news on him? Sir?

789
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:39,190
Oh, God.

790
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:42,870
We need to get down to his flat, clear out anything linked.

791
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,620
Haydon heard the news at his club?

792
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,030
The Savile.

793
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:31,690
1:30? The ticker-tape wouldn't have been running.

794
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,490
So how did he know?

795
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:37,300
- Jesus, George. - Peter!

796
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,460
Jesus Christ, Bill Haydon.

797
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,030
- How could he have known? - It's not what you think.

798
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:43,580
- Then how did he know? - He was at my house that night.

799
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,300
Good flight?

800
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:19,800
Yes.

801
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,130
Pleasant enough.

802
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,890
I was just passing. I thought I'd call in.

803
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,050
Ann was in bed. She insisted on getting up.

804
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:30,670
She said she'd be down in a minute.

805
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:36,530
That's what I'm dropping off. It's an awful daub really.

806
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,290
But Ann expressed a liking.

807
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,680
What's keeping her?

808
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:03,290
Keep going.

809
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,740
Come on, lads. Keep up.

810
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:10,990
Come on, Bill!

811
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,090
- Got your specs on, Jumbo? - Yes, sir.

812
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:28,380
Come here.

813
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,280
Who's that fellow down there?

814
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,710
I don't know, sir.

815
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:42,770
Who is he?

816
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:44,970
Beggar man?

817
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:47,230
Thief?

818
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,670
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

819
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:52,740
Wouldn't you if you saw a

820
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,780
bunch of boys flogging a car round a field?

821
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,690
What's the matter with him? Doesn't he like us?

822
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,470
I don't hold with odd-bods hanging around.

823
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,840
He might steal the Alvis.

824
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,710
- Which is? - The best car in England, sir.

825
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,140
Good lad.

826
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,630
How were you briefed for the Budapest mission?

827
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,550
Control asked me to come to a flat in Kensington.

828
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,770
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

829
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:39,210
And we have to find it.

830
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,360
What did you make of it, Jim?

831
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:46,570
Control's theory?

832
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:49,790
I thought it was madness.

833
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,650
I know that it is one of five men.

834
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:01,050
All I want from you is one code name.

835
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,220
Alleline.

836
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:12,710
Tinker.

837
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:14,850
Haydon.

838
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,230
Tailor.

839
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,580
Bland.

840
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:25,380
Soldier.

841
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:30,350
We drop Sailor. It's too close to Tailor.

842
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:32,940
And Rich Man doesn't seem to be applicable.

843
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:35,790
Esterhase.

844
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,380
Poor Man.

845
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,750
And the fifth?

846
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,550
Smiley.

847
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,110
I thought it was madness.

848
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:00,540
To think that any one of you could have been a traitor.

849
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,360
Absolute madness.

850
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:08,630
But you still went.

851
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:10,620
Why?

852
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,850
I went because Control asked me to go.

853
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,120
It's called doing one's duty.

854
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,320
At the station I met the legman

855
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,920
supposed to take me to the General.

856
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,600
The waiter must have panicked.

857
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,960
It was meant to be a simple snatch job.

858
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,820
They drove me to some military hospital,

859
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:49,240
and then put me on a transport plane.

860
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,630
I could tell by the stars we were heading east.

861
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,680
Then they worked me for...

862
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:02,620
I don't know how long.

863
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:07,010
Weeks, maybe months.

864
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:48,240
What did you tell them?

865
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:50,930
Everything.

866
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,600
I held on for as long as I could

867
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,020
to let everyone get the hell out of there.

868
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,030
Did they?

869
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,950
My networks in Hungary,

870
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:04,960
did they get out?

871
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:09,930
No, they were blown.

872
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:16,140
The story is you blew them to save your own skin.

873
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:25,780
After the interrogators had cleared out,

874
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,930
this little fellow turned up.

875
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,070
Looked like a priest.

876
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:36,520
That's when they really started on me.

877
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,480
What was your last line of defence?

878
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:42,850
The mole.

879
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:47,020
Control's crazy theory.

880
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,480
I was going to bury that so deep

881
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,760
they'd never get it out of me.

882
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:57,840
- Which was a joke. - Why?

883
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:00,640
Because they already knew.

884
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,900
All they wanted to know was

885
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:05,460
how far Control had got in his investigation.

886
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:22,340
No, I don't know her.

887
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:45,570
Did they ask about me at all?

888
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,420
Yes.

889
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:50,360
The little fellow did.

890
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,960
What did he say about me?

891
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,470
He had this cigarette lighter.

892
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,760
He kept flashing it about for me to see it.

893
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:06,940
Showed me the inscription.

894
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,560
To George From Ann.

895
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,530
"All my love".

896
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:20,060
Karla.

897
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:52,400
It was odd.

898
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:56,490
They sent me back to England.

899
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:59,840
Straight to Sarratt for debriefing'.

900
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:05,880
He said when he was being debriefed at the nursery,

901
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,430
he had a visitor.

902
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,170
Who?

903
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,610
Toby Esterhase.

904
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:15,360
He gave him 1,000 pound and an Alvis.

905
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,830
Told him he was dead now.

906
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:19,080
Couldn't come back.

907
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,390
Had to become a lotus eater,

908
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:23,150
forget everything that happened.

909
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:24,770
Control's theory.

910
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,550
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.

911
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:30,680
Yes, that's what I thought.

912
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:36,200
How on earth did Esterhase hear about Tinker, Tailor?

913
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,780
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

914
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:57,580
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

915
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,320
She told me Karla was very proud of this.

916
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,670
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold

917
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:04,370
is shit, made in Moscow.

918
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,010
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

919
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:14,960
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

920
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,720
No, I had a hotel nearby.

921
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:18,730
They do have some seedy rooms.

922
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:20,560
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

923
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,140
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

924
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,860
She told me Karla was very proud of this.

925
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:05,230
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit.

926
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,250
This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear?

927
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:41,260
Perfectly, Minister.

928
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:51,210
There is a house somewhere in this city

929
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,290
where Alleline and the others

930
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:56,760
meet Witchcraft's London representative.

931
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,790
I thought Lacon had made it clear to you.

932
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:01,850
Keep your nose bloody well out of Witchcraft's business.

933
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:04,230
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

934
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:07,010
You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.

935
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:09,520
I wouldn't consider that sound advice,

936
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,040
given the mess Control left us with.

937
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:16,610
It has taken Alleline and, if I may say so, myself

938
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,490
this long to get us back in the game.

939
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:24,340
The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov.

940
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,220
You believe his role is to bring information

941
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,420
from Witchcraft to you.

942
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:36,510
His real role is to receive information from the mole

943
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:38,280
to take back to Karla.

944
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:43,140
That, er... That's not possible.

945
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:44,780
Made possible.

946
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,830
By you in the house you persuaded the Treasury to pay for.

947
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:54,940
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine. It's been gold.

948
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:58,790
It's just enough glitter amongst the chicken feed.

949
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:02,320
Control didn't believe in miracles or in Witchcraft.

950
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,900
But you were lazy and greedy

951
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:05,770
and so you hounded him out of the Circus

952
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:08,560
and you let Karla in.

953
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,460
You opened negotiations

954
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,330
to exchange intelligence with the Americans.

955
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:17,910
What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin.

956
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:23,540
Witchcraft's information, the "Gold" Karla let you have,

957
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,160
it wasn't to lure you.

958
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,470
It was to lure the Americans.

959
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:32,170
Now,

960
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:35,540
do you want to take credit for that?

961
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,960
What can we do?

962
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:47,650
We have one thing the mole wants.

963
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,800
- If I go to Paris - You'll go.

964
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,620
If I go to Paris,

965
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:59,930
I want your word that you will get Irina back.

966
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,940
I don't care who you have to trade.

967
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:04,830
And I am out.

968
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,800
I want a family, thank you.

969
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,590
I do not want to end up like you lot.

970
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:14,510
You will get her back.

971
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,000
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

972
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,870
Oh, hello, George.

973
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:48,450
Hello.

974
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:17,440
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

975
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:22,520
Control recruited you, didn't he?

976
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:26,140
Found you starving in a museum in Vienna.

977
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:28,030
A wanted man.

978
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:31,340
Saved your life, I heard.

979
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:34,570
And yet when the time came,

980
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:37,100
when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline,

981
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,790
you didn't hesitate.

982
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:41,610
That's understandable, perhaps,

983
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,630
with your war experience.

984
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:45,800
You survived this long, I suppose,

985
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:48,680
because of your ability to change sides.

986
01:40:48,910 --> 01:40:50,940
Serve any master.

987
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:59,750
What? What's... What's this about, George?

988
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:04,040
It's about which master you've been serving, Toby.

989
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:10,280
Intelligence has been leaked, Toby.

990
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,480
Someone's been taking files from the Circus.

991
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,260
No, no, no, no. No.

992
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:17,610
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.

993
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:21,250
Files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?

994
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:23,110
Yes.

995
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,210
And, yes, I delivered them.

996
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:35,030
But so did Percy Alleline.

997
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,030
Good boy.

998
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,260
Bill Haydon.

999
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,290
And so did Roy Bland.

1000
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:59,310
Things aren't always what they seem, George.

1001
01:41:59,310 --> 01:42:01,210
You should know that.

1002
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:04,510
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...

1003
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,550
...working for them.

1004
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:12,950
Every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them.

1005
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:15,550
Chicken feed, just to keep his bosses happy.

1006
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:20,870
But Polyakov's our Joe.

1007
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:22,980
He's a part of a big operation.

1008
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:25,330
Operation Witchcraft.

1009
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:27,300
Yes, I know.

1010
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:29,470
George.

1011
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,570
- Please, I don't deserve this. - Who gave you the message

1012
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:35,850
for Jim Prideaux to forget about Tinker, Tailor?

1013
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:38,330
- Bland. - To get rid of Connie Sachs?

1014
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:40,340
- Westerby? - Bland.

1015
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:41,840
Or Haydon.

1016
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:44,690
I don't know. One of them.

1017
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:47,500
Or maybe Percy. No.

1018
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:49,450
Well, I don't know who.

1019
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,030
You're just the messenger.

1020
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:55,660
Running between them all.

1021
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,350
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

1022
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:03,030
I know all about your secret source.

1023
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:06,580
And I know something you don't.

1024
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,180
I know who he is.

1025
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:14,550
He's Karla.

1026
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:27,160
One of you has been giving Polyakov the crown jewels.

1027
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:30,510
- I did not know. - Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

1028
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:32,640
Look, George, I didn't know.

1029
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:35,010
You picked the wrong side.

1030
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:36,590
No, you've got to believe me.

1031
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:39,070
George, please.

1032
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,240
I am loyal.

1033
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:48,970
I... I am loyal.

1034
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,760
Don't... Don't... Don't send me back.

1035
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:04,270
Please, George.

1036
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:06,800
Don't send me back.

1037
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,050
Give me the address.

1038
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,490
Where do you meet Polyakov?

1039
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:36,270
Hey, hey! Dog, dog, be quiet!

1040
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:39,570
What is this? Who are you?

1041
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:41,860
- Mrs. McCraig? - Yes.

1042
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:59,820
- What are the safety signals? - The air vent.

1043
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:00,870
Open and all's well,

1044
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:02,660
closed and you're not to enter.

1045
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:07,150
And the microphone?

1046
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,150
Peter?

1047
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,580
The boy stood on the burning deck

1048
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:36,090
whence all but he had fled

1049
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:37,410
The flame that lit the battle's wreck

1050
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:39,220
shone brightly o'er the dead.

1051
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:41,220
Beautiful and proud he stood

1052
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,990
as born to rule the storm

1053
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:44,440
A creature of heroic blood,

1054
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:46,710
a proud though child-like form.

1055
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:47,380
The flames rolled on...

1056
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:49,450
he would not go. Without his father's word

1057
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,170
Merci. Au revoir.

1058
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,380
Go on.

1059
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:48,350
The whole service is looking for you, Ricki.

1060
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:49,930
They'll skin you alive if they find you.

1061
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:51,500
Maybe I want them to find me.

1062
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:54,280
You can go now.

1063
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,370
Leave the books where they are

1064
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:56,600
and put the keys in the machines.

1065
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,130
No, Ben stays here.

1066
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,100
Ricki Tarr claims to have

1067
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:04,720
information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

1068
01:47:26,910 --> 01:47:28,230
Mr. Smiley?

1069
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,470
Taxi approaching Circus.

1070
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:46,200
Tinker.

1071
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:58,980
Tailor.

1072
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:06,090
Here comes Soldier.

1073
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:12,410
Full house.

1074
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,760
Well, go on then. Read it out loud.

1075
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:31,800
Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

1076
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:37,550
Require clarification before meeting your request.

1077
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:40,370
Quote, information vital

1078
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:44,300
to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote.

1079
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:49,820
Does not qualify, send further information.

1080
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:52,590
Ah! That's it, Percy, you keep stalling.

1081
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,430
I warn you, Ben.

1082
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,510
We've got some really lousy people in this outfit.

1083
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:57,670
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

1084
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,160
The meeting's over.

1085
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:11,810
They're leaving.

1086
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:16,070
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

1087
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,980
I keep thinking how much

1088
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:21,100
I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.

1089
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:29,000
I was rather hoping you

1090
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,870
might do a little light housekeeping for me.

1091
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,780
If I can.

1092
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:38,130
There's a girl.

1093
01:53:39,290 --> 01:53:40,900
Give her some money, would you?

1094
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:43,780
And give her a good cover story.

1095
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,050
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1096
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:50,090
It's all there.

1097
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:52,560
And there's a boy, too.

1098
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:54,610
Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1099
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:59,260
I know the inquisitors' bag of tricks.

1100
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,870
I taught most of them.

1101
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:05,300
It's just a reaction.

1102
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,860
An over-reaction, if you like.

1103
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:13,530
I did have one or two questions.

1104
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:18,610
- About Prideaux. - Goddamn it!

1105
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:21,800
- I got him back, didn't I? - Yes, yes, you did.

1106
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,620
That was good of you.

1107
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:28,230
I am surprised Karla didn't have him shot.

1108
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:31,780
Or do you think he held back,

1109
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,050
out of delicacy towards you?

1110
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:40,570
Did Prideaux come and see you

1111
01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:43,320
before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1112
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:48,360
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1113
01:54:51,390 --> 01:54:52,760
To say what?

1114
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,440
To warn you.

1115
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,580
Because he knew deep down

1116
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:08,170
it was you all along.

1117
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:14,230
So did you.

1118
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:21,650
I had to pick a side, George.

1119
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:26,090
It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one.

1120
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:31,200
And the West has become so very ugly.

1121
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,330
Don't you think?

1122
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:38,750
Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?

1123
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,280
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1124
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,470
What are you, then, Bill?

1125
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,940
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1126
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:09,020
Is there anything particular

1127
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:11,330
you want me to pass on to Ann?

1128
01:56:15,310 --> 01:56:16,800
Oh, that was nothing personal, George.

1129
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:18,450
I hope you understand that.

1130
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:21,810
Karla said you were good,

1131
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:24,020
the one we had to worry about.

1132
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:27,600
But you do have a blind spot.

1133
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,920
He reckoned if I was known to be Ann's lover,

1134
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,410
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

1135
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:38,920
And he was right.

1136
01:56:41,030 --> 01:56:42,320
Up to a point.

1137
01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:47,780
Up to a point.

1138
01:57:15,490 --> 01:57:17,230
I made this for you, sir.

1139
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:28,560
I don't want you hanging around here any more.

1140
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:32,930
Keep away from me from now on.

1141
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:37,680
- Go and join the others. - But...

1142
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:40,840
Just... just bloody join in, will you?

1143
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:46,780
Go and play, damn you!

1144
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:06,450
Could you check, Jerry?
