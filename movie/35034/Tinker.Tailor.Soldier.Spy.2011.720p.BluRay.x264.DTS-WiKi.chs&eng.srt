2
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,066
没被跟踪吧？
You weren't followed?

3
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,449
没
No.

4
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,402
快请进
Better come in.

5
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,620
吉姆，谁都别信
Trust no one, Jim.

6
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,793
尤其是那些要人
Especially not in the mainstream.

7
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:33,760
请坐
Sit down.

8
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:51,153
我知道你仍有一个匈牙利身份可用
I understand you still have one Hungarian identity running?

9
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,817
是的
I do.

10
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,366
我想派你去布达佩斯（匈牙利首都）
I want you to go to Budapest.

11
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:07,423
秘密行动
This is not above board.

12
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,588
他人不知
Nobody else knows.

13
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:13,667
他们可是巴不得我失手呢，吉姆小子
They're after my head, Jim boy.

14
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,090
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

15
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,827
我听小道消息说
I have had an offer of service.

16
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:49,462
一位匈牙利将军要来访
A Hungarian general wants to come over.

17
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,966
我想让你会会他
I would like you to meet him.

18
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:59,342
他有我要的情报，吉姆
He has some information that I need, Jim.

19
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:03,514
什么情报？
What information?

20
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,979
重要机密
Treasure.

21
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,693
他知道“鼹鼠”的名字…
He has the name of the mole,

22
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:16,490
一个俄国佬在英国情报部门安插的内鬼…
the Russians have planted in the British intelligence service

23
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,539
就在“马戏团”的高层中
(“马戏团”即Cambridge Circus,当时英国情报部门的驻地，
下文提到的“局子”也指此）
right at the top of the Circus.

24
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:28,294
有个内鬼，吉姆
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

25
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:30,500
我们得把他挖出来
We have to find it.

26
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,590
来点匈牙利炖肉吧，你尝过吧？

27
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:39,391
是的，我尝过

28
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:43,875
味道很棒，比土豆牛肉汤强多了，但你现在在布达佩斯吃不到

29
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,335
为什么？

30
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:48,880
所有的猪都到莫斯科去了

31
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:31,946
我什么时候能见上你的朋友？

32
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:34,761
我会带你去见他的，不吃点么？

33
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:14,073
容我失陪一会？

34
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,584
站住！
Stop!

35
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,022
别开枪！

36
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:31,279
谁让你开枪的？谁他妈让你开枪的？

37
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:39,835
该死的业余脑残匈牙利杀手！我要留活口！

38
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:43,957
看看你都干了些什么，脑残！

39
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:52,456
骚动什么？都站在原地

40
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:55,225
我要留活口！

41
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:23,423
英国秘密情报局首领

43
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,646
帮我做个见证吧？
Would you witness this for me?

44
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,480
我真希望我当时能多帮点忙，老总。
I wish I could done more, Control.

45
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,151
你已经尽力了，珀西
You did all you could, Percy.

46
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,989
作为男人，须知何时谢幕离场
Well, a man should know when to leave the party.

47
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,334
史迈利呢？
What about Smiley?

48
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,670
史迈利随我一起退休
Smiley is leaving with me.

49
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:26,233
你个小变态，伊斯特哈斯
You little prick, Esterhase.

00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:05,641
片名：锅匠 裁缝 士兵 间谍

51
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,176
先生们，我们开始吧？
Gentlemen, shall we start?

52
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,957
安·史迈利夫人
艾瑟顿大街18号
伊斯林顿区
伦敦

53
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,085
珀西先生，副局长拉康在等您
Under Secretary Lacon is ready for you, Sir Percy.

54
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:00,629
财政部不解
The Treasury don't understand.

55
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:03,965
情报部门为何不为经费增加的问题
Why can't the intelligence service simply put in a request

56
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:05,674
提交一个正式的申请呢
for a general increase in funding

57
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,725
那样不就可以支撑你们的专项行动了吗？
and then you account for the spend on your special operation?

58
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:12,605
“巫术行动”需要保密
Operation Witchcraft needs to remain secret.

59
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:15,687
- 所以开支由他们自由控制
- 这也是困扰我们的原因
- It's a fiefdom of its own.  - Yes, that's what's worrying us.

60
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:18,440
整件事难以解释，不是吗？
The whole thing's very unaccountable, isn't it?

61
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:23,779
没人知道这间伦敦宅子在哪儿
And this London house that nobody knows the address of,

62
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,535
有这个必要吗？
is that really necessary?

63
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:29,032
比起从前，现在更需要保护
我们苏联情报的来源渠道
Now more than ever. We need to protect our Soviet source.

64
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,868
那你认为我们该在哪接头？咖啡馆？
So where do you propose we meet? In a caf?

65
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:35,707
房租和费率都翻了倍
The rent and rates on this house have doubled.

66
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,967
我们在核弹头上花了数百万
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

67
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:42,965
却不能为一间房子申请几千块
We're asking for a few thousand for a house.

68
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:45,055
真想知道卡拉是不是也面对着
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

69
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:46,926
一样抠门的苏联财政部和克林姆林宫
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

70
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,555
听着，没人低估
Look, nobody underestimates

71
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:51,307
你们工作的重要性
the importance of the job you chaps are doing.

72
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,728
可去年在布达佩斯发生的事
But what happened in Budapest last year,

73
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:57,604
着实让人心有余悸
that was a disaster.

74
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,648
恕我直言，先生
With respect, sir,

75
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:02,819
牺牲的不是您的手下，对吧？
it wasn't one of your civil servants that got killed, was it?

76
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:05,359
军人在战壕里奋战的时代虽然已经过去
Now this isn't about soldiers in trenches any more.

77
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,785
- 可我们现在干的和在前线无异…
- 罗伊！
- We're the front line now...  - Roy!

78
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,250
过去的25年里，只有我们在阻止卡拉
For 25 years we've been the only thing 

79
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,260
standing between them and Karla

80
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,661
莫斯科，以及该死的第三次世界大战
and Moscow and the third bloody world war.

81
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:18,965
听着，部长大人对你们目前工作的进展表示满意
Look, the Minister's very pleased with your progress so far.

82
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:22,797
但是他对你们和我们亲爱的美国表亲之间
He's less pleased, though,

83
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:25,504
缺少协作这点不甚满意
with the lack of progress with our American cousins.

84
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,597
你知道
You see,

85
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,805
在他们眼中
in their eyes,

86
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,347
你们还是一艘漏洞百出的破船
you're still a leaky ship.

87
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:52,576
什么事？
Yes?

88
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:55,749
有人找您，先生，好像很急
Someone on the line for you, sir. Seems urgent. 

89
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:57,626
好的，接通吧
All right, well put him through.

90
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:02,837
- 你好？
- 是副局长拉康吗？
- Hello?  - Is this Under Secretary Lacon? 

91
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:04,301
正是
Yes.

92
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:06,640
我叫里基•塔尔
My name's Ricki Tarr.

93
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:10,143
- 有事吗？
- 我想见您
- What do you want?  - I need to meet you.

94
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:12,730
如果您要核实我的身份，可以找我“马戏团”的上司
If you need to confirm who I am, 

95
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

96
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:16,646
彼得•吉勒姆
Peter Guillam.

97
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:19,401
只有他知道我
But only Guillam, no one else.

98
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:35,548
允许你骑车进来吗？
You got clearance for that?

99
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:38,545
我才不会傻得把它锁在外面呢
Well, I'm not bloody chaining it up outside.

100
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:39,698
友情提醒，和里面这些狠角儿放一起相对安全
Mind you, no better off in here 

101
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,308
with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

102
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:44,005
他们连你嘴里的消息都挖的出来
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

103
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,638
我得赶在布兰德之前看一眼新来的妹子
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse of the new girl 

104
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:47,648
before Bland gets to her.

105
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:51,146
是啊，金发女郎贝琳达
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

106
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,314
- 他见过她没？
- 肯定见过
- Has he seen her yet?  - Of course he has.

107
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:55,152
今早第一件事就是看她
Came down first thing this morning.

108
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,988
贝琳达
Belinda.

109
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:10,036
- 我是彼得•吉勒姆
- 你好啊，彼得，我是奥利弗
- Peter Guillam.  - Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

110
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,744
想问问你…
Just ringing to find out...

111
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:16,331
这么说是温斯顿•丘吉尔救了你一命，伊迪
So Winston Churchill saved your life, Edie.

112
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:19,137
当时我在厨房备好了晚餐
I was working in the kitchen, getting dinner ready.

113
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:20,970
他迟到了
And he was late, you see.

114
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,471
- 突袭的时候？
- 是的
- During a raid?  - During a raid, you see.

115
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,428
他问，你为什么不在那个避难所？
He said, "Why aren't you in that shelter?"

116
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:27,104
- 你不也不在么？
- 因为我…
- Why weren't you?  - Well, because... 

117
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:40,698
很遗憾听到老总的死讯，史迈利先生
I was sorry to hear about Control, Mr Smiley.

118
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:55,966
他说塔尔在电话亭给他致电
He said Tarr called him from a phone box.

119
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:07,806
他说有“鼹鼠”
He said there's a mole,

120
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,264
就在“马戏团”的高层里
right at the top of the Circus,

121
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:16,018
已潜伏多年
that he's been there for years.

122
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,380
那就是说
It does mean

123
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:41,429
你最好给我们立即查清楚原委
you're rather well placed to look into this matter for us now,

124
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,633
是不？
doesn't it?

125
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,429
把他清除出去
Outside the family.

126
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:58,021
我已经退休了，奥利弗
I'm retired, Oliver.

127
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:00,316
你解雇了我
You fired me.

128
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:02,326
实际上
The thing is,

129
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:04,412
老总死前
some time ago before Control died,

130
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,079
曾来找我，暗示我说
he came to me with a similar suggestion.

131
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,495
有“鼹鼠”
That there is a mole.

132
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,750
他没对你讲过他的怀疑么？
He never mentioned his suspicions to you?

133
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,211
没有
No.

134
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,932
噢，我以为你是他的心腹，会跟你讲…
Oh, I just thought that as you were his man, so to speak...

135
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,431
你怎么跟他说的？
What did you say to him?

136
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:28,313
我想恐怕是他的妄想症在作祟
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had rather gotten the better of him

137
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,440
再这样下去就要自毁长城了
and he was going to pull his whole house down.

138
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,645
还有布达佩斯的惨剧
That bloody mess in Budapest.

139
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,067
不可否认，乔治
Damn it, George.

140
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,241
他们可是你孕育的一代，是你留下的财富
It's your generation, your legacy.

141
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,180
我本以为，要是这事儿听来有几分可信，
你会愿意…
I would have thought, if there's any truth in it, 

142
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,990
you'd want to...

143
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:20,117
我要彼得
I'll keep Peter.

144
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:24,871
还有一个政治保安处退下来的人，孟德尔
And there's a retired Special Branch man, Mendel.

145
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,119
我要他
I should like to have him.

146
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,582
提起来
Lift up.

147
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,548
再赶紧关好
And quickly down again.

148
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,004
先生，我知道一个利物浦大街附近的小旅馆
There's a place I know, sir. 

149
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:46,014
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

150
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,226
请小心点，乔治王时代的
Be careful with it. Please. It's Georgian.

151
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:28,138
我朋友想要安静工作，波普·格雷姆夫人
My friend wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope Graham.

152
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,390
不要打搅他
No disturbances.

153
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:32,851
她真名只是格雷姆
Her real name is just Graham.

154
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:35,111
加上波普（“教皇”的谐音）以示高贵
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

155
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,924
彼得，你有老总住处的钥匙吗？
Peter, did you get the keys to Control's flat? 

156
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:05,629
# And did those feet in ancient time #

157
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,008
# Walk upon England's mountains green #

158
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:13,854
噢！
Oh!

159
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:43,157
乔治！
George! 

160
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,669
乔治快来
George, get in here!

161
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,918
乔治
George.

162
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,672
坐下
Sit down.

163
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:04,137
看看这些胡言乱语
Take a look at this nonsense.

164
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,691
苏联最高指挥部的
Report by Soviet high command

165
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,689
关于他们近期于黑海的海军演练的报告
on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea.

166
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:17,447
正是海军部求咱们
Just what the admiralty has been begging us
 142

167
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:19,286
弄的情报
for some information on.

168
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:22,658
- 哪儿得到的？
- 不是我
- Where did you get this?  - I didn't.

169
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:24,702
珀西和他的小党羽搞到的
Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.

170
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,914
- 听着，老总…
- 闭嘴
- Look, Control...  - Shut up.

171
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:30,044
文风假得令人无语
Style appalling.

172
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,177
明显从头到尾都是伪造的
Patently a fabrication from beginning to end.

173
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:34,953
- 也有可能是真的
- 如果是真的，那可价值连城
Just could be the real thing. 

174
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:37,363
Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

175
00:23:38,435 --> 00:23:41,270
不过它到手太快了，令人生疑
But its topicality makes it suspect.

176
00:23:41,397 --> 00:23:44,681
史迈利怀疑你了呢，珀西
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

177
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:47,651
哪儿来的？什么渠道？
Where did it come from? What's the access?

178
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:49,818
我的一个新的秘密线人
A new secret source of mine.

179
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:51,607
他怎么可能得到这个的？
But how could he possibly have access?

180
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:54,908
他能参与甚至最机密层级的政策制定
He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy-making.

181
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:58,410
我们命名这个行动为“巫术”
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

182
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,456
珀西和他的伙计们真是深谙越俎代庖之术啊，史迈利
Oh, Percy and his pals bypassed us, Smiley.

183
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,790
僭越了我们直接找部长去了
Gone straight to the minister.

184
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,167
珀西那位新朋友，连身份都被
Percy has been allowed to keep the identity of his new friend

185
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,758
钦点为最高机密了呢
top secret.

186
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:13,466
部长也认同这里太多的机密被泄露了
The minister agrees too many secrets are blown around here.

187
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:15,505
不胜枚举的失败，接连不断的丑闻
Too much failure, too many scandals.

188
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,102
-有用的情报少得可怜
- 珀西有他的道理，老总
Too little solid intelligence. 

189
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:18,912
Percy does have a point, Control.

190
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:21,772
我们应该反共，而不是内讧
We should be fighting Communism, not each other.

191
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:24,603
与此同时，我们信誉扫地，损兵折将
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners.

192
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,013
你们该死的美国佬！
Your bloody Yanks!

193
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:28,559
我们受够了！得改革了
We've had enough! There's going to be changes.

194
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:30,412
是时候决定是固步自封还是开创未来了
We need to decide if want to be part of the past 

195
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:32,422
or part of the future.

196
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:35,737
当年我就不该把你带来
I should have left you where I found you.

197
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,910
- 听着！
- 老总…
- Look!  - Control...

198
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,783
滚，都给我滚出去！
Out, all of you!

199
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,898
如果“巫术”是真的…
If Witchcraft is genuine...

200
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:08,316
没有什么是真的
Nothing is genuine any more.

201
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,667
乔治…
George...

202
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,716
要我把这些东西带到旅馆吗？
Do you want me to get this stuff over to the hotel?

203
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:57,075
谢谢，随便放
Thank you. Er, anywhere will do.

204
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,416
- 彼得？
- 嗯？
- Peter?  - Hm?

205
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:02,916
我要你替我办点事
I need you to do something for me.

206
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:12,545
[卡拉]

207
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:14,513
你去“马戏团”
I'd lik e you to go to the Circus.

208
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:20,229
在值班岗那儿的橱柜里
In the cabinet at the duty officers' station

209
00:26:20,356 --> 00:26:22,596
有最近退休人员的记录
are records of staff recently retired.

210
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:27,728
拍成照片给我
I'd like photographs of them

211
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:32,241
还有珀西•阿勒莱恩管理的
“马戏团”发生变动的图表
and of the diagram of the Circus's reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

212
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:37,074
和所有行动基金的支付清单
along with a list of all payments made from the Reptile fund.

213
00:26:54,957 --> 00:26:58,456
在艾伯特大厅的拐角有一家咖啡厅

214
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:00,957
是的，三点四十五

215
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:02,957
不，我没时间弄那个

216
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:04,356
我知道...

217
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,156
我知道它长什么样

218
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:10,610
- 比尔，什么事？
- 我在找“陛下”（指珀西）
Help you with anything, Bill?  

219
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,420
I was just looking for his Majesty.

220
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,779
他到天台散步去了
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

221
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,757
非常感谢

222
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:20,035
哦
Oh.

223
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,364
- 听说你受伤了，彼得？
- 开抽屉的时候夹了手
Heard you had an accident, Peter.  

224
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,174
Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

225
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,083
你什么时候去置办些新家具？
When are you going to get some new furniture up here?

226
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:06,378
我会跟伊斯特哈斯说的，要把这作为决策层的首要大事
I'll have a word with Esterhase.

227
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,388
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.

228
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:12,012
- 你去哪儿？
- 吃午饭
- Where are you off to?  - Lunch.

229
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,219
一起？
Want some company?

230
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:19,309
根据人事档案
According to the personnel files,

231
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:21,063
有七个到了退休年龄
seven were due for retirement anyway.

232
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,398
其他四个也没有太明显的疑点
Another four don't seem particularly mysterious.

233
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:26,528
杰瑞•韦斯特比于12月4日被解雇
Jerry Westerby was dismissed December 4.

234
00:28:27,698 --> 00:28:29,573
康妮•萨克斯于11月28日退休
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

235
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:32,866
那是在你和老总被挤走后的两周里发生的
That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.

236
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:45,300
- 回牛津
- 1点15的车
- Return to Oxford, please.  - That's 1.15.

237
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:06,863
珀西向来反对
Percy has always resisted any proposal

238
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,774
广泛利用“巫术”情报的提议
of a wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.

239
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:12,786
别来跟我玩文绉绉的官腔，拉康
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

240
00:29:12,914 --> 00:29:15,747
我至今未跟同盟们分享过“巫术”，部长大人
I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies so far, Minister.

241
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,959
吝啬的家伙
Greedy boy.

242
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:22,536
我是想建立一套密不透风的巫术行动情报档案
My goal has been to establish its track record beyond all doubt.

243
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:30,466
我觉得是时候携手我们的美国盟友了
I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in-arms.

244
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:34,967
- 他们会对我们重燃欲火么？
- 我不要一次性交易
Will they take us back into bed?  

245
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:36,977
I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

246
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:41,685
我要长期的美国情报的分享权
I want on-going access to American intelligence.

247
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,397
你觉得我们能得到吗？
You think we can get it?

248
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,181
只要有“巫术”，我们可以得到任何想要的
With Witchcraft on our side, 

249
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:47,191
we can get anything we bloody well want.

250
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:53,080
好吧
Fine.

251
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,155
继续下去
Carry on.

252
00:29:58,461 --> 00:29:59,918
谢谢
Thank you.

253
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,970
我要打败你…
And I strike thee down...

254
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,786
哦，我…
Oh, I, er...

255
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,838
想都别想，医生有吩咐
Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.

256
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,508
坏坏的乔治
Wicked, wicked George.

257
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,498
我不知道你怎么想的，乔治
I don't know about you, George,

258
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,164
但我觉得我严重地缺少性爱
but I f eel seriously under-fucked.

259
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:25,173
我听说安又弃你而去了
I heard Ann left you again.

260
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:31,006
她配不上你，乔治，连你一根头发都配不上
She doesn't deserve you, George, not one hair on your head.

261
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:35,436
我退休不久，你也离开了“马戏团”
You left the Circus shortly after I retired.

262
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:40,060
我是被开除的
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

263
00:31:40,194 --> 00:31:44,025
被开除的垃圾，和你一样
Chucked out on the rubbish heap, like you.

264
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:45,186
为什么？
Why?

265
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:51,783
波利亚科夫
Polyakov.

266
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:54,790
还记得他吗？
Do you remember him?

267
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,118
苏联大使馆的那位？
From the Soviet Embassy?

268
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:02,204
阿联克斯•波利亚科夫，以文化交流为由常驻伦敦
Alexsey Polyakov, cultural attache here in London.

269
00:32:03,426 --> 00:32:07,639
15年前他来到这里，我要求对其清查
When he arrived here 15 years ago, I requested he be checked out.

270
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:12,472
可他记录清白，为人谨慎
He was graded whiter than white. Didn't put a foot wrong.

271
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,679
但你不这么认为？
But you disagreed?

272
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:17,606
你肯定听闻过这个传说
There's a story you must have heard

273
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:20,687
卡拉设立了个秘密单元
that Karla has set up a secret cell.

274
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:22,777
所有成员都是以前军人
The personnel are all ex-military,

275
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:26,984
训练有素地掌控着资深间谍和“鼹鼠”们
trained to handle deep-penetration agents, moles.

276
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:29,904
传说是不绝于耳的，康妮
There are always stories, Connie.

277
00:32:30,037 --> 00:32:32,575
万一这个传说是真的呢？
But what if this story was true?

278
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:38,327
有一晚在调查中我发现了些东西，乔治
One night in research I saw something, George.

279
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:41,962
我们的朋友波利亚科夫在柏林五一大阅兵中
There was our friend Polyakov at a May day parade in Berlin

280
00:32:42,091 --> 00:32:44,666
收到了一个军礼
receiving a salute.

281
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:47,591
为什么要向一个文化专员敬礼？
Why would you salute a cultural attache?

282
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:51,425
显然，除非他是个退伍军人
Exactly. Unless he was a war veteran himself.

283
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:55,309
若真如此，为何要隐瞒真相？
And if he was, why hide the fact?

284
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,063
你怎么做的？
What did you do?

285
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,812
我直接去找托比•伊斯特哈斯和珀西•阿勒莱恩
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

286
00:33:00,903 --> 00:33:03,145
看
Here.

287
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,651
如果我没弄错的话，波利亚科夫是卡拉训练的人
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood if ever I saw one.

288
00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:08,907
他若在这儿，说明卡拉安插了“鼹鼠”于此
If he's here, it must be because he's running a mole.

289
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:11,112
你不要管波利亚科夫
You're to leave Polyakov alone.

290
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:13,371
你太纠缠他了
You're becoming obsessed with him.

291
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:19,547
- 不要越俎代庖
- 太荒唐了
- You're losing your sense of proportion, Connie.  - But that's ridiculous.

292
00:33:19,674 --> 00:33:22,792
也许是时候让你回到现实的世界了
Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world.

293
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:31,032
阿列克斯·波利亚科夫

294
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,311
走就走，反正从前的“马戏团”已经逝去了
What does it matter? Old Circus is gone anyway.

295
00:33:56,086 --> 00:33:58,127
看看这些
Here we are.

296
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:00,332
我们那时的日子
The nursery in our day.

297
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,427
吉姆•普里多
Jim Prideaux.

298
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:08,137
当然还有比尔•海顿
俩人黏在一块，和往常一样
And Bill Haydon. Together, of course.

299
00:34:08,974 --> 00:34:10,634
“形影不离的一对”
The Inseparables.

300
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:15,937
还有老总的独照
There's Control himself.

301
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:18,728
我的男孩们
All my boys.

302
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:22,817
我的好战友
All my lovely boys.

303
00:34:25,618 --> 00:34:27,860
那时候多美好啊，乔治
That was a good time, George.

304
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:31,496
可那是战争年代啊，康妮
It was the war, Connie.

305
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:36,702
那是一场真正的战争
A real war.

306
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:38,996
至少那时候英国人还有自豪的理由
Englishmen could be proud then.

307
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,053
我还是对的，是吧？
So I was right, then?

308
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:51,508
至少关于波利亚科夫
About Polyakov.

309
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:53,472
确有“鼹鼠”
There is a mole.

310
00:34:57,442 --> 00:35:02,569
若真如此，请勿回来
我想把记忆定格在你们都美好的时候
If it's bad, don't come back. I want to remember you all as you were.

311
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:12,119
珀西？珀西，你调的这汤？
Percy? Percy, did you mix this?

312
00:35:13,252 --> 00:35:15,127
是，是我调的
Aye, I did so.

313
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:18,918
你这个小气的没救的苏格兰人
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

314
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:22,215
你这种外行就不能按食谱来做吗？
Can you learn to take a bloody order?

315
00:35:22,343 --> 00:35:25,463
谁也不能乱改食谱！
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

316
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:27,389
- 我就是按着食谱来的啊
- 别说了
- I followed the recipe.  - Come on.

317
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:30,683
这猴尿大家喝五个小时也喝不醉啊
It'll take us five hours to get drunk on this monkey's piss.

318
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,712
# He's not the first #

319
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,711
- # He's not the first #  - Oh, well.

320
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:43,949
圣诞快乐
- # He's the second best secret agent #  - Merry Christmas.

321
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,886
# In the whole wide world

322
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,510
# He's not number one #

323
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,184
# But not the worst #

324
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,023
# He's just the second best secret agent #

325
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,894
# in the whole wide world #

326
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,691
# He's every bit #

327
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,030
# as good as what's-his-name #

328
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,031
# With a dame #

329
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,449
# Any dame #

330
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,951
# And all those bullet holes are in his vest

331
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,038
# To prove you work a little harder #

332
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,460
# When you're second best... #

333
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:28,757
赫鲁晓夫辞职的次日

334
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:33,757
他在家，忽然电话响了

335
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:35,256
一片静默...

336
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:37,456
“喂？请讲...”还是静默

337
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:39,456
“说话！我正听着呢！”

338
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,757
答复是：“亲爱的，你本该很早以前就听过了”

339
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:11,099
- 皮夫人问好
- 嗯？
- Courtesy of Mrs P.  - Hm?

340
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:13,307
你通宵了？
You been up all night?

341
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:16,110
是的
Yes.

342
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:25,162
这是什么？
What's this?

343
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:30,115
去行动基金要的1000英镑现金
Request for $1,000 in cash from the Reptile fund.

344
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:32,493
给一个叫埃尔斯的先生
To a Mr Ellis.

345
00:38:32,628 --> 00:38:35,167
吉姆•普里多的一个工作化名
It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.

346
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:39,170
普里多一年前于匈牙利遇害
Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago.

347
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:40,796
10月21日
October 21.

348
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:45,761
那为何还有人于两个月后给他1000英镑？
So why was someone giving him $1,000 two months later?

349
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:50,764
那我不禁要想他到底现在在哪儿呢？
I wonder where he is then, sir.

350
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:58,456
该死的车在哪？我们不能失去他，来抬一下

351
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:21,924
安静
Settle down now.

352
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:32,265
- 发下去
- 是，先生
- Hand those out.  - Sir.

353
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,275
这是什么？巴黎圣母院的敲钟人？
What is it? The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?

354
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,068
钟，钟！
The bells, the bells!

355
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:08,017
噢！
Ohh!

356
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:23,405
出来吧
Come here.

357
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,286
- 叫什么名字？
- 罗奇，比尔•罗奇
- What's your name?  - Roach. Bill Roach, sir.

358
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:34,043
- 我是新生
- 新来的哦？
- I'm a new boy.  - New arrival, eh?

359
00:40:34,175 --> 00:40:37,292
- 怎么回事？
- 我父亲和母亲
- What's the story?  - My mother and father.

360
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:41,382
我父亲离开了，所以…
My father left, so...

361
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:42,843
嗯
Hm.

362
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,434
比尔（账单）
Bill.

363
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:48,269
未付账的账单
The unpaid Bill.

364
00:40:49,774 --> 00:40:52,809
- 有人那么叫你吗？
- 没有，先生
- Anyone ever call you that?  - No, sir.

365
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:55,019
我认识很多叫比尔的人
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

366
00:40:57,114 --> 00:40:59,237
他们都是好人
They've all been good 'uns.

367
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:03,322
你擅长什么？
What are you good at?

368
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:04,997
一无所长，先生
Nothing, sir.

369
00:41:05,123 --> 00:41:07,958
但你擅于观察，对吗？
You're a good watcher, though, eh?

370
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:10,584
我们孤独者都如此
Us loners always are.

371
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,048
一旦你带上眼镜，我打赌，比尔•罗奇
Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'II bet.

372
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,846
- 你一定是班上最好的观察者，对吗？
- 是的，先生
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right?  - Yes, sir.

373
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:27,303
很好，非常好
This is good, very good.

374
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,945
你好，里基
Hello, Ricki.

375
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,488
你疏忽了门上的楔子
You've missed the wedge.

376
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:13,003
你去哪了，里基？
Where have you been, Ricki?

377
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:17,752
他们追杀我
They're going to kill me.

378
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,387
- 谁？
- 你们的人
- Who is?  - Your lot.

379
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:24,844
或许是他们的人，无论谁逮到，我都得死
Or their lot. Whoever gets me first.

380
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,063
我是清白的
I'm innocent.

381
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:31,687
我有我的理由
Within reason.

382
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:35,445
你来这多久了？
How long have you been here?

383
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:38,492
对不起，我走投无路
Sorry, I've run out of places now.

384
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,528
我需要见你
I needed to see you.

385
00:43:41,456 --> 00:43:42,915
为什么？
Why?

386
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:46,790
有一个女人
There's a woman.

387
00:43:48,254 --> 00:43:51,788
我需要你去交易帮我把她从卡拉那弄回来
I need you to trade for her. I need you to get her back off Karla.

388
00:43:55,094 --> 00:43:56,719
什么女人？
A woman?

389
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:01,511
她叫依瑞娜
Her name's Irina.

390
00:44:05,438 --> 00:44:07,597
去年十一月
This was last November.

391
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:12,561
吉勒姆先生派我去伊斯坦布尔调查一个俄贸代表
Mr Guillam sent me to Istanbul to check out a Russian trade delegate

392
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,604
这人有被说服投靠我方的可能
who might be persuaded to defect.

393
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:17,575
- 叫塔夫帝•赛森哲，驻外政治代表
- 就是他
- Tufty Thesinger, resident.  - Yeah.

394
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:19,160
- 你好，里基
- 旅程还行吧，伙计？
- Hiya, Ricki.  - All right, mate?

395
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:22,905
- 你认识他？
- 不，没见过
- Did you know him?  -No, never met him.

396
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,748
那人有点嗜酒
Bit of a drinker.

397
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,454
宿醉的鬼样
Hangover from hell.

398
00:44:26,586 --> 00:44:28,660
挺白痴的
Bit of a fucking idiot.

399
00:44:31,006 --> 00:44:32,916
很明显这个叫鲍里斯的俄国人
Apparently this Russian, name of Boris,

400
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,458
混迹于各个夜店，浪荡挥霍
was spending high and wide in the nightclubs.

401
00:44:35,595 --> 00:44:38,169
你就是来游说这个鲍里斯的？
So you were sent to persuade this Boris? 

402
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:41,676
是的，他就是典型的俄国人
Yeah. He was your typical Russian.

403
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:44,929
天亮贸易谈判，夜晚寻欢作乐
Trade delegation by day, out boozing every night.

404
00:44:45,063 --> 00:44:46,937
乐此不疲
Didn't seem to sleep.

405
00:44:47,065 --> 00:44:49,189
这可把跟踪他的塔夫帝给熬倒了
Tufty was worn out from following him around.'

406
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:52,189
漫漫长夜啊，孩子
I think it's going to be a long night, son.

407
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:55,110
他常出没于塔克西姆广场的一个夜总会
His favourite haunt was this club in Taksim.

408
00:44:55,242 --> 00:44:59,738
地下室有个“天上人间”，水手和游客常常光顾
It had a hellhole in the basement where the sailors and the tourists went.

409
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:05,417
总之，我看他一眼，就觉得我这趟白跑了。
Anyway, I took one look at him and I knew I'd wasted a journey.

410
00:45:07,629 --> 00:45:09,337
鲍里斯不是什么代表
Boris was no delegate.

411
00:45:10,758 --> 00:45:14,375
有哪个代表会醉成这样？除非是装的
What delegate bothers to play drunker than he really is?

412
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:18,550
我们得学会认出同行，是不是，史迈利先生？
You get to recognise your own, don't you, Mr Smiley?

413
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,426
鲍里斯是莫斯科“中心”
And Boris was a hood

414
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,337
训练出来的间谍
Moscow Centre trained.

415
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,884
# Someone is waiting #

416
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,802
# I mean just for you #

417
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,179
# Spinning wheel #

418
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,770
# Keep on spinning through, Drop all your troubles... #

419
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:37,779
我猜他在等接头
I guessed he was waiting for a connect.

420
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,903
也可能在搞一个微缩胶卷
Working a letterbox, maybe.

421
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,619
或者拖着他的大衣，在人群中找一个像我这样的人给他信号
Or trailing his coat and looking for a pass from some mug like me.'

422
00:45:46,753 --> 00:45:49,958
所以次夜我去了趟进出口机构
So the second night I went to the import/export outfit

423
00:45:50,091 --> 00:45:54,718
塔夫帝在深处设了间密室
that Tufty had set up with a cipher room hidden in the back.

424
00:45:54,846 --> 00:45:57,929
我发送了“不外售”的电报给吉勒姆先生
I cabled "No sale" to Mr Guillam.

425
00:45:59,058 --> 00:46:01,051
就那样
And that was that.

426
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:04,721
次日你本该飞回来
You were due to fly home the next day.

427
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:06,316
是的
Yes.

428
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:10,019
但你没有
But you didn't.

429
00:46:23,544 --> 00:46:25,748
鲍里斯有一个老婆
Boris had a wife.

430
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:27,336
法律上的妻子
Common-law.

431
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:32,294
显然她也是有一席之地的代表团成员
Apparently she was a member of the delegation in her own right.

432
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:33,856
史迈利先生，您曾教导我相信对女人的直觉
You once told me to trust my instincts about women, Mr Smiley.

433
00:47:35,202 --> 00:47:38,652
我的直觉告诉我，这个女人有料
Well, my instincts told me this woman had some treasure.

434
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:47,289
那晚当鲍里斯出去后，我告诉自己该去旅馆找她
When Boris went out for the night, I found myself going into her hotel.'

435
00:47:47,424 --> 00:47:49,298
所以你放弃跟踪鲍里斯
So you dropped Boris.

436
00:47:49,426 --> 00:47:52,758
我知道我坏了规矩
I know. It was breaking protocol.

437
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:58,137
但可以说是我不由自主地在行动
But I was acting on my own initiative, as it were.

438
00:47:58,268 --> 00:48:01,222
你男人真混蛋，不是吗？
Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?

439
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:04,475
我只是想看看你有没有事，好吗？
I just wanted to make sure you were all right, OK?

440
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:06,729
所以你没有回来？
So you didn't come home?

441
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:10,898
本该回的
I would have.

442
00:48:11,031 --> 00:48:13,154
最后鲍里斯那条路是个死胡同，可是…
Boris was a dead end, but...

443
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:16,661
唔…
Um...

444
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:18,652
我可以…
I could...

445
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:22,874
我可以在她身上感觉到某种东西
I could sense something in her.

446
00:48:24,128 --> 00:48:26,371
她有秘密
A secret.

447
00:48:26,506 --> 00:48:31,928
那你打算怎么从她那弄到这个秘密？
And how did you intend to get this secret out of her?

448
00:48:39,268 --> 00:48:42,222
我装成一个叫迈克尔•钱奇的商人
I played this businessman, Michael Trench.

449
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:48,313
共度浪漫假日
Holiday romance.

450
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:54,898
我心想不着急
I thought I'd take my time with it.

451
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:47,997
我知道你的真实身份
I know who you are.

452
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:52,844
我要跟你的上司谈话
I want to talk to your boss.

453
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:54,596
老总
Control.

454
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:59,806
我有东西要交易
I have something to trade.

455
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:01,514
很重要
Something big.

456
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:05,269
我想在西方重新生活
I want a new life in the West.

457
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,980
这就是我的要求
That's the deal.

458
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,283
你转告他们
You tell them.

459
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:25,871
听着，别指望他们对任何情报都欣然接受
Look, you can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.

460
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:33,299
如果你不能提供更多的情报，我也无能为力
If you won't tell me more, there is nothing I can do.

461
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:41,690
若我全盘托出
If I tell you everything,

462
00:50:41,816 --> 00:50:43,725
那我就把命交到你的手里了
I'm putting my life in your hands.

463
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:48,145
还有其他人的命
And the lives of other people.

464
00:51:49,678 --> 00:51:52,597
于是她就告诉了我她要交换的
So she told me what she had to trade.

465
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:56,343
秘密
Her secret.

466
00:51:56,478 --> 00:51:58,802
我意思是
I mean,

467
00:51:58,938 --> 00:52:01,096
所有秘密的源头
the mother of all secrets.

468
00:52:04,278 --> 00:52:06,769
我告诉她我会通知“马戏团”的
I told her I'd alert the Circus.

469
00:52:06,905 --> 00:52:10,489
她要我保证不能向伦敦透露任何细节
She made me promise I wouldn't give any of the details to London.

470
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:13,534
- 你同意了
- 是的
- And you agreed?  - Yes.

471
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,454
我意思…
I mean it was...

472
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:19,868
我都不敢相信我搞到了这么大的情报
I couldn't believe I'd got hold of something this big.

473
00:52:20,002 --> 00:52:22,790
我回到进出口机构
I went back to the import export,

474
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:26,966
给“马戏团”发了封“最高紧急级别”的电报
sent the message to the Circus, graded, "Flash, highest priority",

475
00:52:27,092 --> 00:52:30,342
说我有一个想叛变的莫斯科同行
just that I had a Moscow-trained hood wanting to defect.

476
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:35,300
你怎么还没走，伦敦当局找上我了
You're supposed to have gone. London stations have been on to me.

477
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:37,725
想知道你到底在搞什么鬼
Want to know what the hell you're doing.

478
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:44,187
滚开
Fuck off.

479
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:47,404
还有吗，里基？
Anything else, Ricki? 

480
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,741
我知道对于“马戏团”，我只是一名头皮猎人
I know what I am to the Circus. I'm one of the scalp-hunters,

481
00:52:54,873 --> 00:52:57,789
那些下作肮脏的任务都可以扔给我干
someone that you can hand your dirty little jobs to.

482
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:02,921
我只是…
I just...

483
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,255
我只是想把这件事摊给自己而已
I just wanted to bring this one in myself.

484
00:53:07,386 --> 00:53:09,710
我理解你的感受
Well, I understand how you felt.

485
00:53:11,932 --> 00:53:14,220
你想有所成就
You wanted to do something.

486
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:15,058
我说她有关系到“马戏团”安危的

487
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:16,526
I said that she claimed to have information 

488
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:19,725
重要情报
Vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

489
00:53:22,945 --> 00:53:24,651
还有吗？
Anything more?

490
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:40,825
我还说她的情报事关一个双面间谍…
I said that she had information concerning a double agent.

491
00:53:44,091 --> 00:53:48,469
听着，我只想引起足够的重视，而且…
Look, I just wanted to get the proper attention. And I'd...

492
00:53:50,265 --> 00:53:52,554
我告诉他们这就是我当时没有回来的原因
I told them this was the reason why I had not come home.

493
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:54,972
并不是我叛变了什么的
It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.

494
00:53:56,604 --> 00:53:59,771
- 你之后怎么做的？
- 我等待回复
- What did you do then?  - I waited for a reply.

495
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:08,615
我来回走了几个小时，还听到了穆斯林的祈祷昭告
I hung around for hours. I remember heard the lmsak call to prayer.

496
00:54:08,741 --> 00:54:12,609
之后，凌晨3点半左右吧
- So what's that time?  - That's about 3. 30 in the morning.'

497
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:16,999
电报来了
Then the message comes through.

498
00:54:21,006 --> 00:54:23,293
“知道了”
"We read you."

499
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:27,588
仅此，别无他言
That was all they sent. Nothing.

500
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:32,096
讲不通啊，他们就像在拖延时间
It didn't make sense. It was like they were stalling.

501
00:54:38,816 --> 00:54:40,724
然后呢？
Then what happened?

502
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:43,813
突然…
Then, all of a sudden...

503
00:54:45,531 --> 00:54:47,987
俄国佬开始行动了
the Russians begin to move.

504
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,275
手法漂亮，就像我亲自下手的一样
It was nice work. I couldn't have done it better myself.

505
00:55:31,747 --> 00:55:35,696
这信息很明了，我得警告她
The message was quite clear. I needed to warn her. '

506
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:57,000
哈山...我能用下你的电话么？

507
00:55:57,857 --> 00:56:00,456
可以，用那个吧

508
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,350
快点，快点
Come on, come on, come on.

509
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,826
我在机场找不到她
I looked for her everywhere couldn't find her at the airport.

510
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:54,792
我几乎查看了所有的班次…
I even looked through all the flight lists and...

511
00:56:56,586 --> 00:56:58,248
还去了港口
I headed down to the harbour.

512
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:11,556
他们把她押到了去敖德萨(乌克兰港市)的船上
They put her on a ship to Odessa.

513
00:57:13,854 --> 00:57:15,729
我只知道这么多
That's all I know.

514
00:57:25,951 --> 00:57:27,410
我…
I've...

515
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:36,746
我此生做了很多事情，史迈利先生，可…
I've done a lot of things in my life, Mr Smiley, but...

516
00:57:42,802 --> 00:57:46,383
她却让我难以忘怀
I just... I can't stop thinking about her.

517
00:57:50,643 --> 00:57:52,719
她甚至不是我喜欢的类型
She wasn't even my type.

518
00:57:56,942 --> 00:57:59,148
我得把她弄出来，我欠她的
I've got to get her out. I owe her that.

519
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:07,945
卡拉会找你的
Karla will be looking for you.

520
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,867
人人都在找我
Everybody's looking for me.

521
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:15,618
此地不宜久留
You can't stay here.

522
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:19,713
不安全
It isn't safe.

523
00:58:22,844 --> 00:58:24,156
我说：“你可以对我不屑
但早上见到我你还得管我叫 ‘先生’”

524
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:27,790
I said, "You may fuck me but you'll call me "Sir" in the morning."

525
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:31,971
好了，只是想让你知道
OK. Just need to let you know.

526
00:58:32,103 --> 00:58:36,102
有人上周飞达巴黎了，
是我们的人，逃过了护照检查
Someone flew into Paris last week on one of our escaped passports.

527
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:39,520
- 然后呢？
- 此人就是里基•塔尔
- And?  - lt wasRicki Tarr.

528
00:58:41,156 --> 00:58:42,816
你告诉我这个干什么？
Why are you telling me? 

529
00:58:42,947 --> 00:58:45,866
- 可能是巧合吧…
- 你这个脑残死矮子
- It could be coincidence...  - You are a poisoned dwarf.

530
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:47,487
你为何不滚回你的陛下那儿去？
Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty?

531
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,993
别指望我成为你滑稽秀的一员
and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret 

532
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:57,203
伊斯特哈斯先生说：“可能是巧合吧…”
Mr Esterhase: "It could be coincidence,but..."

533
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:01,041
海顿先生打断说
Mr Haydon interrupting.

534
00:59:01,176 --> 00:59:03,797
“你这个脑残死矮子”
You really are a poisoned dwarf, Toby.

535
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:06,805
你为何不滚回你的陛下（指珀西）那儿去？
Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

536
00:59:06,933 --> 00:59:09,424
别指望我成为你滑稽秀的一员
and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?

537
00:59:22,198 --> 00:59:23,610
你看起来很疲惫
You look tired.

538
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,862
没睡好
I didn't sleep well.

539
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:33,370
彼得，为我做点事
You're going to do something for me, Peter.

540
00:59:34,336 --> 00:59:37,836
我需要去年11月值班处的登记日志
I need the duty officer's log book for last November.

541
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:43,795
我不得不更进一步送你去虎穴
I'm going to have to send you up a floor into the lions' den.

542
00:59:48,226 --> 00:59:49,636
你若被逮
If you're caught, you can't mention me.

543
00:59:51,605 --> 00:59:54,096
不能招出我来

544
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:56,901
很抱歉，可是你只能靠自己
I'm sorry, but you're alone.

545
00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:00,903
- 去年11月的？
- 嗯
- Last November?  - Hm.

546
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:12,832
吉勒姆先生！
Mr Guillam!

547
01:00:15,504 --> 01:00:16,963
谢谢你，布莱恩特
Thank you, Bryant.

548
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:18,334
家人还好吧？
How's the family?

549
01:00:18,465 --> 01:00:20,839
挺好的，我今天要上登记处去
Fine. Need to go up to the registry today.

550
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:22,547
好的
OK, sir.

551
01:00:23,472 --> 01:00:26,555
那你得为你的箱子拿个黄色权限，先生
Now you'll need a yellow one for the bag, sir.

552
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,431
谢谢
Thank you.

553
01:00:54,211 --> 01:00:56,583
- 早安，吉勒姆先生
- 早，阿尔文
- Good morning, Mr Guillam.  - Morning, Alwyn.

554
01:00:56,714 --> 01:00:59,170
- 需要我帮您保管吗？
- 谢谢
- Want me to look after that for you?  - Thank you.

555
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:07,016
我得看看您的权限，吉勒姆先生
I'll need your chit, Mr Guillam.

556
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,969
上头要是知道我省了这步程序非杀了我不可，
这是新规定
Dolphin will kill me if I don't. New rules.

557
01:01:11,021 --> 01:01:12,646
请便
So, chit me.

558
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:20,072
谢谢
Thanks.

559
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:24,157
- 桑儿，很高兴见到你
- 彼得
- So lovely surprise.  - Peter.

560
01:01:31,544 --> 01:01:33,951
- 周末做什么去？
- 你知道的
- What are you up to this weekend?  - Oh, you know.

561
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:37,756
拜访七大姑八大姨
Visiting aunts.

562
01:01:37,883 --> 01:01:39,792
我猜就是
I'll bet.

563
01:01:47,853 --> 01:01:49,312
D走廊
Corridor D.

564
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:51,643
中途右侧88号
The two eights are halfway on your right.

565
01:01:51,772 --> 01:01:53,600
111号在下一个凹室
The three ones are next alcove down.

566
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:55,606
多谢
Thanks.

567
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,123
Here's a request from Libby Barr from Bromley

568
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,048
for Mr Wu's A Window Cleaner Now". Take it away, George.

569
01:03:03,266 --> 01:03:04,806
你好，档案部，我是阿尔文，请讲
Hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.

570
01:03:06,602 --> 01:03:08,428
我找吉勒姆
Can I speak to Mr Guillam, please? '

571
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,436
我是他的修车工
I'm his car mechanic.

572
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:16,189
我去看看他是否有空，请稍等
Well, I'll just see if he's available. Hold on, please.

573
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,207
# Mr Wu, what shall I do?#

574
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:32,457
- 天哪！
- 有你电话，先生
- Oh, Christ!  - Telephone, sir.

575
01:03:32,586 --> 01:03:35,423
- 什么人？
- 外线，一个大老粗
- Who is it? - Outside line, sir. Someone rough.

576
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:47,094
先生？
Sir?

577
01:03:48,353 --> 01:03:51,557
- 喂？
- 您的变速箱崩了，先生
- Hello?  - Your gearbox is bust, sir.

578
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:53,980
该死，你难道不会修吗？
Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?

579
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,273
不好修
Can't be done. Probably you need a new gear box, sir.

580
01:03:55,403 --> 01:03:57,562
恐怕得换了

581
01:03:57,698 --> 01:04:01,399
给经销商打电话好不，你有他们电话吗？
Well, phone the main dealership first. Have you got their number?

582
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:02,649
没有
No.

583
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:04,778
等下，阿尔文！
Hang on. Alwyn!

584
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:08,367
- 阿尔文
- 什么事？
- Alwyn.  - Sir?

585
01:04:08,501 --> 01:04:09,960
把我的包给我，可以吗？
Get me my bag, will you?

586
01:04:10,086 --> 01:04:11,829
- 可…
- 就一下
- But...  - Just for a second.

587
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:21,343
谢谢
Thank you.

588
01:04:21,472 --> 01:04:22,931
等下
Hang on.

589
01:04:38,365 --> 01:04:40,441
- 在吗？
- 我在听
- Hello?  - I'm listening.

590
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:43,863
- 记住了，先生
- Yes. 9-4-6-0-3-3-5.  - Be right on it, sir.

591
01:04:43,997 --> 01:04:45,537
谢谢
Thank you.

592
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,627
彼得•吉勒姆
Peter Guillam.

593
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:54,246
能跟我们见个面吗？
Could we see you, please?

594
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:56,375
珀西有些紧急的话要跟你说
Percy would like quite an urgent word with you.

595
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:59,428
如果你现在能去趟五楼，就最好不过了
If you can come now to the fifth floor that would be so kind.

596
01:04:59,553 --> 01:05:00,964
好的
Yes, of course.

597
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,011
替我把这扔到升降机里去
Throw that into the lift for me.

598
01:05:05,143 --> 01:05:07,681
送到三楼，省的我去填那些烦人的单子
Send it to the second floor, save me filling out bloody chits.

599
01:05:07,813 --> 01:05:09,438
放心，先生
Will do, sir.

600
01:05:28,543 --> 01:05:31,379
你最近都在忙些什么呢？
So what have you been getting up to down there these days?

601
01:05:31,505 --> 01:05:33,793
除了调戏我们的黄花大闺女们？
Apart from chasing our virgins.

602
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:38,254
一些在阿拉伯的行动看上去会有些斩获
A couple of Arab ploys that look quite promising.

603
01:05:40,348 --> 01:05:42,674
除此之外，我在乒乓球上大为精进
Apart from that, I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

604
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,634
阿拉伯人
Arabs.

605
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:47,390
你可以租借他们，但无法收买他们,对吧，比尔？
You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right, Bill?

606
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:53,731
里基•塔尔近来如何？
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

607
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:56,780
挺好的，我们每天在福特纳姆喝下午茶
Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.

608
01:05:58,449 --> 01:06:01,367
我想知道你与塔尔谈话的内容
I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.

609
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:03,653
我会转告他的，他会很兴奋的
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

610
01:06:11,548 --> 01:06:13,420
你耸什么肩？
What's that shrug for?

611
01:06:16,385 --> 01:06:18,294
我在跟你谈论一个叛徒
I'm talking to you about the traitor

612
01:06:18,429 --> 01:06:21,929
他在伊斯坦布尔把我们的人割喉了
who cut the throat of our man in Istanbul.

613
01:06:22,059 --> 01:06:25,344
我在讲一个反水的，而他是该死的你的手下
I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section.

614
01:06:25,479 --> 01:06:29,392
我控告你，背着我，与一名敌方特工勾结
I'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back.

615
01:06:29,524 --> 01:06:31,896
所以别他妈的对我耸肩
Don't damn well shrug at me!

616
01:06:32,903 --> 01:06:34,980
要不你去监狱呆上一会？
How would you like a term in prison?

617
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:48,794
好吧，我没有见过他
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

618
01:06:50,755 --> 01:06:53,044
你能老实点别随便咬人么？
So get your facts straight and get off my back!

619
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:57,006
那么…我若告诉你塔尔最近到巴黎了
So... if I told you Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

620
01:06:57,136 --> 01:06:58,963
你会吃惊么？
would you be surprised?

621
01:06:59,096 --> 01:07:01,220
不会的，里基•塔尔的任何动作都不会令我惊讶
No, nothing would surprise me about Ricki Tarr.

622
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,099
那我若告诉你我们偶然发现他的银行账户
And if I told you we happen to know 30,000 mysteriously appeared

623
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,520
多了30000英镑来路不明的钱
in his bank account last month,

624
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,974
你会惊讶吗？
would that surprise you?

625
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,203
你手下是个叛徒，吉勒姆
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

626
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:21,008
被敌方几个月前收买，如今人家把他派回来了
Turned by the opposition months ago 

627
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:22,686
and now they've sent him back to us.

628
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:25,658
- 为什么？ 
- 这不重要
- What for?  - Never mind what for.

629
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,283
就是要弄得我们鸡犬不宁
To muddy the water, that's what for.

630
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,370
散步大量假情报让我们自乱阵脚
To spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

631
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,919
关键是
The point is this.

632
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:35,594
他要回英国
He's heading for home.

633
01:07:36,763 --> 01:07:38,885
你看到他的第一眼，就立刻来爸爸们这儿报告
The first peep from him, you come to the grown-ups.

634
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:40,722
明白？
Understood?

635
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:44,350
除了在坐的，谁都不许告诉
Anyone you see around this table but not another damn soul.

636
01:07:47,232 --> 01:07:48,810
出去
Get out.

637
01:07:56,241 --> 01:07:57,651
彼得？
Peter?

638
01:08:03,123 --> 01:08:04,867
谢谢你，贝琳达
Thank you, Belinda.

639
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:12,236
# Oh, Mr Wu #

640
01:08:12,372 --> 01:08:14,112
# What shall I do? #

641
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:21,370
# Oh, Mr Wu #

642
01:08:21,507 --> 01:08:23,293
# What shall I do? #

643
01:08:23,425 --> 01:08:24,961
# Mr Wu... #

644
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:35,655
还顺利吧？
All go smoothly, did it?

645
01:08:35,783 --> 01:08:37,573
我得去旅馆见乔治
I need to go to the hotel to see George.

646
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,702
史迈利先生不在旅馆，换地方了
Mr Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue.

647
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:54,086
乔治？
George?

648
01:09:02,437 --> 01:09:04,477
吉勒姆先生…
Mr Guillam...

649
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:07,640
很抱歉耽搁那么久才回来
Sorry it took me so long to come home.

650
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:21,696
里基一直在帮我们，彼得
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

651
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:24,916
他告诉了我们他的所有经历
He's been telling us all about his adventures.

652
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:27,956
他是双重间谍，乔治
He's a double, George.

653
01:09:28,088 --> 01:09:31,043
根本没有“鼹鼠”，整个事件都是俄国人一手策划的
There is no mole. Whole thing's been thought up by Moscow.

654
01:09:31,176 --> 01:09:33,382
卡拉用30000块收买他
Karla bought him for 30,000.

655
01:09:33,511 --> 01:09:36,381
为了你我去偷那些文件
I stole that because of you.

656
01:09:36,513 --> 01:09:38,072
我亲自做间谍都是因为他，你知道我的感受吗？
I spied on my own because of him. 

657
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:40,082
Do you know how that makes me feel?

658
01:09:40,267 --> 01:09:41,513
里基…
Ricki...

659
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:42,977
你说给“马戏团”发电报，提及依瑞娜的情报
you said you sent the Circus a telegram 

660
01:09:42,987 --> 01:09:45,205
concerning Irina's information.

661
01:09:45,357 --> 01:09:47,314
- 没错
- 什么时候？
- That's right.  - What was the date?

662
01:09:47,442 --> 01:09:49,398
他不知道，因为就没发
He doesn't know because there was no telegram.

663
01:09:49,526 --> 01:09:53,062
- 整个事情都是他杜撰的
- 11月20日
- The whole thing is a fabrication.  - 20th November.

664
01:09:53,197 --> 01:09:56,234
我清楚的记得是11月20日，晚
It must have been 20th November. Evening.

665
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:58,942
依瑞纳告诉我俄国“中心”…
lrina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

666
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,571
高层的每个人都笑得肚子痛
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

667
01:10:01,707 --> 01:10:05,455
- 她告诉我卡拉…
- 11月20日…没有了
- She told me Karla...  - November 20th is missing.

668
01:10:05,585 --> 01:10:09,584
有人销毁了记录，除非你觉得
Someone is covering their tracks, unless of course you think

669
01:10:09,716 --> 01:10:11,625
这是巧合？
that's just a coincidence?

670
01:10:15,723 --> 01:10:17,301
那么钱呢？
What about the money?

671
01:10:17,433 --> 01:10:21,347
用30000块来保护他的“鼹鼠”，对卡拉来说不算多
30,000 isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his mole.

672
01:10:22,937 --> 01:10:26,722
恐怕“马戏团”里有人对塔尔了如指掌
I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mr Tarr

673
01:10:28,152 --> 01:10:30,821
尽其所能去栽赃给他
and is doing everything they can to discredit him.

674
01:10:30,946 --> 01:10:34,397
“马戏团”自认为重要的情报不过是俄国“中心”制造的垃圾
Everything the Circus thinks its' gold is shit, made in Moscow.

675
01:10:38,954 --> 01:10:43,000
你为什么不告诉我你窝藏了塔尔？
Why didn't you tell me that you had Tarr?

676
01:10:47,671 --> 01:10:49,830
...是怕我入了虎穴再也回不来了
In case I never made it out of the Circus.I should get some rest.

677
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:53,216
我要休息一下

678
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,053
估摸着你也有些阅读工作要做
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

679
01:10:58,517 --> 01:11:00,095
跟我来
Come up.

680
01:11:12,198 --> 01:11:14,072
我见过他一次
I met him once.

681
01:11:15,494 --> 01:11:17,035
卡拉
Karla.

682
01:11:18,704 --> 01:11:20,080
在1955年
In 55.

683
01:11:23,252 --> 01:11:25,541
俄国的“中心”支离破碎
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

684
01:11:27,632 --> 01:11:30,750
一个接一个的清洗
Purge after purge.

685
01:11:30,884 --> 01:11:33,257
他们半数的间谍都叛逃了
Half their agents were jumping ship.

686
01:11:34,721 --> 01:11:36,927
我四处奔走，把他们拉入阵营
I travelled around, signing them up.

687
01:11:38,476 --> 01:11:39,935
好几百号人
Hundreds of them.

688
01:11:43,606 --> 01:11:46,440
有一个自称是格斯特曼的人
One of them was calling himself Gerstmann.

689
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:49,602
他准备回俄国
He was on his way back to Russia

690
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:53,189
而我们当时也很确信他回去会被处决
and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed.

691
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:57,822
飞机要在德里停24小时，我要用那仅有的一天
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi and that's how long I had

692
01:11:57,956 --> 01:12:01,074
说服他投靠我们
to convince him to come over to us

693
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:03,284
别傻乎乎的回国去死
instead of going home to die.

694
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:10,716
在那个小屋子
There's a little room.

695
01:12:13,305 --> 01:12:16,838
我坐这儿，他坐那儿
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

696
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:24,932
美国佬对他严刑逼供过
The Americans had him tortured.

697
01:12:29,029 --> 01:12:31,105
他连指甲都没了
He had no fingernails.

698
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:36,950
当时无比炎热
It's incredibly hot.

699
01:12:41,335 --> 01:12:45,747
我很累，只想快点结束，然后回家
I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home.

700
01:12:48,591 --> 01:12:51,083
又跟安闹别扭
Things weren't going well with Ann.

701
01:12:55,015 --> 01:12:56,724
我对他来老的那一套
I give him the usual pitch.

702
01:12:56,851 --> 01:13:00,894
“来西方吧，告诉我们你知道的
"Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life,

703
01:13:02,106 --> 01:13:03,980
“然后我们给你安稳的生活”
"after questioning."

704
01:13:07,988 --> 01:13:09,779
他怎么回答？
What did he say?

705
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:16,738
“想想你的妻子
"Think of your wife.

706
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,581
“你有妻子，对吧？
You have a wife, don't you?

707
01:13:25,089 --> 01:13:28,005
“我给你带了点烟
Here. I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.

708
01:13:32,179 --> 01:13:33,803
“用我的打火机
Use my lighter.

709
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:44,221
“我们能安排她也过来，我们手上有很多交换筹码
We could arrange for her to join you. We have a lot of stock to trade.

710
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:49,438
“如果你回去，她会被流放的，想想她
If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her."

711
01:13:49,573 --> 01:13:51,281
“想想吧”…
"Think about..."

712
01:13:55,912 --> 01:13:57,536
我一直…
I kept on...

713
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:01,240
喋喋不休地说他的妻子
harping on about the damn wife,

714
01:14:03,754 --> 01:14:05,877
把自己的很多事也告诉他…
telling him more about me than...

715
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,544
我本该走掉
I should have walked out, of course.

716
01:14:13,847 --> 01:14:18,142
但冥冥之中觉得救他很重要，所以我继续
But for some reason it seemed important to save this one, so I go on.

717
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,775
“你我并非千差万别
"We're not so very different you and I.

718
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:27,063
“我们都竭尽一生
We've both spent our lives

719
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:30,564
“想要找出彼此制度上的缺陷
looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems."

720
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:35,944
“你不觉得现在你该承认
"Don't you think it's time to recognise

721
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,539
“你和我都一样的毫无价值吗？”
there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?"

722
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,716
他什么都没说
Never said a word.

723
01:15:02,275 --> 01:15:04,102
一个字都没说
Not one word.

724
01:15:13,285 --> 01:15:15,991
次日早晨他回到飞机上
And the next morning he got back on his plane.

725
01:15:17,499 --> 01:15:20,286
他还给我那包烟，没动过
He handed the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched.

726
01:15:20,419 --> 01:15:24,462
他本是个“烟鬼”，却一根没吸
This was a chain-smoker, you may mind.

727
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:28,753
他毅然决然地飞向了预想中的死亡
And he flew off to what he presumed would be his death.

728
01:15:32,599 --> 01:15:34,508
他保留了我的打火机
He kept my lighter.

729
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:40,056
就当是个礼物吧
It was a gift.

730
01:15:42,358 --> 01:15:44,435
“安赠予乔治
"To George from Ann.

731
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:48,731
“倾吾所爱”
All my love."

732
01:15:51,909 --> 01:15:53,569
他就是卡拉
That was Karla.

733
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:58,535
他宁愿死也不愿放弃
He went back to die rather than giving in.

734
01:16:01,421 --> 01:16:04,172
而正是如此，我知道他并非无懈可击
Yes, and that's how I know he can be beaten.

735
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,336
因为他是个疯狂的信徒
Because he's a fanatic.

736
01:16:12,015 --> 01:16:15,764
而这些信徒们永远都藏有一个秘密的困惑
And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.

737
01:16:21,566 --> 01:16:23,191
他长什么样？
What did he look like?

738
01:16:25,445 --> 01:16:27,402
记不得了
I can't remember.

739
01:16:49,013 --> 01:16:51,135
从今天起，彼得
After today, Peter,

740
01:16:52,599 --> 01:16:55,055
你必须意识到他们会监视你
you have to assume they're watching you.

741
01:17:00,691 --> 01:17:02,934
若有什么该清理的东西
If there's anything you need tidied up,

742
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:09,322
赶紧清理
now is the time.

743
01:17:23,799 --> 01:17:25,377
快完成了
Nearly done.

744
01:17:26,802 --> 01:17:28,510
哦上帝啊
For God's sake.

745
01:17:32,434 --> 01:17:35,849
有时我觉得他们都一样的白痴
Sometimes I think they're all sharing the same moronic brain.

746
01:17:46,782 --> 01:17:49,153
如果你有新欢了，你可以告诉我
If there's someone else, you can tell me.

747
01:17:51,745 --> 01:17:53,536
我是大人了
I'm a grown-up.

748
01:18:30,328 --> 01:18:34,740
我知道，这将是个美好的圣诞节
I know. It's just going to be such a wonderful Christmas.

749
01:18:34,873 --> 01:18:36,368
抱歉
Excuse me.

750
01:18:43,795 --> 01:18:47,834
# And I was too proud to give in #

751
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:58,428
# I had to learn the hard way #

752
01:19:00,817 --> 01:19:02,856
彼得，准备好了
Peter, when you're ready

753
01:19:02,986 --> 01:19:04,398
开始播放
Put it on now.

754
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,861
大家一起！
Everybody!

755
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:25,983
- 杰瑞
- 乔治
- Jerry. - George.

756
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,611
- 彼得
- 杰瑞
- Peter. - Jerry.

757
01:20:30,454 --> 01:20:32,696
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

758
01:20:32,831 --> 01:20:35,371
关于吉姆•普里多遇害的那晚
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.

759
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:39,376
那晚你值班，对吗？
You were duty officer, weren't you?

760
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:44,002
是的，那晚老总让我守着电话
Yeah. Control asked me to mind the phones that night.

761
01:20:45,094 --> 01:20:47,929
他说有人在执行一项特别任务
He said someone was doing a special job for the service.

762
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:49,847
他要自己信得过的人坐镇
He wanted someone he could trust.

763
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,668
'Hurricane Henry set to be ridden by Ray Walsh at 7:2...'

764
01:21:27,305 --> 01:21:29,097
出事了，长官
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

765
01:21:31,102 --> 01:21:33,640
这是从外交部过来的消息
This is from the FO resident clerk.

766
01:21:33,771 --> 01:21:36,263
一则匈牙利简要新闻
A Hungarian news bulletin.

767
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,558
“化名为埃利斯的英国间谍
"British spy, work name Ellis,

768
01:21:38,694 --> 01:21:40,851
“利用假护照潜入匈牙利
travelling with false Hungarian papers,

769
01:21:40,987 --> 01:21:45,650
“计划在布达佩斯绑架一名不愿意透露姓名的匈牙利将军
has attempted to kidnap an unnamed Hungarian General in Budapest.

770
01:21:46,786 --> 01:21:48,778
“据悉，此人已被击毙
He's been shot.

771
01:21:48,913 --> 01:21:50,988
“相关逮捕行动已经展开”
Other arrests imminent."

772
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,827
要我做个简报么？
Can I have a brief, please?

773
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:02,128
长官，您希望我发布否认声明吗？
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

774
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:10,512
我得回复，长官

775
01:22:10,643 --> 01:22:13,098
老总一个字也不跟我说
I couldn't get a word out of Control.

776
01:22:13,229 --> 01:22:16,314
我只能按照程序查询了紧急事务的处理方法
So I followed protocol and went for the emergency list.

777
01:22:19,571 --> 01:22:21,647
你打到我家了
You rang my house.

778
01:22:21,781 --> 01:22:24,270
碰碰运气看您是否从柏林回来了
Just on the off-chance you were back from Berlin.

779
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:25,819
你说什么了？
What did you say?

780
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:28,824
- 你好？
- 你好，史迈利夫人
- Hello? - Hello, Mrs Smiley.

781
01:22:28,953 --> 01:22:31,031
我是杰瑞，局里的杰瑞•韦斯特比
It's Jerry. Jerry Westerby from the office.

782
01:22:31,165 --> 01:22:33,454
出点小状况
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

783
01:22:33,584 --> 01:22:35,660
安说你尚未回来
Ann said you wasn't back yet and that was it.

784
01:22:36,878 --> 01:22:37,958
然后呢
Go on.

785
01:22:38,088 --> 01:22:39,630
都乱套了
All hell broke loose.

786
01:22:39,756 --> 01:22:42,165
军方说匈牙利的坦克已经在边界上了
Military yelling about Hungarian tanks on the border.

787
01:22:42,302 --> 01:22:44,971
老总和部长开始着急了
Lacon and the minister baying at the door.

788
01:22:45,847 --> 01:22:48,553
谢天谢地比尔•海顿在关键时刻出现了
Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

789
01:22:48,684 --> 01:22:49,883
- 海顿先生
- 现在不行！
- Mr. Haydon.  - Not now.

790
01:22:50,019 --> 01:22:51,346
海顿先生！
Mr. Haydon!

791
01:22:52,938 --> 01:22:53,934
出去！
Out!

792
01:22:55,858 --> 01:22:57,649
- 告诉我发生了什么
- 我试着找过你
- Tell me. - I tried to get hold of you.

793
01:22:57,776 --> 01:23:00,944
我已经从俱乐部的电报上得知大略了，告诉我
I got half a story on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.

794
01:23:02,157 --> 01:23:04,031
吉姆•普里多中枪了
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

795
01:23:08,578 --> 01:23:10,488
接通匈牙利大使馆
Get me the Hungarian embassy.

796
01:23:10,623 --> 01:23:12,414
你转告你的上司们若敢动吉姆•普里多一根毫毛
You go and tell your masters what will happen

797
01:23:12,542 --> 01:23:14,415
后果自负
if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged.

798
01:23:14,544 --> 01:23:17,462
让伊斯特哈斯接电话，让他召回我们在匈牙利所有的特工
Get Esterhase on the phone. Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

799
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,585
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

800
01:23:30,728 --> 01:23:33,267
有普里多的新消息吗？先生？
Any more news on him? Sir?

801
01:23:38,236 --> 01:23:39,646
天哪
Oh, God.

802
01:23:39,778 --> 01:23:42,483
赶紧去他的住处，清除所有相关的东西
We need to get down to his flat, clear out anything linked.

803
01:24:24,785 --> 01:24:27,787
海顿在他的俱乐部听到了消息？
Haydon heard the news at his club?

804
01:24:27,914 --> 01:24:29,194
在萨维尔俱乐部
It's arguable. 

805
01:24:29,332 --> 01:24:32,250
凌晨1：30？那么晚电报肯定下班了
At 1: 30? The ticker-tape wouldn't have been running.

806
01:24:32,377 --> 01:24:34,084
那他是怎么知道的？
So how did he know?

807
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:37,165
- 天啊，乔治
- 彼得！
- Jesus, George.  - Peter!

808
01:24:37,298 --> 01:24:39,837
- 他怎么知道的？
- 不是你所想的
- Jesus Christ! How could he have known?  - It's not what you think.

809
01:24:39,968 --> 01:24:43,884
- 那他是怎么知道的？
- 那晚他在我家
- Then how did he know?  - Because he was at my house that night.

810
01:25:14,005 --> 01:25:16,081
旅途还行吧？
Good flight?

811
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,709
还行
Yes.

812
01:25:20,844 --> 01:25:22,801
挺好的
Pleasant enough.

813
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:24,804
我路过，心想拜访一下
I was just passing. I thought I'd call in.

814
01:25:25,683 --> 01:25:28,969
安还在睡，但坚持要起来
Ann was in bed. She insisted on getting up.

815
01:25:29,104 --> 01:25:31,343
她说她一会儿下来
She said she'd be down in a minute.

816
01:25:33,106 --> 01:25:36,642
我带来的，其实是个很烂的涂鸦
That's what I'm dropping off. It's an awful daub really.

817
01:25:38,362 --> 01:25:40,652
不过安说喜欢
But Ann expressed a liking.

818
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,569
她喜欢哪一点？
What's keeping her?

819
01:26:02,263 --> 01:26:03,673
继续
Keep going.

820
01:26:04,848 --> 01:26:06,924
快点，小伙子们，跟上
Come on, lads. Keep up.

821
01:26:09,896 --> 01:26:11,688
快点，比尔！
Come on, Bill!

822
01:26:24,788 --> 01:26:27,457
- 戴上眼镜，胖子？
- 是，先生
- Got your specs on, Jumbo?  - Yes, sir.

823
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:29,240
过来
Come here.

824
01:26:35,716 --> 01:26:37,792
你看那是谁？
Who's that fellow down there?

825
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:41,676
我不认识
I don't know, sir.

826
01:26:41,805 --> 01:26:43,879
他是谁？
Who is he?

827
01:26:44,014 --> 01:26:45,888
乞丐？
Beggar man?

828
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,476
小偷？
Thief?

829
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:51,677
为什么他不看这边，嗯？
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

830
01:26:51,815 --> 01:26:55,648
换做是你，肯定会朝这群追着车嬉戏的孩子看的
Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car round a field?

831
01:26:56,863 --> 01:27:00,231
他怎么回事？讨厌我们？
What's the matter with him? Doesn't he like us?

832
01:27:00,365 --> 01:27:03,403
我不喜欢奇怪的家伙在旁边
I don't hold with odd-bods hanging around.

833
01:27:03,536 --> 01:27:06,110
他可能要偷阿尔维斯？
He might steal the Alvis.

834
01:27:06,248 --> 01:27:08,573
- 阿尔维斯是什么？
- 英国最好的车，先生
- Which is?  - The best car in England, sir.

835
01:27:12,169 --> 01:27:13,747
好小伙
Good lad.

836
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:27,137
你怎么领到布达佩斯任务的？
How were you briefed for the Budapest mission?

837
01:27:27,268 --> 01:27:30,305
老总让我去肯辛顿（伦敦地名）的一处公寓
Control asked me to come to a flat in Kensington.

838
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:35,528
有个内鬼，吉姆
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

839
01:27:37,531 --> 01:27:39,607
我们得找出来
And we have to find it.

840
01:27:41,575 --> 01:27:44,779
你是怎么理解的，吉姆？
What did you make of it, Jim?

841
01:27:44,913 --> 01:27:46,870
老总的说法？
Control's theory?

842
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:51,039
我觉得有点疯狂
I thought it was madness.

843
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:55,581
我知道是五人之一
I know that it is one of five men.

844
01:27:57,133 --> 01:28:00,883
你只用告诉我他们的代号
All I want from you is one code name.

845
01:28:07,896 --> 01:28:09,355
阿勒莱恩
Alleline. Tinker.

846
01:28:11,649 --> 01:28:13,227
“锅匠”

847
01:28:13,943 --> 01:28:15,402
海顿
Haydon. Tailor.

848
01:28:17,156 --> 01:28:18,733
“裁缝”

849
01:28:20,451 --> 01:28:21,911
布兰德
Bland. Soldier.

850
01:28:24,456 --> 01:28:25,913
“士兵”

851
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:30,209
我们不用“水手”，读音太接近“裁缝”了
We drop Sailor. It's too close to Tailor.

852
01:28:30,335 --> 01:28:32,495
“阔佬”又不太合适
And Rich Man doesn't seem to be applicable.

853
01:28:34,549 --> 01:28:36,008
伊斯特哈斯
Esterhase. Poor Man.

854
01:28:37,928 --> 01:28:40,215
“穷人”

855
01:28:45,644 --> 01:28:47,268
第五个呢？
And the fifth?

856
01:28:49,566 --> 01:28:51,060
史迈利
Smiley.

857
01:28:54,945 --> 01:28:57,021
我觉得太荒唐了
I thought it was madness.

858
01:28:58,449 --> 01:29:01,570
认为你们五人中有一个是叛徒
To think that any one of you could have been a traitor.

859
01:29:03,121 --> 01:29:04,780
这不是疯了是什么
Absolute madness.

860
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:09,625
但你还是去了
But you still went.

861
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:11,911
为什么？
Why? 

862
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:15,213
我去是因为老总之言
I went because Control asked me to go.

863
01:29:15,341 --> 01:29:17,834
这叫尽职
It's called doing one's duty.

864
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:33,817
在车站我遇到了可以带我去见将军的人
At the station I met the legman who was supposed to take me to the General.

865
01:29:33,946 --> 01:29:35,986
侍者一定是慌了
The waiter must have panicked.

866
01:29:36,115 --> 01:29:37,987
原本是个简单的任务
It was meant to be a simple snatch job.

867
01:29:44,748 --> 01:29:47,322
他们把我带到一个部队医院
They drove me to some military hospital,

868
01:29:47,459 --> 01:29:50,246
然后把我运上运输机
and then put me on a transport plane.

869
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:52,667
从星星来判断，我们在往东飞
I could tell by the stars we were heading east.

870
01:29:57,178 --> 01:29:59,254
然后他们拷问我…
Then they worked me for...

871
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,056
我不知道拷问了多久
I don't know how long.

872
01:30:04,186 --> 01:30:06,426
几周或者几个月
Weeks, maybe months.

873
01:30:46,815 --> 01:30:48,558
你跟他们说什么了？
What did you tell them?

874
01:30:50,066 --> 01:30:51,692
所有的
Everything.

875
01:30:53,987 --> 01:30:57,902
我尽可能地坚持，让其他人有时间撤离
I held on for as long as I could to let everyone get the hell out of there.

876
01:31:00,078 --> 01:31:01,536
他们逃走了吗？
Did they?

877
01:31:02,705 --> 01:31:05,492
我的匈牙利同伴们得救了吗？
My network s in Hungary, did they get out?

878
01:31:08,252 --> 01:31:10,329
没有，他们全栽了
No, they were blown.

879
01:31:12,549 --> 01:31:16,215
传闻说你为了免受皮肉之苦而告发了他们
The story is you blew them to save your own skin.

880
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:28,765
当拷问者都走了以后，有个矮个子男人出现了
After the interrogators had cleared out, this little fellow turned up.

881
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,776
像个神父
Looked like a priest.

882
01:31:34,279 --> 01:31:36,652
对我的逼供才真正开始
That's when they really started on me.

883
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:40,401
你的最后防线是什么？
What was your last line of defence, hmm?

884
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,657
“鼹鼠”
The mole.

885
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:47,118
老总疯狂的想法
Control's crazy theory.

886
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:52,747
我将它藏在内心最深处，他们挖不出来
I was going to bury that so deep they'd never get it out of me.

887
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:57,548
- 结果却是个笑话
- 为什么？
- Which was a joke.  - Why?

888
01:31:59,225 --> 01:32:01,597
因为他们早就知道了
Because they already knew.

889
01:32:01,727 --> 01:32:05,261
他们只是想看看老总到底挖了多深
All they wanted to know was how far Control had got in his investigation.

890
01:32:12,256 --> 01:32:14,656
你认识这个女人么？

891
01:32:20,903 --> 01:32:22,689
No, I don't know her.

892
01:32:28,356 --> 01:32:30,957
告诉阿勒莱恩我们做掉她了

893
01:32:43,312 --> 01:32:46,430
他们没有问起我吗？
Did they ask about me at all?

894
01:32:46,563 --> 01:32:48,022
问过
Yes.

895
01:32:49,067 --> 01:32:51,024
矮个子男人问过
The little fellow did.

896
01:32:53,322 --> 01:32:56,240
他怎么问的？
What did he say about me?

897
01:32:57,827 --> 01:33:00,033
他有一个打火机
He had this cigarette lighter.

898
01:33:01,497 --> 01:33:04,202
他拿着打火机在我面前不停地晃
He kept flashing it about for me to see it.

899
01:33:05,502 --> 01:33:07,744
给我看上面的字
Showed me the inscription.

900
01:33:07,879 --> 01:33:10,086
- “安赠予”…
- “乔治”
- "To George..."  - "... from Ann."

901
01:33:11,551 --> 01:33:13,259
“倾吾所爱”
"All my love."

902
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,599
是卡拉
Karla.

903
01:33:44,692 --> 01:33:48,863
安赠予-乔治
倾吾所爱

904
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:53,502
太奇怪了
It was odd.

905
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:57,545
他们把我送回英国
They sent me back to England.

906
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,218
直接到Sarratt（英国南部的一个小村庄）汇报情况
Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.

907
01:34:03,062 --> 01:34:08,058
他说在医院汇报情况的期间还有一位来访者
He said when he was being debriefed at the nursery, he had a visitor.

908
01:34:08,193 --> 01:34:09,308
谁？
Who?

909
01:34:09,445 --> 01:34:12,361
托比•伊斯特哈斯
Toby Esterhase.

910
01:34:12,488 --> 01:34:15,158
他给了他1000块和一辆阿尔维斯
He gave him 1,000 and an Alvis.

911
01:34:16,201 --> 01:34:19,535
并告诉他他现在身份上已经死了，永勿回来
Told him he was dead now. Couldn't come back.

912
01:34:19,664 --> 01:34:23,115
去过安逸的生活，忘掉发生的一切
Had to become a lotus eater, forget everything that happened.

913
01:34:23,251 --> 01:34:25,126
忘掉老总的事情
Control's theory.

914
01:34:25,254 --> 01:34:27,458
忘掉锅匠，裁缝等
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.

915
01:34:28,923 --> 01:34:31,544
我在想
Yes, that's what I thought.

916
01:34:31,675 --> 01:34:35,970
托比•伊斯特哈斯是怎么得知锅匠、裁缝这档子事的？
How on earth did Esterhase hear about Tinker, Tailor?

917
01:34:52,574 --> 01:34:54,780
依瑞纳告诉我俄国“中心”…
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

918
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:58,242
所有高层的人都笑得肚子疼
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

919
01:34:58,371 --> 01:35:00,778
她说卡拉为此颇为自豪
She told me Karla was very proud of this.

920
01:35:00,915 --> 01:35:04,119
她说，“马戏团”自认为重要的情报
不过是莫斯科“中心”炮制的垃圾
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

921
01:35:09,758 --> 01:35:11,879
依瑞纳告诉我俄国“中心”…
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

922
01:35:12,009 --> 01:35:14,927
所有高层的人都笑得肚子疼
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

923
01:35:15,055 --> 01:35:18,221
不，附近有家旅馆，他们有几间闲置室
No, I had a hotel nearby. They do have some seedy rooms.

924
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:20,390
依瑞纳告诉我俄国“中心”
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

925
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:24,055
所有高层的人都笑得肚子疼
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

926
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:26,146
她说卡拉以此为乐
She told me Karla was very proud of this... 

927
01:36:02,772 --> 01:36:05,181
她说，“马戏团”自认为重要的情报
不过是莫斯科“中心”炮制的垃圾
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit.

928
01:36:35,474 --> 01:36:38,676
这次会面从来都没有发生过，明白吗？
This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear?

929
01:36:39,852 --> 01:36:41,477
明白，部长大人
Perfectly, Minister.

930
01:36:46,318 --> 01:36:51,361
这城市里有栋房子
There is a house somewhere in this city

931
01:36:52,449 --> 01:36:56,197
阿勒莱恩等人在那里跟“巫术”的伦敦代表碰头
where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative.

932
01:36:56,328 --> 01:36:58,451
我想拉康跟你说得很明了了
I thought Lacon had made it clear to you.

933
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:02,200
不要插手“巫术”的事
Keep your nose bloody well out of Witchcraft's business.

934
01:37:02,335 --> 01:37:04,162
我听从的是拉康的建议啊
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

935
01:37:04,295 --> 01:37:06,868
你让我紧跟老总的脚步的
You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.

936
01:37:07,006 --> 01:37:11,669
想想老总给我们留下的烂摊子，
我不觉得这是个好建议
I wouldn't consider that sound advice, given the mess Control left us with.

937
01:37:12,804 --> 01:37:17,017
花了阿勒莱恩，以及，并非自夸，我本人
It has taken Alleline and, if I may say so, myself

938
01:37:17,143 --> 01:37:19,183
那么久才使“马戏团”重回正轨
this long to get us back in the game.

939
01:37:20,355 --> 01:37:24,304
阿勒莱恩等人会见的那人叫波利亚科夫
The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov.

940
01:37:26,902 --> 01:37:29,691
你以为他的角色就是

941
01:37:29,823 --> 01:37:31,898
从“巫术”带情报给你
You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you.

942
01:37:32,033 --> 01:37:36,908
其实他真正的任务是从“鼹鼠”那里接收情报
His real role is to receive information from the mole

943
01:37:37,037 --> 01:37:38,616
然后带回给卡拉
to take back to Karla.

944
01:37:39,999 --> 01:37:43,368
这… 不可能
That, er... that's not possible.

945
01:37:43,503 --> 01:37:45,164
可你让这变可能了
Made possible.

946
01:37:45,298 --> 01:37:48,714
就发生在那栋由你说服财政部来买单的房子里
By you in the House which you persuaded the Treasury to pay for.

947
01:37:49,593 --> 01:37:54,800
“巫术”的情报是确凿的，重要至极
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine. It's been gold.

948
01:37:54,932 --> 01:37:59,227
很小部分有价值罢了
It's just enough glitter amongst the chicken feed.

949
01:37:59,354 --> 01:38:02,226
老总不相信什么奇迹或者巫术
Control didn't believe in miracles or in Witchcraft.

950
01:38:02,358 --> 01:38:04,147
但贪婪又懒惰的你们
But you were lazy and you were greedy,

951
01:38:04,275 --> 01:38:08,319
把他挤出“马戏团”，将卡拉引狼入室
and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.

952
01:38:11,032 --> 01:38:15,244
你们与美国佬协商交换情报
You opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans.

953
01:38:15,371 --> 01:38:19,035
美国佬告诉“马戏团”的，也会泄露给俄国
What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin.

954
01:38:19,165 --> 01:38:24,623
所谓“巫术”情报，不过是卡拉给你的垃圾情报
Witchcraft's information, the "gold" Karla let you have,

955
01:38:24,755 --> 01:38:26,878
不是在钓你
it wasn't to lure you.

956
01:38:27,008 --> 01:38:29,298
而是在钓美国佬
It was to lure the Americans.

957
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:33,171
现在
Now,

958
01:38:33,305 --> 01:38:35,382
你还觉得自己立了大功么？
do you want to take credit for that?

959
01:38:39,897 --> 01:38:41,771
我们该怎么做？
What can we do?

960
01:38:44,192 --> 01:38:47,975
我们有一件“鼹鼠”想要的东西
We have one thing the mole wants.

961
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,528
- 如果我去巴黎…
- 你必须去
- If I go to Paris...  - You'll go.

962
01:38:52,659 --> 01:38:55,447
如果我去巴黎
If I go to Paris,

963
01:38:57,207 --> 01:38:59,698
我要你保证你会把依瑞纳弄回来
I want your word that you will get Irina back.

964
01:39:01,253 --> 01:39:04,835
我不管你们用谁交易，我不管
I don't care who you have to trade. And I am out.

965
01:39:07,383 --> 01:39:11,631
我想要个安稳的家，谢谢，我可不想落下你们这样的下场
I want a family, thank you. I do not want to end up like you lot.

966
01:39:11,764 --> 01:39:14,090
你要把她弄回来
You will get her back.

967
01:39:16,976 --> 01:39:19,469
我尽力，里基
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

968
01:39:44,507 --> 01:39:46,582
你好，乔治
Oh, hello, George.

969
01:39:47,759 --> 01:39:49,218
你好
Hello.

970
01:40:15,163 --> 01:40:17,571
跟我谈谈忠诚吧，托比
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

971
01:40:20,586 --> 01:40:23,587
是老总将你招致麾下的，没错吧？
Control recruited you, didn't he?

972
01:40:23,715 --> 01:40:26,883
他在维也纳一个博物馆发现饥寒交迫的你
Found you starving in a museum in Vienna.

973
01:40:27,011 --> 01:40:29,500
还被通缉
A wanted man.

974
01:40:29,636 --> 01:40:31,714
我听说，他救了你的命
Saved your life, I heard.

975
01:40:32,848 --> 01:40:35,007
但在关键时刻
And yet when the time came,

976
01:40:35,142 --> 01:40:37,515
要你在老总和阿勒莱恩之间做选择的时候
when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline,

977
01:40:37,646 --> 01:40:39,603
你毫不犹豫选择了阿勒莱恩
you didn't hesitate.

978
01:40:40,649 --> 01:40:44,397
可以理解，可能是你的战争经历作祟
That's understandable, perhaps, with your war experience.

979
01:40:44,527 --> 01:40:49,274
你能活这么久，我想是因为你那善于改换阵营的能力
You survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides.

980
01:40:49,408 --> 01:40:51,484
有奶就是娘
Serve any master.

981
01:40:57,126 --> 01:40:59,829
这是怎么回事，什么状况，乔治？
What? What's... What's this about, George?

982
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:04,170
关于你投靠哪边的主子，托比
It's about which master you've been serving, Toby.

983
01:41:08,179 --> 01:41:10,752
情报在泄漏，托比
Intelligence has been leaked, Toby.

984
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:13,758
有人在偷“马戏团”的内部资料
Someone's been taking files from the Circus.

985
01:41:13,891 --> 01:41:16,134
不不不
No, no, no, no. No.

986
01:41:16,269 --> 01:41:18,013
这是个误会，误解
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.

987
01:41:18,146 --> 01:41:21,563
文件传递给了俄国专员，对不对？
Files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?

988
01:41:21,693 --> 01:41:22,855
是的
Yes.

989
01:41:24,696 --> 01:41:27,400
是的，我传递的
And, yes, I delivered them.

990
01:41:32,913 --> 01:41:35,202
但是珀西•阿勒莱恩也参与了
But so did Percy Alleline.

991
01:41:40,088 --> 01:41:41,366
好狗
Good boy.

992
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,581
比尔•海顿也有份
Bill Haydon.

993
01:41:45,341 --> 01:41:47,417
罗伊•布兰德也有份
And so did Roy Bland.

994
01:41:57,229 --> 01:41:59,720
眼见不一定为实，乔治
Things aren't always what they seem, George.

995
01:41:59,856 --> 01:42:01,815
你应该知道
You should know that.

996
01:42:01,943 --> 01:42:04,399
俄方认为波利亚科夫…
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...

997
01:42:08,618 --> 01:42:10,608
在为其效力
working for them.

998
01:42:10,743 --> 01:42:13,282
我们时不时的给些没用的文件让他回去交差
Every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them.

999
01:42:13,413 --> 01:42:15,821
小部分有价值的也只是为了麻痹他的上司
Chicken feed, just to keep his bosses happy.

1000
01:42:18,253 --> 01:42:21,502
但波利亚科夫是我们的人
But Polyakov's our Joe.

1001
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:25,330
- 他是这项大行动的一分子
- “巫术”行动
- He's a part of a big operation.  - Operation Witchcraft.

1002
01:42:26,301 --> 01:42:27,795
我知道
Yes, I know.

1003
01:42:28,804 --> 01:42:30,464
乔治
George.

1004
01:42:30,598 --> 01:42:33,433
- 我不该被这样对待
- 谁让你捎信给吉姆•普里多
- Please, I don't deserve this.  - Who gave you the message

1005
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,265
让其忘掉锅匠、裁缝这档子事的？
for Jim Prideaux to forget about Tinker, Tailor?

1006
01:42:36,397 --> 01:42:38,685
- 布兰德
- 是谁炒掉康妮•萨克斯的呢？
- Bland.  - To get rid of Connie Sachs?

1007
01:42:38,816 --> 01:42:40,558
- 还有杰瑞•韦斯特比？
- 布兰德
- Westerby?  - Bland.

1008
01:42:40,692 --> 01:42:42,898
或海顿
Or Haydon.

1009
01:42:43,027 --> 01:42:44,820
我不知道，但一定是他们其中之一
I don't know. One of them.

1010
01:42:46,073 --> 01:42:47,947
也可能是珀西
Or maybe Percy. No.

1011
01:42:48,075 --> 01:42:50,781
好吧，我不知道是谁
Well, I don't know who.

1012
01:42:50,913 --> 01:42:53,119
你只是信使
You're just the messenger.

1013
01:42:54,206 --> 01:42:56,828
在他们之间跑腿
Running between them all.

1014
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,414
传递一切围绕巫术行动的情报
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

1015
01:43:00,713 --> 01:43:03,086
你知道的我都知道
I know all about your secret source.

1016
01:43:04,843 --> 01:43:06,919
你不知道的，我也知道
And I know something you don't.

1017
01:43:08,929 --> 01:43:11,088
我知道谁是幕后人
I know who he is.

1018
01:43:13,477 --> 01:43:15,553
是卡拉
He's Karla.

1019
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:27,698
你们中有人给了波利亚科夫很重要的情报
One of you has been giving Polyakov the crown jewels. 

1020
01:43:27,825 --> 01:43:30,993
- 我不知道
- 你还是被通缉的人吧，托比？
- I did not know.  - Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

1021
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:34,989
- 听着，乔治，我不知道…
- 你站错队了
- Look, George, I didn't know. I...  - You picked the wrong side.

1022
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:36,999
不，你得相信我
No, you've got to believe me.

1023
01:43:37,126 --> 01:43:39,451
乔治，求你
George, please.

1024
01:43:43,592 --> 01:43:45,750
我很忠诚
I am loyal.

1025
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:48,838
我...我忠心耿耿
I... I am loyal.

1026
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:02,357
不要…不要把我送回去
Don't... Don't... Don't send me back.

1027
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:04,362
求你，乔治
Please, George.

1028
01:44:05,241 --> 01:44:06,983
不要把我送回去
Don't send me back.

1029
01:44:12,497 --> 01:44:14,574
给我那个地址
Give me the address.

1030
01:44:17,795 --> 01:44:20,204
你们在哪儿与波利亚科夫接头？
Where do you meet Polyakov?

1031
01:44:33,771 --> 01:44:36,094
嘿嘿！狗狗，安静
Hey, hey! Dog, dog, be quiet!

1032
01:44:37,232 --> 01:44:40,019
这是做什么？你是谁？
What is this? Who are you?

1033
01:44:40,152 --> 01:44:41,773
- 麦克格雷女士？
- 正是

1034
01:44:41,783 --> 01:44:43,842
- Mrs Crave?  - Yes?

1035
01:44:57,753 --> 01:45:00,162
- 安全信号是什么？
- 排气孔
- What are the safety signals?  - The air vent.

1036
01:45:00,299 --> 01:45:02,706
打开代表安全，关闭代表不便入内
Open and all's well, closed and you're not to enter.

1037
01:45:06,262 --> 01:45:08,551
麦克风呢？
And the microphone?

1038
01:45:15,482 --> 01:45:16,858
彼得？
Peter?

1039
01:45:33,457 --> 01:45:36,458
男孩站在燃烧的甲板上/只有他逃了出来
The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled;

1040
01:45:36,585 --> 01:45:38,994
火焰照亮了遍野的残骸/照亮了头顶的天际
The flame that lit the battle's wreck shone brightly o'er the dead.

1041
01:45:39,965 --> 01:45:43,382
他勇敢且骄傲地昂首挺立/仿佛要控制整个风暴
Yet beautiful and bright he stood as born to rule the storm;

1042
01:45:43,511 --> 01:45:46,762
鲜活的生灵/虽然是个孩子，但却骄傲地活着
A creature of heroic blood, a proud, though childlike form

1043
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:49,558
火焰翻滚着…
The flames roll'd on...

1044
01:46:00,555 --> 01:46:03,467
Merci. Au revoir.

1045
01:46:36,816 --> 01:46:38,358
继续
Go on.

1046
01:46:46,284 --> 01:46:48,277
整个局里都在搜捕你
The whole service is looking for you.

1047
01:46:48,411 --> 01:46:51,781
- 他们逮住你会活剥了你
- 也许我就想让他们发现我呢
- They'll skin you alive if they find you.  - Maybe I want them to find me.

1048
01:46:53,501 --> 01:46:56,705
你可以走了，留下册子，把钥匙留在机器上
You can go now. Leave the books and put the keys in the machines.

1049
01:46:56,839 --> 01:46:59,460
不，本你留下
No, Ben stays here.

1050
01:46:59,592 --> 01:47:04,965
里基•塔尔声称持有关于情报局内部安全的重要信息
Ricki Tarr claims to have information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

1051
01:47:27,245 --> 01:47:29,118
史迈利先生？
Mr Smiley? 

1052
01:47:31,624 --> 01:47:33,035
的士快到了“马戏团”了
Taxi approaching Circus.

1053
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:46,890
“锅匠”
Tinker.

1054
01:47:57,778 --> 01:47:59,568
“裁缝”
Tailor.

1055
01:48:04,868 --> 01:48:06,611
这是“士兵”
Here comes Soldier.

1056
01:48:11,376 --> 01:48:12,998
到齐了
Full house.

1057
01:48:25,807 --> 01:48:31,596
- 大声读出来
- “阿勒莱恩给塔尔的私信
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.  - Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

1058
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:37,109
“满足你的要求前需解释说明
Require clarification before meeting your request.

1059
01:48:38,154 --> 01:48:44,238
“引文，关系‘马戏团’安危的重要情报，结束引文…
Quote, information vital to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote

1060
01:48:45,535 --> 01:48:49,783
“太笼统，请发送具体情报”
does not qualify, send further information.

1061
01:48:49,916 --> 01:48:53,037
哈，就这样，珀西，你继续拖吧
Ah! That's it, Percy, you keep stalling.

1062
01:48:53,170 --> 01:48:56,003
我警告你，本，我们中间真的有内鬼
I warn you, Ben. We've got some really lousy people in this outfit.

1063
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:58,337
我他妈谁都不信
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

1064
01:49:06,225 --> 01:49:08,431
会谈结束
The meeting's over.

1065
01:49:10,853 --> 01:49:12,763
他们在离场
They're leaving.

1066
01:50:34,456 --> 01:50:37,456
如果我们被打搅的话要编个什么故事？

1067
01:50:41,456 --> 01:50:46,456
好的，关掉了么？检查下，好么？

1068
01:50:52,957 --> 01:50:56,457
确保由你亲自（与塔尔）接头

1069
01:50:56,957 --> 01:50:59,457
我们必须在十英里外拦截住塔尔

1070
01:50:59,957 --> 01:51:02,456
然后转移走

1071
01:51:23,957 --> 01:51:27,457
我是外交使节团的

1072
01:51:27,957 --> 01:51:32,456
你们这帮二货无论谁来，都最好牢牢记住这一点！

1073
01:51:34,456 --> 01:51:36,056
你该高兴才对

1074
01:51:36,456 --> 01:51:39,457
莫斯科可能会授予勋章且奖励公寓给你

1075
01:51:39,957 --> 01:51:42,958
我才是那个被流放到西伯利亚去的倒霉鬼

1076
01:53:14,153 --> 01:53:16,360
科拉道克斯说几天后就把我送走
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

1077
01:53:18,156 --> 01:53:23,905
我还在想自己在莫斯科会有多想念板球
（意指“马戏团”和俄国人做了某种交易，将放他回莫斯科）
I keep thinking how much I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.

1078
01:53:28,627 --> 01:53:33,087
我希望你能帮我打理点事
I was rather hoping you might do a little light housekeeping for me.

1079
01:53:34,883 --> 01:53:36,544
尽量
If I can.

1080
01:53:37,303 --> 01:53:41,881
有个姑娘，给她些钱，好吗？
There's a girl. Give her some money, would you?

1081
01:53:42,016 --> 01:53:44,224
编个故事
And give her a good cover story.

1082
01:53:46,478 --> 01:53:49,265
如果能让她好过些，告诉她我爱她
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1083
01:53:49,398 --> 01:53:51,141
就这么多
It's all there.

1084
01:53:51,275 --> 01:53:55,320
还有个男孩，给他点钱让他闭嘴
And there's a boy, too. Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1085
01:53:57,657 --> 01:54:01,701
我知道审问官们的伎俩，大多是我教的
I know the inquisitors' bag of tricks. I taught most of them.

1086
01:54:04,373 --> 01:54:06,449
不过是你来我往而已
It's just a reaction.

1087
01:54:08,377 --> 01:54:10,916
或者说是逢场作戏也可
An over-reaction, if you like.

1088
01:54:11,047 --> 01:54:13,717
我的确还有一两个问题
I did have one or two questions.

1089
01:54:17,595 --> 01:54:19,469
- 关于普里多
- 天哪
- About Prideaux.  - Goddamn it!

1090
01:54:19,597 --> 01:54:22,515
- 是我把他救回来的，不是吗？
- 是的
- I got him back, didn't I?  - Yes, yes, you did.

1091
01:54:22,643 --> 01:54:24,600
你办的好事
That's good of you.

1092
01:54:25,687 --> 01:54:28,936
我惊讶的是卡拉没把他毙了
I am surprised Karla didn't have him shot.

1093
01:54:30,482 --> 01:54:33,235
或者你觉得他之所以没痛下杀手
Or do you think he held back,

1094
01:54:33,361 --> 01:54:35,935
是为了照顾你的小情绪？
out of delicacy towards you?

1095
01:54:39,619 --> 01:54:44,244
普里多在去匈牙利前有没有见过你？
Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1096
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:49,123
事实上，见过
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1097
01:54:51,756 --> 01:54:53,796
说什么了？
To say what?

1098
01:54:59,263 --> 01:55:01,138
他是去警告你吧
To warn you.

1099
01:55:03,059 --> 01:55:05,632
因为他的直觉告诉他
Because he knew deep down

1100
01:55:06,855 --> 01:55:08,765
内奸一直都是你
it was you all along.

1101
01:55:13,319 --> 01:55:15,608
你也觉得是我吧
So did you.

1102
01:55:19,619 --> 01:55:22,026
我不得不选一边，乔治
I had to pick a side, George.

1103
01:55:23,707 --> 01:55:26,991
品位的选择多过于道德的选择
It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one.

1104
01:55:28,378 --> 01:55:31,414
西方变得丑陋无比
And the West has become so very ugly.

1105
01:55:32,591 --> 01:55:34,300
你不觉得吗？
Don't you think?

1106
01:55:36,012 --> 01:55:39,595
卡拉有没有考虑过让你接手“马戏团”？
Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?

1107
01:55:39,724 --> 01:55:42,047
我又不是他该死的办公室小白脸！
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1108
01:55:42,183 --> 01:55:44,675
那你以为你是什么，比尔？
What are you, then, Bill?

1109
01:55:51,319 --> 01:55:53,608
我是个建功立业的人
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1110
01:56:07,337 --> 01:56:11,997
有什么要我转告给安的吗？
Is there anything particular you want me to pass on to Ann?

1111
01:56:15,761 --> 01:56:20,305
那不是针对你个人的，乔治，我希望你能理解
Oh, that was nothing personal, George. I hope you understand that.

1112
01:56:20,433 --> 01:56:22,722
卡拉说你是个厉害的角色
Karla said you were good,

1113
01:56:22,852 --> 01:56:26,018
是我们重点防范的对象
the one we had to worry about.

1114
01:56:26,146 --> 01:56:29,599
不过你确实还有一根软肋
But you do have a blind spot.

1115
01:56:29,734 --> 01:56:32,107
他推测如果我成了安人尽皆知的情人的话
He reckoned if I was known to be Ann's lover,

1116
01:56:33,488 --> 01:56:36,490
你反而不会那么容易看清我
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

1117
01:56:38,078 --> 01:56:39,949
事实证明他对了
And he was right.

1118
01:56:41,372 --> 01:56:43,329
在一定程度上
Up to a point.

1119
01:56:46,837 --> 01:56:48,628
在一定程度上
Up to a point.

1120
01:57:15,825 --> 01:57:17,782
先生，我帮你做了这个
I made this for you, sir.

1121
01:57:26,585 --> 01:57:29,705
我不想再见到你在这无所事事
I don't want you hanging around here any more.

1122
01:57:31,508 --> 01:57:33,715
从今往后，离我远一点
Keep away from me from now on.

1123
01:57:35,095 --> 01:57:37,668
- 去加入其他同学们
- 可是…
- Go and join the others.  - But...

1124
01:57:37,805 --> 01:57:40,723
就...你就他妈的跟你的同学玩去，好吗？
Just... Just bloody join in, will you?

1125
01:57:44,397 --> 01:57:46,935
去玩吧，真该死！
Go and play, damn you!

1126
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:07,128
你能去检查下么，杰瑞？
Could you check, Jerry?

1127
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:25,880
