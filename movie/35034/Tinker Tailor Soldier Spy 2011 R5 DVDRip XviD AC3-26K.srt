1
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,073
You weren't followed?

2
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,359
No.

3
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,232
Better come in.

4
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,153
Trust no one, Jim.

5
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,236
Especially not in the mainstream.

6
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,919
Sit down.

7
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,798
I understand you still have
one Hungarian identity running?

8
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,153
I do.

9
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,351
I want you to go to Budapest.

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,200
'This is not above board.

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,276
'Nobody else knows.

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,190
'They're after my head, Jim boy.

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,472
'Do you understand?

14
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,112
'I have had an offer of service.

15
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,516
'A Hungarian general
wants to come over.

16
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,876
'I would like you to meet him.'

17
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,991
He has some information
that I need, Jim.

18
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,991
What information?

19
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,313
Treasure.

20
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,794
'He has the name of the mole

21
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,435
'the Russians have planted
in the British intelligence service

22
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,358
'right at the top of the Circus.

23
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,756
'There's a rotten apple, Jim.

24
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,871
'We have to find it.'

25
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,518
Stop!

26
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,276
Would you witness this for me?

27
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,994
I wish I could done more, Control.

28
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,554
You did all you could, Percy.

29
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,031
Well, a man should know
when to leave the party.

30
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,156
What about Smiley?

31
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,355
Smiley is leaving with me.

32
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,952
You little prick, Esterhase.

33
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,310
Gentlemen, shall we start?

34
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,358
Under Secretary Lacon
is ready for you, Sir Percy.

35
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,633
The Treasury don't understand.

36
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,832
Why can't the intelligence service
simply put in a request

37
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,473
for a general increase in funding

38
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,398
and then you account
for the spend on your special operation?

39
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,119
Operation Witchcraft
needs to remain secret.

40
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,073
- It's a fiefdom of its own.
- Yes, that's what's worrying us.

41
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,714
The whole thing's
very unaccountable, isn't it?

42
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,835
And this London house
that nobody knows the address of,

43
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,518
is that really necessary?

44
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,871
Now more than ever.
We need to protect our Soviet source.

45
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,549
So where do you propose we meet?
In a café?

46
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,274
The rent and rates on this house
have doubled.

47
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,359
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

48
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,233
We're asking
for a few thousand for a house.

49
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,237
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

50
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,032
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

51
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,593
Look, nobody underestimates

52
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,234
the importance of the job
you chaps are doing.

53
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,555
But what happened
in Budapest last year,

54
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,272
that was a disaster.

55
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,231
With respect, sir,

56
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,272
it wasn't one of your civil servants
that got killed, was it?

57
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,709
Now this isn't about soldiers
in trenches any more.

58
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,035
- We're the front line now...
- Roy!

59
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,391
For 25 years we've been the only thing
standing between them and Karla

60
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,670
and Moscow
and the third bloody world war.

61
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,758
Look, the Minister's very pleased
with your progress so far.

62
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,432
He's less pleased, though,

63
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,028
with the lack of progress
with our American cousins.

64
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,993
You see,

65
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,111
in their eyes,

66
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,549
you're still a leaky ship.

67
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,990
Yes?

68
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,032
'Someone on the line for you, sir.
Seems urgent.'

69
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,832
All right, well put him through.

70
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,830
- Hello?
- 'Is this Under Secretary Lacon?'

71
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,234
Yes.

72
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,476
My name's Ricki Tarr.

73
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,836
- 'What do you want?'
- I need to meet you.

74
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,276
If you need to confirm who I am,
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

75
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,072
Peter Guillam.

76
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,714
But only Guillam, no one else.

77
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,199
You got clearance for that?

78
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,073
Well, I'm not bloody
chaining it up outside.

79
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,714
Mind you, no better off in here
with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

80
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,308
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

81
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,830
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse
of the new girl before Bland gets to her.

82
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,157
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

83
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,236
- Has he seen her yet?
- Of course he has.

84
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,998
Came down first thing this morning.

85
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,758
Belinda.

86
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,272
- Peter Guillam.
- 'Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

87
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,868
'Just ringing to find out...

88
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,310
'So Winston
Churchill saved your life, Edie.'

89
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,000
'I was working in the kitchen,
getting dinner ready.

90
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,758
'And he was late, you see.'

91
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,155
- 'During a raid?'
- 'During a raid, you see.'

92
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,032
'He said,
"Why aren't you in that shelter?"'

93
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,639
- 'Why weren't you?'
- 'Well, because...'

94
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,676
I was sorry to hear
about Control, Mr. Smiley.

95
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,318
'He said Tarr called him
from a phone box.'

96
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,673
He said there's a mole,

97
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,949
right at the top of the Circus,

98
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,549
that he's been there for years.

99
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,992
It does mean

100
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,918
you're rather well placed
to look into this matter for us now,

101
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,031
doesn't it?

102
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,712
Outside the family.

103
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,830
I'm retired, Oliver.

104
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,030
You fired me.

105
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,957
The thing is,

106
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,957
some time ago before Control died,

107
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,514
he came to me
with a similar suggestion.

108
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,791
That there is a mole.

109
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,830
He never mentioned
his suspicions to you?

110
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,149
No.

111
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,716
Oh, I just thought that
as you were his man, so to speak...

112
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,115
What did you say to him?

113
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,879
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia
had rather gotten the better of him

114
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,878
and he was going to pull
his whole house down.

115
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,991
That bloody mess in Budapest.

116
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,151
Damn it, George.

117
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,236
It's your generation, your legacy.

118
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,833
I would have thought, if there's
any truth in it, you'd want to...

119
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,557
I'll keep Peter.

120
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,117
And there's a retired
Special Branch man, Mendel.

121
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,231
I should like to have him.

122
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,511
Lift up.

123
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,232
And quickly down again.

124
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,436
There's a place I know, sir.
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

125
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,037
Be careful with it. Please.
It's Georgian.

126
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,789
My friend wants peace and quiet
in order to work, Mrs. Pope Graham.

127
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,989
No disturbances.

128
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,308
Her real name is just Graham.

129
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,476
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

130
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,518
'Peter, did you get the keys
to Control's flat?'

131
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,757
♪ And did those feet in ancient time

132
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,998
♪ Walk upon England's
mountains green ?

133
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,629
Oh!

134
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,269
'George!'

135
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,639
George, get in here!

136
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,631
George.

137
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,230
Sit down.

138
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,390
Take a look at this nonsense.

139
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,673
Report by Soviet high command

140
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,509
on their recent naval exercises
in the Black Sea.

141
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,154
Just what the admiralty
has been begging us

142
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,918
for some information on.

143
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,151
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't.

144
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,111
Percy and his little cabal
walked in with it.

145
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,231
- Look, Control...
- Shut up.

146
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,235
Style appalling.

147
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,238
Patently a fabrication
from beginning to end.

148
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,319
- Just could be the real thing.
- Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

149
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,999
But its topicality makes it suspect.

150
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,271
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

151
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,119
Where did it come from?
What's the access?

152
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,196
A new secret source of mine.

153
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,912
But how could he
possibly have access?

154
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,077
He has access to the most sensitive
levels of policy-making.

155
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,438
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

156
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,358
Oh, Percy and his pals
bypassed us, Smiley.

157
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,596
Gone straight to the minister.

158
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,793
Percy has been allowed to keep
the identity of his new friend

159
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,319
top secret.

160
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,876
The minister agrees too many secrets
are blown around here.

161
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,831
Too much failure,
too many scandals.

162
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,157
- Too little solid intelligence.
- Percy does have a point, Control.

163
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,840
We should be fighting Communism,
not each other.

164
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,554
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation,
our partners.

165
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,908
Your bloody Yanks!

166
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,349
We've had enough!
There's going to be changes.

167
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,109
We need to decide if want to be
part of the past or part of the future.

168
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,232
I should have left you
where I found you.

169
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,316
- Look!
- Control...

170
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,112
Out, all of you!

171
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,157
If Witchcraft is genuine...

172
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,475
Nothing is genuine any more.

173
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,033
George...

174
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,792
Do you want me to get
this stuff over to the hotel?

175
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,236
Thank you. Er, anywhere will do.

176
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,439
- Peter?
- Hm?

177
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,835
I need you to do something for me.

178
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,957
I'd like you to go to the Circus.

179
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,438
'In the cabinet
at the duty officers' station

180
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,710
'are records of staff recently retired.

181
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,631
'I'd like photographs of them

182
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,958
'and of the diagram of the Circus's
reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

183
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,594
'along with a list of all payments
made from the Reptile fund.'

184
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,516
- Help you with anything, Bill?
- I was just looking for his Majesty.

185
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,710
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

186
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,793
Oh.

187
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,399
- Heard you had an accident, Peter.
- Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

188
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,114
When are you going
to get some new furniture up here?

189
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,230
I'll have a word with Esterhase.
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.

190
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,637
- Where are you off to?
- Lunch.

191
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,672
Want some company?

192
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,636
According to the personnel files,

193
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,318
seven were due for retirement anyway.

194
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,556
Another four don't seem
particularly mysterious.

195
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,558
Jerry Westerby was dismissed
December 4.

196
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,477
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

197
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,637
That's just two weeks
after you and Control were forced out.

198
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,559
- Return to Oxford, please.
- That's 1. 1 5.

199
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,238
Percy has always resisted
any proposal

200
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,989
of a wider exploitation
of Witchcraft's intelligence.

201
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,917
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

202
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,759
I've refused to share Witchcraft
with our allies so far, Minister.

203
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,838
Greedy boy.

204
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,270
My goal has been to establish
its track record beyond all doubt.

205
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,875
I think the time has come to approach
our American brothers-in-arms.

206
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,199
- Will they take us back into bed?
- I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

207
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,632
I want on-going access
to American intelligence.

208
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,273
You think we can get it?

209
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,029
With Witchcraft on our side, we can
get anything we bloody well want.

210
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,559
Fine.

211
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,549
Carry on.

212
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,119
Thank you.

213
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,594
And I strike thee down...

214
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,309
Oh, I, er...

215
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,072
Not supposed to.
Doctor's orders.

216
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,551
Wicked, wicked George.

217
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,557
I don't know about you, George,

218
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,114
but I feel seriously under-fucked.

219
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,876
I heard Ann left you again.

220
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,470
She doesn't deserve you, George,
not one hair on your head.

221
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,718
You left the Circus
shortly after I retired.

222
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,151
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

223
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,955
Chucked out on the rubbish heap,
like you.

224
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,069
Why?

225
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,395
'Polyakov.

226
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,277
'Do you remember him?'

227
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,471
'From the Soviet Embassy?'

228
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,388
'Alexsey Polyakov,
cultural attaché here in London.

229
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,599
'When he arrived here 1 5 years ago,
I requested he be checked out.

230
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,235
'He was graded whiter than white.
Didn't put a foot wrong.'

231
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,311
'But you disagreed?'

232
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,158
'There's a story
you must have heard

233
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,113
'that Karla has set up a secret cell.

234
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,117
'The personnel are all ex-military,

235
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,153
'trained to handle
deep-penetration agents, moles.'

236
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,953
'There are always stories,
Connie.'

237
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,514
'But what if this story was true?

238
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,029
'One night in research
I saw something, George.

239
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,516
'There was our friend Polyakov
at a May day parade in Berlin

240
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,108
'receiving a salute.'

241
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,913
'Why would you salute
a cultural attaché?'

242
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,589
'Exactly.
Unless he was a war veteran himself.'

243
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,315
And if he was, why hide the fact?

244
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,998
What did you do?

245
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,634
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

246
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,830
Here.

247
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,191
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood
if ever I saw one.

248
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,356
If he's here, it must be
because he's running a mole.

249
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,471
You're to leave Polyakov alone.

250
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,636
You're becoming obsessed with him.

251
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,558
- You're losing your sense of proportion.
- But that's ridiculous.

252
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,672
Perhaps it's time
you went out into the real world.

253
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,514
What does it matter?
Old Circus is gone anyway.

254
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,556
Here we are.

255
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,671
The Nursery in our day.

256
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,597
Jim Prideaux.

257
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,156
And Bill Haydon.
Together, of course.

258
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,552
The Inseparables.

259
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,636
There's Control himself.

260
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,312
All my boys.

261
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,235
All my lovely boys.

262
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,070
That was a good time, George.

263
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,556
It was the war, Connie.

264
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,550
A real war.

265
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,750
Englishmen could be proud then.

266
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,395
So I was right, then?

267
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,750
About Polyakov.

268
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,632
There is a mole.

269
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,355
If it's bad, don't come back.
I want to remember you all as you were.

270
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,514
Percy?
Percy, did you mix this?

271
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,397
Aye, I did so.

272
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,035
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

273
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,197
Can you nae learn
to take a bloody order?

274
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,312
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

275
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,158
- I followed the recipe.
- Come on.

276
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,317
It'll take us five hours
to get drunk on this monkey's piss.

277
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,155
♪ He's not the first

- Hm?

293
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,271
You been up all night?

294
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,959
Yes.

295
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,639
What's this?

296
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,390
Request for £1,000 in cash
from the Reptile fund.

297
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,670
To a Mr. Ellis.

298
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,234
It was one of Jim Prideaux's
work names.

299
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,073
Prideaux was killed
in Hungary a year ago.

300
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,633
October 21.

301
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,394
So why was someone giving him
£1,000 two months later?

302
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,191
I wonder where he is then, sir.

303
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,073
Settle down now.

304
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,990
- Hand those out.
- Sir.

305
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,917
What is it?
The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?

306
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,434
The bells, the bells!

307
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,277
Ohh!

308
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,034
Come here.

309
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,591
- What's your name?
- Roach. Bill Roach, sir.

310
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,234
- I'm a new boy.
- New arrival, eh?

311
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,352
- What's the story?
- My mother and father.

312
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,273
My father left, so...

313
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,674
Hm.

314
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,117
Bill.

315
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,878
The unpaid Bill.

316
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,232
- Anyone ever call you that?
- No, sir.

317
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,351
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

318
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,396
They've all been good 'uns.

319
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,312
What are you good at?

320
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,919
Nothing, sir.

321
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,759

- Who is?
- Your lot.

I need you to get her back off Karla.

- Hm.

Thank you, Bryant.

Fine. Need to go
up to the registry today.

OK, sir.

499

a yellow one for the bag, sir.

I'll need your chit, Mr. Guillam.

Percy would like
quite an urgent word with you.

543

If you can come now to the fifth floor
that would be so kind.

544
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,993
Yes, of course.

545
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,873
Throw that into the lift for me.

546
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,434
Send it to the second floor,
save me filling out bloody chits.

547
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,118
Will do, sir.

So what have you been getting up to
down there these days?

549
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,475
Apart from chasing our virgins.

550
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,752
A couple of Arab ploys
that look quite promising.

551
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,990
Apart from that,
I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

552
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,872
Arabs.

553
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,514
You can rent one but you can't buy one.
Right, Bill?

554
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,594
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

555
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,518
Fine. We have tea
at Fortnum's every afternoon.

556
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,918
I require the matter
of your discussion with Tarr.

557
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,110
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

558
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,477
What's that shrug for?

559
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,151
I'm talking to you about the traitor

560
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,636
who cut the throat
of our man in Istanbul.

561
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,911
I'm talking to you about a defector
from your own damn section.

562
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,794
I'm accusing you of consorting
with an enemy agent behind my back.

563
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,195
Don't damn well shrug at me!

564
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,151
How would you like a term in prison?

565
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,399
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

566
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,475
So get your facts straight
and get off my back!

567
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,275
So... if I told you
Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

568
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,152
would you be surprised?

569
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,316
No, nothing would surprise me
about Ricki Tarr.

570
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,994
And if I told you we happen to know
£30,000 mysteriously appeared

571
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,315
in his bank account last month,

572
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,670
would that surprise you?

573
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,560
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

574
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,956
Turned by the opposition months ago
and now they've sent him back to us.

575
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,753
- What for?
- Never mind what for.

576
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,269
To muddy the water,
that's what for.

577
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,188
To spread a whole lot of damn
nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

578
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,673
The point is this.

579
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,279
He's heading for home.

580
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,436
The first peep from him,
you come to the grown-ups.

581
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,198
Understood?

582
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,676
Anyone you see around this table
but not another damn soul.

583
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,953
Get out.

584

Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

He's been telling us
all about his adventures.

He's a double, George.

There is no mole. Whole thing's
been thought up by Moscow.

601
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,236
Karla bought him for £30,000.

602
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,113
I stole that because of you.

603
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,710
I spied on my own because of him.
Do you know how that makes me feel?

604
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,034
Ricki...

605
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,596
you said you sent the Circus a telegram
concerning Irina's information.

606
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,597
- That's right.
- What was the date?

607
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,597
He doesn't know
because there was no telegram.

608
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,110
- The whole thing is a fabrication.
- 20th November.

609
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,152
It must have been 20th November.
Evening.

610
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,748
'Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre

611
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,269
'everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

612
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,995
- 'She told me Karla...'
- November 20th is missing.

613
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,954
Someone is covering their tracks,
unless of course you think

614
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,911
that's just a coincidence?

615
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,353
What about the money?

616
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,234
30,000 isn't so much for Karla
to pay if it protects his mole.

617
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,389
I'm afraid someone in the Circus
knows all about Mr. Tarr

618
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,320
and is doing everything they can
to discredit him.

'...everything the Circus thinks
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.'

620
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,999
Why didn't you tell me
that you had Tarr?

621
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,550
In case I never made it
out of the Circus.

622
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,797
I should get some rest.

623
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,475
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

624
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,393
Come up.

625
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,797
I met him once.

626
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,639
Karla.

627
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,559
In '55.

628
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,795
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

629
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,792
Purge after purge.

630
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,195
Half their agents were jumping ship.

631
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,716
I travelled around, signing them up.

632
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,599
Hundreds of them.

633
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,839
One of them
was calling himself Gerstmann.

634
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,870
He was on his way back to Russia

635
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,310
and we were pretty sure
he was going to be executed.

636
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,752
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi
and that's how long I had

637
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,872
to convince him to come over to us

638
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,991
instead of going home to die.

639
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,118
There's a little room.

640
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,990
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

641
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,750
The Americans had had him tortured.

642
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,671
He had no fingernails.

643
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,276
It's incredibly hot.

644
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,712
I'm very tired and all I want to do
is get this over with and get back home.

645
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,829
Things weren't going well with Ann.

646
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,238
I give him the usual pitch.

647
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,239
"Come to the West
and we can give you a comfortable life,

648
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,197
"after questioning."

649
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,758
What did he say?

650
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,432
"Think of your wife.

651
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,076
"You have a wife, don't you?

652
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,238
"Here. I brought you some cigarettes,
by the way.

653
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,798
"Use my lighter.

654
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,789
"We could arrange for her to join you.
We have a lot of stock to trade.

655
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,791
"If you go back, she'll be ostracised.
Think of her.

656
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,558
"Think about..."

657
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,558
I kept on...

658
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,110
...harping on about the damn wife,

659
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,556
telling him more about me than...

660
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,991
I should have walked out, of course.

661
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,318
But for some reason it seemed
important to save this one, so I go on.

662
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,719
"We're not so very different you and I.

663
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,873
"We've both spent our lives

664
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,231
"looking for the weaknesses
in one another's systems.

665
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,390
"Don't you think it's time to recognise

666
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,798
"there is as little worth on your side
as there is on mine?"

667
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,351
Never said a word.

668
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,392
Not one word.

669
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,794
And the next morning
he got back on his plane.

670
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,913
He handed the pack of cigarettes
back to me, untouched.

671
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,919
This was a chain-smoker, mind.

672
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,033
And he flew off to what
he presumed would be his death.

673
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,551
He kept my lighter.

674
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,872
It was a gift.

675
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,071
"To George from Ann.

676
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,192
"All my love."

677
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,832
That was Karla.

678
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,594
He went back to die
rather than giving in.

679
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,999
Yes, and that's how I know
he can be beaten.

680
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,911
Because he's a fanatic.

681
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:08,115
And the fanatic is always
concealing a secret doubt.

682
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,238
What did he look like?

683
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,277
I can't remember.

684
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,036
After today, Peter,

685
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,795
you have to assume
they're watching you.

686
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,350
If there's anything
you need tidied up,

687
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,477
now is the time.

688
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,873
Nearly done.

689
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,878
For God's sake.

690
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,916
Sometimes I think they're all
sharing the same moronic brain.

691
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,675
If there's someone else,
you can tell me.

692
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,878
I'm a grown-up.

693
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:21,392
I know. It's just going to be
such a wonderful Christmas.

694
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,953
Excuse me.

695
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:34,039
♪ And I was too proud to give in

696
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:44,153
♪ I had to learn the hard way

697
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,356
- ♪ That pride... ♪
- Peter, when you're ready

698
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,833
Put it on now.

699
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,113
Everybody!

700
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,071
- Jerry.
- George.

701
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,593
- Peter.
- Jerry.

702
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,510
I need to talk to you.

703
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,074
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.

704
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,915
You were duty officer, weren't you?

705
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,354
Yeah. Control asked me
to man the phones that night.

706
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,119
He said someone was doing
a special job for the service.

707
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,958
He wanted someone he could trust.

708
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,669
'Hurricane Henry set
to be ridden by Ray Walsh at 7:2...'

709
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,598
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

710
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,954
This is from the FO resident clerk.

711
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,469
A Hungarian news bulletin.

712
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,670
"British spy, work name Ellis,

713
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,870
"travelling with false Hungarian papers,

714
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,471
"has attempted to kidnap an unnamed
Hungarian General in Budapest.

715
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,471
"He's been shot.

716
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,591
"Other arrests imminent."

717
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,191
Can I have a brief, please?

718
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,274
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

719
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,315
I must have a brief, sir.

720
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,795
'I couldn't get a word out of Control.

721
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,878
'So I followed protocol
and went for the emergency list.'

722
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,991
You rang my house.

723
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,509
Just on the off-chance
you were back from Berlin.

724
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:02,993
What did you say?

725
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,876
- 'Hello?'
- Hello, Mrs. Smiley.

726
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,991
It's Jerry.
Jerry Westerby from the office.

727
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,315
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

728
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,431
Ann said you wasn't back yet
and that was it.

729
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,635
Go on.

730
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,239
All hell broke loose.

731
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,669
Military yelling about
Hungarian tanks on the border.

732
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,360
Lacon and the minister
baying at the door.

733
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,794
Thank Christ
Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

734
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,069
- Mr. Haydon.
- Not now.

735
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,474
Mr. Haydon!

736
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,955
Out!

737
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,518
- Tell me.
- I tried to get hold of you.

738
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,677
I got half a story
on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.

739
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,637
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

740
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,831
Get me the Hungarian embassy.

741
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,678
You tell your masters what will happen

742
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,597
if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head
is damaged.

743
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,518
Get Esterhase on the phone.
Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

744
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,595
Yes, sir.

745
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,674
Any more news on him? Sir?

746
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,793
Oh, God.

747
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,514
We need to get down to his flat,
clear out anything linked.

748
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,958
Haydon heard the news at his club?

749
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,308
The Savile.

750
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,238
At 1:30? The ticker-tape
wouldn't have been running.

751
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,998
So how did he know?

752
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,953
- Jesus, George.
- Peter!

753
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,514
- How could he have known?
- It's not what you think.

754
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:15,394
- Then how did he know?
- He was at my house that night.

755
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,271
Good flight?

756
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,711
Yes.

757
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,717
Pleasant enough.

758
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,637
I was just passing.
I thought I'd call in.

759
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,631
Ann was in bed.
She insisted on getting up.

760
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,910
She said she'd be down in a minute.

761
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,990
That's what I'm dropping off.
It's an awful daub really.

762
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,835
But Ann expressed a liking.

763
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,551
What's keeping her?

764
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,913
Keep going.

765
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,031
Come on, lads. Keep up.

766
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,598
Come on, Bill!

767
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,720
- Got your specs on, Jumbo?
- Yes, sir.

768
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,432
Come here.

769
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,631
Who's that fellow down there?

770
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,356
I don't know, sir.

771
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,471
Who is he?

772
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,397
Beggar man?

773
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,919
Thief?

774
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,948
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

775
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,755
Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch
of boys flogging a car round a field?

776
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,151
What's the matter with him?
Doesn't he like us?

777
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,192
I don't hold with odd-bods
hanging around.

778
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,788
He might steal the Alvis.

779
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,150
- Which is?
- The best car in England, sir.

780
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,113
Good lad.

781
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,954
How were you briefed
for the Budapest mission?

782
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,992
Control asked me
to come to a flat in Kensington.

783
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,000
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

784
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,911
And we have to find it.

785
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,872
What did you make of it, Jim?

786
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,877
Control's theory?

787
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,874
I thought it was madness.

788
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,232
I know that it is one of five men.

789
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:24,315
All I want from you is one code name.

790
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,439
Alleline.

791
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,153
Tinker.

792
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,239
Haydon.

793
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,433
Tailor.

794
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,479
Bland.

795
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,319
Soldier.

796
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,439
We drop Sailor.
It's too close to Tailor.

797
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,630
And Rich Man doesn't seem
to be applicable.

798
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,999
Esterhase.

799
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,035
Poor Man.

800
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,798
And the fifth?

801
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,433
Smiley.

802
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,151
I thought it was madness.

803
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,512
To think that any one of you
could have been a traitor.

804
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,592
Absolute madness.

805
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,239
'But you still went.

806
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,430
'Why?'

807
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,597
'I went because Control
asked me to go.

808
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,109
'It's called doing one's duty.

809
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:53,436
'At the station I met the legman
supposed to take me to the General.

810
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,516
'The waiter must have panicked.

811
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,437
'It was meant to be
a simple snatch job.

812
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,388
'They drove me
to some military hospital,

813
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:09,193
'and then put me on a transport plane.

814
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,515
'I could tell by the stars
we were heading east.

815
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,831
'Then they worked me for...

816
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,435
'...I don't know how long.

817
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,710
'Weeks, maybe months.'

818
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,112
What did you tell them?

819
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,118
Everything.

820
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:14,074
I held on for as long as I could to let
everyone get the hell out of there.

821
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,559
Did they?

822
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,353
My networks in Hungary,
did they get out?

823
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,991
No, they were blown.

824
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,635
The story is you blew them
to save your own skin.

825
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,670
'After the interrogators had cleared out,
this little fellow turned up.

826

'Looked like a priest.

827
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,235
'That's when they really started on me.'

828
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,830
What was your last line of defence, hm?

829
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,952
The mole.

830
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,271
Control's crazy theory.

831
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,670
I was going to bury that so deep
they'd never get it out of me.

832
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,273
- Which was a joke.
- Why?

833
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,155
Because they already knew.

834
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,670
All they wanted to know was how far
Control had got in his investigation.

835
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,512
No, I don't know her.

836
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:58,152
Did they ask about me at all?

837
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,679
Yes.

838
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,557
The little fellow did.

839
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,558
What did he say about me?

840
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,196
He had this cigarette lighter.

841
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,194
He kept flashing it about
for me to see it.

842
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,590
Showed me the inscription.

843
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,836
- "To George..."
- "...from Ann.

844
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,878
"All my love."

845
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,919
Karla.

846

'It was odd.

847
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,348
'They sent me back to England.

848
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,914
'Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.'

849
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:16,430
He said when he was being debriefed
at the Nursery, he had a visitor.

850
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,629
Who?

851
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,558
'Toby Esterhase.

852
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,240
'He gave him £1,000 and an Alvis.'

853
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:27,437
Told him he was dead now.
Couldn't come back.

854
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,870
Had to become a lotus eater,
forget everything that happened.

855
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,797
Control's theory.

856
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,036
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.

857
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,954
Yes, that's what I thought.

858
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:43,198
How on earth did Esterhase
hear about Tinker, Tailor?

859
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,236
'Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre

860
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,557
'everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

861
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,989
'She told me
Karla was very proud of this.

862
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,192
'She said everything the Circus thinks
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

863
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,636
'Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre

864

865
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,717
'No, I had a hotel nearby.
They do have some seedy rooms.

866
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,796

869

'She said everything
the Circus thinks is gold is shit.'

870
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:40,872
This meeting is not taking place.
Is that clear?

871
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,558
Perfectly, Minister.

872
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:53,035
There is a house
somewhere in this city

873
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,675
where Alleline and the others meet
Witchcraft's London representative.

874
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,836
I thought Lacon had made it
clear to you.

875
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:03,430
Keep your nose bloody well
out of Witchcraft's business.

876
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,312
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

877
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,908
You told me
to follow in Control's footsteps.

878
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:12,511
I wouldn't consider that sound advice,
given the mess Control left us with.

879
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,639
It has taken Alleline
and, if I may say so, myself

880
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,716
this long to get us back in the game.

881
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,628
The man Alleline and the others
meet is called Polyakov.

882
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,793
'You believe his role
is to bring information

883
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,911
'from Witchcraft to you.

884
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,716
'His real role is to receive
information from the mole

885
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,353
'to take back to Karla.'

886
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,911
That, er...
That's not possible.

887
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,632
Made possible.

888
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,036
By you in the house you persuaded
the Treasury to pay for.

889
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:53,874
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine.
It's been gold.

890
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,118
It's just enough glitter
amongst the chicken feed.

891
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,993
Control didn't believe in miracles
or in Witchcraft.

892
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,838
But you were lazy and greedy

893
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,839
and so you hounded him
out of the Circus and you let Karla in.

894
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,479
You opened negotiations to exchange
intelligence with the Americans.

895
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,115
What they tell the Circus,
they'll be telling the Kremlin.

896
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:22,473
Witchcraft's information,
the "gold" Karla let you have,

897
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,636
it wasn't to lure you.

898
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,955
It was to lure the Americans.

899
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,672
Now,

900
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,791
do you want to take credit for that?

901
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,917
What can we do?

902
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,869
We have one thing the mole wants.

903
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:49,234
- If I go to Paris...
- You'll go.

904
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:52,033
If I go to Paris,

905
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,109
I want your word
that you will get lrina back.

906
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,036
I don't care who you have to trade.
And I am out.

907
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:07,553
I want a family, thank you.
I do not want to end up like you lot.

908
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,910
You will get her back.

909
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:15,069
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

910
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,071
Oh, hello, George.

911
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,599
Hello.

912
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,789
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

913
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:16,558
Control recruited you, didn't he?

914
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,717
Found you starving
in a museum in Vienna.

915
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,229
A wanted man.

916
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,351
Saved your life, I heard.

917
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,510
And yet when the time came,

918
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:29,915
when it came to picking sides
between him and Alleline,

919
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,917
you didn't hesitate.

920
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,515
That's understandable, perhaps,
with your war experience.

921
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:41,191
You survived this long, I suppose,
because of your ability to change sides.

922
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,311
Serve any master.

923
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,314
What? What's...
What's this about, George?

924
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:55,477
It's about which master
you've been serving, Toby.

925
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,788
'Intelligence
has been leaked, Toby.

926
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,673
'Someone's been taking files
from the Circus.

927
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,950
'No, no, no, no. No.'

928
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,752
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.

929
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,156
Files were delivered
to a Russian attaché, weren't they?

930
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,395
Yes.

931
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,754
'And, yes, I delivered them.'

932
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,235
'But so did Percy Alleline.'

933
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,148
Good boy.

934
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,271
'Bill Haydon.

935
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,951
'And so did Roy Bland.'

936
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,749
Things aren't always
what they seem, George.

937
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,757
You should know that.

938
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,235
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...

939
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,191
...working for them.

940
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,754
Every now and then we give him
the odd file to take back to them.

941
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:04,189
Chicken feed,
just to keep his bosses happy.

942
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,637
But Polyakov's our Joe.

943
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,309
- He's a part of a big operation.
- Operation Witchcraft.

944
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:15,673
Yes, I know.

945
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,232
George.

946
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,079
- Please, I don't deserve this.
- Who gave you the message

947
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,794
for Jim Prideaux
to forget about Tinker, Tailor?

948
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,115
- Bland.
- To get rid of Connie Sachs?

949
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,912
- Westerby?
- Bland.

950
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,156
Or Haydon.

951
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,998
I don't know. One of them.

952
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,997
Or maybe Percy. No.

953
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,714
Well, I don't know who.

954
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,956
You're just the messenger.

955
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,514
Running between them all.

956
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,995
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

957
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,515
I know all about your secret source.

958
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,191
And I know something you don't.

959
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:57,190
I know who he is.

960
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:01,471
He's Karla.

961
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:13,118
'One of you has been giving
Polyakov the crown jewels.'

962
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,277
- I did not know.
- Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

963
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,109
- Look, George, I didn't know. I...
- You picked the wrong side.

964
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:22,037
No, you've got to believe me.

965
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:24,390
George, please.

966
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,430
I am loyal.

967
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,390
I... I am loyal.

968
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,355
Don't... Don't...
Don't send me back.

969
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,277
Please, George.

970
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,792
Don't send me back.

971
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,071
Give me the address.

972
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,469
Where do you meet Polyakov?

973
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,710
Hey, hey!
Dog, dog, be quiet!

974
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,473
What is this? Who are you?

975
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,397
- Mrs. McCraig?
- Yes.

976
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,789
- What are the safety signals?
- The air vent.

977
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,229
Open and all's well,
closed and you're not to enter.

978
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,835
And the microphone?

979
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,799
Peter?

980
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,598
The boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but he had fled

981
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,029
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone brightly o'er the dead

982
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:23,236
'Beautiful and proud he stood
as born to rule the storm

983
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,477
'A creature of blood,
a proud though child-like form'

984
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,160
The flames rolled on...

985
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,678
Merci. Au revoir.

986
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,959
Go on.

987
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,471
The whole service is looking for you.

988
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,831
- They'll skin you alive if they find you.
- Maybe I want them to find me.

989
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,552
You can go now. Leave the books
and put the keys in the machines.

990
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,194
No, Ben stays here.

991
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:41,474
Ricki Tarr claims to have information
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

992
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:04,637
'Mr. Smiley?'

993
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,393
Taxi approaching Circus.

994
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,679
Tinker.

995
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,838
Tailor.

996
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,592
Here comes Soldier.

997
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,718
'Full house.'

998
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,552
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.
- "Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

999
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:09,838
"Require clarification
before meeting your request.

1000
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:16,676
"Quote, information vital
to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote

1001
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,993
"does not qualify,
send further information."

1002
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:25,112
Ah! That's it, Percy,
you keep stalling.

1003
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,959
I warn you, Ben. We've got
some really lousy people in this outfit.

1004
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:30,196
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

1005
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,876
'The meeting's over.

1006
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,031
'They're leaving.'

1007
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,636
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

1008
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:42,955
I keep thinking how much
I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.

1009
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:53,678
I was rather hoping you might do
a little light housekeeping for me.

1010
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,992
If I can.

1011
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:02,111
There's a girl.
Give her some money, would you?

1012
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,356
And give her a good cover story.

1013
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:09,193
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1014
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,992
It's all there.

1015
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:14,999
And there's a boy, too.
Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1016
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:21,119
I know the inquisitors' bag of tricks.
I taught most of them.

1017
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:25,671
It's just a reaction.

1018
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,954
An over-reaction, if you like.

1019
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:32,640
I did have one or two questions.

1020
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,157
- About Prideaux.
- Goddamn it!

1021
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,078
- I got him back, didn't I?
- Yes, yes, you did.

1022
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,077
That was good of you.

1023
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:47,237
I am surprised
Karla didn't have him shot.

1024
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:51,359
Or do you think he held back,

1025
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,948
out of delicacy towards you?

1026
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:01,917
Did Prideaux come and see you
before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1027
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,595
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1028
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:11,076
To say what?

1029
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,117
To warn you.

1030
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:22,428
Because he knew deep down

1031
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,431
it was you all along.

1032
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,995
So did you.

1033
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,149
I had to pick a side, George.

1034
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,911
It was an aesthetic choice
as much as a moral one.

1035
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:47,152
And the West has become
so very ugly.

1036
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,918
Don't you think?

1037
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:54,996
Did Karla ever consider
having you take over the Circus?

1038
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,350
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1039
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,869
What are you, then, Bill?

1040
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,435
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1041
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:26,071
Is there anything particular
you want me to pass on to Ann?

1042
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:34,037
Oh, that was nothing personal, George.
I hope you understand that.

1043
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,355
Karla said you were good,

1044
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,517
the one we had to worry about.

1045
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:42,950
But you do have a blind spot.

1046
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,355
He reckoned
if I was known to be Ann's lover,

1047
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,558
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

1048
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,877
And he was right.

1049
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:56,117
Up to a point.

1050
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,198
Up to a point.

1051
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,157
I made this for you, sir.

1052
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:40,592
I don't want you
hanging around here any more.

1053
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,436
Keep away from me from now on.

1054
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:48,228
- Go and join the others.
- But...

1055
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:51,158
Just... Just bloody join in, will you?

1056
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,114
Go and play, damn you!

1057
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,480
Could you check, Jerry?
