1
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,065
You weren't followed?

2
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,447
No.

3
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,407
Better come in.

4
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,619
Trust no one, Jim.

5
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,787
Especially not in the mainstream.

6
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,753
Sit down.

7
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,266
I understand you still have one Hungarian identity running?

8
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,815
I do.

9
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,323
I want you to go to Budapest.

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,412
This is not above board.

11
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,626
Nobody else knows.

12
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,672
They're after my head, Jim boy.

13
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,088
Do you understand?

14
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,823
I have had an offer of service.

15
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,495
A Hungarian general wants to come over.

16
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,953
I would like you to meet him.

17
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,339
He has some information that I need, Jim.

18
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,506
What information?

19
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,967
Treasure.

20
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,685
He has the name of the mole,

21
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,481
the Russians have planted in the British intelligence service

22
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,525
right at the top of the Circus.

23
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,243
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,536
We have to find it.

25
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,812
Stop!

26
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,642
Would you witness this for me?

27
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,436
I wish I could done more, Control.

28
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,151
You did all you could, Percy.

29
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,986
Well, a man should know when to leave the party.

30
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,328
What about Smiley?

31
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,623
Smiley is leaving with me.

32
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,233
You little prick, Esterhase.

33
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,161
Gentlemen, shall we start?

34
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,054
Under Secretary Lacon is ready for you, Sir Percy.

35
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,602
The Treasury don't understand.

36
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,946
Why can't the intelligence service simply put in a request

37
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,656
for a general increase in funding

38
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,697
and then you account for the spend on your special operation?

39
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,576
Operation Witchcraft needs to remain secret.

40
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,667
- It's a fiefdom of its own.  - Yes, that's what's worrying us.

41
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,411
The whole thing's very unaccountable, isn't it?

42
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,754
And this London house that nobody knows the address of,

43
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,501
is that really necessary?

44
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,005
Now more than ever. We need to protect our Soviet source.

45
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,851
So where do you propose we meet? In a caf?

46
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,686
The rent and rates on this house have doubled.

47
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,895
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

48
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,895
We're asking for a few thousand for a house.

49
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,022
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

50
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,864
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

51
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,529
Look, nobody underestimates

52
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,277
the importance of the job you chaps are doing.

53
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,700
But what happened in Budapest last year,

54
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,583
that was a disaster.

55
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,623
With respect, sir,

56
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,793
it wasn't one of your civil servants that got killed, was it?

57
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,337
Now this isn't about soldiers in trenches any more.

58
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,711
- We're the front line now...  - Roy!

59
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,260
For 25 years we've been the only thing 

60
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,260
standing between them and Karla

61
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,633
and Moscow and the third bloody world war.

62
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,938
Look, the Minister's very pleased with your progress so far.

63
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,733
He's less pleased, though,

64
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,478
with the lack of progress with our American cousins.

65
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,568
You see,

66
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,737
in their eyes,

67
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,361
you're still a leaky ship.

68
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,554
Yes?

69
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,720
Someone on the line for you, sir. Seems urgent. 

70
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,593
All right, well put him through.

71
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,766
- Hello?  - Is this Under Secretary Lacon? 

72
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,267
Yes.

73
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,611
My name's Ricki Tarr.

74
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,068
- What do you want?  - I need to meet you.

75
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,740
If you need to confirm who I am, 

76
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

77
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,612
Peter Guillam.

78
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,411
But only Guillam, no one else.

79
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,514
You got clearance for that?

80
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,510
Well, I'm not bloody chaining it up outside.

81
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,708
Mind you, no better off in here 

82
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,308
with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

83
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,978
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

84
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,648
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse of the new girl 

85
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:47,648
before Bland gets to her.

86
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,113
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

87
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,324
- Has he seen her yet?  - Of course he has.

88
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,114
Came down first thing this morning.

89
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,952
Belinda.

90
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,007
- Peter Guillam.  - Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

91
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,718
Just ringing to find out...

92
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,339
So Winston Churchill saved your life, Edie.

93
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,058
I was working in the kitchen, getting dinner ready.

94
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,927
And he was late, you see.

95
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,429
- During a raid?  - During a raid, you see.

96
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,397
He said, "Why aren't you in that shelter?"

97
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,062
- Why weren't you?  - Well, because... 

98
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,663
I was sorry to hear about Control, Mr Smiley.

99
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,924
He said Tarr called him from a phone box.

100
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,773
He said there's a mole,

101
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,194
right at the top of the Circus,

102
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,986
that he's been there for years.

103
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,296
It does mean

104
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,424
you're rather well placed to look into this matter for us now,

105
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,597
doesn't it?

106
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,387
Outside the family.

107
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,941
I'm retired, Oliver.

108
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,284
You fired me.

109
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,278
The thing is,

110
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,326
some time ago before Control died,

111
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,040
he came to me with a similar suggestion.

112
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,415
That there is a mole.

113
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,709
He never mentioned his suspicions to you?

114
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,132
No.

115
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,883
Oh, I just thought that as you were his man, so to speak...

116
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,351
What did you say to him?

117
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,266
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had rather gotten the better of him

118
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,357
and he was going to pull his whole house down.

119
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,601
That bloody mess in Budapest.

120
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,990
Damn it, George.

121
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,201
It's your generation, your legacy.

122
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,190
I would have thought, if there's any truth in it, 

123
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,990
you'd want to...

124
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,068
I'll keep Peter.

125
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,827
And there's a retired Special Branch man, Mendel.

126
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,080
I should like to have him.

127
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,494
Lift up.

128
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,503
And quickly down again.

129
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,014
There's a place I know, sir. 

130
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:46,014
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

131
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:24,171
Be careful with it. Please. It's Georgian.

132
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,094
My friend wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope Graham.

133
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,342
No disturbances.

134
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,811
Her real name is just Graham.

135
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,056
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

136
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,871
Peter, did you get the keys to Control's flat? 

137
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:05,629
# And did those feet in ancient time #

138
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,008
# Walk upon England's mountains green #

139
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,811
Oh!

140
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,104
George! 

141
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,565
George, get in here!

142
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,864
George.

143
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,580
Sit down.

144
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,083
Take a look at this nonsense.

145
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,594
Report by Soviet high command

146
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,591
on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea.

147
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,389
Just what the admiralty has been begging us
 142

148
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,227
for some information on.

149
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,606
- Where did you get this?  - I didn't.

150
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,600
Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.

151
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,819
- Look, Control...  - Shut up.

152
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,984
Style appalling.

153
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,109
Patently a fabrication from beginning to end.

154
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,963
Just could be the real thing. 

155
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:37,363
Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

156
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,208
But its topicality makes it suspect.

157
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,625
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

158
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,590
Where did it come from? What's the access?

159
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,709
A new secret source of mine.

160
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,506
But how could he possibly have access?

161
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,802
He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy-making.

162
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,308
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

163
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,395
Oh, Percy and his pals bypassed us, Smiley.

164
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,684
Gone straight to the minister.

165
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:08,106
Percy has been allowed to keep the identity of his new friend

166
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,648
top secret.

167
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,400
The minister agrees too many secrets are blown around here.

168
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,446
Too much failure, too many scandals.

169
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,112
Too little solid intelligence. 

170
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:18,912
Percy does have a point, Control.

171
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,657
We should be fighting Communism, not each other.

172
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,501
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners.

173
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,961
Your bloody Yanks!

174
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,502
We've had enough! There's going to be changes.

175
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,422
We need to decide if want to be part of the past 

176
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:32,422
or part of the future.

177
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,671
I should have left you where I found you.

178
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,844
- Look!  - Control...

179
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,683
Out, all of you!

180
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,792
If Witchcraft is genuine...

181
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,253
Nothing is genuine any more.

182
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,606
George...

183
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,647
Do you want me to get this stuff over to the hotel?

184
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,969
Thank you. Er, anywhere will do.

185
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,342
- Peter?  - Hm?

186
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,842
I need you to do something for me.

187
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,444
I'd lik e you to go to the Circus.

188
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,159
In the cabinet at the duty officers' station

189
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,528
are records of staff recently retired.

190
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,623
I'd like photographs of them

191
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:32,167
and of the diagram of the Circus's reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

192
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,960
along with a list of all payments made from the Reptile fund.

193
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:10,620
Help you with anything, Bill?  

194
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,420
I was just looking for his Majesty.

195
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,710
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

196
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,919
Oh.

197
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,374
Heard you had an accident, Peter.  

198
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,174
Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

199
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,010
When are you going to get some new furniture up here?

200
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,388
I'll have a word with Esterhase.

201
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,388
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.

202
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,887
- Where are you off to?  - Lunch.

203
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,104
Want some company?

204
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,232
According to the personnel files,

205
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,945
seven were due for retirement anyway.

206
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,315
Another four don't seem particularly mysterious.

207
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,444
Jerry Westerby was dismissed December 4.

208
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,488
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

209
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,788
That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.

210
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,213
- Return to Oxford, please.  - That's 1.15.

211
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,779
Percy has always resisted any proposal

212
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,700
of a wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.

213
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,697
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

214
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,667
I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies so far, Minister.

215
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,829
Greedy boy.

216
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,458
My goal has been to establish its track record beyond all doubt.

217
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,383
I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in-arms.

218
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,977
Will they take us back into bed?  

219
00:29:34,977 --> 00:29:36,977
I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

220
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,603
I want on-going access to American intelligence.

221
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,319
You think we can get it?

222
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,191
With Witchcraft on our side, 

223
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:47,191
we can get anything we bloody well want.

224
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,954
Fine.

225
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,074
Carry on.

226
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,790
Thank you.

227
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,888
And I strike thee down...

228
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,703
Oh, I, er...

229
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,751
Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.

230
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,426
Wicked, wicked George.

231
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,412
I don't know about you, George,

232
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,032
but I f eel seriously under-fucked.

233
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,042
I heard Ann left you again.

234
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,924
She doesn't deserve you, George, not one hair on your head.

235
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:35,299
You left the Circus shortly after I retired.

236
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,928
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

237
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,933
Chucked out on the rubbish heap, like you.

238
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,058
Why?

239
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,694
Polyakov.

240
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,693
Do you remember him?

241
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,992
From the Soviet Embassy?

242
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,084
Alexsey Polyakov, cultural attache here in London.

243
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,539
When he arrived here 15 years ago, I requested he be checked out.

244
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,336
He was graded whiter than white. Didn't put a foot wrong.

245
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,593
But you disagreed?

246
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,511
There's a story you must have heard

247
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,602
that Karla has set up a secret cell.

248
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,686
The personnel are all ex-military,

249
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,900
trained to handle deep-penetration agents, moles.

250
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,815
There are always stories, Connie.

251
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,439
But what if this story was true?

252
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:38,195
One night in research I saw something, George.

253
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,823
There was our friend Polyakov at a May day parade in Berlin

254
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,576
receiving a salute.

255
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,500
Why would you salute a cultural attache?

256
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,341
Exactly. Unless he was a war veteran himself.

257
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,179
And if he was, why hide the fact?

258
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,968
What did you do?

259
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,716
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

260
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,019
Here.

261
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,561
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood if ever I saw one.

262
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,809
If he's here, it must be because he's running a mole.

263
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,027
You're to leave Polyakov alone.

264
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,272
You're becoming obsessed with him.

265
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,448
- You're losing your sense of proportion, Connie.  - But that's ridiculous.

266
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,698
Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world.

267
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:39,173
What does it matter? Old Circus is gone anyway.

268
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,028
Here we are.

269
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,197
The nursery in our day.

270
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,285
Jim Prideaux.

271
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,035
And Bill Haydon. Together, of course.

272
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,541
The Inseparables.

273
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,838
There's Control himself.

274
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,633
All my boys.

275
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,716
All my lovely boys.

276
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,766
That was a good time, George.

277
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,366
It was the war, Connie.

278
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,605
A real war.

279
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,902
Englishmen could be proud then.

280
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,950
So I was right, then?

281
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,373
About Polyakov.

282
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,371
There is a mole.

283
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:02,424
If it's bad, don't come back. I want to remember you all as you were.

284
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,019
Percy? Percy, did you mix this?

285
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,976
Aye, I did so.

286
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,822
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

287
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,113
Can you learn to take a bloody order?

288
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,328
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

289
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,288
- I followed the recipe.  - Come on.

290
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,534
It'll take us five hours to get drunk on this monkey's piss.

291
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,712
# He's not the first #

292
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,711
- # He's not the first #  - Oh, well.

293
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,839
- # He's the second best secret agent #  - Merry Christmas.

294
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,886
# In the whole wide world

295
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,510
# He's not number one #

296
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,184
# But not the worst #

297
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,023
# He's just the second best secret agent #

298
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,894
# in the whole wide world #

299
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,691
# He's every bit #

300
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,030
# as good as what's-his-name #

301
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,031
# With a dame #

302
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,449
# Any dame #

303
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,951
# And all those bullet holes are in his vest

304
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,038
# To prove you work a little harder #

305
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,460
# When you're second best... #

306
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,994
- Courtesy of Mrs P.  - Hm?

307
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,204
You been up all night?

308
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,991
Yes.

309
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,045
What's this?

310
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:30,013
Request for $1,000 in cash from the Reptile fund.

311
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,348
To a Mr Ellis.

312
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,059
It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.

313
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,059
Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago.

314
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,648
October 21.

315
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,653
So why was someone giving him $1,000 two months later?

316
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,617
I wonder where he is then, sir.

317
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,769
Settle down now.

318
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,154
- Hand those out.  - Sir.

319
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,152
What is it? The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?

320
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,913
The bells, the bells!

321
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,895
Ohh!

322
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,285
Come here.

323
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,985
- What's your name?  - Roach. Bill Roach, sir.

324
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,886
- I'm a new boy.  - New arrival, eh?

325
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,178
- What's the story?  - My mother and father.

326
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,261
My father left, so...

327
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,728
Hm.

328
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,307
Bill.

329
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,150
The unpaid Bill.

330
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,651
- Anyone ever call you that?  - No, sir.

331
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,866
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

332
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,116
They've all been good 'uns.

333
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,199
What are you good at?

334
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,826
Nothing, sir.

335
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,796
You're a good watcher, though, eh?

336
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,464
Us loners always are.

337
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,882
Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'II bet.

338
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,678
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right?  - Yes, sir.

339
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,182
This is good, very good.

340
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,768
Hello, Ricki.

341
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,361
You've missed the wedge.

342
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,871
Where have you been, Ricki?

343
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,587
They're going to kill me.

344
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:22,255
- Who is?  - Your lot.

345
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,723
Or their lot. Whoever gets me first.

346
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,895
I'm innocent.

347
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,560
Within reason.

348
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,309
How long have you been here?

349
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,358
Sorry, I've run out of places now.

350
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,402
I needed to see you.

351
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,783
Why?

352
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,616
There's a woman.

353
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,618
I need you to trade for her. I need you to get her back off Karla.

354
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,581
A woman?

355
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,385
Her name's Irina.

356
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,475
This was last November.

357
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:12,438
Mr Guillam sent me to Istanbul to check out a Russian trade delegate

358
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,478
who might be persuaded to defect.

359
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,443
- Tufty Thesinger, resident.  - Yeah.

360
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,028
- Hiya, Ricki.  - All right, mate?

361
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,741
- Did you know him?  -No, never met him.

362
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,609
Bit of a drinker.

363
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,326
Hangover from hell.

364
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,537
Bit of a fucking idiot.

365
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,746
Apparently this Russian, name of Boris,

366
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,336
was spending high and wide in the nightclubs.

367
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,046
So you were sent to persuade this Boris? 

368
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,543
Yeah. He was your typical Russian.

369
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,762
Trade delegation by day, out boozing every night.

370
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,756
Didn't seem to sleep.

371
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,054
Tufty was worn out from following him around.'

372
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,054
I think it's going to be a long night, son.

373
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,932
His favourite haunt was this club in Taksim.

374
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:59,606
It had a hellhole in the basement where the sailors and the tourists went.

375
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:05,233
Anyway, I took one look at him and I knew I'd wasted a journey.

376
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,202
Boris was no delegate.

377
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:14,209
What delegate bothers to play drunker than he really is?

378
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,413
You get to recognise your own, don't you, Mr Smiley?

379
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:20,910
And Boris was a hood

380
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,210
Moscow Centre trained.

381
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,884
# Someone is waiting #

382
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,802
# I mean just for you #

383
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,179
# Spinning wheel #

384
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,770
# Keep on spinning through, Drop all your troubles... #

385
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,641
I guessed he was waiting for a connect.

386
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,777
Working a letterbox, maybe.

387
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:46,491
Or trailing his coat and looking for a pass from some mug like me.'

388
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,782
So the second night I went to the import/export outfit

389
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:54,578
that Tufty had set up with a cipher room hidden in the back.

390
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,747
I cabled "No sale" to Mr Guillam.

391
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,914
And that was that.

392
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,592
You were due to fly home the next day.

393
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,130
Yes.

394
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,885
But you didn't.

395
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,605
Boris had a wife.

396
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,151
Common-law.

397
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:32,116
Apparently she was a member of the delegation in her own right.

398
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,719
You once told me to trust my instincts about women, Mr Smiley.

399
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,477
Well, my instincts told me this woman had some treasure.

400
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,104
When Boris went out for the night, I found myself going into her hotel.'

401
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,104
So you dropped Boris.

402
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,608
I know. It was breaking protocol.

403
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:57,951
But I was acting on my own initiative, as it were.

404
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,076
Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?

405
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,295
I just wanted to make sure you were all right, OK?

406
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,539
So you didn't come home?

407
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,752
I would have.

408
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,004
Boris was a dead end, but...

409
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,466
Um...

410
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,468
I could...

411
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,726
I could sense something in her.

412
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,191
A secret.

413
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,781
And how did you intend to get this secret out of her?

414
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,075
I played this businessman, Michael Trench.

415
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,126
Holiday romance.

416
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,754
I thought I'd take my time with it.

417
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,852
I know who you are.

418
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,690
I want to talk to your boss.

419
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,404
Control.

420
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,656
I have something to trade.

421
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,324
Something big.

422
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,123
I want a new life in the West.

423
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,836
That's the deal.

424
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,128
You tell them.

425
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,682
Look, you can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.

426
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:33,152
If you won't tell me more, there is nothing I can do.

427
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,493
If I tell you everything,

428
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,533
I'm putting my life in your hands.

429
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,000
And the lives of other people.

430
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,439
So she told me what she had to trade.

431
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,150
Her secret.

432
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,612
I mean,

433
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,948
the mother of all secrets.

434
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,578
I told her I'd alert the Circus.

435
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:10,325
She made me promise I wouldn't give any of the details to London.

436
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,328
- And you agreed?  - Yes.

437
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,293
I mean it was...

438
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,667
I couldn't believe I'd got hold of something this big.

439
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,590
I went back to the import export,

440
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,807
sent the message to the Circus, graded, "Flash, highest priority",

441
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:30,177
just that I had a Moscow-trained hood wanting to defect.

442
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:35,149
You're supposed to have gone. London stations have been on to me.

443
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,518
Want to know what the hell you're doing.

444
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,032
Fuck off.

445
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,243
Anything else, Ricki? 

446
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,536
I know what I am to the Circus. I'm one of the scalp-hunters,

447
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,584
someone that you can hand your dirty little jobs to.

448
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,714
I just...

449
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,055
I just wanted to bring this one in myself.

450
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,516
Well, I understand how you felt.

451
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,062
You wanted to do something.

452
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:16,526
I said that she claimed to have information 

453
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,526
Vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

454
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,481
Anything more?

455
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,631
I said that she had information concerning a double agent.

456
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:48,256
Look, I just wanted to get the proper attention. And I'd...

457
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,388
I told them this was the reason why I had not come home.

458
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,762
It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.

459
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,563
- What did you do then?  - I waited for a reply.

460
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,443
I hung around for hours. I remember heard the lmsak call to prayer.

461
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,447
- So what's that time?  - That's about 3. 30 in the morning.'

462
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,783
Then the message comes through.

463
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,131
"We read you."

464
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,427
That was all they sent. Nothing.

465
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,886
It didn't make sense. It was like they were stalling.

466
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,520
Then what happened?

467
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,610
Then, all of a sudden...

468
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,777
the Russians begin to move.

469
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:25,106
It was nice work. I couldn't have done it better myself.

470
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:35,496
The message was quite clear. I needed to warn her. '

471
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,137
Come on, come on, come on.

472
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,613
I looked for her everywhere couldn't find her at the airport.

473
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,575
I even looked through all the flight lists and...

474
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,028
I headed down to the harbour.

475
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,375
They put her on a ship to Odessa.

476
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,550
That's all I know.

477
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,186
I've...

478
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,567
I've done a lot of things in my life, Mr Smiley, but...

479
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,164
I just... I can't stop thinking about her.

480
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,549
She wasn't even my type.

481
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,972
I've got to get her out. I owe her that.

482
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,727
Karla will be looking for you.

483
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,646
Everybody's looking for me.

484
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,439
You can't stay here.

485
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,484
It isn't safe.

486
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:27,790
I said, "You may fuck me but you'll call me "Sir" in the morning."

487
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:31,755
OK. Just need to let you know.

488
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:35,876
Someone flew into Paris last week on one of our escaped passports.

489
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:39,346
- And?  - lt wasRicki Tarr.

490
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,595
Why are you telling me? 

491
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,686
- It could be coincidence...  - You are a poisoned dwarf.

492
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:47,304
Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty?

493
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,773
and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret 

494
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:57,026
Mr Esterhase: "It could be coincidence,but..."

495
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,826
Mr Haydon interrupting.

496
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,616
You really are a poisoned dwarf, Toby.

497
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,573
Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

498
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,201
and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?

499
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,431
You look tired.

500
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,682
I didn't sleep well.

501
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,149
You're going to do something for me, Peter.

502
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,650
I need the duty officer's log book for last November.

503
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:43,573
I'm going to have to send you up a floor into the lions' den.

504
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:53,457
If you're caught, you can't mention me.

505
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,714
I'm sorry, but you're alone.

506
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,711
- Last November?  - Hm.

507
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,605
Mr Guillam!

508
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,768
Thank you, Bryant.

509
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,111
How's the family?

510
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,652
Fine. Need to go up to the registry today.

511
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,320
OK, sir.

512
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:26,328
Now you'll need a yellow one for the bag, sir.

513
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,203
Thank you.

514
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:56,396
- Good morning, Mr Guillam.  - Morning, Alwyn.

515
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,985
- Want me to look after that for you?  - Thank you.

516
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,818
I'll need your chit, Mr Guillam.

517
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,786
Dolphin will kill me if I don't. New rules.

518
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,415
So, chit me.

519
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,839
Thanks.

520
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,969
- So lovely surprise.  - Peter.

521
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,770
- What are you up to this weekend?  - Oh, you know.

522
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,562
Visiting aunts.

523
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,605
I'll bet.

524
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,072
Corridor D.

525
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,447
The two eights are halfway on your right.

526
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,369
The three ones are next alcove down.

527
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,366
Thanks.

528
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,123
Here's a request from Libby Barr from Bromley

529
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,048
for Mr Wu's A Window Cleaner Now". Take it away, George.

530
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,561
Hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.

531
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,197
Can I speak to Mr Guillam, please? '

532
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,198
I'm his car mechanic.

533
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,952
Well, I'll just see if he's available. Hold on, please.

534
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,207
# Mr Wu, what shall I do?#

535
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,221
- Oh, Christ!  - Telephone, sir.

536
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,183
- Who is it? - Outside line, sir. Someone rough.

537
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,903
Sir?

538
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,321
- Hello?  - Your gearbox is bust, sir.

539
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,785
Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?

540
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,028
Can't be done. Probably you need a new gear box, sir.

541
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:01,202
Well, phone the main dealership first. Have you got their number?

542
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,418
No.

543
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,538
Hang on. Alwyn!

544
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,129
- Alwyn.  - Sir?

545
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,717
Get me my bag, will you?

546
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,586
- But...  - Just for a second.

547
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,100
Thank you.

548
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,722
Hang on.

549
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,248
- Hello?  - I'm listening.

550
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:43,665
- Yes. 9-4-6-0-3-3-5.  - Be right on it, sir.

551
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,287
Thank you.

552
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,383
Peter Guillam.

553
01:04:51,714 --> 01:04:54,251
Could we see you, please?

554
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:56,339
Percy would like quite an urgent word with you.

555
01:04:56,468 --> 01:04:59,380
If you can come now to the fifth floor that would be so kind.

556
01:04:59,513 --> 01:05:00,969
Yes, of course.

557
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:04,966
Throw that into the lift for me.

558
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:07,639
Send it to the second floor, save me filling out bloody chits.

559
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:09,432
Will do, sir.

560
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,333
So what have you been getting up to down there these days?

561
01:05:31,462 --> 01:05:33,748
Apart from chasing our virgins.

562
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:38,249
A couple of Arab ploys that look quite promising.

563
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,636
Apart from that, I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

564
01:05:42,765 --> 01:05:44,596
Arabs.

565
01:05:44,725 --> 01:05:47,341
You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right, Bill?

566
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,688
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

567
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:56,729
Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.

568
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:01,359
I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.

569
01:06:01,492 --> 01:06:03,653
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

570
01:06:11,502 --> 01:06:13,367
What's that shrug for?

571
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,251
I'm talking to you about the traitor

572
01:06:18,384 --> 01:06:21,876
who cut the throat of our man in Istanbul.

573
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:25,345
I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section.

574
01:06:25,474 --> 01:06:29,387
I'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back.

575
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,852
Don't damn well shrug at me!

576
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:34,938
How would you like a term in prison?

577
01:06:45,994 --> 01:06:48,736
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

578
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:53,040
So get your facts straight and get off my back!

579
01:06:53,168 --> 01:06:57,002
So... if I told you Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

580
01:06:57,131 --> 01:06:58,917
would you be surprised?

581
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:01,210
No, nothing would surprise me about Ricki Tarr.

582
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:06,091
And if I told you we happen to know 30,000 mysteriously appeared

583
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:08,464
in his bank account last month,

584
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,932
would that surprise you?

585
01:07:16,525 --> 01:07:19,187
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

586
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:21,016
Turned by the opposition months ago 

587
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:22,686
and now they've sent him back to us.

588
01:07:22,823 --> 01:07:25,610
- What for?  - Never mind what for.

589
01:07:25,743 --> 01:07:28,280
To muddy the water, that's what for.

590
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:32,325
To spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

591
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:33,868
The point is this.

592
01:07:34,001 --> 01:07:35,582
He's heading for home.

593
01:07:36,754 --> 01:07:38,836
The first peep from him, you come to the grown-ups.

594
01:07:38,964 --> 01:07:40,670
Understood?

595
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,337
Anyone you see around this table but not another damn soul.

596
01:07:47,222 --> 01:07:48,758
Get out.

597
01:07:56,231 --> 01:07:57,596
Peter?

598
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:04,811
Thank you, Belinda.

599
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:12,236
# Oh, Mr Wu #

600
01:08:12,372 --> 01:08:14,112
# What shall I do? #

601
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:21,370
# Oh, Mr Wu #

602
01:08:21,507 --> 01:08:23,293
# What shall I do? #

603
01:08:23,425 --> 01:08:24,961
# Mr Wu... #

604
01:08:33,644 --> 01:08:35,600
All go smoothly, did it?

605
01:08:35,729 --> 01:08:37,515
I need to go to the hotel to see George.

606
01:08:37,648 --> 01:08:40,640
Mr Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue.

607
01:08:52,538 --> 01:08:54,028
George?

608
01:09:02,422 --> 01:09:04,458
Mr Guillam...

609
01:09:05,634 --> 01:09:07,625
Sorry it took me so long to come home.

610
01:09:19,565 --> 01:09:21,647
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

611
01:09:21,775 --> 01:09:24,858
He's been telling us all about his adventures.

612
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,895
He's a double, George.

613
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:30,989
There is no mole. Whole thing's been thought up by Moscow.

614
01:09:31,118 --> 01:09:33,359
Karla bought him for 30,000.

615
01:09:33,495 --> 01:09:36,362
I stole that because of you.

616
01:09:36,498 --> 01:09:38,073
I spied on my own because of him. 

617
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:40,082
Do you know how that makes me feel?

618
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,450
Ricki...

619
01:09:41,587 --> 01:09:42,985
you said you sent the Circus a telegram 

620
01:09:42,987 --> 01:09:45,205
concerning Irina's information.

621
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,251
- That's right.  - What was the date?

622
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,375
He doesn't know because there was no telegram.

623
01:09:49,511 --> 01:09:53,003
- The whole thing is a fabrication.  - 20th November.

624
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,223
It must have been 20th November. Evening.

625
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,888
lrina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

626
01:09:59,021 --> 01:10:01,558
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

627
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:05,433
- She told me Karla...  - November 20th is missing.

628
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:09,562
Someone is covering their tracks, unless of course you think

629
01:10:09,698 --> 01:10:11,563
that's just a coincidence?

630
01:10:15,704 --> 01:10:17,285
What about the money?

631
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:21,282
30,000 isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his mole.

632
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,708
I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mr Tarr

633
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:30,798
and is doing everything they can to discredit him.

634
01:10:30,928 --> 01:10:34,341
Everything the Circus thinks its' gold is shit, made in Moscow.

635
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:42,929
Why didn't you tell me that you had Tarr?

636
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:52,772
In case I never made it out of the Circus.I should get some rest.

637
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:56,984
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

638
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:00,036
Come up.

639
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:14,000
I met him once.

640
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:16,962
Karla.

641
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:20,007
In 55.

642
01:11:23,188 --> 01:11:25,474
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

643
01:11:27,609 --> 01:11:30,692
Purge after purge.

644
01:11:30,821 --> 01:11:33,187
Half their agents were jumping ship.

645
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:36,865
I travelled around, signing them up.

646
01:11:38,453 --> 01:11:39,863
Hundreds of them.

647
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:46,370
One of them was calling himself Gerstmann.

648
01:11:47,295 --> 01:11:49,536
He was on his way back to Russia

649
01:11:49,673 --> 01:11:53,131
and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed.

650
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:57,754
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi and that's how long I had

651
01:11:57,889 --> 01:12:01,006
to convince him to come over to us

652
01:12:01,143 --> 01:12:03,225
instead of going home to die.

653
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:10,690
There's a little room.

654
01:12:13,238 --> 01:12:16,822
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

655
01:12:21,413 --> 01:12:24,871
The Americans had him tortured.

656
01:12:28,962 --> 01:12:31,044
He had no fingernails.

657
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,876
It's incredibly hot.

658
01:12:41,266 --> 01:12:45,726
I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home.

659
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:51,056
Things weren't going well with Ann.

660
01:12:54,946 --> 01:12:56,652
I give him the usual pitch.

661
01:12:56,782 --> 01:13:00,866
"Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life,

662
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:03,910
"after questioning."

663
01:13:07,918 --> 01:13:09,749
What did he say?

664
01:13:14,883 --> 01:13:16,714
"Think of your wife.

665
01:13:19,387 --> 01:13:21,548
You have a wife, don't you?

666
01:13:25,018 --> 01:13:27,930
Here. I brought you some cigarettes, by the way.

667
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:33,770
Use my lighter.

668
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:44,155
We could arrange for her to join you. We have a lot of stock to trade.

669
01:13:45,997 --> 01:13:49,364
If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her."

670
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:51,207
"Think about..."

671
01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:57,456
I kept on...

672
01:13:58,844 --> 01:14:01,176
harping on about the damn wife,

673
01:14:03,723 --> 01:14:05,805
telling him more about me than...

674
01:14:09,396 --> 01:14:11,478
I should have walked out, of course.

675
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:18,278
But for some reason it seemed important to save this one, so I go on.

676
01:14:20,991 --> 01:14:23,733
"We're not so very different you and I.

677
01:14:25,412 --> 01:14:27,027
We've both spent our lives

678
01:14:27,164 --> 01:14:30,497
looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems."

679
01:14:33,753 --> 01:14:35,869
"Don't you think it's time to recognise

680
01:14:36,006 --> 01:14:40,466
there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?"

681
01:14:53,565 --> 01:14:55,681
Never said a word.

682
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:04,030
Not one word.

683
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:15,917
And the next morning he got back on his plane.

684
01:15:17,422 --> 01:15:20,209
He handed the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched.

685
01:15:20,342 --> 01:15:24,381
This was a chain-smoker, you may mind.

686
01:15:24,512 --> 01:15:28,721
And he flew off to what he presumed would be his death.

687
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,431
He kept my lighter.

688
01:15:38,318 --> 01:15:40,024
It was a gift.

689
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,362
"To George from Ann.

690
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,650
All my love."

691
01:15:51,873 --> 01:15:53,488
That was Karla.

692
01:15:55,752 --> 01:15:58,459
He went back to die rather than giving in.

693
01:16:01,341 --> 01:16:04,083
Yes, and that's how I know he can be beaten.

694
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:10,263
Because he's a fanatic.

695
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:15,678
And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.

696
01:16:21,486 --> 01:16:23,101
What did he look like?

697
01:16:25,365 --> 01:16:27,321
I can't remember.

698
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:51,088
After today, Peter,

699
01:16:52,517 --> 01:16:54,974
you have to assume they're watching you.

700
01:17:00,608 --> 01:17:02,894
If there's anything you need tidied up,

701
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:09,230
now is the time.

702
01:17:23,715 --> 01:17:25,330
Nearly done.

703
01:17:26,718 --> 01:17:28,424
For God's sake.

704
01:17:32,349 --> 01:17:35,762
Sometimes I think they're all sharing the same moronic brain.

705
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:49,062
If there's someone else, you can tell me.

706
01:17:51,659 --> 01:17:53,445
I'm a grown-up.

707
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:34,654
I know. It's just going to be such a wonderful Christmas.

708
01:18:34,786 --> 01:18:36,276
Excuse me.

709
01:18:43,795 --> 01:18:47,834
# And I was too proud to give in #

710
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:58,428
# I had to learn the hard way #

711
01:19:00,728 --> 01:19:02,764
Peter, when you're ready

712
01:19:02,897 --> 01:19:04,307
Put it on now.

713
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,770
Everybody!

714
01:20:23,811 --> 01:20:25,893
- Jerry. - George.

715
01:20:27,148 --> 01:20:28,513
- Peter. - Jerry.

716
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,601
I need to talk to you.

717
01:20:32,737 --> 01:20:35,319
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.

718
01:20:36,991 --> 01:20:39,323
You were duty officer, weren't you?

719
01:20:39,994 --> 01:20:43,907
Yeah. Control asked me to mind the phones that night.

720
01:20:44,999 --> 01:20:47,832
He said someone was doing a special job for the service.

721
01:20:47,961 --> 01:20:49,747
He wanted someone he could trust.

722
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,668
'Hurricane Henry set to be ridden by Ray Walsh at 7:2...'

723
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:28,990
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

724
01:21:31,004 --> 01:21:33,541
This is from the FO resident clerk.

725
01:21:33,673 --> 01:21:36,164
A Hungarian news bulletin.

726
01:21:36,301 --> 01:21:38,462
"British spy, work name Ellis,

727
01:21:38,595 --> 01:21:40,756
travelling with false Hungarian papers,

728
01:21:40,888 --> 01:21:45,598
has attempted to kidnap an unnamed Hungarian General in Budapest.

729
01:21:46,686 --> 01:21:48,677
He's been shot.

730
01:21:48,813 --> 01:21:50,895
Other arrests imminent."

731
01:21:54,652 --> 01:21:56,734
Can I have a brief, please?

732
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:02,072
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

733
01:22:10,543 --> 01:22:13,000
I couldn't get a word out of Control.

734
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:16,246
So I followed protocol and went for the emergency list.

735
01:22:19,469 --> 01:22:21,551
You rang my house.

736
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,170
Just on the off-chance you were back from Berlin.

737
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:25,717
What did you say?

738
01:22:26,643 --> 01:22:28,725
- Hello? - Hello, Mrs Smiley.

739
01:22:28,853 --> 01:22:30,935
It's Jerry. Jerry Westerby from the office.

740
01:22:31,064 --> 01:22:33,350
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

741
01:22:33,483 --> 01:22:35,565
Ann said you wasn't back yet and that was it.

742
01:22:36,778 --> 01:22:37,858
Go on.

743
01:22:37,987 --> 01:22:39,523
All hell broke loose.

744
01:22:39,656 --> 01:22:42,113
Military yelling about Hungarian tanks on the border.

745
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:44,857
Lacon and the minister baying at the door.

746
01:22:45,745 --> 01:22:48,452
Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

747
01:22:48,581 --> 01:22:49,787
- Mr. Haydon.  - Not now.

748
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:51,281
Mr. Haydon!

749
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:53,824
Out!

750
01:22:55,755 --> 01:22:57,541
- Tell me. - I tried to get hold of you.

751
01:22:57,674 --> 01:23:00,837
I got half a story on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.

752
01:23:02,053 --> 01:23:03,918
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

753
01:23:08,518 --> 01:23:10,383
Get me the Hungarian embassy.

754
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,351
You go and tell your masters what will happen

755
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,345
if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged.

756
01:23:14,482 --> 01:23:17,394
Get Esterhase on the phone. Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

757
01:23:17,527 --> 01:23:18,516
Yes, sir.

758
01:23:30,623 --> 01:23:33,160
Any more news on him? Sir?

759
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:39,587
Oh, God.

760
01:23:39,716 --> 01:23:42,378
We need to get down to his flat, clear out anything linked.

761
01:24:24,677 --> 01:24:27,669
Haydon heard the news at his club?

762
01:24:27,677 --> 01:24:28,669
It's arguable. 

763
01:24:29,223 --> 01:24:32,135
At 1: 30? The ticker-tape wouldn't have been running.

764
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:33,974
So how did he know?

765
01:24:35,605 --> 01:24:37,061
- Jesus, George.  - Peter!

766
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:39,727
- Jesus Christ! How could he have known?  - It's not what you think.

767
01:24:39,859 --> 01:24:43,772
- Then how did he know?  - Because he was at my house that night.

768
01:25:13,893 --> 01:25:15,975
Good flight?

769
01:25:18,689 --> 01:25:20,600
Yes.

770
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:22,689
Pleasant enough.

771
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:24,684
I was just passing. I thought I'd call in.

772
01:25:25,613 --> 01:25:28,855
Ann was in bed. She insisted on getting up.

773
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:31,232
She said she'd be down in a minute.

774
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:36,533
That's what I'm dropping off. It's an awful daub really.

775
01:25:38,251 --> 01:25:40,537
But Ann expressed a liking.

776
01:25:43,548 --> 01:25:45,504
What's keeping her?

777
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:03,559
Keep going.

778
01:26:04,735 --> 01:26:06,851
Come on, lads. Keep up.

779
01:26:09,782 --> 01:26:11,568
Come on, Bill!

780
01:26:24,714 --> 01:26:27,376
- Got your specs on, Jumbo?  - Yes, sir.

781
01:26:27,508 --> 01:26:29,123
Come here.

782
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,716
Who's that fellow down there?

783
01:26:39,353 --> 01:26:41,594
I don't know, sir.

784
01:26:41,731 --> 01:26:43,767
Who is he?

785
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,765
Beggar man?

786
01:26:45,902 --> 01:26:47,358
Thief?

787
01:26:48,988 --> 01:26:51,604
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

788
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:55,575
Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car round a field?

789
01:26:56,746 --> 01:27:00,113
What's the matter with him? Doesn't he like us?

790
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:03,286
I don't hold with odd-bods hanging around.

791
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:06,001
He might steal the Alvis.

792
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:08,416
- Which is?  - The best car in England, sir.

793
01:27:12,053 --> 01:27:13,634
Good lad.

794
01:27:23,022 --> 01:27:27,015
How were you briefed for the Budapest mission?

795
01:27:27,151 --> 01:27:30,188
Control asked me to come to a flat in Kensington.

796
01:27:32,782 --> 01:27:35,398
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

797
01:27:37,411 --> 01:27:39,447
And we have to find it.

798
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:44,665
What did you make of it, Jim?

799
01:27:44,794 --> 01:27:46,785
Control's theory?

800
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:50,913
I thought it was madness.

801
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:55,464
I know that it is one of five men.

802
01:27:57,014 --> 01:28:00,802
All I want from you is one code name.

803
01:28:07,817 --> 01:28:13,102
Alleline. Tinker.

804
01:28:13,823 --> 01:28:18,649
Haydon. Tailor.

805
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:25,823
Bland. Soldier.

806
01:28:27,253 --> 01:28:30,086
We drop Sailor. It's too close to Tailor.

807
01:28:30,214 --> 01:28:32,375
And Rich Man doesn't seem to be applicable.

808
01:28:34,427 --> 01:28:40,088
Esterhase. Poor Man.

809
01:28:45,521 --> 01:28:47,136
And the fifth?

810
01:28:49,442 --> 01:28:50,932
Smiley.

811
01:28:54,864 --> 01:28:56,900
I thought it was madness.

812
01:28:58,325 --> 01:29:01,442
To think that any one of you could have been a traitor.

813
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:04,700
Absolute madness.

814
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:09,542
But you still went.

815
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,786
Why? 

816
01:29:11,922 --> 01:29:15,085
I went because Control asked me to go.

817
01:29:15,217 --> 01:29:17,708
It's called doing one's duty.

818
01:29:28,856 --> 01:29:33,725
At the station I met the legman who was supposed to take me to the General.

819
01:29:33,861 --> 01:29:35,852
The waiter must have panicked.

820
01:29:35,988 --> 01:29:37,899
It was meant to be a simple snatch job.

821
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:47,196
They drove me to some military hospital,

822
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:50,120
and then put me on a transport plane.

823
01:29:50,252 --> 01:29:52,538
I could tell by the stars we were heading east.

824
01:29:57,093 --> 01:29:59,129
Then they worked me for...

825
01:30:01,472 --> 01:30:03,963
I don't know how long.

826
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,307
Weeks, maybe months.

827
01:30:46,642 --> 01:30:48,428
What did you tell them?

828
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:51,560
Everything.

829
01:30:53,858 --> 01:30:57,817
I held on for as long as I could to let everyone get the hell out of there.

830
01:30:59,989 --> 01:31:01,399
Did they?

831
01:31:02,575 --> 01:31:05,362
My network s in Hungary, did they get out?

832
01:31:08,164 --> 01:31:10,200
No, they were blown.

833
01:31:12,418 --> 01:31:16,081
The story is you blew them to save your own skin.

834
01:31:23,637 --> 01:31:28,631
After the interrogators had cleared out, this little fellow turned up.

835
01:31:30,686 --> 01:31:32,642
Looked like a priest.

836
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:36,522
That's when they really started on me.

837
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:40,268
What was your last line of defence, hmm?

838
01:31:41,864 --> 01:31:43,525
The mole.

839
01:31:44,909 --> 01:31:47,025
Control's crazy theory.

840
01:31:49,079 --> 01:31:52,617
I was going to bury that so deep they'd never get it out of me.

841
01:31:54,543 --> 01:31:57,410
- Which was a joke.  - Why?

842
01:31:59,089 --> 01:32:01,455
Because they already knew.

843
01:32:01,592 --> 01:32:05,130
All they wanted to know was how far Control had got in his investigation.

844
01:32:20,903 --> 01:32:22,689
No, I don't know her.

845
01:32:43,175 --> 01:32:46,292
Did they ask about me at all?

846
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:47,918
Yes.

847
01:32:48,931 --> 01:32:50,922
The little fellow did.

848
01:32:53,185 --> 01:32:56,097
What did he say about me?

849
01:32:57,690 --> 01:32:59,931
He had this cigarette lighter.

850
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,102
He kept flashing it about for me to see it.

851
01:33:05,364 --> 01:33:07,605
Showed me the inscription.

852
01:33:07,741 --> 01:33:09,948
- "To George..."  - "... from Ann."

853
01:33:11,412 --> 01:33:13,118
"All my love."

854
01:33:19,003 --> 01:33:20,459
Karla.

855
01:33:51,327 --> 01:33:53,363
It was odd.

856
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:57,412
They sent me back to England.

857
01:33:57,541 --> 01:34:00,123
Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.

858
01:34:02,921 --> 01:34:07,915
He said when he was being debriefed at the nursery, he had a visitor.

859
01:34:08,052 --> 01:34:09,212
Who?

860
01:34:09,345 --> 01:34:12,212
Toby Esterhase.

861
01:34:12,348 --> 01:34:15,010
He gave him 1,000 and an Alvis.

862
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:19,393
Told him he was dead now. Couldn't come back.

863
01:34:19,521 --> 01:34:23,013
Had to become a lotus eater, forget everything that happened.

864
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:25,015
Control's theory.

865
01:34:25,152 --> 01:34:27,359
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.

866
01:34:28,781 --> 01:34:31,397
Yes, that's what I thought.

867
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:35,822
How on earth did Esterhase hear about Tinker, Tailor?

868
01:34:52,429 --> 01:34:54,636
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

869
01:34:54,765 --> 01:34:58,098
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

870
01:34:58,227 --> 01:35:00,639
She told me Karla was very proud of this.

871
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:03,979
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

872
01:35:09,613 --> 01:35:11,729
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

873
01:35:11,865 --> 01:35:14,777
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

874
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:18,118
No, I had a hotel nearby. They do have some seedy rooms.

875
01:35:18,247 --> 01:35:20,283
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

876
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:23,954
everybody on the top floor was laughing themselves sick.

877
01:35:24,086 --> 01:35:25,997
She told me Karla was very proud of this... 

878
01:36:02,624 --> 01:36:05,036
She said everything the Circus thinks is gold is shit.

879
01:36:35,324 --> 01:36:38,532
This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear?

880
01:36:39,703 --> 01:36:41,318
Perfectly, Minister.

881
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:51,208
There is a house somewhere in this city

882
01:36:52,341 --> 01:36:56,050
where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative.

883
01:36:56,178 --> 01:36:58,294
I thought Lacon had made it clear to you.

884
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:02,048
Keep your nose bloody well out of Witchcraft's business.

885
01:37:02,184 --> 01:37:04,015
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

886
01:37:04,144 --> 01:37:06,726
You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.

887
01:37:06,855 --> 01:37:11,519
I wouldn't consider that sound advice, given the mess Control left us with.

888
01:37:12,653 --> 01:37:16,862
It has taken Alleline and, if I may say so, myself

889
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:19,026
this long to get us back in the game.

890
01:37:20,202 --> 01:37:24,161
The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov.

891
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:31,752
You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you.

892
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:36,749
His real role is to receive information from the mole

893
01:37:36,885 --> 01:37:38,466
to take back to Karla.

894
01:37:39,846 --> 01:37:43,259
That, er... that's not possible.

895
01:37:43,392 --> 01:37:45,007
Made possible.

896
01:37:45,143 --> 01:37:48,556
By you in the House which you persuaded the Treasury to pay for.

897
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:54,650
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine. It's been gold.

898
01:37:54,778 --> 01:37:59,067
It's just enough glitter amongst the chicken feed.

899
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:02,066
Control didn't believe in miracles or in Witchcraft.

900
01:38:02,202 --> 01:38:03,942
But you were lazy and you were greedy,

901
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,163
and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.

902
01:38:10,877 --> 01:38:15,086
You opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans.

903
01:38:15,215 --> 01:38:18,878
What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin.

904
01:38:19,011 --> 01:38:24,472
Witchcraft's information, the "gold" Karla let you have,

905
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,716
it wasn't to lure you.

906
01:38:26,852 --> 01:38:29,093
It was to lure the Americans.

907
01:38:31,273 --> 01:38:32,979
Now,

908
01:38:33,108 --> 01:38:35,224
do you want to take credit for that?

909
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,605
What can we do?

910
01:38:44,036 --> 01:38:47,824
We have one thing the mole wants.

911
01:38:51,043 --> 01:38:52,374
- If I go to Paris...  - You'll go.

912
01:38:52,502 --> 01:38:55,289
If I go to Paris,

913
01:38:57,049 --> 01:38:59,540
I want your word that you will get Irina back.

914
01:39:01,094 --> 01:39:04,678
I don't care who you have to trade. And I am out.

915
01:39:07,225 --> 01:39:11,514
I want a family, thank you. I do not want to end up like you lot.

916
01:39:11,647 --> 01:39:13,933
You will get her back.

917
01:39:16,818 --> 01:39:19,309
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

918
01:39:44,346 --> 01:39:46,462
Oh, hello, George.

919
01:39:47,599 --> 01:39:49,055
Hello.

920
01:40:15,001 --> 01:40:17,413
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

921
01:40:20,424 --> 01:40:23,416
Control recruited you, didn't he?

922
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:26,715
Found you starving in a museum in Vienna.

923
01:40:26,847 --> 01:40:29,384
A wanted man.

924
01:40:29,516 --> 01:40:31,552
Saved your life, I heard.

925
01:40:32,728 --> 01:40:34,844
And yet when the time came,

926
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:37,392
when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline,

927
01:40:37,524 --> 01:40:39,435
you didn't hesitate.

928
01:40:40,527 --> 01:40:44,236
That's understandable, perhaps, with your war experience.

929
01:40:44,364 --> 01:40:49,108
You survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides.

930
01:40:49,244 --> 01:40:51,326
Serve any master.

931
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,667
What? What's... What's this about, George?

932
01:41:00,756 --> 01:41:03,998
It's about which master you've been serving, Toby.

933
01:41:08,013 --> 01:41:10,629
Intelligence has been leaked, Toby.

934
01:41:10,766 --> 01:41:13,633
Someone's been taking files from the Circus.

935
01:41:13,769 --> 01:41:15,976
No, no, no, no. No.

936
01:41:16,104 --> 01:41:17,844
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.

937
01:41:17,981 --> 01:41:21,439
Files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?

938
01:41:21,568 --> 01:41:22,683
Yes.

939
01:41:24,571 --> 01:41:27,233
And, yes, I delivered them.

940
01:41:32,788 --> 01:41:35,029
But so did Percy Alleline.

941
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,160
Good boy.

942
01:41:41,296 --> 01:41:43,412
Bill Haydon.

943
01:41:45,175 --> 01:41:47,257
And so did Roy Bland.

944
01:41:57,062 --> 01:41:59,553
Things aren't always what they seem, George.

945
01:41:59,689 --> 01:42:01,680
You should know that.

946
01:42:01,817 --> 01:42:04,229
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...

947
01:42:08,448 --> 01:42:10,484
working for them.

948
01:42:10,617 --> 01:42:13,108
Every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them.

949
01:42:13,245 --> 01:42:15,657
Chicken feed, just to keep his bosses happy.

950
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:21,325
But Polyakov's our Joe.

951
01:42:21,461 --> 01:42:25,170
- He's a part of a big operation.  - Operation Witchcraft.

952
01:42:26,132 --> 01:42:27,668
Yes, I know.

953
01:42:28,677 --> 01:42:30,292
George.

954
01:42:30,428 --> 01:42:33,215
- Please, I don't deserve this.  - Who gave you the message

955
01:42:33,348 --> 01:42:36,090
for Jim Prideaux to forget about Tinker, Tailor?

956
01:42:36,226 --> 01:42:38,558
- Bland.  - To get rid of Connie Sachs?

957
01:42:38,687 --> 01:42:40,393
- Westerby?  - Bland.

958
01:42:40,522 --> 01:42:42,729
Or Haydon.

959
01:42:42,858 --> 01:42:44,689
I don't know. One of them.

960
01:42:45,902 --> 01:42:47,767
Or maybe Percy. No.

961
01:42:47,904 --> 01:42:50,611
Well, I don't know who.

962
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,947
You're just the messenger.

963
01:42:54,035 --> 01:42:56,651
Running between them all.

964
01:42:56,788 --> 01:42:59,245
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

965
01:43:00,542 --> 01:43:02,908
I know all about your secret source.

966
01:43:04,713 --> 01:43:06,749
And I know something you don't.

967
01:43:08,758 --> 01:43:10,919
I know who he is.

968
01:43:13,305 --> 01:43:15,387
He's Karla.

969
01:43:23,148 --> 01:43:27,562
One of you has been giving Polyakov the crown jewels. 

970
01:43:27,694 --> 01:43:30,811
- I did not know.  - Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

971
01:43:30,947 --> 01:43:34,815
- Look, George, I didn't know. I...  - You picked the wrong side.

972
01:43:34,951 --> 01:43:36,816
No, you've got to believe me.

973
01:43:36,953 --> 01:43:39,285
George, please.

974
01:43:43,418 --> 01:43:45,579
I am loyal.

975
01:43:46,338 --> 01:43:48,704
I... I am loyal.

976
01:43:59,768 --> 01:44:02,180
Don't... Don't... Don't send me back.

977
01:44:02,312 --> 01:44:04,177
Please, George.

978
01:44:05,065 --> 01:44:06,805
Don't send me back.

979
01:44:12,322 --> 01:44:14,404
Give me the address.

980
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:20,031
Where do you meet Polyakov?

981
01:44:33,593 --> 01:44:35,959
Hey, hey! Dog, dog, be quiet!

982
01:44:37,055 --> 01:44:39,842
What is this? Who are you?

983
01:44:41,783 --> 01:44:43,842
- Mrs Crave?  - Yes?

984
01:44:57,575 --> 01:44:59,987
- What are the safety signals?  - The air vent.

985
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:02,486
Open and all's well, closed and you're not to enter.

986
01:45:06,084 --> 01:45:08,370
And the microphone?

987
01:45:15,301 --> 01:45:16,666
Peter?

988
01:45:33,278 --> 01:45:36,270
The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled;

989
01:45:36,406 --> 01:45:38,863
The flame that lit the battle's wreck shone brightly o'er the dead.

990
01:45:39,826 --> 01:45:43,193
Yet beautiful and bright he stood as born to rule the storm;

991
01:45:43,329 --> 01:45:46,571
A creature of heroic blood, a proud, though childlike form

992
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:49,370
The flames roll'd on...

993
01:46:00,555 --> 01:46:03,467
Merci. Au revoir.

994
01:46:36,591 --> 01:46:38,172
Go on.

995
01:46:46,101 --> 01:46:48,092
The whole service is looking for you.

996
01:46:48,228 --> 01:46:51,595
- They'll skin you alive if they find you.  - Maybe I want them to find me.

997
01:46:53,316 --> 01:46:56,479
You can go now. Leave the books and put the keys in the machines.

998
01:46:56,611 --> 01:46:59,273
No, Ben stays here.

999
01:46:59,405 --> 01:47:04,775
Ricki Tarr claims to have information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

1000
01:47:27,058 --> 01:47:28,969
Mr Smiley? 

1001
01:47:31,437 --> 01:47:32,802
Taxi approaching Circus.

1002
01:47:45,243 --> 01:47:46,653
Tinker.

1003
01:47:57,589 --> 01:47:59,375
Tailor.

1004
01:48:04,679 --> 01:48:06,419
Here comes Soldier.

1005
01:48:11,186 --> 01:48:12,801
Full house.

1006
01:48:25,617 --> 01:48:31,408
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.  - Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

1007
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:36,874
Require clarification before meeting your request.

1008
01:48:38,004 --> 01:48:44,045
Quote, information vital to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote

1009
01:48:45,345 --> 01:48:49,588
does not qualify, send further information.

1010
01:48:49,724 --> 01:48:52,807
Ah! That's it, Percy, you keep stalling.

1011
01:48:52,936 --> 01:48:55,769
I warn you, Ben. We've got some really lousy people in this outfit.

1012
01:48:55,897 --> 01:48:58,138
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

1013
01:49:06,074 --> 01:49:08,235
The meeting's over.

1014
01:49:10,662 --> 01:49:12,573
They're leaving.

1015
01:53:13,946 --> 01:53:16,153
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

1016
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:21,693
I keep thinking how much I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.

1017
01:53:28,419 --> 01:53:32,879
I was rather hoping you might do a little light housekeeping for me.

1018
01:53:34,675 --> 01:53:36,336
If I can.

1019
01:53:37,094 --> 01:53:41,679
There's a girl. Give her some money, would you?

1020
01:53:41,807 --> 01:53:44,014
And give her a good cover story.

1021
01:53:46,229 --> 01:53:49,062
If it helps, tell her I love her.

1022
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:50,896
It's all there.

1023
01:53:51,025 --> 01:53:55,109
And there's a boy, too. Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

1024
01:53:57,448 --> 01:54:01,532
I know the inquisitors' bag of tricks. I taught most of them.

1025
01:54:04,163 --> 01:54:06,199
It's just a reaction.

1026
01:54:08,167 --> 01:54:10,704
An over-reaction, if you like.

1027
01:54:10,836 --> 01:54:13,543
I did have one or two questions.

1028
01:54:17,385 --> 01:54:19,250
- About Prideaux.  - Goddamn it!

1029
01:54:19,387 --> 01:54:22,299
- I got him back, didn't I?  - Yes, yes, you did.

1030
01:54:22,383 --> 01:54:25,183
That's good of you.

1031
01:54:25,476 --> 01:54:28,718
I am surprised Karla didn't have him shot.

1032
01:54:30,231 --> 01:54:33,018
Or do you think he held back,

1033
01:54:33,150 --> 01:54:35,732
out of delicacy towards you?

1034
01:54:39,407 --> 01:54:44,026
Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on the Hungarian mission?

1035
01:54:46,581 --> 01:54:48,913
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

1036
01:54:51,586 --> 01:54:53,577
To say what?

1037
01:54:59,051 --> 01:55:00,916
To warn you.

1038
01:55:02,847 --> 01:55:05,429
Because he knew deep down

1039
01:55:06,642 --> 01:55:08,598
it was you all along.

1040
01:55:13,107 --> 01:55:15,393
So did you.

1041
01:55:19,405 --> 01:55:21,817
I had to pick a side, George.

1042
01:55:23,492 --> 01:55:26,780
It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one.

1043
01:55:28,122 --> 01:55:31,205
And the West has become so very ugly.

1044
01:55:32,335 --> 01:55:34,075
Don't you think?

1045
01:55:35,796 --> 01:55:39,380
Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?

1046
01:55:39,508 --> 01:55:41,840
I'm not his bloody office boy!

1047
01:55:41,969 --> 01:55:44,460
What are you, then, Bill?

1048
01:55:51,103 --> 01:55:53,344
I'm someone who's made his mark.

1049
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:11,783
Is there anything particular you want me to pass on to Ann?

1050
01:56:15,544 --> 01:56:20,038
Oh, that was nothing personal, George. I hope you understand that.

1051
01:56:20,174 --> 01:56:22,540
Karla said you were good,

1052
01:56:22,677 --> 01:56:25,794
the one we had to worry about.

1053
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:29,388
But you do have a blind spot.

1054
01:56:29,517 --> 01:56:31,883
He reckoned if I was known to be Ann's lover,

1055
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:36,262
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

1056
01:56:37,858 --> 01:56:39,723
And he was right.

1057
01:56:41,153 --> 01:56:43,109
Up to a point.

1058
01:56:46,617 --> 01:56:48,357
Up to a point.

1059
01:57:15,604 --> 01:57:17,560
I made this for you, sir.

1060
01:57:26,365 --> 01:57:29,448
I don't want you hanging around here any more.

1061
01:57:31,245 --> 01:57:33,452
Keep away from me from now on.

1062
01:57:34,874 --> 01:57:37,456
- Go and join the others.  - But...

1063
01:57:37,585 --> 01:57:40,452
Just... Just bloody join in, will you?

1064
01:57:44,175 --> 01:57:46,757
Go and play, damn you!

1065
01:58:04,236 --> 01:58:06,898
Could you check, Jerry?
