1
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:38,643
Hello.

2
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:39,769
<i>Mr. Blake, please.</i>

3
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,271
Blake?

4
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:44,983
I don't think there's
mister ...there's Tony?

5
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:46,610
Here.

6
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:53,325
<i>Mr. Blake, we booked in 103.</i>

7
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:55,869
Who?

8
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:57,453
I've got to go.

9
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:58,329
It's about six.

10
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,164
No way.

11
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,332
No more than four.

12
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,792
Jesus Christ, don't bother
me with this kind of crap,

13
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:03,794
okay.

14
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:08,590
No bye-byes?

15
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:09,967
No, no bye-byes.

16
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:11,425
Can I call you sometime?

17
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,511
Any time.

18
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:14,971
What's your name?

19
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:15,973
Felicity.

20
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:26,191
Back to your boyfriend,
Felicity darling.

21
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,844
What's his name,
what's his name?

22
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:56,513
The stud

23
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:28,837
He's the stud,

24
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:32,591
stud

25
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:36,010
What's his game,

26
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,179
what's his game?

27
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:39,848
Stud

28
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:16,093
Stud

29
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:20,012
Hello my pretty.

30
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,722
And I have to start, boy,
who plays the brake down.

31
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:23,140
But I'm moving, even
if I have to push it.

32
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,143
But I nearly started to
write that ticket for you.

33
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:27,229
Oh, just try and
see if it works.

34
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:32,567
It works.

35
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:57,050
He is the stud...

36
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,596
Stud...

37
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,268
What's his game,
what's his game?

38
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,146
Stud...

39
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:21,616
Oh Charlie.
And I'd tell you wildly.

40
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:45,639
Come on, come on,
let's have it.

41
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,059
The little punters
are on their way.

42
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:48,477
A very good set.

43
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,734
This is it.

44
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,069
Mr. Blake is very early.

45
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,487
What's the time again?

46
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:05,285
That little guy,
what's his name?

47
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:06,078
Lukeno.

48
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,871
Yeah, give him a jacket
tonight, all right?

49
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:08,914
Okay.

50
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,710
Mr. Blake, this came
for you yesterday.

51
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,259
Hey Claus, how is it going?

52
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:22,469
Top of the tree, man.

53
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:24,221
I'm going to whoop
their ass tonight.

54
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,516
Mr. Blake, there's a phone
call for you, Mrs. Khaled.

55
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,021
Yes, Mrs. Khaled?

56
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,023
You're never late
are you, lover.

57
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,235
The car is waiting for you.

58
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:40,278
So am I.

59
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:41,612
Put your coat on.

60
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:43,115
I don't want you
catching a cold.

61
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:47,201
Franco, reservations.

62
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,328
Yeah.

63
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,621
Miss Carla Casini,
she is coming tonight?

64
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:53,332
You put the wolves on a second
to best table last night,

65
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,208
my baby.

66
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,293
Never mind the backhanders
you put them back in oblivion

67
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:57,211
where they belong, all right?

68
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:58,213
Yes, Mr. Blake.

69
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,841
Yes, who is it?

70
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:02,758
Your mother, Mr. Blake.

71
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,803
All right, put her through.
Franco,

72
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:09,766
you've got Mike Rovani on the bad
side there explain that to me.

73
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:11,725
Yes, you put them in with the silk shirt

74
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:13,644
and the colors around

75
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:16,856
it may dye it pink a bit, my
handkerchiefs are a bit red.

76
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:18,858
Mr. Blake, he bounced
three checks last week.

77
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:20,276
He's not exactly
a good costumer.

78
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,194
Look, you know
who his old man is?

79
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:24,029
If he likes a client,
a couple of checks,

80
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,157
you let him, all right?

81
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:28,660
So put him on the
good side, all right?

82
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:29,702
Well Tony, all right.

83
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:30,537
Yes mom.

84
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:32,289
Christmas, what about it?

85
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,082
All right.

86
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,500
I'll try and make it.

87
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,209
I'll let you know.

88
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,419
All right.

89
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,421
Ta-ta.

90
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:41,381
Franco.
Si.

91
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,300
I've just got to
pop out for an hour.

92
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:46,094
Keep the mafia
more busy, will you?

93
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:46,613
Don't drop it,
will you, lover?

94
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:47,989
It's 5th Century.

95
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,491
You're wondering how
much it was worth,

96
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:51,493
weren't you?

97
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:53,911
It's not hard to
imagine what your thinking,

98
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:55,288
most of the time.

99
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:57,623
Well, I was thinking about
the weather now and again,

100
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:00,084
and I think about you
and what you're thinking.

101
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:02,545
Let's go and
discuss the weather then.

102
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:19,186
What's going on?

103
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:20,981
It's an emergency.

104
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:24,650
What's that?

105
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:27,279
That's your cue.

106
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:38,665
That's enough.

107
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,625
Oh, that's enough, Tony.

108
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,460
That's enough darling.

109
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:44,504
Come on.

110
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,133
Where's your husband then?

111
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:49,759
In Geneva.

112
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:51,636
What's he doing there?

113
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:52,929
Meeting his daughter.

114
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:56,725
Well I'm supposed to
be working in his club.

115
00:10:57,017 --> 00:11:00,228
It's my club and I can
take a loss for an hour.

116
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,689
You're supposed to
be looking at me.

117
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:08,194
That's right.

118
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:42,729
Was nice.

119
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:48,026

00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:16,025
Take care.
Okay.

169
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:17,819
Blake,

170
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:20,862
Mrs. Weinstein.
That's all right.

171
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:22,949
Franco, please tell Mr.
Blake Lord Newton is here.

172
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:27,954
Tony, it's a
privilege to see you.

173
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,956
I haven't got a reservation
but one doesn't go in the

174
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,874
afternoon but one's
going to go in the evening.

175
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,170
Molly darling, you
look like a dynamite.

176
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:38,213
I take it your unescorted.

177
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:40,215
What? No, no... I've got two
charming twins with me,

178
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:41,133
Nigel and Jeremy.

179
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,386
I suppose you know the rules
single gentlemen pull

180
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:44,887
the ladies in.

181
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:45,680
How are you?

182
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:46,888
Fine, fine.

183
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,599
Got a table for
me and the lad?

184
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,391
Absolutely.

185
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,226
Franco, table for Mr. Flynne.

186
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:52,645
Thanks, Tony.

187
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,563
Single gentlemen
pull the ladies,

188
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,148
it makes the other
gentlemen uptight.

189
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,774
Well, I never
pulled a lady in my life.

190
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,067
That's a bloody silly rule.

191
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:00,402
I don't make the rules.

192
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,112
Oh, nice to see you surely.

193
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:03,614
You can always
make an exception for a very

194
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:05,324
special pal, don't you?

195
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:07,284
Look, everyone
here is special.

196
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:09,369
Well, what if I
should jolly well decide to

197
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,621
cancel my membership then?

198
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:12,623
Well if that's how you feel.

199
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:15,292
No, no, no, no it's
only a joke, Tony.

200
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,002
Anytime, let me know.

201
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:17,711
Yes.

202
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,463
You'll know where we are
going when you're not so busy.

203
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:20,631
We'll go somewhere else.

204
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:23,216
Come along child,
we'll go down the road.

205
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:24,886
You love it, don't you?

206
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:25,927
Well, I deal
perks with like that.

207
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:28,013
I used to run my ass up for
them and they leave me for

208
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:29,556
money for a tip.

209
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:30,974
Waiter never forgets, eh.

210
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,600
How are you going?

211
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,394
Uh sneaking by.

212
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:35,604
Hello darling.

213
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:36,606
Good morning?

214
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:39,275
Hello, sweetheart.

215
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:40,443
Hi darling.

216
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:43,404
Hello sweetheart.

217
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,864
Jesus, you'd be sneaking by
the child offenses act

218
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:48,325
if they get me...
How are you doing?

219
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:49,868
Where did you find them?

220
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:50,744
There's nothing to it.

221
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:52,746
I just follow the school bus,
ran in a roll and wait till

222
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:55,208
they climb in, and they do.

223
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,460
You rob the cradle,
Hal robs the graveyard,

224
00:16:58,461 --> 00:16:59,336
what a pair.

225
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:00,671
You don't have to twist
their arm these days,

226
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:01,630
you know?

227
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,174
Can't hop down on the old
foggy before he complains.

228
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:06,176
I'll blame the lad on the
moral standards on the TV

229
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,845
and so do you?

230
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,763
Well, I'll blame it on
gray head women like you.

231
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:12,015
They ask for comics, not a bag
of sweet and you give them a

232
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:13,183
penthouse to have on my trade.

233
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:14,393
You're only young
once, you know.

234
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:17,480
That's what their
dad's keep tellin them.

235
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:21,400
Franco, get Mr. Marc's a
scotch and a milk shake for

236
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:22,192
his daughter.

237
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:23,276
I left my wallet in
my other suit, right?

238
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,529
Boy, doesn't matter honey.
A buddy of mine runs the club.

239
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,657
Hey Tony, meet Maxine.
She runs Springs.

240
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,366
Oh, this is a nice place.

241
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,244
She is loaded.

242
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:32,078
What?

243
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:32,703
Nothing.

244
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,454
Listen I want to talk
about the menu, right?

245
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:38,750
Now she's... oh yeah,
hail to the chick.

246
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,335
Good evening, Mrs. Khaled.

247
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:42,504
Ah, Good evening, Franco.

248
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:44,340
Umm that's good.

249
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,052
Darling, you look fantastic.

250
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:49,845
You look divine.

251
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:51,805
We must have lunch someday.
Yes, darling. Call me.

252
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:57,562
He's good, there's nothing
else that I would rather be

253
00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:01,107
The greatest pleasures
teach us soon

254
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,319
He's in the top with you

255
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:09,240
Mrs. Khaled.
Do I smell mouthwash?

256
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:11,200
Just a little.

257
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,161
I didn't want to
spoil the flavor.

258
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,454
Why?

259
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,749
You reek of sex anyway,
it's your main attribute.

260
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:18,874
You're too kind.

261
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,959
Yes.

262
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:21,127
It's my main failing.

263
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:30,218
Franco, the music is much too loud.

264
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:31,262
Of course.

265
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:40,104
Tony.

266
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:42,023
Vanessa, darling.
Hello sweetheart,

267
00:18:42,148 --> 00:18:44,399
you look terrific.
You look terrific.

268
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,485
Tony.

269
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:48,028
This is Marc.

270
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:48,737
How'd you do Marc?

271
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:49,571
Welcome to the club.

272
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:50,781
Thank you.

273
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:51,990
Is Jeremy here?

274
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:52,783
Later.

275
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:54,075
Why don't you come through?

276
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:55,619
Life is very light.

277
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,914
Merry Christmas
and... we do our best.

278
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:00,207
How are you?

279
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,209
Hey, Leonard.

280
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,169
How are you?
Okay.

281
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:05,505
How was LA?

282
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,590
Sinking slowly into the sea
as far as I could tell,

283
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:09,592
too slowly.

284
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:11,511
That's Maxine behind me.

285
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:15,264
Thank you my darling.

286
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:19,811
Have you heard from
Benjamin, darling?

287
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:21,938
Yes, he called me
from Switzerland twice.

288
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:23,396
How's the novel coming on?

289
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:24,899
Page by page.

290
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,734
I see you brought your bit of
crimpy jail bait with you then dear.

291
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:30,111
Well, Denise... nah
she's an old age pensioner,

292
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:32,072
well preserved
like her highness.

293
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,448
Oh bitchy.

294
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,743
You better mind your tongue
dear she might bite it off.

295
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:36,535
Lucky her.

296
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:37,828
What did he say?

297
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:38,787
Faggot.

298
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:41,414
And how's little...
Alexandra?

299
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,499
Alexandra.

300
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,708
Is Alexandra liking Switzerland?

301
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:45,126
Well how the hell should I know?

302
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:46,670
She's his little
brat, not mine.

303
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:47,921
Go stay with
somebody your own age.

304
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,464
Because I saved him from...

305
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,883
You're a nice old geezer,
but you don't own me honey.

306
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:54,261
But then I judge other writers
by what they write...

307
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:56,179
myself, by my best intention.

308
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,514
What, the first Mrs. Khaled?

309
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:58,682
Is she in London then?

310
00:19:58,683 --> 00:19:59,307
No darling.

311
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:00,058
She's in Bark.

312
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:00,976
She is breeding pit ponies

313
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:03,311
and I understand they all
look exactly like her.

314
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,479
Oh beastly.

315
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,858
I think she's got
a stud there too.

316
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,027
This is a dance floor
not a geriatric pool.

317
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:11,278
All right.

318
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,405
That's enough, leave it out.

319
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:14,407
Hey, where the hell
are you taking him?

320
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:18,035
Please sit down.

321
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:19,703
Franco, get me and
my lady champagne.

322
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:20,996
She's dry from yelling.

323
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:21,663
Yes.

324
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:22,497
I'm right in.

325
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:24,125
Okay.

326
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:28,295
You can't leave him alone
for a moment, can you?

327
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:29,254
That's my job.

328
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:31,591
Well, come do a job with me.

329
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,145
I never could believe the
things you do to me

330
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:48,024
Never could believe
the way you are

331
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:50,943
Who is that?

332
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:52,777
That?

333
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:53,779
That's Molly.

334
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,573
Molly?

335
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,992
What a divine name.

336
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:02,163
Everyone's a winner,
baby, that's the truth

337
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:06,375
Making love to you is
such a thrill

338
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:11,339
Everyone's a winner,
baby, that's no lie

339
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,214
You never fail

340
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:14,759
Amazing creature.

341
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:19,889
Is she part of your job too?

342
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:36,197
Look at her.

343
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,245
Never could explain just what
was happening to me

344
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:47,374
Just one touch of you
and I'm in flames

345
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,460
Doesn't that give you a hard on?

346
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:57,885
My, my, my... I do believe
the boy is embarrassed.

347
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:04,809
Your very friendly
this evening madam.

348
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:06,726
Everyone's a winner, baby,
that's the truth

349
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,020
Was my good
enough for the lip?

350
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:15,277
Oh yes, it's about the one place
you are good enough, Tony?

351
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:20,282
Just bear that in
mind, won't you lover.

352
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,635
I'm leaving now tiger.

353
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:40,845
I'll call you tomorrow.

354
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:44,515
Oh and Tony turn
the music down.

355
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:45,933
It's much too loud.

356
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:50,187
Franco, get her bag.

357
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:51,939
Fontaine.

358
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:52,982
Oh dear.

359
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:53,858
How are you?

360
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,026
Well looking good was it.

361
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,528
Be good...
I will.

391
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,833
It could give me some of the
figures on this place

392
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:27,835
in the meantime.

393
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:29,128
Yeah, sure.

394
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:37,886
Moonlighting

395
00:23:37,887 --> 00:23:40,096
They're leaving
everything

396
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:41,556
Moonlighting

397
00:23:41,557 --> 00:23:43,475
They're losing
all their friends

398
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:45,186
Moonlighting

399
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:49,022
It's the only way
It's frightening

400
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:51,191
But it means they'll stay

401
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:58,199
Together They're gonna
make it together

402
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:00,076
I'm not in love,

403
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:03,829
so don't forget it

404
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:09,627
It's just a silly phase
I'm going through

405
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:13,505
And just because

406
00:24:13,506 --> 00:24:17,176
Sam... Nico.
Right.

407
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:21,222
I call you up
Don't get me wrong

408
00:24:21,722 --> 00:24:24,058
Don't think you've got it made

409
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:26,102
Where you from honey?

410
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,312
Center Page, of Playboy honey.

411
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:35,528
Oh, can't see
any staple marks.

412
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,031
Oh don't you know, they
touch us up afterwards.

413
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:42,034
That's the kind of job I like.

414
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:47,289
Looks like you've got it.

415
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:00,969
Not so hard Sandro.

416
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,096
Sorry madam but
there's so much tension.

417
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:04,889
I take Valium for
tension Sandro,

418
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,350
not punishment.

419
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:09,186
Why do you keep him?

420
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:10,229
Who?

421
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:11,564
Tony.

422
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:14,482
Darling, he's my masterpiece.

423
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:15,358
I own him.

424
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,153
I have turned a common waiter
into one of the most fancied

425
00:25:18,154 --> 00:25:21,573
young men in London, more
or less with my bare hands.

426
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:25,744
I totally redid
him, clothes, hair,

427
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:30,206
even sex, especially sex.

428
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:31,750
Do you know when
I first met him,

429
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:34,670
Tony thought that 69
was a bottle of scotch?

430
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:38,798
You're priceless.

431
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,801
Well, frightfully
expensive though.

432
00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:43,888
Then when do I have him?

433
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,935
Whenever you wish my darling,
unless it's not during club hours.

434
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:51,603
But wouldn't you be jealous?

435
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:53,980
Good God, it would be like
being jealous of a turnstile

436
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:55,357
at Regent's Park zoo.

437
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,737
I might even
arrange it for you.

438
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:02,906
Oh I've got
something to show you,

439
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:05,033
I think you'll be fascinated.

440
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:06,035
Will I?

441
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:11,540
Do I hurt you madam?

442
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,418
I realized Sandro that
this is not your intention,

443
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,004
but you're getting me excited.

444
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,676
It's all right Sandro,
just bring me the phone.

445
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,432
Hello.

446
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:30,600
Good morning lover.

447
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:31,559
Oh, it's you.

448
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,811
Are you up?

449
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:34,145
Yeah I'm awake but...

450
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:36,606
What do you mean 'but?

451
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:39,734
You're an early
riser, aren't you?

452
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:41,402
Good, then I'll
have all of it then,

453
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:42,654
I'm coming over.

454
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,364
Coming over,
coming over where?

455
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:48,118
Oh, I don't really
mind wherever... wherever,

456
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,830
besides I miss you.

457
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:54,332
I've been lying here
thinking about you,

458
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:58,170
and I'm ready, I'll be
around in 10 minutes.

459
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:01,757
God.

460
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:06,094
Hey, you do this
for a living huh?

461
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:07,304
Oh shut up.

462
00:27:08,472 --> 00:27:11,559
Oh, well, I got one for
free from a real professional.

463
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,436
Do I have to fill in
a form or something,

464
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:16,813
for your income tax?

465
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:17,981
Cut it out.

466
00:27:17,982 --> 00:27:20,525
No, I mean if it's any
easier I don't mind paying.

467
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:22,152
Do you take Access?

468
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:24,070
Several times last
night, didn't I?

469
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:27,198
Okay, suppose we put the
little extras down to Diners

470
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,200
Club then.

471
00:27:28,784 --> 00:27:30,995
It's not often I get the
chance to eat that much,

472
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:36,875
who does this
one charge it to.

473
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:38,877
Come on, it's not like that.

474
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:39,879
Sure I know?

475
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:43,298
You good looking
tarts are all the same.

476
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:44,967
Well, don't let me
keep you from your work.

477
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:06,321
I won't be long Sanders.

478
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:07,323
Very good, ma'am.

479
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,123
I've got 15 minutes Tony.

480
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:18,958
I'm late for the
hair dressers.

481
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,419
Christ, I'm not a
machine you know.

482
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,672
In the meantime
lover, you will do.

483
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:36,184
What are you wearing tonight?

484
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:38,186
Oh I don't know, anything.

485
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:41,606
Oh Fontaine you're
positively wicked,

486
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:43,107
you know that?

487
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:45,151
Yes, I am, aren't I?

488
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:47,737
I knew I should have
gone into the movies,

489
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:50,114
instead of wasting my
best years modeling,

490
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:51,616
they wanted me too.

491
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:54,327
How on earth did
you manage that?

492
00:28:54,328 --> 00:28:56,746
I can take a loss for an hour.

493
00:28:56,747 --> 00:29:00,250
Practice darling, endless
practice a bit like ballet

494
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:01,252
lessons.

495
00:29:01,627 --> 00:29:02,628
What's he doing?

496
00:29:06,423 --> 00:29:08,341
He's looking at his watch...

497
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:09,968
cocky little bastard.

498
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,719
Oh this isn't fair.

499
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,263
When are you going to
arrange him for me?

500
00:29:13,264 --> 00:29:13,721
Yeah.

501
00:29:13,722 --> 00:29:15,473
Maybe I'll give him
to you for Christmas.

502
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:17,267
You know I'm in Paris.

503
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,394
Oh yes I know.

504
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:20,980
Oh I love Paris.

505
00:29:25,025 --> 00:29:27,444
Oh, ah.

506
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:41,375
Oh shit.

507
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,379
You look like shit.

508
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,797
Yeah, I've had a busy day.

509
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,966
Still going
across the boss' wife.

510
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:51,259
You're playing a
mugs game, Tony.

511
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,510
She's got you both ways.

512
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:53,553
You can't even
blow the whistle,

513
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:54,220
right?

514
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,931
Anytime I want, I can go.

515
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:57,974
What happens then?

516
00:29:57,975 --> 00:29:59,935
All of sudden you're an
ex-manager of a night club.

517
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:01,770
She probably won't even
let you keep a jacket.

518
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:04,397
Might fit the next guy.

519
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,776
You got to use your head
first and your cock second.

520
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:10,362
Basic law of physics, that is.

521
00:30:11,947 --> 00:30:13,906
Christ.

522
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:15,450
Creeps up on you, doesn't it?

523
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:16,367
What?

524
00:30:16,368 --> 00:30:19,787
Age, darling, the
invisible enemy.

525
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:21,873
Don't be silly,
you look incredible.

526
00:30:21,874 --> 00:30:26,294
Hmm, I'm my own work of art.

527
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:29,922
Maybe if I could've had kids,
I'd be all nice and mummsy by

528
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:30,381
now.

529
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:32,259
I didn't know you
couldn't have kids.

530
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:36,929
Rather unfortunate
abortion, took care of that.

531
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:41,351
'Don't want them' sounds much
better than 'can't have them'.

532
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:44,020
Anyway at least I'm not
risking thrombosis from the

533
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:44,645
pill.

534
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:47,148
You always said
you hated kids.

535
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:49,942
Anyway, Leonard thinks you're
the most beautiful woman he's

536
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:51,736
ever seen.

537
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:53,738
Does he now?

538
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:56,408
You must remind me to
thank him properly.

539
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:00,745
Oh darling, you must
bring Tony to Paris,

540
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:02,623
then we can all have him.

541
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,167
All?

542
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,460
Maybe you should
take up the banjo,

543
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:08,669
Tony baby.

544
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,338
Always good to
have a second trade.

545
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,840
Nah... he's going to be a tap
dancer when the old trouser

546
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:14,301
snake lets him
down, ain't you tone.

547
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:18,096
Listen, you two toe rags.

548
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:20,765
In the not too distant future,
I'm going to make the pair of

549
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:22,434
you look like twin arseholes.

550
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:27,981
I've done the waiter bit,
I've done the manager a bit.

551
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:31,567
The next one is going
to have my name on it,

552
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:33,277
Tony's very own.

553
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,197
I've got a certain person to
put his limbs up and I'm going

554
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:37,449
to be making bread.

555
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:41,035
I'll blow the whistle on the
performing bit when I feel

556
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:43,121
like it right now I
don't feel like it.

557
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:44,915
I enjoy it, right?

558
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:46,417
End of story.

559
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:51,839
What's Glen like in bed?

560
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:55,633
Well, inventive.

561
00:31:55,634 --> 00:31:57,260
Inventive?

562
00:31:57,261 --> 00:31:58,553
Hmm.

563
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:00,722
I always thought he
was a trifle gay.

564
00:32:02,391 --> 00:32:06,519
I must say invention isn't
one of Tony's strong suits.

565
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,523
With him it's more of a matter
of... enthusiasm and staying

566
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:11,525
hard.

567
00:32:12,526 --> 00:32:14,944
You know, I think
Paris is a fantastic idea.

568
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:16,821
We could do some
Christmas shopping.

569
00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:17,947
I need a new coat.

570
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:19,408
What would you do about Ben?

571
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,619
Oh Ben... he'll be far too busy
fawning over his daughter to

572
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,329
worry about what I am doing.

573
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,583
He'll probably be grateful to
me for getting out his way.

574
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:30,585
Very considerate
of you, darling.

575
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:33,754
Do you mind if I
watch it again?

576
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:35,798
Now I know what I'm
getting for Christmas.

577
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:36,967
Be my guest.

578
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:47,143
About Fontaine
Khaled, she's using you.

579
00:32:47,144 --> 00:32:50,813
Listen, Fontaine
Khaled is a beautiful,

580
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:52,523
intelligent woman.

581
00:32:52,524 --> 00:32:54,150
She's a ball breaker.

582
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:55,818
She gave me a chance.

583
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:57,278
She wanted you to screw.

584
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,407
Eh, you're unhappy because I
pull beautiful ladies and you

585
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:03,534
have to pay for your cufflinks
by dicking over old age

586
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:04,536
pensions.

587
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:07,830
Don't tell me I'm schmuck.

588
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:09,582
It's only my hobby.

589
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,083
What are you doing
in your spare time,

590
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:12,169
make model airplanes?

591
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:16,547
All right, Warren Beatty,
you stick to your hobby.

592
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:19,175
You can nail it to the wall
when it doesn't work anymore.

593
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:21,344
That is unless
someone nails it for you.

594
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:22,720
Well, it won't be you.

595
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:25,224
You're too busy wheeling
bath chairs round now.

596
00:33:29,561 --> 00:33:32,313
Let me tell you something
about those old dragons.

597
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,982
Their husbands
are usually dead.

598
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:38,111
How's Mr. Khaled?

599
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:47,578
So, which bright young things
do we have the pleasure of

600
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:49,121
this evening?

601
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:52,500
Mario's is with Gordon
and Alex is with Peter,

602
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:53,502
of course.

603
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:55,545
Christ.

604
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:58,422
Another one of those
upper class itentikits.

605
00:33:58,423 --> 00:34:00,049
Peter's a very nice boy.

606
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:00,925
Alex likes him.

607
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:02,718
She always has done.

608
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,887
I think they are
very well suited.

609
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:07,266
Maybe they can all live
happily ever after then.

610
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:09,226
Is that <i>so</i> wrong?

611
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:12,436
It's all so boring.

612
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:13,062
He is boring.

613
00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:13,813
She's boring.

614
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:15,731
They all bore the arse of me.

615
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:18,651
I hope you won't be using
language like that in front of

616
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:19,402
her.

617
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:22,655
It's that puritanical attitude
of yours that makes me talk

618
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:23,906
like that around her.

619
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:26,325
You know she can't bare me to
be more attractive than her

620
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:27,410
own mother.

621
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:30,204
So you'll make it up to her
by treating me like a servant

622
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:31,331
whenever she's around.

623
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:35,502
Do I really treat
you like a servant?

624
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:38,714
Well, no.

625
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:43,634
No, not really.

626
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:47,346
But she doesn't like me and
you know I just can't help the

627
00:34:47,347 --> 00:34:48,848
way that makes me behave.

628
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:50,766
She won't be here for long.

629
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:54,312
But she is my daughter and I
can't refuse her to stay in my

630
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:55,439
house.

631
00:34:57,524 --> 00:34:59,650
Must you absolutely be
here until the New Years,

632
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:00,652
darling?

633
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,528
Yes, I'm afraid so, why?

634
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:06,532
Oh, Vanessa and Leonard
have asked us to Paris for

635
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:07,491
Christmas.

636
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:09,369
It would have been
divine if we could have gone.

637
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:11,579
Why don't you go?

638
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,999
Oh, it wouldn't be the same
without you after all it is

639
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,750
Christmas.

640
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:16,917
Don't be silly.

641
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:19,086
Do some shopping,
have a marvelous time,

642
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:20,631
you'll be back
by Christmas Eve.

643
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:27,053
Well, I shall have to
bring you something very,

644
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:28,305
very special then.

645
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:42,485
You get too much You get too
much And I know I'll get you

646
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:45,989
back And
gentleman in England...

647
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:48,991
Where is Mr. Blake?

648
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:49,742
He's in the store.

649
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:50,493
Go and get him.

650
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:56,999
We're not here in this piss
hole for you boring farts and

651
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,215
hold their manhood, see while
any speak of those who fart

652
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:08,136
and fight upon the
same Christians.

653
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:15,518
Oh Tony, get your bum
chums off and get Bowsy a

654
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,603
drinkington.

655
00:36:16,645 --> 00:36:21,400
Thank God for Harry,
England and Tony Blake.

656
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:24,528
Ladies and gentlemen...

657
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:28,865
Mr. Tony...

658
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,285
Take it easy Bowsy, please.

659
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:39,417
Hey Tony... why don't you and
I drop our trousers and see

660
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:41,252
whose got the
biggest willy in the room,

661
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:42,254
eh?

662
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,548
Come on, off we go.

663
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:50,387
You disappoint me, Blake.

664
00:36:51,263 --> 00:36:52,931
I thought you had more style.

665
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:58,895
He used to kiss my arse
when he was a waiter.

666
00:37:00,897 --> 00:37:04,735
You're nothing but a working
class bum in Gucci shoes.

667
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:12,450
Listen Franco, I don't want to
see his fat little face again.

668
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:14,326
Yeah, maybe it's best that...

669
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:15,244
If he wants to
shoot his mouth of,

670
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:17,663
he can go do it in the
House of Lords not in my club.

671
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:18,665
Right.

672
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:24,295
Don't let the ruling
classes ruffle your feathers,

673
00:37:24,296 --> 00:37:25,171
right.

674
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:26,505
Ah, Fontaine.

675
00:37:26,506 --> 00:37:28,257
Good evening, Tony.

676
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:30,176
We are going out for a party
so we shan't be here very

677
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:31,802
long, but let me
introduce you.

678
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:33,053
Hello.

679
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:36,098
And his sister,
Madeline, Gordon Brown,

680
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:38,100
and this is my
daughter Alexandra.

681
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:40,394
This is Tony Blake
who runs the club.

682
00:37:40,395 --> 00:37:43,731
Alex is a bit young for night
clubs but I don't think she'll

683
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:45,024
come to any harm here, do you?

684
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:46,066
Of course not.

685
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,026
Which one is Alex?

686
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:48,444
She is the one in
the fairy frock,

687
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:49,904
talking to Tony.

688
00:37:49,905 --> 00:37:51,071
Who is that man
being thrown out?

689
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,740
Oh, that was one of
our titled customers.

690
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:55,201
We get all the Lords and
Ladies and layabouts down

691
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:55,826
here.

692
00:37:55,827 --> 00:37:56,786
Do you?

693
00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:58,371
I don't seem to
recognize anybody.

694
00:37:59,456 --> 00:38:03,209
Well, they often look
different in real life.

695
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,586
Is this real life?

696
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:09,507
Peter was just telling
us about an expedition

697
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:10,341
he went on to.

698
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:11,342
Where was it Peter?

699
00:38:11,343 --> 00:38:13,177
They Hindu Kush, actually.

700
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:16,347
I think the younger generation
is very adventurous these

701
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:17,557
days.

702
00:38:20,185 --> 00:38:22,186
We took the train from Bombay.

703
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:24,146
Of course they are
still using steam trains.

704
00:38:24,147 --> 00:38:26,315
Do I get enamored
with a noble lord,

705
00:38:26,316 --> 00:38:29,652
Shakespeare in
flights, Henry five,

706
00:38:29,653 --> 00:38:30,820
one of the better moments.

707
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:33,072
I hate to hear one
of his worst moments.

708
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:34,698
You saw Mt Everest
too, didn't you?

709
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:36,575
I suppose it would
be hard to miss.

710
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:37,952
Well, it certainly
is quite a sight.

711
00:38:37,953 --> 00:38:39,913
You can see the main
peak for about 200 miles.

712
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:43,374
Goodness knows how anyone's
brave enough to climb the top.

713
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,918
I think they're all stoned
out of their minds before they

714
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:46,920
start.

715
00:38:47,754 --> 00:38:48,880
I think it's terrific.

716
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:57,054
I see it closing in the
morning before breakfast.

717
00:38:57,055 --> 00:38:58,514
She's awful.

718
00:38:58,515 --> 00:39:01,392
She was always giving me
those funny looks during P.E.

719
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:02,894
She was probably
a raving dyke,

720
00:39:04,938 --> 00:39:06,313
and I'm sure you'd
be very attracted to

721
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:06,981
that sort of person.

722
00:39:06,982 --> 00:39:08,649
Shall we go and dance, Gordon?

723
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,276
Well, actually I
don't dance very well,

724
00:39:10,277 --> 00:39:10,901
I'm afraid.

725
00:39:10,902 --> 00:39:12,653
Well go and dance, so that
they don't have to sit here

726
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:13,947
and watch you pick your teeth.

727
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:17,868
Is that alright?

728
00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:19,952
Yes of course, go
on enjoy yourself.

729
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:20,953
Come on Gordon.

730
00:39:20,954 --> 00:39:21,704
Well, what do you
think of the club?

731
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,581
Why did you make
fun of him like that?

732
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:26,710
Tony, beware of the
cock in the tail.

733
00:39:27,627 --> 00:39:29,546
God, Jesus.

734
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,635
Who is the princess then?

735
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,721
Oh hold on, Benjamin
Khaled's daughter,

736
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:40,180
now would you believe that.

737
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:41,725
Don't know if you
believe it yourself.

738
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:50,441
Now Alex darling however
Fontaine behaves to you

739
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:52,776
whatever she
does... she can never...

740
00:39:52,777 --> 00:39:53,819
Excuse me.

741
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,487
Have you seen, Madeline?

742
00:39:55,488 --> 00:39:57,573
I've seemed to have
lost her in the crush.

743
00:39:57,574 --> 00:39:58,742
Why don't you sit down.

744
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:02,036
She can never affect our
relationship you know that?

745
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:04,997
Daddy, I know that, but she's
so impossible and so rude to

746
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:05,748
my friends.

747
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:07,000
It's part of growing up.

748
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:09,710
How is the family
outing getting along?

749
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:11,295
Huh, wonderful.

750
00:40:11,296 --> 00:40:13,923
Little Miss Muffet and Winnie
the Pooh are making googoo

751
00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:14,965
eyes at each other.

752
00:40:14,966 --> 00:40:17,468
The other moron is taking
his horrific girlfriend for

753
00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:19,762
dancing lessons and I'm
behaving like a bitch.

754
00:40:19,763 --> 00:40:23,432
When Ben gives me his Arab
glares even Tony seems to have

755
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:24,600
turned to stone this evening.

756
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:26,811
Have you said
anything to Ben about Paris?

757
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:29,229
That's the one thing that's
kept me from screaming in his

758
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:29,563
face.

759
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:30,397
And he said yes?

760
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:31,733
He said yes.

761
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:34,234
I'm flying over
with you tomorrow.

762
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:34,860
Marvelous.

763
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:35,694
What did you tell him?

764
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:38,322
Oh, he thinks he's
doing it for Alexandra.

765
00:40:38,323 --> 00:40:42,409
So that I'm not around to
criticize the yodeling and she

766
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,329
can't bore me to death
with her sixth form brain.

767
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,040
And what about my Tony?

768
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,293
Your Tony... hmm.

769
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:54,338
Well, I think that we should
keep Tony in the dark until we

770
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:55,172
share him up.

771
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:57,508
You know, he's only used to
having one woman at a time.

772
00:40:57,509 --> 00:40:58,592
We wouldn't want to
frighten him off,

773
00:40:58,593 --> 00:40:59,551
would we?

774
00:40:59,552 --> 00:41:01,762
I love the TV special.

775
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:03,597
Has anyone else taped him?

776
00:41:03,598 --> 00:41:04,181
No.

777
00:41:04,182 --> 00:41:06,350
I think I'm the only one
who starred opposite him.

778
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:07,643
And you haven't
got Ben as well?

779
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:09,270
God forbid.

780
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,231
Ben gets his cock
sucked once a month,

781
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:15,402
always in the dark and
never ever in the lift.

782
00:41:17,988 --> 00:41:20,739
When he drop you off and
he said to you girl oh...

783
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,449
So this is Tony, eh?

784
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,325
Nice to meet you, Tony.

785
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:23,993
Nice to meet you.

786
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:25,160
Well, I'm just happy about it.

787
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,246
Oh thank you very much.

788
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:27,747
Mr. Blake.

789
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:29,748
How is it going my dear?

790
00:41:29,749 --> 00:41:31,250
There's too many
people in the restaurant.

791
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:32,501
Have you seen my wife?

792
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:33,210
No, I didn't.

793
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:34,838
She's always
fucking on somebody.

794
00:41:35,672 --> 00:41:36,463
Hello Tony.

795
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:38,008
Hello over here.

796
00:41:38,591 --> 00:41:39,466
There she's...

797
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:44,680
Ah, Vanessa, I should
like to go home now.

798
00:41:44,681 --> 00:41:45,848
No, we'll go and dance.

799
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:46,682
"Don't be such a drag.

800
00:41:46,683 --> 00:41:47,641
You're going to dance.

801
00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:48,977
Oh go and dance.

802
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:50,103
Come on, I'll practice here.

803
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:59,403
Making me rooms and why don't
you allow that These brand new

804
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:02,823
ones Out in the shadow
searching for someone For

805
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:07,411
someone To set you free
From New York City...

806
00:42:07,412 --> 00:42:08,746
Hi, Tony.

807
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:10,205
You're running
the club very good.

808
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:11,457
Is everything all right?

809
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:14,043
It's just be... it's just that
we have had another engagement

810
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:15,753
I can't keep them
waiting too long of course.

811
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:17,337
Ah superman.

812
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:18,881
What have you done with
your little girlfriend?

813
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:21,091
Well, I've sort of
lost her actually.

814
00:42:21,092 --> 00:42:23,052
Oh and I'm sure you'll find
her when they sweep up in the

815
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:24,054
morning.

816
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,304
I'll take out with some
service, all right.

817
00:42:25,305 --> 00:42:25,888
I'm going to Paris.

818
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:28,015
Oh thank you.

819
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:29,349
"Can I catch a lift, sir?

820
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,019
I think I should be
getting along as well.

821
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:32,937
Would be delighted to, yes.

822
00:42:35,482 --> 00:42:36,483
Your car's
waiting, sir

823
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:44,323
Hello stranger you are an
angel to the love I knew

824
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:45,325
Hello darling.

825
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,160
Hello.

826
00:42:47,285 --> 00:42:48,286
You want to dance?

827
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,662
Oh, no really I couldn't.

828
00:42:50,663 --> 00:42:51,330
Of course you could.

829
00:42:51,331 --> 00:42:52,332
No really.

830
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,084
How old are you?

831
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:56,085
I'm 16.

832
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:57,127
Awful, isn't it?

833
00:42:57,128 --> 00:42:59,004
Hmm, that's lovely.

834
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:00,006
You're a virgin?

835
00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:06,178
Well, fortunately
you're talking to a man who

836
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,264
specializes in
such diseases. Oh.

837
00:43:08,348 --> 00:43:13,727
Sorry, I'm a lady Sorry,
I'm a lady I would rather be

838
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:17,356
Rather be Just
a little shady

839
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:18,398
Just a little shady
Naughty dynamite

840
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,441
Who is he?

841
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:22,319
Oh, he wants me
to dance I think.

842
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,239
Bloody boots,
forget about dancing,

843
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,574
probably walking too.

844
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:29,451
I should have worn my flats.

845
00:43:29,452 --> 00:43:32,579
I'm so fed up with looking
like a cute little dumpling.

846
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,707
I want to be groove bit.

847
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:37,376
Can we go soon?

848
00:43:37,377 --> 00:43:38,961
Yes, I suppose so.

849
00:43:38,962 --> 00:43:40,129
Alex...

850
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,171
Franco, now she's gone.

851
00:43:41,172 --> 00:43:42,507
Turn the music up for me.

852
00:43:43,758 --> 00:43:44,759
Yes, sure.

853
00:43:57,021 --> 00:43:58,022
Well...

854
00:43:58,314 --> 00:43:59,315
Well...

855
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,151
Funny place, wasn't it?

856
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:03,153
What was funny?

857
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:06,864
Well, you know the...

858
00:44:06,865 --> 00:44:09,491
Oh, all those old
men and young girls.

859
00:44:09,492 --> 00:44:10,493
Sure.

860
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:12,203
Funny really.

861
00:44:13,037 --> 00:44:14,038
Peter.

862
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,331
Hmm.

863
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:16,666
Kiss me.

864
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:19,460
Yes, of course.

865
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:31,556
What's the matter?

866
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:33,349
Nothing, nothing.

867
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:45,736
Crikey.

868
00:44:45,737 --> 00:44:46,738
What's wrong?

869
00:44:49,324 --> 00:44:51,325
It's just that I don't want
Maddy to come out and find us

870
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:53,453
in the throws of fore play
before we're even engaged.

871
00:44:54,746 --> 00:44:56,289
Oh my God.

872
00:44:58,625 --> 00:44:59,626
The door.

873
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:02,003
Yes of course.

874
00:45:13,556 --> 00:45:14,973
What are you doing?

875
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:15,975
Oh it's you.

876
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,143
What is that?

877
00:45:18,144 --> 00:45:20,021
And you're supposed
to be looking after...

878
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:22,731
I was going to
tell right away,

879
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:23,774
really I was.

880
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:25,734
But you weren't here.

881
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:26,736
What you're doing?

882
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,155
I heard it all in the loo
and then we left with Peter,

883
00:45:30,156 --> 00:45:31,573
but I couldn't tell
you in front of him,

884
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:32,532
could I?

885
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:33,534
Heard what?

886
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:37,829
They were talking, she and
that rinsed out blond friend

887
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:38,831
of hers.

888
00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:42,168
They're going to Paris
with him for an orgy.

889
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:44,461
But I don't think
he knows it yet.

890
00:45:44,462 --> 00:45:47,839
I don't know if
Daddy would know.

891
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,341
Never let them
get away with it.

892
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:50,634
He doesn't know.

893
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:51,803
They said so.

894
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,264
She said he thinks she's going
to Paris to get out of your

895
00:45:55,265 --> 00:45:57,057
way really it's to...

896
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:58,059
what you're doing?

897
00:45:58,518 --> 00:46:01,228
It looks like he's
pretty good at it.

898
00:46:01,229 --> 00:46:03,063
"Which is more than
your brother can say.

899
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:06,400
Oh Alex you're not
going to ...not with him.

900
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:09,611
Fontaine would hate
it, wouldn't she?

901
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:12,322
She said she doesn't
care who he does it with.

902
00:46:12,323 --> 00:46:14,658
She says that's
what he is for.

903
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:16,493
We'll have to take
her word for it,

904
00:46:16,494 --> 00:46:17,495
wouldn't we?

905
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:21,790
Lying in my bed on the 40th
floor suddenly crunched

906
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:23,041
in through the window.

907
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:26,336
He flies covered in blood and
glass and I just can't believe

908
00:46:26,337 --> 00:46:27,338
what's happening.

909
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:29,632
I mean it's just the
most ridiculous thing.

910
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:32,759
Is Miss Khaled upstairs.

911
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,094
She wants to speak to you.

912
00:46:34,095 --> 00:46:34,845
Who?

913
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:36,722
Daughter of Mr. Khaled.

914
00:46:36,723 --> 00:46:38,974
Is she... alone?

915
00:46:38,975 --> 00:46:39,976
Yeah.

916
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,561
Champagne.

917
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,401
Hello.

918
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:49,902
Hi.

919
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,405
I hope I haven't dragged
you away from anybody.

920
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:54,614
My pleasure.

921
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:55,741
What can I do for you?

922
00:46:55,742 --> 00:46:57,409
Well you could let
me in if you would.

923
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,702
Well, in the club.

924
00:46:58,703 --> 00:46:59,704
Yes.

925
00:47:00,163 --> 00:47:01,621
It is not against the rules?

926
00:47:01,622 --> 00:47:02,999
I make the rules.

927
00:47:08,463 --> 00:47:09,546
Welcome back.

928
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:10,339
Thank you.

929
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,590
You do like it here.

930
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:12,549
Yes I did.

931
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,384
Am I allowed to sit here?

932
00:47:14,385 --> 00:47:15,886
I wouldn't want to
upset your hierarchy.

933
00:47:15,887 --> 00:47:17,597
I don't think you
would upset anything.

934
00:47:18,556 --> 00:47:19,557
Oh I might.

935
00:47:20,558 --> 00:47:22,602
Take it from me you're the
least upsetting person I've

936
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:23,727
met in my life.

937
00:47:23,728 --> 00:47:25,188
I suppose that
is a compliment.

938
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:27,690
It is.

939
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,112
You are actually old
enough to drink, huh?

940
00:47:33,696 --> 00:47:34,946
Everything is quite legal.

941
00:47:34,947 --> 00:47:35,948
Don't worry.

942
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:42,454
Well, where do we begin?

943
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:43,830
What do you suggest?

944
00:47:43,831 --> 00:47:44,915
Like to dance.

945
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:45,917
No.

946
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:47,459
Eat?

947
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,126
No.

948
00:47:48,127 --> 00:47:50,670
Well then, what
would you like to do?

949
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:52,464
Perhaps you
could take me home.

950
00:47:52,465 --> 00:47:54,217
What now, you just got here.

951
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:57,845
Well, if that's what you want.

952
00:47:59,389 --> 00:48:04,477
Almost...

953
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:14,487
What's the rush?

954
00:48:15,446 --> 00:48:17,364
You don't turn into
a pumpkin, do you?

955
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:19,282
Not if you take
me to your house,

956
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:20,284
otherwise I might.

957
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,417
Mind these steps I don't
think they've been cleaned for

958
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:28,834
months.

959
00:48:28,835 --> 00:48:33,840
Bloody cleaner, I don't
know why the door is open.

960
00:48:35,508 --> 00:48:36,509
All right.

961
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:41,055
Damn.

962
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:43,141
Someone must have
cut the lights off.

963
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:45,935
I'm only ever here in the day.

964
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:52,567
Be careful.

965
00:48:53,734 --> 00:48:54,944
I'll make some coffee.

966
00:48:56,988 --> 00:48:57,989
What?

967
00:49:00,158 --> 00:49:01,242
Electric kettle.

968
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:03,327
Never mind.

969
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,143
Do you want to go to bed?

970
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:33,107
Well, just like that?

971
00:49:34,734 --> 00:49:39,113
We reach the
stars Beyond the star,

972
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:50,610
almost To Jupiter,
yes To Venus and mars,

973
00:49:51,167 --> 00:50:00,036
yeah, almost I've won and lost
me a bet or two Making each

974
00:50:04,472 --> 00:50:13,341
lover routine Now do I
have a regret or two,

975
00:50:13,439 --> 00:50:22,308
almost Almost

976
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:06,117
Hey, sugar,
it's almost morning.

977
00:51:12,331 --> 00:51:13,958
Do you think
Fontaine is attractive?

978
00:51:17,962 --> 00:51:22,258
Put it this way, if I had two
choices you'd be both of them.

979
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,180
It's going to be
Christmas soon,

980
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:29,973
what are you doing?

981
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:32,392
I'm seeing mommy this weekend,
I'll probably stay there.

982
00:51:32,393 --> 00:51:33,727
Are you?

983
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:34,604
Where's that?

984
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:35,938
A cottage in the country.

985
00:51:38,941 --> 00:51:40,151
Would you like
to come with me?

986
00:51:40,901 --> 00:51:41,693
Mm-hmm.

987
00:51:41,694 --> 00:51:42,695
How's that?

988
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:47,033
I tell you how that
is, I think I love you.

989
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,285
I hope you would.

990
00:51:49,994 --> 00:51:50,995
Will you call me later?

991
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,748
What, in Paris?

992
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:56,459
What are you thinking?

993
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:59,711
Dye your eyes green, it might
suit you and I tell you what,

994
00:51:59,712 --> 00:52:01,171
dye your hair green
and change your shirt.

995
00:52:01,172 --> 00:52:03,173
What are you so
bleeding cheerful about?

996
00:52:03,174 --> 00:52:05,550
Its life man, its life.

997
00:52:05,551 --> 00:52:06,760
Oh knickers.

998
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:08,595
The lady goes away for
a couple of days you're

999
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:09,137
ecstatic.

1000
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:11,181
If she comes back you're
bleeding suicidal again.

1001
00:52:11,182 --> 00:52:12,432
I can handle it.

1002
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:13,892
Anyway this one is different.

1003
00:52:13,893 --> 00:52:14,934
What's different about it?

1004
00:52:14,935 --> 00:52:15,977
Hey, mind the pins will you.

1005
00:52:15,978 --> 00:52:17,395
It's like fucking acupuncture.

1006
00:52:17,396 --> 00:52:19,189
Which side do you dress sir?

1007
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,565
On the right,
I'm a south pole.

1008
00:52:20,566 --> 00:52:21,066
Thank you.

1009
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:22,776
It's not like that
with this one Sammy.

1010
00:52:22,777 --> 00:52:25,278
If I didn't know you better
I'd say cupid was up your

1011
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:26,279
arse, Antonio.

1012
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,323
I'd say love was
rearing it's ugly head,

1013
00:52:28,324 --> 00:52:31,117
my son, which for a bright
young lad your position is a

1014
00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:32,243
bleeding disaster.

1015
00:52:32,244 --> 00:52:33,036
Bullshit.

1016
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:34,954
Yeah, but delightfully served.

1017
00:52:34,955 --> 00:52:36,915
What's wrong with me 
being in love with her anyway?

1018
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:37,707
It does happen.

1019
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:40,085
Not with you and then
diamond studded hippos,

1020
00:52:40,086 --> 00:52:42,879
I know, but it does happen.

1021
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,256
Personally, I'm tired of
putting it in everything that

1022
00:52:45,257 --> 00:52:46,257
winks at me.

1023
00:52:46,258 --> 00:52:48,176
I don't care if I'm
in love with her.

1024
00:52:48,177 --> 00:52:49,886
I want to be in love with her.

1025
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:50,888
Wrong.

1026
00:52:55,685 --> 00:52:56,686
What you think, then?

1027
00:52:57,269 --> 00:52:59,729
Jacket looks fine,
you, you look fucked.

1028
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,272
Yeah, I was last night.

1029
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:03,274
Top it all, she nicked 15
quid of me while I was still

1030
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:03,525
kipping.

1031
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:04,818
You can't trust them, can you?

1032
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:06,487
I've been telling
you that for years.

1033
00:53:08,406 --> 00:53:09,989
Look at me and learn, babes.

1034
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,907
Yeah, look at you.

1035
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:12,076
The tie matches your eyes.

1036
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,077
That Khaled had been
coming a little bit

1037
00:53:14,078 --> 00:53:15,036
stronger last night with you?

1038
00:53:15,037 --> 00:53:16,496
Mind your own business.

1039
00:53:16,497 --> 00:53:18,707
What are you doing now
mother daughter act?

1040
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:19,999
What are you talking about?

1041
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,750
You haven't forgotten

1042
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:22,043
who your boss is, have you?

1043
00:53:22,044 --> 00:53:22,919
Fontaine.

1044
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,337
What she got to do with it?

1045
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:25,755
Oh, nothing sweetheart.

1046
00:53:25,756 --> 00:53:27,966
She's only the wife of
this fair damsel's father,

1047
00:53:27,967 --> 00:53:29,218
who you're screwing twice a week.

1048
00:53:30,302 --> 00:53:32,178
You are going to need a pair
of dark glasses and a white

1049
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:33,180
stick pretty soon.

1050
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:34,848
If you really want a broad?

1051
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:35,850
How about Mamie?

1052
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,476
At least she could
bank roll you, right?

1053
00:53:38,477 --> 00:53:42,981
Yeah, another Fontaine deal,
only this one's old and ugly.

1054
00:53:42,982 --> 00:53:44,858
"Hark at these
two, rent a pricks.

1055
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:48,194
Thanks for the offer Hal,
I've got other avenues.

1056
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:51,198
You got dead ends
baby, dead ends.

1057
00:54:04,336 --> 00:54:05,336
New York girl, ooh,
ooh, ooh Runnin pretty,

1058

heart and soul of New
York City And love,

1064
00:54:34,366 --> 00:54:41,873
love is just a passing word
It's the thought you had in a

1065
00:54:41,874 --> 00:54:50,006
taxi cab that got left on the
curb When he dropped you off

1066
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:54,761
and he stated
firm Oh, oh, oh (oh,

1067

oh, oh) You're a native New

1074
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:46,437
whoa, where did all those
yesterdays go When you still

1075
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:54,863
believed love could really be
like a Broadway show You are

1076
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:59,492
the star, win the
applause Oh, oh,

No one opens

1078
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:17,204
the door For a
native New Yorker

1079
00:56:50,336 --> 00:56:52,545
You're confirmed on the
10 o'clock flight to Orly.

1080
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:56,007
You'll be met, something
about opening a club in Paris.

1081
00:56:56,008 --> 00:56:57,051
Oh shit.

1082
00:57:14,526 --> 00:57:15,693
A bit early isn't it?

1083
00:57:15,694 --> 00:57:17,236
How're you keeping?

1084
00:57:17,237 --> 00:57:18,822
Well, very well.

1085
00:57:19,531 --> 00:57:22,867
Listen, I'm getting those
figures for you tomorrow.

1086
00:57:22,868 --> 00:57:23,952
Figures?

1087
00:57:23,953 --> 00:57:25,536
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:57:25,537 --> 00:57:27,747
It should be most revealing.

1089
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:29,958
So... make it a
gold mine this place.

1090
00:57:29,959 --> 00:57:32,877
Well, we'll call our
place the gold mine,

1091
00:57:32,878 --> 00:57:33,628
shall we?

1092
00:57:33,629 --> 00:57:36,923
All in good time
sweetheart, all in good time.

1093
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:39,425
I can start looking for
premises before Christmas.

1094
00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:42,095
All I need is your okay and
we'll start emptying this

1095
00:57:42,096 --> 00:57:44,263
place into our own pockets.

1096
00:57:44,264 --> 00:57:48,768
That's a very good idea
Tony, very good idea.

1097
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:51,021
Well, when?

1098
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:56,902
"Soon <i>as</i> I've had
a piss, partner.

1099
00:57:59,154 --> 00:58:02,699
Listen, I'm serious.

1100
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,619
Yeah, it's a very
serious business.

1101
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:09,372
Give me a call over Christmas.

1102
00:58:09,373 --> 00:58:12,750
We'll sort
something out, okay?

1103
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:13,752
Okay.

1104
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:20,926
Tell me, where does Fontaine
Khaled come into all this?

1105
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:27,683
Nowhere, it's just you and me.

1106
00:58:28,726 --> 00:58:34,023
Oh, it's a shame,
lovely lady, right?

1107
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:43,156
Paris?

1108
00:58:43,157 --> 00:58:44,949
Yeah, well what
else could I say?

1109
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:47,035
I'd be basking in Shit Street
for the New Year if I had say

1110
00:58:47,036 --> 00:58:48,453
no, wouldn't I?

1111
00:58:48,454 --> 00:58:50,872
If it had been the New Year, I
would've totally get run out,

1112
00:58:50,873 --> 00:58:51,289
wouldn't I?

1113
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:51,873
Why?

1114
00:58:51,874 --> 00:58:53,458
Santa Claus
bringing you a new job,

1115
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:54,417
is he?

1116
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:56,335
Well, don't screw his
reindeer when he does,

1117
00:58:56,336 --> 00:58:56,878
will you?

1118
00:58:56,879 --> 00:58:58,797
One of them might turn
out to be your boss.

1119
00:58:59,715 --> 00:59:02,425
Listen, you 40 year old teenager,

1120
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:04,886
I got Thane backing me in a
new club in a couple of weeks'

1121
00:59:04,887 --> 00:59:07,680
time and then I can
tell her it can run out.

1122
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:12,143
Give this to Thane and let
Franco have the books back,

1123
00:59:12,144 --> 00:59:13,145
all right.

1124
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,521
Yeah, sure.

1125
00:59:21,528 --> 00:59:22,653
You comfy back there.

1126
00:59:22,654 --> 00:59:23,696
It'll do.

1127
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:26,200
Here, take a couple of these.

1128
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,411
Keep your eyeballs open
even if your brain falls out.

1129
00:59:33,332 --> 00:59:34,540
What are they?

1130
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:38,378
Uppers, you know, keep
you on top of it all.

1131
00:59:40,422 --> 00:59:41,423
Paris.

1132
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:02,610
Welcome to Paris, Cheri.

1133
01:00:02,611 --> 01:00:03,612
Bon Jour.

1134
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:14,956
So, what have you been doing?

1135
01:00:14,957 --> 01:00:16,749
Anyone I should know about?

1136
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,838
Look, are you serious
about opening a club here?

1137
01:00:21,505 --> 01:00:22,922
Of course not.

1138
01:00:22,923 --> 01:00:24,967
That was just an
excuse to get you here.

1139
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:27,426
Well, I don't like being
summoned like piece of

1140
01:00:27,427 --> 01:00:28,678
luggage.

1141
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:29,680
Oh.

1142
01:00:35,227 --> 01:00:36,228
It's a nice coat.

1143
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:37,980
Is it new?

1144
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,730
This?

1145
01:00:39,731 --> 01:00:40,773
No.

1146
01:00:40,774 --> 01:00:42,067
I've had it for hours.

1147
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,735
Jeez.

1148
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:47,488
Oh lover you're
so predictable,

1149
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:50,075
never late and always shocked.

1150
01:00:52,244 --> 01:00:55,164
Look, I'm really
tired from the trip.

1151
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:59,709
But I bought this
especially for you.

1152
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:03,297
Anyway, you don't get
jet lagged flying from London.

1153
01:01:04,756 --> 01:01:07,259
This will wake you up.

1154
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,640
Oh lover we're going
to have a divine time.

1155
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:19,271
This is going to be
a night to remember.

1156
01:01:23,483 --> 01:01:26,819
Now you just relax and I
will do all of the work.

1157
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,906
I will show you
the French way.

1158
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:38,039
This house is the only
brilliant thing that Leonard

1159
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,290
ever created.

1160
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:42,251
He keeps on babbling on about
all those scripts that he

1161
01:01:42,252 --> 01:01:44,629
sends to Hollywood and
they all end up on the reject

1162
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:45,588
shelf.

1163
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:47,131
Amazing.

1164
01:01:47,132 --> 01:01:49,508
And he does it all
with Vanessa's money too.

1165
01:01:49,509 --> 01:01:50,510
Look at the parrot.

1166
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:52,803
Hello.

1167
01:01:52,804 --> 01:01:53,679
Bon Jour.

1168
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,807
Come on lover,
they're waiting for us.

1169
01:01:59,978 --> 01:02:03,731
Well darling, here he is and
in excellent working order.

1170
01:02:03,732 --> 01:02:05,274
Tony, welcome to the feast.

1171
01:02:05,275 --> 01:02:06,108
Hello Leonard.

1172
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:07,860
Come and sit down.

1173
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:08,444
Vanessa.

1174
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:10,279
This is Kamara
and this is Pierre.

1175
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,239
How you do?

1176
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,951
Kamara makes a fortune
painting by numbers and Pierre

1177
01:02:14,952 --> 01:02:16,035
helps them spend it.

1178
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:17,578
Well, that's one way
of making a living.

1179
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:19,288
What a remarkable young man.

1180
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:20,957
Where did you
find him, Fontaine?

1181
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:23,960
Inside a waiter's jacket and
trousers simply bursting to

1182
01:02:23,961 --> 01:02:24,919
explode.

1183
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,963
So, I let him out.

1184
01:02:26,964 --> 01:02:30,466
Such an oral
strength and the eyes.

1185
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:32,468
Put him down
Kamara, he's not yours.

1186
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:34,178
No, you don't know
where I've been either.

1187
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:35,930
I could, hazard a guess.

1188
01:02:35,931 --> 01:02:38,182
Then do if hazard
is the key to him.

1189
01:02:38,183 --> 01:02:40,142
I wouldn't say
hazard was the key,

1190
01:02:40,143 --> 01:02:41,227
Tony no.

1191
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:42,979
Perhaps you could
tell us who he is.

1192
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,730
Who needs a key?

1193
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:45,856
I picked the lock.

1194
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:50,152
And I, and to do this I'd
use either sex or money.

1195
01:02:50,153 --> 01:02:52,321
But suppose there are locks.

1196
01:02:52,322 --> 01:02:54,073
God Leonard not
philosophy, please.

1197
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:55,826
You'll turn the
evening into a fucking bore.

1198
01:02:56,368 --> 01:02:58,120
Well, I like the
things Leonard says.

1199
01:02:59,037 --> 01:03:00,329
Thank you, Tony.

1200
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,415
That makes you his
favorite listener,

1201
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:03,332
after himself.

1202
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:05,084
Oh, you English.

1203
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:08,754
You use your smiles as seals
and your words are swords.

1204
01:03:08,755 --> 01:03:10,548
Oh, how profound.

1205
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:12,341
Don't you wish you'd
said that Leonard?

1206
01:03:12,342 --> 01:03:14,469
I will.

1207
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:20,016
Well, I think I'll go and take
a look around and leave you to

1208
01:03:20,017 --> 01:03:20,976
solve your crossword puzzle.

1209
01:03:21,018 --> 01:03:23,853
Now don't go straying
too far, will you lover?

1210
01:03:23,854 --> 01:03:26,522
I shall go with him, to be
sure that he doesn't darling.

1211
01:03:26,523 --> 01:03:27,524
Good.

1212
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:30,944
Come Tony, let me show you
the palace of the light.

1213
01:03:34,114 --> 01:03:38,451
Don't worry about Kamara,
it's just another of Vanessa's

1214
01:03:38,452 --> 01:03:43,664
parasites, here,
drown your displeasure.

1215
01:03:43,665 --> 01:03:44,916
That's a very good idea.

1216
01:03:50,756 --> 01:03:51,757
Thank you.

1217
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:56,469
I often wonder what
it is the winters buy.

1218
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,889
One half so precious
as the goods they sell.

1219
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:03,393
Drugs, could it be?

1220
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:09,899
Well, you're not doing
too badly as a writer.

1221
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,650
I wish I learned to
spell a bit better.

1222
01:04:11,651 --> 01:04:13,070
This is not good spelling.

1223
01:04:14,529 --> 01:04:17,615
This is a truce of
a cunning marriage.

1224
01:04:17,616 --> 01:04:21,786
I needed someone to support
me in my craft and seminar.

1225
01:04:21,787 --> 01:04:23,747
Vanessa needed
someone to support.

1226
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:28,042
In some ways I'm more of a
tax loss than a husband.

1227
01:04:28,043 --> 01:04:29,669
You're not complaining
though, are you?

1228
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:35,508
Come and see my
little paddling pool.

1229
01:04:35,509 --> 01:04:37,469
But mind the deep end.

1230
01:04:41,848 --> 01:04:43,224
Who are they Leonard?

1231
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:46,520
I don't know but... they
are nearly always here.

1232
01:04:49,022 --> 01:04:51,148
Women bore me Tony.

1233
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:52,024
Do they?

1234
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:55,361
Much as I appreciate
an additional orifice,

1235
01:04:55,362 --> 01:04:56,488
they bore me.

1236
01:04:57,989 --> 01:05:02,411
Hey Tony, Tony hold
on, let's go for a swim.

1237
01:05:04,454 --> 01:05:06,747
Not just now, what
about the others?

1238
01:05:06,748 --> 01:05:09,876
Oh don't worry about them
they'll be long in a moment,

1239
01:05:13,922 --> 01:05:14,923
here.

1240
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:25,767
I thought they'd never leave.

1241
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:28,018
Where do you
find them, Vanessa?

1242
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:29,020
Here...

1243
01:05:39,865 --> 01:05:41,408
So when do I get
it all together?

1244
01:05:42,659 --> 01:05:46,203
All we have to do is to
press, button number one.

1245
01:05:46,204 --> 01:05:49,832
And which button
would that be?

1246
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:53,085
Well, darling all of
Tony's zones are erogenous.

1247
01:05:53,086 --> 01:05:57,089
You can choose anyone of
them and they are all good.

1248
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,301
Vanessa, get here...

1249
01:06:03,013 --> 01:06:04,221
Come on Jess.

1250
01:06:04,222 --> 01:06:05,515
Coming.

1251
01:06:35,253 --> 01:06:37,255
Tony, I have got a
surprise for you.

1252
01:06:40,008 --> 01:06:41,218
Get in there.

1253
01:06:42,177 --> 01:06:43,428
He's wrapping up.

1254
01:06:44,638 --> 01:06:45,846
You're my Christmas present.

1255
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:48,724
Don't you want to
see what's inside it?

1256
01:06:48,725 --> 01:06:55,815
Come on, come on, no come on.

1257
01:06:58,485 --> 01:06:59,945
I'm going to have you.

1258
01:07:00,737 --> 01:07:03,698
Oh Leonard, where
you've been all my life?

1259
01:07:09,746 --> 01:07:11,372
Take me, love it.

1260
01:07:11,373 --> 01:07:15,000
Ready?

1261
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:23,870
Do it.

1262
01:08:51,598 --> 01:08:54,225
Tony, Tony, Tony don't go.

1263
01:08:59,314 --> 01:09:02,067
Tony, come on back.

1264
01:10:06,339 --> 01:10:08,173
What's going on?

1265
01:10:08,174 --> 01:10:09,634
It's an emergency.

1266
01:10:13,054 --> 01:10:14,055
Stop it.

1267
01:10:16,349 --> 01:10:17,892
Your cue.

1268
01:10:32,615 --> 01:10:34,241
That's enough darling.

1269
01:10:34,242 --> 01:10:35,743
Where's your husband then?

1270
01:10:35,744 --> 01:10:37,036
He's in Geneva.

1271
01:10:38,246 --> 01:10:40,080
What's he doing there?

1272
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:41,583
He's meeting his daughter.

1273
01:10:44,586 --> 01:10:47,004
I'm supposed to be
working in his club.

1274
01:10:47,005 --> 01:10:48,338
It's my club.

1275
01:10:48,339 --> 01:10:52,134
"I can take a loss for an
hour and you're supposed to be

1276
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:53,928
looking after me.

1277
01:11:07,484 --> 01:11:08,485
Ricardo residence.

1278
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:13,280
Ricardo, wake him
if you have to.

1279
01:11:13,281 --> 01:11:14,824
It is in the middle
of the night, Sir.

1280
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:17,826
Benjamin Khaled here.

1281
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:21,872
Well Mr. Khaled, I'm sorry
Mr. Ricardo is not here,

1282
01:11:21,873 --> 01:11:22,790
he won't be back until...

1283
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:25,210
I want him in my office
tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.

1284
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:30,632
9 o'clock.

1285
01:11:38,556 --> 01:11:39,557
Bon Jour.

1286
01:11:42,685 --> 01:11:45,355
Oh my God, what a dump.

1287
01:11:49,317 --> 01:11:51,068
Did I wake you?

1288
01:11:51,069 --> 01:11:52,070
Yeah.

1289
01:11:53,321 --> 01:11:55,447
Wasn't last night fun?

1290
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:57,492
All that fun, you can keep it.

1291
01:11:58,576 --> 01:12:00,661
Nobody had a gun to
your head my pet.

1292
01:12:00,662 --> 01:12:01,328
You know what I mean.

1293
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:03,664
I don't like being
put in that position.

1294
01:12:03,665 --> 01:12:05,457
And which position was that?

1295
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,251
You were in so many.

1296
01:12:07,252 --> 01:12:09,671
I'm talking about those
nutters you call friends.

1297
01:12:10,755 --> 01:12:12,422
I hope you're not
reverting to type,

1298
01:12:12,423 --> 01:12:13,173
Tony.

1299
01:12:13,174 --> 01:12:16,260
I thought I've trained all of
that working class taboo out

1300
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:16,969
of you.

1301
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:21,224
Well, you haven't.

1302
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,101
So it appears.

1303
01:12:24,102 --> 01:12:27,729
Vanessa was disappointed in
your performance too or rather

1304
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:30,357
than the lack of it,
especially after the rave

1305
01:12:30,358 --> 01:12:31,775
reviews I gave you.

1306
01:12:31,776 --> 01:12:34,279
You mean you already had
that lot worked out between.

1307
01:12:37,657 --> 01:12:41,410
You cow, don't you
ever do that to me again,

1308
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:42,412
ever.

1309
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,414
I wouldn't dream of it.

1310
01:12:45,415 --> 01:12:47,249
As a matter of fact, I
think it's time that I started

1311
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:50,586
looking for something
a bit more up market.

1312
01:12:50,587 --> 01:12:52,087
All right, all
right so I'm dismissed,

1313
01:12:52,088 --> 01:12:53,172
how do I get back home?

1314
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,717
Fuck yourself there darling.

1315
01:12:56,718 --> 01:13:05,587
You could do with
a little practice.

1316
01:14:41,864 --> 01:14:43,116
Holy shit.

1317
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:54,292
Ah, you must be Tony.

1318
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:55,794
Yes, Mrs. Khaled, 
right?

1319
01:14:55,795 --> 01:14:57,504
Ah yes.

1320
01:14:57,505 --> 01:14:59,089
But do come along.

1321
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,925
Alex said you'd be arriving
but I'm afraid she's out for

1322
01:15:01,926 --> 01:15:02,927
the moment.

1323
01:15:04,137 --> 01:15:05,930
Nice little
place you got here.

1324
01:15:07,932 --> 01:15:10,642
Yes, well, we like it.

1325
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:12,686
Now, Staton will show
you to a room and then,

1326
01:15:12,687 --> 01:15:14,062
perhaps you'd like a drink.

1327
01:15:14,063 --> 01:15:15,732
Fine, yeah, fine.

1328
01:15:31,831 --> 01:15:32,581
Who's that?

1329
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:35,250
Tony Blake.

1330
01:15:35,251 --> 01:15:37,127
Your gin and tonic madam.

1331
01:15:37,128 --> 01:15:38,295
Thank you.

1332
01:15:38,296 --> 01:15:39,755
Scotch and soda sir.

1333
01:15:39,756 --> 01:15:40,757
Oh yeah, thank you.

1334
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:43,551
Quite up here...

1335
01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:45,844
Would you like a drink sir?

1336
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:47,179
Yeah, whiskey and coke please.

1337
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:48,055
Coke sir?

1338
01:15:48,056 --> 01:15:49,181
Yes, cola.

1339
01:15:49,182 --> 01:15:51,308
That's a strange
drink young man.

1340
01:15:51,309 --> 01:15:52,726
With the whiskey sir?

1341
01:15:52,727 --> 01:15:54,895
Yes, I know its awful
shame to waste perfectly good

1342
01:15:54,896 --> 01:15:55,979
Coca-Cola.

1343
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,899
Yes, quite certain.

1344
01:16:04,197 --> 01:16:06,698
Well, as I was saying, I'm
just down the road next to

1345
01:16:06,699 --> 01:16:07,574
Mrs. Haley Scott.

1346
01:16:07,575 --> 01:16:08,450
Do you know her?

1347
01:16:08,451 --> 01:16:09,534
No, don't know her.

1348
01:16:09,535 --> 01:16:12,454
Yes, well, her husband
died about three years ago.

1349
01:16:12,455 --> 01:16:14,039
They used to keep race horses.

1350
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,249
Comme un cheval.

1351
01:16:30,056 --> 01:16:31,057
Thanks darling.

1352
01:16:31,766 --> 01:16:32,767
Oh well.

1353
01:16:34,936 --> 01:16:36,686
Very nice, did you
make them yourself,

1354
01:16:36,687 --> 01:16:37,688
don't you?

1355
01:16:38,314 --> 01:16:39,315
Sit there.

1356
01:16:44,403 --> 01:16:45,404
Next to you.

1357
01:16:54,247 --> 01:16:54,746
Thank to you.

1358
01:16:54,747 --> 01:16:55,957
That's right.

1359
01:17:07,343 --> 01:17:08,386
What are you doing here?

1360
01:17:13,349 --> 01:17:14,350
No, not here.

1361
01:17:16,477 --> 01:17:18,938
Okay, we'll just talk.

1362
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,481
Not now.

1363
01:17:21,732 --> 01:17:23,525
What's going on Alex?

1364
01:17:23,526 --> 01:17:24,442
Going on?

1365
01:17:24,443 --> 01:17:25,862
I can't get near you.

1366
01:17:27,655 --> 01:17:28,530
Really, I...

1367
01:17:28,531 --> 01:17:31,241
Look, I came here for you
and not this country bullshit,

1368
01:17:31,242 --> 01:17:32,243
you understand.

1369
01:17:41,335 --> 01:17:43,253
Christ, Alex, I'm sorry.

1370
01:17:43,254 --> 01:17:45,338
I just never felt like
this about a chick before and

1371
01:17:45,339 --> 01:17:46,006
that's all.

1372
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:47,382
A chick?

1373
01:17:47,383 --> 01:17:48,842
Get out of my room.

1374
01:17:48,843 --> 01:17:51,511
Get back in your nasty little
car and take your stupid words

1375
01:17:51,512 --> 01:17:52,679
back where you belong.

1376
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,763
Go on, get out.

1377
01:17:53,764 --> 01:17:55,433
For Christ Alex,
what did I do?

1378
01:17:55,474 --> 01:17:56,434
What did you do?

1379
01:17:56,475 --> 01:17:58,727
You think I don't know about
you and that cheap slut who

1380
01:17:58,728 --> 01:17:59,603
owns you.

1381
01:17:59,604 --> 01:18:01,229
You think you can break my
father's heart between the

1382
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:03,523
rotten pair of you and expect
me to love you on a one night

1383
01:18:03,524 --> 01:18:04,525
stand?

1384
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:08,445
Listen Alex, Fontaine,
she's nothing to me.

1385
01:18:08,446 --> 01:18:09,404
Go and tell her then.

1386
01:18:09,405 --> 01:18:10,447
Go and tell the bitch.

1387
01:18:10,448 --> 01:18:12,575
Tell her I sent you back
again as a Christmas present.

1388
01:18:16,162 --> 01:18:17,871
You're just about
what she deserves.

1389
01:18:17,872 --> 01:18:19,915
A cheap gigolo in a
little night club,

1390
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:21,751
a visit when she
feels like it.

1391
01:18:23,044 --> 01:18:24,920
Go on, get out.

1392
01:18:24,921 --> 01:18:27,381
Get back to your chicks
and your stupid friends.

1393
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:30,175
You're pathetic.

1394
01:18:30,176 --> 01:18:33,053
Did you think I'd fall for
the irresistible Tony like the

1395
01:18:33,054 --> 01:18:34,054
rest of them?

1396
01:18:34,055 --> 01:18:35,222
Is that what you thought?

1397
01:18:35,223 --> 01:18:36,224
Is it?

1398
01:19:14,161 --> 01:19:15,162
Come on.

1399
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:51,865
I'm home.

1400
01:19:53,283 --> 01:19:54,326
Where's everybody?

1401
01:19:56,161 --> 01:19:57,286
Who are you?

1402
01:19:57,287 --> 01:19:58,288
Where's my husband?

1403
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:01,249
Who the hell are you?

1404
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,501
My name is Rupert
Scott, Mrs. Khaled.

1405
01:20:03,502 --> 01:20:06,546
I work for your
husband in a legal capacity.

1406
01:20:06,547 --> 01:20:08,006
He asked me to give you this.

1407
01:20:11,635 --> 01:20:13,845
Your husband has instructed me
to inform you that he's taking

1408
01:20:13,846 --> 01:20:16,013
divorce proceedings against
you at the earliest possible

1409
01:20:16,014 --> 01:20:17,515
opportunity in the New Year.

1410
01:20:17,516 --> 01:20:19,726
Also that your clothes and
effects have been removed from

1411
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:22,186
this property and placed for
your convenience in a suite at

1412
01:20:22,187 --> 01:20:25,815
the Connel hotel all
reasonable care was taken.

1413
01:20:25,816 --> 01:20:27,442
Further that as
from midnight tonight,

1414
01:20:27,443 --> 01:20:29,777
this property reverts to the
holding company and all the

1415
01:20:29,778 --> 01:20:32,113
keys and locks will
therefore be changed.

1416
01:20:32,114 --> 01:20:35,199
A notice has also been
promulgated to the effect that

1417
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,785
your husband is no longer
responsible for any debts

1418
01:20:37,786 --> 01:20:39,288
incurred by you in his name.

1419
01:20:40,372 --> 01:20:41,707
My God.

1420
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:46,794
Is there anything
you'd, you'd wish to ask me,

1421
01:20:46,795 --> 01:20:47,796
Mrs. Khaled?

1422
01:20:49,047 --> 01:20:53,050
You, no.

1423
01:20:53,051 --> 01:20:54,719
Very well then.

1424
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,971
I'll bid you goodnight.

1425
01:20:59,725 --> 01:21:02,268
Oh, by the way
Merry Christmas,

1426
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:03,353
Mrs. Khaled.

1427
01:21:49,274 --> 01:21:51,359
Mr. Thane is not
in at the moment.

1428
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,947
If you wish to leave a message
please speak after the tone.

1429
01:21:57,449 --> 01:21:58,783
Merry Christmas here my lad.

1430
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,285
Its Tony Blake here, sorry
I couldn't get you before

1431
01:22:01,286 --> 01:22:02,745
Christmas but you
know how it is.

1432
01:22:02,746 --> 01:22:04,622
Give us a call will
you, you got the numbers.

1433
01:22:04,623 --> 01:22:06,792
Don't forget about
our little deal.

1434
01:22:12,923 --> 01:22:21,472
Hark the herald angels
sing Glory to the newborn King

1435
01:22:21,473 --> 01:22:30,190
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

1436
01:22:32,025 --> 01:22:33,776
Hello.

1437
01:22:33,777 --> 01:22:34,527
Yes?

1438
01:22:34,528 --> 01:22:38,364
It's, its Tony Blake
here, Mrs. Khaled?

1439
01:22:38,365 --> 01:22:39,532
Yes, it's I.

1440
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:41,492
Yes, we did meet briefly.

1441
01:22:41,493 --> 01:22:42,494
That's right.

1442
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:46,163
I was wondering if I
could speak to Alexandra,

1443
01:22:46,164 --> 01:22:47,164
please.

1444
01:22:47,165 --> 01:22:48,916
Well, I'm afraid
she's out at the moment,

1445
01:22:48,917 --> 01:22:50,084
Tony.

1446
01:22:50,085 --> 01:22:51,211
Can I get her to ring you?

1447
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:54,380
Yes please.

1448
01:22:54,381 --> 01:22:56,674
Does she know your number.

1449
01:22:56,675 --> 01:22:57,676
Yes.

1450
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:03,055
Well, goodbye then.

1451
01:23:03,056 --> 01:23:04,391
Bye-bye and Merry Christmas.

1452
01:23:05,726 --> 01:23:06,727
Merry Christmas.

1453
01:23:13,358 --> 01:23:14,525
What was that?

1454
01:23:14,526 --> 01:23:16,110
Oh, it is nothing important.

1455
01:23:16,111 --> 01:23:19,614
Friends, this is one
of the happiest moments

1456
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:20,573
of my life.

1457
01:23:20,574 --> 01:23:22,576
I propose a toast to
my daughter, Alex.

1458
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:25,621
2p, love.

1459
01:23:37,424 --> 01:23:38,425
Goodbye darling.

1460
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,741
Mr. Thane is not in.

1461
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:29,977
Sammy Marks.

1462
01:24:31,645 --> 01:24:38,234
Hello, Sammy, it's Tony.

1463
01:24:38,235 --> 01:24:39,360
How are you?

1464
01:24:39,361 --> 01:24:40,820
I heard you were dead and
doing the club circuit up

1465
01:24:40,821 --> 01:24:41,988
north is that true?

1466
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:43,990
No, that's an ugly rumor.

1467
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:47,243
I'm alive and well,
living in South America.

1468
01:24:47,244 --> 01:24:48,411
Pick the right
time of year for it,

1469
01:24:48,412 --> 01:24:49,787
didn't you?

1470
01:24:49,788 --> 01:24:51,038
What are you doing down here?

1471
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:52,749
Well, Christmas
with my mom and dad,

1472
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:55,084
who may or may not be alive,
you can't tell till you switch

1473
01:24:55,085 --> 01:24:56,837
the box off, then
you hear them snoring.

1474
01:24:58,839 --> 01:25:01,382
Well, I was supposed to be
tucked up with Alex but...

1475
01:25:01,383 --> 01:25:02,508
I don't know.

1476
01:25:02,509 --> 01:25:04,093
Not that mother
and daughter act.

1477
01:25:04,094 --> 01:25:05,095
No way.

1478
01:25:05,971 --> 01:25:08,472
I had enough with that
lunatic woman in Paris.

1479
01:25:08,473 --> 01:25:09,724
Did she have enough of you?

1480
01:25:09,725 --> 01:25:12,269
Yeah, her and her mate.

1481
01:25:14,062 --> 01:25:18,024
I got to get out of that one
Sammy and I thought if I could

1482
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:19,151
just talk to Alex.

1483
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:23,988
You are thick my
old fruit ain't you.

1484
01:25:23,989 --> 01:25:26,866
I mean, I love you
but you are thick.

1485
01:25:26,867 --> 01:25:27,867
Thanks.

1486
01:25:27,868 --> 01:25:31,203
Listen my son, there's two
sorts of ladies in this world.

1487
01:25:31,204 --> 01:25:33,457
The first sort will
pick you up and screw you,

1488
01:25:33,498 --> 01:25:35,750
second sort will pick your
brains and screw you up.

1489
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:37,960
Your Alex belongs to the
latter half as far as you're

1490
01:25:37,961 --> 01:25:38,878
concerned.

1491
01:25:38,879 --> 01:25:40,796
You're not from the
same planet you two,

1492
01:25:40,797 --> 01:25:43,382
I mean, she might fancy
you or she might not.

1493
01:25:43,383 --> 01:25:46,135
When it comes to any
kind of permanent fixture,

1494
01:25:46,136 --> 01:25:48,637
you've got all your assets and
eligibility of a piece of very

1495
01:25:48,638 --> 01:25:49,639
rough trade.

1496
01:25:50,724 --> 01:25:52,142
I'm not hurting
your feelings, am I?

1497
01:25:53,393 --> 01:25:55,062
I don't believe you, Sammy.

1498
01:25:56,605 --> 01:25:59,356
All right, so my name is not
hopely stopley and I didn't

1499
01:25:59,357 --> 01:26:01,817
make head boy at Gordonstoun
but I can still handle myself

1500
01:26:01,818 --> 01:26:05,071
can't I, but if I couldn't
that club wouldn't be nothing

1501
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:07,656
without me for a start and
it's not going to end there

1502
01:26:07,657 --> 01:26:09,076
either, not by a long way.

1503
01:26:10,285 --> 01:26:12,578
They're going to be eating off
of my tables for very shortly,

1504
01:26:12,579 --> 01:26:13,245
you'll see.

1505
01:26:13,246 --> 01:26:15,247
Oh yeah, yes.

1506
01:26:15,248 --> 01:26:16,707
Yes, if Thane came through.

1507
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:18,084
Yeah, firm?

1508
01:26:18,085 --> 01:26:19,919
The contract has been drawn.

1509
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,462
Oh, not firm.

1510
01:26:21,463 --> 01:26:23,964
A verbal agreement worth
exactly the paper it's

1511
01:26:23,965 --> 01:26:24,799
written on.

1512
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,094
Listen Tony, with a
schmuck like Thane,

1513
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:30,471
you don't believe till the
money is in the bank and then

1514
01:26:30,472 --> 01:26:32,389
checked by experts to make
sure the Queen's picture ain't

1515
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:34,266
winking at you.

1516
01:26:34,267 --> 01:26:35,935
Thane is the
serpent in the garden,

1517
01:26:35,936 --> 01:26:36,937
my son.

1518
01:26:37,145 --> 01:26:37,978
I'm not worried.

1519
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:42,024
Yeah, that's what
I like about you.

1520
01:26:42,025 --> 01:26:44,652
Come on, let me buy you a
drink for the New Year,

1521
01:26:44,653 --> 01:26:46,070
you're going to need it.

1522
01:26:46,071 --> 01:26:48,406
You don't often meet a
winner who loses like you.

1523
01:27:29,573 --> 01:27:35,328
Let's go disco Let's go disco

1524
01:28:27,422 --> 01:28:28,714
Having fun, Tony?

1525
01:28:28,715 --> 01:28:30,132
Don't know whether you know
but Alex and I are engaged,

1526
01:28:30,133 --> 01:28:31,634
getting married in
the spring probably.

1527
01:28:31,635 --> 01:28:32,801
Don't you think
it is a good idea,

1528
01:28:32,802 --> 01:28:34,595
but we thought we'd hold
our engagement party here?

1529
01:28:34,596 --> 01:28:36,555
Yes, I know it's a bit
of a delicate subject,

1530
01:28:36,556 --> 01:28:37,557
see you later old chap.

1531
01:28:39,226 --> 01:28:41,310
Excuse me, excuse me.

1532
01:28:41,311 --> 01:28:42,646
Have you seen Madeline?

1533
01:28:44,731 --> 01:28:45,732
Are you all right?

1534
01:28:47,984 --> 01:28:49,693
Here, where you
been all my life?

1535
01:28:49,694 --> 01:28:51,946
I tell you what,
play your cards right,

1536
01:28:51,947 --> 01:28:53,323
you could have me tonight.

1537
01:28:54,407 --> 01:28:56,660
Ooh amazing lips, amazing.

1538
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:09,588
Let's go disco Let's go disco

1539
01:29:09,589 --> 01:29:18,055
The night is
still young Let the DJ play

1540
01:29:18,056 --> 01:29:21,725
your song Let's go disco

1541
01:29:21,726 --> 01:29:23,061
Tony, give us a kiss.

1542
01:29:31,736 --> 01:29:35,114
Tony, you're
looking very well.

1543
01:29:35,115 --> 01:29:36,741
You know Ian of course.

1544
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:38,743
We've met.

1545
01:29:40,453 --> 01:29:43,540
Perhaps next time
you'll be a little wiser.

1546
01:29:43,581 --> 01:29:45,874
As a matter of fact, you
saved me some problems.

1547
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:49,670
Ben wants to sell and Ian
has offered to buy his share.

1548
01:29:49,671 --> 01:29:52,464
Since you're going to go
into business for yourself,

1549
01:29:52,465 --> 01:29:57,012
all I need to do is to find a
new manager for this place and

1550
01:30:00,807 --> 01:30:02,641
don't be here
tomorrow will you, Tony?

1551
01:30:02,642 --> 01:30:04,060
There's a good boy.

1552
01:30:45,477 --> 01:30:46,895
Is life beautiful man.

1553
01:30:49,064 --> 01:30:50,440
Ain't it beautiful?

1554
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:10,168
Five minutes everybody.

1555
01:31:15,006 --> 01:31:17,217
Hello Charlie, how are you?

1556
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:26,850
You bastard, you
cock sucking bastard.

1557
01:31:26,851 --> 01:31:29,520
You and that whore stab me
in the fucking back with your

1558
01:31:29,521 --> 01:31:30,521
bloody night club punks.

1559
01:31:30,522 --> 01:31:32,606
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm
fucking finished with you and

1560
01:31:32,607 --> 01:31:34,233
this bloody dump...

1561
01:31:34,234 --> 01:31:35,568
You are a filthy runt.

1562
01:31:39,656 --> 01:31:40,657
Here we go.

1563
01:31:48,832 --> 01:31:49,916
Get him out of here.

1564
01:31:52,419 --> 01:31:53,503
Come on you.

1565
01:32:00,176 --> 01:32:01,177
Get up.

1566
01:32:03,596 --> 01:32:04,597
Tony.

1567
01:32:06,975 --> 01:32:07,976
Tony.

1568
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,561
Come here.

1569
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,663
Give us a call
champ,

1570
01:32:30,748 --> 01:32:31,749
anytime.

1571
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:39,465
Nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three

1572
01:32:39,466 --> 01:32:41,467
Mr. Blake, Mr. Blake.

1573
01:32:41,468 --> 01:32:50,337
Two, one, Happy New Year.
