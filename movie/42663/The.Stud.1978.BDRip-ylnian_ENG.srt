00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:41,965
Hello.

2
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,235
Mr. Blake, please.

3
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:44,737
Blake?

4
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:48,449
I don't think there's
mister ...there's Tony?

5
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:50,076
Here.

6
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:56,791
Mr. Blake, we booked in 103.

7
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,335
Who?

8
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,919
I've got to go.

9
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,796
It's about six.

10
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:02,630
No way.

11
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:03,798
No more than four.

12
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,258
Jesus Christ, don't bother
me with this kind of crap,

13
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,260
okay.

14
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,056
No bVe-byes?

15
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,433
No, no bye-byes.

16
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:14,892
Can I call you sometime?

17
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:15,977
Any time.

18
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,437
What's your name?

19
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:19,439
Felicity.

20
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,657
Back to your boyfriend,
Felicity darling.

21
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:57,310
What's his name,
what's his name?

22
00:03:58,978 --> 00:03:59,979
The stud

23
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:32,303
He's the stud,

24
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:36,057
stud

25
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,477
What's his game,

26
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:40,645
what's his game?

27
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:43,314
Stud

28
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:19,559
Stud

29
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:23,479
Hello my pretty.

30
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,188
And I have to start, boy,
who plays the brake down.

31
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,606
But I'm moving, even
if I have to push it.

32
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,609
But I nearly started to
write that ticket for you.

33
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:30,695
Oh, just try and
see if it works.

34
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,034
It works.

35
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:00,516
He is the stud...

36
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:05,063
Stud...

37
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,734
What's his game,
what's his game?

38
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:12,612
Stud...

39
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:25,083
Oh Charlie.
And I'd tell you wildly.

40
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,106
Come on, come on, let's have it.

41
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,525
The little punters
are on their way.

42
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:51,943
A very good set.

43
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,200
This is it.

44
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:00,535
Mr. Blake is very early.

45
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:01,953
What's the time again?

46
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:08,751
That little guy,
what's his name?

47
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:09,544
Lukeno.

48
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,337
Yeah, give him a jacket
tonight, all right'?

49
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,380
Okay.

50
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,176
Mr. Blake, this came
for you yesterday.

51
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:24,725
Hey Claus, how is it going?

52
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:25,935
Top of the tree, man.

53
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,687
I'm going to whoop
their ass tonight.

54
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:30,982
Mr. Blake, there's a phone
call for you, Mrs. Khaled.

55
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:36,487
Yes, Mrs. Khaled?

56
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:38,489
You're never late
are you, lover.

57
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:41,701
The car is waiting for you.

58
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:43,744
So am I.

59
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:45,079
Put your coat on.

60
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,581
I don't want you
catching a cold.

61
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:50,667
Franco, reservations.

62
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:51,794
Yeah.

63
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,087
Miss Carla Casini,
she is coming tonight?

64
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:56,798
You put the wolves on a second
to best table last night,

65
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,675
my baby.

66
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,759
Never mind the backhanders
you put them back in oblivion

67
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,678
where they belong, all right?

68
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,679
Yes, Mr. Blake.

69
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:05,307
Yes, who is it?

70
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:06,225
Your mother, Mr. Blake.

71
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:08,269
All right, put her through.
Franco,

72
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:13,232
you've got Mike Rovani on the bad
side there explain that to me.

73
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,192
Yes, you put them in with the silk shirt

74
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,110
and the colors around

75
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:20,322
it may dye it pink a bit, my
handkerchiefs are a bit red.

76
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:22,324
Mr. Blake, he bounced
three checks last week.

77
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:23,742
He's not exactly
a good costumer.

78
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,660
Look, you know
who his old man is?

79
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:27,496
If he likes a client,
a couple of checks,

80
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:28,623
you let him, all right'?

81
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,126
So put him on the
good side, all right?

82
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:33,169
Well Tony, all right.

83
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,003
Yes mom.

84
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,755
Christmas, what about it?

85
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:38,548
All right.

86
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,966
I'll try and make it.

87
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:40,676
I'll let you know.

88
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:41,885
All right.

89
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:42,887
Ta-ta.

90
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:44,847
Franco.
Si.

91
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,766
I've just got to
pop out for an hour.

92
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,560
Keep the mafia
more busy, will you?

93
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:50,079
Don't drop it, will you, lover?

94
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:51,455
It's 5th Century.

95
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:53,957
You're wondering how
much it was worth,

96
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,959
weren't you?

97
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,377
It's not hard to
imagine what your thinking,

98
00:09:57,378 --> 00:09:58,754
most of the time.

99
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:01,089
Well, I was thinking about
the weather now and again,

100
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,550
and I think about you
and what you're thinking.

101
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:06,012
Let's go and
discuss the weather then.

102
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:22,652
What's going on?

103
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:24,447
It's an emergency.

104
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,117
What's that?

105
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:30,745
That's your cue.

106
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,131
That's enough.

107
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:44,091
Oh, that's enough, Tony.

108
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:45,926
That's enough darling.

109
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:47,970
Come on.

110
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:51,599
Where's your husband then?

111
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,225
In Geneva.

112
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:55,102
What's he doing there?

113
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:56,395
Meeting his daughter.

114
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,191
Well I'm supposed to
be working in his club.

115
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:03,694
It's my club and I can
take a loss for an hour.

116
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,155
You're supposed to
be looking at me.

117
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,661
That's right.

118
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:46,195
Was nice.

119
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:51,492

Okay.

169
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,285
Blake,

170
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:24,329
Mrs. Weinstein.
That's all right.

171
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,415
Franco, please tell Mr.
Blake Lord Newton is here.

172
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:31,420
Tony, it's a
privilege to see you.

173
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:34,422
I haven't got a reservation
but one doesn't go in the

174
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,341
afternoon but one's
going to go in the evening.

175
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:39,637
Molly darling, you
look like a dynamite.

176
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,679
I take it your unescorted.

177
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,681
What? No, no... I've got two
charming twins with me,

178
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:44,600
Nigel and Jeremy.

179
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,852
I suppose you know the rules
single gentlemen pull

180
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:48,354
the ladies in.

181
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:49,146
How are you?

182
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:50,355
Fine, fine.

183
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,065
Got a table for me and the lad?

184
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:52,858
Absolutely.

185
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,692
Franco, table for Mr. Flynne.

186
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:56,111
Thanks, Tony.

187
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:58,029
Single gentlemen
pull the ladies,

188
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,614
it makes the other
gentlemen uptight.

189
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:01,240
Well, I never
pulled a lady in my life.

190
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:02,533
That's a bloody silly rule.

191
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:03,868
I don't make the rules.

192
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:05,578
Oh, nice to see you surely.

193
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,080
You can always
make an exception for a very

194
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,790
special pal, don't you?

195
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,750
Look, everyone here is special.

196
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,835
Well, what if I
should jolly well decide to

197
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:14,087
cancel my membership then?

198
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:16,089
Well if that's how you feel.

199
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,758
No, no, no, no it's
only a joke, Tony.

200
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,468
Anytime, let me know.

201
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:21,178
Yes.

202
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,929
You'll know where we are
going when you're not so busy.

203
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,097
We'll go somewhere else.

204
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:26,683
Come along child,
we'll go down the road.

205
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:28,352
You love it, don't you?

206
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,395
Well, I deal
perks with like that.

207
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:31,479
I used to run my ass up for
them and they leave me for

208
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,022
money for a tip.

209
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,440
Waiter never forgets, eh.

210
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:35,067
How are you going?

211
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,860
Uh sneaking by.

212
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:39,071
Hello darling.

213
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:40,072
Good morning?

214
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:42,741
Hello, sweetheart.

215
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:43,909
Hi darling.

216
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:46,870
Hello sweetheart.

217
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,330
Jesus, you'd be sneaking by
the child offenses act

218
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:51,791
if they get me...
How are you doing?

219
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,334
Where did you find them?

220
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:54,211
There's nothing to it.

221
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,212
I just follow the school bus,
ran in a roll and wait till

222
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:58,674
they climb in, and they do.

223
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:01,926
You rob the cradle,
Hal robs the graveyard,

224
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:02,803
what a pair.

225
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,137
You don't have to twist
their arm these days,

226
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:05,097
you know?

227
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:07,640
Can't hop down on the old
foggy before he complains.

228
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:09,642
I'll blame the lad on the
moral standards on the TV

229
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,311
and so do you'?

230
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:13,229
Well, I'll blame it on
gray head women like you.

231
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,481
They ask for comics, not a bag
of sweet and you give them a

232
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:16,649
penthouse to have on my trade.

233
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,859
You're only young
once, you know.

234
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,946
That's what their
dad's keep tellin them.

235
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,866
Franco, get Mr. Marc's a
scotch and a milk shake for

236
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:25,659
his daughter.

237
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,743
I left my wallet in
my other suit, right?

238
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,995
Boy, doesn't matter honey.
A buddy of mine runs the club.

239
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:31,123
Hey Tony, meet Maxine.
She runs Springs.

240
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:32,832
Oh, this is a nice place.

241
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,710
She is loaded.

242
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:35,544
What'?

243
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:36,170
Nothing.

244
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:37,920
Listen I want to talk
about the menu, right?

245
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:42,216
Now she's... oh yeah,
hail to the chick.

246
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:43,801
Good evening, Mrs. Khaled.

247
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:45,970
Ah, Good evening, Franco.

248
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:47,806
U mm that's good.

249
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:52,518
Darling, you look fantastic.

250
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,312
You look divine.

251
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,271
We must have lunch someday.
Yes, darling. Call me.

252
00:17:55,272 --> 00:18:01,028
He's good, there's nothing
else that I would rather be

253
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,573
The greatest pleasures
teach us soon

254
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:08,786
He's in the top with you

255
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:12,706
Mrs. Khaled.
Do I smell mouthwash'?

256
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:14,666
Just a little.

257
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,627
I didn't want to
spoil the flavor.

258
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:17,920
Why?

259
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:21,215
You reek of sex anyway,
it's your main attribute.

260
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:22,341
You're too kind.

261
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:23,425
Yes.

262
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,593
It's my main failing.

263
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:33,684
Franco, the music is much too loud.

264
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:34,728
Of course.

265
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:43,570
Tony.

266
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,489
Vanessa, darling.
Hello sweetheart,

267
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:47,865
you look terrific.
You look terrific.

268
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,951
Tony.

269
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:51,494
This is Marc.

270
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:52,204
How'd you do Marc?

271
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:53,038
Welcome to the club.

272
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,247
Thank you.

273
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:55,456
Is Jeremy here?

274
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:56,250
Later.

275
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,542
Why don't you come through?

276
00:18:57,543 --> 00:18:59,085
Life is very light.

277
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:01,380
Merry Christmas
and... we do our best.

278
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:03,673
How are you?

279
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:04,675
Hey, Leonard.

280
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,635
How are you?
Okay.

281
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:08,971
How was LA'?

282
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:12,056
Sinking slowly into the sea
as far as I could tell,

283
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:13,058
too slowly.

284
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:14,977
That's Maxine behind me.

285
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:18,730
Thank you my darling.

286
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:23,277
Have you heard from
Benjamin, darling?

287
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,404
Yes, he called me
from Switzerland twice.

288
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:26,863
How's the novel coming on?

289
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:28,365
Page by Page-

290
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:31,200
I see you brought your bit of
crimpy jail bait with you then dear.

291
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:33,578
Well, Denise... nah
she's an old age pensioner,

292
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,538
well preserved
like her highness.

293
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:36,914
Oh bitchy.

294
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:39,209
You better mind your tongue
dear she might bite it off.

295
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:40,002
Lucky her.

296
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,294
What did he say'?

297
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,254
Faggot

298
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:44,881
And how's little...
Alexandra?

299
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:45,965
Alexandra.

300
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,175
Is Alexandra liking Switzerland?

301
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:48,593
Well how the hell should I know?

302
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:50,136
She's his little brat, not mine.

303
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:51,387
Go stay with
somebody your own age.

304
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,930
Because I saved him from...

305
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,349
You're a nice old geezer,
but you don't own me honey.

306
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,727
But then I judge other writers
by what they write...

307
00:19:57,728 --> 00:19:59,645
myself, by my best intention.

308
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:00,980
What, the first Mrs. Khaled'?

309
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:02,148
Is she in London then?

310
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,774
No darling.

311
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:03,525
She's in Bark.

312
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:04,443
She is breeding pit ponies

313
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,777
and I understand they all
look exactly like her.

314
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:07,945
Oh beastly.

315
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:10,324
I think she's got
a stud there too.

316
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:13,493
This is a dance floor
not a geriatric pool.

317
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:14,745
All right.

318
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,871
That's enough, leave it out.

319
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,873
Hey, where the hell
are you taking him?

320
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,501
Please sit down.

321
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,169
Franco, get me and
my lady champagne.

322
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,462
She's dry from yelling.

323
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:25,130
Yes.

324
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:25,964
I'm right in.

325
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:27,591
Okay.

326
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,761
You can't leave him alone
for a moment, can you?

327
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:32,721
That's my job.

328
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:35,057
Well, come do a job with me.

329
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:47,611
I never could believe the
things you do to me

330
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,490
Never could believe
the way you are

331
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:54,409
Who is that?

332
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:56,245
That?

333
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:57,246
That's Molly.

334
00:20:58,038 --> 00:20:59,039
Molly?

335
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:01,458
What a divine name.

336
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:05,629
Everyone's a winner,
baby, that's the truth

337
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:09,841
Making love to you is
such a thrill

338
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:14,805
Everyone's a winner,
baby, that's no lie

339
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:16,682
You never fail

340
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:18,225
Amazing creature.

341
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,355
Is she part of your job too?

342
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:39,663
Look at her.

343
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,712
Never could explain just what
was happening to me

344
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:50,840
Just one touch of you
and I'm in flames

345
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,926
Doesn't that give you a hard on?

346
00:21:57,014 --> 00:22:01,351
My, my, my... I do believe
the boy is embarrassed.

347
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:08,275
Your very friendly
this evening madam.

348
00:22:09,318 --> 00:22:10,193
Everyone's a winner, baby,
that's the truth

349
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:11,486
Was my good enough for the lip?

350
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:18,744
Oh yes, it's about the one place
you are good enough, Tony?

351
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,749
Just bear that in
mind, won't you lover.

352
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:43,101
I'm leaving now tiger.

353
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,311
I'll call you tomorrow.

354
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,981
Oh and Tony turn the music down.

355
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:49,399
It's much too loud.

356
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,653
Franco, get her bag.

357
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:55,405
Fontaine.

358
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:56,448
Oh dear.

359
00:22:56,615 --> 00:22:57,324
How are you?

360
00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:58,492
Well looking good was it.

361
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:00,994
Be good...
I will.

362
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:21,472
Again my paperwork, and a
word in your shell like ear.

363
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:22,849
What is it'?

364
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:25,352
You fucking rock
stars are all the same.

365
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:26,061
No we're not.

366
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:28,145
We just look alike, that's all.

367
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:28,939
Hey mate.

368
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,315
Anyway, I'm just an
old fashioned crooner.

369
00:23:31,316 --> 00:23:33,234
You'll want to
lay off that stuff,

370
00:23:33,235 --> 00:23:35,319
one of these days
it's going to kill you.

371
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,115
Whoever heard of a seventy
year old rock star anyway?

372
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:41,117
You should try some, seventy
year old greeters aren't much

373
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,494
in demand either.

374
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:43,995
You know what I mean?

375
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,790
Out of the mouth of
babes and rock stars.

376
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,044
Well, that's really what I
wanted to talk to you about.

377
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:55,632
I'd like to open a new club.

378
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,093
What wrong with this one?
Nothing.

379
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:01,138
Except it's
neither yours nor mine.

380
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:04,223
Well that's two and
two, what's four?

381
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:08,019
You could put up the necessary
Dinero and I can find a

382
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:11,605
location, clientele,
catering, design, the lot.

383
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:14,191
This lot would pack it out in
Wimbledon if my name were over

384
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:15,401
the door, you know that.

385
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:17,842
Don't know if I like of the sound
of Wimbledon too much, Tony.

386
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,781
I'll tell you what?

387
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:22,367
Give me a couple of
days to think it over.

388
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:24,077
No promises but
I'll think about it.

389
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:25,912
Then we'll talk.

390
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:27,998
Sounds good.

391
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,499
It could give me some of the
figures on this place

392
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,501
in the meantime.

393
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:32,794
Yeah, sure.

394
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:41,552
Moonlighting

395
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:43,762
They're leaving everything

396
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:45,222
Moonlighting

397
00:24:45,223 --> 00:24:47,141
They're losing all their friends

398
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:48,852
Moonlighting

399
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:52,688
It's the only way
It's frightening

400
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:54,857
But it means they'll stay

401
00:24:54,858 --> 00:25:01,865
Together They're gonna
make it together

402
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:03,742
I'm not in love,

403
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:07,496
so don't forget it

404
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,293
It's just a silly phase
I'm going through

405
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:17,171
And just because

406
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:20,842
Sam... Nico.
Right.

407
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:24,888
I call you up Don't get me wrong

408
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:27,724
Don't think you've got it made

409
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:29,768
Where you from honey?

410
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:31,978
Center Page, of Playboy honey.

411
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:39,194
Oh, can't see any staple marks.

412
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:42,697
Oh don't you know, they
touch us up afterwards.

413
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:45,700
That's the kind of job I like.

414
00:25:49,704 --> 00:25:50,956
Looks like you've got it.

415
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,635
Not so hard Sandro.

416
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:06,762
Sorry madam but
there's so much tension.

417
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:08,556
I take Valium for
tension Sandro,

418
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:10,016
not punishment.

419
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:12,852
Why do you keep him?

420
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:13,895
Who?

421
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:15,230
Tony.

422
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:18,148
Darling, he's my masterpiece.

423
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,025
I own him.

424
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:21,819
I have turned a common waiter
into one of the most fancied

425
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,239
young men in London, more
or less with my bare hands.

426
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,410
I totally redid
him, clothes, hair,

427
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:33,872
even sex, especially sex.

428
00:26:33,873 --> 00:26:35,416
Do you know when
I first met him,

429
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,336
Tony thought that 69
was a bottle of scotch?

430
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:42,464
You're priceless.

431
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,467
Well, frightfully
expensive though.

432
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:47,554
Then when do I have him?

433
00:26:50,056 --> 00:26:53,602
Whenever you wish my darling,
unless it's not during club hours.

434
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:55,269
But wouldn't you be jealous?

435
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,646
Good God, it would be like
being jealous of a turnstile

436
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,024
at Regent's Park zoo.

437
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:04,403
I might even arrange it for you.

438
00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:06,572
Oh I've got
something to show you,

439
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:08,699
I think you'll be fascinated.

440
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,701
Will I?

441
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,206
Do I hurt you madam'?

442
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:19,084
I realized Sandro that
this is not your intention,

443
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:20,670
but you're getting me excited.

444
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:26,343
It's all right Sandro,
just bring me the phone.

445
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:33,098
Hello.

446
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:34,266
Good morning lover.

447
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:35,226
Oh, it's you.

448
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:36,477
Are you UP?

449
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:37,811
Yeah I'm awake but...

450
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:40,272
What do you mean 'but?

451
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:43,400
You're an early
riser, aren't you?

452
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:45,069
Good, then I'll
have all of it then,

453
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm coming over.

454
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,030
Coming over, coming over where?

455
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:51,784
Oh, I don't really
mind wherever... wherever,

456
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:55,496
besides I miss you.

457
00:27:55,497 --> 00:27:57,998
I've been lying here
thinking about you,

458
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:01,836
and I'm ready, I'll be
around in 10 minutes.

459
00:28:04,422 --> 00:28:05,423
God.

460
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,760
Hey, you do this
for a living huh?

461
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:10,970
Oh shut up.

462
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:15,225
Oh, well, I got one for
free from a real professional.

463
00:28:16,976 --> 00:28:19,103
Do I have to fill in
a form or something,

464
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:20,479
for your income tax?

465
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,647
Cut it out.

466
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:24,191
No, I mean if it's any
easier I don't mind paying.

467
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,818
Do you take Access?

468
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:27,736
Several times last
night, didn't I?

469
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:30,864
Okay, suppose we put the
little extras down to Diners

470
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:31,866
Club then.

471
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,661
It's not often I get the
chance to eat that much,

472
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:40,541
who does this one charge it to.

473
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:42,543
Come on, it's not like that.

474
00:28:42,544 --> 00:28:43,545
Sure I know?

475
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,964
You good looking
tarts are all the same.

476
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:48,645
Well, don't let me
keep you from your work.

477
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:09,987
I won't be long Sanders.

478
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:10,989
Very good, ma'am.

479
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:20,789
I've got 15 minutes Tony.

480
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,624
I'm late for the hair dressers.

481
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,085
Christ, I'm not a
machine you know.

482
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:27,338
In the meantime
lover, you will do.

483
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:39,850
What are you wearing tonight?

484
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:41,852
Oh I don't know, anything.

485
00:29:41,853 --> 00:29:45,272
Oh Fontaine you're
positively wicked,

486
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,774
you know that?

487
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,817
Yes, I am, aren't I?

488
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:51,403
I knew I should have
gone into the movies,

489
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:53,781
instead of wasting my
best years modeling,

490
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:55,282
they wanted me too.

491
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:57,993
How on earth did
you manage that?

492
00:29:57,994 --> 00:30:00,412
I can take a loss for an hour.

493
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:03,916
Practice darling, endless
practice a bit like ballet

494
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:04,918
lessons.

495
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:06,294
What's he doing?

496
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:12,007
He's looking at his watch...

497
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:13,634
cocky little bastard.

498
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,385
Oh this isn't fair.

499
00:30:15,386 --> 00:30:16,929
When are you going to
arrange him for me?

500
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,388
Yeah.

501
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:19,139
Maybe I'll give him
to you for Christmas.

502
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,933
You know I'm in Paris.

503
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,060
Oh yes I know.

504
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:24,646
Oh I love Paris.

505
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:31,110
Oh, ah.

506
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:45,041
Oh shit.

507
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:50,045
You look like shit.

508
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:51,463
Yeah, I've had a busy day.

509
00:30:51,464 --> 00:30:53,632
Still going
across the boss' wife.

510
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:54,925
You're playing a
mugs game, Tony.

511
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:56,176
She's got you both ways.

512
00:30:56,177 --> 00:30:57,219
You can't even blow the whistle,

513
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,887
right?

514
00:30:57,888 --> 00:31:00,597
Anytime I want, I can go.

515
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:01,640
What happens then?

516
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:03,601
All of sudden you're an
ex-manager of a night club.

517
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:05,443
She probably won't even
let you keep a jacket.

518
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:08,063
Might fit the next guy.

519
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:12,442
You got to use your head
first and your cock second.

520
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,028
Basic law of physics, that is.

521
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,573
Christ.

522
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:19,116
Creeps up on you, doesn't it'?

523
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:20,034
What'?

524
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:23,453
Age, darling, the
invisible enemy.

525
00:31:23,454 --> 00:31:25,539
Don't be silly,
you look incredible.

526
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,960
Hmm, I'm my own work of art.

527
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:33,589
Maybe if I could've had kids,
I'd be all nice and mummsy by

528
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,048
HOW.

529
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,925
I didn't know you
couldn't have kids.

530
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:40,596
Rather unfortunate
abortion, took care of that.

531
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:45,017
'Don't want them' sounds much
better than 'can't have them'.

532
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:47,686
Anyway at least I'm not
risking thrombosis from the

533
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:48,313
Pill.

534
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:50,814
You always said you hated kids.

535
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:53,609
Anyway, Leonard thinks you're
the most beautiful woman he's

536
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,402
ever 886D.

537
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,404
Does he now?

538
00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:00,074
You must remind me to
thank him properly.

539
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:04,411
Oh darling, you must
bring Tony to Paris,

540
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:06,289
then we can all have him.

541
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:08,833
All?

542
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:11,126
Maybe you should
take up the banjo,

543
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:12,336
Tony baby.

544
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:14,004
Always good to
have a second trade.

545
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:16,506
Nah... he's going to be a tap
dancer when the old trouser

546
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:17,967
snake lets him
down, ain't you tone.

547
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:21,762
Listen, you two toe rags.

548
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:24,431
In the not too distant future,
I'm going to make the pair of

549
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:26,100
you look like twin arseholes.

550
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:31,648
I've done the waiter bit,
I've done the manager a bit.

551
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:35,233
The next one is going
to have my name on it,

552
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,944
Tony's very own.

553
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:39,863
I've got a certain person to
put his limbs up and I'm going

554
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:41,115
to be making bread.

555
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,701
I'll blow the whistle on the
performing bit when I feel

556
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:46,787
like it right now I
don't feel like it.

557
00:32:46,788 --> 00:32:48,581
I enjoy it. Right?

558
00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:50,083
End of story.

559
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,505
What's Glen like in bed?

560
00:32:56,714 --> 00:32:59,299
Well, inventive.

561
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,926
Inventive?

562
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:02,219
Hmm.

563
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,389
I always thought he
was a trifle gay.

564
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:10,185
I must say invention isn't
one of Tony's strong suits.

565
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:14,189
With him it's more of a matter
of... enthusiasm and staying

566
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,191
hard.

567
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:18,610
You know, I think
Paris is a fantastic idea.

568
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,487
We could do some
Christmas shopping.

569
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:21,613
I need a new coat.

570
00:33:21,614 --> 00:33:23,074
What would you do about Ben?

571
00:33:23,825 --> 00:33:27,285
Oh Ben... he'll be far too busy
fawning over his daughter to

572
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:28,996
worry about what I am doing.

573
00:33:28,997 --> 00:33:32,249
He'll probably be grateful to
me for getting out his way.

574
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,251
Very considerate
of you, darling.

575
00:33:34,252 --> 00:33:37,421
Do you mind if I watch it again?

576
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:39,464
Now I know what I'm
getting for Christmas.

577
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:40,633
Be my guest.

578
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:50,809
About Fontaine
Khaled, she's using you.

579
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,479
Listen, Fontaine
Khaled is a beautiful,

580
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,189
intelligent woman.

581
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,816
She's a ball breaker.

582
00:33:57,817 --> 00:33:59,484
She gave me a chance.

583
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:00,944
She wanted you to screw.

584
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:05,073
Eh, you're unhappy because I
pull beautiful ladies and you

585
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:07,200
have to pay for your cufflinks
by dicking over old age

586
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:08,202
pensions.

587
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:11,496
Don't tell me I'm schmuck.

588
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:13,248
It's only my hobby.

589
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:14,750
What are you doing
in your spare time,

590
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:15,835
make model airplanes?

591
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,213
All right, Warren Beatty,
you stick to your hobby.

592
00:34:20,214 --> 00:34:22,841
You can nail it to the wall
when it doesn't work anymore.

593
00:34:22,842 --> 00:34:25,010
That is unless
someone nails it for you.

594
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,386
Well, it won't be you.

595
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:28,890
You're too busy wheeling
bath chairs round now.

596
00:34:33,227 --> 00:34:35,979
Let me tell you something
about those old dragons.

597
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,648
Their husbands are usually dead.

598
00:34:39,192 --> 00:34:41,778
How's Mr. Khaled?

599
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,244
So, which bright young things
do we have the pleasure of

600
00:34:51,245 --> 00:34:52,788
this evening?

601
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:56,166
Mario's is with Gordon
and Alex is with Peter,

602
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,168
of course.

603
00:34:57,835 --> 00:34:59,211
Christ.

604
00:34:59,212 --> 00:35:02,089
Another one of those
upper class itentikits.

605
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,715
Peter's a very nice boy.

606
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:04,592
Alex likes him.

607
00:35:04,593 --> 00:35:06,384
She always has done.

608
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:08,553
I think they are
very well suited.

609
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,932
Maybe they can all live
happily ever after then.

610
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:12,892
Is that so wrong?

611
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:16,103
It's all so boring.

612
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:16,729
He is boring.

613
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:17,480
She's boring.

614
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:19,397
They all bore the arse of me.

615
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:22,317
I hope you won't be using
language like that in front of

616
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:23,069
her.

617
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,321
It's that puritanical attitude
of yours that makes me talk

618
00:35:26,322 --> 00:35:27,572
like that around her.

619
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:29,991
You know she can't bare me to
be more attractive than her

620
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:31,076
own mother.

621
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:33,870
So you'll make it up to her
by treating me like a servant

622
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:34,997
whenever she's around.

623
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:39,168
Do I really treat
you like a servant?

624
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:42,380
Well, no.

625
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:47,300
No, not really.

626
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:51,012
But she doesn't like me and
you know I just can't help the

627
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:52,514
way that makes me behave.

628
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:54,432
She won't be here for long.

629
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:57,978
But she is my daughter and I
can't refuse her to stay in my

630
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,105
house.

631
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,316
Must you absolutely be
here until the New Years,

632
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:04,318
darling?

633
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:06,194
Yes, I'm afraid so, why?

634
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:10,198
Oh, Vanessa and Leonard
have asked us to Paris for

635
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,159
Christmas.

636
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,040
It would have been
divine if we could have gone.

637
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:15,245
Why don't you 90'?

638
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:18,665
Oh, it wouldn't be the same
without you after all it is

639
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,417
Christmas.

640
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:20,584
Don't be silly.

641
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:22,752
Do some shopping,
have a marvelous time,

642
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:24,297
you'll be back by Christmas Eve.

643
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:30,719
Well, I shall have to
bring you something very,

644
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,971
very special then.

645
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:46,151
You get too much You get too
much And I know I'll get you

646
00:36:46,152 --> 00:36:49,655
back And gentleman in England...

647
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:52,658
Where is Mr. Blake?

648
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:53,409
He's in the store.

649
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:54,160
Go and get him.

650
00:36:54,161 --> 00:37:00,665
We're not here in this piss
hole for you boring farts and

651
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:07,881
hold their manhood, see while
any speak of those who fart

652
00:37:07,882 --> 00:37:11,802
and fight upon the
same Christians.

653
00:37:14,805 --> 00:37:19,184
Oh Tony, get your bum
chums off and get Bowsy a

654
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:20,269
drinkington.

655
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:25,066
Thank God for Harry,
England and Tony Blake.

656
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,194
Ladies and gentlemen...

657
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,531
Mr. Tony...

658
00:37:34,116 --> 00:37:35,952
Take it easy Bowsy, please.

659
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:43,083
Hey Tony... why don't you and
I drop our trousers and see

660
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:44,918
whose got the
biggest willy in the room,

661
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:45,920
eh?

662
00:37:46,837 --> 00:37:48,214
Come on, off we go.

663
00:37:52,843 --> 00:37:54,053
You disappoint me, Blake.

664
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:56,597
I thought you had more style.

665
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:02,561
He used to kiss my arse
when he was a waiter.

666
00:38:04,563 --> 00:38:08,401
You're nothing but a working
class bum in Gucci shoes.

667
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:16,116
Listen Franco, I don't want to
see his fat little face again.

668
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:17,993
Yeah, maybe it's best that...

669
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:18,911
If he wants to
shoot his mouth of,

670
00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:21,329
he can go do it in the
House of Lords not in my club.

671
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,331
Right.

672
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,961
Don't let the ruling
classes ruffle your feathers,

673
00:38:27,962 --> 00:38:28,838
right.

674
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,171
Ah, Fontaine.

675
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:31,923
Good evening, Tony.

676
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:33,842
We are going out for a party
so we shan't be here very

677
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:35,468
long, but let me introduce you.

678
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:36,720
Hello.

679
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:39,764
And his sister,
Madeline, Gordon Brown,

680
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:41,766
and this is my
daughter Alexandra.

681
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:44,060
This is Tony Blake
who runs the club.

682
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:47,397
Alex is a bit young for night
clubs but I don't think she'll

683
00:38:47,398 --> 00:38:48,690
come to any harm here, do you?

684
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:49,733
Of course not.

685
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:50,693
Which one is Alex?

686
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:52,110
She is the one in
the fairy frock,

687
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:53,570
talking to Tony.

688
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:54,738
Who is that man
being thrown out?

689
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,406
Oh, that was one of
our titled customers.

690
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:58,867
We get all the Lords and
Ladies and layabouts down

691
00:38:58,868 --> 00:38:59,493
here.

692
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,453
DO you?

693
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:02,038
I don't seem to
recognize anybody.

694
00:39:03,122 --> 00:39:06,875
Well, they often look
different in real life.

695
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:08,252
Is this real life'?

696
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:13,173
Peter was just telling
us about an expedition

697
00:39:13,174 --> 00:39:14,008
he went on to.

698
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:15,009
Where was it Peter?

699
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,843
They Hindu Kush, actually.

700
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:20,013
I think the younger generation
is very adventurous these

701
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:21,223
days.

702
00:39:23,851 --> 00:39:25,852
We took the train from Bombay.

703
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:27,812
Of course they are
still using steam trains.

704
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,981
Do I get enamored
with a noble lord,

705
00:39:29,982 --> 00:39:33,318
Shakespeare in
flights, Henry five,

706
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,486
one of the better moments.

707
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:36,738
I hate to hear one
of his worst moments.

708
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:38,365
You saw Mt Everest
too, didn't you?

709
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:40,241
I suppose it would
be hard to miss.

710
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:41,618
Well, it certainly
is quite a sight.

711
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,579
You can see the main
peak for about 200 miles.

712
00:39:44,455 --> 00:39:47,040
Goodness knows how anyone's
brave enough to climb the top.

713
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,584
I think they're all stoned
out of their minds before they

714
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:50,586
start.

715
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,546
I think it's terrific.

716
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:00,720
I see it closing in the
morning before breakfast.

717
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:02,180
She's awful.

718
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:05,058
She was always giving me
those funny looks during P.E.

719
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:06,560
She was probably a raving dyke,

720
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:09,979
and I'm sure you'd
be very attracted to

721
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,648
that sort of person.

722
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:12,315
Shall we go and dance, Gordon?

723
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:13,942
Well, actually I
don't dance very well,

724
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:14,568
I'm afraid.

725
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:16,319
Well go and dance, so that
they don't have to sit here

726
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,613
and watch you pick your teeth.

727
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:21,534
Is that alright?

728
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:23,618
Yes of course, go
on enjoy yourself.

729
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:24,619
Come on Gordon.

730
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,371
Well, what do you
think of the club?

731
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,247
Why did you make
fun of him like that?

732
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:30,376
Tony, beware of the
cock in the tail.

733
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,212
God, Jesus.

734
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:40,301
Who is the princess then?

735
00:40:40,302 --> 00:40:42,387
Oh hold on, Benjamin
Khaled's daughter,

736
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:43,847
now would you believe that.

737
00:40:43,848 --> 00:40:45,391
Don't know if you
believe it yourself.

738
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:54,107
Now Alex darling however
Fontaine behaves to you

739
00:40:54,108 --> 00:40:56,443
whatever she
does... she can never...

740
00:40:56,444 --> 00:40:57,485
Excuse me.

741
00:40:57,486 --> 00:40:59,154
Have you seen, Madeline?

742
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:01,239
I've seemed to have
lost her in the crush.

743
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,408
Why don't you sit down.

744
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:05,702
She can never affect our
relationship you know that?

745
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:08,663
Daddy, I know that, but she's
so impossible and so rude to

746
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:09,415
my friends.

747
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:10,666
It's part of growing up.

748
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:13,376
How is the family
outing getting along?

749
00:41:13,377 --> 00:41:14,961
Huh, wonderful.

750
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:17,589
Little Miss Muffet and Winnie
the Pooh are making googoo

751
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,631
eyes at each other.

752
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:21,134
The other moron is taking
his horrific girlfriend for

753
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:23,428
dancing lessons and I'm
behaving like a bitch.

754
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:27,098
When Ben gives me his Arab
glares even Tony seems to have

755
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:28,266
turned to stone this evening.

756
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:30,478
Have you said
anything to Ben about Paris?

757
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,896
That's the one thing that's
kept me from screaming in his

758
00:41:32,897 --> 00:41:33,230
face.

759
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,064
And he said yes?

760
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:35,399
He said yes.

761
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,901
I'm flying over
with you tomorrow.

762
00:41:37,902 --> 00:41:38,527
Marvelous.

763
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:39,361
What did you tell him?

764
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:41,988
Oh, he thinks he's
doing it for Alexandra.

765
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:46,075
So that I'm not around to
criticize the yodeling and she

766
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:48,995
can't bore me to death
with her sixth form brain.

767
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:50,706
And what about my Tony?

768
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:54,959
Your Tony... hmm.

769
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,004
Well, I think that we should
keep Tony in the dark until we

770
00:41:58,005 --> 00:41:58,839
share him up.

771
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,174
You know, he's only used to
having one woman at a time.

772
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:02,258
We wouldn't want to
frighten him off,

773
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:03,219
would we?

774
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,428
I love the TV special.

775
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,263
Has anyone else taped him?

776
00:42:07,264 --> 00:42:07,848
No.

777
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:10,016
I think I'm the only one
who starred opposite him.

778
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:11,309
And you haven't got Ben as well?

779
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,937
God forbid.

780
00:42:13,938 --> 00:42:15,897
Ben gets his cock
sucked once a month,

781
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:19,068
always in the dark and
never ever in the lift.

782
00:42:21,654 --> 00:42:24,405
When he drop you off And
he said to you girl oh...

783
00:42:24,406 --> 00:42:26,115
So this is Tony, eh?

784
00:42:26,116 --> 00:42:26,992
Nice to meet you, Tony.

785
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:27,660
Nice to meet you.

786
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:28,826
Well, I'm just happy about it.

787
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:29,912
Oh thank you very much.

788
00:42:30,412 --> 00:42:31,413
Mr. Blake.

789
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,415
How is it going my dear?

790
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:34,916
There's too many
people in the restaurant.

791
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:36,167
Have you seen my wife?

792
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:36,877
No, I didn't.

793
00:42:36,878 --> 00:42:38,504
She's always
fucking on somebody.

794
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:40,130
Hello Tony.

795
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,674
Hello over here.

796
00:42:42,258 --> 00:42:43,133
There she's...

797
00:42:43,134 --> 00:42:48,346
Ah, Vanessa, I should
like to go home now.

798
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:49,514
No, we'll go and dance.

799
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:50,349
"Don't be such a drag.

800
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:51,308
You're going to dance.

801
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,643
Oh go and dance.

802
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:53,805
Come on, I'll practice here.

803
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:03,069
Making me rooms and why don't
you allow that These brand new

804
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:06,489
ones Out in the shadow
searching for someone For

805
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:11,077
someone To set you free
From New York City...

806
00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:12,412
Hi, Tony.

807
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:13,871
You're running
the club very good.

808
00:43:13,872 --> 00:43:15,123
Is everything all right?

809
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:17,709
It's just be... it's just that
we have had another engagement

810
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,419
I can't keep them
waiting too long of course.

811
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,004
Ah superman.

812
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:22,547
What have you done with
your little girlfriend?

813
00:43:22,548 --> 00:43:24,757
Well, I've sort of
lost her actually.

814
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,718
Oh and I'm sure you'll find
her when they sweep up in the

815
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:27,720
morning.

816
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:28,970
I'll take out with some
service, all right.

817
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:29,555
I'm going to Paris.

818
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:31,681
Oh thank you.

819
00:43:31,682 --> 00:43:33,016
"Can I catch a lift, sir?

820
00:43:33,017 --> 00:43:34,685
I think I should be
getting along as well.

821
00:43:35,227 --> 00:43:36,604
Would be delighted to, yes.

822
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:40,149
Your car's waiting, sir

823
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:47,989
Hello stranger you are an
angel To the love I knew

824
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,991
Hello darling.

825
00:43:49,825 --> 00:43:50,826
Hello.

826
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:51,952
You want to dance?

827
00:43:52,286 --> 00:43:54,329
Oh, no really I couldn't.

828
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:54,997
Of course you could.

829
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:55,998
No really.

830
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:57,750
How old are you?

831
00:43:58,292 --> 00:43:59,751
I'm 16.

832
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:00,793
Awful, isn't it?

833
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:02,670
Hmm, that's lovely.

834
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:03,672
You're a virgin?

835
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:09,844
Well, fortunately
you're talking to a man who

836
00:44:09,845 --> 00:44:11,930
specializes in
such diseases. Oh.

837
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:17,393
Sorry, I'm a lady Sorry,
I'm a lady I would rather be

838
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:21,022
Rather be Just a little shady

839
00:44:21,023 --> 00:44:22,065
Just a little shady
Naughty dynamite

840
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:23,107
Who is he?

841
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:25,985
Oh, he wants me
to dance I think.

842
00:44:25,986 --> 00:44:28,905
Bloody boots,
forget about dancing,

843
00:44:28,906 --> 00:44:31,240
probably walking too.

844
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:33,117
I should have worn my flats.

845
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:36,245
I'm so fed up with looking
like a cute little dumpling.

846
00:44:36,246 --> 00:44:38,374
I want to be groove bit.

847
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:41,042
Can we go soon?

848
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:42,627
Yes, I suppose so.

849
00:44:42,628 --> 00:44:43,795
Alex...

850
00:44:43,796 --> 00:44:44,837
Franco, now she's gone.

851
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:46,173
Turn the music up for me.

852
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:48,425
Yes, sure.

853
00:45:00,688 --> 00:45:01,689
Well...

854
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,981
Well...

855
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:05,817
Funny place, wasn't it?

856
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:06,819
What was funny?

857
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,530
Well, you know the...

858
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:13,157
Oh, all those old
men and young girls.

859
00:45:13,158 --> 00:45:14,159
Sure.

860
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:15,869
Funny really.

861
00:45:16,704 --> 00:45:17,705
Peter.

862
00:45:17,996 --> 00:45:18,997
Hmm.

863
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:20,332
Kiss me.

864
00:45:22,126 --> 00:45:23,127
Yes, of course.

865
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:35,222
What's the matter?

866
00:45:36,014 --> 00:45:37,015
Nothing, nothing.

867
00:45:47,735 --> 00:45:49,402
Crikey.

868
00:45:49,403 --> 00:45:50,404
What's wrong?

869
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,991
It's just that I don't want
Maddy to come out and find us

870
00:45:54,992 --> 00:45:57,119
in the throws of fore play
before we're even engaged.

871
00:45:58,412 --> 00:45:59,955
Oh my God.

872
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,292
The door.

873
00:46:04,668 --> 00:46:05,669
Yes of course.

874
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:18,639
What are you doing?

875
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,641
Oh it's you.

876
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:21,810
What is that?

877
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:23,687
And you're supposed
to be looking after...

878
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:26,397
I was going to tell right away,

879
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:27,440
really I was.

880
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:29,400
But you weren't here.

881
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:30,402
What you're doing?

882
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:33,821
I heard it all in the loo
and then we left with Peter,

883
00:46:33,822 --> 00:46:35,239
but I couldn't tell
you in front of him,

884
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,200
could I?

885
00:46:36,201 --> 00:46:37,201
Heard what?

886
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:41,496
They were talking, she and
that rinsed out blond friend

887
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:42,498
of hers.

888
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:45,834
They're going to Paris
with him for an orgy.

889
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,127
But I don't think
he knows it yet.

890
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:51,506
I don't know if
Daddy would know.

891
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:53,007
Never let them get away with it.

892
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:54,300
He doesn't know.

893
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:55,469
They said so.

894
00:46:56,136 --> 00:46:58,930
She said he thinks she's going
to Paris to get out of your

895
00:46:58,931 --> 00:47:00,723
way really it's to...

896
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:01,725
what you're doing?

897
00:47:02,184 --> 00:47:04,894
It looks like he's
pretty good at it.

898
00:47:04,895 --> 00:47:06,729
"Which is more than
your brother can say.

899
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,066
Oh Alex you're not
going to ...not with him.

900
00:47:10,067 --> 00:47:13,277
Fontaine would hate
it, wouldn't she?

901
00:47:13,278 --> 00:47:15,988
She said she doesn't
care who he does it with.

902
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:18,324
She says that's what he is for.

903
00:47:18,325 --> 00:47:20,159
We'll have to take
her word for it,

904
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,161
wouldn't we?

905
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,456
Lying in my bed on the 40th
floor suddenly crunched

906
00:47:25,457 --> 00:47:26,707
in through the window.

907
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:30,002
He flies covered in blood and
glass and I just can't believe

908
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:31,004
what's happening.

909
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:33,298
I mean it's just the
most ridiculous thing.

910
00:47:33,882 --> 00:47:36,425
Is Miss Khaled upstairs.

911
00:47:36,426 --> 00:47:37,760
She wants to speak to you.

912
00:47:37,761 --> 00:47:38,512
Who?

913
00:47:38,513 --> 00:47:40,388
Daughter of Mr. Khaled.

914
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,640
Is she... alone?

915
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:43,642
Yeah.

916
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:45,227
Champagne.

917
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:52,067
Hello.

918
00:47:52,568 --> 00:47:53,569
Hi.

919
00:47:53,986 --> 00:47:56,071
I hope I haven't dragged
you away from anybody.

920
00:47:57,155 --> 00:47:58,281
My pleasure.

921
00:47:58,282 --> 00:47:59,407
What can I do for you?

922
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:01,075
Well you could let
me in if you would.

923
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:02,368
Well, in the club.

924
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:03,370
Yes.

925
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:05,288
It is not against the rules?

926
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:06,665
I make the rules.

927
00:48:12,129 --> 00:48:13,212
Welcome back.

928
00:48:13,213 --> 00:48:14,006
Thank you.

929
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:15,256
You do like it here.

930
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:16,216
Yes I did.

931
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:18,050
Am I allowed to sit here?

932
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:19,552
I wouldn't want to
upset your hierarchy.

933
00:48:19,553 --> 00:48:21,263
I don't think you
would upset anything.

934
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:23,223
Oh I might.

935
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:26,268
Take it from me you're the
least upsetting person I've

936
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,393
met in my life.

937
00:48:27,394 --> 00:48:28,854
I suppose that is a compliment.

938
00:48:30,355 --> 00:48:31,356
It is.

939
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:36,778
You are actually old
enough to drink, huh?

940
00:48:37,362 --> 00:48:38,613
Everything is quite legal.

941
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:39,615
Don't worry.

942
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:46,120
Well, where do we begin?

943
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:47,496
What do you suggest?

944
00:48:47,497 --> 00:48:48,581
Like to dance.

945
00:48:48,582 --> 00:48:49,583
No.

946
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:51,126
Eat?

947
00:48:51,126 --> 00:48:51,793
No.

948
00:48:51,794 --> 00:48:54,337
Well then, what
would you like to do?

949
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:56,130
Perhaps you could take me home.

950
00:48:56,131 --> 00:48:57,883
What now, you just got here.

951
00:48:59,509 --> 00:49:01,511
Well, if that's what you want.

952
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:08,143
Almost...

953
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:18,153
What's the rush?

954
00:49:19,112 --> 00:49:21,030
You don't turn into
a pumpkin, do you?

955
00:49:21,031 --> 00:49:22,949
Not if you take
me to your house,

956
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:23,951
otherwise I might.

957
00:49:29,998 --> 00:49:32,083
Mind these steps I don't
think they've been cleaned for

958
00:49:32,084 --> 00:49:32,501
months.

959
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:37,506
Bloody cleaner, I don't
know why the door is open.

960
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:40,175
All right.

961
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,721
Damn.

962
00:49:45,305 --> 00:49:46,807
Someone must have
cut the lights off.

963
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:49,601
I'm only ever here in the day.

964
00:49:55,232 --> 00:49:56,233
Be careful.

965
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:58,610
I'll make some coffee.

966
00:50:00,654 --> 00:50:01,655
What'?

967
00:50:03,824 --> 00:50:04,908
Electric kettle.

968
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:06,994
Never mind.

969
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:30,809
Do you want to go to bed?

970
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:36,773
Well, just like that?

971
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,779
We reach the
stars Beyond the star,

972
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:53,407
almost To Jupiter,
yes To Venus and mars,

973
00:50:54,833 --> 00:51:02,833
yeah, almost I've won and lost
me a bet or two Making each

974
00:51:08,138 --> 00:51:16,138
lover routine Now do I
have a regret or two,

975
00:51:17,105 --> 00:51:25,105
almost Almost

976
00:52:05,153 --> 00:52:09,783
Hey, sugar, it's almost morning.

977
00:52:15,997 --> 00:52:17,624
Do you think
Fontaine is attractive?

978
00:52:21,628 --> 00:52:25,924
Put it this way, if I had two
choices you'd be both of them.

979
00:52:31,096 --> 00:52:32,847
It's going to be Christmas soon,

980
00:52:32,848 --> 00:52:33,640
what are you doing'?

981
00:52:33,641 --> 00:52:36,058
I'm seeing mommy this weekend,
I'll probably stay there.

982
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,393
Are you?

983
00:52:37,394 --> 00:52:38,270
Where's that?

984
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:39,604
A cottage in the country.

985
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:43,817
Would you like to come with me?

986
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:45,360
Mm-hmm.

987
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:46,361
How's that?

988
00:52:47,696 --> 00:52:50,699
I tell you how that
is, I think I love you.

989
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:52,951
I hope you would.

990
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,661
Will you call me later?

991
00:52:55,245 --> 00:52:57,414
What, in Paris'?

992
00:52:59,124 --> 00:53:00,125
What are you thinking?

993
00:53:01,084 --> 00:53:03,377
Dye your eyes green, it might
suit you and I tell you what,

994
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:04,837
dye your hair green
and change your shirt.

995
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:06,839
What are you so
bleeding cheerful about?

996
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,216
Its life man, its life.

997
00:53:09,217 --> 00:53:10,426
Oh knickers.

998
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:12,261
The lady goes away for
a couple of days you're

999
00:53:12,262 --> 00:53:12,804
ecstatic.

1000
00:53:12,805 --> 00:53:14,847
If she comes back you're
bleeding suicidal again.

1001
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:16,098
I can handle it.

1002
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:17,558
Anyway this one is different.

1003
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:18,601
What's different about it'?

1004
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:19,643
Hey, mind the pins will you.

1005
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:21,061
It's like fucking acupuncture.

1006
00:53:21,062 --> 00:53:22,855
Which side do you dress sir?

1007
00:53:22,856 --> 00:53:24,231
On the right, I'm a south pole.

1008
00:53:24,232 --> 00:53:24,733
Thank you.

1009
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,442
It's not like that
with this one Sammy.

1010
00:53:26,443 --> 00:53:28,944
If I didn't know you better
I'd say cupid was up your

1011
00:53:28,945 --> 00:53:29,945
arse, Antonio.

1012
00:53:29,946 --> 00:53:31,989
I'd say love was
rearing it's ugly head,

1013
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:34,783
my son, which for a bright
young lad your position is a

1014
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:35,910
bleeding disaster.

1015
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:36,703
Bullshit.

1016
00:53:36,704 --> 00:53:38,621
Yeah, but delightfully served.

1017
00:53:38,622 --> 00:53:40,581
What's wrong with me being
in love with her anyway?

1018
00:53:40,582 --> 00:53:41,374
It does happen.

1019
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,751
Not with you and then
diamond studded hippos,

1020
00:53:43,752 --> 00:53:46,545
I know, but it does happen.

1021
00:53:46,546 --> 00:53:48,923
Personally, I'm tired of
putting it in everything that

1022
00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:49,924
winks at me.

1023
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:51,842
I don't care if I'm
in love with her.

1024
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:53,552
I want to be in love with her.

1025
00:53:53,553 --> 00:53:54,554
Wrong.

1026
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:00,352
What you think, then?

1027
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:03,395
Jacket looks fine,
you, you look fucked.

1028
00:54:03,396 --> 00:54:04,939
Yeah, I was last night.

1029
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,941
Top it all, she nicked 15
quid of me while I was still

1030
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:07,192
kipping.

1031
00:54:07,193 --> 00:54:08,484
You can't trust them, can you?

1032
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:10,153
I've been telling
you that for years.

1033
00:54:12,072 --> 00:54:13,656
Look at me and learn, babes.

1034
00:54:13,657 --> 00:54:14,574
Yeah, look at you.

1035
00:54:14,575 --> 00:54:15,742
The tie matches your eyes.

1036
00:54:16,576 --> 00:54:17,743
That Khaled had been
coming a little bit

1037
00:54:17,744 --> 00:54:18,703
stronger last night with you?

1038
00:54:18,704 --> 00:54:20,162
Mind your own business.

1039
00:54:20,163 --> 00:54:22,373
What are you doing now
mother daughter act?

1040
00:54:22,374 --> 00:54:23,666
What are you talking about?

1041
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:24,417
You haven't forgotten

1042
00:54:24,418 --> 00:54:25,709
who your boss is, have you?

1043
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:26,586
Fontaine.

1044
00:54:26,587 --> 00:54:28,003
What she got to do with it?

1045
00:54:28,004 --> 00:54:29,421
Oh, nothing sweetheart.

1046
00:54:29,422 --> 00:54:31,632
She's only the wife of
this fair damsel's father,

1047
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:32,913
who you're
screwing twice a week.

1048
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:35,844
You are going to need a pair
of dark glasses and a white

1049
00:54:35,845 --> 00:54:36,846
stick pretty soon.

1050
00:54:37,305 --> 00:54:38,514
If you really want a broad?

1051
00:54:38,515 --> 00:54:39,516
How about Mamie'?

1052
00:54:40,016 --> 00:54:42,142
At least she could
bank roll you, right?

1053
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:46,647
Yeah, another Fontaine deal,
only this one's old and ugly.

1054
00:54:46,648 --> 00:54:48,524
"Hark at these
two, rent a pricks.

1055
00:54:48,525 --> 00:54:51,860
Thanks for the offer Hal,
I've got other avenues.

1056
00:54:51,861 --> 00:54:54,864
You got dead ends
baby, dead ends.

1057
00:55:08,003 --> 00:55:09,003

York City And love,

1064
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:45,539
love is just a passing word
It's the thought you had in a

1065
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:53,540
taxi cab that got left on the
curb When he dropped you off

1066
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:58,427
and he stated
firm Oh, oh, oh (oh,

1079
00:57:54,002 --> 00:57:56,211
You're confirmed on the
10 o'clock flight to Orly.

1080
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:59,673
You'll be met, something
about opening a club in Paris.

1081
00:57:59,674 --> 00:58:00,717
Oh shit.

1082
00:58:18,193 --> 00:58:19,359
A bit early isn't it?

1083
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,903
How're you keeping?

1084
00:58:20,904 --> 00:58:22,489
Well, very well.

1085
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:26,533
Listen, I'm getting those
figures for you tomorrow.

1086
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:27,618
Figures?

1087
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:29,203
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:58:29,204 --> 00:58:31,413
It should be most revealing.

1089
00:58:31,414 --> 00:58:33,624
So... make it a
gold mine this place.

1090
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:36,543
Well, we'll call our
place the gold mine,

1091
00:58:36,544 --> 00:58:37,295
shall we?

1092
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:40,589
All in good time
sweetheart, all in good time.

1093
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:43,091
I can start looking for
premises before Christmas.

1094
00:58:43,092 --> 00:58:45,761
All I need is your okay and
we'll start emptying this

1095
00:58:45,762 --> 00:58:47,930
place into our own pockets.

1096
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:52,434
That's a very good idea
Tony, very good idea.

1097
00:58:52,435 --> 00:58:54,687
Well, when?

1098
00:58:58,775 --> 00:59:00,568
"Soon as I've had
a piss, partner.

1099
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:06,365
Listen, I'm serious.

1100
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:09,285
Yeah, it's a very
serious business.

1101
00:59:10,787 --> 00:59:13,038
Give me a call over Christmas.

1102
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,416
We'll sort something out, okay?

1103
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:17,418
Okay.

1104
00:59:21,005 --> 00:59:24,592
Tell me, where does Fontaine
Khaled come into all this?

1105
00:59:27,387 --> 00:59:31,349
Nowhere, it's just you and me.

1106
00:59:32,392 --> 00:59:37,689
Oh, it's a shame,
lovely lady, right'?

1107
00:59:45,989 --> 00:59:46,823
Pafis?

1108
00:59:46,824 --> 00:59:48,615
Yeah, well what
else could I say?

1109
00:59:48,616 --> 00:59:50,701
I'd be basking in Shit Street
for the New Year if I had say

1110
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:52,119
no, wouldn't I?

1111
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,538
If it had been the New Year, I
would've totally get run out,

1112
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:54,956
wouldn't I?

1113
00:59:54,956 --> 00:59:55,540
Why?

1114
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,124
Santa Claus
bringing you a new job,

1115
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,084
is he?

1116
00:59:58,085 --> 01:00:00,002
Well, don't screw his
reindeer when he does,

1117
01:00:00,003 --> 01:00:00,545
will you?

1118
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:02,463
One of them might turn
out to be your boss.

1119
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:06,091
Listen, you 4O
year old teenager,

1120
01:00:06,092 --> 01:00:08,552
I got Thane backing me in a
new club in a couple of weeks'

1121
01:00:08,553 --> 01:00:11,346
time and then I can
tell her it can run out.

1122
01:00:11,347 --> 01:00:15,809
Give this to Thane and let
Franco have the books back,

1123
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:16,811
all right.

1124
01:00:17,186 --> 01:00:18,187
Yeah, sure.

1125
01:00:25,194 --> 01:00:26,320
You comfy back there.

1126
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:27,362
It'll do.

1127
01:00:27,363 --> 01:00:29,866
Here, take a couple of these.

1128
01:00:30,617 --> 01:00:33,077
Keep your eyeballs open
even if your brain falls out.

1129
01:00:36,998 --> 01:00:38,206
What are they?

1130
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:42,045
Uppers, you know, keep
you on top of it all.

1131
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:45,089
Paris.

1132
01:01:04,192 --> 01:01:06,276
Welcome to Paris, Cheri.

1133
01:01:06,277 --> 01:01:07,278
Bon Jour.

1134
01:01:15,078 --> 01:01:18,622
So, what have you been doing'?

1135
01:01:18,623 --> 01:01:20,415
Anyone I should know about?

1136
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:24,504
Look, are you serious
about opening a club here?

1137
01:01:25,171 --> 01:01:26,588
Of course not.

1138
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:28,633
That was just an
excuse to get you here.

1139
01:01:29,425 --> 01:01:31,093
Well, I don't like being
summoned like piece of

1140
01:01:31,094 --> 01:01:32,344
luggage.

1141
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:33,346
Oh.

1142
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:39,894
It's a nice coat.

1143
01:01:40,645 --> 01:01:41,646
Is it new?

1144
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:43,397
This?

1145
01:01:43,398 --> 01:01:44,439
No.

1146
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,733
I've had it for hours.

1147
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:48,403
Jeez.

1148
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:51,154
Oh lover you're so predictable,

1149
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:53,741
never late and always shocked.

1150
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,830
Look, I'm really
tired from the trip.

1151
01:02:00,623 --> 01:02:03,375
But I bought this
especially for you.

1152
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:06,963
Anyway, you don't get
jet lagged flying from London.

1153
01:02:08,423 --> 01:02:10,925
This will wake you up.

1154
01:02:15,096 --> 01:02:18,306
Oh lover we're going
to have a divine time.

1155
01:02:18,307 --> 01:02:22,937
This is going to be
a night to remember.

1156
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:30,485
Now you just relax and I
will do all of the work.

1157
01:02:30,486 --> 01:02:32,572
I will show you the French way.

1158
01:02:39,162 --> 01:02:41,705
This house is the only
brilliant thing that Leonard

1159
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:42,956
ever created.

1160
01:02:42,957 --> 01:02:45,917
He keeps on babbling on about
all those scripts that he

1161
01:02:45,918 --> 01:02:48,295
sends to Hollywood and
they all end up on the reject

1162
01:02:48,296 --> 01:02:49,255
shelf.

1163
01:02:49,256 --> 01:02:50,797
Amazing.

1164
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:53,175
And he does it all
with Vanessa's money too.

1165
01:02:53,176 --> 01:02:54,177
Look at the parrot.

1166
01:02:55,845 --> 01:02:56,471
Hello.

1167
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:57,346
Bon Jour.

1168
01:02:57,347 --> 01:02:59,474
Come on lover,
they're waiting for us.

1169
01:03:03,644 --> 01:03:07,397
Well darling, here he is and
in excellent working order.

1170
01:03:07,398 --> 01:03:08,940
Tony, welcome to the feast.

1171
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:09,776
Hello Leonard.

1172
01:03:09,777 --> 01:03:11,526
Come and sit down.

1173
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:12,111
Vanessa.

1174
01:03:12,112 --> 01:03:13,945
This is Kamara
and this is Pierre.

1175
01:03:13,946 --> 01:03:14,906
How you do?

1176
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:18,617
Kamara makes a fortune
painting by numbers and Pierre

1177
01:03:18,618 --> 01:03:19,701
helps them spend it.

1178
01:03:19,702 --> 01:03:21,244
Well, that's one way
of making a living.

1179
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:22,954
What a remarkable young man.

1180
01:03:22,955 --> 01:03:24,623
Where did you
find him, Fontaine?

1181
01:03:24,624 --> 01:03:27,626
Inside a waiter's jacket and
trousers simply bursting to

1182
01:03:27,627 --> 01:03:28,586
explode.

1183
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:30,629
So, I let him out.

1184
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,132
Such an oral
strength and the eyes.

1185
01:03:34,133 --> 01:03:36,134
Put him down
Kamara, he's not yours.

1186
01:03:36,135 --> 01:03:37,844
No, you don't know
where I've been either.

1187
01:03:37,845 --> 01:03:39,596
I could, hazard a guess.

1188
01:03:39,597 --> 01:03:41,848
Then do if hazard
is the key to him.

1189
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:43,809
I wouldn't say
hazard was the key,

1190
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:44,893
Tony no.

1191
01:03:44,894 --> 01:03:46,645
Perhaps you could
tell us who he is.

1192
01:03:46,646 --> 01:03:48,396
Who needs a key?

1193
01:03:48,397 --> 01:03:49,523
I picked the lock.

1194
01:03:49,524 --> 01:03:53,819
And I, and to do this I'd
use either sex or money.

1195
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,987
But suppose there are locks.

1196
01:03:55,988 --> 01:03:57,739
G_od Leonard not
phll0s0phy, please.

1197
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,492
You'll turn the
evening into a fucking bore.

1198
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,786
Well, I like the
things Leonard says.

1199
01:04:02,703 --> 01:04:03,995
Thank you, Tony.

1200
01:04:03,996 --> 01:04:06,081
That makes you his
favorite listener,

1201
01:04:06,082 --> 01:04:06,999
after himself.

1202
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,750
Oh, you English.

1203
01:04:08,751 --> 01:04:12,420
You use your smiles as seals
and your words are swords.

1204
01:04:12,421 --> 01:04:14,214
Oh, how profound.

1205
01:04:14,215 --> 01:04:16,007
Don't you wish you'd
said that Leonard?

1206
01:04:16,008 --> 01:04:18,135
I Will.

1207
01:04:21,305 --> 01:04:23,682
Well, I think I'll go and take
a look around and leave you to

1208
01:04:23,683 --> 01:04:24,642
solve your crossword puzzle.

1209
01:04:24,684 --> 01:04:27,519
Now don't go straying
too far, will you lover?

1210
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,188
I shall go with him, to be
sure that he doesn't darling.

1211
01:04:30,189 --> 01:04:31,190
Good.

1212
01:04:31,399 --> 01:04:34,610
Come Tony, let me show you
the palace of the light.

1213
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:42,117
Don't worry about Kamara,
it's just another of Vanessa's

1214
01:04:42,118 --> 01:04:47,330
parasites, here,
drown your displeasure.

1215
01:04:47,331 --> 01:04:48,583
That's a very good idea.

1216
01:04:54,422 --> 01:04:55,423
Thank you.

1217
01:04:57,133 --> 01:05:00,135
I often wonder what
it is the winters buy.

1218
01:05:00,136 --> 01:05:02,555
One half so precious
as the goods they sell.

1219
01:05:06,017 --> 01:05:07,059
Drugs, could it be?

1220
01:05:08,144 --> 01:05:13,565
Well, you're not doing
too badly as a writer.

1221
01:05:13,566 --> 01:05:15,317
I wish I learned to
spell a bit better.

1222
01:05:15,318 --> 01:05:16,736
This is not good spelling.

1223
01:05:18,195 --> 01:05:21,281
This is a truce of
a cunning marriage.

1224
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:25,452
I needed someone to support
me in my craft and seminar.

1225
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:27,413
Vanessa needed
someone to support.

1226
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,708
In some ways I'm more of a
tax loss than a husband.

1227
01:05:31,709 --> 01:05:33,336
You're not complaining
though, are you?

1228
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:39,174
Come and see my
little paddling pool.

1229
01:05:39,175 --> 01:05:41,135
But mind the deep end.

1230
01:05:45,514 --> 01:05:46,890
Who are they Leonard?

1231
01:05:46,891 --> 01:05:50,186
I don't know but... they
are nearly always here.

1232
01:05:52,688 --> 01:05:54,814
Women bore me Tony.

1233
01:05:54,815 --> 01:05:55,691
Do they?

1234
01:05:55,692 --> 01:05:59,027
Much as I appreciate
an additional orifice,

1235
01:05:59,028 --> 01:06:00,154
they bore me.

1236
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:06,077
Hey Tony, Tony hold
on, let's go for a swim.

1237
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,413
Not just now, what
about the others?

1238
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:13,542
Oh don't worry about them
they'll be long in a moment,

1239
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:18,589
here.

1240
01:06:27,723 --> 01:06:29,433
I thought they'd never leave.

1241
01:06:29,475 --> 01:06:31,685
Where do you find them, Vanessa?

1242
01:06:31,686 --> 01:06:32,687
Here...

1243
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:45,074
So when do I get
it all together?

1244
01:06:46,325 --> 01:06:49,869
All we have to do is to
press, button number one.

1245
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:53,498
And which button would that be'?

1246
01:06:53,499 --> 01:06:56,751
Well, darling all of
Tony's zones are erogenous.

1247
01:06:56,752 --> 01:07:00,755
You can choose anyone of
them and they are all good.

1248
01:07:00,756 --> 01:07:02,967
Vanessa, get here...

1249
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:07,887
Come on Jess.

1250
01:07:07,888 --> 01:07:09,181
Coming.

1251
01:07:38,919 --> 01:07:40,921
Tony, I have got a
surprise for you.

1252
01:07:43,674 --> 01:07:44,884
Get in there.

1253
01:07:45,843 --> 01:07:47,094
He's wrapping UP-

1254
01:07:48,304 --> 01:07:49,512
You're my Christmas present.

1255
01:07:49,513 --> 01:07:52,390
Don't you want to
see what's inside it?

1256
01:07:52,391 --> 01:07:59,482
Come on, come OH, no come on.

1257
01:08:02,151 --> 01:08:03,611
I'm going to have you.

1258
01:08:04,403 --> 01:08:07,364
Oh Leonard, where
you've been all my life?

1259
01:08:13,412 --> 01:08:15,038
Take me, love it.

1260
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,666
Ready?

1261
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:19,668
Do it.

1262
01:09:55,264 --> 01:09:57,892
Tony, Tony, Tony don't go.

1263
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,733
Tony, come on back.

1264
01:11:10,005 --> 01:11:11,839
What's going on?

1265
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,300
It's an emergency.

1266
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,721
Stop it.

1267
01:11:20,015 --> 01:11:21,558
Your cue.

1268
01:11:36,282 --> 01:11:37,907
That's enough darling.

1269
01:11:37,908 --> 01:11:39,409
Where's your husband then?

1270
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:40,703
He's in Geneva.

1271
01:11:41,912 --> 01:11:43,746
What's he doing there?

1272
01:11:43,747 --> 01:11:45,249
He's meeting his daughter.

1273
01:11:48,252 --> 01:11:50,670
I'm supposed to be
working in his club.

1274
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:52,005
It's my club.

1275
01:11:52,006 --> 01:11:55,800
"I can take a loss for an
hour and you're supposed to be

1276
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:57,594
looking after me.

1277
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,151
Ricardo residence.

1278
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:16,946
Ricardo, wake him
if you have to.

1279
01:12:16,947 --> 01:12:18,490
It is in the middle
of the night, Sir.

1280
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:21,492
Benjamin Khaled here.

1281
01:12:21,493 --> 01:12:25,538
Well Mr. Khaled, I'm sorry
Mr. Ricardo is not here,

1282
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:26,457
he won't be back until...

1283
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:28,876
I want him in my office
tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.

1284
01:12:33,297 --> 01:12:34,298
9 o'clock.

1285
01:12:42,222 --> 01:12:43,223
Bon Jour.

1286
01:12:46,352 --> 01:12:49,021
Oh my God, what a dump.

1287
01:12:52,983 --> 01:12:54,734
Did I wake you?

1288
01:12:54,735 --> 01:12:55,736
Yeah.

1289
01:12:56,987 --> 01:12:59,113
Wasn't last night fun?

1290
01:12:59,114 --> 01:13:01,158
All that fun, you can keep it.

1291
01:13:02,242 --> 01:13:04,327
Nobody had a gun to
your head my pet.

1292
01:13:04,328 --> 01:13:04,995
You know what I mean.

1293
01:13:04,996 --> 01:13:07,330
I don't like being
put in that position.

1294
01:13:07,331 --> 01:13:09,123
And which position was that?

1295
01:13:09,124 --> 01:13:10,917
You were in so many.

1296
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:13,337
I'm talking about those
nutters you call friends.

1297
01:13:14,421 --> 01:13:16,089
I hope you're not
reverting to type,

1298
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:16,840
Tony.

1299
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:19,926
I thought I've trained all of
that working class taboo out

1300
01:13:19,927 --> 01:13:20,636
of you.

1301
01:13:20,637 --> 01:13:24,890
Well, you haven't.

1302
01:13:26,308 --> 01:13:27,767
So it appears.

1303
01:13:27,768 --> 01:13:31,396
Vanessa was disappointed in
your performance too or rather

1304
01:13:31,397 --> 01:13:34,023
than the lack of it,
especially after the rave

1305
01:13:34,024 --> 01:13:35,441
reviews I gave you.

1306
01:13:35,442 --> 01:13:37,945
You mean you already had
that lot worked out between.

1307
01:13:41,323 --> 01:13:45,076
You cow, don't you
ever do that to me again,

1308
01:13:45,077 --> 01:13:46,078
ever.

1309
01:13:47,246 --> 01:13:49,080
I wouldn't dream of it.

1310
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:50,915
As a matter of fact, I
think it's time that I started

1311
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:54,252
looking for something
a bit more up market.

1312
01:13:54,253 --> 01:13:55,753
All right, all
right so I'm dismissed,

1313
01:13:55,754 --> 01:13:56,839
how do I get back home?

1314
01:13:58,006 --> 01:14:00,383
Fuck yourself there darling.

1315
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:01,802
You could do with
a little practice.

1316
01:15:45,531 --> 01:15:46,782
Holy shit.

1317
01:15:55,999 --> 01:15:57,959
Ah, you must be Tony.

1318
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,460
Yes, Mrs. Khaled, right?

1319
01:15:59,461 --> 01:16:01,170
Ah yes.

1320
01:16:01,171 --> 01:16:02,755
But do come along.

1321
01:16:02,756 --> 01:16:05,591
Alex said you'd be arriving
but I'm afraid she's out for

1322
01:16:05,592 --> 01:16:06,593
the moment.

1323
01:16:07,803 --> 01:16:09,596
Nice little place you got here.

1324
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:14,308
Yes, well, we like it.

1325
01:16:14,309 --> 01:16:16,352
Now, Staton will show
you to a room and then,

1326
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:17,728
perhaps you'd like a drink.

1327
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:19,398
Fine, yeah, fine.

1328
01:16:35,497 --> 01:16:36,248
Who's that'?

1329
01:16:36,249 --> 01:16:38,916
Tony Blake.

1330
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:40,793
Your gin and tonic madam.

1331
01:16:40,794 --> 01:16:41,961
Thank you.

1332
01:16:41,962 --> 01:16:43,421
Scotch and soda sir.

1333
01:16:43,422 --> 01:16:44,423
Oh yeah, thank you.

1334
01:16:46,216 --> 01:16:47,217
Quite up here...

1335
01:16:48,135 --> 01:16:49,510
Would you like a drink sir?

1336
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:50,845
Yeah, whiskey and coke please.

1337
01:16:50,846 --> 01:16:51,722
Coke sir?

1338
01:16:51,723 --> 01:16:52,847
Yes, cola.

1339
01:16:52,848 --> 01:16:54,974
That's a strange
drink young man.

1340
01:16:54,975 --> 01:16:56,392
With the whiskey sir?

1341
01:16:56,393 --> 01:16:58,561
Yes, I know its awful
shame to waste perfectly good

1342
01:16:58,562 --> 01:16:59,645
Coca-Cola.

1343
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:01,565
Yes, quite certain.

1344
01:17:07,863 --> 01:17:10,364
Well, as I was saying, I'm
just down the road next to

1345
01:17:10,365 --> 01:17:11,241
Mrs. Haley Scott.

1346
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:12,117
Do you know her?

1347
01:17:12,118 --> 01:17:13,200
No, don't know her.

1348
01:17:13,201 --> 01:17:16,120
Yes, well, her husband
died about three years ago.

1349
01:17:16,121 --> 01:17:17,705
They used to keep race horses.

1350
01:17:17,706 --> 01:17:18,915
Comme un cheval.

1351
01:17:33,722 --> 01:17:34,723
Thanks darling.

1352
01:17:35,432 --> 01:17:36,433
Oh well.

1353
01:17:38,602 --> 01:17:40,353
Very nice, did you
make them yourself,

1354
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:41,355
don't you?

1355
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:42,981
Sit there.

1356
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:49,071
Next to you.

1357
01:17:57,913 --> 01:17:58,413
Thank to you.

1358
01:17:58,414 --> 01:17:59,623
That's right.

1359
01:18:11,009 --> 01:18:12,052
What are you doing here?

1360
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:18,016
No, not here.

1361
01:18:20,143 --> 01:18:22,604
Okay, we'll just talk.

1362
01:18:23,146 --> 01:18:24,147
Not now.

1363
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:27,191
What's going on Alex'?

1364
01:18:27,192 --> 01:18:28,110
Going on?

1365
01:18:28,111 --> 01:18:29,528
I can't get near you.

1366
01:18:31,321 --> 01:18:32,197
Really, I...

1367
01:18:32,198 --> 01:18:34,907
Look, I came here for you
and not this country bullshit,

1368
01:18:34,908 --> 01:18:35,909
you understand.

1369
01:18:45,001 --> 01:18:46,919
Christ, Alex, I'm sorry.

1370
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,004
I just never felt like
this about a chick before and

1371
01:18:49,005 --> 01:18:49,673
that's all.

1372
01:18:49,674 --> 01:18:51,048
A chick'?

1373
01:18:51,049 --> 01:18:52,508
Get out of my room.

1374
01:18:52,509 --> 01:18:55,177
Get back in your nasty little
car and take your stupid words

1375
01:18:55,178 --> 01:18:56,345
back where you belong.

1376
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:57,430
Go on, get out.

1377
01:18:57,431 --> 01:18:59,099
For Christ Alex, what did I do?

1378
01:18:59,141 --> 01:19:00,100
What did you do?

1379
01:19:00,142 --> 01:19:02,393
You think I don't know about
you and that cheap slut who

1380
01:19:02,394 --> 01:19:03,270
owns you.

1381
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:04,895
You think you can break my
father's heart between the

1382
01:19:04,896 --> 01:19:07,189
rotten pair of you and expect
me to love you on a one night

1383
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:08,191
stand?

1384
01:19:09,985 --> 01:19:12,111
Listen Alex, Fontaine,
she's nothing to me.

1385
01:19:12,112 --> 01:19:13,071
Go and tell her then.

1386
01:19:13,072 --> 01:19:14,113
Go and tell the bitch.

1387
01:19:14,114 --> 01:19:16,241
Tell her I sent you back
again as a Christmas present.

1388
01:19:19,828 --> 01:19:21,537
You're just about
what she deserves.

1389
01:19:21,538 --> 01:19:23,581
A cheap gigolo in a
little night club,

1390
01:19:23,582 --> 01:19:25,417
a visit when she feels like it.

1391
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:28,586
Go on, get out.

1392
01:19:28,587 --> 01:19:31,047
Get back to your chicks
and your stupid friends.

1393
01:19:32,424 --> 01:19:33,841
You're pathetic.

1394
01:19:33,842 --> 01:19:36,719
Did you think I'd fall for
the irresistible Tony like the

1395
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,720
rest of them?

1396
01:19:37,721 --> 01:19:38,888
Is that what you thought?

1397
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:39,890
Is it?

1398
01:20:17,427 --> 01:20:18,428
Come on.

1399
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,131
I'm home.

1400
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,592
Where's everybody?

1401
01:20:59,427 --> 01:21:00,553
Who are you?

1402
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:01,555
Where's my husband?

1403
01:21:02,973 --> 01:21:04,515
Who the hell are you?

1404
01:21:04,516 --> 01:21:06,767
My name is Rupert
Scott, Mrs. Khaled.

1405
01:21:06,768 --> 01:21:09,812
I work for your
husband in a legal capacity.

1406
01:21:09,813 --> 01:21:11,273
He asked me to give you this.

1407
01:21:14,901 --> 01:21:17,111
Your husband has instructed me
to inform you that he's taking

1408
01:21:17,112 --> 01:21:19,280
divorce proceedings against
you at the earliest possible

1409
01:21:19,281 --> 01:21:20,781
opportunity in the New Year.

1410
01:21:20,782 --> 01:21:22,992
Also that your clothes and
effects have been removed from

1411
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:25,452
this property and placed for
your convenience in a suite at

1412
01:21:25,453 --> 01:21:29,081
the Connel hotel all
reasonable care was taken.

1413
01:21:29,082 --> 01:21:30,708
Further that as
from midnight tonight,

1414
01:21:30,709 --> 01:21:33,043
this property reverts to the
holding company and all the

1415
01:21:33,044 --> 01:21:35,379
keys and locks will
therefore be changed.

1416
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:38,465
A notice has also been
promulgated to the effect that

1417
01:21:38,466 --> 01:21:41,051
your husband is no longer
responsible for any debts

1418
01:21:41,052 --> 01:21:42,554
incurred by you in his name.

1419
01:21:43,638 --> 01:21:44,973
My God.

1420
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:50,060
Is there anything
you'd, you'd wish to ask me,

1421
01:21:50,061 --> 01:21:51,062
Mrs. Khaled'?

1422
01:21:52,314 --> 01:21:56,317
You, no.

1423
01:21:56,318 --> 01:21:57,985
Very well then.

1424
01:21:57,986 --> 01:21:59,237
I'll bid you goodnight.

1425
01:22:02,991 --> 01:22:05,534
Oh, by the way Merry Christmas,

1426
01:22:05,535 --> 01:22:06,620
Mrs. Khaled.

1427
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,625
Mr. Thane is not
in at the moment.

1428
01:22:54,626 --> 01:22:58,213
If you wish to leave a message
please speak after the tone.

1429
01:23:00,715 --> 01:23:02,049
Merry Christmas here my lad.

1430
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:04,551
Its Tony Blake here, sorry
I couldn't get you before

1431
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:06,011
Christmas but you
know how it is.

1432
01:23:06,012 --> 01:23:07,888
Give us a call will
you, you got the numbers.

1433
01:23:07,889 --> 01:23:10,058
Don't forget about
our little deal.

1434
01:23:16,189 --> 01:23:24,189
Hark the herald angels
sing Glory to the newborn King

1435
01:23:24,739 --> 01:23:32,739
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

1436
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,042
Hello.

1437
01:23:37,043 --> 01:23:37,794
Yes?

1438
01:23:37,795 --> 01:23:41,630
It's, its Tony Blake
here, Mrs. Khaled?

1439
01:23:41,631 --> 01:23:42,798
Yes, it's I.

1440
01:23:42,799 --> 01:23:44,758
Yes, we did meet briefly.

1441
01:23:44,759 --> 01:23:45,760
That's right.

1442
01:23:47,345 --> 01:23:49,430
I was wondering if I
could speak to Alexandra,

1443
01:23:49,431 --> 01:23:50,431
please.

1444
01:23:50,432 --> 01:23:52,182
Well, I'm afraid
she's out at the moment,

1445
01:23:52,183 --> 01:23:53,350
Tony.

1446
01:23:53,351 --> 01:23:54,477
Can I get her to ring you?

1447
01:23:56,646 --> 01:23:57,646
Yes please.

1448
01:23:57,647 --> 01:23:59,940
Does she know your number.

1449
01:23:59,941 --> 01:24:00,942
Yes.

1450
01:24:02,986 --> 01:24:06,321
Well, goodbye then.

1451
01:24:06,322 --> 01:24:07,657
Bye-bye and Merry Christmas.

1452
01:24:08,992 --> 01:24:09,993
Merry Christmas.

1453
01:24:16,624 --> 01:24:17,791
What was that?

1454
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,376
Oh, it is nothing important.

1455
01:24:19,377 --> 01:24:22,880
Friends, this is one
of the happiest moments

1456
01:24:22,881 --> 01:24:23,840
of my life.

1457
01:24:23,841 --> 01:24:25,842
I propose a toast to
my daughter, Alex.

1458
01:24:27,844 --> 01:24:28,887
2p, love.

1459
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:41,691
Goodbye darling.

1460
01:25:05,006 --> 01:25:06,007
Mr. Thane is not in.

1461
01:25:32,242 --> 01:25:33,243
Sammy Marks.

1462
01:25:34,911 --> 01:25:41,500
Hello, Sammy, it's Tony.

1463
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:42,626
How are you?

1464
01:25:42,627 --> 01:25:44,086
I heard you were dead and
doing the club circuit up

1465
01:25:44,087 --> 01:25:45,254
north is that true?

1466
01:25:45,255 --> 01:25:47,256
No, that's an ugly rumor.

1467
01:25:47,257 --> 01:25:50,509
I'm alive and well,
living in South America.

1468
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:51,677
Pick the right
time of year for it,

1469
01:25:51,678 --> 01:25:53,053
didn't you?

1470
01:25:53,054 --> 01:25:54,304
What are you doing down here?

1471
01:25:54,305 --> 01:25:56,015
Well, Christmas
with my mom and dad,

1472
01:25:56,057 --> 01:25:58,350
who may or may not be alive,
you can't tell till you switch

1473
01:25:58,351 --> 01:26:00,103
the box off, then
you hear them snoring.

1474
01:26:02,105 --> 01:26:04,648
Well, I was supposed to be
tucked up with Alex but...

1475
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:05,774
I don't know.

1476
01:26:05,775 --> 01:26:07,359
Not that mother
and daughter act.

1477
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,361
No way.

1478
01:26:09,237 --> 01:26:11,738
I had enough with that
lunatic woman in Paris.

1479
01:26:11,739 --> 01:26:12,990
Did she have enough of you?

1480
01:26:12,991 --> 01:26:15,535
Yeah, her and her mate.

1481
01:26:17,328 --> 01:26:21,290
I got to get out of that one
Sammy and I thought if I could

1482
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:22,417
just talk to Alex.

1483
01:26:24,836 --> 01:26:27,254
You are thick my
old fruit ain't you.

1484
01:26:27,255 --> 01:26:30,132
I mean, I love you
but you are thick.

1485
01:26:30,133 --> 01:26:31,133
Thanks.

1486
01:26:31,134 --> 01:26:34,469
Listen my son, there's two
sorts of ladies in this world.

1487
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:36,723
The first sort will
pick you up and screw you,

1488
01:26:36,764 --> 01:26:39,016
second sort will pick your
brains and screw you up.

1489
01:26:39,017 --> 01:26:41,226
Your Alex belongs to the
latter half as far as you're

1490
01:26:41,227 --> 01:26:42,145
concerned.

1491
01:26:42,146 --> 01:26:44,062
You're not from the
same planet you two,

1492
01:26:44,063 --> 01:26:46,648
I mean, she might fancy
you or she might not.

1493
01:26:46,649 --> 01:26:49,401
When it comes to any
kind of permanent fixture,

1494
01:26:49,402 --> 01:26:51,904
you've got all your assets and
eligibility of a piece of very

1495
01:26:51,905 --> 01:26:52,906
rough trade.

1496
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:55,408
I'm not hurting
your feelings, am I?

1497
01:26:56,659 --> 01:26:58,328
I don't believe you, Sammy.

1498
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:02,623
All right, so my name is not
hopely stopley and I didn't

1499
01:27:02,624 --> 01:27:05,083
make head boy at Gordonstoun
but I can still handle myself

1500
01:27:05,084 --> 01:27:08,337
can't I, but if I couldn't
that club wouldn't be nothing

1501
01:27:08,338 --> 01:27:10,923
without me for a start and
it's not going to end there

1502
01:27:10,924 --> 01:27:12,342
either, not by a long way.

1503
01:27:13,551 --> 01:27:15,844
They're going to be eating off
of my tables for very shortly,

1504
01:27:15,845 --> 01:27:16,512
you'll see.

1505
01:27:16,513 --> 01:27:18,513
Oh yeah, yes.

1506
01:27:18,514 --> 01:27:19,973
Yes, if Thane came through.

1507
01:27:19,974 --> 01:27:21,350
Yeah, firm?

1508
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:23,185
The contract has been drawn.

1509
01:27:23,186 --> 01:27:24,728
Oh, not firm.

1510
01:27:24,729 --> 01:27:27,231
A verbal agreement worth
exactly the paper it's

1511
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,066
written on.

1512
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:31,360
Listen Tony, with a
schmuck like Thane,

1513
01:27:31,361 --> 01:27:33,737
you don't believe till the
money is in the bank and then

1514
01:27:33,738 --> 01:27:35,656
checked by experts to make
sure the Queen's picture ain't

1515
01:27:35,657 --> 01:27:37,532
winking at you.

1516
01:27:37,533 --> 01:27:39,201
Thane is the
serpent in the garden,

1517
01:27:39,202 --> 01:27:40,203
my son.

1518
01:27:40,411 --> 01:27:41,246
I'm not worried.

1519
01:27:41,247 --> 01:27:45,290
Yeah, that's what
I like about you.

1520
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,918
Come on, let me buy you a
drink for the New Year,

1521
01:27:47,919 --> 01:27:49,336
you're going to need it.

1522
01:27:49,337 --> 01:27:51,673
You don't often meet a
winner who loses like you.

1523
01:28:32,839 --> 01:28:38,594
Let's go disco Let's go disco

1524
01:29:30,688 --> 01:29:31,980
Having fun, Tony?

1525
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:33,398
Don't know whether you know
but Alex and I are engaged,

1526
01:29:33,399 --> 01:29:34,900
getting married in
the spring probably.

1527
01:29:34,901 --> 01:29:36,068
Don't you think
it is a good idea,

1528
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:37,861
but we thought we'd hold
our engagement party here?

1529
01:29:37,862 --> 01:29:39,821
Yes, I know it's a bit
of a delicate subject,

1530
01:29:39,822 --> 01:29:40,823
see you later old chap.

1531
01:29:42,492 --> 01:29:44,576
EXCUSE me, GXCUSG me.

1532
01:29:44,577 --> 01:29:45,912
Have you seen Madeline?

1533
01:29:47,997 --> 01:29:48,998
Are you all right?

1534
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,959
Here, where you
been all my life?

1535
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,212
I tell you what,
play your cards right,

1536
01:29:55,213 --> 01:29:56,589
you could have me tonight.

1537
01:29:57,673 --> 01:29:59,926
Ooh amazing lips, amazing.

1538
01:30:06,724 --> 01:30:12,854
Let's go disco Let's go disco

1539
01:30:12,855 --> 01:30:20,855
The night is
still young Let the DJ play

1540
01:30:21,322 --> 01:30:24,991
your song Let's go disco

1541
01:30:24,992 --> 01:30:26,327
Tony, give us a kiss.

1542
01:30:35,002 --> 01:30:38,380
Tony, you're looking very well.

1543
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:40,007
You know Ian of course.

1544
01:30:41,008 --> 01:30:42,009
We've met.

1545
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:46,806
Perhaps next time
you'll be a little wiser.

1546
01:30:46,848 --> 01:30:49,141
As a matter of fact, you
saved me some problems.

1547
01:30:49,142 --> 01:30:52,936
Ben wants to sell and Ian
has offered to buy his share.

1548
01:30:52,937 --> 01:30:55,730
Since you're going to go
into business for yourself,

1549
01:30:55,731 --> 01:31:00,278
all I need to do is to find a
new manager for this place and

1550
01:31:04,073 --> 01:31:05,907
don't be here
tomorrow will you, Tony?

1551
01:31:05,908 --> 01:31:07,326
There's a good boy.

1552
01:31:48,743 --> 01:31:50,161
Is life beautiful man.

1553
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:53,706
Ain't it beautiful?

1554
01:32:11,974 --> 01:32:13,434
Five minutes everybody.

1555
01:32:18,272 --> 01:32:20,483
Hello Charlie, how are you?

1556
01:32:25,655 --> 01:32:30,116
You bastard, you
cock sucking bastard.

1557
01:32:30,117 --> 01:32:32,786
You and that whore stab me
in the fucking back with your

1558
01:32:32,787 --> 01:32:33,787
bloody night club punks.

1559
01:32:33,788 --> 01:32:35,872
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm
fucking finished with you and

1560
01:32:35,873 --> 01:32:37,499
this bloody dump...

1561
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,834
You are a filthy runt.

1562
01:32:42,922 --> 01:32:43,923
Here we go.

1563
01:32:52,098 --> 01:32:53,182
Get him out of here.

1564
01:32:55,685 --> 01:32:56,769
Come on you.

1565
01:33:03,442 --> 01:33:04,443
Get up.

1566
01:33:06,862 --> 01:33:07,863
Tony.

1567
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:11,242
Tony.

1568
01:33:11,826 --> 01:33:12,827
Come here.

1569
01:33:30,886 --> 01:33:31,929
Give us a call champ,

1570
01:33:34,015 --> 01:33:35,016
anytime.

1571
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:42,731
Nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three

1572
01:33:42,732 --> 01:33:44,733
Mr. Blake, Mr. Blake.

1573
01:33:44,734 --> 01:33:48,988
Two, one, Happy New Year.
