1
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,126
Man in the fucking water.

2
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:15,876
Shit. Stick to their own fucking side, man.

3
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,584
Cheeky fucking midgets.

4
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:23,709
Oi. Check your arcs, Rambo.

5
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,334
Mowgli!

6
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:29,709
I'm here trying to bring fucking peace and
love to your shitty stone-age country.

7
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:33,431
Is it too much to be able to enjoy a rinse without
taking indirect fucking fire from you lot?

8
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:48,167
Let that be a lesson to ya.

9
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,876
Go on, fuck off now then.

10
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,797
Ever heard the one
about not walking into a room

11
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:57,917
until you know how
you're walking out of there, Tug?

12
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:06,667
We all miss our birds, mucker. No need
to start grooming the local nippers.

13
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,334
Fuck off.

14
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:10,501
Grenade fishing -
nearly catch of the fucking day, me.

15
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,792
Hey, no harm done.

16
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,917
TWO, yeah?

17
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,084
First lesson my grandma taught me, Tug.
Don't pick a fight with an armed midget.

18
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:40,709
We're a long way from home.

19
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:42,709
What you talking about,
you're from Huddersfield.

20
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,792
- Go on, mate.
- Cheers.

21
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,084
Race you back up?

22
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,667
You're fully loaded, mate.
Unfair fight.

23
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,376
OK, go! Now!

24
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,792
- Signals?
- Yeah, mate. Cheers.

25
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,876
Come on then, what's the news?
Heard there was a heatwave back home.

26
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:18,501
- Typical, innit?
- Heatwave? Pissed it down, mate.

27
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,084
Anyway, where's the FLET?

28
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:23,751
FLET? Hat!

29
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:26,001
It's all around you, mate.

30
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:29,667
Terry pokes his nose up here.
We smash him back into his hole.

31
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,251
Bosh!

32
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:37,917
- Did you bring it?
- In the back, pal.

33
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,084
My guy tells me something's coming.

34
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:45,709
They got a new field commander.
Keep your eyes open.

35
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,584
Sure, John. Cheers.

36
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,417
- Civvies here?
- Yank security.

37
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,501
They look after the engineers
working on the dam.

38
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,667
Talk about hearts and minds

39
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,109
this joint would supply electricity
to half of bloody Helmand

40
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:59,759
if someone could work
out how to turn it on.

41
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:03,876
- So where have you been?
- Ops room, Bastion. Sangin, then here.

42
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:07,626
- Sangin. Proper tasty, right?
- Telling me.

43
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:12,542
- Is this us?
- Nah. OMLTs.

44
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:15,334
Teaching the ANA which end
of a weapon's the noisy bit.

45
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,334
We're up top, mate.

46
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,542
- So what's it like up here?
- Right, OK, fellas...

47
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:24,126
It's going on, that's what it is, mucker.

48
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:27,626
I quit the reg after Telic:
Zero contacts, mate.

49
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:31,084
I joined back when Herrick was on.
Finally get a piece of the action.

50
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:34,251
Rather be in the scrum than on a
subs bench, do you know what I mean?

51
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,834
Not really.

52
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:40,042
Rugby's a real game, mate.
Taliban should play it. Tough bastards.

53
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,876
I'm pretty sure Afghans don't play rugby.

54
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,042
Here, look, look, look.

55
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,584
- Give us a lift up, pal?
- Hop on, Tug.

56
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,876
- <i>Do one, Presser'.
- Good for you, hat.</i>

57
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,959
Fucking dick swinger.

58
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,417
Hop on, Mark!

59
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,917
- Did they come?
- Dunno, look in here, Spud.

60
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,834
Sergeant McMellon. Signaller Jones.

61
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,959
Shit the fucking bed!

62
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,542
I hope you know how to use a radio
without batteries, Signaller Jones.

63
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:40,167
For fuck's sake.

64
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,834
- Right, welfare box. Who wants it?
- Yeah, I'll have it, Pross.

65
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:44,626
Any decent scoff though, we split it, yeah?

66
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:48,417
Presser, stop twatting about
and get that stuff up there!

67
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:57,001
Fusilier AL Barlow's got his porn re-sup.

68
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,001
Fuck me, Ken, your mum
looks hotter every month.

69
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:02,334
- Yeah, fucking hands off, mate.
- The rest?

70
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:06,167
Mark. Here you go, mate.

71
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,501
Cheers, pal.

72
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,376
- Signals?
- Oman, yeah.

73
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,209
- Jonesy.
- Mark.

74
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:16,292
- How you doing, man?
- Good, mate.

75
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,776
- What the fuck's this? You dicks!
- You been up here before?

76
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,592
No, first time.

77
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,934
- Aye, ar, mortar boys, you can have that one.
- Jay, you wanna show him around, mate.

78
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,584
Well, we know where your basha is, Barlow.
Keep an eye open, that's all I'm saying, mate.

79
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,959
Look.

80
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,417
Luke, boat came in, mate.

81
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,792
Skin 'em up will you.

82
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:37,834
- Prosser, catch you up there, pal.
- Yeah, man.

83
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,292
Fuck it. Ten quid. Thanks Aunt Pam,
just what I fucking need out here.

84
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,917
New TACSAT's come in, Spud. I'll set it up.

85
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,417
This is Athens.
You've got three-sixty all-round defence.

86
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,584
Down here you've got the GPMG fifty cal.

87
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:12,584
Clackers for the claymores.
In here's the interpreter's place.

88
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,751
That's water, ablutions. You got
burn pit, shit pit down beyond that.

89
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,292
Right, this needs to go over
with the other stuff.

90
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,209
Ken.

91
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,959
Oh for fuck's sake, Spud,
I did it yesterday.

92
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:24,959
Thank you, Ken.

93
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,792
<i>Thank you, Presser.</i>

94
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:29,709
- Come on, lads...
- You're in here with the medic and the med store.

95
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,751
- HQ, mortar pit.
- Go on then, fucking sign 'em out

96
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,834
There's about sixteen odd here at Athens.

97
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:40,209
Seven, eight, up at Normandy.
That's it. Stay on marked tracks. Enjoy.

98
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,751
Well, the clinical term is dick rot.

99
00:08:56,584 --> 00:09:00,001
- Was it anyone nice?
- Four, actually. All delightful.

100
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:00,792
Bastard.

101
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:04,209
Right, put it away. You gotta be
careful flashing it about this lot.

102
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,751
What is it? Long time on the hill.

103
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:13,792
Gungy mortars? The rumours are true, pal.
Not that they'd go near that rancid thing.

104
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:15,334
Oh, yeah.

105
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:18,126
<i>From Nog German.</i>

106
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,084
Happy birthday.

107
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:24,234
He says make sure you save 'em
till the big day. When's that?

108
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,801
Seventh. Why, what are we now?

109
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,667
Unlucky, pal. Fifth.

110
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:32,584
Fuck that. I'm not waiting
two fucking days.

111
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,667
You taking heat up here?

112
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,626
Nah, I get more contact
when my bird's on the rag.

113
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:47,167
I mean it were busy for a bit but
Terry's pissed off back to Sangin.

114
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:51,001
We own all this high ground.
Out of small arms range.

115
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:55,167
A few Chinese rockets, bit of boom
boom in the valley, but that's it.

116
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,792
Lucky cos we're out of ammo.

117
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,084
<i>Nah, boredom or ANN“ get you
before Terry does.</i>

118
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,251
- Right. Jonesy, yeah?
- Yeah.

119
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,709
Antibiotics, anti-inflammatories.
Take one of each before each meal.

120
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,042
Run the course.

121
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,876
Give the pin dick a bit of R and R, yeah?

122
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:33,084
BURPS

123
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:44,792
Stop staring at my arse, you throbber.

124
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,167
What's the fucking hurry, hat?

125
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:55,167
Aye up, lads,
budgie express inbound.

126
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:58,042
Wind direction please, Private Harvey.

127
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,566
- I do know this guy, right?
- Out of the west, Private Smith.

128
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:01,466
Yeah.

129
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,959
OK, I'm...

130
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:10,042
I'm dead. I'm a man.
I'm British. I've got a gay beard.

131
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:11,292
We think.

132
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:17,001
We think. I killed a king
and I'm not Guy Fawkes.

133
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,292
Who didn't kill anyone.

134
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,126
- For fuck's sake, Stu mate.
- Fucker!

135
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,371
It's like watching a retard
trying to fuck a doorknob.

136
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,917
I thought you knew your fucking history.

137
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:32,417
Just fucking guess, will you,
before I slit my fucking wrists.

138
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,667
- Am I anything to do with King Arthur?
- No.

139
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,376
You got three guesses and then
it's five bines for mush.

140
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:41,167
- This is a fucking stitch-up.
- Hey, rules is rules. Right, Stu?

141
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:44,209
<i>When you're wounded and
left on Afghanistan's plains</i>

142

<i>and the Women come out
to cut up What remains</i>

143
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,459

145
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,626
For fuck's sake.

146
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,667
What you doing putting
this shit in your fucking head?

147
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:59,042
Well, it's a bit of perspective, innit?

148
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,459
Perspective on what?

149
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,001
What a dour-faced bastard
Rudyard Kipling was?

150
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,209
You fucking pricks.

151
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:09,751
It's Quasimodo and Wurzel Gummidge.

152
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,209
- It's alright...
- What happened, Ken?

153
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,709
You can get your own
fucking shit tomorrow, OK?

154
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,001

285
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:15,001
There's a possible firing position,
ridge to the south. Brings 'em in range.

286
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,292
Dunno, there's a lot of
deep ground out there.

287

Cannae see any ground sign.

288
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,626
Could take the goat track down.

289
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,209

Aye.

416
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:52,834
All I heard was
'Oh my leg! My fucking leg.'

417
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:56,251
I thought to myself,
here I know that big poofy voice.

418
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:00,084
You reckon I'll still be alright

Course you will, buddy, alright.
You're gonna be fine.

420
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,209
I was fucking joking, mate.

00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:18,251
Just sit tight, alright?

Hey. You alright, yeah?

Maybe we can carry him up?

424
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,834
I don't know, mate.
We need to keep him level.

425
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,626

What's happening?

431
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:58,167
Stu Hale went on a patrol.
Think he trod on a mine.

432
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,167
Where?

433
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:02,292
Down the wadi. Stu Pearson
took Smudge to check him out.

434
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,834
There's no comms on the ground.

435
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,376
What's that?

436
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:16,709
'I. Am. Gay.'
Jar Head, mate, now's not the time.

437
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,376
Oi, Smudger.

- Yeah, it's alright. It's still there, still tiny.

439
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,417
Give us a fag, would you.

440
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,751
Watch your step, mate. There's mines.

441
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,501
I've got a med kit.

442
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,542
Oi, follow our line in, mush.

443

- How you doing?
- Yeah, no fucking drama, mate.

447
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:06,292
It's still bleeding.
I got another tourniquet.

448
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:08,917
- Hold on, Stu, yeah.
- Hold on, mate.

449
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:11,319

00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:03,292
Right, I'm Kilo Five Alpha. Kilo Five Bravo,
in the wadi. Normandy stays Kilo Two.

464
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:05,459
- Alright, let's go, come on.
- Yeah.

465
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:09,949
You're doing brilliant, buddy. You're doing
absolutely fucking brilliant, alright?

466
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:13,709
Keep the leg still, yeah?

467
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:16,001
Any of youse know how to cannulate?

468
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:27,542
- Glad you could join us, Tug.
- I'm faster downhill.

469
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,084
Fucking...

470
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,501
Follow the line in, Mark.

471
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,084
Dressing to the knee.

472
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:40,459
Tug. Tug, I'm out of dressings, mate.

473
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:43,834
- Grab a stretcher, buddy.
- There's still dripping on the stump here, mate.

474
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:44,709
OK, everybody.

475
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:46,871
- Nothing left, mate, at all.
- Shut the fuck up, now!

476
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:48,354
Jar Head, get them buttons done.

477
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,334
Tell me what's going on, pal.

478
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,376
Alright, right leg as you see it, mate

479
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:55,751
- Right hand.
- Yeah.

480
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,167
- Damage to left leg.
- Yeah.

481
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:59,459
Says his right knee's giving him jip, too.

482
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,459
I've strapped it off,
given him a pen of morphine, marked it up.

483
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,876
- I'm fucking shit out of med kit now, mate.
- Right, Jay?

484
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:07,797
- SITREP, mate.
- I applied a second tourniquet.

485
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:10,644
- I've wrapped it up...
- We've got deep ground all round, buddy.

486
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:14,917
I've got the OP keeping an eye on us,
but we don't want to get taken by surprise.

487
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,292
Alright. Nicely done, lads.

488
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:23,334
- Further mine threat?
- Fuck knows. We need to assume there is.

489
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,709
- Extraction?
- I've asked for a winch.

490
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,501
Good job.

491
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:31,834
Right lads, listen in.

492
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,326
We've a bloke on his arse
so let's make him comfortable.

493
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,917
Smudge, get some cover on him, mate.

494
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:38,626
Luke join Foreman on stag.

495
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:39,626
Kenny, you mucker

496
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,542
mark the safe route in,
clear the area around Stu.

497
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:47,084
Check your immediate space, fellas.
Stand only on proven safe route.

498
00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:50,484
- Jonesy get on Athens, check on cas evac.
- Right, Stuart...

499
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:52,509
Stick your ball...
ball your hand on my fist, yeah?

500
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:53,368
Dave.

501
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:56,251
Nobody else in or out without
my say so, buddy, alright?

502
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,542
What's our call sign?

503
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:01,876
Kilo Two Bravo, mate.

504
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:04,678
- But you won't get any response from that one.
- Just fucking try it!

505
00:38:04,703 --> 00:38:07,161
Hello Kilo Five, this is Kilo Two.
Bravo, over.

506
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:13,334
Hello Kilo Five, this is Kilo Two Bravo.
Radio check, over.

507
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,792
Always get the crap jobs, Ken.

508
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,334
Down the wadi. Follow the goat track.

509
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:30,334
We got comms.

510
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,376
Hey, radio check when you're in.

511
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:39,577
Alright lads, this isn't working, we need to get that
bergen underneath his knee, keep it elevated, yeah.

512
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:40,810
- Smudge?
- Cool.

513
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:43,414
Let's get this med pack
underneath his head, Jarhead.

514
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:46,959
- Yeah, just watch his spine, pal.
- Cheers.

515
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,626
Tanning tips for redheads?

516
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:51,167
Woah, Woah, Woah, woah wait.

517
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:53,626
I think I found something.

518
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:09,459
No, it's just a rock.

519
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:11,251
Jesus, Ken.

520
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:12,601
- Hey, hey...
- I'm sorry lads, I'm sorry.

521
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:15,306
Come on, listen. It's important
that we clear the rocks out as well.

522
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:18,451
You know, in case we want to come down
and plant some fucking cabbages one day.

523
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:22,834
Right, Stu. Looks like you might
have a break above the knee.

524
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:26,792
Nothing I can do now, but I've given you
another stick of morphine, yeah?

525
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:29,917
I know it chafes
but you're not dying today, yeah.

526
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:32,459
You're a strong fucker,
you're gonna be alright.

527
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:34,584
Onto the fucking paperwork.

528
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,959
- Oi, Tug.
- Yes, mate.

529
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:44,126
Give us a fag, would you mate?

530
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,084
Mate, just one fucking bine.

531
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:50,292
What's it gonna do?
Blow my other fucking leg off?

532
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:01,626
You fucking legend, mate.

533
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,626
I won't tell on you
if you don't tell on me.

534
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:10,084
Stable down here, Mark.
How we doing on cas evac?

535
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:18,917
Nobody else in, mate.

536
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,917
I've got comms from Normandy.

537
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:24,501
The medic can come in,
Dave, no one else.

538
00:40:24,876 --> 00:40:25,667
Be my guest.

539
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:34,417
Marked route, pal.

540
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,917
You're Kilo Five Bravo

541
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:42,542
Spud's Kilo Five Alpha
and Normandy's Kilo Two.

542
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:43,542
Cheers, pal.

543
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:45,584
Alex, how are you for fluids, pal?

544
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,501
Hello Kilo Five Alpha,
this is Kilo Five Bravo, Over.

545
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:51,792
Kilo Five Alpha,
what's the status on casualty, over.

546
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:53,292
Corporal Hale is P one.

547
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,917
Stable but needs immediate evac, Spud.

548
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:58,834
Can casualty be moved
to Normandy for evac? Over.

549
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:03,167
- Wait out. Medics, can we carry him out?
- Well, he's stable when he's flat.

550
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,601
At an angle there's a chance
he could bleed out or bleed in.

551
00:41:05,626 --> 00:41:07,434
- We need a winch, pal.
- That's what I've been saying.

552
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:08,459
We've got a stretcher.

553
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,559
We should have enough
bodies to keep him level.

554
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:13,851
- Have you seen how fucking steep it is?
- Just cut the corner, go up the re-entrant.

555
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:15,116
No way are we leaving the path.

556
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,741
I'm saying stick tight, wait here
for the heli. That's my opinion.

557
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,667
Mark, what you thinking?

558
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,776
We need to pull him away from the rocks.
Get him in the open.

559
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:31,792
There, the raised bank.

560
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:38,459
Alright.

561
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,334
Right lads, listen up.

562
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:44,029
- I need two bodies to help clear a route over there.
- Kilo Five Alpha, send, over.

563
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,542
Kilo Five Bravo, preparing to move.

564
00:41:45,584 --> 00:41:46,834
Tidy, step in.

565
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:49,542
I want youse on your belt buckles,
shoulder to shoulder.

566
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,542
I'm gonna follow youse with the flags.

567
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:52,667
Roger. Wait out.

568
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:55,667
Come on, lads, let's fucking move.

569
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:05,626
You're seeing this?

570
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:19,084
Kilo Two to Kilo Five Alpha.
Taliban movement on the six one one.

571
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:20,792
Might be headed your way.

572
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:22,917
Roger Kilo Two, keep your eyes on it.

573
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:28,417
Kilo Five Alpha to all call signs. Be advised,
enemy movement in the vicinity of Tangi.

574
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:31,709
Possible threat to Kilo Five
Bravo position. Wait out.

575
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:57,792
I might as well be prodding
a fucking car park.

576
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,667
At least if it's this hard they won't
detonate if you walk over 'em.

577
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,626
I don't think that's how it work.

578
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,542
One here, boss.

579
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:21,459
Just mark it buddy and then deviate.

580
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:31,584
- So I killed lots of people but I'm not a soldier?
- Correct.

581
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:35,667
- Killed myself?
- Yeah. Hanged yourself, I think.

582
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:40,459
What am I some kind of
fucking serial killer or something?

583
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:44,584
- Correct.
- Fucking prick.

584
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:53,001
Oi, same again barman, yeah?

585
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,751
How many's he had now?

586
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:01,126
That's his third.

587
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:10,209
Stu?

588
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:11,851
You got a bleed on
on the left leg, mate.

589
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:13,042
Nothing major.

590
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:15,251
Just gonna tie you off, pal, alright?

591
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,084
Better safe...

592
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:25,917
- Am I... Am I Fred West?
- No.

593
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:44,871
- This is the last from Normandy.
- Nice one, Prosser.

594
00:44:45,709 --> 00:44:46,876
Cheers Jonesy.

595
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:49,709
- I'm alive?
- No.

596
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:55,084
Kilo Five Bravo,
ETA on cas evac, over.

597
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:56,792
Wait out.

598
00:44:58,834 --> 00:44:59,751
Look out.

599
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:17,459
Kilo Five inbound.
ETA on task one zero minutes. Over.

600
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:20,167
Confirm minutes one zero. Over.

00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:22,917
Confirm. Wait out.

602
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:26,126
You hear that, Stu? Ten minutes, pal.

603
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:28,042
What they sending, Mark?

604
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:29,959
They'll send what they send.

605
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:34,542
They gonna touch down or...

606
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:36,334
Tug, we'll work it out, fuck.

607
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:38,709
Stu!

608
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:27,292
Path safe.

609
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:30,542
- Alright. Moving day, gents.
- Right.

610
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:35,001
You, you, you and you on Stu.
You guys grab anything that's left.

611
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:41,376
Strong grip. My count, on three.
One, two, three.

612
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,792
- Strain. One, two, three.
- Here we go.

613
00:46:45,959 --> 00:46:47,584
Oi, somebody get my rifle.

614
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:49,892
- Cheers, mucker.
- Yeah, I've got it, mate.

615
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:50,797
- That alright?
- Yeah.

616
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:53,001
Here, Jonesy, give us your bergen, pal.

617
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:58,792
You alright up there, Stu?

618
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:02,042
Like the Maharajah of Helmand Province,
aren't you.

619
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:04,251
You want to peel me a grape?

620
00:47:05,209 --> 00:47:07,529
Nah, but I've got a couple
of ripe plums here, if you want.

621
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:12,959
Kilo Five Bravo to Kilo Five Alpha.

622
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:16,959
Casualty moved to pick-up point.
ETA on cas evac. Over.

623
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:24,501
Hello Kilo Five Alpha,
this is Kilo Five Bravo. Over.

624
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:25,582
Do you need anything else?

625
00:47:25,607 --> 00:47:29,126
Kilo Two to Kilo Five Bravo.
Your man's on the TACSAT to the JOC.

626
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:34,667
Cas evac options are fluid, believe we have Black
Hawks inbound to you from Kandahar. Wait out.

627
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:35,709
Job guys.

628
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:37,584
Cas evac inbound.

629
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:40,501
I need overwatch
from all of you, got that?

630
00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:44,459
Stretcher bearers and Tug stay with Stu.

631
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:48,459
All other personnel, thank you for your
help, boys, and you can all fuck off now.

632
00:47:48,751 --> 00:47:50,084
- Cheers crap hat.
- Endex.

633
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:51,709
Oi.

634
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:54,667
Stuey, smile for the camera, buddy.

635
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:55,959
Stu.

636
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:57,792
- Fancy getting a photo?
- Alright.

637
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:58,834
Where's my bergen?

638
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,054
Oh, fuck, sorry mate. I took it over there.

639
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,246
- That's one for the khazi, that one.
- Stu!

640
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:05,861
- Bring that other med bergen out with you, yeah?
- Will do.

641
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:09,667
You alright, Mark?

642
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:12,709
You smash those fuckers tonight, yeah?

643
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:14,542
Will do, buddy.

644
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:16,292
With fucking pleasure.

645
00:48:17,709 --> 00:48:19,209
You faggots, stop flirting.

646
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:24,334
If you're the Russians, you know, seventy-nine,
eighty and you're defending Normandy...

647
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:26,376
Where'd you lay your APs?

648
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:29,626
- Try not to fuck it up from here, aye?
- Dead ground on approaches to the OP.

649
00:48:30,084 --> 00:48:32,001
- Why, what's up?
- Dunno.

650
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:34,842
What the fuck are mines
doing down here, mate?

651
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:46,917
Oh, for fuck's sake.

652
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:53,167
Oh, fuck. I'm down.
Lads I'm down.

653
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:57,292
Fuck. My leg. My fucking leg!

654
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:01,115
- Stu, wait, I'm coming.
- Jay, Smudge, get the fuck back!

655
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,390
Stand fast, Smudge,
the whole place is fucking loaded.

656
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:04,876
I stood on a fucking...

657
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,959
Safe route is not fucking safe, man.

658
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:09,167
Fuck! Fuck!

659
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:11,376
Let's go.

660
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:13,876
Somebody get me
some fucking morphine.

661
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:17,709
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck off.
- It's alright, Stu.

662
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:20,671
- Let me do my job, buddy. Let me do my job.
- Leave me! Fucking leave me!

663
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:22,987
- Stuey... Stu.
- Fuck! Fucking hell.

664
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:27,376
- Was it fucking Stu?
- Come on. Come keep your shit together.

665
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:32,224
- Alex, do you need any kit?
- Get off me.

666
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:34,626
Leave me. Just fucking leave me.

667
00:49:35,126 --> 00:49:36,766
- Right, all done.
- Nice and tight, mate.

668
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:37,541
Yup.

669
00:49:39,001 --> 00:49:40,417
- Get ready to take his leg.
- No!

670
00:49:40,459 --> 00:49:42,709
Right.

671
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:47,167
Fuck! Fuck!

672
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:50,834
- OK, all done.
- Any kit out?

673
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:54,001
Right, move it.

674
00:49:54,209 --> 00:49:57,709
- Fuck. Oh, fuck!
- OK, mate.

675
00:49:57,834 --> 00:50:00,167
- Fucking hell! It really...
- Right, alright...

676
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,292
- Fuck!
- What kit have you got?

677
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,792
- Oh fuck!
- Mate, where's your fucking bergen?

678
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:07,126
He was carrying it.

679
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:09,542
What have you got?

680
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:12,876
Morphine, tourniquet,
saline, dressing. One of each.

681
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:13,834
Ken, elevate the leg!

682
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:18,542
- What do you need, pal. Let me know.
- Stay there, Tug. Just fucking stay with Stu.

683
00:50:18,584 --> 00:50:22,917
- Mark. Now Mark do you need me in there?
- Stand firm, Jar Head. No one in.

684
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,342
Help yourself here.
Here take the fucking leg.

685
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:29,134
Kilo Two to Kilo Five Bravo. SITREP, over.

686
00:50:29,175 --> 00:50:30,292
- Take his leg.
- Yeah.

687
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:31,614
- His leg, mate.
- Move it, move.

688
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:32,919
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

689
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:39,209
Kilo Five Bravo. Mine strike,
Stu Pearson. P one, left leg.

690
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:42,459
Notify cas evac
need for second winch. Over.

691
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:46,626
Kilo Two to Kilo Five Bravo.
It's a negative on the winch. Over.

692
00:50:48,084 --> 00:50:52,042
Say again. I was informed
Black Hawk was inbound, over.

693
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:56,584
We'll get you out of there.
Just hang tight, Bravo. OK, wait out.

694
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,292
Going to fucking shit!

695
00:50:58,334 --> 00:50:59,876
- Come on.
- Fuck you!

696
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:02,251
Can we not just take him over the ridge?

697
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:06,042
Right, there's a... there's a route up to
Normandy already. It's already fucking marked.

698
00:51:06,084 --> 00:51:07,684
Just take 'em up there.
Enough is e-fucking-nough

699
00:51:07,709 --> 00:51:08,892
- we're getting blown up here!
- Smudge, Smudge, Smudge.

700
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:10,957
Did you not just see
what happened to your pal, Stu?

701
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:12,999
- Yeah!
- The fucking whole place is charged, mate.

702
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:15,251
We're going nowhere.
Fucking sit down.

703
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:18,751
Turn your fucking head around and
don't look anywhere except for up there.

704
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:21,042
Just don't look at him, alright?

705
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:27,459
See, you hear that?
Angels with fucking wings.

706
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,667
Fuck me. Fuck!

707
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:37,209
That's not a Black Hawk.

708
00:51:40,334 --> 00:51:42,001
Chopper inbound.

709
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:46,209
Laid them in fucking threes, didn't they?

710
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:47,376
What's that, pal?

711
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:51,959
Fucking APs. Fuck.

712
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:55,959
Hit the guy treating the first victim.

713
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:58,751
Maximum clusterfuck.

714
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:00,459
That's a Chinook.

715
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:02,639
They'll be dropping the MERT at Lancaster.

716
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:06,751
How you doing, fella? You alright?

717
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:11,126
Save my nuts, Doc. That's all I ask.

718
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:15,167
Fuck.

719
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:17,792
Hey. Your nuts are fine.

720
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:21,917
- Fuck. Alex, it's still bleeding, mate.
- What? Yeah, alright, smart.

721
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,626
- This is my last tourniquet.
- Oh, fuck!

722
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:33,987
- Boys... this fucking minefield.
- Alright, mate. Alright.

723
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:36,042
Fuck!

724
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:39,326
Here's something to put on it.

725
00:52:40,709 --> 00:52:41,501
Alright.

726
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,666
- Right, hold this fucking leg too.
- Yeah, brother.

727
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:46,371
- Fuck you!
- Alright, mate, we've got you.

728
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:55,876
Kilo Five Bravo to all Kilos.
We have a Chinook inbound.

729
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:58,251
Please confirm this is not
our cas evac, over?

730
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,871
- Snoop, you got a med pack?
- Kilo Four, affirmative.

731
00:53:00,896 --> 00:53:02,626
- Nah.
- Kilo Five Bravo. Cas evac inbound.

732
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,427
- Luke, med pack?
- Nah, I got nothing, mate.

733
00:53:04,452 --> 00:53:07,077
Recommend move
casualty to HLS nearby. Over.

734
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:11,959
Negative. Confirm, we have two,
repeat, two P ones requiring cas evac.

735
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:15,876
Movement impossible due to
location being minefield...

736
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:19,667
Chinook unsuitable for pick-up
due to location being minefield

737
00:53:20,126 --> 00:53:24,209
Request HH sixty with winch
as previously indicated.

738
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:26,834
Location is a fucking minefield. Over.

739
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:33,417
Chinook only asset
available at present. Over.

740
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:37,334
Can I have direct comms with Chinook?

741
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:41,542
Negative Kilo Five Bravo,
oomms via JTAC to apache to Chinook.

742
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:46,834
- Whoever this is, come in.
- Go ahead, Bravo.

743
00:53:47,126 --> 00:53:51,251
Suggest Chinook enter via
re-entrant to south west.

744
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:56,126
Back wheels down onto the rocks.
We'll drop smoke.

745
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:00,042
We may be able to load
one casualty this way. Over.

746
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:05,042
- Wait out.
- You fucking wait out, pal.

747
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,709
Kilo Two to Kilo Five Bravo.

748
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:11,042
They're not gonna land
in a minefield, buddy. Just sit tight.

749
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:14,334
Hey! Drop smoke.

750
00:54:16,251 --> 00:54:18,459
We need to show him
where to touch down, yeah.

751
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:44,126
Not land in the fucking Wadi.
This is a hot HLS, repeat, mines, over

752
00:54:48,584 --> 00:54:51,167
The fucking rocks. Land on the rocks.

753
00:54:57,542 --> 00:55:00,876
- What's he fucking saying?
- He wants to bring him over.

754
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:01,957
Alright, let's do it then.

755
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:04,607
No fucking way.
That's thirty metres to fucking carry him.

756
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:06,584
- You fuck off!
- Bring him on!

757
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:11,459
We fucking wait! We get them to send in
the ATOs, clear us a fucking path out.

758
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:18,042
Ammunitions Technical Officer.
ATO, fucker.

759
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:21,626
ATO.

760
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:24,584
ATO.

761
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:26,709
What the fuck are they doing?

762
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:28,959
ATO.

763
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:32,584
- TO. Take off.
- It's like the fucking YMCA.

764
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:35,376
ATO.

765
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,626
- Charlie, what's going on?
- They're not moving.

766
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:42,751
They're signalling something.
I can't work it out.

767
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:44,417
What's going on, mate?

768
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:46,859
The airframe's here, but we can't
get you fucking over there.

769
00:55:46,884 --> 00:55:47,801
For fuck's sake.

770
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:52,959
Any call sign, tell the bird
to clear the fuck out of here!

771
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:58,667
This is a hot HLS, repeat, mines. Over.

772
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:03,126
They are posing a major risk
to themselves and to us!

773
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:46,542
Jar Head, SITREP.

774
00:56:53,459 --> 00:56:54,917
Jar Head, SITREP

775
00:56:56,876 --> 00:56:58,417
- Jar head!
- Yeah?

776
00:56:58,459 --> 00:56:59,792
Fucking SITREP.

777
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,917
Mark's taken it in the chest

778
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:05,376
and Stu's been hit again.

779
00:57:05,876 --> 00:57:07,209
<i>And the meds down.</i>

780
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:08,751
Alex.

781
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:12,167
Alex?

782
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:14,584
OK?

783
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:16,709
OK?

784
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:25,751
Oi, Jar Head, get him out of here, man.
Fucking get that man up.

785
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:28,917
Fucking get him out of here.
You do not let that fucking man drop!

786
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:30,584
Come on man,
get your arse over here.

787
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,001
Get him out. Help him out!

788
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:35,876
It's alright, mate, come on.

789
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:42,084
Tug!

790
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:45,126
What do I do?

791
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:48,542
Tug, what do I fucking do?

792
00:57:55,959 --> 00:57:56,876
Tug!

793
00:57:57,917 --> 00:57:59,667
Tug! Tug, what do I fucking do?

794
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:14,834
You Fu

795
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:16,709
Somebody get that

796
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:24,542
- I'm fucking dying, man.
- What do I do?

797
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,667
Just hang fucking tight, Mark.

798
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:29,167
I'm gonna get you out of here.

799
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:35,417
SCREAMS OF INJURED SOLDIERS

800
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:37,584
Come and help me out!

801
00:58:37,876 --> 00:58:38,792
Tug!

802
00:58:39,084 --> 00:58:40,917
Tug, what we doing?

803
00:58:42,376 --> 00:58:43,876
Prosser! Triage!

804
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:51,792
Prosser! Triage!

805
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:58,542
Mark's got wounds to the chest.
It's pretty fucking ugly.

806
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:00,667
Stu's been hit again but...

807
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:03,209
I can't see where,
there's fuck loads of blood.

808
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:04,709
Where's the fucking chopper?

809
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:06,709
And Ken's got no fucking idea.

810
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:09,834
And w...
what med kit have you got?

811
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:11,751
Fuck all!

812
00:59:12,584 --> 00:59:15,584
I left the day sack over there.
It's still got a bit of stuff left.

813
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,209
OK.

814
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:22,501
Ken. Ken, should be a day sack
near you. Can you see it?

815
00:59:24,459 --> 00:59:27,709
- Yeah, yeah it's here.
- Alright, pal. Can you try and reach it for me?

816
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:35,167
Ken, fucking hell.

817
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:38,009
- He's gonna set off another...
- Ken, Ken! Don't worry about it, mate.

818
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:40,803
We'll fucking sack it off, mate.
Don't worry we'll try something else.

819
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:44,453
- Wait, I'm nearly there.
- Ken, don't do it! No! No, Ken, fucking don't!

820
00:59:48,709 --> 00:59:50,251
I've got it! I've got it!

821
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:51,626
Oh, God.

822
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:54,667
OK, what's it got?

823
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:58,584
IV fluids. Some dressings.

824
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:05,126
- Two sticks of morphine. That's it.
- Tourniquet. Has it got a tourniquet?

825
01:00:06,709 --> 01:00:07,959
No, no. That's all there is.

826
01:00:09,251 --> 01:00:10,292
Ken, listen to me.

827
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:14,126
You need to get those
dressings to Mark's chest.

828
01:00:14,834 --> 01:00:16,514
Yeah, you need to make
your way over there.

829
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:17,834
Now, Ken.

830
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:41,001
OK. OK. OK.

831
01:00:43,876 --> 01:00:48,292
- OK, I'm here. I'm here.
- Right then... l want you to use a rifle sling

832
01:00:49,126 --> 01:00:51,667
to tourniquet his arm, yeah?

833
01:00:53,084 --> 01:00:55,792
And that'll stop the bleeding. Alright?

834
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:59,959
Ken, catch.

835
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:09,209
- OK... OK.
- That's it, tourniquet his arm.

836
01:01:09,251 --> 01:01:12,459
And try to cannulate
and get some IVs into him.

837
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:17,292
That's it, tourniquet his arm. Yeah.

838
01:01:18,459 --> 01:01:21,542
No, just stop. Mark. Mark, I've got to!

839
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:27,292
- You need to try to cannulate.
- Mark!

840
01:01:30,334 --> 01:01:31,751
Just a circle, mucker.

841
01:01:32,959 --> 01:01:35,459
Tie it in a circle and put it
round his arm, alright mate?

842
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:41,001
Put it round his arm and tie it tight,
it'll stop the bleeding.

843
01:01:41,376 --> 01:01:43,657
Nobody's asking you to do
open fucking heart surgery, Ken.

844
01:01:43,682 --> 01:01:44,876
<i>Where, Presser'.!</i>

845
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,542
Where do you want me to fucking tie it?

846
01:01:46,709 --> 01:01:49,417
His arm is barely fucking hanging on!

847
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:51,792
Mark, please.

848
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:53,542
Please, Mark, please.

849
01:01:54,626 --> 01:01:56,042
Fuck off!

850
01:01:57,709 --> 01:01:59,042
Someone get me out.

851
01:02:01,459 --> 01:02:02,751
Fucking hell.

852
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:06,747
Yeah, yeah, yeah, alright, alright,
Ken, Ken, Ken. Just forget the tourniquet.

853
01:02:06,772 --> 01:02:09,147
Use the t-shirt, plug the fucking hole.

854
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:10,459
OK, let me...

855
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:12,917
- <i>Mark, stop. Mark.
- Presser.</i>

856
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:16,417
- Where's the fucking Motorola?
- Fucking stop, mate! OK, OK, OK.

857
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,834
Must have gone up with Mark.

858
01:02:24,084 --> 01:02:28,751
Ken. Ken, look at me. You're doing a
fucking great job, alright mucker.

859
01:02:40,084 --> 01:02:41,751
Fucking hell!

860
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,209
Fucking wait. Sit, sit down.

861
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:47,417
Tug.

862
01:02:48,126 --> 01:02:51,166
If you get yourself pinged halfway
we've got ourselves a whole new nightmare.

863
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:55,334
But I'm the only... I'm the only medic
and this is the only fucking med kit.

864
01:02:56,604 --> 01:02:59,684
You were just telling Smudge not to be a
dick, right don't do anything stupid.

865
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,251
Yeah, but this is stupid.

866
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:03,501
It is a bit fucking stupid.

867
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:06,001
Yeah but I've got a plan.

868
01:03:14,084 --> 01:03:18,376
- Listen, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
- Woah, Woah, woah. Easy, mate, what is it?

869
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:20,542
Come on.

870
01:03:22,084 --> 01:03:22,917
What's up.

871
01:03:23,126 --> 01:03:24,459
It's my fucking lung.

872
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:34,834
- Fucking hell.
- You're supposed to land on the fucking thing.

873
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:37,209
Fuck off.

874
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:41,376
OK. OK. OK...

875
01:03:53,126 --> 01:03:54,542
OK. OK.

876
01:04:01,501 --> 01:04:04,376
- That's much better.
- Fuck off!

877
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:10,209
OK. OK, now.

878
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:16,792
OK. OK. OK...

879
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,084
Come on you fucking pussy.
Fucking hell.

880
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:32,709
What are you doing, Tug?

881
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:36,751
You can shut up, Mark.
Before I change my fucking mind.

882
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:39,876
It's too fucking dangerous. Stop it.

883
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,542
I need you to put a tube in me.

884
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:45,792
- What?
- You're a... team medic.

885
01:04:46,834 --> 01:04:52,001
No, mate, no. No, no that was, that was two
days in Belfast, man. Two fucking years ago.

886
01:04:52,042 --> 01:04:54,751
Piece of piss. I put one
in a Terry a few weeks ago.

887
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,084
What's your name?

888
01:04:57,501 --> 01:04:59,001
- Wha...
- I said...

889
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:00,417
- Harvey.
- What's your name?

890
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:01,167
Jar Head.

891
01:05:01,376 --> 01:05:05,709
Jar Head. My right lung's collapsed.
If you don't cut me...

892
01:05:06,376 --> 01:05:11,626
stick this in my chest,
I'll stop breathing and die.

893
01:05:13,834 --> 01:05:16,501
Second rib. Mid clavicular.

894
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:21,667
I've asked you once,
I can't ask again. Just out me.

895
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:23,584
Fucking...

896
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:28,542
Halfway, Tug. Fucking awesome.

897
01:05:29,917 --> 01:05:31,751
It's like watching him
mount his missus.

898
01:05:41,876 --> 01:05:44,251
Fucking hell...
What the fuck am I doing?

899
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:45,917
Oh, fuck...

900
01:05:52,459 --> 01:05:54,001
Oh, fuck it.

901
01:05:56,459 --> 01:05:58,417
Sod's law you get pinged
on the way back anyhow.

902
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:02,542
Here, I thought I told you
about not walking into a room

903
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,424
until you know how
you're walking out of there.

904
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:13,376
OK. OK. You can fucking do this. You can
fucking do this. You can fucking do this.

905
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:17,626
Why the fuck not.
You can fucking do this! Fuck it.

906
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:20,542
OK. OK.

907
01:06:22,709 --> 01:06:25,376
It's alright. I trust you.

908
01:06:26,834 --> 01:06:27,584
Second rib.

909
01:06:29,626 --> 01:06:31,251
Just go, right.

910
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:34,792
- Three...
- Hey! Doctor coming down.

911
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,167
Fuck's sake.

912
01:06:37,251 --> 01:06:38,626
Thank fuck for that.

913
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:42,167
Tension pneumothorax.

914
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:44,417
- What?
- Tension pneumothorax.

915
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,334
Right side. I need it released, now.

916
01:07:05,876 --> 01:07:07,876
Fuck you, fucking fuck.

917
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:10,417
Sir.

918
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:12,542
Where's my camera?

919
01:07:14,084 --> 01:07:16,184
- I need my fucking photos.
- Oi, Tug. Hold him still, buddy.

920
01:07:16,209 --> 01:07:18,101
- He's gonna set off another f...
- Stu, stop fucking moving, mate.

921
01:07:18,126 --> 01:07:19,559
- I need my fucking camera.
- Alright, alright, alright.

922
01:07:19,584 --> 01:07:20,934
We'll get your photos,
just stop fucking moving, please.

923
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,459
Hey, pal, cas evac.

924
01:07:23,209 --> 01:07:27,001
Ken, you got a drink of water,
mate, I'm fucking dying here.

925
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:31,084
No, no, no, I'm out, mate.

926
01:07:32,626 --> 01:07:35,334
Tug. Have you got any water?

01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:49,792

Ken, Ken, I'll get to you when I can, OK?

944
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:40,709
There's a tourniquet
and a morphine pen, yeah.

945
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:43,584
- You know what you're fucking doing, lad.

Be with you in a minute, man.
Be with you in a minute.

947
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:48,501
Tug, I need some fucking morphine.

01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:49,334
OK, OK.

949
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:51,376
Oh, god!

950
01:09:53,084 --> 01:09:54,917
I need some fucking morphine.

Yeah, I'm with you, Stu. I'm with you.
Prosser!

953
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:05,334
I need you to lean on your side, don't let
any shit drain into the good one, yeah.

954
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,626
Lean up on that rock there.

01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:18,751
Stu, have a pen, yeah? Find somewhere soft,
give it ten. That's your lot, alright?

957
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:19,626
Thanks, mate.

958
01:10:22,876 --> 01:10:24,542
What are we going to do with you?

959
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:26,292
Fuck, you.

960
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:29,042
Alright, mate. Alright, OK.

961
01:10:29,334 --> 01:10:31,042
Where's the fucking blood going?

962
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:45,417
You're alright, pal. I got you.

963
01:10:47,251 --> 01:10:48,292
Bite down.

964
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:59,959
You only stay with us now, OK?

965
01:11:01,584 --> 01:11:07,126
Lad it's alright.
Yeah, take it easy now, alright.

966
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:11,917
Hold on a minute. Any minute
the helicopter's gonna come, right?

967
01:11:14,751 --> 01:11:16,167
Stay with us, now, OK?

968
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,751
<i>Presser, are we ready'?</i>

969
01:11:47,459 --> 01:11:48,501
Hold on.

Alright, lads.

971
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:55,251
ZAP numbers on my say, yeah.
Give the medics a head start.

972
01:11:57,667 --> 01:12:01,959
Half a fucking job, Ken. Could have done it
a lot better myself, but it'll do for now.

973
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:04,721
- It still fucking hurts!
- You've had your left pin nipped off, pal.

974
01:12:04,746 --> 01:12:07,066
It's meant to hurt, but
the morphine'll kick in soon, yeah.

975
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:25,667
OK, OK, go.

976
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:30,459
Alright, Stu. Go, pal.

979
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:41,561
It's important information,
it could save your fucking life, pal.

980
01:12:41,602 --> 01:12:43,144
Cool it, Mark, cool it, Mark, cool it.

01:12:43,269 --> 01:12:43,959

Keep an eye on Stu, yeah.
He's all over the fucking shop.

996
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:48,481
He's slamming the morphine sticks
like they're fucking voddies.

997
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:50,917
How's it look?

998
01:13:52,084 --> 01:13:56,626
Barlow, Fusilier, AL, 2RRF.

- Why you called Ken?
- Don't be a spaz, Tug.

1002
01:14:07,751 --> 01:14:09,292
Ken Barlow?

1003
01:14:12,751 --> 01:14:14,084
Ken fucking Barlow?

01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:20,834

OK, OK, pal. Alright, alright.

1006
01:14:37,126 --> 01:14:40,334
Here you are, Stu, pal.
Let's get some water on board.

1007
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:53,501
- [Hey.

1008
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:59,376
- What's your name, scalie?
- Jonesy, Jones.

1009
01:15:01,959 --> 01:15:05,001
- It's a shit nickname.
- You do any better?

1010
01:15:06,834 --> 01:15:09,501
- Stu.
- That's not a nickname.

1011
01:15:11,001 --> 01:15:12,209
Stu Hale.

1012
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:15,251
Haley. I...

1013
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:21,376
- I tried to get them to go for Halo.
- Nice.

1014
01:15:22,542 --> 01:15:25,292
- But Stu stuck.
- So...

1015
01:15:25,834 --> 01:15:27,542
what do they call the other Stu?

1016
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:30,209
Stu.

1017
01:15:31,084 --> 01:15:33,001
Someone needs to look at that.

1018
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:38,209
It's all my fault, isn't it?

1019
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:40,876
No.

1020
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:44,584
- It's not your fault, mate.
- Don't talk like that, mucker.

1021
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:49,084
Think about getting out of here.
Think about your family.

1022
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:51,751
Yeah. Hey, yeah.
Have you got any kids?

1023
01:15:52,376 --> 01:15:59,126
Jimmy. He's five.
He's, he's a good kid. An...

1024
01:16:00,501 --> 01:16:05,584
And I got another one on the way... Yeah.

1025
01:16:08,584 --> 01:16:09,542
Oi, Smudge.

1026
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,209
You tell Shannon, yeah...

1027
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:19,167
You tell her if it's a boy

1028
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:24,126
you fucking tell her
to call him Alexander, yeah?

1029
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:28,001
And if it's a girl, call her Sofia.

1030
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,084
Would you do that mate, for me, yeah?

1031
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:35,697
- I need you to fucking do that for me.
- Shut up! No, I'm not gonna tell her that.

1032
01:16:35,722 --> 01:16:37,014
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

1033
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:39,042
Right, cause if I need to clear a route

1034
01:16:39,084 --> 01:16:41,417
with my bare fucking hands
all the way to Camp Bastion

1035
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:43,667
I'm getting you out of this gash pit.
Do you hear me?

1036
01:16:43,751 --> 01:16:46,334
And it's not gonna be,
what is it, Sofia, fucking Alexander

1037
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:49,542
it'll be fucking Smudge Junior,
or Smudgella.

1038
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:53,834
And I'll tell you something else, mush,
you're gonna fucking make selection and all.

1039
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:57,931
You're gonna be the first fucking one-legged,
bunny-hopping badge there's ever been, alright?

1040
01:16:57,956 --> 01:17:02,001
So none of this fucking
platform four, self-pity fucking bullshit.

1041
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:04,209
We spent too much BST
getting you this far.

1042
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:08,334
We haven't given up on you, the least you
could do is not give up on us, you cunt.

1043
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:17,667
Jesus, Smudge, easy on.

1044
01:17:19,709 --> 01:17:23,001
- 'Gash pit'.
- Shut the fuck up.

1045
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,376
Fucking beautiful.

1046
01:17:37,626 --> 01:17:40,917
Shit. Tug, it still fucking hurts.

1047
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:45,542
The morphine'll work, pal.
You just got to give it time.

1048
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:48,459
It's been a fucking hour, man.

1049
01:17:50,084 --> 01:17:53,501
It's been half an hour, Ken.
Let me tell you something, Ken.

1050
01:17:53,542 --> 01:17:56,542
The more you shout, the faster your
heartbeat, the quicker you'll bleed out.

1051
01:17:56,876 --> 01:18:00,376
Alright, so it's for your own good, and ours,
just shut your fucking jimmy, alright.

1052
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,751
OK, OK.

1053
01:18:08,376 --> 01:18:10,816
Alright, Mark, I'm just gonna
have another look at this, yeah?

1054
01:18:10,841 --> 01:18:13,091
It's gonna fucking hurt so bite down, mate.

1055
01:18:15,042 --> 01:18:15,959
OK.

1056
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:32,667
Right, all of you. Just fucking...

1057
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,782
ignore this next bit, yeah,
ignore what I fucking say.

1058
01:18:35,834 --> 01:18:41,084
Jay, Smudge. I'm gonna talk shit
for a bit to keep things moving, alright?

1059
01:18:41,126 --> 01:18:44,501
Just fucking... everyone
fucking ignore what I say, OK?

1060
01:18:48,584 --> 01:18:50,542
Right, listen to me, you pricks!

1061
01:18:50,876 --> 01:18:54,751
We've been waiting for this
chopper for three fucking hours.

1062
01:18:54,959 --> 01:19:00,126
And if it don't come soon, and I'm talking
now, people are gonna start dying down here.

1063
01:19:00,876 --> 01:19:03,417
Minutes, alright,
that's what we've fucking got.

1064
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:06,459
You have to fucking sort it out!

1065
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,792
C... cas evac. How long?

1066
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:31,376
Just gonna catch forty winks, lads.

1067
01:19:31,751 --> 01:19:34,584
- Stu.
- While Cathy gets her nails done.

1068
01:19:34,876 --> 01:19:38,156
- No fucking Kraut's getting this deck chair off me.
- Stu, don't go to sleep, man.

1069
01:19:39,751 --> 01:19:41,584
Unless they want a fucking set to...

1070
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:45,126
- Stu, you're talking shit, pal.
- I'm up, I'm up.

1071
01:19:45,459 --> 01:19:46,376
Sorry, man.

1072
01:19:47,251 --> 01:19:50,334
Fuck. I'm back in the room, lads.
I'm back in the room.

1073
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:56,417
Fuck. Hey, lads.

1074
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:01,126
I'd kill anybody right now
for a cold tin of brew, so is.

1075
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,417
That's it, mate.
Cheerful fucking thoughts.

1076
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:16,001
- Mark, you're getting married, so I hear.
- Aye. November.

1077
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:20,001
Just as well lads,
think my wanking days are over.

1078
01:20:22,209 --> 01:20:24,376
Might need to get my suit
re-measured though.

1079
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:34,251
Think she can fucking recognise me?

1080
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:37,959
Course she fucking will.

1081
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,126
- Mark?
- Aye?

1082
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:46,542
You gonna, you gonna
have a big piss-up afters?

1083
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:55,126
You bet you.
Minto Hotel. Bells and whistles.

1084
01:20:55,209 --> 01:20:55,959
Yeah?

1085
01:20:56,209 --> 01:21:00,084
If we get out of this, you,
you lads are all coming, yeah.

1086
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:01,959
- Cash bar?
- Fuck you.

1087
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:03,876
Fucking cash bar.

1088
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:05,584
Fucking arse.

1089
01:21:06,334 --> 01:21:08,334
Free bar, fuck, free bar.

1090
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:13,376
Fucking hell. That's diamond.
I'm gonna fucking go all out.

1091
01:21:13,417 --> 01:21:14,626
Aye?

1092
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:17,751
I haven't been legless
since February.

1093
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,709
You don't need to fucking worry
about that anymore, do you, Barlow?

1094
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:29,876
I'm gonna be fucking
legless every night, now.

1095
01:21:31,084 --> 01:21:32,292
Ken Barlow.

1096
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:37,917
Hey, lads. I just realised, we don't need
to worry about the third mine anymore.

1097
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:43,167
Good old Ken's fucking
found it for us. Cheers Ken!

1098
01:21:45,917 --> 01:21:49,334
- Always getting dicked, mate.
- The really funny thing is boys...

1099
01:21:50,376 --> 01:21:53,296
they didn't get fucking planted here,
they all just washed off the hill

1100
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:56,803
and down to the river beds.
There could be fucking hundreds of them...

1101
01:21:58,834 --> 01:22:01,667
All around here. All around us.

1102
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:05,209
Great place for a fucking bimble, lads.

1103
01:22:06,042 --> 01:22:08,501
Quick snipe,
then it's tea and fucking medals.

1104
01:22:08,626 --> 01:22:10,167
Cas evac, ten minutes.

1105
01:22:28,459 --> 01:22:33,751
What's his name...
fucking, Jeffery Dahmer?

1106
01:22:34,626 --> 01:22:36,459
No. Two more.

1107
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:39,667
Jack the Ripper.

1108
01:22:40,376 --> 01:22:43,376
No. Last guess, make it a good one.

1109
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:48,626
- Come on, give me, give me some more...
- What did you say? 'Rules is rules, ' Stu.

1110
01:22:49,542 --> 01:22:51,417
I just had my fucking leg blown off, mate.

1111
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:58,584
Is that how it's gonna be now? 'Oh, my
poor leg. Oi, lend us a quid, Smudge.'

1112
01:22:58,959 --> 01:23:00,001
Alright, fuck off.

1113
01:23:07,417 --> 01:23:09,459
- Hannibal Lector?
- Nah.

1114
01:23:10,334 --> 01:23:11,459
Let's call it quits.

1115
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:15,501
Harold Shipman.

1116
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:18,417
Harold fucking who?

1117
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:21,042
Harold Shipman, the doctor of death.

1118
01:23:21,876 --> 01:23:23,417
No, I've never heard of him.

1119
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:27,209
Of course you have. He killed, like,
two-hundred people, maybe more.

1120
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:30,584
- He's not, like, fucking world famous, is he?
- He's from your neck of the woods.

1121
01:23:30,626 --> 01:23:32,209
You know exactly who I'm talking about.

1122
01:23:34,251 --> 01:23:38,709
- Well, there's not a fucking plaque to him.
- He's up there. You'd be surprised.

1123
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:40,197
We're never getting out of here.

1124
01:23:41,876 --> 01:23:43,584
I reckon you made him up.

1125
01:23:56,501 --> 01:23:57,542
Ten minutes.

1126
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,876
Kenneth Arthur Barlow.

1127
01:24:11,334 --> 01:24:12,209
Hey, Ken!

1128
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:18,334
- It still fucking hurts.
- Yeah, that's good, mucker.

1129
01:24:19,959 --> 01:24:22,917
If it's hurting it means
you're alive, mate. Alright?

1130
01:24:26,626 --> 01:24:27,417
Stu.

1131
01:24:30,084 --> 01:24:31,292
Stu, punch your card.

1132
01:24:32,792 --> 01:24:34,667
- My camera...
- Fucking camera, pal.

1133
01:24:39,126 --> 01:24:40,876
I need more fucking morphine.

1134
01:24:42,417 --> 01:24:45,834
You take the pain, Stu.
You're a big lad, you'll be alright.

1135
01:24:52,126 --> 01:24:52,834
Mark?

1136
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:58,917
No fucking snoozing, boys, yeah?

1137
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:04,084
- Prosser? You with us?
- Yeah.

1138
01:25:04,626 --> 01:25:06,251
Y... yeah. Yeah.

1139
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:08,167
Keep talking to me, Prosser.

1140
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:11,001
Talk about what?

1141
01:25:12,084 --> 01:25:13,126
You tell me, pal.

1142
01:25:15,084 --> 01:25:16,459
We could talk about the weather.

1143
01:25:17,542 --> 01:25:19,126
Short, fucking conversation.

1144
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:27,501
T... tell you what, I'm trying to think
if I've had worse birthdays than this.

1145
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:32,376
And I've had some shit ones.

1146
01:25:39,126 --> 01:25:41,251
When I was eight, my...

1147
01:25:42,334 --> 01:25:44,376
mum and dad clean out fucking forgot.

1148
01:25:46,834 --> 01:25:51,501
All daylong I was thinking
they're just pretending.

1149
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:55,417
They're gonna spring this monster
fucking surprise on me.

1150
01:25:57,209 --> 01:25:59,251
Even when I'm having my tea

1151
01:26:00,209 --> 01:26:01,792
in the bath

1152
01:26:02,751 --> 01:26:04,751
getting into fucking bed...

1153
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:07,959
I'm thinking, 'These guys are good.'

1154
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:14,376
Then they shut the door,
turned out the lights

1155
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:17,917
and that was it.

1156
01:26:19,751 --> 01:26:21,876
I cried like a burst fucking drain.

1157
01:26:25,001 --> 01:26:27,667
- Then they came back in though, yeah?
- No.

1158
01:26:28,376 --> 01:26:32,126
No. They fucking forgot.

1159
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:34,751
But this is shitter.

1160
01:26:38,334 --> 01:26:40,376
Well, we can do something
about that, can't we boys?

1161
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:42,834
Stu.

1162
01:26:43,334 --> 01:26:45,251
Ken, Mark.

1163
01:26:46,209 --> 01:26:48,334
Happy birthday to you!

1164
01:26:48,376 --> 01:26:49,959
Right, come on boys, fucking loud, Stu.

1165
01:26:50,501 --> 01:26:53,126
Happy birthday to you!

1166
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:54,167
Loudefl

1167
01:26:54,334 --> 01:27:01,542
Happy birthday, David Prosser,
happy birthday to you!

1168
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:04,584
One more time, boys, loud.
Nice and loud, let him hear you.

1169
01:27:05,084 --> 01:27:07,126
Happy birthday to you!

1170
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:08,251
- Ken, let's hear you.
- OK.

1171
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:11,042
Happy birthday to you!

1172
01:27:12,417 --> 01:27:19,417
Happy birthday, David Prosser,
happy birthday to you!

1173
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:26,751
Happy birthday to you. Happy bir...

1174
01:28:09,459 --> 01:28:13,376
Tug. Stay on fucking target, man.

1175
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:18,126
My leg still fucking hurts.

1176
01:28:22,459 --> 01:28:25,126
Tug, this fucking morphine isn't working.

1177
01:28:28,334 --> 01:28:29,751
There ain't no more, Ken.

1178
01:28:35,876 --> 01:28:36,584
Tug.

1179
01:28:40,376 --> 01:28:41,917
Tug, give me another stick.

1180
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:45,542
Don't you fucking drop.

1181
01:28:48,084 --> 01:28:49,501
Just fucking give it me, pal.

1182
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:53,834
Don't you drop, Stu.
Don't you dare fucking drop.

1183
01:28:55,751 --> 01:28:57,084
You hang in there, mate.

1184
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:59,334
You fucking hear me?

1185
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:04,084
We're <i>3</i> Para and we're going
to get through this together.

1186
01:29:06,251 --> 01:29:09,667
We are <i>3</i> fucking Para.

1187
01:29:10,376 --> 01:29:12,584
Remember the fucking history, boys.

1188
01:29:13,959 --> 01:29:16,751
Mount Longdon.

1189
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:21,376
Fucking Kajaki, now.

1190
01:29:29,334 --> 01:29:32,292
We are <i>3</i> fucking Para.

1191
01:29:34,251 --> 01:29:36,084
Don't you dare fucking drop.

1192
01:29:38,876 --> 01:29:42,626
We are <i>3</i> fucking Para.

1193
01:29:44,209 --> 01:29:49,626
Utr/nque Para <i>tus.</i>
'Ready for fucking anything'.

1194
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:55,334
You fucking hear me?

1195
01:30:11,959 --> 01:30:16,751
Lancashire is wonderful!

1196
01:30:18,084 --> 01:30:22,001
Lancashire is wonderful!

1197
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,917
It's full of tits

1198
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,792
fanny and Wanderers.

1199
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:32,584
Lancashire is wonderful...

1200
01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:39,334
Water?

1201
01:30:39,792 --> 01:30:41,834
- What?
- Water.

1202
01:31:06,834 --> 01:31:07,876
There we go.

1203
01:31:09,792 --> 01:31:10,959
That's it, pal.

1204
01:31:11,626 --> 01:31:14,501
- OK?
- I'm good. I'm finished. Fucking...

1205
01:31:15,209 --> 01:31:16,501
it's disgusting, man.

1206
01:31:18,501 --> 01:31:21,901
Hey, give us a minute, man. I think I've got
a bottle of champagne in the fucking bag.

1207
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:30,209
Looks like you're out of luck, mate.

1208
01:31:32,834 --> 01:31:35,959
- It's funny...
- What's that?

1209
01:31:38,917 --> 01:31:42,001
My mum always said
I was born under a lucky star.

1210
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:43,084
How?

1211
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:51,542
Kept on winning things,
you know, like raffles and stuff.

1212
01:31:51,667 --> 01:31:52,417
Yeah.

1213
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:58,792
I won her a pair of diamond
earrings at the Sabre Centre.

1214
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:02,001
She always wore them when I came home.

1215
01:32:06,376 --> 01:32:08,251
And I've always felt lucky.

1216
01:32:09,876 --> 01:32:11,084
My life.

1217
01:32:14,126 --> 01:32:15,126
My job.

1218
01:32:17,209 --> 01:32:18,334
Gill.

1219
01:32:21,751 --> 01:32:22,834
So lucky.

1220
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:28,209
You're no' fucking wrong, Mark.

1221
01:32:31,959 --> 01:32:34,084
You're the luckiest guy I know, mate.

1222
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:39,376
You could sail through
a shit storm, buddy

1223
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:43,459
and come out smelling
of fuckin' roses.?

1224
01:32:51,459 --> 01:32:52,459
There you go.

1225
01:32:54,876 --> 01:32:57,001
You'll come out of this as well, too, pal.

1226
01:32:59,251 --> 01:33:01,584
I think my luck's run out, guys.

1227
01:33:03,084 --> 01:33:06,292
No, pal, you just gotta...
you just gotta hold on.

1228
01:33:08,084 --> 01:33:09,292
Just hold on, pal.

1229
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,251
I'm cold, Tug.

1230
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:19,501
I'm fucking cold.

1231
01:33:20,626 --> 01:33:23,042
Not long now, Mark.
We'll have you out of here.

1232
01:33:24,959 --> 01:33:29,667
- I'm going, I can feel it, I'm fucking dying...
- No, you're... you're not.

1233
01:33:30,376 --> 01:33:32,709
- I am.
- No, you're not. You're alright... Fine...

1234
