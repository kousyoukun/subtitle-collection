Dr Gopnik, I believe the results

62
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,853
of the physics midterm
were unjust.

63
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,586
Uh-huh? How so?

64
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,928
I received
unsatisfactory grade.

65
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,263
In fact, F,
the failing grade.

66
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,034
Yes. You failed the midterm.
That's accurate.

67
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,698
Yes, but that is not just.

68
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,910
I was unaware to be
examined on the mathematics.

69
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:15,141
Well, you can't do physics without
mathematics, really, can you?

70
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,706
If I receive the failing
grade, I lose my scholarship,

71
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,082
and I feel shame.

72
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,819
I understand the physics.
I understand the dead cat.

73
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,484
But you can't really
understand the physics

74
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,322
without understanding
the math.

75
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,160
The math tells how it really
works That's the real thing.

76
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,827

class are just illustrative.

to help give you a picture.

I mean...

79
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,809
Even I don't understand
the dead cat.

80
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,777
The math is how
it really works.

81
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,178

82
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,671

83
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,774
Well, I'm sorry, but I...

84
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,944
What do you propose?

85
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,146
- Passing grade.
- No, no.

86
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,449
Or perhaps I can
take the midterm again.

87
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,286
I know now it cover
the mathematics.

88
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,088
Well, the other students
wouldn't like that, would they?

89
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,688
If one student gets to retake the
test until he gets a grade he likes?

90
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,432
- Secret test
- No...

91
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,133
- Hush-hush.
- No.

92
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,761
That's just not workable.

93
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,864

the bullet on this thing, Clive...

gave you the pot?

ago, my funding got cut off.

out of me if I didn't pay up.

- No.

have become very close.

Well, what do they say?

325
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,757
Well, they
make allegations...

326
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,889
Well, allegations...
Assertions.

327
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,868
And though we give them
no credence at all, Larry.

328
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,194
Well, I'm not really
at liberty

329
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,867
to discuss the specifics of
the committee's deliberations.

330
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:07,673
But I think you're saying these won't
play any part in your deliberations?

331
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,043
None whatsoever.

332
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,081
So what are they?

333
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,014
Moral turpitude,
you could say.

334
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,181
Uh-huh. Can I ask? Are they...

335
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,281
- Are they idiomatic?
- Hmm?

336
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:24,192
The reason I ask, I have a
Korean student. South Korean.

337
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:28,130
A disgruntled South Korean, and I
meant to talk to you about this...

338
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:33,398
Oh, no, no They're competently,
even eloquently written.

339
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:37,066
A native English speaker.
There's no question about that.

340
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,542
- Uh-huh.
- Let me reiterate.

341
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,078
No cause for concern.

342
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:45,981
I only speak because I
would feel odd concealing it.

343
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,711
- Yes.
- Yeah.

344
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,812
Best to Judith.

345
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,994
I gotta get
my radio back.

346
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,293
Maybe the fucker lodged
it up his fucking asshole.

347
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,733
I gotta get it back, or Mike Fagle's
gonna pound the crap out of me.

348
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,270

- Way up his asshole.

349
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,679
Good afternoon.

350
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:27,747
Go scrub up, Mitch.

351
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:30,953
Been hunting?

352
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:38,968
Is that a...

353
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,470
It's gonna be
a boat shed.

354
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,835
Uh-huh.

355
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,929
That's great.

356
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,976

- I said scrub up, Mitch!

357

Isn't this a school day?

358
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,444
I took him out of school today
so he could hunt with his dad.

Uh, Mr Brandt,

360
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,627
that's just about at
the property line there.

361
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,059

we're supposed to get

362
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,789
...within, what, 10 feet...
- Property line's the poplar.

363
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,294
- The...
- Poplar.

364
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,630
- Well, even if it is, you're just
about over it. - Measure.

365
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,706
- I don't have to measure, you
can tell it's... - Line's the poplar.

00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,667
Nothing.

- Yeah?

369

Did you go to
Sieglestein Schlutz?

370

Not yet.

Appointment Monday.

373
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,851
Where are you going?

374
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,184
I'm going to the Hole.

375
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,849
What? At 5:00?

376
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,416
We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's
house so I can wash my hair.

377
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,052
Hi, Mr Gopnik.

378
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,591
- You can't wash it here?
- Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.

379
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,257
ARTHUR: I'll be out
in a minute!

380

- Huh?

381
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,025
- We're meeting Sy at Embers.
- I am?

382
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,435
Both of us.
I told you, Larry.

383
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,669
Larry.

384
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,104
How are you?

385
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:58,940
Sy.

386
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,543
Hello, Judith.

387
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,609
Hello, Sy.

388
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:09,088
Larry, I want to
thank you for coming.

389
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,921
It's so important that we be
able to discuss these things.

390
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,726
I'm happy to come
to Embers, Sy.

391
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,290
But I'm thinking, really,
maybe it's best to leave

392
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,733
these discussions
to the lawyers.

393
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,636
Of course Legal matters,
you let the lawyers discuss.

394
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,731
You don't mix
apples and oranges.

395
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,241
I have begged you
to see the lawyer.

396
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,572
I told you,
I'm going Monday.

397
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,306
Monday is timely.
This is not...

398
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,077
Please, Embers is not the forum
for legalities You're so right.

(SCOFFS)

400
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,811
No, Judith and I wanted
merely to discuss, uh,

401
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,090
practicalities.
Living arrangements.

402
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,259
After all, this is an issue
where no one is at odds.

403
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,490
Living arrangements?

404
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,896
I think we all agree
that the children

405
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,063
not being contaminated
with the tension,

406
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,265
the most important.

407
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,331
We shouldn't put the kids
in the middle of this, Larry.

408
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,466
The kids aren't...

409
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,476
I'm saying "we."
I'm not pointing fingers.

410
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,274
No one is playing
the blame game, Larry.

411
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,440
I didn't say
anyone was.

412
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,484
Well, let's not play "He
Said, She Said," either.

413
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,609
- I wasn't! I...
- All right. Look, look, look.

414
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,452
Let's just take a step back and
we can diffuse the situation.

415
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,153
You know, Larry,
sometimes I find that

416
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,924
if I count to 10...

417
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,924
One,

418
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,191
two,

419
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,762
three,

420
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,435
four...

421
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,707
Or silently.

Danny's bar mitzvah...

424
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,653
A child's
bar mitzvah, Larry.

425
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,455
Sy and I think it's best if
you move out of the house.

426
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,785
Move out?

427
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,331
- Well, it makes eminent sense.
- Things can't continue as they...

428
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,867
Move out?
Where would I go?

429
00:38:56,968 --> 00:39:00,028
Well, for instance, the
Jolly Roger is quite livable.

430
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,400
It's not expensive.

431
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,066
The rooms are
eminently habitable.

432
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,665
This would allow you
to visit the kids.

433
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,836
There's convenience in its
favor They've got a pool.

434
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,574
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to move in with Sy?

Larry.

436
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:17,180
Larry, you...
You are jesting.

437
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,021
I think, really,
the Jolly Roger

438
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,152
is the appropriate
course of action.

This is defamation!

482
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,463
It doesn't make sense. Either
he left the money or he didn't.

483
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,871
Please.
Accept the mystery.

484
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,041
RONNIE: Give me that, fucker.

485
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,616
LARRY: He's very
good with numbers.

486
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:34,055
I think his social skills
have held him back.

487
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,149
Such a sweet man, though.

488
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,524
Arthur has
a good heart.

489
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,029
And he never complains,
unlike me.

490
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,000
Sometimes I don't
give him enough credit.

491
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,834
He tried to tell me about this
thing he's working on, this...

492
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,736
The Mentaculus.

493
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:56,070
He says it's a probability
map of the universe.

494
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,413
Does he go out
socially at all?

495
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,509
He tries. He's been going to the
singles mixers at Hillel House.

496
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,055
I should talk.
I'm not doing any better.

497
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,689
How is Judith?

498
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,526
Fine. She's fine.

499
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:20,371
Sometimes these things
just aren't meant to be.

500
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:24,340
And it can take a while before
you feel what was always there.

501
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,775
- For better or worse.
- I never felt it!

502
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,077
It was a bolt
from the blue.

503
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:31,375
What does that mean?

504
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:35,215
Everything that I thought was
one way turns out to be another.

505
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:40,918
Then, it's an opportunity to
learn how things really are.

506
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,692
I don't mean to sound glib.

507
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,794
It's not always easy deciphering
what God is trying to tell you,

508
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:53,531
but it's not something you have
to figure out all by yourself.

509
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,301
We're Jews.

510
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,710
We've got that well of tradition
to draw on, to help us understand.

511
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,075
When we're puzzled,
we have all the stories

512
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,879
that have been handed down from
people who had the same problems.

513
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,912
Have you talked to
Rabbi Nachtner?

514
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,627
Why not see him?

515
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,388
What's the Rabbi
gonna tell me?

516
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,491
If I knew,
I'd be the Rabbi.

517
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:24,563
(EXCLAIMS) The air out
here is magnificent.

518
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:30,167
I'm telling you, if someone
could bottle this air,

519
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,071
they'd make
a million dollars.

520
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,760
Hello, Larry.
Good to see you.

521
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,193
Oh. Rabbi Scott.

522
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:55,658
I thought I was going
to see Rabbi Nachtner.

523
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,859
He was called away
on an etz monim.

524
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,666
Ruth Brynn's mother is in the
hospital and she isn't doing well.

525
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:05,037
Rabbi Nachtner asked me to
cover for him. Come on in.

526
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:20,122
And she wants a gett.

527
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,221
A what?

528
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,697
- She wants a...
- Oh, a gett.

529
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,359
Uh-huh. Sure.

530
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,833
I feel like the carpet's
been yanked out from under me.

531
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,171
(STAMMERING) I don't
know which end is up.

532
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,039
I'm not even sure
how to react.

533
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,475
I'm too confused.

534
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,576
What reasons did she
give for the rupture?

535
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,243
She didn't give reasons
Just that,

536
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,582
you know, things
haven't been going well.

537
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,746
And is that true?

538
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,913
I guess.
I don't know.

539
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,186
She's usually right
about these things.

540
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,728
I was hoping that
Rabbi Nachtner could...

541
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,255
That he would...
He would... Yes?

542
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,595
Well, with the benefit
of his life experience.

543
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,528
No offense.

544
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:08,766
(CHUCKLING) No, of course
not I am the junior rabbi.

545
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,206
And it's true, the point of
view of somebody who's older

546
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:17,714
and perhaps had similar
problems might be more valid.

547
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:20,842
And you should see the senior
rabbi as well, by all means.

548
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,112
Or even Marshak,

549
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,383
if you can get in.

550
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,049
He's quite busy,
but maybe...

551
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,919
Can I share
something with you?

552
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:36,198
Because I, too, have had
the feeling of losing track

553
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,065
of Hashem,
which is the problem here.

554
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:42,402
I, too, have forgotten
how to see him in the world,

555
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,532
and when that happens,
you think,

556
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,602
"Well, if I can't see him,
he isn't there. He's gone."

557
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,471
But that's not the case.

558
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:53,974
You just need to
remember how to see him.

559
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,383
(CHUCKLING)
Am I right? I mean...

560
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,479
The parking lot here.

561
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,926
Not much to see.

562
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,258
But if you imagine
yourself a visitor,

563
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,001
somebody who isn't familiar
with these autos and such,

564
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,663
somebody still with
the capacity for wonder.

565
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,935
Someone with
a fresh perspective.

566
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,806
That's what it is, Larry.

567
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,935
Because with
the right perspective,

568
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:25,471
you can see Hashem, you
know, reaching into the world.

569
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,313
He is in the world,
not just in shul.

570
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,923
It sounds to me like you're looking
at the world, looking at your wife,

571
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,925
through tired eyes.

572
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:40,189
It sounds like she's
become a sort of thing...

573
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,455
A problem.

574
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,126
A thing.

575
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,328
She is seeing Sy Ableman.

576
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,973
- Oh.
- They're planning...

577
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,511
That's why
they want the gett.

578
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:56,842
Oh I'm sorry.

579
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,471
It was his idea.

580
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:03,987
Well, they do need a gett
to remarry in the faith.

581
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,214
But... This is life.

582
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:13,060
You have to see these things
as expressions of God's will.

583
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,064
You don't have to
like it, of course.

584
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,831
The boss isn't always right,
but he's always the boss.

585
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,699
(LAUGHING)
That's right!

586
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,532
Things aren't so bad.

587
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,903
Look at
the parking lot, Larry.

588
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,806
Just look at
that parking lot.

589
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,142
(PANTING)

590
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,089
Are we eating already?

591
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,595
Sarah's going out.

592
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,561
Ow! Cut it out!

593
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:49,894
What's going on?

594
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,196
Isn't Dad eating?

595
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,605
JUDITH: He's at
the Jolly Roger.

596
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:00,905
Oh, yeah.

597
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,776
(ALL SLURPING)

598
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,375
How are you, Larry?

599
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,942
Jesus, I am so sorry

600
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,578
- to be seeing you under these
circumstances. - Oh, well...

601
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,250
I always thought you
and Judy were rock solid.

602
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,590
This is so terrible, Larry.
This is devastating.

603
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:20,061
Well, you know,
the way I look at it,

604
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,692
it's an opportunity for me to
really sit down and figure things out

605
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:28,034
and look at the world afresh
instead of just, you know,

606
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:32,041
settling for the routine, tired
old way of looking at things.

607
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:34,937
Really?

608
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,714
I don't know,
maybe not.

609
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,716
Well, legally,
I have to warn you,

610
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,255
it's never easy
for the husband.

611
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,155
Unless, of course,
there's some question

612
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:52,491
of the wife having violated
the marriage contract?

613
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,621
Oh, no, no
Nothing like that.

614
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:57,292
Although she is planning to
marry Sy Ableman, but they...

615
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,766
Sy Ableman!

616
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:02,931
- Yes. But they...
- Esther is barely cold!

617
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,072
She passed
three years ago.

618
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:09,340
Well... Still, this changes
the complexion, Larry.

619
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:11,179
Sy Ableman.

620
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,080
Not in the sense that... T
here hasn't been hanky-panky.

621
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,243
To my knowledge.

622
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,617
- Oh? - No I'm fairly
certain this is not an issue.

623
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,852
And in fact,
Judith wants a gett.

624
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,520
A what?

625
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,187
A ritual divorce.

626
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,426
- Oh.
- So that they can remarry in the faith.

627
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,765
Uh-huh.
Yeah, sure, uh...

628
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,862
Well, not really
a legal issue.

629
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:38,036
Okay, um...

630
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,974
Good. Good.

631
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,474
(SIGHING) Well...

632
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,983
On the other thing, the
neighbor's property line,

633
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,679
I've asked Solomon
Schlutz to take a look.

634
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:53,154
There's very little to do with
real estate that'll get by Sol.

635
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:54,987
Okay Good
How do you...

636
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,549
I guess
I'm a little worried.

Hello, Mr Gopnik?

This is Dick Dutton from
the Columbia Record Club.

664
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,511
I'm calling because
it's now four months,

receive your first payment.

There's some mistake.

I'm not a member
of the Columbian Record Club.

Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik
of 8419 Fern Hill Road?

00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,995
No, I live
at the Jolly Roger.

Excuse me?

No, I...

Well, yes, okay.

00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,208
- Yes, you are Lawrence Gopnik?
- Okay.

Okay, yes,
Lawrence Gopnik, yes.

Okay, well, you received
your 12 introductory albums,

Is that a record?

for any records.

To receive the monthly main
selection, you do nothing. You...

That's right.
I haven't done anything.

682
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,191
Yes, that's why you received
the monthly main selection.

00:53:22,331 --> 00:53:27,030
- (STAMMERING) But...
- The last one was Santana Abraxas. You...

I didn't ask
for Santana Abraxas.

685

You request
the main selection

at the retail price
by doing nothing.

687

It's automatically
mailed to you,

plus shipping
and handling.

- I can't afford a new record every month!

Santana Abraxas.

I'm sorry, sir.

Well, thank you.
But I...

Are you okay?

Yes, yes.

Okay. Good.

listen to Santana Abraxas.

- Sir?
- Look...

703
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,822
(STAMMERING) I didn't ask
for Santana Abraxas,

I didn't listen
to Santana Abraxas,

I didn't do anything!

listen to the record...

Okay, I have to
call you back.

- Danny?
- Um...

715
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,849
Danny, this is completely
unacceptable. I can't afford to...

716
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,649
Okay, Dad, but you
gotta come home.

Or that we are all one

an appliance.

something unusual.

There appears to be
something engraved

He calls the goy back

784
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:51,022
on the pretense of needling additional
measurements for the appliance.

Can Sussman sleep?
Sussman can't sleep.

Sussman looks at the molds
of his other patents,

goy and Jew alike,

797
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,962
seeking other messages.
He finds none.

798
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,567
He looks In his own mouth.

799
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,232
Nothing.

800
00:59:41,143 --> 00:59:43,043
He looks
in his wife's mouth.

801
00:59:48,584 --> 00:59:49,710
Nothing.

802
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:52,747
But Sussman
is an educated man.

803
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:54,816
Not the world's
greatest sage, maybe.

804

No Rabbi Marshak.

805
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:59,484
But he knows a thing or two
about the Zohar and the Kabbalah.

806
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:02,962
He knows that every Hebrew
letter has its numeric equivalent.

is ever to sleep again.

Not much.

account in your name only.

953
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:24,236
Put your paychecks in
there from here on out.

954
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:26,068
- Can I?
- Oh, absolutely.

955
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:27,698
It's not dishonest?

956
01:07:27,776 --> 01:07:29,505
Oh, absolutely.

957
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:31,170
- You...
- I hate to say this,

958
01:07:31,246 --> 01:07:35,012
but I think she's also been
sneaking cash out of my wallet.

Oh, boy Oh, boy.

There's no need for that.

We're going to

Have you talked
to the Rabbi?

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

968
01:08:10,452 --> 01:08:12,147
I talked to Nachtner.

969
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:15,489
Was he helpful
at all?

970
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,621
What, did he tell you
about the goy's teeth?

971
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:24,658
You should try to
talk to Marshak.

972
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:28,096
They told me he doesn't
do pastoral work anymore.

973
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,262
He just...

01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:34,839
Well, that's too bad.

977
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,643
He's a very wise man,
Marshak.

979
01:08:41,516 --> 01:08:42,676
Very old.

980
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:45,683
No, me.

981
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:50,183
- Uh, Dick Dutton. Columbia Record Club.
- Not now.

982
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,021
Does he ever
come to the phone?

983
01:08:55,597 --> 01:08:58,031
If I came in, could...

984
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:04,037
Well, how about at Rabbi
Marshak's convenience?

985
01:09:05,707 --> 01:09:06,935
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

986
01:09:07,442 --> 01:09:10,343
Well, could I give you
my number at the Jolly Roger?

987
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:13,141
LARRY: X squared,
so that delta X equals

988
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:16,309
the square root of
.077 A squared minus zero,

989
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:19,616
from which we derive the
square root of .077 A squared.

990
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,212
And also, the uncertainty

991
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,622
in P is equal to the square
root of bracket P squared

992
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,161
minus bracket P squared,

993
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,720
which also equals the square
root of H over A squared.

994
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:32,561
Which lets us
delta X, delta P

995
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:36,570
equals the square root
of.077 A squared,

996
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:42,042
H over A squared,
and 1.74 H bar.

997
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:43,509
Okay?

998
01:09:43,578 --> 01:09:45,136
The Uncertainty Principle.

999
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:48,841
It proves we can't
ever really know

1000
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,475
what's going on.

But even though you can't
figure anything out,

1003
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,593
you will be responsible
for it on the mid-term.

1004
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,764
- Did you follow that?
- Of course.

1005
01:10:08,403 --> 01:10:11,031
Except that I know
what's going on.

1006
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,197
How do you explain?

1007

Well, it might be that in,

Excuse me, not the point.
In this world, Larry.

1009
01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:25,179
Now I'll concede that
it's subtle, it's clever.

1010
01:10:25,887 --> 01:10:28,617
But at the end of the day,
is it convincing?

1011
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:31,092
Well, yes,
it's convincing.

1012
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:33,218
It's a proof.
It's mathematics.

1013
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:37,629
No, excuse me. Mathematics
is the art of the possible.

1014
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:40,367
I don't think so.

1015

The art of the

Something else.

I thought you weren't here.

I heard something.

Can I help you?
Do you want to come in?

- No, I...
- It's cooler.

Oh. Okay.

isn't around, and I, uh...

- He travels.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

1035
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,653
So I thought I should let you know,
since you're somewhat new here,

to help others, in a neighborly way.

- How thoughtful.
- Oh, it's nothing.

1039

It's just good to know
your neighbors, and to help.

Help others.

Although I don't care much for my
neighbors on the other side, I must say.

- Goys, aren't they?
- Mmm. Very much so.

to judge. I have to admit...
