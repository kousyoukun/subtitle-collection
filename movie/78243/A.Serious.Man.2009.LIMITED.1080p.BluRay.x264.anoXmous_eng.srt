Dr. Gopnik, I believe the results

62
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,852
of the physics midterm
were unjust.

63
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,605
Uh-huh? How so?

64
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,940
I received
unsatisfactory grade.

65
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,276
In fact, F,
the failing grade.

66
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,030
Yes. You failed the midterm.
That's accurate.

67
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,698
Yes, but that is not just.

68
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,910
I was unaware
to be examined
on the mathematics.

69
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,163
Well, you can't do
physics without mathematics,
really, can you?

70
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,708
If I receive
the failing grade,
I Lose my scholarship,

71
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,084
and I feel shame.

72
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,838
I understand the physics.
I understand the dead cat.

73
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,508
But you can't really
understand the physics

74
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,344
without understanding
the math.

75
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,181

how it really works.
That's the real thing.

it really works.

83
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,952

No, no.

take the midterm again.

the mathematics.

wouldn't Like that,
would they?

You didn't talk to him?
No.

00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,906
Well, allegations. . .
Assertions.

323
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,869
And though we
give them no credence
at all, Larry.

324
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,204
Well, I'm not really
at liberty
325
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,874
to discuss the specifics of
the committee's deliberations.

325
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,669
But I think you're saying
these won't play any part
in your deliberations?

326
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,046
None whatsoever.

327
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,088
So what are they?

328
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,008
Moral turpitude,
you could say.

329
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,179
Uh-huh.
Can I ask?
Are they. . .

330
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,307
Are they idiomatic?
Hmm?

331
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,186
The reason I ask,
I have a Korean student.
South Korean.

332
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,148
A disgruntled South Korean,
and I meant to talk to you
about this. . .

333
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:33,403
Oh, no, no.
They're competently,
even eloquently written.

334
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:37,074
A native English speaker.
There's no question
about that.

335
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,534
Uh-huh.
Let me reiterate.

336
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,078
No cause for concern.

337
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,999
I only speak because
I would feel odd
concealing it.

338
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,709
Yes.
Yeah.

339
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,837
Best to Judith.

340
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,013
I gotta get
my radio back.

341
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,307
Maybe the fucker
Lodged it up his
fucking asshole.

342
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,727
I gotta get it back,
or Mike Fagle's gonna
pound the crap out of me.

343
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,270

Way up
his asshole.

344
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,702
Good afternoon.

345
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,749
Go scrub up, Mitch.

346
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:30,961
Been hunting?

347
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,969
Is that a. . .

348
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,470
It's gonna be
a boat shed.

349
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,847
Uh-huh.

350
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,931
That's great.

351
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,977
Mr. Brandt. . .
I said
scrub up, Mitch !

Isn't this a school day?

353
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,443
I took him out of school
today so he could
hunt with his dad.

354

(CLEARING THROAT)
Uh, Mr. Brandt,

355
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,617
that's just about
at the property line
there.

356
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,077
I don't think
we're supposed to get

357
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,787
within, what, 1 0 feet. . .
Property line's the poplar.

358
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,291
The. . .
Poplar.

359
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,627
Well, even if it is,
you're just about over it.
Measure.

360
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,714
I don't have to measure,
you can tell it's. . .

JUDITH: Larry?
Yeah?

364
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,849
Did you go to
Sieglestein Schlutz?

365
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,017
LARRY: No, I. . .
Not yet.

366

Appointment Monday.

368
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,854
Where are you going?

369
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,189
I'm going to the Hole.

370
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,857
What? At 5:00?

371
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,443
We're stopping at
Laurie Kipperstein's house
so I can wash my hair.

372
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,069
Hi, Mr. Gopnik.

373
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,614
You can't wash it here?
Uncle Arthur's
in the bathroom.

374
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,282
ARTHUR: I'll be out
in a minute!

375
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,450
JUDITH: Are you ready?
Huh?

376
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,035
We're meeting Sy
at Embers.
I am?

377
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,454
Both of us.
I told you, Larry.

378
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,665
Larry.

379
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,129
How are you?

380
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,965
Sy.

381
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,552
Hello, Judith.

382
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,637
Hello, Sy.

383
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,100
Larry, I want to
thank you for coming.

384
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,938
It's so important
that we be able to
discuss these things.

385
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,731
I'm happy to come
to Embers, Sy.

386
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,317
But I'm thinking, really,
maybe it's best to leave

387
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,735
these discussions
to the lawyers.

388
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,655
Of course. Legal matters,
you let the lawyers discuss.

389
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,740
You don't mix
apples and oranges.

390
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,242
I have begged you
to see the lawyer.

391
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,576
I told you,
I'm going Monday.

392
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,329
Monday is timely.
This is not. . .

393
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,083
Please, Embers is not
the forum for legalities.
You're so right.

394
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,251
(SCOFFS)

395
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,837
No, Judith and I
wanted merely
to discuss, uh,

396
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,091
practicalities.
Living arrangements.

397
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:45,262
After all, this
is an issue where
no one is at odds.

398
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,513
Living arrangements?

399
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,892
I think we all agree
that the children
401
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,062
not being contaminated
with the tension,

400
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,272
the most important.

401
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,357
We shouldn't put
the kids in the
middle of this, Larry.

402
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,483
The kids aren't. . .

403
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,485
I'm saying "we."
I'm not pointing fingers.

404
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,280
No one is playing
the blame game, Larry.

405
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,447
I didn't say
anyone was.

406
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,491
Well, let's not play
"He Said, She Said,"
either.

407
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,618
I wasn't! I. . .
All right.
Look, look, look.

408
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,455
Let's just take
a step back and we can
diffuse the situation.

409
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:18,169
You know, Larry,
sometimes I find that

410
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,921
if I count to 1 0. . .

411

A child's
bar mitzvah, Larry.

419
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,452
Sy and I think
it's best if you
move out of the house.

420
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,787
Move out?

421
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,332
Well, it makes eminent sense.
Things can't
continue as they. . .

422
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,875
Move out?
Where would I go?

423
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,045
Well, for instance,
the Jolly Roger
is quite livable.

424
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,421
It's not expensive.

425
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,090
The rooms are
eminently habitable.

426
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,675
This would allow you
to visit the kids.

427
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,844
There's convenience
in its favor.
They've got a pool.

428
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,597
Wouldn't it make
more sense for you
to move in with Sy?

Larry.

I think, really,
the Jolly Roger

00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,152
is the appropriate
course of action.

00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,471
It doesn't make sense.
Either he left the money
or he didn't.

475
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,890
Please.
Accept the mystery.

476
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,061
RONNIE: Give me that, fucker.

477
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,612
LARRY: He's very
good with numbers.

478
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,073
I think his social skills
have held him back.

479
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,159
Such a sweet man, though.

480
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,535
Arthur has
a good heart.

481
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,039
And he never complains,
unlike me.

482
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,000
Sometimes I don't
give him enough credit.

483
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,837
He tried to tell me
about this thing
he's working on, this. . .

484
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,756
The Mentaculus.

485
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:56,095
He says
it's a probability map
of the universe.

486
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,432
Does he go out
socially at all?

487
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,520
He tries. He's been
going to the singles
mixers at Hillel House.

488
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,066
I should talk.
I'm not doing any better.

489
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,693
How is Judith?

490
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,532
Fine. She's fine.

491
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,370
Sometimes these things
just aren't meant to be.

492
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:24,332
And it can take a while
before you feel
what was always there.

493
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,793
For better or worse.
I never felt it!

494
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,088
It was a bolt
from the blue.

495
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,381
What does that mean?

496
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:35,218
Everything that
I thought was one way
turns out to be another.

497
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:40,932
Then, it's an opportunity
to learn how things
really are.

498
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,685
I don't mean to sound glib.

499
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,816
It's not always easy
deciphering what God
is trying to tell you,

500
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,528
but it's not something
you have to figure out
all by yourself.

501
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,322
We're Jews.

502
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:00,702
We've got that well
of tradition to draw on,
to help us understand.

503
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,080
When we're puzzled,
we have all the stories

504
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:07,875
that have been
handed down from people
who had the same problems.

505
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,921
Have you talked to
Rabbi Nachtner?

506
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,634
Why not see him?

507
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,386
What's the Rabbi
gonna tell me?

508
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,513
If I knew,
I'd be the Rabbi.

509
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,559
(EXCLAIMS)
The air out here
is magnificent.

510
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,189
I'm telling you,
if someone could
bottle this air,

511
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,066
they'd make
a million dollars.

512
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,752
Hello, Larry.
Good to see you.

513
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,211
Oh. Rabbi Scott.

514
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,673
I thought
I was going to see
Rabbi Nachtner.

515
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,884
He was called away
on an etz monim.

516
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,679
Ruth Brynn's mother
is in the hospital
and she isn't doing well.

517
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,058
Rabbi Nachtner asked me
to cover for him.
Come on in.

518
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,114
And she wants a gett.

519
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,245
A what?

520
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,708
She wants a. . .
Oh, a gett.

521
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,377
Uh-huh. Sure.

522
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,838
I feel Like the
carpet's been yanked
out from under me.

523
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,174
(STAMMERING)
I don't know
which end is up.

524
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,051
I'm not even sure
how to react.

525
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,469
I'm too confused.

526
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,598
What reasons
did she give
for the rupture?

527
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,267
She didn't give reasons.
Just that,

528
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,603
you know, things
haven't been going well.

529
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,771
And is that true?

530
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,940
I guess.
I don't know.

531
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,192
She's usually right
about these things.

532
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,736
I was hoping that
Rabbi Nachtner could. . .

533
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,280
That he would. . .
He would. . . Yes?

534
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,616
Well, with the benefit
of his life experience.

535
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,535
No offense.

536
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,788
(CHUCKLING)
No, of course not.
I am the junior rabbi.

537
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,209
And it's true,
the point of view
of somebody who's older

538
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:17,714
and perhaps had
similar problems
might be more valid.

539
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,842
And you should see
the senior rabbi
as well, by all means.

540
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,135
Or even Marshak,

541
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,387
if you can get in.

542
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,056
He's quite busy,
but maybe. . .

543
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,937
Can I share
something with you?

544
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,190
Because I, too,
have had the feeling
of losing track

545
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,068
of Hashem,
which is the problem here.

546
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,405
I, too, have forgotten
how to see him in the world,

547
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,532
and when that happens,
you think,

548
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:48,619
"Well, if I can't see him,
he isn't there. He's gone."

549
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,496
But that's not the case.

550
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:54,000
You just need to
remember how to see him.

551
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,377
(CHUCKLING)
Am I right? I mean. . .

552
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,505
The parking lot here.

553
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,926
Not much to see.

554
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,263
But if you imagine
yourself a visitor,

555
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:12,018
somebody who isn't
familiar with
these autos and such,

556
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,687
somebody still
with the capacity
for wonder.

557
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,940
Someone with
a fresh perspective.

558
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,817
That's what it is, Larry.

559
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,944
Because with
the right perspective,

560
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,490
you can see Hashem,
you know, reaching
into the world.

561
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,326
He is in the world,
not just in shul.

562
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:33,915
It sounds to me Like you're
Looking at the world,
Looking at your wife,

563
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,917
through tired eyes.

564
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:40,213
It sounds Like
she's become
a sort of thing. . .

565
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,465
A problem.

566
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,133
A thing.

567
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,344
She is seeing Sy Ableman.

568
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,975
Oh.
They're planning. . .

569
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,519
That's why
they want the gett.

570
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,854
Oh. I'm sorry.

571
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,481
It was his idea.

572
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:03,986
Well, they do need
a gett to remarry
in the faith.

573
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,241
But. . . This is life.

574
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:13,079
You have to see these
things as expressions
of God's will.

575
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,081
You don't have to
Like it, of course.

576
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,834
The boss isn't always right,
but he's always the boss.

577
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,710
(LAUGHING)
That's right!

578
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,546
Things aren't so bad.

579
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,923
Look at
the parking lot, Larry.

580
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,802
Just look at
that parking lot.

581
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,140
(PANTING)

582
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,111
Are we eating already?

583
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,612
Sarah's going out.

584
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,573
Ow! Cut it out!

585
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,907
What's going on?

586
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,206
Isn't Dad eating?

587
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,624
JUDITH: He's at
the Jolly Roger.

588
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,918
Oh, yeah.

589
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,795
(ALL SLURPING)

590
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,383
How are you, Larry?

591
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,969
Jesus, I am so sorry

592
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,597
to be seeing you
under these circumstances.
Oh, well. . .

593
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,266
I always thought
you and Judy
were rock solid.

594
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,603
This is so terrible, Larry.
This is devastating.

595
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,062
Well, you know,
the way I look at it,

596
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,691
it's an opportunity
for me to really sit down
and figure things out

597
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:28,029
and look at the world
afresh instead of just,
you know,

598
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:32,033
settling for the
routine, tired old way
of Looking at things.

599
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:34,952
Really?

600
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,705
I don't know,
maybe not.

601
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,710
Well, legally,
I have to warn you,

602
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,254
it's never easy
for the husband.

603
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,174
Unless, of course,
there's some question

604
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:52,511
of the wife
having violated
the marriage contract?

605
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,639
Oh, no, no.
Nothing Like that.

606
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,308
Although she is
planning to marry
Sy Ableman, but they. . .

607
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,768
Sy Ableman !

608
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,939
Yes. But they. . .
Esther is barely cold !

609
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,066
She passed
three years ago.

610
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,362
Well. . .
Still, this changes
the complexion, Larry.

611
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,197
Sy Ableman.

612
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,075
Not in the sense
that. . . There hasn't
been hanky-panky.

613
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,242
To my knowledge.

614
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,621
Oh?
No. I'm fairly certain
this is not an issue.

615
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,874
And in fact,
Judith wants a gett.

616
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,544
A what?

617
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,214
A ritual divorce.

618
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,424
Oh.
So that they can
remarry in the faith.

619
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,760
Uh-huh.
Yeah, sure, uh. . .

620
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,887
Well, not really
a legal issue.

621
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,057
Okay, um. . .

622
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,977
Good. Good.

623
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,479
(SIGHING) Well. . .

624
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,983
On the other thing,
the neighbor's
property line,

625
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,694
I've asked
Solomon Schlutz
to take a look.

626
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,155
There's very little
to do with real estate

Sussman can't eat.

Can Sussman sleep?
Sussman can't sleep.

787

Sussman looks at the molds
of his other patients,

goy and Jew alike,

789
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,988
seeking other messages.
He finds none.

00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,574
He looks in his own mouth.

791
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,242
Nothing.

792
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,036

in his wife's mouth.

But Sussman
is an educated man.

greatest sage, maybe.

a thing or two about

It's hard. I think she
emptied our bank account.

942
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,193
Mmm.

943
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:16,364
I tried to ask her about it,
very civilly. She. . .
Yeah.

944
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:21,786
Yeah, you need to
open a new account
in your name only.

in there from

Oh, absolutely.

947
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,709
It's not dishonest?

Oh, absolutely.

been sneaking cash
out of my wallet.

01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,170
I talked to Nachtner.

Was he helpful
at all?

962

What, did he tell you
about the goy's teeth?

963
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,682
You should try to
talk to Marshak.

he doesn't do

Uh, Dick Dutton.

Does he ever
come to the phone?

If I came in, could. . .

01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,055
Well, how about
at Rabbi Marshak's
convenience?

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Well, could I give you
my number at the Jolly Roger?

979
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:13,148
LARRY: X squared,
so that delta X equals

980
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,317
the square root of
.077 A squared minus zero,

981
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,612
from which we derive
the square root of
.077 A squared.

982
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,239
And also, the uncertainty

983
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,617
in P is equal to
the square root
of bracket P squared

984
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,162
minus bracket P squared,

985
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,747
which also equals
the square root
of H over A squared.

986
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,584
Which lets us
delta X, delta P

987
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:36,588
equals the square root
of .077 A squared,

988
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:42,051
H over A squared,
and 1 .74 H bar.

Okay?

The Uncertainty Principle.

991
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,850
It proves we can't
ever really know

But even though you can't
figure anything out,

01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,613
you will be responsible
for it on the mid-term.

996
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,785
Did you follow that?
Of course.

997
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,039
Except that I know
what's going on.

998
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,208
How do you explain?

Well, it might be that in,

Now I'll concede that
it's subtle, it's clever.

1002
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,640
But at the end of the day,
is it convincing?

1003
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,100
Well, yes,
it's convincing.

1004
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,228
It's a proof.
It's mathematics.

1005
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:37,649
No, excuse me.
Mathematics is the art
of the possible.

01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,360
I don't think so.

1007

Uh-huh. Yeah.

1027
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:09,657

let you know, since you're
somewhat new here,

How thoughtful.
Oh, it's nothing.

It's just good to
know your neighbors,

Help others.

for my neighbors on the

Mmm. Very much so.

not fair to judge.
