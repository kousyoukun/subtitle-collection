1
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,333
I'm Danny.
2
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,875
Danny, right.
3
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,250
We've been expecting you.
4
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,791
First month, upfront.
5
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,541
Okay.
6
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,791
And if you ever come short,
you can always tell me.
7
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,708
There's always work that needs
to be done around here, so...
8
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,458
Have a nice stay.
9
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,750
You have to be here every
night from 7 p.m. to 8 a.m.
10
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,041
If you're not,
the judge in charge of your case
11
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,708
will be notified
immediately
12
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,333
and you will be sent
back to jail.
13
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:16,333
If you find work, call us,
and we will change the time.
14
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,708
Any questions?
15
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,791
No.
16
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,791
Leave the door open,
please.
17
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,916
Clara:
18
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,875
Laurence: Mm.
19
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,375
Clara: Hi!
20
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,166
Got a cigarette?
21
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,000
Laurence:
22
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,000
How's your room?
23
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,791
Danny: It's fine. Thank you.
24
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,833
Good.
25
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,041
That thing you said
yesterday...
26
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,166
What kind of job is it?
27
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,166
Danny: Well, you need
to redo the whole room.
28
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,875
Laurence: Why?
29
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,833
Or else you'll have to repaint
it every six months.
30
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,250
If you buy the material,
I'll do it for you.
31
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,041
You know how to do it?
32
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,083
Yeah, I do.
33
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,041
How much?
34
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,125
Two months' rental.
35
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,750
One.
36
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,625
Okay.
37
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,458
You take it back?
38
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,708
Yeah, I got it.
39
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,541
I'm gonna walk back.
40
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,833
You know the way?
41
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,250
I'll find it.
42
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,041
Okay.
43
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,916
Hey, what are you doing?
44
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,500
Huh?
45
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,458
Why you won't talk to me?
46
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,708
You're too shy or what?
47
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,875
Oh, come on!
48
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,291
Where are you going?
49
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,833
Going out for lunch?
50
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,333
Can I come with you?
51
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,500
No.
52
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,541
Why?
53
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,791
Please!
54
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm starving.
55
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,375
My mom's not here.
56
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,000
I have nothing to eat.
57
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,166
I'm gonna die.
58
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,583
Because of you.
59
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,166
Can you keep
your mouth shut?
60
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,291
I don't know...
61
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,375
Yeah.
62
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,000
Where are you from?
63
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,708
I know
you're from Denmark.
64
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,750
I know
you were in prison.
65
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,666
Well, I know
a lot about you.
66
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,000
So why do you
keep asking?
67
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,666
My dad says you never ask people
why they went to prison.
68
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,583
Well, you should listen
to your dad then, huh?
69
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,791
He's not around.
70
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,916
You know Tony Janssens?
71
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,541
No.
72
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,083
He's my dad.
73
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,583
He's in prison, too.
74
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,500
In Fresnes.
75
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,750
I'm not allowed
to visit him.
76
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,916
I don't know why, but...
77
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,333
whenever my mom goes,
78
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,541
she comes up with some excuse
not to bring me.
79
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:07,333
I think she doesn't want
me to see him anymore.
80
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,958
Or maybe he's the one who
doesn't want to see me.
81
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,833
I don't know.
82
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:16,208
But...I don't get it.
83
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,666
It's not fair.
I'm his daughter, you know.
84
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,250
Well, it's not easy
85
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,250
seeing your family
when you're inside.
86
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,291
You shouldn't judge him.
87
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,166
I'm not judging him.
88
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,708
I just want to see him.
89
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,666
You got kids?
90
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,250
No.
91
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,666
Why?
92
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,875
You don't like kids?
You didn't want them?
93
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,041
Or...you're...
94
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,541
...just too old?
95
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,458
I thought we had
an agreement.
96
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,750
You talk too much.
97
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,291
You know that?
98
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,833
You got a cigarette?
For me? Please?
99
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,875
You want it?
100
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,125
Yeah.
101
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,958
Take it.
102
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,166
You got it.
103
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,666
I'm looking for a job.
104
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,708
Wait here.
105
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,250
Hey!
106
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,291
Uh, yeah.
107
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,791
Just like me.
108
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,166
Yeah.
109
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,541
Look at the dog.
110
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,083
Yes, he's dirty.
111
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,500
Yeah.
112
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,833
He comes around
every day.
113
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,125
What are you doing?
114
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,583
Just trying to pet him.
115
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,583
He's not gonna let you.
116
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,791
Why?
117
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,333
Oh, fuck!
118
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,166
You see? I told you.
119
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,958
Why doesn't he
let me pet him?
120
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,416
'Cause he doesn't
trust you.
121
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,500
Laurence: Hi.
122
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,583
Hey!
123
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,750
My daughter told me
you took her out to lunch.
124
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,750
Yeah. Your daughter told me
she was starving.
125
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,375
Well, she...
126
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,750
Can you stop that, please?
So we can talk?
127
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,833
My daughter likes
to play games. Okay?
128
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,250
Don't get into it.
Please.
129
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,041
I'm not into little girls.
I prefer women my own age.
130
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,333
Good. I'll pay you back
the meal.
131
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:49,083
I don't want your money.
132
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,458
Then we have a problem.
133
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,875
Why?
134
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,416
'Cause I don't wanna owe you
anything.
135
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,250
You finished?
136
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,000
Want me to help you?
137
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,791
It's fine.
138
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:12,458
She talks about her dad
as if he's some kind of hero.
139
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,750
Isn't that normal?
140
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,750
All kids think
their parents are heroes.
141
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,166
Maybe.
142
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,791
What else did she tell you?
143
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,875
That she can't
visit her dad.
144
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,583
You won't let her.
145
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,250
Prison is not a place
for kids, is it?
146
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,750
It's only a visit.
147
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,750
He's getting out
in a few months, so...
148
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,375
You don't seem so excited
about that.
149
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,375
He's leaving me.
150
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,208
For a younger woman.
151
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,125
Some teacher he met
in a prison program.
152
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,333
You think that's funny?
153
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,250
No, sorry, it's just...
154
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,208
I've heard
that story before.
155
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:18,666
The convict and the teacher.
Kind of a classic.
156
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,333
Don't tell her, okay?
She doesn't know.
157
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,541
I won't.
158
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,041
That's not my business.
159
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,750
Here it is.
160
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,666
The machine
is not working,
161
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:19,083
so you have to do
everything yourself.
162
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,541
You're good?
163
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,958
Yes.
164
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,791
Okay, good luck then.
165
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,166
Hey.
166
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,375
I thought
you might be hungry.
167
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,916
Thanks.
168
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,541
Next time, eat with us
before the rush. It's better.
169
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,000
Actually, I kinda
like it out here.
170
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,958
I'm good.
171
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,125
What's your name?
172
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,875
I'm Danny.
173
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:29,500
Not really
into people, Danny.
174
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,833
See you.
175
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,458
Get out.
176
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,083
-Hey.
-Hey.
177
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,750
You want a glass of wine
or a beer?
178
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,166
A beer would be nice, yeah.
179
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,666
Okay.
180
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,916
Tough day?
181
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,375
How did you end up here?
182
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,791
What?
183
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,541
How did you end up here?
184
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:38,166
Just got out of jail.
185
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,416
Wow.
186
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,000
"Wow" what?
187
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,375
That's why you're looking
at me like this?
188
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,416
To freedom.
189
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,083
To freedom.
190
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,458
Fuck!
191
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,541
I need to go.
192
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:44,750
-You're late.
-Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
193
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,166
I got a job today.
194
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,208
In a restaurant.
195
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,541
It was my first day today.
196
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:54,416
Officer: I told you to call us
so we could adjust your hours.
197
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:59,541
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
198
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:01,500
Send us the details.
199
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,875
But if you are late again,
you're back inside.
200
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:08,125
Okay, I will. Thank you.
Bye.
201
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,750
Laurence:
202
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,208
Danny.
203
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,708
Ohh.
204
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,666
Aah! Uh!
205
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,083
Danny: Hey! Hey!
206
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,541
Clara.
207
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,458
Hey!
208
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,666
Hey.
209
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,750
Come on.
210
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,375
I'm gonna have to
take off your clothes.
211
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,916
You've got to help me.
212
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,833
Put your arms up.
213
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:20,375
I'm cold. I'm cold.
214
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,000
Stay with me, come on!
215
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,125
Aah! Oh!
216
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,791
Shh, shh.
217
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:36,125
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
218
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,166
Shh.
219
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,958
Be quiet, be quiet.
220
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,708
I need you to stand up,
come on.
221
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,708
Stand up, come on.
222
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,291
Yeah, get it out.
223
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,750
Can you take off
your clothes?
224
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,041
Can you take off
your clothes?
225
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:33,791
Throw that shit out.
Okay, sit down.
226
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,666
Here, wash yourself
with this.
227
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,791
Help me.
228
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,333
You can do it.
229
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,541
I feel dirty.
230
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,625
Stand up.
Can you do it yourself?
231
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,500
Stand up.
I've got you.
232
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,541
Don't tell my mom.
233
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:40,208
Don't tell her,
promise me.
234
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,166
It's okay, come on, wash it.
235
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,708
It's okay.
236
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:38,375
Who was that guy?
237
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:49,958
Who is he?
238
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,708
Clara,
you can't stay here.
239
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:10,583
Clara: Please.
240
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,541
No.
241
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:23,500
My dad isn't coming back.
242
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:06,416
Yeah.
243
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:38,000
Come on.
244
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,458
Danny?
245
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,375
Hey, Danny.
246
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:07,250
Yeah?
247
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,083
Did you see anything
strange last night?
248
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,125
No.
249
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,833
Did you see Clara?
250
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:18,833
She, um --
she's got bruises all over.
251
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,833
S-She said she got
into a school fight,
252
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,875
but I don't believe her.
253
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:45,583
I don't know anything.
254
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:48,416
Should I go to the cops?
255
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,541
Why do you want to go
to the cops?
256
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,500
Maybe she got assaulted.
257
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:59,958
She won't talk to me.
258
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,583
Try to be patient.
259
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,125
Okay?
260
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,166
Get the fuck away from me!
261
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,083
Get the fuck away!
262
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,833
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
263
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,208
Where did you go?
264
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,750
This is a business, okay?
You can't just go for a walk!
265
00:53:58,333 --> 00:53:59,625
Aah!
266
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:01,583
Ohh!
267
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,833
Fuck!
268
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,583
Ohh!
269
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:57,166
We need to talk.
270
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:02,500
The cops came.
271
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,416
A guy got killed.
272
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,625
They burnt his car
with him inside.
273
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,750
Do you know anything
about that?
274
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,416
I do.
275
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,916
T-That guy in the car...
276
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,166
...he raped Clara.
277
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:40,166
The night you went out.
278
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,083
How do you know?
279
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,125
I found her
in the parking lot.
280
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,833
Why didn't you tell me?
281
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:07,583
I made a promise.
282
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,166
What do you mean?
283
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:18,166
I promised her
not to tell.
284
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:25,000
My daughter gets raped,
285
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,875
and you promise her
not to tell me?
286
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:32,666
I'm her mother!
287
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,541
You're crazy.
288
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:46,458
You killed him, didn't you?
289
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,416
What was I supposed to do?
Let him go?
290
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:50,583
You should have gone
to the cops!
291
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,250
When my daughter got raped,
292
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,250
you should have gone
to the cops.
293
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm going.
294
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Yeah, fine. Go ahead.
Tell the cops.
295
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,250
I don't care.
296
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,500
Get out.
Get out of my house.
297
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,250
I want you out! Now!
298
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,500
Stop it, please.
299
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,791
No! Don't!!
300
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:16,791
No!
301
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,041
Fuck!
302
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,791
Aah!
303
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,958
Please, shh.
304
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,833
Please calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.
305
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:32,000
Calm down.
Please, please.
306
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
-Please.
307
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,458
Please.
Please calm down.
308
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,958
Please.
309
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:45,125
Help me!
310
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,750
Please.
311
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:54,791
I'm sorry.
312
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:17,833
You okay?
313
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:26,375
So...
this is where you work?
314
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,333
Yeah.
315
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:41,541
What happened
to your hair?
316
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:46,458
You like it?
317
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:49,125
Yeah, that's fine.
318
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:04,333
Can I go inside?
319
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:06,291
You wanna go inside?
320
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,583
Yeah.
321
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:10,833
Sure.
322
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,291
Now?
323
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:16,416
No, finish your cigarette.
324
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:40,166
Let's go inside.
325
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:58,333
What's that?
326
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:00,583
HIV test.
327
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:06,583
Freaks me out.
328
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,916
Mind if I do it here?
329
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:15,250
No, of course not.
330
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:28,250
I can't understand
this shit.
331
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,791
Let me see.
332
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,375
It's in German.
333
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:38,541
Yeah.
334
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,833
-Are they dry?
-Yeah.
335
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:45,750
-And clean?
-Yeah.
336
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:53,750
Let me see your finger.
337
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,208
You're ready?
338
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:08,458
Yeah.
339
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:09,750
You're sure?
340
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,333
Yeah.
341
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:13,000
Ow.
342
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,208
It's nothing.
343
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,208
Hold still.
344
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,666
Hold still!
345
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:44,208
Hold still.
D-Don't suck on it.
346
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:46,375
Here, hold this.
347
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:21,333
What?
348
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:26,666
I think we're good.
349
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:31,750
Yeah.
350
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,625
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
351
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,625
Fuck!
352
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,458
You gotta go to school.
353
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:03,083
How's Clara?
354
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,583
Laurence: Better.
355
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:17,541
I told her.
356
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:19,666
About her father.
357
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,916
Good.
358
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:26,750
Yeah.
359
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,666
Now she hates him.
360
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:32,916
I'm sure it will pass.
361
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:39,125
She doesn't need
a father like that.
362
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:42,375
Danny: Well...
363
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:45,291
he's the only father
she's got.
364
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:54,125
I feel stupid.
365
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:56,500
Why?
366
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:00,625
For waiting for him
all these years.
367
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:05,125
Telling her
he'd come home one day.
368
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:08,375
Being loyal
is not being stupid.
369
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,458
I'm pretty sure
he misses you now.
370
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:21,291
Laurence: Yeah.
371
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:29,791
He bought this place for us.
372
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,666
Had big dreams.
373
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:36,083
Then he left me
with all these debts.
374
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:38,333
Now I'm stuck here.
375
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:40,875
Stuck.
376
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,791
You gonna go home
one day?
377
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,833
No.
378
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,750
There's nothing but trouble
for me at home.
379
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,125
Looks like trouble
found you here.
380
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:16,625
I don't understand French.
381
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:26,375
That was my dope
in the car!
382
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:29,041
Now you fucking pay me!
383
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,333
I'm just a dishwasher
around here.
384
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:48,750
Get out of here!
385
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,791
Danny:
You should be in bed now.
386
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,708
I think I'm high.
387
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,041
Want some?
388
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,125
Hey. Cover yourself.
Come on, please.
389
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,166
I have to leave.
390
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:06,916
Why?
391
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:12,125
If you leave,
they'll send you back to jail.
392
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:15,875
Don't worry about that.
393
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:20,458
You're like my dad.
394
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:29,458
Maybe you're right.
395
01:16:29,458 --> 01:16:32,083
Or maybe you're wrong.
396
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:35,291
Cause there's just some
people who can't...
397
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:38,250
you can't control,
they won't change.
398
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:43,708
But that doesn't mean they
don't care for you.
399
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,333
You need to go inside.
400
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:02,458
No, it's okay.
401
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:05,208
Come on, get up.
402
01:17:06,916 --> 01:17:08,208
Come on!
403
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:10,291
Go inside!
404
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:18,458
Come on!
405
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:22,500
Stay here, be quiet!
406
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,916
Hey!
407
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:33,125
No!
408
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,541
No.
409
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:47,583
Stop crying.
410
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,958
You're not a kid anymore.
411
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,875
Get in.
