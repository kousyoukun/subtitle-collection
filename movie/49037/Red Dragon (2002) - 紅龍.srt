他不是要收集身體器官
He's not collecting body parts.

I had never heard that expression before, "oysters."

She was missing flesh from her back. And then it hit me.

還沒，我必須先跟你談，但我知道我是對的
No, I needed to see you first. But I'm right. I know I'm right.

對，太棒了
Yeah, it's fascinating.

67
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,465
你知道嗎？我總是很懷疑你能看見某些東西
You know, I'd always suspected as much. You are an eidetiker.

68

More akin to artistic imagination.

你能想像其它人的情緒反應…
You can assume the emotional point of view of others...

72
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,572
即使那些情緒很可怕…或很噁心
even those that might scare or sicken you.

73
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,308
我想這不是一個好的天賦
It's a troubling gift, I should think.

有機會我要好好研究你

在我們共事的這段時間…
and somehow, in all our time together...

這個可能從未發生在你身上
this possibility never occurred to you.

I am only human, Will. Perhaps I made a mistake.

00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,965
對我而言，你一點都不像會犯很多錯的人
You don't strike me as a man who makes very many mistakes.

81
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,598
對不起，現在我…
Now I'm sorry to think I might...

恐怕無法和你一起分享找到自信的喜悅

不，我不是那個意思
No, I didn't say that.

我不知道我在說什麼
I don't know what I'm saying.

00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,873
我想他把手套脫下來，我想他碰過她
I think he took his gloves off. I think he had to touch her.

277
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,270
天啊，威爾
Jesus, Will.

278
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:17,675
（亞特蘭大警局總部）

279
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,407
各位先生，女士
PRINCI: Gentlemen. Ladies.

280
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,779
這是兇手牙齒的樣子
This is what the subject's teeth look like.

281
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:25,216
這個是留在立茲太太身上的咬痕
The impressions came from bite marks on Mrs. Leeds.

282
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,419
這個彎曲的程度…
This degree of crookedness...

283
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,654
加上中間門牙的溝槽…
plus the groove in this central incisor...

284
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,894
讓他的咬痕非常特別
makes his bite signature unique.

285
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,862
他媽的像鯊魚
Fuckin' shark.

286
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:38,058
住嘴！
SPRINGFIELD: Knock it off!

287
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,235
我們很高興有FBI的幫忙
We're grateful to have the FBI.

288
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:43,134
他們在這個領域裡有很多專家
They have a lot of expertise in this area.

289
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:45,229
特別是調查員葛蘭姆
In particular, Investigator Graham does.

290
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:46,672
是吧，傑克？
That right, Jack?

291
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,402
是，長官
Yes, sir.

292
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:51,172
葛蘭姆先生，你有什麼要補充的嗎？
Anything you want to add, Mr. Graham?

293
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,146
請你到前面來好嗎？
COMMISSIONER: Why don't you come on up to the front, please?

294
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,018
就是他   是嗎？
[Cops murmur]

295
00:23:58,086 --> 00:24:00,486
對就是他逮到萊克特
COP 1: That's the guy. COP 2: Was he?

296
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:02,181
我以為他退休了
COP 3: Yeah, that's the guy who arrested Lecter.

297
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:05,158
那個畜牲差一點就把他吃了
COP 4: I thought he retired.

298
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:06,288
COP 5: The son of a bitch just about gutted him.

299
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:13,868
立茲太太和傑科比太太是主要目標
Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi were the primary targets.

300
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,436
其它被殺的人只是為滿足他的幻想
The others were killed just to complete his fantasy.

301
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,770
現在，我知道要接受這個事實對你們很難
WILL: I know that might be hard to accept given what you saw...

302
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,867
但是這不是偶發事件
but this was not random.

303
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:26,937
他不像有些殺人狂，他從來不會失控
This wasn't some killing frenzy. He was never out of control.

304
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:31,174
這些攻擊都是計劃好的，他小心地挑選女人
These attacks were organized, the women carefully chosen.

305
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:33,914
我們不知道他為什麼、又是如何找上她們
We don't know how he's choosing them, or why.

306
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:36,685
她們住在不同州，而且彼此未曾謀面
They lived in different states and never met.

307
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,725
但是還是有一些關聯
But there is some connection.

308
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:41,956
有一些共同的原因，而且是關鍵
There's some common factor, and that's the key.

309
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:45,128
找到這些關鍵因素，我們就能救人
Find out what that is, and we'll save lives.

310
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,533
否則，這種案子會一直持續下去…
'Cause this one is gonna go on and on...

311
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:51,399
除非我們變聰明，或是我們運氣好
until we get smart or we get lucky.

312
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:55,009
他是不會罷休的
He won't stop.

313
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,904
為什麼？　　因為他覺得他是上帝
- Why not? - Because it makes him God.

314
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,406
你會放棄嗎？
Would you give that up?

315
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:07,818
你問到狗，昨晚一個獸醫打電話給我們
You asked about the dog. Last night a vet called us.

316
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,685
立茲和他的大兒子…在他們被殺前的…
Leeds and his oldest boy brought the dog in...

317
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,659
那個下午…帶狗去他那裡
the afternoon before they were killed.

318
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,025
那隻狗的肚子被刺破了
Had a puncture wound to its abdomen.

319
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,859
獸醫只好讓它安樂死
The vet had to put it down.

320
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,263
那隻狗的狗環上有地址嗎？
Was it wearing a collar with the address on it?

321
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:20,925
沒有
No.

322
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,538
傑科比一家有養狗嗎？　　沒有
- Did the Jacobis have a dog? - No dog.

323
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,597
他們在地下室發現了個小箱子…
They found a litter box in the basement...

324
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,041
有貓的糞便，但是沒有貓
cat droppings in it, no cat.

325
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:35,074
如果貓被攻擊了，傑科比一家人可能已經把它埋了
If the cat was attacked, the Jacobis may have buried it.

326
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,347
要伯明翰警局到後院搜尋
Ask Birmingham to check that backyard.

327
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,719
告訴他們…使用甲烷比較快
And tell them to use a methane probe, it's faster.

328
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,910
[Telephone rings]

329
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,122
是的，你的電話
Yeah. It's for you.

330
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:51,725
克勞佛
Crawford.

331
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,635
卡爾，你是我的救星
Carl, you're the light of my life.

332
00:25:57,872 --> 00:25:59,567
這在法院成立嗎？
Would it hold up in court?

333
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,404
太好了
Okay. Great work.

334
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,845
他們在立茲太太的眼睛發現指紋
They found a print on Mrs. Leeds' eye. Partial thumb.

335
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,145
是大拇指的一部份

336
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,884
除此之外，無可奉告
Besides that, there's nothing else to tell you.

337
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,010
謝謝你們
Thank you for your time.

338
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,748
我不能再多說什麼了
COMMISSIONER: I can't answer more questions.

339
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,052
威爾葛蘭姆！記得我嗎？
Will Graham! Remember me?

340
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:20,717
佛瑞迪勞茲，我為《傳聞報》報導萊克特的案子
Freddy Lounds. I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler.

341
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,897
也出了本相關的書   我記得
- Did the paperback. - Yeah, I remember.

342
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:25,660
你何時加入這個案子的？有什麼線索嗎？
When did they bring you in? What've you got?

343
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:29,135
你覺得這個牙仙會比萊克特厲害嗎？
You think the Tooth Fairy will be bigger than Lecter?

344
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,671
我是說，他已經破了萊克特的紀錄…
I mean, he's already beaten Lecter's score...

345
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,732
你寫的儘是些狗屎
You write lying shit, and the Tattler is an asswipe!

346
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,732
《傳聞報》不過用來當衛生紙！

347
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,743
你離我遠一點
You stay away from me.

348
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,841
走開，勞茲
Get away, Lounds.

349
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:42,473
來個獨家怎麼樣？
How about an exclusive?

350
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:46,914
對不起
Sorry about that.

351
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:50,184
這個傢伙溜進醫院拍我
That guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me.

352
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,452
記不記得？我身上插了一堆管子？
Remember? With the tubes hanging out of me?

353
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,119
別理這種人渣
Forget that prick.

354
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,685
給自己一點信心
CRAWFORD: Give yourself some credit.

355
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,527
只要我們逮到那個牙仙…
When we catch the Tooth Fairy...

356
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,261
指紋加上咬痕，一定會讓他定罪
that print plus his teeth will burn him.

357
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,192
你發現的，威爾
You did that, Will.

358
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,295
證據就在那裡，傑克
That evidence was there, Jack.

359
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:08,765
證據就在那裡，給大家看   但沒人看見
- It was there for anyone to see. - But nobody else did.

360
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:11,209
我只是想說，你做得非常好
All I'm sayin' is, that was very good work.

361
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:14,042
不，真正做的好是要看透整件事…
No, good work would be seeing it all the way through...

362
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:15,616
並且逮到他
and catching the guy.

363
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:19,119
我做不到，我只是做到你要我做的
And I can't do that. I did what you asked me to do.

364
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,484
我要回家了
I'm going home.

365
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,386
我甚至完全不知道這個人究竟是誰
I don't even have any idea who this guy is.

366
00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:27,529
我剛剛只是給他們非常粗略的簡報
What I just gave them was broad strokes. He's got no face to me.

367
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:28,979
我想像不出他是怎樣的人

368
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:31,898
你辦葛雷特哈柏的案子時，也是這樣說？
That's what you said about Garrett Hobbs, remember?

369
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,560
然後你弄清楚了   不，我沒有
- And you figured him out. - No, I didn't.

370
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,399
你沒有？　　沒有，我困在哈柏的案子裡
- You didn't? - No, I was stuck on Hobbs.

371
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,102
有人幫我
I had help.

372
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,041
是萊克特
From Lecter.

373
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,740
對
WILL: Yeah.

374
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:58,553
傑克，別和我玩把戲，不要這樣
Jack, don't play games with me. Don't do it.

375
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:01,491
告訴我，你在想什麼
Just tell me what's on your mind.

376
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:02,499
我要說的是…
I'm saying maybe we've got a resource we should look into.

377
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,999
也許從他那裡我們會獲得調查的線索

378
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,590
搞半天這就是你要的？
Is that what this was about?

379
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:08,693
你是不是一開始就想問我？
Did you just want to ask me that all along?

380
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,034
別對我發火，這是我的工作
Don't get mad at me. I'm just doing my job.

381
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:13,505
如果你有快捷方式…讓我知道
If you know a better shortcut, let me know it.

382
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,043
如果你覺得他有任何可能，會對我說…
If you think there's any chance he'll talk to me...

383
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,805
我自己去
I'll go myself.

384
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:23,513
如果你辦不到，我會瞭解的
If you can't handle it, God knows I'd understand that.

385
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:34,684
身為一個研究對象，萊克特讓我們很失望
CHILTON: As a research subject, Lecter has proven most disappointing.

386
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,563
心理測驗對他起不了一點作用
He's simply impenetrable to psychological testing.

387
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:41,427
羅沙哈性格測驗，主題統覺
Rorschach, Thematic Apperception.

388
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,737
他都拿來折紙鶴
He folds them into origami.

389
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,033
（奇爾頓）

390
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:46,801
如你所見
CHILTON: As you see.

391
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:50,040
你的小小造訪在我的同事間…
So you can imagine the stir your little visit...

392
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,341
所帶來的刺激，葛蘭姆先生
is causing among my staff, Mr. Graham.

393
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,912
如果你願意分享一點灼見…
If you'd care to share some insights...

394
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,915
奇爾頓醫師，對不起…
Dr. Chilton, I'm sorry, I've got a 4:17 flight back to Atlanta.

395
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,215
我要趕4點17分的飛機回亞特蘭大

396
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,845
當然
Of course.

397
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:06,655
告訴我，當你看到被萊克特謀殺的人…
Tell me, when you saw Lecter's murders...

398
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,388
他們的樣子，所以…
their style, so to speak...

399
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:11,921
你有可能重建他的幻想世界嗎？
were you able, perhaps, to reconstruct his fantasies?

400
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,969
如果有，你有記下任何東西嗎？
And, if so, did you jot down any impressions?

401
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:16,627
沒有
WILL: No.

402
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,509
坦白說，葛蘭姆先生
Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.

403
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,614
萊克特的第一手分析資料
The first analysis of Lecter will be a publisher's wet dream.

404
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,914
是出版商夢寐以求的內容

405
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,612
我會歸功於你，當然
I'd give you full credit, of course.

406
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:39,951
該死，你一定有些建議，你逮到他的
Damn it, man. You must have some advice. You caught him.

407
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,996
你怎麼辦到的？
What was your trick?

408

00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:24,779
除了一兩件奈爾傑柯比拿走要當紀念的東西之外
one or two little keepsakes Niles Jacobi got.

814
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:28,088
那是傑柯比倖存的兒子，他和前妻生的？
That would be Mr. Jacobi's surviving son by his first wife?

815
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,727
對，身為他們的法定代理人
Yes. As their executor, I keep all that stuff in the office...

816
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:31,577
我把所有東西留在辦公室…

817
00:57:31,598 --> 00:57:35,557
包括一些值錢的小東西，直到遺囑公證之後
along with some of the smaller valuables, till after probate.

818
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,535
但伯明翰警察局已經搜過所有的東西
But the Birmingham P.D.'s been all through it.

819
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:41,199
你可以把那些東西寄給我嗎？
Could you pack those things and ship them up to me?

820
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,406
我不喜歡這樣，我知道這樣很麻煩
I hate to ask. I know it's a pain in the ass.

821
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,612
管他的…
Hell...

822
00:57:52,952 --> 00:57:56,080
遺囑公證的法官…是我的高爾夫老球友
probate judge is an old golfing buddy of mine.

823
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:02,154
告訴我你會逮到那個畜牲
Son, just tell me you're gonna nail that son of a bitch.

824
00:58:02,328 --> 00:58:02,953
我們會盡力
We're doing our best.

825
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,924
謝謝，麥考夫先生
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.

826
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,092
萊克特的牢房裡藏了一張紙條
A note hidden in Lecter's cell. Sounds like a fan letter.

827
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,092
似乎是仰慕者的信

828
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:11,832
可能來自牙仙
Might've been mailed by the Tooth Fairy.

829
00:58:11,904 --> 00:58:13,428
他想要萊克特的認同
He wants Lecter's approval.

830
00:58:13,506 --> 00:58:15,838
他對你很好奇，他問了很多問題
He's curious about you. He's asking questions.

831
00:58:15,908 --> 00:58:17,671
我已經準備了一輛直升機
I've scrambled a chopper.

832
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,268
萊克特知道了嗎？
Does Lecter know we have the note?

833
00:58:19,345 --> 00:58:21,540
還不知道，那是在例行的清潔工作中發現的
CRAWFORD: Not yet. It was found in a routine cleanup.

834
00:58:21,614 --> 00:58:23,047
他們不拆他的郵件？
WILL: They don't open his mail?

835
00:58:23,116 --> 00:58:25,016
要有搜索令，只能用X光檢查
CRAWFORD: Need a warrant. X-rays only.

836
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,018
萊克特現在在哪裡？　　在禁閉室
WILL: Where's Lecter? CRAWFORD: The holding cage.

837
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,553
他看得到牢房嗎？
WILL: Can he see his cell?

838
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:31,112
看不到，但他幾乎被綁了半小時了
CRAWFORD: No. But he's been there almost half an hour.

839
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,851
他很快就會發現事情不對勁
He'll soon start to wonder what's wrong.

840
00:58:32,925 --> 00:58:34,984
我們要爭取時間
We got to buy time, Jack.

841
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:39,555
奇爾頓醫師   哪位？
CRAWFORD: Dr. Chilton. CHILTON: Yes?

842
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:41,259
通知大樓管理處…
Call your building superintendent...

843
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,165
或工程師，反正是負責人就行
or engineer, whoever's in charge.

844
00:58:43,236 --> 00:58:45,761
把萊克特牢房走廊的保險絲剪斷
Tell him to pull the circuit breakers on Lecter's hall.

845
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:48,864
要工程人員帶著工具，穿過走道…
Have the super walk down the hall past the cell...

846
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:49,964
經過牢房
carrying tools.

847
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:54,446
他要很生氣、很著急，忙得沒空回答問題
He'll be in a hurry, pissed off, too busy to answer questions.

848
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:58,111
而且不要忘記：不要碰那張紙條，行嗎？
And don't forget: Don't touch the note, okay?

849
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,252
葛蘭姆就在路上
Graham's on his way.

850
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:04,150
聽著！這是緊急狀況，我們會拿到一張紙條…
Listen up! We've got a note coming in on the fly...

851
00:59:04,257 --> 00:59:08,284
很可能來自牙仙，非常重要
possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number One Priority.

852
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:11,286
紙條必須在一小時內送回萊克特的牢房…
It has to go back to Lecter's cell within the hour...

853
00:59:11,364 --> 00:59:12,956
不准動手腳
unmarked.

854

我們需要頭髮和纖維鑒驗部門…
We'll need Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints, then Documents.

855
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:17,332
潛在指紋檢查和文件

我會親自監督，大家現在就行動！
I'll walk it through myself. Let's go, people!

[Dramatic instrumental music]

858
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:28,548
我親愛的萊克特醫師：我想告訴你我很高興…
DOLARHYDE [Voice-over]: My dear Dr. Lecter.: I wanted to tell you...

859
00:59:28,548 --> 00:59:30,812
你對我有興趣
I'm delighted...

860
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:35,183
當我知道你的反應時，我想…
that you've taken an interest in me.

861
00:59:32,014 --> 00:59:36,314
And when I learned of your vast correspondence, I thought.:

862
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,620
「我敢嗎？」當然
"Dare I?" Of course I do.

863
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:43,093
我不相信…你會告訴他們我是誰
I don't believe you'll tell them who I am.

864
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,893
何況，我目前的軀體雖然是平凡的
Besides, what particular body I currently occupy is trivial.

865
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:49,991
重要的是我即將蛻變
The important thing is what I am becoming.

866
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:54,303
我知道…只有你可以瞭解這種轉型
I know that you alone can understand this transformation.

867
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:57,676
有一些東西我很希望你能看見
I have some things I'd love to show you.

868
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:01,302
如果情況許可，我希望能與你合作
If circumstances permit, I hope we can correspond.

869
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,406
多年來我一直很景仰你…
I have admired you for years and have...

870
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:06,748
我有你完整的剪報
a complete collection of your press notices.

871
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,913
事實上，我認為他們對你的報導不公平
Actually, I think of them as unfair reviews.

872
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,487
對我也是
As unfair as mine.

873
01:00:13,226 --> 01:00:16,855
他們喜歡亂取一些低俗的綽號，不是嗎？
They do like to sling demeaning nicknames, don't they?

874
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:20,655
還有什麼比「牙仙」更不恰當的？
"The Tooth Fairy. " What could be more inappropriate?

875
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:24,194
如果不是因為你也有同樣的遭遇…
It would shame me for you to read that, if I didn't know...

876
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:27,034
我會因為你讀到這些報導覺得丟臉
you had suffered the same distortions in the press.

877
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:29,734
我受夠了這棟該死的的建築！
I'm fed up with this bloody stupid building!

每天都有東西壞掉
Every day something breaking.

可能就是被萊克特撕掉的部份
were probably in the section Lecter tore out.

883
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:43,587
為什麼不乾脆整個丟掉？
Why not just throw the whole note away?

884
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:45,350
裡面全是讚美

These could be the tips of "T's" here and here.

892
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,747
句尾是「P」，也有可能是「R」
On the end, that's a "P, " or possibly an "R."

893
01:01:10,817 --> 01:01:13,718
也許這裡…是他告訴萊克特怎麼響應他的地方
Maybe this is where he's telling Lecter how to answer him.

他在紙條裡提到，是嗎？
That's in his note, right?

- You got what? News stories. - Personals.

903
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:35,872

Maybe he wants Lecter to answer him through the personals?

原諒我寫在捲筒衛生紙上
Forgive the stationery.

he knew Lecter would have it in his cell.

我在這裡做什麼？
What am I doing here?

1082
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:53,274
贖罪，勞茲先生
DOLARHYDE: Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

1083
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,311
我還沒看到你的臉
LOUNDS: I haven't seen your face.

我不可能認出你
I couldn't possibly identify you.

我在《國家傳聞報》工作
I work for the National Tattler.

你會得到…
It would pay...

1087
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,334
很豐厚的贖金
a big reward for me.

我說的是50萬…
I mean, a half a million...

也許是100萬

01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,306
你知道我是誰嗎？勞茲先生

不知道
No.

相信我，你知道

1094
01:13:26,952 --> 01:13:30,854
根據你的描述，我是個邪惡的不正常的性無能…

我不是人

Okay? I mean, Lounds, that was a bonus.
