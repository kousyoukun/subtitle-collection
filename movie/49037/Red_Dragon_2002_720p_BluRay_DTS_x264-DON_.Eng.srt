I've always tried to hang on to what that cougar looked like.

718
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:18,330
But by now, to tell the truth, what I see in my head...

719
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:20,558
is probably not in the least bit like a cougar.

720
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:22,794
It's more like a donkey or a goat.

721
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,666
You know, sometimes I'm not so sure I really saw him.

722
00:55:25,772 --> 00:55:28,570

No, I guess not.
