00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,931
Baltimore, Md 1980

2
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:07,136
LECTER: "Think to yourself that every day is your last...

3
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,401
"the hour to which you do not look forward...

4
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,640
"will come as a welcome surprise.

5
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,214
"As for me...

6
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:14,716
"when you want a good laugh...

7
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:17,378
"you will find me, in a fine state...

8
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,645
"fat and sleek...

9
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:22,814
"a true hog of Epicurus' herd."

10
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,056
And we find

11
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:29,656
 you cribbing lines from Horace, as well.

12
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,199
Well done, John.

13
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:32,996
I must say, Hannibal...

14
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,860
speaking for the rest of the herd...

15
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:38,832
I'm sorry, for the Symphony Board...

16
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,274
that these little soirees of yours...

17
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:43,676
are always the highlight of our year.

18
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,338
- Just so. - You're too kind.

19
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:51,484
I do feel guilty enjoying tonight when a musician is...

20
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,578
still listed as a missing person.

21
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:55,624
Yes, poor fellow.

22
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,452
MAN: Shall I confess something wicked?

23
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:03,591
I can't help feeling the tiniest bit... relieved.

24
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:06,795
It sounds awful, I know.

25
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:10,361
But, let's face it, so does the man's playing.

26
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,508
Hannibal, confess.

27
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,569
What is this divine-looking amuse-bouche?

28
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,814
If I tell you...

29
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:22,612
I'm afraid you won't even try it.

30
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,950
- Bon appetit. - Bon appetit.

31
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,635
Special Agent Graham. What an unexpected pleasure.

32
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,908
I'm sorry to bother you again, Dr. Lecter. 

33
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:51,908
I know it's late.

34
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,144
It's no bother. We're both night owls, I think.

35
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,577
- Come in, please. - Thank you.

36
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,712
Let me take your coat.

37
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,855
LECTER: What's on your mind?

38
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:05,860
We've been on the wrong track this whole time. You and I.

39
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,156
Our whole profile's wrong.

40
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:11,060
We've been looking for someone with a crazy grudge...

41
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,294
and some kind of anatomical knowledge.

42
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:16,445
Decertified doctors, med school dropouts...

43
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,962
laid-off mortuary workers...

44
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,771
From the precision of the cuts, and his choice of souvenirs.

45
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,368
That's where we're off-target.

46
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:25,676
He's not collecting body parts.

47
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:29,843
- Then why keep them? - He's not. He's eating them.

48
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:34,284
No, listen. We were at Molly's parents' for New Year's...

49
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,324
and her dad was showing my son, Josh...

50
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,292
how to carve a roasted chicken.

51
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:41,295
He said, "The tenderest part of the chicken is the oysters...

52
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:43,422
"on either side of the back."

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,636
I had never heard that expression before, "oysters."

54
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,966
Then suddenly I had a flash of the third victim...

55
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,769
Darcy Taylor.

56
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,243
She was missing flesh from her back. And then it hit me.

57
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:00,509
Liver, kidney, tongue, thymus.

58
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,246
Every single victim lost some body part used in cooking.

59
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,681
Have you shared this with the Bureau?

60
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:11,386
No, I needed to see you first. But I'm right. I know I'm right.

61
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:13,895
I'm starting to be able to think like this one.

62
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,726
Yeah, it's fascinating.

63
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,465
You know, I'd always suspected as much. You are an eidetiker.

64
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,794
I'm not psychic, Doctor.

65
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:24,806
No, this is different.

66
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,132
More akin to artistic imagination.

67
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:30,946
You can assume the emotional point of view of others...

68
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,572
even those that might scare or sicken you.

69
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,308
It's a troubling gift, I should think.

70
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,047
How I'd love to get you on my couch.

71
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,555
Something still doesn't make sense to me.

72
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,821
You're the best forensic psychiatrist I know...

73
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,553
and somehow, in all our time together...

74
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,929
this possibility never occurred to you.

75
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:55,226
I am only human, Will. Perhaps I made a mistake.

76
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,965
You don't strike me as a man who makes very many mistakes.

77
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,598
Now I'm sorry to think I might...

78
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:03,372
no longer enjoy your full confidence.

79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,446
No, I didn't say that.

80
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,681
I don't know what I'm saying.

81
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:13,018
I'm very, very tired.

82
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,627
I almost had it.

83
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,195
It'll come to you.

84
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,690
Why don't you come back in the morning?

85
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,996
I'll clear some time on my schedule and...

86
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:28,696
then we can get started in revising our profile.

87
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,465
LECTER: Sound good? WILL: Yeah.

88
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,100
LECTER: Rest here, and I'll get your coat.

89
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:36,106
Won't be a tick.

90
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,501


91
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:29,530


92
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,564
Don't move.

93
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:42,268
You're in shock now. I don't want you to feel any pain.

94
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:46,576
In a moment you'll begin to be light-headed. Then drowsy.

95
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:51,013
Don't resist. It's so gentle. Like slipping into a warm bath.

96
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,349
I regret it came to this, Will.

97
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:58,723
But every game must have its ending.

98
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,595
LECTER: Remarkable boy.

99
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,728
I do admire your courage.

100
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,170
I think I'll eat your heart.

101
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:52,170


102
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:57,170


103
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:04,556


104
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:08,556


105
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,156


106
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:15,170


107
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,266


108
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:24,870


109
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,275


110
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,951


111
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:38,457


112
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,461


113
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,458


114
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,229


115
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,429


116
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,802


117
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,677


118
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,701


119
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,065


120
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,837


121
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:32,540


122
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,115


123
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,810


124
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,944


125
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,051


126
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:55,030


127
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,077


128
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,706


129
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,724


130
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,724
Marathon, FI Several Years Later

131
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,237
JOSH: Hey, Dad. Someone's here.

132
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,941
Hey.

133
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,785
CRAWFORD: You've got a beautiful setup here, Will.

134
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,790
WILL: Yeah, it's good.

135
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:54,027
- You know why I'm here? - Yeah, I can guess.

136
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:56,721
How much do you know?

137
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,362
Just what was in the Miami Herald and the Times.

138
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,768
Two families killed a month apart in their homes.

139
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:07,872
Birmingham and Atlanta. The circumstances were similar.

140
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:11,039
Not similar. The same.

141
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,707
What have you kept out of the papers?

142
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:16,580
He smashes mirrors and uses the pieces.

143
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:20,951
Wears latex gloves, so we've got no prints. Size 11 shoe.

144
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:24,242
He's not too comfortable with locks.

145
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,194
Pried open a patio door in Birmingham...

146
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,423
used a glass cutter in Atlanta.

147
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:31,326
And his blood's AB positive.

148
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,128
- Somebody hurt him? - Nope.

149
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,428
We typed him from semen and saliva. He's a secretor.

150
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,309
Tell me something, Will. You knew what this was.

151
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,244
Did you ever consider picking up the phone and giving me a call?

152
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,718
You've got all the people you need.

153
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:55,655
You've got Dortmund at Harvard. You got Bloom in Chicago.

154
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:58,022
I've got you down here fixing boat motors?

155
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,527
Yeah, I like fixing boat motors.

156
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,565
I wouldn't be very useful to you.

157
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:05,065
I don't think about it anymore.

158
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,796
Really? The last two we had, you caught.

159
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,532
By doing what you and the other guys are doing.

160
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,107
That's not entirely true. It's the way you think.

161
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:16,838
Come on. There's been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.

162
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:19,141
I've got technicians to examine evidence...

163
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:20,613
but you've got that other thing.

164
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:23,982
Imagination. Projection. Whatever.

165
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:27,882
- I know you don't like it. - You wouldn't like it, either.

166
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:52,442
This freak killed the Jacobis in Birmingham...

167
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:54,948
on Saturday night, February 25. Full moon.

168
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,179
He killed the Leeds family in Atlanta...

169
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:58,814
a few nights ago, March 28.

170
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,345
One day short of a lunar month.

171
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,947
If we're lucky, we may have a little over three weeks...

172
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,152
before he does it again.

173
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:07,525
Will, do you respect my judgment?

174
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:10,425
Of course.

175
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:14,026
I think we have a better chance to catch him fast if you help.

176
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,729
Go to Atlanta and look. Just look.

177
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,033
Then help me brief the locals. That's it.

178
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,301
MOLLY: Crawford has the whole damn government.

179
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:24,676
Why does he need you?

180
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:27,409
He just wants me to look at some evidence, Molly.

181
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,780
Give him another point of view.

182
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,615
It's a few days, a week maybe, and I'll be right back.

183
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:35,952
- And you believed that? - Yes.

184
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,187
These kinds of cases come up very rarely...

185
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,661
and I've had experience.

186
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,425
Yes, you have.

187
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,059
You're paid up, Will.

188
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,065
All of us. Even Josh.

189
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,403
There's a chance I could help them save some lives.

190
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,037
How do I say no to that?

191
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:09,383
This one will never see me or know my name.

192
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,228
I'll just help them find him.

193
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,525
The cops will take him down, not me.

194
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:23,533
I'll be in the back of the pack, Molly, I promise.

195
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,505
Never in your life.

196
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,477
- I know you. - Come on. Come here.

197
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:38,719
WILL: I love you.

198
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:41,017
WILL: See you in a few days. JOSH: Okay.

199
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,458
WILL: I'll call you tonight.

200
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,103
JOSH: 'Bye, Dad!

201
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:10,482
Leeds House, Atlanta, Ga

202
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:33,297
Where's the dog? No one heard barking.

203
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,573
There's nothing about it in the case file.

204
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:49,003
The intruder enters in the dark and cuts Charles Leeds' throat.

205
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:52,280
He shoots Valerie Leeds in the stomach as she's rising...

206
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:54,781
disabling her but not killing her.

207
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,885
He leaves her to watch her husband die...

208
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:01,846
then turns and goes down the hall.

209
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,983
The children were...

210
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:35,149
The children were still in bed when they were shot...

211
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:38,317
which might indicate that he used a silencer.

212
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:50,099
He dragged the bodies into the master bedroom, but why?

213
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,400
They were already dead and none of them got the same...

214
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:58,040
extra attention as Mrs. Leeds.

215
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,401
Small pieces of mirror were inserted...

216
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,141
in the orbital sockets of the victims.

217
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:35,641
This occurred post-mortem.

218
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:49,123
Why did you put mirrors in their eyes?

219
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,427


220
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,295
The pieces of mirror

221
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:03,695
 are to make their eyes look alive!

222
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:07,368
He wanted an audience. He wanted them all lined up...

223
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:09,967
watching him when he touched her.

224
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,745
When he touched her.

225
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:20,751
Touched. Talcum powder.

226
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,881
There was talcum powder.

227
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,458


228
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:29,497
WILL: "Mrs. Leeds had traces of talcum on her right inner thigh.

229
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:30,861
"A complete search of the home...

230
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,730
"led to no such matching talcum in the house."

231
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,270
You took your gloves off, didn't you? You son of a bitch!

232
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,301
You took your gloves off, touched her...

233
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:44,106
with your bare hand and wiped her down.

234
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:48,205
But when the gloves were off, did you open her eyes?

235
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:56,346
Crawford.

236
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:59,120
WILL: Are the Leeds' bodies still at the morgue?

237
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,524
Who's good with latent prints here?

238
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:02,790
CRAWFORD: Atlanta P.D.

239
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:04,525
They've already printed the bodies.

240
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,965
Not the bodies. Tell them to check the eyes.

241
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,595
Mrs. Leeds' eyes. Even her corneas.

242
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,873
I think he took his gloves off. I think he had to touch her.

243
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,270
Jesus, Will.

244
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:17,675


245
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,407
PRINCl: Gentlemen. Ladies.

246
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,779
This is what the subject's teeth look like.

247
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:25,216
The impressions came from bite marks on Mrs. Leeds.

248
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,419
This degree of crookedness...

249
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,654
plus the groove in this central incisor...

250
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,894
makes his bite signature unique.

251
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,862
Fuckin' shark.

252
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:38,058
SPRINGFIELD: Knock it off!

253
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,235
We're grateful to have the FBI.

254
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:43,134
They have a lot of expertise in this area.

255
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:45,229
In particular, Investigator Graham does.

256
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:46,672
That right, Jack?

257
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,402
Yes, sir.

258
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:51,172
Anything you want to add, Mr. Graham?

259
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,146
COMMISSIONER: Why don't you come on up to the front, please?

260
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,018
COP 1: That's the guy. COP 2: Was he?

261
00:23:58,086 --> 00:24:00,486
COP 3: Yeah, that's the guy who arrested Lecter.

262
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:02,181
COP 4: I thought he retired.

263
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:05,158
COP 5: The son of a bitch just about gutted him.

264
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:13,868
Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi were the primary targets.

265
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,436
The others were killed just to complete his fantasy.

266
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,770
WILL: I know that might be hard to accept given what you saw...

267
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,867
but this was not random.

268
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:26,937
This wasn't some killing frenzy. He was never out of control.

269
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:31,174
These attacks were organized, the women carefully chosen.

270
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:33,914
We don't know how he's choosing them, or why.

271
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:36,685
They lived in different states and never met.

272
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,725
But there is some connection.

273
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:41,956
There's some common factor, and that's the key.

274
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:45,128
Find out what that is, and we'll save lives.

275
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,533
'Cause this one is gonna go on and on...

276
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:51,399
until we get smart or we get lucky.

277
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:55,009
He won't stop.

278
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,904
- Why not? - Because it makes him God.

279
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,406
Would you give that up?

280
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:07,818
You asked about the dog. Last night a vet called us.

281
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,685
Leeds and his oldest boy brought the dog in...

282
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,659
the afternoon before they were killed.

283
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,025
Had a puncture wound to its abdomen.

284
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,859
The vet had to put it down.

285
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,263
Was it wearing a collar with the address on it?

286
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:20,925
No.

287
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,538
- Did the Jacobis have a dog? - No dog.

288
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,597
They found a litter box in the basement...

289
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,041
cat droppings in it, no cat.

290
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:35,074
If the cat was attacked, the Jacobis may have buried it.

291
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,347
Ask Birmingham to check that backyard.

292
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,719
And tell them to use a methane probe, it's faster.

293
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,122
Yeah. It's for you.

294
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:51,725
Crawford.

295
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,635
Carl, you're the light of my life.

296
00:25:57,872 --> 00:25:59,567
Would it hold up in court?

297
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,404
Okay. Great work.

298
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,845
They found a print on Mrs. Leeds' eye. 

299
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,145
Partial thumb.

300
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,884
Besides that, there's nothing else to tell you.

301
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,010
Thank you for your time.

302
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,748
COMMISSIONER: I can't answer more questions.

303
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,052
Will Graham! Remember me?

304
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:20,717
Freddy Lounds. I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler.

305
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,897
- Did the paperback. - Yeah, I remember.

306
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:25,660
When did they bring you in? What've you got?

307
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:29,135
You think the Tooth Fairy will be bigger than Lecter?

308
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,671
I mean, he's already beaten Lecter's score...

309
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,732
You write lying shit,

310
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,732
 and the Tattler is an asswipe!

311
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,743
You stay away from me.

312
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,841
Get away, Lounds.

313
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:42,473
How about an exclusive?

314
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:46,914
Sorry about that.

315
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:50,184
That guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me.

316
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,452
Remember? With the tubes hanging out of me?

317
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,119
Forget that prick.

318
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,685
CRAWFORD: Give yourself some credit.

319
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,527
When we catch the Tooth Fairy...

320
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,261
that print plus his teeth will burn him.

321
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,192
You did that, Will.

322
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,295
That evidence was there, Jack.

323
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:08,765
- It was there for anyone to see. - But nobody else did.

324
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:11,209
All I'm sayin' is, that was very good work.

325
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:14,042
No, good work would be seeing it all the way through...

326
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:15,616
and catching the guy.

327
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:19,119
And I can't do that. I did what you asked me to do.

328
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,484
I'm going home.

329
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,386
I don't even have any idea who this guy is.

330
00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:27,529
What I just gave them was broad strokes. 

331
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:28,979
He's got no face to me.

332
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:31,898
That's what you said about Garrett Hobbs, remember?

333
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,560
- And you figured him out. - No, I didn't.

334
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,399
- You didn't? - No, I was stuck on Hobbs.

335
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,102
I had help.

336
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,041
From Lecter.

337
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,740
WILL: Yeah.

338
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:58,553
Jack, don't play games with me. Don't do it.

339
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:01,491
Just tell me what's on your mind.

340
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:02,499
I'm saying 

341
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,999
maybe we've got a resource we should look into.

342
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,590
Is that what this was about?

343
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:08,693
Did you just want to ask me that all along?

344
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,034
Don't get mad at me. I'm just doing my job.

345
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:13,505
If you know a better shortcut, let me know it.

346
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,043
If you think there's any chance he'll talk to me...

347
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,805
I'll go myself.

348
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:23,513
If you can't handle it, God knows I'd understand that.

349
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:34,684
CHILTON: As a research subject, Lecter has proven most disappointing.

350
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,563
He's simply impenetrable to psychological testing.

351
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:41,427
Rorschach, Thematic Apperception.

352
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,737
He folds them into origami.

353
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,033


354
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:46,801
CHILTON: As you see.

355
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:50,040
So you can imagine the stir your little visit...

356
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,341
is causing among my staff, Mr. Graham.

357
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,912
If you'd care to share some insights...

358
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,915
Dr. Chilton, I'm sorry, 

359
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,215
I've got a 4:17 flight back to Atlanta.

360
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,845
Of course.

361
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:06,655
Tell me, when you saw Lecter's murders...

362
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,388
their style, so to speak...

363
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:11,921
were you able, perhaps, to reconstruct his fantasies?

364
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,969
And, if so, did you jot down any impressions?

365
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:16,627
WILL: No.

366
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,509
Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.

367
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,614
The first analysis of Lecter 

368
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,914
will be a publisher's wet dream.

369
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,612
I'd give you full credit, of course.

370
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:39,951
Damn it, man. You must have some advice. You caught him.

371
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,996
What was your trick?

372
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:44,864
I let him kill me.

373
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:41,981
LECTER: That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court.

374
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,659
I keep getting it for Christmas.

375
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:49,686
LECTER: Christmas, yes. Did you get my card?

376
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:52,596
I got it, thank you.

377
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:56,000
LECTER: So nice of the Bureau's crime lab to forward that.

378
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,006
They wouldn't give me your home address.

379
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:03,938
Dr. Bloom sent me your article on surgical addiction...

380
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:06,513
in the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry.

381
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:08,208
LECTER: And?

382
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:11,076
Very interesting, even to a layman.

383
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,249
You say you're a layman.

384
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:29,434
But it was you who caught me. Wasn't it, Will?

385
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:35,599
LECTER: Do you know how you did it? WILL: I got lucky.

386
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,076
I don't think you believe that.

387
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,514
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?

388
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:43,914
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

389
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:46,486
I need your advice, Dr. Lecter.

390
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,054
LECTER: Birmingham and Atlanta.

391
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:54,957
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?

392
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:57,997
I thought you'd have ideas. I want you to tell me them.

393
00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:59,430
Why should I?

394
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,899
There are things you don't have.

395
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:03,630
Research materials. Maybe even computer access.

396
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:05,535
I'd speak to the Chief of Staff.

397
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:07,574
Yes, Dr. Chilton.

398
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,405
Gruesome, isn't he?

399
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:12,354
He fumbles at your head 

400
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:14,944
like a freshman pulling at panties.

401
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,678
If you recall, Will...

402
00:32:17,752 --> 00:32:20,243
our last collaboration ended rather messily.

403
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:25,619
You'd get to see the file on this case.

404
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,421
- And there's another reason. - I'm all ears.

405
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:32,498
I thought you might enjoy the challenge.

406
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:35,534
Find out if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.

407
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,643
Then, by implication, you think you're smarter than I am...

408
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,875
since it was you who caught me.

409
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,916
I know I'm not smarter than you.

410
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:52,919
Then how did you catch me?

411
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:55,512
You had disadvantages.

412
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:57,654
What disadvantages?

413
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,786
You're insane.

414
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:07,126
You're very tanned, Will.

415
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:10,963
And your hands are so rough. Not like a cop's hands anymore.

416
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,166
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.

417
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,336
Has a little ship on the bottle, does it not?

418
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:20,981
And how is young Josh and the lovely Molly?

419
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:24,216
They're always in my thoughts, you know.

420
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:26,309
You will not persuade me with appeals...

421
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:27,854
to my intellectual vanity.

422
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,787
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.

423
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:31,654
You'll either do it or you won't.

424
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:34,286
LECTER: Is that the case file? WILL: Yes.

425
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,590
With photos?

426
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:37,927
Let me keep them, and I might consider it.

427
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,489
No.

428
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:44,227
Do you dream much, Will?

429
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:45,862
Goodbye, Dr. Lecter.

430
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,239
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet!

431
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,401
Give me the file, then!

432
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,347
And I'll tell you what I think.

433
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,420
I'll need one hour. And privacy.

434
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,527
Just like old times, Will?

435
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,951
LECTER: This is a very shy boy, Will.

436
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:44,059
I'd love to meet him.

437
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:47,225
Have you considered that he is disfigured...

438
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:49,428
or that he may believe he is disfigured?

439
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:51,061
Yeah, the mirrors.

440
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:53,106
Notice he smashes all the mirrors...

441
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,301
not just enough to get the pieces he wants.

442
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,707
And, of course, those shards in their eyes...

443
00:34:57,778 --> 00:34:59,177
so he can see himself there.

444
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:00,441
That's interesting.

445
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,675
No, it's not. You thought of it before.

446
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,217
I had considered it.

447
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:07,413
- What about the women? - Dead?

448
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:09,046
Mere puppets.

449
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:12,756
You need to see them living, the way they caught his eye.

450
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:14,021
That's impossible.

451
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:16,063
Almost. Not quite.

452
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:19,624
What were the yards like?

453
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:24,695
Big backyards, fenced, some hedges. Why?

454
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:26,629
Because if this pilgrim...

455
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,800
feels a special relationship with the moon...

456
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,674
he might like to go outside and look at it.

457
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:33,713
You ever seen blood in the moonlight?

458
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:35,715
It appears quite black.

459
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,442
If one were nude, say, it'd be better to have...

460
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,681
outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.

461
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:45,121
You think the yards are a factor when he selects victims?

462
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,591
Yes.

463
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:50,062
And there will be more of them, of course. Victims.

464
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:53,765
You'll be wanting lots of these little chinwags...

465
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,563
- I take it. - I might not have time.

466
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,001
I do.

467
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,629
I have oodles.

468
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:00,765
I need your opinion now.

469
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:02,502
Then here's one:

470
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,379
You stink of fear under that cheap lotion.

471
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,745
You stink of fear, Will, but you're not a coward!

472
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,343
You fear me, but still you came here.

473
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:17,913
You fear this shy boy, yet still you seek him out.

474
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,088
Don't you understand, Will?

475
00:36:22,563 --> 00:36:25,555
You caught me because we're very much alike.

476
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:28,691
Without our imaginations...

477
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,602
we'd be like all those other poor dullards.

478
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:39,103
Fear is the price of our instrument.

479
00:36:39,413 --> 00:36:41,381
But I can help you bear it.

480
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,552
- You getting his face? - Yeah.

481
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:56,459
Okay, you got it?

482
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,088
All right, let's get the fuck out of here.

483
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,497
CRAWFORD: Sure you're okay?

484
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,331
Yeah, I'm okay.

485
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:05,236
CRAWFORD: What do you think he meant by "see them living"?

486
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,866
I don't know, maybe nothing.

487
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,307
It's hard to separate his bullshit.

488
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:13,539
But I'm gonna make another pass at the Leeds' house.

489
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,148


490
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:49,840


491
00:37:50,317 --> 00:37:51,875


492
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,012


493
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,213


494
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,958


495
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,653


496
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:02,922


497
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,631
CHARLES: All right, Duchess, doll. That's it.

498
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:09,862
Show me what you can do.

499
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:15,302
Who's that? Get them, Duchess. Get them, Duch! Go get them!

500
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,977
Go get them, girl!

501
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:18,977
Okay.

502
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,411
CHARLES: And action!

503
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:22,506
Charles! What are you doing?

504
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:24,147
CHARLES: Hey, gang.

505
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,549
VALERIE: You crazy man.

506
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,610
CHARLES: How is everybody doing?

507
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:29,383
VALERIE: Just home from the store.

508
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:31,118
SUSIE: Hi, Daddy. CHARLES: That's my girl.

509
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:33,524
SEAN: Hi, Daddy. CHARLES: Hi, honey. Billy?

510
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:34,652
Hi, Dad.

511
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:36,252
CHARLES: And sweetie?

512
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,493
I am not ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.

513
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,029
What do you think?

514
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:46,131
Get closer. Get closer. Little closer.

515
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,537
I think we'd better put these kids to bed early tonight.

516
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:52,077
VALERIE: They seem tired. Don't you think?

517
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,344
CHARLES: Here we are at the pool party.

518
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,247
What are you doing? Stop it!

519
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:59,479
You stop it! I'm telling my mother on you.

520
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:01,316
CHARLES: Now I get my kiss?

521
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:05,518
- All right, you want a kiss? - I want one. The romantic kind.

522
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,657
Jacobi House, Birmingham, Al

523
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:25,201
Won't nobody get in through here again. I'll guaran-damn-tee it.

524
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,748
Why didn't he break in down there? It's more hidden.

525
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:33,911
Hell, that door's got deadbolts.

526
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,080
Reckon he was in too big a hurry.

527
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:39,585
No, this one doesn't hurry.

528
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,783
You sat right here, didn't you?

529
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,749
You watched the children bury the cat.

530
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:43,119
And then you waited for dark.

531
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,477
WILL: You're proud. You had to sign your work.

532
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,783


533
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,976
YOUNG DOLARHYDE: Grandma? Grandma?

534
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:47,452
I'm sorry.

535
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:52,185
GRANDMA: I've never seen a child as dirty and disgusting as you.

536
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,194
Look at you! You're soaking wet. Get out of my bed.

537
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,560
YOUNG DOLARHYDE: No. GRANDMA: Go back to your room.

538
00:41:58,032 --> 00:41:59,590
YOUNG DOLARHYDE: You're hurting me!

539
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,931
GRANDMA: Shut up, you filthy little beast!

540
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:05,199
I should have put you in an orphanage, grandson or not.

541
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:09,106
DOLARHYDE: Grandma, don't hurt me.

542
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,504
You're hurting me!

543
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:11,805
GRANDMA: Into the bathroom!

544
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:15,679
Take off your nightshirt, and wipe yourself off. Hurry up!

545
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:19,611
Now give me my scissors from the medicine chest.

546
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:20,949
DOLARHYDE: Please, no!

547
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,581
GRANDMA: Take that filthy thing in your hand. Stretch it out.

548
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:24,817
DOLARHYDE: No, Grandma.

549
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:26,223
GRANDMA: Now! DOLARHYDE: Please!

550
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,126
GRANDMA: Look down. Do you want me to cut it off? Do you?

551
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:30,560
DOLARHYDE: No, Grandma!

552
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,496
GRANDMA: I pledge you my word, Francis...

553
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,557
if you ever make your bed dirty again...

554
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,535
I'll cut it off. Do you understand?

555
00:42:36,603 --> 00:42:40,903
DOLARHYDE: I'll be a good boy. I promise.

556
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:23,280


557
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:31,120


558
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:47,039


559
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:49,405


560
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:52,669


561
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:39,087
Good morning, Will.

562
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:41,558
So nice of you to visit again.

563
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:46,860
He carved this on a tree near the Jacobi house.

564
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:48,634
With a Buck knife.

565
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:51,000
The same one later used on Charles Leeds.

566
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,561
Yes.

567
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,374
LECTER: Take a walk with me.

568
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,915
WILL: He had a second tool, too. A bolt cutter.

569
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:03,979
He used that to clear his view.

570
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,279
But?

571
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,513
I don't think that's what he brought it for.

572
00:45:08,255 --> 00:45:10,519
It's too heavy. Too awkward.

573
00:45:10,924 --> 00:45:12,721
And he had to carry it a long way.

574
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,193
And what do we make of that symbol?

575
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:16,957
Asian Studies at Langley...

576
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,294
identified it as a Chinese character.

577
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:21,967
It appears on a mah-jong piece.

578
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:25,198
- It marks the Red Dragon. - Red Dragon. Correct.

579
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:28,072
This boy begins to interest me.

580
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,876
We don't know what greater meaning the symbol might have...

581
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:34,311
LECTER: Do you like my little exercise cage, Will?

582
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:37,214
My so-called lawyer is always nagging Dr. Chilton...

583
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:38,649
for better accommodations.

584
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:40,744
I don't know which is the greater fool.

585
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,153
Perhaps if you could offer some insight into...

586
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:47,784
"A robin redbreast in a cage Puts all heaven in a rage"

587
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:52,096
Ever been a redbreast, Will? Of course you have.

588
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:54,866
I'm allowed 30 minutes in here, once a week.

589
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:56,732
Get to the point.

590
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,832
He meant to use the bolt cutter to enter the house...

591
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,032
but he didn't.

592
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:03,736
Instead he broke in through the patio doors.

593
00:46:04,278 --> 00:46:07,213
The noise woke Jacobi, and he had to shoot him on the stairs.

594
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:09,249
That wasn't planned. It was sloppy.

595
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:11,181
And that's not like him.

596
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,343
We mustn't judge too harshly, Will.

597
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:16,422
It was his first time.

598
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:19,916
Have you never felt a sudden rush of panic?

599
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,129
Yeah, that's the fear we talked about.

600
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:30,761
It takes experience to master it.

601
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,596
You sensed who I was...

602
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:35,141
back when I was committing what you call my "crimes."

603
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:36,266
Yes.

604
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:38,709
So you were hurt not by a fault in your perception...

605
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:40,178
or your instincts...

606
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:44,476
but because you failed to act on them until it was too late.

607
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,247
- You could say that. - But you're wiser now.

608
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:49,770
Imagine what you would do, 

609
00:46:49,787 --> 00:46:51,980
Will, if you could go back in time.

610
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:55,786
Put two in your head before you could palm that stiletto.

611
00:46:55,862 --> 00:46:57,762
Very good, Will.

612
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,799
You know, I believe we're making progress.

613
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:03,335
And that's what our pilgrim is doing.

614
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,303
He is refining his methods.

615
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:07,067
He is evolving.

616
00:47:10,143 --> 00:47:13,544
The case file mentioned videos of the Leeds family.

617
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,472
- I'd like to see those. - No.

618
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:17,881
- Why not? - It would be obscene.

619
00:47:18,218 --> 00:47:22,618
You don't make it easy, do you? Still, one aims to please.

620
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,951
I'll call you if I think of anything else.

621
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:27,653
Would you perhaps like to leave me your home number?

622
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:35,031
- That's the end of our session. - For now.

623
00:47:35,235 --> 00:47:37,396
It was only his first time.

624
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,368
Already in Atlanta he did much better.

625
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:43,073
Rest assured, my dear Will...

626
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:45,371
this one will give you plenty of exercise.

627
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:52,116
LECTER: My love to Molly and Josh, goodbye.

628
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:56,188
BARNEY: Go to the back of the cell, Dr. Lecter. Face the wall.

629
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:00,852
BARNEY: If you turn around before the lock snaps...

630
00:48:00,994 --> 00:48:02,325
you'll get a dart.

631
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,023
BARNEY: Understood? LECTER: Yes.

632
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:07,089
You got ten minutes to talk to your lawyer.

633
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:16,871
BARNEY: Starting now. LECTER: Thanks so much, Barney.

634
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,717
LAWYER: Hello, Dr. Lecter?

635
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:27,720
I have those documents you requested me...

636
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:38,592
"Robes, Robespierre, Robin.

637
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,759
"Robin, call for... Robin, fainting...

638
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:46,103
"Redbreast in a cage." 406.9.

639
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:54,145
"A robin redbreast in a cage Puts all heaven in a rage"

640
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:55,475
Yes, that's it.

641
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:57,608
William Blake. Auguries of Innocence.

642
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,844
Think you got it?

643
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,284
Yeah, we should have.

644
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:03,083
We have some books of Blake's paintings, too.

645
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,690
- Want to see them? - Yeah. Thanks.

646
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:07,617
TEMP: Psychology Department...

647
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,423
University of Chicago. Dr. Bloom's office.

648
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:12,522
Hi. This is Bob Greer at Blaine and Edwards Publishing.

649
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:15,760
Dr. Bloom asked me to send The Psychiatrist and the Law...

650
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:17,030
to Will Graham.

651
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:19,595
His assistant was supposed to give me...

652
00:49:19,673 --> 00:49:22,665
the address and phone number, but, darn it, she never did.

653
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:25,540
TEMP: I'm just a temp. Linda will be in on Monday.

654
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:28,341
I have to catch FedEx in about five minutes.

655
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:29,938
I hate to bother Dr. Bloom about it...

656
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:31,881
because he told Linda to send it...

657
00:49:31,952 --> 00:49:34,045
and I don't want to get her into trouble.

658
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:36,885
It's right there in the Rolodex, or whatever.

659
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,823
I'll dance at your wedding if you read it to me.

660
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,828
TEMP: I don't know. I'm really not supposed to.

661
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,194
Be a darling and flip that old rascal...

662
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:47,061
I won't take up any more of your time.

663
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:49,329
Graham, Will.

664
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:52,496
TEMP: All right. Just a minute.

665
00:49:54,374 --> 00:49:56,808
"Gibson, Gordon, Graham."

666
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:58,401
It doesn't give a home address.

667
00:49:58,478 --> 00:49:59,911
What does it have, dear?

668
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,208
TEMP: "FBI, 935

669
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,508
Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington, D.C. "

670
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,552
LECTER: Yeah? TEMP: And let's see.

671
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,920
Here it is.

672
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:12,891
"P.O. Box 3680, Marathon, Florida. "

673
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:14,959
LECTER: Marathon. TEMP: Yes.

674
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:18,358
That's fine. You're an angel.

675
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,472


676
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,518


677
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:50,456


678
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,474


679
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:14,554
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.

680
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:17,648
I've come for the package of infrared.

681
00:51:17,757 --> 00:51:20,783
Right. Put your back against the door and come...

682
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:23,961
forward three steps till you feel tile under your feet.

683
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:26,396
And there's a stool just on the left.

684
00:51:28,568 --> 00:51:32,129
Same Mr. D who's head of Tech Services, am I right?

685
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:35,107
I'm Reba McClane.

686
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:38,807
Just a second more and I will get you some light.

687
00:51:41,615 --> 00:51:43,776
REBA: Okay, here we go.

688
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,789
So, what do you need the IR for?

689
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,721
It's for the zoo.

690
00:51:53,827 --> 00:51:56,591
They want to photograph the nocturnal animals.

691
00:51:56,663 --> 00:52:01,100
That's great. I love animals. I got to warn you, though.

692
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,964
This stuff is pretty sensitive. It can be mean to handle.

693
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:11,543
But I guess I don't need to tell you that.

694
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:23,113
Hey, Reba. Oh, Mr. D. Whoa!

695
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:26,291
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

696
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:27,792
No, Ralph.

697
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:29,692
It's starting to spritz outside.

698
00:52:29,763 --> 00:52:31,128
I'll give you a lift home?

699
00:52:31,197 --> 00:52:32,824
You ride a motorcycle.

700
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,129
How's that gonna help me with the rain?

701
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:37,863
I thought maybe we'd stop off someplace...

702
00:52:38,004 --> 00:52:39,995
have ourselves a little sundowner.

703
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,906
- I've already got a ride. - It's cool.

704
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,846
That's cool. No problemo.

705
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:59,755
If there's anything I hate worse than pity, it's fake pity.

706
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:03,260
Especially from a walking hard-on like Ralph Mandy.

707
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:07,528
- Sorry. - I have no pity.

708
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,496
Ride with me!

709
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:47,071
Thanks, but I take the bus all the time.

710
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:52,136
Mandy is a fool. Ride with me...

711
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:56,444
for my pleasure.

712
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,231
You want to come in? I'll fix us a drink.

713
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:22,939
- Maybe another time. - I will come in.

714
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,618
When is the zoo project?

715
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:36,670
- Maybe next week. They'll call.

716
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:37,880
 - I love zoos.

717
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:44,026
In fact one of my earliest memories is seeing a cougar...

718
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:46,531
when I was about five.

719
00:54:46,633 --> 00:54:49,693
I didn't lose my sight till I was seven. Diphtheria.

720
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:52,067
Could you hand me that knife?

721
00:55:08,955 --> 00:55:13,392
I've always tried to hang on to what that cougar looked like.

722
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:18,330
But by now, to tell the truth, what I see in my head...

723
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:20,558
is probably not in the least bit like a cougar.

724
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:22,794
It's more like a donkey or a goat.

725
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,666
You know, sometimes I'm not so sure I really saw him.

726
00:55:25,772 --> 00:55:28,570
Maybe he's just something I dreamed up.

727
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:33,608
You okay?

728
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:37,676
You don't say much, do you?

729
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:39,880
No, I guess not.

730
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:47,351
Let's talk about something and get it out of the way, okay?

731
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,468
I can hear that you've had...

732
00:56:00,507 --> 00:56:02,941
some kind of soft palate repair.

733
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:07,672
But I understand you fine because you speak very well.

734
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:11,809
If you don't want to talk to me, that's cool.

735
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:15,514
But I hope that you will, because...

736
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,915
I know what it's like to have people...

737
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:21,620
always thinking that you're different.

738
00:56:25,231 --> 00:56:26,789
That's good.

739
00:56:29,669 --> 00:56:31,694
May I touch your face?

740
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,864
I want to know if you're smiling or frowning.

741
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,411
I want to know whether I should just shut up or not.

742
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,321
Take my word that I'm smiling.

743
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,020
I have to go.

744
00:56:58,097 --> 00:57:00,463
If I offended you, I didn't mean to.

745
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:01,898
No.

746
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:11,002
F.B.I. Headquarters, Washington, D.C.

747
00:57:11,077 --> 00:57:12,977
WILL: I don't know what they were like.

748
00:57:13,046 --> 00:57:15,708
It'd help if I could see some of their personal effects.

749
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:18,580
Diaries, letters. Do you have those things?

750
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,778
I sure do. I mean, other than...

751
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:24,779
one or two little keepsakes Niles Jacobi got.

752
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:28,088
That would be Mr. Jacobi's surviving son by his first wife?

753
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,727
Yes. As their executor, 

754
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:31,577
I keep all that stuff in the office...

755
00:57:31,598 --> 00:57:35,557
along with some of the smaller valuables, till after probate.

756
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,535
But the Birmingham P.D.'s been all through it.

757
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:41,199
Could you pack those things and ship them up to me?

758
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,406
I hate to ask. I know it's a pain in the ass.

759
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,612
Hell...

760
00:57:52,952 --> 00:57:56,080
probate judge is an old golfing buddy of mine.

761
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:02,154
Son, just tell me you're gonna nail that son of a bitch.

762
00:58:02,328 --> 00:58:02,953
We're doing our best.

763
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,924
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.

764
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,092
A note hidden in Lecter's cell.

765
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,092
 Sounds like a fan letter.

766
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:11,832
Might've been mailed by the Tooth Fairy.

767
00:58:11,904 --> 00:58:13,428
He wants Lecter's approval.

768
00:58:13,506 --> 00:58:15,838
He's curious about you. He's asking questions.

769
00:58:15,908 --> 00:58:17,671
I've scrambled a chopper.

770
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,268
Does Lecter know we have the note?

771
00:58:19,345 --> 00:58:21,540
CRAWFORD: Not yet. It was found in a routine cleanup.

772
00:58:21,614 --> 00:58:23,047
WILL: They don't open his mail?

773
00:58:23,116 --> 00:58:25,016
CRAWFORD: Need a warrant. X- rays only.

774
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,018
WILL: Where's Lecter? CRAWFORD: The holding cage.

775
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,553
WILL: Can he see his cell?

776
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:31,112
CRAWFORD: No. But he's been there almost half an hour.

777
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,851
He'll soon start to wonder what's wrong.

778
00:58:32,925 --> 00:58:34,984
We got to buy time, Jack.

779
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:39,555
CRAWFORD: Dr. Chilton. CHILTON: Yes?

780
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:41,259
Call your building superintendent...

781
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,165
or engineer, whoever's in charge.

782
00:58:43,236 --> 00:58:45,761
Tell him to pull the circuit breakers on Lecter's hall.

783
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:48,864
Have the super walk down the hall past the cell...

784
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:49,964
carrying tools.

785
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:54,446
He'll be in a hurry, pissed off, too busy to answer questions.

786
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:58,111
And don't forget: Don't touch the note, okay?

787
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,252
Graham's on his way.

788
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:04,150
Listen up! We've got a note coming in on the fly...

789
00:59:04,257 --> 00:59:08,284
possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number One Priority.

790
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:11,286
It has to go back to Lecter's cell within the hour...

791
00:59:11,364 --> 00:59:12,956
unmarked.

792
00:59:13,032 --> 00:59:15,522
We'll need Hair and Fiber,

793
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:17,332
 Latent Prints, then Documents.

794
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:21,000
I'll walk it through myself. Let's go, people!

795
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:28,548
DOLARHYDE [Voiceover]: My dear Dr. Lecter: I wanted to tell you... I'm delighted...

796
00:59:28,548 --> 00:59:30,812
that you've taken an interest in me.

797
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:35,183
And when I learned of your vast correspondence, I thought:

798
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,620
"Dare I?" Of course I do.

799
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:43,093
I don't believe you'll tell them who I am.

800
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,893
Besides, what particular body I currently occupy is trivial.

801
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:49,991
The important thing is what I am becoming.

802
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:54,303
I know that you alone can understand this transformation.

803
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:57,676
I have some things I'd love to show you.

804
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:01,302
If circumstances permit, I hope we can correspond.

805
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,406
I have admired you for years and have...

806
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:06,748
a complete collection of your press notices.

807
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,913
Actually, I think of them as unfair reviews.

808
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,487
As unfair as mine.

809
01:00:13,226 --> 01:00:16,855
They do like to sling demeaning nicknames, don't they?

810
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:20,655
"The Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate?

811
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:24,194
It would shame me for you to read that, if I didn't know...

812
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:27,034
you had suffered the same distortions in the press.

813
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:29,734
I'm fed up with this bloody stupid building!

814
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:31,207
Every day something breaking.

815
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:34,110
SUPER: I swear they ought to tear the whole fucking place down.

816
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:37,205
- How much longer do we have? - Ten minutes, max.

817
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:39,080
BOWMAN: Instructions for answering...

818
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:41,119
were probably in the section Lecter tore out.

819
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:43,587
Why not just throw the whole note away?

820
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:45,350
It was full of compliments.

821
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:47,756
He couldn't bear to part with them.

822
01:00:51,364 --> 01:00:53,798
Now we can mash just a little.

823
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:56,896
You're so sly.

824
01:00:58,604 --> 01:01:00,572
BOWMAN: But so am I.

825
01:01:01,374 --> 01:01:04,468
Aniline dyes and colored inks are transparent to infrared.

826
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,705
These could be the tips of "T's" here and here.

827
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,747
On the end, that's a "P," or possibly an "R."

828
01:01:10,817 --> 01:01:13,718
Maybe this is where he's telling Lecter how to answer him.

829
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:16,152
There's only one way to carry on a conversation...

830
01:01:16,222 --> 01:01:17,416
that's one-way blind.

831
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:19,424
Publication. Wait a minute.

832
01:01:19,492 --> 01:01:21,153
We know this guy reads the Tattler.

833
01:01:21,227 --> 01:01:22,819
That's in his note, right?

834
01:01:22,895 --> 01:01:24,988
The Tooth Fairy, they made that up.

835
01:01:25,097 --> 01:01:27,929
BOWMAN: Three "T's" and an "R" in "Tattler."

836
01:01:27,967 --> 01:01:30,094
How do you communicate through a tabloid?

837
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:32,933
- You got what? News stories. - Personals.

838
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:35,872
Maybe he wants Lecter to answer him through the personals?

839
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:38,502
- That could be it. - We need proofs of the pages...

840
01:01:38,578 --> 01:01:40,068
before the next Tattler's published!

841
01:01:40,146 --> 01:01:41,204
CRAWFORD: I'm on it!

842
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,680
DOLARHYDE: Investigator Graham interests me.

843
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,149
Not your standard gumshoe, is he?

844
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:47,241
More alert.

845
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,220
Purposeful looking.

846
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:52,490
You should have taught him not to meddle.

847
01:01:53,092 --> 01:01:54,753
Forgive the stationery.

848
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:57,352
I chose it because it'll dissolve very quickly...

849
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:59,990
if you should have to swallow it.

850
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:04,202
If I hear from you, next time I might send you something wet.

851
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:08,799
Until then, dear Doctor...

852
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:10,775
I remain your most...

853
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,843
avid fan.

854
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:35,297
CRAWFORD: The Tattler got an ad order signed 666...

855
01:02:35,368 --> 01:02:37,336
Baltimore postmark on the envelope.

856
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:39,303
It's set to run this afternoon.

857
01:02:39,372 --> 01:02:42,864
Chicago field office is sending the text through now.

858
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:47,937
- "Dear Pilgrim." - That's it.

859
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,244
Lecter called him a pilgrim when we talked.

860
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:53,649
"You honor me. You're very beautiful." Christ!

861
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:56,347
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.

862
01:02:56,422 --> 01:02:59,414
"Find help in John 6:22, 8:16...

863
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:01,426
"9:1, Luke 1:7."

864
01:03:01,494 --> 01:03:03,155
- Code. - Has to be.

865
01:03:05,665 --> 01:03:09,601
We've got 19 minutes to get in a message if we can break this.

866
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:12,000
The Tattler can't hold its presses any longer.

867
01:03:12,071 --> 01:03:13,038
It's simple.

868
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:15,665
They only needed cover against casual readers.

869
01:03:15,775 --> 01:03:17,675
- I'm thinking it's a book code. - Code?

870
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:19,040
The first numeral...

871
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:20,942
"100 prayers," may be the page number.

872
01:03:21,013 --> 01:03:23,413
The numbers after could be line and letter. But what book?

873
01:03:23,482 --> 01:03:25,949
- Bible? - No, he's got "Galatians 15:2."

874
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:27,476
It has only six chapters.

875
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,953
Same with "Jonah 6:8." It has four chapters.

876
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:31,284
He wasn't using a Bible.

877
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,018
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book to use.

878
01:03:34,093 --> 01:03:37,028
He specified it in his note, in the part Lecter tore out.

879
01:03:37,096 --> 01:03:38,961
BOWMAN: It would appear so.

880
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:42,023
What about sweating Lecter? In a mental hospital...

881
01:03:42,101 --> 01:03:43,659
- I would think drugs... - No.

882
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,534
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago, to find out...

883
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:48,573
where he buried the Princeton student.

884
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:50,666
He gave them a recipe for dip.

885
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,836
If we sweat him, we lose the connection.

886
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,846
If the Tooth Fairy picked the book...

887
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,348
he knew Lecter would have it in his cell.

888
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,908
- Can we get a list of his books? 

889
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:00,448
- From Chilton, maybe.

890
01:04:00,486 --> 01:04:03,478
No! Wait! Rankin and Willingham, when they tossed his cell...

891
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,490
took Polaroids so they could put everything back in place.

892
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,288
Ask them to meet me with pictures of his bookshelves!

893
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:11,625
CRAWFORD: Where? BOWMAN: The Library!

894
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:17,265
I'm leery of letting Lecter's message run...

895
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:19,566
without knowing what it says.

896
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:23,471
I say let this one run. We keep working on the code.

897
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:26,340
At least it'll encourage the Fairy to contact him again.

898
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:29,243
What if it encourages him to do something besides write?

899
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:31,476
I don't like this any better than you.

900
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:34,514
But it's our best shot.

901
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,318
National Tattler Building, Chicago, II

902
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,003


903
01:04:54,574 --> 01:04:57,604
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

904
01:05:11,357 --> 01:05:13,257
BOWMAN: Oh, my God!

905
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:19,296
Hello?

906
01:05:19,365 --> 01:05:21,629
Jack, it's Lloyd Bowman. I solved the code.

907
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,497
You need to know what it says right now.

908
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:24,729
Okay, Lloyd.

909
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:28,069
It says, "Graham home, Marathon, Florida.

910
01:05:28,207 --> 01:05:30,698
"Save yourself. Kill them all."

911
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:34,971
WILL: Yeah? CRAWFORD: Bowman just broke the code.

912
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:37,780
- What does it say? - I'll tell you in a second.

913
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,977
Now, listen to me. Everything is okay.

914
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:42,816
I've taken care of it. Stay on the phone when I tell you.

915
01:05:42,888 --> 01:05:43,980
Tell me now.

916
01:05:44,056 --> 01:05:45,956
Lecter gave the bastard your home address.

917
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,458
CRAWFORD: Wait.

918
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:16,512
Mom?

919
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:30,227
AGENT [Shouting]: Head down, ma'am.

920
01:06:56,428 --> 01:06:57,986
MOLLY: Is he after you now?

921
01:06:58,063 --> 01:07:00,554
WILL: No, Lecter just suggested it to him.

922
01:07:02,735 --> 01:07:05,101
I hate this, Molly.

923
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,565
I'm sorry.

924
01:07:09,175 --> 01:07:11,769
- It's a sick feeling. - I know it is.

925
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:13,444
But you'll be safe here.

926
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:15,412
Crawford's brother owns this place.

927
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:17,506
No one in the world knows you're here.

928
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:20,176
I'd just as soon not talk about Crawford.

929
01:07:20,753 --> 01:07:24,621
AGENT: What are you using as bait? JOSH: Sometimes I use worms.

930
01:07:24,757 --> 01:07:26,520
AGENT: You like those?

931
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,036
Beneath the yellow folder...

932
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:44,871
you'll find your latest rejection slip...

933
01:07:44,944 --> 01:07:46,468
from the archives.

934
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:50,106
LECTER: It was brought to me by mistake with some of my archives mail.

935
01:07:50,182 --> 01:07:52,980
I'm afraid I opened it without looking.

936
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,946
Sorry.

937
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:03,723
I think we'll remove Dr. Lecter's toilet seat.

938
01:08:27,486 --> 01:08:29,420
CRAWFORD: Atlanta P.D. Nailed him.

939
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:31,456
He had a fake Bureau ID...

940
01:08:31,523 --> 01:08:34,515
and was trying to get the Leeds family autopsy photos.

941
01:08:35,427 --> 01:08:39,022
It's a Federal beef, so Atlanta kicked him back to us.

942
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:40,459
Personally...

943
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:43,023
I'd like nothing better than to see the dirt sandwich...

944
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,932
pulling five at Leavenworth.

945
01:08:45,004 --> 01:08:47,973
But maybe there's a better way to handle this.

946
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,632
Yeah? What's that?

947
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,938
I think we ought to give him a story.

948
01:08:52,177 --> 01:08:53,576
WILL: The Tooth Fairy's ugly...

949
01:08:53,646 --> 01:08:56,911
and he's impotent with members of the opposite sex.

950
01:08:57,683 --> 01:09:01,483
Also, he sexually molests his male victims.

951
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,353
While they're alive?

952
01:09:03,422 --> 01:09:06,050
WILL: Sorry, I can't go into those details.

953
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:07,921
But we do also speculate...

954
01:09:07,993 --> 01:09:10,553
that he's the product of an incestuous home.

955
01:09:10,863 --> 01:09:13,559
No wonder the creep's such a loser, right?

956
01:09:15,668 --> 01:09:18,330
That's a tip we got from Dr. Lecter, by the way.

957
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,771
So it's true that Lecter's helping with your investigation?

958
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:24,338
WILL: Yes, it's true.

959
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,504
The Doctor was offended a bottom-feeding lowlife like...

960
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:30,514
the Tooth Fairy would consider himself in the same league.

961
01:09:34,219 --> 01:09:37,279
Okay, tell me about this place you got here.

962
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:39,914
Will, your little Washington hideaway.

963
01:09:40,025 --> 01:09:41,822
This is an apartment I'm borrowing...

964
01:09:41,894 --> 01:09:44,419
till this creep goes down in flames.

965
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:46,564
I keep copies of the evidence 

966
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,864
so I can work on it at night.

967
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,562
Make sure you can read the name on that building.

968
01:09:51,637 --> 01:09:53,127
PHOTOGRAPHER: Yeah.

969
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,101
All right, I got enough.

970
01:09:57,876 --> 01:10:01,107
Just remember, I scratch your back, you scratch mine.

971
01:10:01,213 --> 01:10:04,614
If my story draws the Fairy in an attack on Graham...

972
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:07,777
and you nail the scumbag, I get an exclusive.

973
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,149
Fuck you, Lounds.

974
01:10:10,222 --> 01:10:12,986
When we see the story, we'll consider what to do...

975
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:15,390
about your sealed indictment.

976
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:20,057
All right, it was a pleasure doing business with you, chumps.

977
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,439
WILL: I feel like I need a shower.

978
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,710
You okay with this?

979
01:10:34,446 --> 01:10:37,142
Better he comes after me than Molly and Josh.

980
01:10:37,449 --> 01:10:39,474
So, yeah, I'm okay with it.

981
01:10:39,585 --> 01:10:41,109
I wish we had something better...

982
01:10:41,186 --> 01:10:43,746
but there's only ten days till the next full moon.

983
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,120
We've got to rattle his cage.

984
01:10:46,258 --> 01:10:49,523
CRAWFORD: We'll stake out this apartment, put snipers on the rooftops.

985
01:10:49,628 --> 01:10:52,688
You'll have a moving box tail, 24/7, in your car...

986
01:10:52,798 --> 01:10:54,595
on the street, wherever you go.

987
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:58,102
You'll wear the Kevlar at all times. No exceptions.

988
01:10:59,938 --> 01:11:01,633


989
01:11:01,707 --> 01:11:03,607


990
01:11:04,376 --> 01:11:05,707
You again?

991
01:11:05,778 --> 01:11:08,838
Come back at 4:00 a.m. When I open, all right?

992
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:16,254
Hey, I told you!

993
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:17,948
DOLARHYDE: What?

994
01:11:19,224 --> 01:11:21,124
You told me what?

995
01:11:32,004 --> 01:11:33,665


996
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,243
LOUNDS: Fucking dickhead!

997
01:11:44,716 --> 01:11:47,514
Is that your fucking name on the sign?

998
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:45,572
LOUNDS: Where am I?

999
01:12:48,881 --> 01:12:50,849
What am I doing here?

1000
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:53,274
DOLARHYDE: Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

1001
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,311
LOUNDS: I haven't seen your face.

1002
01:12:57,422 --> 01:12:59,947
I couldn't possibly identify you.

1003
01:13:00,425 --> 01:13:03,553
I work for the National Tattler.

1004
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:08,061
It would pay...

1005
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,334
a big reward for me.

1006
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,207
I mean, a half a million...

1007
01:13:16,341 --> 01:13:18,571
or a million, maybe.

1008
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,306
DOLARHYDE: Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?

1009
01:13:21,413 --> 01:13:23,040
No.

1010
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,412
And I don't want to know.

1011
01:13:25,584 --> 01:13:26,881
You know, believe me.

1012
01:13:26,952 --> 01:13:30,854
DOLARHYDE: According to you, I'm a vicious, perverted sexual failure...

1013
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,518
a "bottom-feeding lowlife"...

1014
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:35,593
who's about to "go down in flames."

1015
01:13:37,596 --> 01:13:39,996
I think you know now, don't you?

1016
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,690
Yes.

1017
01:13:45,437 --> 01:13:48,372
DOLARHYDE: Do you understand what I'm doing, Mr. Lounds?

1018
01:13:49,274 --> 01:13:50,707
No.

1019
01:13:50,776 --> 01:13:52,801
But I would like to.

1020
01:13:52,878 --> 01:13:55,210
I really want to understand...

1021
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:59,044
and then all my readers could understand, too.

1022
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:01,646
DOLARHYDE: I am not a man.

1023
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:03,254
I began as one...

1024
01:14:03,322 --> 01:14:06,223
but each being that I change makes me...

1025
01:14:06,325 --> 01:14:08,259
more than a man...

1026
01:14:08,327 --> 01:14:09,794
as you will witness.

1027
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:12,056
I don't need to see you. No.

1028
01:14:12,297 --> 01:14:14,561
But you must, Mr. Lounds.

1029
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:16,557
You're a reporter.

1030
01:14:16,635 --> 01:14:18,603
You're here to report.

1031
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:29,737
Open your eyes and look at me.

1032
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:31,145
No.

1033
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:32,911
If you won't open them...

1034
01:14:32,985 --> 01:14:35,249
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.

1035
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,878
No!

1036
01:14:37,022 --> 01:14:38,785
DOLARHYDE: Open your eyes!

1037
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:56,072
Oh, my dear God Jesus!

1038
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,845
Oh, God!

1039
01:15:19,464 --> 01:15:21,796
Do you want to know what I am?

1040
01:15:22,701 --> 01:15:24,464
More than anything.

1041
01:15:24,903 --> 01:15:26,734
I was afraid to ask.

1042
01:15:37,716 --> 01:15:39,047
DOLARHYDE: Do you see now?

1043
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:40,345
Yeah, I see.

1044
01:15:40,419 --> 01:15:42,114
Oh, God.

1045
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,584
DOLARHYDE: Mrs. Jacobi in human form.

1046
01:15:44,823 --> 01:15:46,586
DOLARHYDE: Do you see? LOUNDS: Yes.

1047
01:15:46,658 --> 01:15:48,785
DOLARHYDE: Mrs. Leeds in human form.

1048
01:15:48,894 --> 01:15:50,555
- Do you see? - Yes.

1049
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,189
- Mrs. Jacobi changing. - Oh, my God.

1050
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:55,633
Mrs. Leeds changing.

1051
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:57,801
Do you see?

1052
01:15:58,003 --> 01:15:59,971
DOLARHYDE: Mrs. Jacobi reborn.

1053
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:01,933
Do you see?

1054
01:16:02,007 --> 01:16:04,237
Mrs. Leeds reborn.

1055
01:16:04,976 --> 01:16:07,069
- Do you see? - Please, no.

1056
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:09,113
No? No what?

1057
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:11,309
Not me.

1058
01:16:13,852 --> 01:16:16,616
Why did you write lies, Mr. Lounds?

1059
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:21,125
Graham told me to lie.

1060
01:16:22,994 --> 01:16:24,086
LOUNDS: It wasn't me.

1061
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,596
- Will you tell the truth now? - Yes!

1062
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,360
About me?

1063
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,930
- My work? - Oh, yes.

1064
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,228
My becoming?

1065
01:16:33,305 --> 01:16:34,795
Yeah.

1066
01:16:37,275 --> 01:16:40,438
I am the Dragon, and you call me insane!

1067
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,347
You are privy to a great becoming...

1068
01:16:44,449 --> 01:16:46,644
and you recognize nothing.

1069
01:16:46,718 --> 01:16:49,619
You are an ant in the afterbirth.

1070
01:16:50,822 --> 01:16:53,484
It is in your nature to do one thing correctly.

1071
01:16:53,558 --> 01:16:56,220
Before me, you rightly tremble.

1072
01:16:57,129 --> 01:17:00,656
But fear is not what you owe me, Mr. Lounds.

1073
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:10,337
You owe me awe.

1074
01:17:24,189 --> 01:17:25,816
Read.

1075
01:17:29,161 --> 01:17:31,322
DOLARHYDE: That's all, Mr. Lounds.

1076
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,330
You did very well.

1077
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,389
Will you let me go now?

1078
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,033
DOLARHYDE: Soon.

1079
01:17:37,102 --> 01:17:40,902
There's one more way I can help you to better understand.

1080
01:17:41,206 --> 01:17:43,265
I want to understand.

1081
01:17:43,942 --> 01:17:46,672
I do. And I'm really gonna be fair...

1082
01:17:47,212 --> 01:17:48,975
from now on.

1083
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:51,776
You know that.

1084
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:59,948
Hello?

1085
01:18:00,525 --> 01:18:02,550
LOUNDS: Oh, God, no!

1086
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:31,014


1087
01:18:31,089 --> 01:18:33,387
LOUNDS [Recording]: I have had a great privilege.

1088
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,783
I have seen with...

1089
01:18:35,894 --> 01:18:40,593
wonder and awe the strength of the Great Red Dragon.

1090
01:18:41,366 --> 01:18:44,733
He has helped me to understand his splendor...

1091
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,067
and now I want to serve him.

1092
01:18:48,907 --> 01:18:51,637
He knows you made me lie, Will Graham.

1093
01:18:52,544 --> 01:18:54,535
Because I was forced to lie...

1094
01:18:54,613 --> 01:18:57,639
he will be more merciful to me than to you.

1095
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,677
Hello?

1096
01:19:03,088 --> 01:19:05,113
Oh, God, no!

1097
01:19:27,812 --> 01:19:30,508
We can let this tie us up in knots...

1098
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,912
or we can learn from it.

1099
01:19:33,919 --> 01:19:36,649
Maybe even use it to catch the bastard.

1100
01:19:42,427 --> 01:19:44,952
He had to have a van or panel truck...

1101
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,760
to move Lounds around in that big old wheelchair.

1102
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:49,133
Go on.

1103
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,065
He had to already have the wheelchair...

1104
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:52,933
or know where to get one fast.

1105
01:19:53,004 --> 01:19:55,472
It's an antique, not something you'd find in the house.

1106
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:59,203
Does it strike anybody that he set this up in a hurry?

1107
01:19:59,311 --> 01:20:01,711
The Tattler comes off the press Monday night.

1108
01:20:01,813 --> 01:20:05,305
By Tuesday morning he's in Chicago, snatching Lounds.

1109
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,374
He either lives in the Chicago area...

1110
01:20:07,452 --> 01:20:09,886
or he's within a driving radius of...

1111
01:20:09,988 --> 01:20:11,819
call it six hours.

1112
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,552
Find out in this area where the Tattler was available...

1113
01:20:14,659 --> 01:20:16,650
for early distribution Monday night.

1114
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,593
Start with airports, all-night newsstands.

1115
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:20,756
Maybe a newsie remembers an odd customer.

1116
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:22,925
Lloyd, this cassette, enhance the audio.

1117
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:25,731
Maybe you can pick up something in the background.

1118
01:20:25,837 --> 01:20:27,099
That wheelchair...

1119
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:29,265
I want the maker, date, possible sources.

1120
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:33,072
Graham and I will coordinate from Chicago. Let's hustle.

1121
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,887
Look, there's not gonna be any answers in Chicago, Jack.

1122
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:52,587
Okay? I mean, Lounds, that was a bonus.

1123
01:20:53,331 --> 01:20:57,700
That was a chance to show off. It doesn't even fit his pattern.

1124
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:01,662
The Leeds and the Jacobis are what he needs.

1125
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,671
I think I should go back to Baltimore.

1126
01:21:10,749 --> 01:21:12,307
After what he tried to pull?

1127
01:21:12,384 --> 01:21:15,751
Lecter picked up on something in the missing part of the note.

1128
01:21:15,854 --> 01:21:18,448
Not a name, but something, enough to narrow the search.

1129
01:21:18,523 --> 01:21:20,320
Even if he did, he won't tell you.

1130
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:22,417
Not unless I can offer him something.

1131
01:21:23,261 --> 01:21:25,024
LECTER [Voiceover]: Congratulations.

1132
01:21:25,096 --> 01:21:29,863
That was most artistic, the way you disposed of Mr. Lounds.

1133
01:21:30,435 --> 01:21:32,665
Your cell looks bigger with no books in it.

1134
01:21:32,737 --> 01:21:33,704
Does it?

1135
01:21:33,772 --> 01:21:35,399
I hadn't noticed.

1136
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:36,838
WILL: Oh, you will.

1137
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:38,899
I have other resources.

1138
01:21:40,278 --> 01:21:42,769
Tell me, Will. Did you enjoy it?

1139
01:21:43,715 --> 01:21:45,580
Your first murder?

1140
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,050
Of course you did. Why shouldn't it feel good?

1141
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:50,019
It does to God.

1142
01:21:50,622 --> 01:21:53,819
Why, only last week in Texas, he dropped a church roof...

1143
01:21:53,925 --> 01:21:56,223
on the heads of 34 of his worshippers...

1144
01:21:56,294 --> 01:21:58,524
as they were groveling through a hymn.

1145
01:21:58,596 --> 01:22:01,463
He wouldn't begrudge you one journalist.

1146
01:22:01,733 --> 01:22:03,325
Put me next to him, Doctor.

1147
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:05,028
You and some SWAT team?

1148
01:22:05,103 --> 01:22:07,663
Oh, Will. Where's the fun in that?

1149
01:22:07,906 --> 01:22:10,500
He'll have to take his chances, too.

1150
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,973
A roof can fall on anybody.

1151
01:22:14,345 --> 01:22:16,779
But not on Molly and Josh, I take it.

1152
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:18,816
Not yet, anyway.

1153
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:22,119
First he kills the pet, then the family.

1154
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:24,989
Freddy was your pet.

1155
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,917
They're safe now.

1156
01:22:26,991 --> 01:22:29,551
No one will ever be safe around you, Will.

1157
01:22:39,804 --> 01:22:42,364
Clever work on his note, by the way.

1158
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:45,637
And that blackout was an especially nice touch.

1159
01:22:46,811 --> 01:22:49,371
What else was in that note, Doctor?

1160
01:22:53,451 --> 01:22:55,214
Put me next to him!

1161
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,449
That's what you want, isn't it?

1162
01:22:57,522 --> 01:22:59,285
To help him succeed where you failed?

1163
01:22:59,357 --> 01:23:00,915
Twice?

1164
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,290
Give him a chance to kill me.

1165
01:23:04,395 --> 01:23:05,828
Go on, then.

1166
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:08,127
Seduce me with your wares.

1167
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:10,799
Full restoration of your privileges.

1168
01:23:10,869 --> 01:23:13,736
Plus computer access to the AMA archives.

1169
01:23:13,838 --> 01:23:16,500
One hour a week under supervision, of course...

1170
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:17,871
but it's a one-time offer.

1171
01:23:17,942 --> 01:23:20,308
It expires the minute I walk out of here.

1172
01:23:20,378 --> 01:23:22,005
Bit measly, don't you think?

1173
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:26,210
Turn it down, then. See what terms you get from Chilton.

1174
01:23:26,484 --> 01:23:28,008
Are these threats, William?

1175
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:32,079
I'm waiting, Doctor. Or maybe you've got nothing left to sell.

1176
01:23:36,027 --> 01:23:38,894
A little sample, then. Why not?

1177
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,755
- Seen the Blake, have you? - Yes.

1178
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:43,824
No, you've looked but not seen.

1179
01:23:43,902 --> 01:23:45,836
Transformation is the key.

1180
01:23:45,904 --> 01:23:47,769
The man-dragon...

1181
01:23:47,872 --> 01:23:50,432
his ugliness transformed by power.

1182
01:23:50,742 --> 01:23:53,768
Look for a military record with combat training.

1183
01:23:53,878 --> 01:23:55,937
Look for extensive tattooing...

1184
01:23:56,047 --> 01:23:58,311
and corrective surgery, most likely to the face.

1185
01:23:58,383 --> 01:24:01,875
Come on, I'm past that already and you know it.

1186
01:24:02,253 --> 01:24:03,652
Give me what I need.

1187
01:24:03,721 --> 01:24:05,313
How is he choosing the women?

1188
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:08,416
I've already suggested how. The answer was in front of you.

1189
01:24:08,526 --> 01:24:10,203
- You looked but didn't see.

1190
01:24:10,226 --> 01:24:11,823
 - Bullshit! No riddles!

1191
01:24:11,863 --> 01:24:13,057
Just tell me.

1192
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,155
No!

1193
01:24:14,232 --> 01:24:15,221
LECTER: It's your turn.

1194
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,700
I asked you before for a small courtesy...

1195
01:24:17,769 --> 01:24:19,930
and you responded rudely.

1196
01:24:21,206 --> 01:24:22,969
Before I tell you anything more...

1197
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:26,067
you will make certain arrangements for me.

1198
01:24:26,377 --> 01:24:28,368
What kind of arrangements?

1199
01:24:28,446 --> 01:24:30,209
Oh, nothing much.

1200
01:24:30,949 --> 01:24:33,315
Shall we say dinner and a show?

1201
01:24:36,788 --> 01:24:39,985
You ready to tell me what kind of outing this is?

1202
01:24:40,892 --> 01:24:42,450
Nope.

1203
01:24:43,294 --> 01:24:46,388
You're just full of surprises, aren't you, D?

1204
01:24:47,131 --> 01:24:48,621
Yep.

1205
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,098
WARFIELD: He's about six feet away.

1206
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,138
Can you smell him?

1207
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,228
Yeah.

1208
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:58,833
Now, he's a little noisy, but he's sedated, I assure you.

1209
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,237
Doctor Hassler's about to fix his broken tooth.

1210
01:25:02,313 --> 01:25:04,042
Glad you could come, Ms. McClane.

1211
01:25:04,115 --> 01:25:06,743
We appreciate the infrared film, by the way.

1212
01:25:06,818 --> 01:25:08,718
WARFIELD: Two more steps.

1213
01:25:08,987 --> 01:25:12,252
I'll put your left hand on the edge of the table.

1214
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:15,259
Now, he's right in front of you.

1215
01:25:15,326 --> 01:25:16,953
Take your time.

1216
01:25:24,335 --> 01:25:27,699
- D? - I'm here.

1217
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,498
You go ahead.

1218
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,115
Here.

1219
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:21,015
Why don't you try this?

1220
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:09,968
Nine steps from the front door to the clock...

1221
01:27:10,074 --> 01:27:12,042
and three more to this room.

1222
01:27:13,277 --> 01:27:15,211
Sorry. Force of habit.

1223
01:27:21,552 --> 01:27:24,715
That beautiful tiger, this house, this music...

1224
01:27:25,723 --> 01:27:28,658
I don't think anybody knows you at all, D.

1225
01:27:28,793 --> 01:27:30,988
Everybody wonders about you, though.

1226
01:27:31,095 --> 01:27:32,960
Especially the women.

1227
01:27:33,731 --> 01:27:35,528
What do they want to know?

1228
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,227
They find you...

1229
01:27:37,301 --> 01:27:39,895
very mysterious and interesting.

1230
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:46,533
Did they tell you how I look?

1231
01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:50,069
They said that you have a remarkable body.

1232
01:27:51,949 --> 01:27:56,079
That you're very sensitive about your face but you shouldn't be.

1233
01:27:56,954 --> 01:27:58,717
Oh, and...

1234
01:28:00,591 --> 01:28:02,582
they asked me if...

1235
01:28:03,294 --> 01:28:05,990
you are as strong as you look.

1236
01:28:07,432 --> 01:28:09,059
And?

1237
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:12,099
I said I didn't know.

1238
01:28:48,706 --> 01:28:50,867
Where the hell are you, D?

1239
01:28:56,781 --> 01:28:58,476
Here you are.

1240
01:29:02,954 --> 01:29:05,889
Do you want to know what I think about it?

1241
01:29:28,312 --> 01:29:31,372
Now, would you show me where the bathroom is?

1242
01:30:04,682 --> 01:30:06,843
I have to do a little work.

1243
01:30:07,919 --> 01:30:10,786
- Lf I'm keeping you from work... - No.

1244
01:30:10,888 --> 01:30:13,448
...l'll go. - I want you to be here.

1245
01:30:13,591 --> 01:30:16,389
I do. It's just a tape I need to watch.

1246
01:30:17,228 --> 01:30:19,253
It won't take long.

1247
01:30:27,038 --> 01:30:30,201
- Do you need to hear it, too? - No.

1248
01:30:30,308 --> 01:30:32,276
May I keep the music?

1249
01:31:33,938 --> 01:31:35,963
What's it about?

1250
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:39,773
Some people I'm going to meet.

1251
01:31:50,488 --> 01:31:52,115
So then...

1252
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:55,787
it's what? It's a corporate promo? 

1253
01:31:55,811 --> 01:31:58,887
Some kind of homework?

1254
01:32:00,865 --> 01:32:04,062
It's homework. Yeah.

1255
01:32:09,674 --> 01:32:11,471
That's a good idea.

1256
01:32:13,344 --> 01:32:15,835
It's so important to be prepared.

1257
01:32:21,886 --> 01:32:24,855
My God, are you ever!

1258
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:01,950
DOLARHYDE: No. I won't give her to you. No.

1259
01:34:12,963 --> 01:34:16,797
Please, just for a little while.

1260
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:26,432
[Crying] No! You're hurting me!

1261
01:34:48,332 --> 01:34:49,890
No...

1262
01:34:50,734 --> 01:34:52,429
she's nice.

1263
01:34:53,637 --> 01:34:55,400
She's okay.

1264
01:35:25,369 --> 01:35:27,865


1265
01:35:40,451 --> 01:35:43,818
I had a really terrific time last night.

1266
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:47,654
But this morning you seem like a different person.

1267
01:35:47,925 --> 01:35:50,655
- Is something wrong? - I have to go now.

1268
01:35:52,563 --> 01:35:54,861
- I have to go away. - Where?

1269
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,596
On a trip.

1270
01:36:01,272 --> 01:36:04,157
- When will I see you again? 

1271
01:36:04,172 --> 01:36:06,937
- Reba, you have to get out. Now.

1272
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:13,040
METCALF [Voiceover]: Dear Mr. Graham:

1273
01:36:13,117 --> 01:36:16,575
Here are the Jacobis' personal effects, as discussed.

1274
01:36:16,654 --> 01:36:18,747
I hope these things might help you.

1275
01:36:18,822 --> 01:36:21,086
Good hunting. Byron Metcalf.

1276
01:36:40,844 --> 01:36:43,540
CRAWFORD: How many more times are we going to watch this?

1277
01:36:43,647 --> 01:36:46,980
WILL: "See them living," he said, "right in front of you."

1278
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:49,110
It's something about these home movies.

1279
01:36:49,186 --> 01:36:52,053
Lecter keeps saying, "You looked, but didn't see."

1280
01:36:52,122 --> 01:36:54,352
CRAWFORD: Lecter says a lot of things.

1281
01:36:57,127 --> 01:37:00,028
Sad damn thing. But we already knew that.

1282
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:03,462
We can't afford to let Lecter waste our...

1283
01:37:03,534 --> 01:37:05,434
No. Again.

1284
01:37:11,976 --> 01:37:13,435


1285
01:37:13,477 --> 01:37:16,674
MS. HARPER: Your dissertation must be nearly finished, Mr. Crane.

1286
01:37:16,747 --> 01:37:17,771
DOLARHYDE: Nearly.

1287
01:37:17,848 --> 01:37:20,681
It's nice to be able to connect a face with a name...

1288
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:22,742
after all our correspondence.

1289
01:37:22,853 --> 01:37:26,846
But, you know, you don't look like I imagined you looked.

1290
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:30,319
What did you think I looked like?

1291
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:32,555
Different.

1292
01:37:43,574 --> 01:37:45,132
[Mouths] Thank you.

1293
01:37:47,378 --> 01:37:50,176
Right there! There.

1294
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:52,711
WILL: That's what he wanted the bolt cutter for.

1295
01:37:52,783 --> 01:37:56,219
To cut that padlock and go in through the basement.

1296
01:37:56,854 --> 01:37:59,084
WILL: But that's a different door.

1297
01:37:59,923 --> 01:38:03,882
I don't get it. The one I saw was flush steel with deadbolts.

1298
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:08,796
Jacobi had a new door installed. Beginning of January, I think.

1299
01:38:08,899 --> 01:38:10,924
It's in here somewhere.

1300
01:38:11,201 --> 01:38:14,068
CRAWFORD: Think he cased the house with the old door?

1301
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:15,833
He brought the bolt cutter, didn't he?

1302
01:38:15,906 --> 01:38:17,339
He was sure he'd need it.

1303
01:38:17,408 --> 01:38:20,002
Why case it two months in advance and not check it?

1304
01:38:20,077 --> 01:38:22,477
I don't know. He was ready with the bolt cutter...

1305
01:38:22,579 --> 01:38:24,012
like at the Leeds' house.

1306
01:38:24,081 --> 01:38:25,708
There he was ready with a glass cutter.

1307
01:38:25,783 --> 01:38:29,310
He must've seen the glass when he walked in the neighborhood.

1308
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,581
No. You can't see that door from the yard.

1309
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:34,317
There's a porch lattice in the way.

1310
01:38:35,459 --> 01:38:38,257
Jack, he knew the inside of the houses.

1311
01:38:50,441 --> 01:38:52,466
Remarkable, isn't it?

1312
01:38:53,577 --> 01:38:55,477
Two hundred years old.

1313
01:38:57,581 --> 01:38:59,344
Yet so fresh.

1314
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:01,712
So vivid.

1315
01:39:37,521 --> 01:39:40,046
He almost looks alive, doesn't he?

1316
01:40:27,137 --> 01:40:30,231
We've just gotten a report here from the...

1317
01:40:41,718 --> 01:40:44,653
CRAWFORD: Do you still have the Jacobis' check stubs...

1318
01:40:44,755 --> 01:40:46,086
and credit card statements?

1319
01:40:46,723 --> 01:40:49,123
We're looking for any kind of service call or purchase...

1320
01:40:49,226 --> 01:40:50,659
that might've required a stranger...

1321
01:40:50,727 --> 01:40:52,058
to enter the house.

1322
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:55,098
CRAWFORD: A repairman, delivery guy. METCALF: Anybody in the house.

1323
01:40:55,165 --> 01:40:56,894
CRAWFORD: Yeah. METCALF: We checked.

1324
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:58,434
CRAWFORD: I know we checked that...

1325
01:40:58,502 --> 01:41:01,096
but now we got to go back to before January.

1326
01:41:01,171 --> 01:41:03,071
METCALF: Last year's purchase orders. CRAWFORD: Yeah.

1327
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,734
WILL: No collar. CRAWFORD: But please hurry. It's urgent.

1328
01:41:05,809 --> 01:41:07,071
No collar.

1329
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:08,941
CRAWFORD: Metcalf says... WILL: No collar.

1330
01:41:09,012 --> 01:41:11,981
The dog had no collar in a neighborhood of dogs...

1331
01:41:12,049 --> 01:41:13,482
but he knew which was theirs.

1332
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:17,749
Same with the Jacobis' cat. No collar, but he knew.

1333
01:41:17,854 --> 01:41:21,017
WILL: He knew about the padlock. He knew about the pane of glass.

1334
01:41:21,124 --> 01:41:23,319
He knew the layout. He knew how to get in.

1335
01:41:23,393 --> 01:41:26,885
Every goddamn thing he needed to know was on this...

1336
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:29,094
Oh, Jesus.

1337
01:41:29,566 --> 01:41:31,090


1338
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:33,728
Is Metcalf still on the phone? Give it!

1339
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:35,968
Byron, it's Graham.

1340
01:41:36,039 --> 01:41:39,805
You said Niles Jacobi took a few keepsakes. Do you have a list?

1341
01:41:39,876 --> 01:41:41,070
METCALF: Yeah, right here.

1342
01:41:41,144 --> 01:41:44,875
I need to know if something he took was a home video.

1343
01:41:44,982 --> 01:41:47,746
A full-length VHS tape, compiled from shorter tapes.

1344
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:50,285
METCALF: I see one videotape. WILL: Yes?

1345
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:56,086
METCALF: But it says, "Meet the Jacobis."

1346
01:41:57,995 --> 01:41:59,622
It's Chromalux.

1347
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:03,761
CRAWFORD: We just got a fax.

1348
01:42:03,834 --> 01:42:06,359
An incident at the Brooklyn Museum.

1349
01:42:06,436 --> 01:42:09,428
A guy attacked two employees, and get this...

1350
01:42:10,173 --> 01:42:12,141
ate the Blake painting.

1351
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:13,904
WILL: What?

1352
01:42:14,578 --> 01:42:16,842
That's him. It's got to be.

1353
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:20,183
If that painting meant so much to him, why destroy it?

1354
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:22,912
And why didn't he kill those two women at the museum?

1355
01:42:22,986 --> 01:42:25,216
They both got a good look at him.

1356
01:42:27,924 --> 01:42:29,824
Maybe he's trying to stop.

1357
01:43:46,036 --> 01:43:48,334
Mr. Crawford, all you've got is a hunch.

1358
01:43:48,405 --> 01:43:51,374
I've got 382 employees, and they've got a union.

1359
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:53,636
I can't just turn you loose on their files.

1360
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:55,200
Not without a court order.

1361
01:43:55,278 --> 01:43:57,872
There are privacy issues. The company's exposure.

1362
01:43:57,948 --> 01:44:00,439
One of the employees has already killed 11 people...

1363
01:44:00,517 --> 01:44:01,745
that we know of.

1364
01:44:01,818 --> 01:44:03,149
If he gets away tonight...

1365
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:04,812
what's the company's exposure on that?

1366
01:44:04,888 --> 01:44:08,187
- I'll get our lawyers here... - We don't have time for that.

1367
01:44:08,258 --> 01:44:09,282
WILL: Listen!

1368
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:11,953
We're looking for a white male, 25 to 35...

1369
01:44:12,028 --> 01:44:13,791
- right-handed with brown hair. - No...

1370
01:44:13,864 --> 01:44:17,561
Listen! Please. He's strong. He's possibly a bodybuilder.

1371
01:44:17,634 --> 01:44:20,535
He might have some kind of facial disfigurement.

1372
01:44:20,604 --> 01:44:23,095
He drives a van or a panel truck.

1373
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:25,173
That sounds like Mr. D.

1374
01:44:25,242 --> 01:44:26,402
Oh, my God.

1375
01:44:26,476 --> 01:44:27,909
Who's Mr. D?

1376
01:44:27,978 --> 01:44:30,503
Francis Dolarhyde, Manager of Technical Services.

1377
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:31,911
What does he do exactly?

1378
01:44:31,982 --> 01:44:34,280
He maintains the equipment for tape transfers.

1379
01:44:34,384 --> 01:44:36,579
Would he have access to people's home videotapes?

1380
01:44:36,653 --> 01:44:39,315
He has access to every tape that comes through here.

1381
01:44:41,324 --> 01:44:43,918
Thanks for dinner, and thanks for letting me vent.

1382
01:44:43,994 --> 01:44:45,757
Look, no problemo.

1383
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:51,664
Reba, listen, I know it's not my place to say this...

1384
01:44:53,437 --> 01:44:54,426
Go on.

1385
01:44:54,504 --> 01:44:58,270
Well, if Dolarhyde is really as moody as you say he is...

1386
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:00,771
maybe you ought to keep some distance.

1387
01:45:00,844 --> 01:45:03,506
I mean, what do you really know about the guy?

1388
01:45:03,947 --> 01:45:06,313
I appreciate your concern, Ralph. Really.

1389
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:09,682
And I promise I'll give it some thought.

1390
01:45:12,122 --> 01:45:14,716
- Hey, have a great vacation. - Thanks.

1391
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:17,716
- See you in a week. - Good night.

1392
01:45:31,141 --> 01:45:33,109
RALPH: I had a great time. REBA: Good night.

1393
01:45:33,176 --> 01:45:34,803
RALPH: Good night!

1394
01:46:05,208 --> 01:46:07,768
Ralph, just 'cause I'm feeling vulnerable...

1395
01:46:28,131 --> 01:46:29,689
DOLARHYDE: Wake up.

1396
01:46:30,901 --> 01:46:35,634
You wandered around in the house while I was asleep, didn't you?

1397
01:46:35,739 --> 01:46:36,728
REBA: What?

1398
01:46:36,806 --> 01:46:39,798
The other night, did you find something odd?

1399
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:45,077
Did you take it and show it to somebody? Did you do that?

1400
01:46:45,248 --> 01:46:47,648
D? What is it?

1401
01:46:47,918 --> 01:46:49,886
What's happening?

1402
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:53,082
- Sit still or he'll hear us! - Who will?

1403
01:46:53,156 --> 01:46:54,919
He's upstairs.

1404
01:46:57,961 --> 01:46:59,861
He wants you, Reba.

1405
01:47:01,932 --> 01:47:04,457
I thought he was gone, but now he's back.

1406
01:47:04,534 --> 01:47:06,399
D, you're scaring me.

1407
01:47:09,239 --> 01:47:11,730
I didn't want to give you to him.

1408
01:47:12,142 --> 01:47:15,578
I did a thing for you today so he couldn't have you.

1409
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:18,307
I was wrong.

1410
01:47:19,549 --> 01:47:23,178
You made me weak and then you hurt me.

1411
01:47:45,075 --> 01:47:46,565
No.

1412
01:47:47,444 --> 01:47:49,605
No, you can't have her!

1413
01:47:50,413 --> 01:47:52,711
Please don't let him have me.

1414
01:47:53,516 --> 01:47:55,074
REBA: You won't.

1415
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:57,314
I'm for you.

1416
01:47:57,621 --> 01:48:00,954
You like me. I know you like me. Take me with you.

1417
01:48:03,593 --> 01:48:07,290
Take you with me? Yes. Put out your hand.

1418
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:09,898
Feel this. That's a shotgun.

1419
01:48:10,033 --> 01:48:13,093
A 12-gauge magnum. Do you know what it'll do?

1420
01:48:14,037 --> 01:48:17,632
I wish I could have trusted you. I wanted to trust you.

1421
01:48:18,975 --> 01:48:21,409
You felt so good!

1422
01:48:22,145 --> 01:48:23,772
So did you.

1423
01:48:25,515 --> 01:48:29,781
- Please don't hurt me now. - It's all over for me.

1424
01:48:39,195 --> 01:48:42,756
- Where are you? - I can't leave you to him.

1425
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:46,201
DOLARHYDE: Do you know what he'll do? He'll bite you to death.

1426
01:48:46,269 --> 01:48:50,637
He'll hurt you so bad! I can't let that happen.

1427
01:48:50,674 --> 01:48:54,667
- It's better if you go with me. - Yes, God, get us out of here!

1428
01:48:54,878 --> 01:48:58,780
- I'll shoot you and then myself. - Oh, no.

1429
01:48:58,848 --> 01:49:01,180
- I have to shoot you. - No...

1430
01:49:08,458 --> 01:49:10,153
I can't do it.

1431
01:49:41,624 --> 01:49:43,319
REBA: Three steps to the clock.

1432
01:49:43,393 --> 01:49:45,884
From the clock to the door, nine more.

1433
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:48,625
Oh, God.

1434
01:49:53,436 --> 01:49:56,064
What is that? What the hell is that?

1435
01:49:56,372 --> 01:49:58,067
That's the place.

1436
01:49:58,141 --> 01:49:59,540
Goddamn it!

1437
01:49:59,609 --> 01:50:01,907
All units, that's his house that's burning.

1438
01:50:19,262 --> 01:50:20,695
FBI

1439
01:50:20,764 --> 01:50:23,597
Francis Dolarhyde! Where is he?

1440
01:50:23,967 --> 01:50:26,094
He's in there. He is dead.

1441
01:50:26,336 --> 01:50:27,564
You know that?

1442
01:50:27,637 --> 01:50:30,197
He shot himself in the face. I put my hand in it.

1443
01:50:30,306 --> 01:50:33,434
He set fire to the house. He was on the floor, and l...

1444
01:50:51,227 --> 01:50:52,990
You all right?

1445
01:51:05,408 --> 01:51:07,137
WILL: That's all I need.

1446
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:09,201
I'd like to come back before I leave town.

1447
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:11,974
WILL: See how you're doing. REBA: Sure, why not?

1448
01:51:12,048 --> 01:51:14,642
Who could resist a charmer like me?

1449
01:51:16,753 --> 01:51:20,587
You know, whatever part of him was still human...

1450
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:23,250
was only kept alive because of you.

1451
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:25,561
You probably saved some lives.

1452
01:51:26,896 --> 01:51:29,126
You didn't draw a freak. Okay?

1453
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:32,895
You drew a man with a freak on his back.

1454
01:51:34,137 --> 01:51:36,002
I should have known.

1455
01:51:36,072 --> 01:51:40,873
No, sometimes you don't. Trust me, I've been there.

1456
01:51:43,913 --> 01:51:47,371
Listen to me. There was plenty wrong with Dolarhyde...

1457
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:49,418
but there's nothing wrong with you.

1458
01:51:51,254 --> 01:51:53,154
Except your hair.

1459
01:51:54,557 --> 01:51:56,081
Your hair is a train wreck.

1460
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,093
Can we please do something about that?

1461
01:51:58,161 --> 01:52:00,425
For next time, maybe? Please?

1462
01:52:02,131 --> 01:52:03,655
That would be nice.

1463
01:52:03,733 --> 01:52:06,065
REBA: Thank you. WILL: Just get some rest.

1464
01:52:06,236 --> 01:52:08,101
WILL: You're gonna be fine.

1465
01:52:14,344 --> 01:52:17,040
ANNOUNCER: Dr. Voss, please call Pharmacy 4421.

1466
01:52:19,148 --> 01:52:21,207
We found this in his safe.

1467
01:52:21,284 --> 01:52:23,377
Thought you might want to take the first look.

1468
01:52:23,453 --> 01:52:25,148
CRAWFORD: You've earned it.

1469
01:52:52,382 --> 01:52:53,940


1470
01:52:55,318 --> 01:52:58,082
WILL: When I read his journal, it was sad.

1471
01:52:59,155 --> 01:53:00,986
It was just so sad.

1472
01:53:03,059 --> 01:53:05,823
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.

1473
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:10,594
He wasn't born a monster.

1474
01:53:10,767 --> 01:53:14,396
This guy was made one through years of abuse.

1475
01:53:14,704 --> 01:53:17,332
- Hey. - Hey, Dad, can we make s'mores?

1476
01:53:17,707 --> 01:53:20,141
- S'mores? - Yeah, s'mores.

1477
01:53:20,243 --> 01:53:22,268
- Yeah, you're on. - All right.

1478
01:53:22,378 --> 01:53:24,539
- Go look in the pantry. - Okay.

1479
01:53:33,256 --> 01:53:34,314
Crawford.

1480
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:36,381
PRICE: Those remains you found in the rubble.

1481
01:53:36,459 --> 01:53:39,292
- They're not Dolarhyde's. - What are you talking about?

1482
01:53:39,729 --> 01:53:42,493
- His damn dentures were there. - But not his bones.

1483
01:53:42,565 --> 01:53:43,827
Wrong DNA.

1484
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,265
Then whose are they?

1485
01:53:45,335 --> 01:53:47,269
Saint Louis P.D. Is looking for...

1486
01:53:47,337 --> 01:53:49,305
a Chromalux employee named Ralph Mandy.

1487
01:53:49,372 --> 01:53:53,671
He should be on vacation, so nobody missed him for a week.

1488
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:56,637
- What is taking him so long? - Are you kidding?

1489
01:53:56,713 --> 01:54:00,080
It takes him 20 minutes to get out of bed in the morning.

1490
01:54:00,183 --> 01:54:03,482
Yeah, but now I have a serious marshmallow jones.

1491
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,188
Josh, what are you doing?

1492
01:54:26,442 --> 01:54:29,605
MOLLY [Recording]: We can't come to the phone. You know the deal.

1493
01:54:29,712 --> 01:54:31,475
Wait for the beep.

1494
01:54:33,082 --> 01:54:36,779
CRAWFORD [On machine]: It's Jack. It's Dolarhyde. He's still alive.

1495
01:54:37,286 --> 01:54:39,652
I'm scrambling everything that rolls or flies...

1496
01:54:39,722 --> 01:54:41,690
but they'll take time to arrive.

1497
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:43,785
Will?

1498
01:54:44,327 --> 01:54:46,557
Christ, Will, where are you?

1499
01:55:43,753 --> 01:55:46,654
Drop it. Do it now, gumshoe.

1500
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:53,925
Your son is about to change.

1501
01:55:55,131 --> 01:55:57,031
Then your wife.

1502
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:59,600
You can watch.

1503
01:56:00,103 --> 01:56:02,003
Then I'll take care of you.

1504
01:56:05,141 --> 01:56:06,768
Look at you.

1505
01:56:06,943 --> 01:56:11,004
I've never seen a child as disgusting as you!

1506
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,874
You pissed your pants? How dare you!

1507
01:56:15,818 --> 01:56:19,151
You dirty little beast. You want me to cut it off?

1508
01:56:19,989 --> 01:56:21,854
Want me to do that, you little freak?

1509
01:56:21,924 --> 01:56:23,186
You want me to cut it off?

1510
01:56:23,259 --> 01:56:26,695
Do you? Don't cry at me, you little faggot!

1511
01:56:27,263 --> 01:56:31,723
Apologize! Say, "I'm sorry, Daddy! I'm a dirty little beast.

1512
01:56:32,435 --> 01:56:34,562
"I'm a freak." Say it!

1513
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:35,830
- No. - Say it!

1514
01:56:35,905 --> 01:56:38,430
- Dad! - Say it, or I will cut it off!

1515
01:56:38,574 --> 01:56:41,236
WILL: "I'm a dirty little beast.

1516
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,278
"Freak! Harelip!

1517
01:56:43,346 --> 01:56:45,576
"And no one will ever love me."

1518
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:49,418
[Shouting] Josh, run! Run!

1519
01:56:58,628 --> 01:57:00,255
Get down!

1520
01:57:01,931 --> 01:57:03,694
You okay?

1521
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:22,141
MOLLY [From downstairs]: Josh? JOSH: Mom?

1522
01:57:22,585 --> 01:57:24,212
MOLLY: Will?

1523
01:57:25,254 --> 01:57:27,154
Where are you guys?

1524
01:57:29,058 --> 01:57:31,083
I thought I heard some kind of...

1525
01:57:32,995 --> 01:57:34,622
Will?

1526
01:57:35,064 --> 01:57:36,964
Molly, get down!

1527
01:57:50,746 --> 01:57:52,373
MOLLY: Will!

1528
01:58:04,694 --> 01:58:06,389
WILL: [Gasps] Shoot...

1529
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:08,897
What?

1530
01:58:08,965 --> 01:58:10,933
Shoot him. Shoot him.

1531
01:58:28,451 --> 01:58:30,078
JOSH: Mommy?

1532
01:58:42,965 --> 01:58:45,832
LECTER [Voiceover]: My dear Will: You must be healed by now.

1533
01:58:46,535 --> 01:58:48,628
On the outside, at least.

1534
01:58:48,738 --> 01:58:50,968
I hope you're not too ugly.

1535
01:58:51,073 --> 01:58:53,701
What a collection of scars you have!

1536
01:58:53,843 --> 01:58:56,107
Never forget who gave you the best of them.

1537
01:58:56,178 --> 01:58:57,611
And be grateful.

1538
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:02,479
Our scars have the power to remind us the past was real.

1539
01:59:02,518 --> 01:59:04,986
We live in a primitive time, don't we, Will?

1540
01:59:05,054 --> 01:59:07,181
Neither savage nor wise.

1541
01:59:07,256 --> 01:59:09,087
Half measures are the curse of it.

1542
01:59:09,158 --> 01:59:13,254
A rational society would either kill me or put me to some use.

1543
01:59:15,831 --> 01:59:18,925
Do you dream much, Will? I think of you often.

1544
01:59:20,102 --> 01:59:22,866
Your old friend, Hannibal Lecter.

1545
01:59:41,924 --> 01:59:44,119
CHILTON: Hannibal? There's someone here to see you.

1546
01:59:44,427 --> 01:59:47,760
Wants to ask a few questions. I said you'd probably refuse.

1547
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:52,463
A young woman. Says she's from the FBI.

1548
01:59:52,568 --> 01:59:55,560
Though she's far too pretty, if you ask me.

1549
01:59:56,872 --> 01:59:59,033
I'll tell her you said no.

1550
02:00:04,613 --> 02:00:06,581
What is her name?
