1
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:55,963
Baltimore, Md 1980

2
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:07,168
"Think to yourself
that every day is your last...

3
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,433
"the hour to which
you do not look forward...

4
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,603
"will come
as a welcome surprise.

5
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,246
"As for me...

6
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:14,747
"when you want a good laugh...

7
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,410
"you will find me,
in a fine state...

8
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:19,347
"fat and sleek...

9
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:22,755
"a true hog of Epicurus' herd."

10
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:28,688
And we find you cribbing lines
from Horace, as well.

11
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:31,197
Well done, John.

12
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:32,994
I must say, Hannibal...

13
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,092
speaking for the rest
of the herd...

14
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:38,864
I'm sorry,
for the Symphony Board...

15
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,305
that these little soirees
of yours...

16
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:43,708
are always the highlight of our year.

17
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:46,370
- Just so.
- You're too kind.

18
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:51,516
I do feel guilty enjoying
tonight when a musician is...

19
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,610
still listed as
a missing person.

20
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:55,383
Yes, poor fellow.

21
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:58,450
Shall I confess
something wicked?

22
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:03,622
I can't help feeling
the tiniest bit... relieved.

23
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,826
It sounds awful, I know.

24
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,893
But, let's face it,
so does the man's playing.

25
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:12,334
Hannibal, confess.

26
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,901
What is this divine-looking
amuse-bouche?

27
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:18,368
If I tell you...

28
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,905
I'm afraid
you won't even try it.

29
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:28,914
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

30
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:48,667
Special Agent Graham.
What an unexpected pleasure.

31
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:51,906
I'm sorry to bother you again,
Dr. Lecter. I know it's late.

32
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:55,176
It's no bother.
We're both night owls, I think.

33
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,609
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

34
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,618
Let me take your coat.

35
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,886
What's on your mind?

36
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:05,892
We've been on the wrong track
this whole time. You and I.

37
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,120
Our whole profile's wrong.

38
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:11,092
We've been looking for someone
with a crazy grudge...

39
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,292
and some kind
of anatomical knowledge.

40
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:16,427
Decertified doctors,
med school dropouts...

41
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:17,731
laid-off mortuary workers...

42
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:21,798
From the precision of the cuts,
and his choice of souvenirs.

43
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:23,399
That's where we're off-target.

44
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:25,708
He's not collecting body parts.

45
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:29,874
- Then why keep them?
- He's not. He's eating them.

46
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:34,316
No, listen. We were at
Molly's parents' for New Year's...

47
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:36,322
and her dad was showing
my son, Josh...

48
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:38,324
how to carve a roasted chicken.

49
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:41,327
He said, "The tenderest part
of the chicken is the oysters...

50
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,294
"on either side of the back."

51
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:47,668
I had never heard that
expression before, "oysters."

52
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:51,997
Then suddenly I had a flash
of the third victim...

53
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,403
Darcy Taylor.

54
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:57,274
She was missing flesh from
her back. And then it hit me.

55
00:04:57,378 --> 00:05:00,541
Liver, kidney, tongue, thymus.

56
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:04,278
Every single victim lost
some body part used in cooking.

57
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,712
Have you shared this
with the Bureau?

58
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,417
No, I needed to see you first.
But I'm right. I know I'm right.

59
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:13,926
I'm starting to be able to think
like this one.

60
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:15,758
Yeah, it's fascinating.

61
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:20,497
You know, I'd always suspected
as much. You are an eidetiker.

62
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:22,792
I'm not psychic, Doctor.

63
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:24,838
No, this is different.

64
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,164
More akin
to artistic imagination.

65
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:30,978
You can assume the emotional
point of view of others...

66
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:33,603
even those that might scare
or sicken you.

67
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:36,339
It's a troubling gift,
I should think.

68
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,078
How I'd love
to get you on my couch.

69
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:42,586
Something still doesn't
make sense to me.

70
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,853
You're the best
forensic psychiatrist I know...

71
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:48,585
and somehow,
in all our time together...

72
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:50,654
this possibility
never occurred to you.

73
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:55,258
I am only human, Will.
Perhaps I made a mistake.

74
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:58,996
You don't strike me as a man
who makes very many mistakes.

75
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,630
Now I'm sorry to think
I might...

76
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,972
no longer enjoy
your full confidence.

77
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:06,477
No, I didn't say that.

78
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,712
I don't know what I'm saying.

79
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:13,050
I'm very, very tired.

80
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,352
I almost had it.

81
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:21,056
It'll come to you.

82
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:23,688
Why don't you come back
in the morning?

83
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:26,028
I'll clear some time
on my schedule and...

84
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,727
then we can get started
in revising our profile.

85
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:30,497
Sound good?
Yeah.

86
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:33,131
Rest here,
and I'll get your coat.

87
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,036
Won't be a tick.

88
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:38,300
Don't move.

89
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:42,300
You're in shock now. I don't
want you to feel any pain.

90
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:46,608
In a moment you'll begin to be
light-headed. Then drowsy.

91
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:51,045
Don't resist. It's so gentle.
Like slipping into a warm bath.

92
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,381
I regret it came to this, Will.

93
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:58,755
But every game
must have its ending.

94
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:06,524
Remarkable boy.

95
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,760
I do admire your courage.

96
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:13,202
I think I'll eat your heart.

97
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:18,755
Marathon, FI Several Years Later

98
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:37,269
Hey, Dad. Someone's here.

99
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:43,609
Hey.

100
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:47,816
You've got
a beautiful setup here, Will.

101
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:49,321
Yeah, it's good.

102
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:54,059
- You know why I'm here?
- Yeah, I can guess.

103
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:56,753
How much do you know?

104
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,993
Just what was in
the Miami Herald and the Times.

105
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:03,800
Two families killed
a month apart in their homes.

106
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:07,904
Birmingham and Atlanta.
The circumstances were similar.

107
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:10,809
Not similar. The same.

108
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,739
What have you
kept out of the papers?

109
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:16,612
He smashes mirrors
and uses the pieces.

110
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:20,583
Wears latex gloves, so we've got
no prints. Size 11 shoe.

111
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,156
He's not too comfortable
with locks.

112
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,191
Pried open a patio door
in Birmingham...

113
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,158
used a glass cutter in Atlanta.

114
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:31,358
And his blood's AB positive.

115
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,990
- Somebody hurt him?
- Nope.

116
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:38,460
We typed him from semen
and saliva. He's a secretor.

117
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,341
Tell me something, Will.
You knew what this was.

118
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:50,275
Did you ever consider picking up
the phone and giving me a call?

119
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:51,716
You've got all the people
you need.

120
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:55,687
You've got Dortmund at Harvard.
You got Bloom in Chicago.

121
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:58,053
I've got you down here
fixing boat motors?

122
00:12:58,158 --> 00:13:00,558
Yeah, I like fixing boat motors.

123
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,562
I wouldn't be
very useful to you.

124
00:13:03,664 --> 00:13:05,063
I don't think about it anymore.

125
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,827
Really?
The last two we had, you caught.

126
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:10,563
By doing what you
and the other guys are doing.

127
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:13,139
That's not entirely true.
It's the way you think.

128
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,870
Come on. There's been a lot of
bullshit about the way I think.

129
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:19,172
I've got technicians
to examine evidence...

130
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:20,645
but you've got that other thing.

131
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:24,013
Imagination. Projection.
Whatever.

132
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:27,914
- I know you don't like it.
- You wouldn't like it, either.

133
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:52,439
This freak killed the Jacobis
in Birmingham...

134
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:55,071
on Saturday night, February 25.
Full moon.

135
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:57,116
He killed the Leeds family
in Atlanta...

136
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:58,445
a few nights ago, March 28.

137
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,383
One day short of a lunar month.

138
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,945
If we're lucky, we may have
a little over three weeks...

139
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:04,752
before he does it again.

140
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,557
Will, do you respect
my judgment?

141
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:10,423
Of course.

142
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:14,058
I think we have a better chance
to catch him fast if you help.

143
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,761
Go to Atlanta and look.
Just look.

144
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:20,065
Then help me brief the locals.
That's it.

145
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,299
Crawford has
the whole damn government.

146
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,434
Why does he need you?

147
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:27,446
He just wants me to look
at some evidence, Molly.

148
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:29,812
Give him another point of view.

149
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:33,647
It's a few days, a week maybe,
and I'll be right back.

150
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:35,984
- And you believed that?
- Yes.

151
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:40,219
These kinds of cases
come up very rarely...

152
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:41,659
and I've had experience.

153
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,286
Yes, you have.

154
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:46,930
You're paid up, Will.

155
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:50,096
All of us. Even Josh.

156
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:55,435
There's a chance I could
help them save some lives.

157
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,068
How do I say no to that?

158
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:09,414
This one will never see me
or know my name.

159
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,259
I'll just help them find him.

160
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,158
The cops will take him down,
not me.

161
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,531
I'll be in the back of the pack,
Molly, I promise.

162
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,434
Never in your life.

163
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:32,509
- I know you.
- Come on. Come here.

164
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:38,716
I love you.

165
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,616
See you in a few days.
Okay.

166
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:43,353
I'll call you tonight.

167
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:55,565
'Bye, Dad!

168
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:10,414
Leeds House, Atlanta, Ga

169
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:33,329
Where's the dog?
No one heard barking.

170
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,604
There's nothing about it
in the case file.

171
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:49,035
The intruder enters in the dark
and cuts Charles Leeds' throat.

172
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:52,312
He shoots Valerie Leeds in
the stomach as she's rising...

173
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:54,813
disabling her
but not killing her.

174
00:18:56,516 --> 00:18:58,916
He leaves her
to watch her husband die...

175
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:01,878
then turns
and goes down the hall.

176
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,014
The children were...

177
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,181
The children were still in bed
when they were shot...

178
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:38,349
which might indicate
that he used a silencer.

179
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,131
He dragged the bodies into
the master bedroom, but why?

180
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:54,432
They were already dead
and none of them got the same...

181
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,071
extra attention as Mrs. Leeds.

182
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,433
Small pieces of mirror
were inserted...

183
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,172
in the orbital sockets
of the victims.

184
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,673
This occurred post-mortem.

185
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:47,825
Why did you put mirrors
in their eyes?

186
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,666
The pieces of mirror are to make
their eyes look alive!

187
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:07,400
He wanted an audience.
He wanted them all lined up...

188
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:09,998
watching him
when he touched her.

189
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:13,777
When he touched her.

190
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:20,782
Touched. Talcum powder.

191
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,912
There was talcum powder.

192
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,529
"Mrs. Leeds had traces of
talcum on her right inner thigh.

193
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:30,893
"A complete search
of the home...

194
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:33,762
"led to no such matching talcum
in the house."

195
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:39,302
You took your gloves off,
didn't you? You son of a bitch!

196
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,299
You took your gloves off, touched her...

197
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:44,104
with your bare hand
and wiped her down.

198
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,906
But when the gloves were off,
did you open her eyes?

199
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:56,377
Crawford.

200
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:58,617
Are the Leeds' bodies
still at the morgue?

201
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:01,726
Who's good
with latent prints here?

202
00:23:01,795 --> 00:23:02,784
Atlanta P.D.

203
00:23:02,896 --> 00:23:04,557
They've already printed
the bodies.

204
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,929
Not the bodies.
Tell them to check the eyes.

205
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,627
Mrs. Leeds' eyes.
Even her corneas.

206
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:13,905
I think he took his gloves off.
I think he had to touch her.

207
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:16,141
Jesus, Will.

208
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:19,335
Gentlemen. Ladies.

209
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:21,810
This is what the subject's teeth
look like.

210
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:25,248
The impressions came from
bite marks on Mrs. Leeds.

211
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:28,450
This degree of crookedness...

212
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:31,686
plus the groove
in this central incisor...

213
00:23:31,992 --> 00:23:33,823
makes his bite signature unique.

214
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:35,359
Fuckin' shark.

215
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:37,953
Knock it off!

216
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:41,266
We're grateful to have the FBI.

217
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:43,097
They have a lot of expertise
in this area.

218
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:45,262
In particular,
Investigator Graham does.

219
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:46,669
That right, Jack?

220
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,104
Yes, sir.

221
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:51,033
Anything you want to add,
Mr. Graham?

222
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:54,178
Why don't you come
on up to the front, please?

223
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,981
That's the guy.
Was he?

224
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:00,518
Yeah, that's the guy
who arrested Lecter.

225
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,178
I thought he retired.

226
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:05,189
The son of a bitch
just about gutted him.

227
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:13,899
Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi
were the primary targets.

228
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:17,468
The others were killed
just to complete his fantasy.

229
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,801
I know that might be hard
to accept given what you saw...

230
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:22,899
but this was not random.

231
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,968
This wasn't some killing frenzy.
He was never out of control.

232
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:31,206
These attacks were organized,
the women carefully chosen.

233
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:33,911
We don't know
how he's choosing them, or why.

234
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,716
They lived in different states
and never met.

235
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:38,484
But there is some connection.

236
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:41,988
There's some common factor,
and that's the key.

237
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:45,159
Find out what that is,
and we'll save lives.

238
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:48,564
'Cause this one
is gonna go on and on...

239
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:51,431
until we get smart
or we get lucky.

240
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:54,597
He won't stop.

241
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:58,936
- Why not?
- Because it makes him God.

242
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:02,438
Would you give that up?

243
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:07,850
You asked about the dog.
Last night a vet called us.

244
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:10,716
Leeds and his oldest boy
brought the dog in...

245
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,519
the afternoon
before they were killed.

246
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,057
Had a puncture wound
to its abdomen.

247
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:16,891
The vet had to put it down.

248
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:19,295
Was it wearing a collar
with the address on it?

249
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:20,457
No.

250
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:24,569
- Did the Jacobis have a dog?
- No dog.

251
00:25:24,637 --> 00:25:26,605
They found a litter box
in the basement...

252
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:29,072
cat droppings in it, no cat.

253
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:34,606
If the cat was attacked,
the Jacobis may have buried it.

254
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:38,378
Ask Birmingham
to check that backyard.

255
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:40,749
And tell them to use
a methane probe, it's faster.

256
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:48,154
Yeah. It's for you.

257
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,461
Crawford.

258
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:57,667
Carl, you're the light
of my life.

259
00:25:57,904 --> 00:25:59,428
Would it hold up in court?

260
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:01,435
Okay. Great work.

261
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:06,977
They found a print on
Mrs. Leeds' eye. Partial thumb.

262
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:10,916
Besides that,
there's nothing else to tell you.

263
00:26:10,984 --> 00:26:12,008
Thank you for your time.

264
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:13,779
I can't answer
more questions.

265
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:15,980
Will Graham! Remember me?

266
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,749
Freddy Lounds. I covered
the Lecter case for the Tattler.

267
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,928
- Did the paperback.
- Yeah, I remember.

268
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:25,294
When did they bring you in?
What've you got?

269
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:29,166
You think the Tooth Fairy
will be bigger than Lecter?

270
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,601
I mean, he's already beaten
Lecter's score...

271
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:34,763
You write lying shit,
and the Tattler is an asswipe!

272
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:36,775
You stay away from me.

273
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,805
Get away, Lounds.

274
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:42,504
How about an exclusive?

275
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:46,946
Sorry about that.

276
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:50,216
That guy snuck into the hospital
and took those pictures of me.

277
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:52,484
Remember? With the tubes
hanging out of me?

278
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,890
Forget that prick.

279
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,717
Give yourself some credit.

280
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:57,524
When we catch the Tooth Fairy...

281
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,292
that print plus his teeth
will burn him.

282
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,200
You did that, Will.

283
00:27:02,302 --> 00:27:04,327
That evidence was there, Jack.

284
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:08,797
- It was there for anyone to see.
- But nobody else did.

285
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,241
All I'm sayin' is,
that was very good work.

286
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:14,074
No, good work would be seeing it
all the way through...

287
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,647
and catching the guy.

288
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:19,151
And I can't do that.
I did what you asked me to do.

289
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:21,344
I'm going home.

290
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:25,417
I don't even have any idea
who this guy is.

291
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:28,926
What I just gave them was broad
strokes. He's got no face to me.

292
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:31,929
That's what you said about
Garrett Hobbs, remember?

293
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:34,591
- And you figured him out.
- No, I didn't.

294
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:37,431
- You didn't?
- No, I was stuck on Hobbs.

295
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,872
I had help.

296
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:46,845
From Lecter.

297
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:50,442
Yeah.

298
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:58,585
Jack, don't play games with me.
Don't do it.

299
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:01,523
Just tell me
what's on your mind.

300
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:05,030
I'm saying maybe we've got
a resource we should look into.

301
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:06,588
Is that what this was about?

302
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,724
Did you just want to ask me that
all along?

303
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:11,065
Don't get mad at me.
I'm just doing my job.

304
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:13,537
If you know a better shortcut,
let me know it.

305
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:16,074
If you think there's any chance
he'll talk to me...

306
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:17,769
I'll go myself.

307
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,545
If you can't handle it,
God knows I'd understand that.

308
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:34,716
As a research subject, Lecter
has proven most disappointing.

309
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:38,594
He's simply impenetrable
to psychological testing.

310
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:41,458
Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception.

311
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,769
He folds them into origami.

312
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:46,571
As you see.

313
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:50,072
So you can imagine the stir
your little visit...

314
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:52,168
is causing among my staff,
Mr. Graham.

315
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,944
If you'd care
to share some insights...

316
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:59,246
Dr. Chilton, I'm sorry, I've got
a 4:17 flight back to Atlanta.

317
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,684
Of course.

318
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:06,687
Tell me,
when you saw Lecter's murders...

319
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:08,420
their style, so to speak...

320
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:11,952
were you able, perhaps,
to reconstruct his fantasies?

321
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:15,000
And, if so, did you jot down
any impressions?

322
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,159
No.

323
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,507
Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.

324
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:29,945
The first analysis of Lecter
will be a publisher's wet dream.

325
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:32,644
I'd give you full credit,
of course.

326
00:29:36,456 --> 00:29:39,983
Damn it, man. You must have
some advice. You caught him.

327
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,686
What was your trick?

328
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:44,725
I let him kill me.

329
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:42,013
That's the same atrocious
aftershave you wore in court.

330
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:45,618
I keep getting it for Christmas.

331
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:49,889
Christmas, yes.
Did you get my card?

332
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:52,594
I got it, thank you.

333
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:56,031
So nice of the Bureau's
crime lab to forward that.

334
00:30:57,136 --> 00:31:00,037
They wouldn't give me
your home address.

335
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:03,970
Dr. Bloom sent me your article
on surgical addiction...

336
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:06,545
in the
Journal of Forensic Psychiatry.

337
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:07,636
And?

338
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:11,108
Very interesting,
even to a layman.

339
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:18,281
You say you're a layman.

340
00:31:25,598 --> 00:31:29,466
But it was you who caught me.
Wasn't it, Will?

341
00:31:31,304 --> 00:31:34,831
Do you know how you did it?
I got lucky.

342
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:38,107
I don't think you believe that.

343
00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:41,512
It's in the transcript.
What does it matter now?

344
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:43,946
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

345
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,449
I need your advice, Dr. Lecter.

346
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,085
Birmingham and Atlanta.

347
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:54,988
You want to know how
he's choosing them, don't you?

348
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:58,029
I thought you'd have ideas.
I want you to tell me them.

349
00:31:58,131 --> 00:31:59,462
Why should I?

350
00:31:59,532 --> 00:32:00,931
There are things you don't have.

351
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,662
Research materials.
Maybe even computer access.

352
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:05,327
I'd speak to the Chief of Staff.

353
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:07,367
Yes, Dr. Chilton.

354
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,437
Gruesome, isn't he?

355
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,776
He fumbles at your head like
a freshman pulling at panties.

356
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:17,675
If you recall, Will...

357
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:20,217
our last collaboration
ended rather messily.

358
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:25,651
You'd get to see the file
on this case.

359
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:29,453
- And there's another reason.
- I'm all ears.

360
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:32,529
I thought you might enjoy
the challenge.

361
00:32:32,665 --> 00:32:35,566
Find out if you're smarter
than the person I'm looking for.

362
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,675
Then, by implication, you think
you're smarter than I am...

363
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,907
since it was you who caught me.

364
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,913
I know I'm not smarter than you.

365
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:52,814
Then how did you catch me?

366
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:55,544
You had disadvantages.

367
00:32:55,888 --> 00:32:57,685
What disadvantages?

368
00:32:58,191 --> 00:32:59,715
You're insane.

369
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,158
You're very tanned, Will.

370
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,995
And your hands are so rough.
Not like a cop's hands anymore.

371
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,198
And that shaving lotion is
something a child would select.

372
00:33:14,273 --> 00:33:17,367
Has a little ship on the bottle,
does it not?

373
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:21,013
And how is young Josh
and the lovely Molly?

374
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:24,247
They're always in my thoughts,
you know.

375
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,341
You will not persuade me
with appeals...

376
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:27,886
to my intellectual vanity.

377
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,785
I don't think
I'll persuade you at all.

378
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:31,686
You'll either do it
or you won't.

379
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:34,021
Is that the case file?
Yes.

380
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:35,587
With photos?

381
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:37,856
Let me keep them,
and I might consider it.

382
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,962
No.

383
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:44,259
Do you dream much, Will?

384
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,894
Goodbye, Dr. Lecter.

385
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:49,271
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet!

386
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:51,433
Give me the file, then!

387
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:55,379
And I'll tell you what I think.

388
00:33:57,984 --> 00:34:00,452
I'll need one hour. And privacy.

389
00:34:07,226 --> 00:34:09,558
Just like old times, Will?

390
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:41,790
This is a very shy boy, Will.

391
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:44,091
I'd love to meet him.

392
00:34:44,163 --> 00:34:47,257
Have you considered
that he is disfigured...

393
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,460
or that he may believe
he is disfigured?

394
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:51,093
Yeah, the mirrors.

395
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,138
Notice he smashes
all the mirrors...

396
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:55,332
not just enough
to get the pieces he wants.

397
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,705
And, of course,
those shards in their eyes...

398
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,141
so he can see himself there.

399
00:34:59,278 --> 00:35:00,472
That's interesting.

400
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:02,707
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.

401
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:05,180
I had considered it.

402
00:35:05,318 --> 00:35:07,445
- What about the women?
- Dead?

403
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,010
Mere puppets.

404
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:12,488
You need to see them living,
the way they caught his eye.

405
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:14,019
That's impossible.

406
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:15,855
Almost. Not quite.

407
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:19,656
What were the yards like?

408
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,727
Big backyards, fenced,
some hedges. Why?

409
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:26,661
Because if this pilgrim...

410
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:28,832
feels a special relationship
with the moon...

411
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:31,706
he might like to go outside and look at it.

412
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:33,711
You ever seen blood
in the moonlight?

413
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:35,747
It appears quite black.

414
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:39,473
If one were nude, say,
it'd be better to have...

415
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:41,486
outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.

416
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:45,153
You think the yards are a factor
when he selects victims?

417
00:35:45,224 --> 00:35:46,248
Yes.

418
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:50,093
And there will be more of them,
of course. Victims.

419
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,763
You'll be wanting lots
of these little chinwags...

420
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:55,561
- I take it.
- I might not have time.

421
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:56,896
I do.

422
00:35:57,103 --> 00:35:58,661
I have oodles.

423
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:00,763
I need your opinion now.

424
00:36:00,873 --> 00:36:02,534
Then here's one:

425
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:06,011
You stink of fear
under that cheap lotion.

426
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:09,777
You stink of fear, Will,
but you're not a coward!

427
00:36:11,384 --> 00:36:13,375
You fear me,
but still you came here.

428
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:16,944
You fear this shy boy,
yet still you seek him out.

429
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:22,120
Don't you understand, Will?

430
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:25,587
You caught me
because we're very much alike.

431
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,723
Without our imaginations...

432
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:31,634
we'd be like all those other
poor dullards.

433
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:39,135
Fear is the price
of our instrument.

434
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:40,969
But I can help you bear it.

435
00:36:52,992 --> 00:36:54,584
- You getting his face?
- Yeah.

436
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,127
Okay, you got it?

437
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,120
All right,
let's get the fuck out of here.

438
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:00,493
Sure you're okay?

439
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,157
Yeah, I'm okay.

440
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:05,268
What do you think he
meant by "see them living"?

441
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:07,897
I don't know, maybe nothing.

442
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:10,339
It's hard to separate
his bullshit.

443
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:13,071
But I'm gonna make another pass
at the Leeds' house.

444
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:07,662
All right, Duchess, doll.
That's it.

445
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:09,792
Show me what you can do.

446
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:15,333
Who's that? Get them, Duchess.
Get them, Duch! Go get them!

447
00:38:16,075 --> 00:38:17,838
Go get them, girl!

448
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:19,009
Okay.

449
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:20,409
And action!

450
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:22,413
Charles! What are you doing?

451
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:24,179
Hey, gang.

452
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,547
You crazy man.

453
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,642
How is everybody doing?

454
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,381
Just home from the store.

455
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:31,149
Hi, Daddy.
That's my girl.

456
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:33,555
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, honey. Billy?

457
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:34,683
Hi, Dad.

458
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,250
And sweetie?

459
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:39,525
I am not ready for my close-up,
Mr. DeMille.

460
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,060
What do you think?

461
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:46,162
Get closer. Get closer.
Little closer.

462
00:38:46,872 --> 00:38:49,568
I think we'd better put
these kids to bed early tonight.

463
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,109
They seem tired. Don't you think?

464
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:55,376
Here we are at the pool party.

465
00:38:55,447 --> 00:38:57,244
What are you doing? Stop it!

466
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:59,510
You stop it! I'm telling my mother on you.

467
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:01,348
Now I get my kiss?

468
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,550
- All right, you want a kiss?
- I want one. The romantic kind.

469
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:14,597
Jacobi House, Birmingham, Al

470
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,233
Won't nobody get in through here
again. I'll guaran-damn-tee it.

471
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,779
Why didn't he break in
down there? It's more hidden.

472
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:33,943
Hell, that door's got deadbolts.

473
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:36,112
Reckon he was in
too big a hurry.

474
00:39:37,456 --> 00:39:39,617
No, this one doesn't hurry.

475
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:37,815
You sat right here, didn't you?

476
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:40,781
You watched the children
bury the cat.

477
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:43,151
And then you waited for dark.

478
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:05,508
You're proud.
You had to sign your work.

479
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:45,008
Grandma? Grandma?

480
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:47,450
I'm sorry.

481
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:52,217
I've never seen a child
as dirty and disgusting as you.

482
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:55,226
Look at you! You're soaking wet.
Get out of my bed.

483
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:57,592
No.
Go back to your room.

484
00:41:58,063 --> 00:41:59,587
You're hurting me!

485
00:41:59,698 --> 00:42:01,962
Shut up,
you filthy little beast!

486
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:05,230
I should have put you in
an orphanage, grandson or not.

487
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:09,070
Grandma, don't hurt me.

488
00:42:09,374 --> 00:42:10,534
You're hurting me!

489
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:11,803
Into the bathroom!

490
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,710
Take offyour nightshirt,
and wipe yourself off. Hurry up!

491
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:19,642
Now give me my scissors
from the medicine chest.

492
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:20,719
Please, no!

493
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:23,619
Take that filthy thing
in your hand. Stretch it out.

494
00:42:23,722 --> 00:42:24,916
No, Grandma.

495
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:25,979
Now!
Please!

496
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:29,151
Look down. Do you want
me to cut it off? Do you?

497
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:30,592
No, Grandma!

498
00:42:30,662 --> 00:42:32,493
I pledge you my word, Francis...

499
00:42:32,598 --> 00:42:34,589
ifyou ever make
your bed dirty again...

500
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,566
I'll cut it off.
Do you understand?

501
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:40,935
I'll be a good boy.
I promise.

502
00:44:37,356 --> 00:44:39,119
Good morning, Will.

503
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:41,590
So nice of you to visit again.

504
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:46,630
He carved this on a tree
near the Jacobi house.

505
00:44:47,232 --> 00:44:48,631
With a Buck knife.

506
00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:50,793
The same one later used
on Charles Leeds.

507
00:44:51,103 --> 00:44:52,127
Yes.

508
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,405
Take a walk with me.

509
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:01,946
He had a second tool, too.
A bolt cutter.

510
00:45:02,247 --> 00:45:03,976
He used that to clear his view.

511
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:05,140
But?

512
00:45:05,384 --> 00:45:07,375
I don't think
that's what he brought it for.

513
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:10,551
It's too heavy. Too awkward.

514
00:45:10,956 --> 00:45:12,753
And he had to carry it
a long way.

515
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:15,224
And what do we make
of that symbol?

516
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:16,955
Asian Studies at Langley...

517
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:19,326
identified it
as a Chinese character.

518
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:21,965
It appears on a mah-jong piece.

519
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:25,230
- It marks the Red Dragon.
- Red Dragon. Correct.

520
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:28,103
This boy begins to interest me.

521
00:45:28,507 --> 00:45:31,908
We don't know what greater
meaning the symbol might have...

522
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:34,309
Do you like
my little exercise cage, Will?

523
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:37,314
My so-called lawyer
is always nagging Dr. Chilton...

524
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:38,644
for better accommodations.

525
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,775
I don't know
which is the greater fool.

526
00:45:40,852 --> 00:45:43,150
Perhaps if you could offer
some insight into...

527
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:46,816
"A robin redbreast in a cage
Puts all heaven in a rage"

528
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:51,527
Ever been a redbreast, Will?
Of course you have.

529
00:45:52,497 --> 00:45:54,863
I'm allowed 30 minutes in here,
once a week.

530
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,764
Get to the point.

531
00:45:57,202 --> 00:45:59,864
He meant to use the bolt cutter
to enter the house...

532
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:01,030
but he didn't.

533
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:03,767
Instead he broke in
through the patio doors.

534
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:07,210
The noise woke Jacobi, and he
had to shoot him on the stairs.

535
00:46:07,312 --> 00:46:09,280
That wasn't planned.
It was sloppy.

536
00:46:09,348 --> 00:46:11,213
And that's not like him.

537
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:14,374
We mustn't judge
too harshly, Will.

538
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:15,783
It was his first time.

539
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:19,947
Have you never felt
a sudden rush of panic?

540
00:46:25,397 --> 00:46:28,161
Yeah, that's the fear
we talked about.

541
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:30,793
It takes experience
to master it.

542
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:32,627
You sensed who I was...

543
00:46:32,704 --> 00:46:35,172
back when I was committing
what you call my "crimes."

544
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,298
Yes.

545
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,741
So you were hurt not by a fault
in your perception...

546
00:46:38,844 --> 00:46:39,902
or your instincts...

547
00:46:40,012 --> 00:46:43,914
but because you failed to act
on them until it was too late.

548
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:47,177
- You could say that.
- But you're wiser now.

549
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,512
Imagine what you would do, Will,
if you could go back in time.

550
00:46:52,257 --> 00:46:55,818
Put two in your head before
you could palm that stiletto.

551
00:46:55,894 --> 00:46:57,555
Very good, Will.

552
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:00,830
You know,
I believe we're making progress.

553
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:03,367
And that's what
our pilgrim is doing.

554
00:47:03,435 --> 00:47:05,335
He is refining his methods.

555
00:47:05,404 --> 00:47:06,996
He is evolving.

556
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:13,576
The case file mentioned videos
of the Leeds family.

557
00:47:13,912 --> 00:47:15,504
- I'd like to see those.
- No.

558
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,912
- Why not?
- It would be obscene.

559
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:22,050
You don't make it easy, do you?
Still, one aims to please.

560
00:47:22,788 --> 00:47:24,949
I'll call you
if I think of anything else.

561
00:47:25,057 --> 00:47:27,685
Would you perhaps like
to leave me your home number?

562
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:35,063
- That's the end of our session.
- For now.

563
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:37,428
It was only his first time.

564
00:47:37,636 --> 00:47:40,400
Already in Atlanta
he did much better.

565
00:47:40,772 --> 00:47:43,104
Rest assured, my dear Will...

566
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:45,403
this one will give you
plenty of exercise.

567
00:47:49,748 --> 00:47:52,148
My love to Molly and Josh,
goodbye.

568
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,219
Go to the back of the cell,
Dr. Lecter. Face the wall.

569
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,156
If you turn around
before the lock snaps...

570
00:48:01,259 --> 00:48:02,317
you'll get a dart.

571
00:48:02,427 --> 00:48:04,327
Understood?
Yes.

572
00:48:04,396 --> 00:48:07,388
You got ten minutes
to talk to your lawyer.

573
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:16,903
Starting now.
Thanks so much, Barney.

574
00:48:22,814 --> 00:48:24,577
Hello, Dr. Lecter?

575
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:27,751
I have those documents
you requested me...

576
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:38,624
"Robes, Robespierre, Robin.

577
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:41,791
"Robin, call for...
Robin, fainting...

578
00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:46,134
"Redbreast in a cage." 406.9.

579
00:48:51,276 --> 00:48:54,177
"A robin redbreast in a cage
Puts all heaven in a rage"

580
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:55,371
Yes, that's it.

581
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,641
William Blake.
Auguries of Innocence.

582
00:48:57,716 --> 00:48:58,842
Think you got it?

583
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,315
Yeah, we should have.

584
00:49:00,385 --> 00:49:03,115
We have some books
of Blake's paintings, too.

585
00:49:03,321 --> 00:49:05,721
- Want to see them?
- Yeah. Thanks.

586
00:49:06,124 --> 00:49:07,648
Psychology Department...

587
00:49:07,726 --> 00:49:09,455
University of Chicago.
Dr. Bloom's office.

588
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:12,554
Hi. This is Bob Greer at Blaine
and Edwards Publishing.

589
00:49:12,664 --> 00:49:15,895
Dr. Bloom asked me to send
The Psychiatrist and the Law...

590
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:17,025
to Will Graham.

591
00:49:17,135 --> 00:49:19,626
His assistant was
supposed to give me...

592
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:22,696
the address and phone number,
but, darn it, she never did.

593
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:25,571
I'm just a temp.
Linda will be in on Monday.

594
00:49:25,677 --> 00:49:28,373
I have to catch FedEx
in about five minutes.

595
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,970
I hate to bother Dr. Bloom
about it...

596
00:49:30,048 --> 00:49:31,879
because he told Linda
to send it...

597
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:34,042
and I don't want
to get her into trouble.

598
00:49:34,152 --> 00:49:36,916
It's right there in the Rolodex,
or whatever.

599
00:49:37,022 --> 00:49:39,855
I'll dance at your wedding
if you read it to me.

600
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:42,860
I don't know.
I'm really not supposed to.

601
00:49:42,928 --> 00:49:45,226
Be a darling and flip
that old rascal...

602
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,059
I won't take up
any more of your time.

603
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:49,360
Graham, Will.

604
00:49:50,435 --> 00:49:52,528
All right. Just a minute.

605
00:49:54,406 --> 00:49:56,840
"Gibson, Gordon, Graham."

606
00:49:56,908 --> 00:49:58,398
It doesn't give a home address.

607
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,875
What does it have, dear?

608
00:49:59,945 --> 00:50:04,541
"FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue
Northwest, Washington, D.C."

609
00:50:04,616 --> 00:50:06,516
Yeah?
And let's see.

610
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:08,884
Here it is.

611
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,922
"P.O. Box 3680,
Marathon, Florida."

612
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:14,683
Marathon.
Yes.

613
00:50:15,694 --> 00:50:18,390
That's fine. You're an angel.

614
00:51:12,617 --> 00:51:14,517
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.

615
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,680
I've come for
the package of infrared.

616
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:20,815
Right. Put your back
against the door and come...

617
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:23,993
forward three steps till
you feel tile under your feet.

618
00:51:24,095 --> 00:51:26,427
And there's a stool
just on the left.

619
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,161
Same Mr. D who's head
of Tech Services, am I right?

620
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:34,866
I'm Reba McClane.

621
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,839
Just a second more
and I will get you some light.

622
00:51:41,646 --> 00:51:43,807
Okay, here we go.

623
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:50,820
So, what do you need the IR for?

624
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,685
It's for the zoo.

625
00:51:53,858 --> 00:51:56,622
They want to photograph
the nocturnal animals.

626
00:51:56,695 --> 00:52:01,132
That's great. I love animals.
I got to warn you, though.

627
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:05,995
This stuff is pretty sensitive.
It can be mean to handle.

628
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,575
But I guess
I don't need to tell you that.

629
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:23,145
Hey, Reba. Oh, Mr. D. Whoa!

630
00:52:23,855 --> 00:52:26,323
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

631
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:27,551
No, Ralph.

632
00:52:27,892 --> 00:52:30,019
It's starting to spritz outside.

633
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:31,153
I'll give you a lift home?

634
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:32,856
You ride a motorcycle.

635
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:35,161
How's that gonna help me
with the rain?

636
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:37,895
I thought maybe
we'd stop off someplace...

637
00:52:38,036 --> 00:52:40,027
have ourselves
a little sundowner.

638
00:52:40,105 --> 00:52:42,938
- I've already got a ride.
- It's cool.

639
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:46,877
That's cool. No problemo.

640
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,786
If there's anything I hate worse
than pity, it's fake pity.

641
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:03,292
Especially from a walking
hard-on like Ralph Mandy.

642
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:07,559
- Sorry.
- I have no pity.

643
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,323
Ride with me!

644
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:47,102
Thanks, but I take the bus
all the time.

645
00:53:49,073 --> 00:53:52,167
Mandy is a fool. Ride with me...

646
00:53:54,712 --> 00:53:56,373
for my pleasure.

647
00:54:10,361 --> 00:54:13,262
You want to come in?
I'll fix us a drink.

648
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:22,970
- Maybe another time.
- I will come in.

649
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:33,241
When is the zoo project?

650
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:37,911
- Maybe next week. They'll call.
- I love zoos.

651
00:54:39,724 --> 00:54:44,058
In fact one of my earliest
memories is seeing a cougar...

652
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:46,563
when I was about five.

653
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:49,724
I didn't lose my sight
till I was seven. Diphtheria.

654
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,099
Could you hand me that knife?

655
00:55:08,987 --> 00:55:13,424
I've always tried to hang on
to what that cougar looked like.

656
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:18,361
But by now, to tell the truth,
what I see in my head...

657
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:20,590
is probably not in the least bit
like a cougar.

658
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:22,826
It's more like
a donkey or a goat.

659
00:55:22,934 --> 00:55:25,698
You know, sometimes I'm not
so sure I really saw him.

660
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:28,601
Maybe he's just
something I dreamed up.

661
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:33,207
You okay?

662
00:55:35,547 --> 00:55:37,708
You don't say much, do you?

663
00:55:38,149 --> 00:55:39,810
No, I guess not.

664
00:55:42,787 --> 00:55:47,383
Let's talk about something
and get it out of the way, okay?

665
00:55:57,201 --> 00:55:59,499
I can hear that you've had...

666
00:56:00,538 --> 00:56:02,972
some kind of soft palate repair.

667
00:56:04,075 --> 00:56:07,704
But I understand you fine
because you speak very well.

668
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:11,841
If you don't want to talk to me,
that's cool.

669
00:56:12,917 --> 00:56:15,545
But I hope that you will,
because...

670
00:56:16,888 --> 00:56:18,913
I know what it's like
to have people...

671
00:56:19,023 --> 00:56:21,651
always thinking
that you're different.

672
00:56:25,263 --> 00:56:26,730
That's good.

673
00:56:29,701 --> 00:56:31,601
May I touch your face?

674
00:56:32,904 --> 00:56:35,896
I want to know
if you're smiling or frowning.

675
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:39,443
I want to know whether I should
just shut up or not.

676
00:56:50,021 --> 00:56:52,353
Take my word that I'm smiling.

677
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,017
I have to go.

678
00:56:58,129 --> 00:57:00,256
If I offended you,
I didn't mean to.

679
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:01,532
No.

680
00:57:08,906 --> 00:57:11,033
F.B.I. Headquarters,
Washington, D.C.

681
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:13,009
I don't know
what they were like.

682
00:57:13,077 --> 00:57:15,739
It'd help if I could see
some of their personal effects.

683
00:57:15,813 --> 00:57:18,611
Diaries, letters.
Do you have those things?

684
00:57:18,716 --> 00:57:20,775
I sure do. I mean, other than...

685
00:57:20,885 --> 00:57:23,445
one or two little keepsakes
Niles Jacobi got.

686
00:57:24,922 --> 00:57:28,119
That would be Mr. Jacobi's
surviving son by his first wife?

687
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:31,559
Yes. As their executor, I keep
all that stuff in the office...

688
00:57:31,629 --> 00:57:35,588
along with some of the smaller
valuables, till after probate.

689
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:38,566
But the Birmingham P.D.'s
been all through it.

690
00:57:38,636 --> 00:57:41,230
Could you pack those things
and ship them up to me?

691
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:48,437
I hate to ask.
I know it's a pain in the ass.

692
00:57:50,948 --> 00:57:52,176
Hell...

693
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:56,112
probate judge is
an old golfing buddy of mine.

694
00:57:57,522 --> 00:58:02,186
Son, just tell me you're
gonna nail that son of a bitch.

695
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:02,985
We're doing our best.

696
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:06,956
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.

697
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:10,023
A note hidden in Lecter's cell.
Sounds like a fan letter.

698
00:58:10,134 --> 00:58:11,829
Might've been mailed
by the Tooth Fairy.

699
00:58:11,936 --> 00:58:13,460
He wants Lecter's approval.

700
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:15,836
He's curious about you.
He's asking questions.

701
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,669
I've scrambled a chopper.

702
00:58:17,775 --> 00:58:19,106
Does Lecter know
we have the note?

703
00:58:19,177 --> 00:58:21,543
Not yet. It was found in
a routine cleanup.

704
00:58:21,646 --> 00:58:23,045
They don't open his mail?

705
00:58:23,147 --> 00:58:24,808
Need a warrant.
X-rays only.

706
00:58:24,882 --> 00:58:27,009
Where's Lecter?
The holding cage.

707
00:58:27,118 --> 00:58:28,551
Can he see his cell?

708
00:58:28,653 --> 00:58:31,144
No. But he's been there
almost half an hour.

709
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:32,849
He'll soon start to wonder
what's wrong.

710
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:35,016
We got to buy time, Jack.

711
00:58:38,129 --> 00:58:39,562
Dr. Chilton.
Yes?

712
00:58:39,664 --> 00:58:41,291
Call your building
superintendent...

713
00:58:41,365 --> 00:58:42,855
or engineer,
whoever's in charge.

714
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:45,800
Tell him to pull the circuit
breakers on Lecter's hall.

715
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,896
Have the super walk down
the hall past the cell...

716
00:58:49,006 --> 00:58:49,995
carrying tools.

717
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:54,477
He'll be in a hurry, pissed off,
too busy to answer questions.

718
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:57,742
Don't touch the note, okay?

719
00:58:58,316 --> 00:59:00,147
Graham's on his way.

720
00:59:00,485 --> 00:59:04,182
Listen up! We've got a note
coming in on the fly...

721
00:59:04,288 --> 00:59:08,315
possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
Number One Priority.

722
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:11,318
It has to go back to
Lecter's cell within the hour...

723
00:59:11,395 --> 00:59:12,726
unmarked.

724
00:59:13,064 --> 00:59:17,364
We'll need Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, then Documents.

725
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:21,032
I'll walk it through myself.
Let's go, people!

726
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:27,634
I wanted to tell you...

727
00:59:27,712 --> 00:59:28,701
I'm delighted...

728
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,839
that you've taken an interest in me.

729
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:35,215
And when I learned ofyour vast
correspondence, I thought:

730
00:59:35,853 --> 00:59:38,651
"Dare I?" Of course I do.

731
00:59:40,725 --> 00:59:43,091
I don't believe
you'll tell them who I am.

732
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:46,925
Besides, what particular body
I currently occupy is trivial.

733
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:50,023
The important thing is
what I am becoming.

734
00:59:50,535 --> 00:59:54,335
I know that you alone can
understand this transformation.

735
00:59:54,772 --> 00:59:57,707
I have some things
I'd love to show you.

736
00:59:57,875 --> 01:00:01,333
If circumstances permit,
I hope we can correspond.

737
01:00:02,413 --> 01:00:04,404
I have admired you for years
and have...

738
01:00:04,515 --> 01:00:06,779
a complete collection
ofyour press notices.

739
01:00:06,884 --> 01:00:09,944
Actually, I think of them
as unfair reviews.

740
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:12,518
As unfair as mine.

741
01:00:13,257 --> 01:00:16,886
They do like to sling demeaning
nicknames, don't they?

742
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:20,687
"The Tooth Fairy." What could be
more inappropriate?

743
01:00:21,132 --> 01:00:24,226
It would shame me for you to
read that, if I didn't know...

744
01:00:24,302 --> 01:00:27,066
you had suffered the same
distortions in the press.

745
01:00:27,138 --> 01:00:29,766
I'm fed up with this
bloody stupid building!

746
01:00:29,874 --> 01:00:31,239
Every day something breaking.

747
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:34,142
I swear they ought to tear
the whole fucking place down.

748
01:00:34,245 --> 01:00:37,237
- How much longer do we have?
- Ten minutes, max.

749
01:00:37,315 --> 01:00:39,112
Instructions for answering...

750
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:41,117
were probably in the section
Lecter tore out.

751
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:43,619
Why not just throw
the whole note away?

752
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:45,382
It was full of compliments.

753
01:00:45,456 --> 01:00:47,788
He couldn't bear
to part with them.

754
01:00:51,395 --> 01:00:53,727
Now we can mash just a little.

755
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:56,757
You're so sly.

756
01:00:58,636 --> 01:01:00,126
But so am I.

757
01:01:01,405 --> 01:01:04,499
Aniline dyes and colored inks
are transparent to infrared.

758
01:01:04,609 --> 01:01:07,737
These could be the tips of "T's"
here and here.

759
01:01:07,912 --> 01:01:10,779
On the end, that's a "P," or possibly an "R."

760
01:01:10,848 --> 01:01:13,749
Maybe this is where he's telling
Lecter how to answer him.

761
01:01:13,818 --> 01:01:16,150
There's only one way to carry on
a conversation...

762
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:17,243
that's one-way blind.

763
01:01:17,321 --> 01:01:19,448
Publication. Wait a minute.

764
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:21,150
We know this guy reads the Tattler.

765
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:22,658
That's in his note, right?

766
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,024
The Tooth Fairy,
they made that up.

767
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:27,461
Three "T's" and an "R"
in "Tattler."

768
01:01:27,999 --> 01:01:30,126
How do you communicate
through a tabloid?

769
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:32,965
- You got what? News stories.
- Personals.

770
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:35,870
Maybe he wants Lecter to answer
him through the personals?

771
01:01:35,973 --> 01:01:38,498
- That could be it.
- We need proofs of the pages...

772
01:01:38,609 --> 01:01:40,099
before the next Tattler's published!

773
01:01:40,177 --> 01:01:41,201
I'm on it!

774
01:01:41,312 --> 01:01:43,712
Investigator Graham
interests me.

775
01:01:43,814 --> 01:01:46,180
Not your standard gumshoe,
is he?

776
01:01:46,284 --> 01:01:47,273
More alert.

777
01:01:47,351 --> 01:01:49,148
Purposeful looking.

778
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,521
You should have taught him
not to meddle.

779
01:01:53,124 --> 01:01:54,785
Forgive the stationery.

780
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:57,350
I chose it because
it'll dissolve very quickly...

781
01:01:57,461 --> 01:02:00,021
ifyou should
have to swallow it.

782
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:04,234
If I hear from you, next time
I might send you something wet.

783
01:02:06,737 --> 01:02:08,830
Until then, dear Doctor...

784
01:02:08,906 --> 01:02:10,806
I remain your most...

785
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:12,306
avid fan.

786
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:35,329
The Tattler got an ad order
signed 666...

787
01:02:35,399 --> 01:02:37,367
Baltimore postmark
on the envelope.

788
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:39,335
It's set to run this afternoon.

789
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:42,895
Chicago field office is sending
the text through now.

790
01:02:45,943 --> 01:02:47,877
- "Dear Pilgrim."
- That's it.

791
01:02:48,045 --> 01:02:50,240
Lecter called him a pilgrim
when we talked.

792
01:02:50,348 --> 01:02:53,749
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful." Christ!

793
01:02:54,285 --> 01:02:56,378
"I offer 100 prayers
for your safety.

794
01:02:56,454 --> 01:02:59,423
"Find help in John 6:22, 8:16...

795
01:02:59,523 --> 01:03:01,115
"9:1, Luke 1:7."

796
01:03:01,225 --> 01:03:02,920
- Code.
- Has to be.

797
01:03:05,696 --> 01:03:09,632
We've got 19 minutes to get in
a message if we can break this.

798
01:03:09,734 --> 01:03:12,032
The Tattler can't hold
its presses any longer.

799
01:03:12,103 --> 01:03:13,070
It's simple.

800
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:15,799
They only needed cover
against casual readers.

801
01:03:15,906 --> 01:03:17,703
- I'm thinking it's a book code.
- Code?

802
01:03:17,775 --> 01:03:19,072
The first numeral...

803
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:20,633
"100 prayers,"
may be the page number.

804
01:03:20,745 --> 01:03:23,578
The numbers after could be
line and letter. But what book?

805
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,911
- Bible?
- No, he's got "Galatians 15:2."

806
01:03:25,983 --> 01:03:27,473
It has only six chapters.

807
01:03:27,585 --> 01:03:29,712
Same with "Jonah 6:8."
It has four chapters.

808
01:03:29,787 --> 01:03:31,311
He wasn't using a Bible.

809
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:34,050
Then the Tooth Fairy
named the book to use.

810
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:37,060
He specified it in his note,
in the part Lecter tore out.

811
01:03:37,128 --> 01:03:38,925
It would appear so.

812
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:42,055
What about sweating Lecter?
In a mental hospital...

813
01:03:42,133 --> 01:03:43,657
- I would think drugs...
- No.

814
01:03:43,768 --> 01:03:46,828
They tried sodium amytal on him
three years ago, to find out...

815
01:03:46,937 --> 01:03:48,598
where he buried
the Princeton student.

816
01:03:48,672 --> 01:03:50,663
He gave them a recipe for dip.

817
01:03:50,775 --> 01:03:52,834
If we sweat him,
we lose the connection.

818
01:03:52,943 --> 01:03:54,843
If the Tooth Fairy
picked the book...

819
01:03:54,945 --> 01:03:57,345
he knew Lecter would have it
in his cell.

820
01:03:57,448 --> 01:04:00,440
- Can we get a list of his books?
- From Chilton, maybe.

821
01:04:00,518 --> 01:04:03,510
No! Wait! Rankin and Willingham,
when they tossed his cell...

822
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:06,522
took Polaroids so they could put
everything back in place.

823
01:04:06,624 --> 01:04:09,320
Ask them to meet me with
pictures of his bookshelves!

824
01:04:09,427 --> 01:04:11,156
Where?
The Library!

825
01:04:15,032 --> 01:04:17,296
I'm leery of letting
Lecter's message run...

826
01:04:17,368 --> 01:04:19,598
without knowing what it says.

827
01:04:20,704 --> 01:04:23,502
I say let this one run.
We keep working on the code.

828
01:04:23,607 --> 01:04:26,371
At least it'll encourage
the Fairy to contact him again.

829
01:04:26,477 --> 01:04:29,275
What if it encourages him
to do something besides write?

830
01:04:29,346 --> 01:04:31,371
I don't like this any better than you.

831
01:04:32,316 --> 01:04:34,375
But it's our best shot.

832
01:04:36,654 --> 01:04:38,952
National Tattler Building,
Chicago, II

833
01:04:54,905 --> 01:04:57,635
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

834
01:05:11,388 --> 01:05:12,821
Oh, my God!

835
01:05:18,562 --> 01:05:19,324
Hello?

836
01:05:19,396 --> 01:05:21,660
Jack, it's Lloyd Bowman.
I solved the code.

837
01:05:21,732 --> 01:05:23,529
You need to know what it says
right now.

838
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:24,727
Okay, Lloyd.

839
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:28,100
It says,
"Graham home, Marathon, Florida.

840
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:30,605
"Save yourself. Kill them all."

841
01:05:32,443 --> 01:05:35,003
Yeah?
Bowman just broke the code.

842
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:37,778
- What does it say?
- I'll tell you in a second.

843
01:05:37,882 --> 01:05:40,009
Now, listen to me. Everything is okay.

844
01:05:40,084 --> 01:05:42,917
I've taken care of it. Stay on
the phone when I tell you.

845
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,009
Tell me now.

846
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:45,851
Lecter gave the bastard
your home address.

847
01:05:45,923 --> 01:05:46,890
Wait.

848
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:16,111
Mom?

849
01:06:28,165 --> 01:06:30,258
Head down, ma'am.

850
01:06:56,627 --> 01:06:57,855
Is he after you now?

851
01:06:57,962 --> 01:07:00,590
No, Lecter just suggested it
to him.

852
01:07:02,766 --> 01:07:05,132
I hate this, Molly.

853
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:07,335
I'm sorry.

854
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:11,800
- It's a sick feeling.
- I know it is.

855
01:07:12,009 --> 01:07:13,476
But you'll be safe here.

856
01:07:13,544 --> 01:07:15,341
Crawford's brother
owns this place.

857
01:07:15,512 --> 01:07:17,537
No one in the world
knows you're here.

858
01:07:17,648 --> 01:07:19,775
I'd just as soon
not talk about Crawford.

859
01:07:20,784 --> 01:07:24,652
What are you using as bait?
Sometimes I use worms.

860
01:07:24,788 --> 01:07:26,346
You like those?

861
01:07:41,338 --> 01:07:43,033
Beneath the yellow folder...

862
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,869
you'll find
your latest rejection slip...

863
01:07:44,975 --> 01:07:46,499
from the archives.

864
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:50,138
It was brought to me by mistake
with some of my archives mail.

865
01:07:50,214 --> 01:07:53,012
I'm afraid I opened it
without looking.

866
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:54,578
Sorry.

867
01:08:00,024 --> 01:08:03,755
I think we'll remove
Dr. Lecter's toilet seat.

868
01:08:27,518 --> 01:08:29,349
Atlanta P.D. nailed him.

869
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,454
He had a fake Bureau ID...

870
01:08:31,555 --> 01:08:34,547
and was trying to get
the Leeds family autopsy photos.

871
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:39,054
It's a Federal beef, so Atlanta
kicked him back to us.

872
01:08:39,296 --> 01:08:40,456
Personally...

873
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:43,055
I'd like nothing better
than to see the dirt sandwich...

874
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:44,930
pulling five at Leavenworth.

875
01:08:45,035 --> 01:08:48,004
But maybe there's a better way
to handle this.

876
01:08:48,072 --> 01:08:49,664
Yeah? What's that?

877
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,731
I think we ought
to give him a story.

878
01:08:52,209 --> 01:08:53,574
The Tooth Fairy's ugly...

879
01:08:53,677 --> 01:08:56,942
and he's impotent with members
of the opposite sex.

880
01:08:57,715 --> 01:09:01,515
Also, he sexually molests
his male victims.

881
01:09:01,952 --> 01:09:03,385
While they're alive?

882
01:09:03,454 --> 01:09:06,082
Sorry, I can't go into
those details.

883
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:07,919
But we do also speculate...

884
01:09:08,025 --> 01:09:10,585
that he's the product
of an incestuous home.

885
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:13,454
No wonder the creep's
such a loser, right?

886
01:09:15,699 --> 01:09:18,361
That's a tip we got
from Dr. Lecter, by the way.

887
01:09:18,435 --> 01:09:21,802
So it's true that Lecter's
helping with your investigation?

888
01:09:22,573 --> 01:09:24,370
Yes, it's true.

889
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:27,535
The Doctor was offended
a bottom-feeding lowlife like...

890
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:30,546
the Tooth Fairy would consider
himself in the same league.

891
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:37,311
Okay, tell me about this place you got here.

892
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:39,946
Will, your little
Washington hideaway.

893
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:41,820
This is an apartment I'm borrowing...

894
01:09:41,925 --> 01:09:44,450
till this creep
goes down in flames.

895
01:09:44,561 --> 01:09:48,895
I keep copies of the evidence
so I can work on it at night.

896
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:51,594
Make sure you can read the name
on that building.

897
01:09:51,668 --> 01:09:52,828
Yeah.

898
01:09:54,972 --> 01:09:57,065
All right, I got enough.

899
01:09:57,908 --> 01:10:01,139
Just remember, I scratch
your back, you scratch mine.

900
01:10:01,245 --> 01:10:04,646
If my story draws the Fairy
in an attack on Graham...

901
01:10:04,748 --> 01:10:07,808
and you nail the scumbag,
I get an exclusive.

902
01:10:08,452 --> 01:10:09,646
Fuck you, Lounds.

903
01:10:10,254 --> 01:10:13,018
When we see the story,
we'll consider what to do...

904
01:10:13,123 --> 01:10:15,421
about your sealed indictment.

905
01:10:15,492 --> 01:10:20,088
All right, it was a pleasure
doing business with you, chumps.

906
01:10:29,173 --> 01:10:31,471
I feel like I need a shower.

907
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:33,639
You okay with this?

908
01:10:34,478 --> 01:10:37,174
Better he comes after me
than Molly and Josh.

909
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:39,506
So, yeah, I'm okay with it.

910
01:10:39,616 --> 01:10:41,140
I wish we had
something better...

911
01:10:41,218 --> 01:10:43,778
but there's only ten days
till the next full moon.

912
01:10:43,854 --> 01:10:46,152
We've got to rattle his cage.

913
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:49,555
We'll stake out this apartment,
put snipers on the rooftops.

914
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,720
You'll have a moving box tail,
24/7, in your car...

915
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,627
on the street, wherever you go.

916
01:10:54,698 --> 01:10:58,134
You'll wear the Kevlar
at all times. No exceptions.

917
01:11:04,408 --> 01:11:05,466
You again?

918
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:08,869
Come back at 4:00 a.m.
when I open, all right?

919
01:11:14,818 --> 01:11:16,251
Hey, I told you!

920
01:11:16,353 --> 01:11:17,513
What?

921
01:11:19,256 --> 01:11:20,985
You told me what?

922
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:44,274
Fucking dickhead!

923
01:11:44,748 --> 01:11:47,546
Is that your fucking name
on the sign?

924
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,273
Where am I?

925
01:12:48,912 --> 01:12:50,777
What am I doing here?

926
01:12:51,315 --> 01:12:53,306
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

927
01:12:55,352 --> 01:12:57,343
I haven't seen your face.

928
01:12:57,454 --> 01:12:59,979
I couldn't possibly
identify you.

929
01:13:00,457 --> 01:13:03,585
I work for the National Tattler.

930
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:08,093
It would pay...

931
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,365
a big reward for me.

932
01:13:14,271 --> 01:13:16,171
I mean, a half a million...

933
01:13:16,373 --> 01:13:18,603
or a million, maybe.

934
01:13:18,675 --> 01:13:21,337
Do you know who I am,
Mr. Lounds?

935
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:22,537
No.

936
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:25,444
And I don't want to know.

937
01:13:25,616 --> 01:13:26,878
You know, believe me.

938
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:30,886
According to you,
I'm a vicious, perverted sexual failure...

939
01:13:31,355 --> 01:13:33,550
a "bottom-feeding lowlife"...

940
01:13:33,657 --> 01:13:35,557
who's about to
"go down in flames."

941
01:13:37,628 --> 01:13:40,028
I think you know now, don't you?

942
01:13:42,232 --> 01:13:43,358
Yes.

943
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:48,404
Do you understand
what I'm doing, Mr. Lounds?

944
01:13:49,306 --> 01:13:50,705
No.

945
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:52,832
But I would like to.

946
01:13:52,909 --> 01:13:55,241
I really want to understand...

947
01:13:55,912 --> 01:13:59,075
and then all my readers
could understand, too.

948
01:14:00,017 --> 01:14:01,678
I am not a man.

949
01:14:01,818 --> 01:14:03,251
I began as one...

950
01:14:03,353 --> 01:14:06,254
but each being
that I change makes me...

951
01:14:06,356 --> 01:14:08,256
more than a man...

952
01:14:08,358 --> 01:14:09,825
as you will witness.

953
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:12,088
I don't need to see you. No.

954
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:14,593
But you must, Mr. Lounds.

955
01:14:15,098 --> 01:14:16,565
You're a reporter.

956
01:14:16,667 --> 01:14:18,567
You're here to report.

957
01:14:27,778 --> 01:14:29,769
Open your eyes and look at me.

958
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,938
No.

959
01:14:31,248 --> 01:14:32,909
If you won't open them...

960
01:14:33,016 --> 01:14:35,246
I'll staple your eyelids
to your forehead.

961
01:14:35,352 --> 01:14:36,376
No!

962
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:38,612
Open your eyes!

963
01:14:54,204 --> 01:14:56,104
Oh, my dear God Jesus!

964
01:15:04,114 --> 01:15:05,411
Oh, God!

965
01:15:19,496 --> 01:15:21,828
Do you want to know what I am?

966
01:15:22,733 --> 01:15:24,496
More than anything.

967
01:15:24,935 --> 01:15:26,766
I was afraid to ask.

968
01:15:37,748 --> 01:15:39,079
Do you see now?

969
01:15:39,149 --> 01:15:40,343
Yeah, I see.

970
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,781
Oh, God.

971
01:15:42,352 --> 01:15:44,616
Mrs. Jacobi in human form.

972
01:15:44,855 --> 01:15:46,618
Do you see?
Yes.

973
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,817
Mrs. Leeds in human form.

974
01:15:48,925 --> 01:15:50,586
- Do you see?
- Yes.

975
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:53,128
- Mrs. Jacobi changing.
- Oh, my God.

976
01:15:53,697 --> 01:15:55,528
Mrs. Leeds changing.

977
01:15:55,932 --> 01:15:57,365
Do you see?

978
01:15:58,034 --> 01:15:59,865
Mrs. Jacobi reborn.

979
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,259
Do you see?

980
01:16:02,038 --> 01:16:04,268
Mrs. Leeds reborn.

981
01:16:05,008 --> 01:16:07,101
- Do you see?
- Please, no.

982
01:16:07,177 --> 01:16:09,042
No? No what?

983
01:16:09,646 --> 01:16:10,874
Not me.

984
01:16:13,884 --> 01:16:16,648
Why did you write lies,
Mr. Lounds?

985
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:21,054
Graham told me to lie.

986
01:16:23,026 --> 01:16:24,118
It wasn't me.

987
01:16:24,194 --> 01:16:26,628
- Will you tell the truth now?
- Yes!

988
01:16:26,696 --> 01:16:28,061
About me?

989
01:16:28,732 --> 01:16:30,962
- My work?
- Oh, yes.

990
01:16:31,701 --> 01:16:33,168
My becoming?

991
01:16:33,336 --> 01:16:34,496
Yeah.

992
01:16:37,307 --> 01:16:40,470
I am the Dragon,
and you call me insane!

993
01:16:41,511 --> 01:16:44,378
You are privy
to a great becoming...

994
01:16:44,481 --> 01:16:46,676
and you recognize nothing.

995
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:49,651
You are an ant
in the afterbirth.

996
01:16:50,854 --> 01:16:53,516
It is in your nature
to do one thing correctly.

997
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:56,252
Before me, you rightly tremble.

998
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,687
But fear is not what you owe me,
Mr. Lounds.

999
01:17:08,071 --> 01:17:10,369
You owe me awe.

1000
01:17:24,221 --> 01:17:25,381
Read.

1001
01:17:29,192 --> 01:17:31,353
That's all, Mr. Lounds.

1002
01:17:31,428 --> 01:17:33,191
You did very well.

1003
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:35,421
Will you let me go now?

1004
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:36,792
Soon.

1005
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:40,933
There's one more way I can
help you to better understand.

1006
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:43,297
I want to understand.

1007
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:46,704
I do.
And I'm really gonna be fair...

1008
01:17:47,244 --> 01:17:48,734
from now on.

1009
01:17:50,113 --> 01:17:51,637
You know that.

1010
01:17:58,421 --> 01:17:59,615
Hello?

1011
01:18:00,557 --> 01:18:02,582
Oh, God, no!

1012
01:18:31,121 --> 01:18:33,419
I have had
a great privilege.

1013
01:18:33,823 --> 01:18:35,814
I have seen with...

1014
01:18:35,926 --> 01:18:40,625
wonder and awe the strength
of the Great Red Dragon.

1015
01:18:41,398 --> 01:18:44,765
He has helped me to understand
his splendor...

1016
01:18:44,834 --> 01:18:47,098
and now I want to serve him.

1017
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:51,669
He knows you made me lie,
Will Graham.

1018
01:18:52,575 --> 01:18:54,566
Because I was forced to lie...

1019
01:18:54,644 --> 01:18:57,670
he will be more merciful to me
than to you.

1020
01:19:01,151 --> 01:19:02,345
Hello?

1021
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:05,144
Oh, God, no!

1022
01:19:27,844 --> 01:19:30,540
We can let this
tie us up in knots...

1023
01:19:30,714 --> 01:19:32,807
or we can learn from it.

1024
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,680
Maybe even use it
to catch the bastard.

1025
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:44,984
He had to have a van
or panel truck...

1026
01:19:45,061 --> 01:19:47,791
to move Lounds around
in that big old wheelchair.

1027
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:49,165
Go on.

1028
01:19:49,232 --> 01:19:51,063
He had to already have
the wheelchair...

1029
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:52,691
or know where to get one fast.

1030
01:19:52,802 --> 01:19:55,498
It's an antique, not something
you'd find in the house.

1031
01:19:55,572 --> 01:19:59,235
Does it strike anybody
that he set this up in a hurry?

1032
01:19:59,342 --> 01:20:01,742
The Tattler comes off the press
Monday night.

1033
01:20:01,845 --> 01:20:05,337
By Tuesday morning he's
in Chicago, snatching Lounds.

1034
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:07,383
He either lives
in the Chicago area...

1035
01:20:07,484 --> 01:20:09,918
or he's within
a driving radius of...

1036
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,419
call it six hours.

1037
01:20:11,921 --> 01:20:14,583
Find out in this area where
the Tattler was available...

1038
01:20:14,691 --> 01:20:16,682
for early distribution
Monday night.

1039
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,591
Start with airports,
all-night newsstands.

1040
01:20:18,695 --> 01:20:20,754
Maybe a newsie
remembers an odd customer.

1041
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:22,923
Lloyd, this cassette,
enhance the audio.

1042
01:20:23,033 --> 01:20:25,763
Maybe you can pick up
something in the background.

1043
01:20:25,869 --> 01:20:27,097
That wheelchair...

1044
01:20:27,203 --> 01:20:29,262
I want the maker, date,
possible sources.

1045
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:33,103
Graham and I will coordinate
from Chicago. Let's hustle.

1046
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:48,918
Look, there's not gonna be
any answers in Chicago, Jack.

1047
01:20:49,592 --> 01:20:52,618
Okay? I mean, Lounds, that was a bonus.

1048
01:20:53,363 --> 01:20:57,732
That was a chance to show off.
It doesn't even fit his pattern.

1049
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:01,693
The Leeds and the Jacobis
are what he needs.

1050
01:21:08,711 --> 01:21:10,702
I think I should go back to Baltimore.

1051
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,304
After what he tried to pull?

1052
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:15,782
Lecter picked up on something
in the missing part of the note.

1053
01:21:15,885 --> 01:21:18,445
Not a name, but something,
enough to narrow the search.

1054
01:21:18,555 --> 01:21:20,318
Even if he did, he won't tell you.

1055
01:21:20,423 --> 01:21:22,254
Not unless
I can offer him something.

1056
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:25,056
Congratulations.

1057
01:21:25,128 --> 01:21:29,895
That was most artistic, the way
you disposed of Mr. Lounds.

1058
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:32,662
Your cell looks bigger
with no books in it.

1059
01:21:32,769 --> 01:21:33,736
Does it?

1060
01:21:33,803 --> 01:21:35,430
I hadn't noticed.

1061
01:21:35,505 --> 01:21:36,836
Oh, you will.

1062
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,931
I have other resources.

1063
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:42,744
Tell me, Will. Did you enjoy it?

1064
01:21:43,746 --> 01:21:45,509
Your first murder?

1065
01:21:45,682 --> 01:21:48,082
Of course you did.
Why shouldn't it feel good?

1066
01:21:48,151 --> 01:21:49,743
It does to God.

1067
01:21:50,653 --> 01:21:53,850
Why, only last week in Texas,
he dropped a church roof...

1068
01:21:53,957 --> 01:21:56,255
on the heads of 34 of his worshippers...

1069
01:21:56,326 --> 01:21:58,521
as they were
groveling through a hymn.

1070
01:21:58,628 --> 01:22:01,495
He wouldn't begrudge you
one journalist.

1071
01:22:01,764 --> 01:22:03,322
Put me next to him, Doctor.

1072
01:22:03,433 --> 01:22:05,025
You and some SWAT team?

1073
01:22:05,135 --> 01:22:07,695
Oh, Will.
Where's the fun in that?

1074
01:22:07,937 --> 01:22:10,531
He'll have to take
his chances, too.

1075
01:22:10,707 --> 01:22:12,868
A roof can fall on anybody.

1076
01:22:14,377 --> 01:22:16,811
But not on Molly and Josh,
I take it.

1077
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,541
Not yet, anyway.

1078
01:22:19,215 --> 01:22:22,150
First he kills the pet,
then the family.

1079
01:22:23,052 --> 01:22:24,883
Freddy was your pet.

1080
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:26,948
They're safe now.

1081
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:29,355
No one will ever be safe
around you, Will.

1082
01:22:39,836 --> 01:22:42,396
Clever work on his note,
by the way.

1083
01:22:42,505 --> 01:22:45,668
And that blackout was
an especially nice touch.

1084
01:22:46,843 --> 01:22:49,403
What else was in that note,
Doctor?

1085
01:22:53,483 --> 01:22:55,246
Put me next to him!

1086
01:22:55,752 --> 01:22:57,481
That's what you want, isn't it?

1087
01:22:57,554 --> 01:22:59,317
To help him succeed
where you failed?

1088
01:22:59,389 --> 01:23:00,583
Twice?

1089
01:23:01,024 --> 01:23:03,322
Give him a chance to kill me.

1090
01:23:04,427 --> 01:23:05,860
Go on, then.

1091
01:23:05,929 --> 01:23:08,090
Seduce me with your wares.

1092
01:23:08,431 --> 01:23:10,831
Full restoration
of your privileges.

1093
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,767
Plus computer access
to the AMA archives.

1094
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,532
One hour a week
under supervision, of course...

1095
01:23:16,606 --> 01:23:17,834
but it's a one-time offer.

1096
01:23:17,907 --> 01:23:20,341
It expires
the minute I walk out of here.

1097
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,037
Bit measly, don't you think?

1098
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:26,241
Turn it down, then. See what
terms you get from Chilton.

1099
01:23:26,516 --> 01:23:28,040
Are these threats, William?

1100
01:23:28,117 --> 01:23:32,110
I'm waiting, Doctor. Or maybe
you've got nothing left to sell.

1101
01:23:36,059 --> 01:23:38,926
A little sample, then. Why not?

1102
01:23:39,796 --> 01:23:41,764
- Seen the Blake, have you?
- Yes.

1103
01:23:41,864 --> 01:23:43,855
No, you've looked but not seen.

1104
01:23:43,933 --> 01:23:45,867
Transformation is the key.

1105
01:23:45,935 --> 01:23:47,800
The man-dragon...

1106
01:23:47,904 --> 01:23:50,464
his ugliness
transformed by power.

1107
01:23:50,773 --> 01:23:53,799
Look for a military record
with combat training.

1108
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,969
Look for extensive tattooing...

1109
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:58,309
and corrective surgery,
most likely to the face.

1110
01:23:58,414 --> 01:24:01,906
Come on, I'm past that already
and you know it.

1111
01:24:02,285 --> 01:24:03,650
Give me what I need.

1112
01:24:03,753 --> 01:24:05,311
How is he choosing the women?

1113
01:24:05,421 --> 01:24:08,447
I've already suggested how.
The answer was in front of you.

1114
01:24:08,558 --> 01:24:11,755
- You looked but didn't see.
- Bullshit! No riddles!

1115
01:24:11,894 --> 01:24:13,088
Just tell me.

1116
01:24:13,162 --> 01:24:14,151
No!

1117
01:24:14,264 --> 01:24:15,322
It's your turn.

1118
01:24:15,398 --> 01:24:17,730
I asked you before
for a small courtesy...

1119
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,893
and you responded rudely.

1120
01:24:21,237 --> 01:24:22,966
Before I tell you
anything more...

1121
01:24:23,072 --> 01:24:26,098
you will make
certain arrangements for me.

1122
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:28,400
What kind of arrangements?

1123
01:24:28,478 --> 01:24:30,173
Oh, nothing much.

1124
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,346
Shall we say dinner and a show?

1125
01:24:36,819 --> 01:24:40,016
You ready to tell me
what kind of outing this is?

1126
01:24:40,923 --> 01:24:42,117
Nope.

1127
01:24:43,326 --> 01:24:46,420
You're just full of surprises,
aren't you, D?

1128
01:24:47,163 --> 01:24:48,323
Yep.

1129
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:52,129
He's about six feet away.

1130
01:24:52,201 --> 01:24:53,862
Can you smell him?

1131
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:55,259
Yeah.

1132
01:24:55,338 --> 01:24:58,865
Now, he's a little noisy,
but he's sedated, I assure you.

1133
01:24:59,709 --> 01:25:02,269
Doctor Hassler's about to fix
his broken tooth.

1134
01:25:02,345 --> 01:25:04,040
Glad you could come,
Ms. McClane.

1135
01:25:04,147 --> 01:25:06,775
We appreciate the infrared film,
by the way.

1136
01:25:06,849 --> 01:25:08,441
Two more steps.

1137
01:25:09,018 --> 01:25:12,283
I'll put your left hand
on the edge of the table.

1138
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:15,291
Now, he's right in front of you.

1139
01:25:15,358 --> 01:25:16,985
Take your time.

1140
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:26,858
- D?
- I'm here.

1141
01:25:28,971 --> 01:25:30,461
You go ahead.

1142
01:26:15,451 --> 01:26:16,679
Here.

1143
01:26:19,021 --> 01:26:21,046
Why don't you try this?

1144
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:10,000
Nine steps from the front door
to the clock...

1145
01:27:10,106 --> 01:27:11,903
and three more to this room.

1146
01:27:13,309 --> 01:27:15,243
Sorry. Force of habit.

1147
01:27:21,584 --> 01:27:24,917
That beautiful tiger,
this house, this music...

1148
01:27:25,755 --> 01:27:28,690
I don't think anybody knows you
at all, D.

1149
01:27:28,825 --> 01:27:31,020
Everybody wonders about you,
though.

1150
01:27:31,127 --> 01:27:32,992
Especially the women.

1151
01:27:33,763 --> 01:27:35,526
What do they want to know?

1152
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:37,258
They find you...

1153
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,927
very mysterious and interesting.

1154
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,338
Did they tell you how I look?

1155
01:27:46,642 --> 01:27:50,100
They said that you have
a remarkable body.

1156
01:27:51,981 --> 01:27:56,111
That you're very sensitive about
your face but you shouldn't be.

1157
01:27:56,986 --> 01:27:58,351
Oh, and...

1158
01:28:00,623 --> 01:28:02,614
they asked me if...

1159
01:28:03,326 --> 01:28:06,022
you are as strong as you look.

1160
01:28:07,463 --> 01:28:08,828
And?

1161
01:28:10,266 --> 01:28:12,131
I said I didn't know.

1162
01:28:48,738 --> 01:28:50,899
Where the hell are you, D?

1163
01:28:56,812 --> 01:28:58,336
Here you are.

1164
01:29:02,985 --> 01:29:05,920
Do you want to know
what I think about it?

1165
01:29:28,344 --> 01:29:31,404
Now, would you show me
where the bathroom is?

1166
01:30:04,714 --> 01:30:06,875
I have to do a little work.

1167
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:10,817
- lf I'm keeping you from work...
- No.

1168
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,320
...l'll go.
- I want you to be here.

1169
01:30:13,623 --> 01:30:16,421
I do. It's just a tape
I need to watch.

1170
01:30:17,259 --> 01:30:19,056
It won't take long.

1171
01:30:27,069 --> 01:30:30,232
- Do you need to hear it, too?
- No.

1172
01:30:30,339 --> 01:30:32,239
May I keep the music?

1173
01:31:33,969 --> 01:31:35,630
What's it about?

1174
01:31:37,473 --> 01:31:39,805
Some people I'm going to meet.

1175
01:31:50,519 --> 01:31:51,884
So then...

1176
01:31:53,823 --> 01:31:58,419
it's what? It's a corporate promo?
Some kind of homework?

1177
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:04,093
It's homework. Yeah.

1178
01:32:09,705 --> 01:32:11,502
That's a good idea.

1179
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:15,866
It's so important
to be prepared.

1180
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:24,886
My God, are you ever!

1181
01:33:59,114 --> 01:34:01,981
No. I won't give her to you. No.

1182
01:34:12,995 --> 01:34:16,829
Please, just for a little while.

1183
01:34:24,473 --> 01:34:26,464
No! You're hurting me!

1184
01:34:48,364 --> 01:34:49,524
No...

1185
01:34:50,766 --> 01:34:52,199
she's nice.

1186
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:55,068
She's okay.

1187
01:35:40,482 --> 01:35:43,849
I had a really terrific time
last night.

1188
01:35:44,353 --> 01:35:47,686
But this morning you seem
like a different person.

1189
01:35:47,957 --> 01:35:50,687
- Is something wrong?
- I have to go now.

1190
01:35:52,594 --> 01:35:54,755
- I have to go away.
- Where?

1191
01:35:55,864 --> 01:35:57,263
On a trip.

1192
01:36:01,303 --> 01:36:06,468
- When will I see you again?
- Reba, you have to get out. Now.

1193
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:16,606
Here are the Jacobis'
personal effects, as discussed.

1194
01:36:16,685 --> 01:36:18,778
I hope these things
might help you.

1195
01:36:18,854 --> 01:36:21,118
Good hunting. Byron Metcalf.

1196
01:36:40,876 --> 01:36:43,572
How many more
times are we going to watch this?

1197
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,012
"See them living," he said,
"right in front of you."

1198
01:36:47,082 --> 01:36:49,141
It's something about
these home movies.

1199
01:36:49,218 --> 01:36:52,051
Lecter keeps saying,
"You looked, but didn't see."

1200
01:36:52,154 --> 01:36:54,384
Lecter says a lot of things.

1201
01:36:57,159 --> 01:37:00,060
Sad damn thing.
But we already knew that.

1202
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:03,494
We can't afford
to let Lecter waste our...

1203
01:37:03,565 --> 01:37:04,930
No. Again.

1204
01:37:13,509 --> 01:37:16,706
Your dissertation must be
nearly finished, Mr. Crane.

1205
01:37:16,779 --> 01:37:17,768
Nearly.

1206
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,713
It's nice to be able to connect
a face with a name...

1207
01:37:20,783 --> 01:37:22,774
after all our correspondence.

1208
01:37:22,885 --> 01:37:26,878
But, you know, you don't look
like I imagined you looked.

1209
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:30,249
What did you think
I looked like?

1210
01:37:30,959 --> 01:37:32,187
Different.

1211
01:37:43,605 --> 01:37:44,867
Thank you.

1212
01:37:47,409 --> 01:37:50,207
Right there! There.

1213
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:52,743
That's what he wanted
the bolt cutter for.

1214
01:37:52,815 --> 01:37:56,251
To cut that padlock
and go in through the basement.

1215
01:37:56,885 --> 01:37:59,115
But that's a different door.

1216
01:37:59,955 --> 01:38:03,914
I don't get it. The one I saw
was flush steel with deadbolts.

1217
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,828
Jacobi had a new door installed.
Beginning of January, I think.

1218
01:38:08,931 --> 01:38:10,421
It's in here somewhere.

1219
01:38:11,233 --> 01:38:14,100
Think he cased the house
with the old door?

1220
01:38:14,169 --> 01:38:15,932
He brought the bolt cutter,
didn't he?

1221
01:38:16,004 --> 01:38:17,369
He was sure he'd need it.

1222
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:19,999
Why case it two months
in advance and not check it?

1223
01:38:20,109 --> 01:38:22,509
I don't know. He was ready
with the bolt cutter...

1224
01:38:22,611 --> 01:38:24,010
like at the Leeds' house.

1225
01:38:24,113 --> 01:38:25,740
There he was ready
with a glass cutter.

1226
01:38:25,814 --> 01:38:29,341
He must've seen the glass when
he walked in the neighborhood.

1227
01:38:29,451 --> 01:38:31,612
No. You can't see
that door from the yard.

1228
01:38:31,687 --> 01:38:34,349
There's a porch lattice
in the way.

1229
01:38:35,491 --> 01:38:38,289
Jack, he knew
the inside of the houses.

1230
01:38:50,472 --> 01:38:52,337
Remarkable, isn't it?

1231
01:38:53,609 --> 01:38:55,509
Two hundred years old.

1232
01:38:57,613 --> 01:38:59,103
Yet so fresh.

1233
01:39:00,048 --> 01:39:01,379
So vivid.

1234
01:39:37,553 --> 01:39:40,078
He almost looks alive,
doesn't he?

1235
01:40:27,169 --> 01:40:30,263
We've just gotten
a report here from the...

1236
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:44,685
Do you still have
the Jacobis' check stubs...

1237
01:40:44,786 --> 01:40:46,117
and credit card statements?

1238
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:49,155
We're looking for any kind
of service call or purchase...

1239
01:40:49,258 --> 01:40:50,657
that might've required
a stranger...

1240
01:40:50,759 --> 01:40:52,090
to enter the house.

1241
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:55,129
A repairman, delivery guy.
Anybody in the house.

1242
01:40:55,197 --> 01:40:56,926
Yeah.
We checked.

1243
01:40:56,999 --> 01:40:58,466
I know we checked that...

1244
01:40:58,533 --> 01:41:01,127
but now we got to go back
to before January.

1245
01:41:01,203 --> 01:41:03,103
Last year's purchase orders.
Yeah.

1246
01:41:03,171 --> 01:41:05,765
No collar.
But please hurry. It's urgent.

1247
01:41:05,841 --> 01:41:07,103
No collar.

1248
01:41:07,175 --> 01:41:08,972
Metcalf says...
No collar.

1249
01:41:09,044 --> 01:41:12,013
The dog had no collar
in a neighborhood of dogs...

1250
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,377
but he knew which was theirs.

1251
01:41:13,482 --> 01:41:16,883
Same with the Jacobis' cat.
No collar, but he knew.

1252
01:41:17,886 --> 01:41:21,049
He knew about the padlock.
He knew about the pane of glass.

1253
01:41:21,156 --> 01:41:23,351
He knew the layout.
He knew how to get in.

1254
01:41:23,425 --> 01:41:26,917
Every goddamn thing he needed
to know was on this...

1255
01:41:27,362 --> 01:41:28,727
Oh, Jesus.

1256
01:41:30,999 --> 01:41:33,763
Is Metcalf still on the phone?
Give it!

1257
01:41:34,202 --> 01:41:35,829
Byron, it's Graham.

1258
01:41:36,071 --> 01:41:39,837
You said Niles Jacobi took a few
keepsakes. Do you have a list?

1259
01:41:39,908 --> 01:41:41,068
Yeah, right here.

1260
01:41:41,176 --> 01:41:44,907
I need to know if something
he took was a home video.

1261
01:41:45,013 --> 01:41:47,777
A full-length VHS tape,
compiled from shorter tapes.

1262
01:41:47,883 --> 01:41:50,010
I see one videotape.
Yes?

1263
01:41:53,422 --> 01:41:55,856
But it says, "Meet the Jacobis."

1264
01:41:58,026 --> 01:41:59,584
It's Chromalux.

1265
01:42:02,064 --> 01:42:03,759
We just got a fax.

1266
01:42:03,865 --> 01:42:06,390
An incident
at the Brooklyn Museum.

1267
01:42:06,468 --> 01:42:09,460
A guy attacked two employees,
and get this...

1268
01:42:10,205 --> 01:42:12,139
ate the Blake painting.

1269
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:13,400
What?

1270
01:42:14,609 --> 01:42:16,873
That's him. It's got to be.

1271
01:42:17,245 --> 01:42:20,214
If that painting meant so much
to him, why destroy it?

1272
01:42:20,282 --> 01:42:22,944
And why didn't he kill
those two women at the museum?

1273
01:42:23,018 --> 01:42:24,815
They both got
a good look at him.

1274
01:42:27,956 --> 01:42:29,355
Maybe he's trying to stop.

1275
01:43:46,067 --> 01:43:48,365
Mr. Crawford,
all you've got is a hunch.

1276
01:43:48,437 --> 01:43:51,406
I've got 382 employees,
and they've got a union.

1277
01:43:51,473 --> 01:43:53,634
I can't just turn you loose
on their files.

1278
01:43:53,742 --> 01:43:55,232
Not without a court order.

1279
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:57,904
There are privacy issues.
The company's exposure.

1280
01:43:57,979 --> 01:44:00,447
One of the employees
has already killed 11 people...

1281
01:44:00,549 --> 01:44:01,607
that we know of.

1282
01:44:01,716 --> 01:44:03,149
If he gets away tonight...

1283
01:44:03,251 --> 01:44:04,809
what's the company's exposure
on that?

1284
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:08,219
- I'll get our lawyers here...
- We don't have time for that.

1285
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:09,279
Listen!

1286
01:44:09,391 --> 01:44:11,951
We're looking for a white male,
25 to 35...

1287
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:13,789
- right-handed with brown hair.
- No...

1288
01:44:13,895 --> 01:44:17,592
Listen! Please. He's strong.
He's possibly a bodybuilder.

1289
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:20,567
He might have some kind
of facial disfigurement.

1290
01:44:20,635 --> 01:44:23,126
He drives a van
or a panel truck.

1291
01:44:23,772 --> 01:44:25,171
That sounds like Mr. D.

1292
01:44:25,273 --> 01:44:26,433
Oh, my God.

1293
01:44:26,508 --> 01:44:27,941
Who's Mr. D?

1294
01:44:28,009 --> 01:44:30,500
Francis Dolarhyde,
Manager of Technical Services.

1295
01:44:30,612 --> 01:44:31,943
What does he do exactly?

1296
01:44:32,013 --> 01:44:34,311
He maintains the equipment
for tape transfers.

1297
01:44:34,416 --> 01:44:36,611
Would he have access
to people's home videotapes?

1298
01:44:36,685 --> 01:44:39,347
He has access to every tape
that comes through here.

1299
01:44:41,356 --> 01:44:43,950
Thanks for dinner,
and thanks for letting me vent.

1300
01:44:44,025 --> 01:44:45,788
Look, no problemo.

1301
01:44:47,896 --> 01:44:51,696
Reba, listen, I know it's not
my place to say this...

1302
01:44:53,468 --> 01:44:54,457
Go on.

1303
01:44:54,536 --> 01:44:58,302
Well, if Dolarhyde is really
as moody as you say he is...

1304
01:44:59,074 --> 01:45:00,803
maybe you ought
to keep some distance.

1305
01:45:00,876 --> 01:45:03,538
I mean, what do you really know
about the guy?

1306
01:45:03,979 --> 01:45:06,345
I appreciate
your concern, Ralph. Really.

1307
01:45:06,414 --> 01:45:09,713
And I promise
I'll give it some thought.

1308
01:45:12,153 --> 01:45:14,747
- Hey, have a great vacation.
- Thanks.

1309
01:45:15,257 --> 01:45:17,748
- See you in a week.
- Good night.

1310
01:45:31,172 --> 01:45:33,106
I had a great time.
Good night.

1311
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:34,607
Good night!

1312
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:07,606
Ralph, just 'cause
I'm feeling vulnerable...

1313
01:46:28,163 --> 01:46:29,460
Wake up.

1314
01:46:30,932 --> 01:46:35,665
You wandered around in the house
while I was asleep, didn't you?

1315
01:46:35,770 --> 01:46:36,759
What?

1316
01:46:36,838 --> 01:46:39,830
The other night,
did you find something odd?

1317
01:46:41,343 --> 01:46:45,109
Did you take it and show it
to somebody? Did you do that?

1318
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,680
D? What is it?

1319
01:46:47,949 --> 01:46:49,644
What's happening?

1320
01:46:50,452 --> 01:46:53,114
- Sit still or he'll hear us!
- Who will?

1321
01:46:53,188 --> 01:46:54,780
He's upstairs.

1322
01:46:57,993 --> 01:46:59,790
He wants you, Reba.

1323
01:47:01,963 --> 01:47:04,488
I thought he was gone,
but now he's back.

1324
01:47:04,566 --> 01:47:06,431
D, you're scaring me.

1325
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:11,761
I didn't want
to give you to him.

1326
01:47:12,173 --> 01:47:15,609
I did a thing for you today
so he couldn't have you.

1327
01:47:16,711 --> 01:47:18,178
I was wrong.

1328
01:47:19,581 --> 01:47:23,210
You made me weak
and then you hurt me.

1329
01:47:45,106 --> 01:47:46,198
No.

1330
01:47:47,475 --> 01:47:49,636
No, you can't have her!

1331
01:47:50,445 --> 01:47:52,743
Please don't let him have me.

1332
01:47:53,548 --> 01:47:54,913
You won't.

1333
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:57,117
I'm for you.

1334
01:47:57,652 --> 01:48:00,985
You like me. I know you like me.
Take me with you.

1335
01:48:03,625 --> 01:48:07,322
Take you with me?
Yes. Put out your hand.

1336
01:48:07,462 --> 01:48:09,930
Feel this. That's a shotgun.

1337
01:48:10,065 --> 01:48:13,125
A 12-gauge magnum.
Do you know what it'll do?

1338
01:48:14,069 --> 01:48:17,664
I wish I could have trusted you.
I wanted to trust you.

1339
01:48:19,007 --> 01:48:21,441
You felt so good!

1340
01:48:22,177 --> 01:48:23,644
So did you.

1341
01:48:25,547 --> 01:48:29,813
- Please don't hurt me now.
- It's all over for me.

1342
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:43,222
- Where are you?
- I can't leave you to him.

1343
01:48:43,298 --> 01:48:46,199
Do you know what he'll do?
He'll bite you to death.

1344
01:48:46,301 --> 01:48:50,169
He'll hurt you so bad!
I can't let that happen.

1345
01:48:50,705 --> 01:48:54,698
- It's better if you go with me.
- Yes, God, get us out of here!

1346
01:48:54,909 --> 01:48:58,811
- I'll shoot you and then myself.
- Oh, no.

1347
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:01,212
- I have to shoot you.
- No...

1348
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:10,014
I can't do it.

1349
01:49:16,765 --> 01:49:17,754
D!

1350
01:49:41,656 --> 01:49:43,317
Three steps to the clock.

1351
01:49:43,424 --> 01:49:45,915
From the clock to the door,
nine more.

1352
01:49:46,961 --> 01:49:48,258
Oh, God.

1353
01:49:53,468 --> 01:49:56,096
What is that?
What the hell is that?

1354
01:49:56,404 --> 01:49:58,099
That's the place.

1355
01:49:58,173 --> 01:49:59,572
Goddamn it!

1356
01:49:59,641 --> 01:50:01,768
All units,
that's his house that's burning.

1357
01:50:19,294 --> 01:50:20,488
FBI!

1358
01:50:20,795 --> 01:50:23,628
Francis Dolarhyde! Where is he?

1359
01:50:23,998 --> 01:50:26,125
He's in there. He is dead.

1360
01:50:26,367 --> 01:50:27,561
You know that?

1361
01:50:27,669 --> 01:50:30,229
He shot himself in the face.
I put my hand in it.

1362
01:50:30,338 --> 01:50:33,466
He set fire to the house.
He was on the floor, and l...

1363
01:50:51,259 --> 01:50:52,590
You all right?

1364
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,169
That's all I need.

1365
01:51:07,242 --> 01:51:09,233
I'd like to come back
before I leave town.

1366
01:51:09,344 --> 01:51:11,904
See how you're doing.
Sure, why not?

1367
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,674
Who could resist a charmer like me?

1368
01:51:16,784 --> 01:51:20,618
You know, whatever part of him
was still human...

1369
01:51:20,722 --> 01:51:23,282
was only kept alive
because of you.

1370
01:51:23,625 --> 01:51:25,286
You probably saved some lives.

1371
01:51:26,928 --> 01:51:29,123
You didn't draw a freak. Okay?

1372
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:31,596
You drew a man
with a freak on his back.

1373
01:51:34,168 --> 01:51:35,999
I should have known.

1374
01:51:36,104 --> 01:51:40,905
No, sometimes you don't.
Trust me, I've been there.

1375
01:51:43,945 --> 01:51:47,403
Listen to me. There was
plenty wrong with Dolarhyde...

1376
01:51:47,482 --> 01:51:49,279
but there's nothing wrong
with you.

1377
01:51:51,286 --> 01:51:52,514
Except your hair.

1378
01:51:54,589 --> 01:51:56,113
Your hair is a train wreck.

1379
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:58,124
Can we please
do something about that?

1380
01:51:58,192 --> 01:52:00,456
For next time, maybe? Please?

1381
01:52:02,163 --> 01:52:03,653
That would be nice.

1382
01:52:03,765 --> 01:52:06,097
Thank you.
Just get some rest.

1383
01:52:06,267 --> 01:52:08,132
You're gonna be fine.

1384
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:17,003
Dr. Voss,
please call Pharmacy 4421.

1385
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:21,205
We found this in his safe.

1386
01:52:21,316 --> 01:52:23,375
Thought you might
want to take the first look.

1387
01:52:23,484 --> 01:52:24,849
You've earned it.

1388
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:58,114
When I read hisjournal,
it was sad.

1389
01:52:59,187 --> 01:53:01,018
It was just so sad.

1390
01:53:03,091 --> 01:53:05,855
I couldn't help
feeling sorry for him.

1391
01:53:07,895 --> 01:53:10,625
He wasn't born a monster.

1392
01:53:10,798 --> 01:53:14,427
This guy was made one
through years of abuse.

1393
01:53:14,736 --> 01:53:17,364
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad, can we make s'mores?

1394
01:53:17,739 --> 01:53:19,764
- S'mores?
- Yeah, s'mores.

1395
01:53:20,274 --> 01:53:22,299
- Yeah, you're on.
- All right.

1396
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:24,435
- Go look in the pantry.
- Okay.

1397
01:53:33,287 --> 01:53:34,311
Crawford.

1398
01:53:34,422 --> 01:53:36,413
Those remains you found
in the rubble.

1399
01:53:36,491 --> 01:53:39,324
- They're not Dolarhyde's.
- What are you talking about?

1400
01:53:39,761 --> 01:53:42,525
- His damn dentures were there.
- But not his bones.

1401
01:53:42,597 --> 01:53:43,859
Wrong DNA.

1402
01:53:43,931 --> 01:53:45,262
Then whose are they?

1403
01:53:45,366 --> 01:53:47,266
Saint Louis P.D.
is looking for...

1404
01:53:47,368 --> 01:53:49,336
a Chromalux employee
named Ralph Mandy.

1405
01:53:49,404 --> 01:53:52,703
He should be on vacation,
so nobody missed him for a week.

1406
01:53:54,108 --> 01:53:56,668
- What is taking him so long?
- Are you kidding?

1407
01:53:56,744 --> 01:54:00,111
It takes him 20 minutes to get
out of bed in the morning.

1408
01:54:00,214 --> 01:54:03,513
Yeah, but now I have
a serious marshmallow jones.

1409
01:54:12,126 --> 01:54:14,219
Josh, what are you doing?

1410
01:54:26,474 --> 01:54:29,637
We can't come to the
phone. You know the deal.

1411
01:54:29,744 --> 01:54:31,507
Wait for the beep.

1412
01:54:33,114 --> 01:54:36,811
It's Jack.
It's Dolarhyde. He's still alive.

1413
01:54:37,318 --> 01:54:39,650
I'm scrambling everything
that rolls or flies...

1414
01:54:39,754 --> 01:54:41,449
but they'll take time to arrive.

1415
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:43,248
Will?

1416
01:54:44,358 --> 01:54:46,326
Christ, Will, where are you?

1417
01:55:43,784 --> 01:55:46,685
Drop it. Do it now, gumshoe.

1418
01:55:51,692 --> 01:55:53,956
Your son is about to change.

1419
01:55:55,163 --> 01:55:56,721
Then your wife.

1420
01:55:57,732 --> 01:55:59,290
You can watch.

1421
01:56:00,134 --> 01:56:02,034
Then I'll take care ofyou.

1422
01:56:05,173 --> 01:56:06,640
Look at you.

1423
01:56:06,974 --> 01:56:11,035
I've never seen
a child as disgusting as you!

1424
01:56:11,312 --> 01:56:13,906
You pissed your pants?
How dare you!

1425
01:56:15,850 --> 01:56:19,183
You dirty little beast.
You want me to cut it off?

1426
01:56:20,021 --> 01:56:21,886
Want me to do that,
you little freak?

1427
01:56:21,956 --> 01:56:23,218
You want me to cut it off?

1428
01:56:23,291 --> 01:56:26,727
Do you? Don't cry at me,
you little faggot!

1429
01:56:27,295 --> 01:56:31,755
Apologize! Say, "I'm sorry,
Daddy! I'm a dirty little beast.

1430
01:56:32,466 --> 01:56:34,593
"I'm a freak." Say it!

1431
01:56:34,702 --> 01:56:35,862
- No.
- Say it!

1432
01:56:35,937 --> 01:56:38,462
- Dad!
- Say it, or I will cut it off!

1433
01:56:38,606 --> 01:56:41,268
"I'm a dirty little beast.

1434
01:56:41,375 --> 01:56:43,275
"Freak! Harelip!

1435
01:56:43,377 --> 01:56:45,607
"And no one will ever love me."

1436
01:56:47,481 --> 01:56:49,244
Josh, run! Run!

1437
01:56:58,659 --> 01:56:59,990
Get down!

1438
01:57:01,963 --> 01:57:03,294
You okay?

1439
01:57:20,147 --> 01:57:22,172
Josh?
Mom?

1440
01:57:22,617 --> 01:57:23,777
Will?

1441
01:57:25,286 --> 01:57:27,083
Where are you guys?

1442
01:57:29,090 --> 01:57:31,024
I thought I heard
some kind of...

1443
01:57:33,027 --> 01:57:34,187
Will?

1444
01:57:35,096 --> 01:57:36,757
Molly, get down!

1445
01:57:50,778 --> 01:57:51,938
Will!

1446
01:58:04,725 --> 01:58:06,056
Shoot...

1447
01:58:07,962 --> 01:58:08,894
What?

1448
01:58:08,996 --> 01:58:10,896
Shoot him. Shoot him.

1449
01:58:28,482 --> 01:58:29,676
Mommy?

1450
01:58:42,997 --> 01:58:45,864
You must be healed by now.

1451
01:58:46,567 --> 01:58:48,660
On the outside, at least.

1452
01:58:48,769 --> 01:58:50,999
I hope you're not too ugly.

1453
01:58:51,105 --> 01:58:53,733
What a collection ofscars
you have!

1454
01:58:53,874 --> 01:58:56,104
Never forget
who gave you the best of them.

1455
01:58:56,210 --> 01:58:57,609
And be grateful.

1456
01:58:57,712 --> 01:59:01,671
Our scars have the power
to remind us the past was real.

1457
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:05,018
We live in a primitive time,
don't we, Will?

1458
01:59:05,086 --> 01:59:07,213
Neither savage nor wise.

1459
01:59:07,288 --> 01:59:08,915
Half measures
are the curse of it.

1460
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:13,286
A rational society would either
kill me or put me to some use.

1461
01:59:15,863 --> 01:59:18,957
Do you dream much, Will?
I think ofyou often.

1462
01:59:20,134 --> 01:59:22,898
Your old friend,
Hannibal Lecter.

1463
01:59:41,956 --> 01:59:44,151
Hannibal?
There's someone here to see you.

1464
01:59:44,458 --> 01:59:47,791
Wants to ask a few questions.
I said you'd probably refuse.

1465
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:52,495
A young woman.
Says she's from the FBI.

1466
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:55,592
Though she's far too pretty,
if you ask me.

1467
01:59:56,904 --> 01:59:59,065
I'll tell her you said no.

1468
02:00:04,645 --> 02:00:06,340
What is her name?
