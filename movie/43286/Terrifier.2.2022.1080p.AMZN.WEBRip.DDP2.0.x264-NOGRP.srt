﻿我就是说 你有没有考虑过
I- Tm just saying, did you ever consider

483
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,852
﻿更合理的解释是那场大火导致了噩梦
the logical explanation that maybe the fire

484
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,521
﻿而不是噩梦导致了大火
caused your nightmare, not the other way around?

485
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,272
﻿什么
What?

488
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,167
﻿我认为在你睡着的时候房间起火了
I think that the fire started while you were sleeping.

489

﻿火一路烧进你的梦里
And it worked its way into your nightmare.

490
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,088
﻿意思是说 你的身体肯定感受到火焰了
I mean, your body must've felt the flames.

491

﻿发生这种破事很正常
You know shit like that happens all the time.

I mean, what are- what are we doing here?

494
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,767
﻿就算你说的是真的
Even if that is the case,

495
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,560
﻿火灾的起因也没得到解释
it doesn't explain how the fire started.
