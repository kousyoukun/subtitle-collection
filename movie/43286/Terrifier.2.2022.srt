1
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,616
你怎么了?你从哪弄来的?
What's wrong with you? Where did you even get that?

2
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,351
约翰尼，你在干什么?
Johnny, what are you doing?

3
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,008
911有什么紧急情况?
9-1-1, what is your emergency?

4
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,713
喂?9-1-1。
Hello? 9-1-1.

5
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,552
你有急事吗?
Do you have an emergency?

6
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,687
先生，你能说话吗?
Sir, can you speak?

7
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,924
如果你不能说话，按手机上的任何按钮。
If you can't speak, press any button on your phone.

8
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,026
一次代表是，两次代表否。
Once for yes, twice for no.

9
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,830
你还在吗?
Are you still there?

10
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:18,004
先生，请不要挂断，好吗?我会追踪你的位置。
Sir, I want you to stay on the line for me, okay? I'm gonna track your location.

11
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,346
你还在听吗?
Are you still with me?

12
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,549
喂?
Hello?

13
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,884
你还在吗?
Are you still there?

14
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,958
好的，彼得森路129号，迈尔斯县停尸房。
Okay. 129, Peterson Drive, Miles County Morgue.

15
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,361
先生，你还在听吗?
Sir, are you still with me?

16
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,797
坐好，保持冷静。
Just sit tight and remain calm.

17
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,568
警察和医护人员正在赶来的路上
Police and paramedics are on their way...

18
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,712
♬你并不孤单
♪ You're not alone ♪

19
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,404
♬你并不孤单
♪ You're not alone ♪

20
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,149
♬你并不孤单
♪ You're not alone ♪

21
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,353
夫人,我明白了。
Ma'am, I understand.

22
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,055
但我不能给你这个信息。
But I can't give you that information.

23
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,492
保单上只有你丈夫一个人。
Your husband's the only one listed on the policy.

24
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,727
母狗!
Bitch!

25
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,896
不，夫人，不是你。不是你。
No, ma'am, not you. Not you.

26
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,598
妈妈，我们没有卷尺吗?
Mom, don't we have a tape measure?

27
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,532
我不知道。
I don't know.

28
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,067
检查微波炉旁边的抽屉。
Check the drawer by the microwave.

29
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,836
是的,女士!
Yes, ma'am!

30
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:43,776
我明白，但将来，你丈夫得打电话给保险公司。
I understand that, but in the future, your husband's going to have to call the policy.

31
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,547
我只能告诉你它还在活动。
All I can tell you is that it's still active.

32
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,750
是的。
Yes.

33
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,453
嗯。
Mmhmm.

34
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,289
你能等五分钟，去把你弟弟叫来吗?
Can you wait five minutes, and go get your brother, please?

35
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,290
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,362
我的经纪人也会跟你说同样的话。
My manager is just gonna tell you the same thing.

37
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,633
你想好明天要穿什么了吗?
So, did you figure out what you're dressing up as tomorrow?

38
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,702
迈尔斯郡的小丑。
The Miles County clown.

39
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,371
-别这么做。——为什么不呢?
- Don't do that. - Why not?

40
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,306
因为这已经超越了不尊重。
Because that's beyond disrespectful.

41
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,608
我们在说什么?
What are we talking about?

42
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,045
他想打扮成去年杀了九个人的真凶。
He wants to dress up as a real guy who murdered nine people last year.

43
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,614
你知道这有多麻木不仁吗?
Do you have any idea how insensitive that is?

44
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,149
更不用说，恶心了。
Not to mention, sick.

45
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,785
-你不能这么做-这只是一套服装
- Oh, you're not doing that. - It's just a costume.

46
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:32,990
如果上帝保佑，他袭击了我们家的人，而人们为他庆祝，你会作何感想?
How would you feel if God forbid, he attacked someone in our family, and people celebrated him?

47
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,291
这就是你所做的。
That's basically what you're doing.

48
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,327
你不会看到有人打扮成杰弗里·达莫或查尔斯·曼森。
You don't see people dressing up as Jeffrey Dahmer or Charles Manson.

49
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,896
我觉得你们俩都反应过度了。
I think you're both overreacting.

50
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,130
你呢?
Do you?

51
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,266
严格来说，查尔斯·曼森从未杀过人。
Charles Manson technically never killed anyone.

52
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,134
好吧，好吧。足够了。
All right, all right. Enough.

53
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,172
我说，“不”，就这样了。
I said, "No," and that's it.

54
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:53,010
你知道吗，纳粹曾经给孩子的眼球注射，看他们会不会变色?
Did you know that Nazis used to inject children's eyeballs to see if they would change color?

55
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,278
乔纳森!
Jonathan!

56
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,314
谢谢你！
Thank you.

57
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,988
你明天有什么计划?
So, what are your plans tomorrow?

58
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,824
梅根·梅兰妮要办万圣节派对。
Megan Melanie's throwing a Halloween party.

59
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,592
这很好。
That's nice.

60
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,627
你和谁一起去，艾丽?
Who are you going with, Allie?

61
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,629
和布鲁克。
And Brooke.

62
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,933
她不会开车吧?
She's not driving, is she?

63
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,301
我要搭优步。
I'm gonna take an Uber.

64
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,169
为什么，好让你喝得烂醉吗?
Why, so you can get shitfaced?

65
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,438
你以为我是谁，傻瓜，西耶娜?
Who do you think I am, stupid, Sienna?

66
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,007
每次我出去都要这样吗?
Do we have to do this every time I go out?

67
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,642
你知道我不喝酒的。
You know I don't drink.

68
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,544
所以你说。
So you say.

69
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,287
你哥哥从来不合这些该死的盒子。
Your brother never closes these goddamn boxes.

70
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,724
给我。我得到了它。
Give me that. I got it.

71
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:49,869
妈妈，你有没有…想知道乔纳森吗?
Mom, do you ever... wonder about Jonathan?

72
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,170
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

73
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,340
你知道,他是……
You know, he's...

74
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,821
-他是个怪人。——所以,什么?
- He's an oddball. - So, what?

75
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,057
我之前去他房间的时候他在查连环杀手。
He was looking up serial killers when I went in his room before.

76
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,660
现在,他是…他说的是纳粹和大屠杀。
Now, he's... he's talking about Nazis and the Holocaust.

77
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,530
——我的意思是……-这只是个阶段，西耶娜
- I mean... - It's just a phase, Sienna.

78
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,833
它会通过。
It'll pass.

79
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,903
你一年前就这么说了。
You said that a year ago.

80
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,282
是啊，他失去了父亲。
Yeah, well, he lost his father.

81
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,750
和我没有?
And I didn't?

82
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,419
你没见过我渴望别人的关注。
You don't see me crying out for attention.

83
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,922
是啊，我有时也希望你这么做。
Yeah, well, I wish you would from time to time.

84
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,791
你把一切都憋在心里。这是不健康的。
You keep everything bottled up. It's not healthy.

85
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,426
好吧。
All right.

86
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,929
如果你在他的房间里发现一只动物的尸体，不要惊讶。
Just don't be surprised if you find a dead animal in his room.

87
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,732
你知道吗?说话客气点，好吗?
You know what? Watch your mouth, huh?

88
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,620
那你呢?
And what about you?

89
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:21,625
当爸爸带你去钓那些米多或麦多的时候。
When Daddy took you fishing for those midos or macos.

90
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,759
小鱼。
Minnows.

91
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,461
不管他们。
Whatever they're called.

92
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,798
他发现你在砍头。
And he found you cutting the heads off.

93
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,967
你以为我不记得了吗?
Didn't think I'd remember that, did you?

94
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,768
我比乔纳森小得多。
I was a lot younger than Jonathan.

95
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,472
你已经大到能分辨是非了。
Well, you were old enough to know the difference between right and wrong.

96
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,475
你的兄弟很好。
Your brother's fine.

97
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,134
你有强力胶吗?
Do you have any Super Glue?

98
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,441
一点。
A little.

99
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,146
-怎么了，怎么了?-绳子掉了。
- Why, what happened? - The string came off.

100
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,214
我以为你明天不会穿这个。
I thought you weren't gonna wear this tomorrow.

101
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,383
那我就不画脸了。
I won't paint my face then.

102
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,353
——乔纳森。- - - - - -来吧。
- Jonathan. - Come on.

103
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,956
现在换服装太晚了。
It's too late to get another costume.

104
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,158
给我。
Give me.

105
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,463
耶稣。怎么，晚餐后你又长了一只脚吗?
Jesus. What, did you grow another foot since dinner?

106
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,632
我们班最高的孩子。
Tallest kid in my class.

107
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,901
是啊，我还是可以揍你的。
Yeah, well, I can still kick your ass.

108
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:38,903
不会持续太久。
Not for long.

109
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,740
这是生病。
That is sick.

110
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,512
-你还剩多少钱?-正在完成头骨的制作
- How much do you have left? - Just finishing up the skull.

111
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,380
它看起来就像爸爸的角色。
It looks just like Daddy's character.

112
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,548
你知道吗?
You know?

113
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,884
你现在画得几乎和他一样好了。
You draw almost as good as him now.

114
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:54,920
谢谢。
Thanks.

115
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,727
这也是你服装的一部分吗?
Is this a part of your costume, too?

116
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,530
不。我不能戴着那东西上街。
No. I could not walk out in the streets with that thing.

117
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,998
我马上就会被逮捕。
I'd get arrested in like two seconds.

118
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,833
是的。但没人会惹你。
Yeah. But nobody would mess with you.

119
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,168
-那当然。——好吧。
- That's for sure. - Right.

120
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,706
请一定要小心。刀片像剃刀一样锋利。
Just be careful, please. That blade's like razor sharp.

121
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,578
给。现在应该没问题了。
There. Should be good now.

122
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
太棒了。
Awesome.

123
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,251
你觉得那家伙还逍遥法外吗?
You think that guy's still out there?

124
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,187
谁?
Who?

125
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,423
迈尔斯郡的小丑。
The Miles County clown.

126
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,624
你和这个小丑是怎么回事?
What's up with you and this clown all of a sudden?

127
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,293
你就像着了魔一样。
You're like obsessed.

128
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,095
他们一直没找到他的尸体。
They never found his body.

129
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,730
如果他决定回到这里呢?
What if he decides to come back here?

130
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,698
所以你才想打扮成他的样子吗?
Is that why you wanna dress up like him?

131
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,469
你觉得如果他看到你穿他的戏服，他会对你很友好吗?
You think if he sees you wearing his costume, he'll be all cordial with you?

132
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,471
亲切?
Cordial?

133
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,573
友好。
Friendly.

134
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,274
不。
No.

135
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,943
我不会担心的。
I wouldn't worry about it.

136
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,694
他可能还活着，我敢肯定他已经离开这里很远了。
On the off chance that he is still alive, I'm sure he's gone far away from here.

137
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,454
-再次感谢你的帽子。——不客气。
- Thanks again for the hat. - You're welcome.

138
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,498
利用较低。
Tap lower down.

139

你，去那边，喂这个人。

Shit.

186
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,407
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

187
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,711
——妈妈!——得到楼下!
- Mom! - Get downstairs!

188
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,181
耶稣基督!
Jesus Christ!

189
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,718
妈妈，你在做什么?来吧!
Mom, what are you doing? Come on!

190
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,563
真的,Sienna?
Really, Sienna?

191
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:17,200
你整晚都在梳妆台上点蜡烛?
You left burning candles on your dresser all night?

192
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,735
你他妈傻吗?
What are you, fucking stupid?

193
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,104
我什么都没做。他们不是点燃。
I didn't do anything. They weren't lit.

194
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,507
那就跟我解释一下你的房间是怎么着火的。
Then please explain to me how your goddamn room caught on fire.

195
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,909
-我不知道。-你不知道。
- I have no idea. - You have no idea.

196
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,613
所以它是凭空自燃的吗?
So, it just spontaneously combusted out of thin air?

197
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:36,686
-我想是的。-Sienna…回床上去。你早上还要上学。
- I guess so. - Sienna... Get back to bed. You have school in the morning.

198
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,424
-你是说我还得走?-我说什么了?
- You mean I still have to go? - What did I say?

199
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,693
你知道吗，西耶娜?
You know what, Sienna?

200
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:51,901
你总有一天会杀了我们的，用你的化学药品和热风枪，熬夜到凌晨4点，鬼知道你在做什么!
You are going to kill us one of these days, between your chemicals and your heat guns, and staying up until 4:00 in the fucking morning doing God only knows what!

201
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:57,375
哦,我的上帝。我说过一百次了，我没有使用化学药品，也没有在梳妆台上留下燃烧的蜡烛!
Oh, my God. For the hundredth time, I was not using chemicals and I did not leave burning candles on my dresser!

202
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,779
-你为什么就不能相信我?——因为……
- Why can't you just believe me? - Because...

203
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:07,450
今晚住我房间，我睡沙发。
Stay in my room tonight, and I'll sleep on the couch.

204
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,419
我不介意睡在沙发上。
I don't mind sleeping on the couch.

205
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,421
去睡觉。
Go to bed.

206
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,212
最下面抽屉里的东西我都留着。
I kept whatever was in the bottom drawer.

207
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,516
大部分都毁了。
Most of it's ruined.

208
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,852
回家后一定要把车停在车库里。
Make sure you park in the garage when you get home.

209
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:54,190
隔壁的那些动物总是扔鸡蛋和剃须膏。
Those animals next door are always throwing eggs and shaving cream.

210
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,361
我不想让车被刮坏。
I don't want the car getting scratched up.

211
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,564
你知道爸爸给我的剑吗?
You know the sword Daddy got me?

212
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,566
什么呢?
What about it?

213
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,571
昨晚还放在我梳妆台上。
It was on top of my dresser last night.

214
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,742
好吧，也许它可以修复。
Well, maybe it can be restored.

215
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,377
是坏的吗?
Is it bad?

216
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,913
它很好。
It's fine.

217
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,915
上面一点痕迹也没有。
There's not a mark on it.

218
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,683
这很好。
That's good.

219
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,852
你的衣服就不一样了。
Can't say the same for your clothes.

220
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,856
乔纳森,快点。你有五分钟的时间。
Jonathan, hurry up. You have five minutes.

221
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,847
欢迎回到我们的节目。
Welcome back to the program.

222
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:32,321
如果你正在收看，我正在与迈尔斯县大屠杀的唯一幸存者现场直播，就在一年前的今天。
If you're just tuning in, I'm sitting here live with the sole survivor of the Miles County massacre, which occurred exactly one year ago today.

223
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:38,494
我在这个节目里工作了很多年，我从来没有和一个像你这么有故事的人面对面坐过。
I've worked on the show for many years, and I've never sat across from someone who has a story to tell quite like yours.

224
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:43,099
再次感谢您花时间坐下来与我交谈。-我的荣幸。
Thank you again for taking the time to sit down - and speak with me. - It's my pleasure.

225
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:47,470
当我们结束的时候，我们说的是你从昏迷中醒来的那一刻。
Now, when we left off, we were talking about the moment you woke up from the coma.

226
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,306
你还记得你第一次看到你的脸时的第一反应吗?
Do you remember your initial reaction when you first saw your face?

227
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,841
是的。
Yes.

228
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,344
你愿意和我们分享一下吗?
Would you like to share that with us?

229
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,014
我希望我已经死了。
I wished I was dead.

230
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,249
你现在还有这种感觉吗?
Do you still feel that way?

231
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,820
人们会被我的长相吓到，尤其是孩子们。
People are frightened by the way that I look, especially children.

232
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:09,627
这对我来说真的很难处理，所以隔离是理想的。
And it's really difficult for me to deal with that, so isolation is ideal.

233
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,629
那么袭击者呢?
Now, what about your attacker?

234
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,400
这名男子只被确认为小丑阿特。
The man only identified as Art the Clown.

235
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,036
关于他所谓的死亡有很多争议。
Well, there's a lot of controversy surrounding his supposed death.

236
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:25,374
当局发表了一份声明，声称他的尸体在袭击发生后的第二天早上从县验尸官办公室消失了。
The authorities issued a statement, claiming that his body disappeared from the county coroner's office the morning after the attack.

237
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,845
他死了。我亲眼看到了。
He's dead. I saw it happen.

238
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,262
-你们在干什么?-伙计，看看肖恩找到了什么
- What are you guys doing? - Dude, look what Sean found.

239
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,432
这是新的吉祥物。
It's the new mascot.

240
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,367
哦,男人。
Oh, man.

241
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,670
正合你胃口，对吧，J兄弟?
Right up your alley, huh, J man?

242
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,105
我想知道它是怎么死的。
I wonder how it died.

243
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,387
可能是吃了学校的烘肉卷。
Probably had the school meatloaf.

244
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,343
我觉得你还是别管了。
I think you should leave it alone.

245
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:03,279
对什么?他没介意。
What for? He doesn't mind.

246
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,613
它是如此恶心。
It's so gross.

247
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,881
老兄，你应该来的。
Dude, you should have been here.

248
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,183
有几只鸟在吃他的屁眼。
Couple of birds were eating his asshole.

249
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,185
是的。
Yeah.

250
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,056
看这个。斯蒂芬妮!
Watch this. Stephanie!

251
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,292
斯蒂芬妮!过来一下。
Stephanie! Come here for a minute.

252
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,227
肖恩,来吧。
Sean, come on.

253
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,397
一定会很棒的。
It's gonna be awesome.

254
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,199
——怎么了?-看看。
- What's up? - Check it out.

255
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,368
有只猫在垃圾箱后面生了孩子。
Some cat just gave birth behind the dumpster.

256
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,535
——真的吗?-是的。
- Really? - Yeah.

257
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,373
去看看所有的小猫。
Go look at all the kittens.

258
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:37,748
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

259
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,753
怎么了?蛆虫也需要爱!
What's wrong? Maggots need love, too!

260
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,254
斯蒂芬妮!
Stephanie!

261
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,289
你能吗?
Can you?

262
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,625
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

263
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:50,628
哦,狗屎。普林西比女士。
Oh, shit. Ms. Principe.

264
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,332
你们在这里做什么?
What are you boys doing back here?

265
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,000
哦,基督。亨德森先生。
Oh, Christ. Mr. Henderson.

266
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,502
——什么都没有。——真的吗?
- Nothing. - Really?

267
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,772
你现在就去找柯蒂斯先生，让他把那个搬走。
You go find Mr. Curtis right now, and you have him move that.

268
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,974
你们两个，去上课。
And you two, get to class.

269
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,477
移动它!
Move it!

270
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,675
乔纳森。
Jonathan.

271
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,213
把眼睛盯在自己的纸上。
Keep your eyes on your own paper.

272
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,583
惠伦先生。
Mr. Whalen.

273
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,486
我可以离开一下吗?
May I be excused?

274
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,221
等待。我想我忘带短裤了。
Wait. I think I forgot my shorts.

275
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,989
我想我有一双多余的。
I think I have an extra pair.

276
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,991
你有多余的衬衫吗?——我可能。
- Do you have an extra shirt? - I might.

277
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,860
我们可以去洗手间…
We can go to the bathroom...

278
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,972
嘿!不要在走廊里跑步!
Hey! No running in the hallways!

279
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,075
乔纳森，给我回来!
Jonathan, get back here!

280
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,287
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

281
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
万圣节快乐，我的宝贝。
Happy Halloween, my pretty.

282
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,598
-吃巧克力太早了吧?
- Little early for chocolate, no? - Mm.

283
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,335
我可是一个经常吃巧克力伯爵的人。
You're talking to someone who eats Count Chocula on a regular basis.

284
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,404
我们能不谈麦片吗?
Can we not talk about cereal?

285
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,505
好吗?
Please?

286
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,608
好的。
Okay.

287
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,911
今天早上有人心情不好。
Someone's in a mood this morning.

288
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,413
对不起。
Sorry.

289
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,183
昨晚几乎没睡。
Barely slept last night.

290
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,450
让我猜一猜。
Let me guess.

291
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:06,257
你熬夜到凌晨四点，又在做万圣节服装。
You were up until 4:00 in the morning, working on that Halloween costume again.

292
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,460
实际上，应该是6点。
Actually, it was more like 6:00.

293
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,596
你们听说今早莫妮卡·布朗的事了吗?
Did you guys hear about Monica Brown this morning?

294
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,531
啊!那个恶毒的脱口秀主持人?
Ugh! That bitchy talk show host?

295
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,701
是啊，那个贱人脱口秀主持人的脸完全被扯掉了。
Yeah, that bitchy talk show host totally got her face torn off.

296
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,436
什么?
What?

297
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,604
好的,得到这个。
Okay, get this.

298
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,205
所以她把迈尔斯县的那个幸存者带在身上了。
So, she had that Miles County survivor on.

299
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,508
你还记得那个昏迷不醒脸全是残的人吗?她叫什么名字?
Do you remember the one who was in the coma and her face was all mutilated? What's her name?

300
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,644
就像，我不知道，维多利亚之类的。
It was like, I don't know, Victoria or something.

301
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,679
——维多利亚嘿?——是的。
- Victoria Heyes? - Yes.

302
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,348
她在节目上崩溃了，对吧?
She had a meltdown on the show, right?

303
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:37,686
然后在后台，她发疯了，徒手撕扯了莫妮卡·布朗。
And then backstage, she went full-on psycho, and mauled Monica Brown with her bare hands.

304
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,624
——没有。-我的天啊。
- No way. - Oh, my God.

305
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,225
她死了吗?
Is she dead?

306
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,327
我是说，如果她够幸运的话。
I mean, if she's lucky.

307
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,698
什么?你见过那些移植面部的照片吗，看起来像土豆头先生?
What? You ever see photos of those transplant faces, looking like Mr. Potato Head?

308
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,301
-去他妈的。-天啊，真的那么糟糕吗?
- Fuck that shit. - God, is it really that bad?

309
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,235
我还没看到照片呢。
Well, I haven't seen photos.

310
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:57,239
但据我所知，她有点像我饼干里的东西。
But from what I hear, she kinda looks like the inside of my cookie.

311
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,241
她的眼睛全被挖出来了。
Her eyes are all gouged out.

312
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,410
她的鼻子就像从脸上掉下来一样。
And her nose was like falling off of her face.

313
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,711
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

314
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:08,517
我听说她的脸颊有点像，是在维多利亚·海斯的鞋底发现的。
And I heard that her cheek like a little bit, was found at the bottom of Victoria Heyes' shoe.

315
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,719
你没事吧?
You okay?

316
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,223
Sienna?

317
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:20,996
嘿，你没事吧?
Hey, you all right?

318
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,998
我真的不想用莫妮卡·布朗的破事吓到你。
I really didn't mean to freak you out with that Monica Brown shit.

319
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,400
-很抱歉。——没有。
- I'm so sorry. - No.

320
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,435
——你明白吗?-我没事，我没事我很好。
- You okay? - I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm fine.

321
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:30,072
我只是…我想我需要点时间。
I just... I just need a second I think.

322
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,209
你好。原谅我。
Hi. Excuse me.

323
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,211
你能管好你自己的事吗?
Can you mind your own business, please?

324
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,180
谢谢你！
Thank you.

325
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,749
我的上帝。西耶娜，跟我说话。
My God. Sienna, talk to me.

326
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,751
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

327
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,221
我们有…昨晚我们家发生了火灾。
We had... we had a fire last night.

328
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,891
——什么?在哪里?——我的房间。
- What? Where? - My room.

329
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,961
我一定是点着蜡烛睡着了。
I must've fallen asleep with the candles burning.

330
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,431
-非常糟糕。——好的。“相当糟糕”有多糟糕?
- It was pretty bad. - Okay. How bad is "pretty bad"?

331
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:59,568
就像火焰接触到天花板一样，整座房子都有可能被烧毁。
Like flames touching the ceiling, entire house could have burned down bad.

332
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,905
——耶稣。每个人都好吗?-是的。是的,是的。
- Jesus. Is everyone okay? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

333
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,773
不，我妈及时把火扑灭了。
No, my mom put the flames out in time.

334
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,709
哇。他妈的芭芭拉来拯救我们。
Wow. Fucking Barbara to the rescue.

335
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,777
我发誓那女人是个超级英雄。
I swear that woman's a superhero.

336
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,580
-她生气了吗?——愤怒。
- Was she pissed? - Livid.

337
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,483
今天早上训斥了我整整一个半小时。
Berated me for a good hour and a half this morning.

338
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,584
我的意思是，这并不坏。
I mean, that's not so bad.

339
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,320
我是说，你差点在他们睡觉的时候烧了他们全家。
I mean, you did almost torch the whole family in their sleep.

340
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,423
看。重要的是没人受伤。对吧?
Look. The important thing is that nobody got hurt. Right?

341
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:25,227
说真的，几周后，你会嘲笑整件事的。-更像是几个月。
Seriously, in a few weeks, you'll be laughing - about the whole thing. - More like months.

342
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,732
——好的。几个月。-大概一年吧。
- Okay. A couple months. - Probably a year.

343
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,467
这不仅仅是火灾。
It wasn't just the fire.

344
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,238
它……
It...

345
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,478
昨晚发生了很奇怪的事。
Something really strange happened last night.

346
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
什么?
What?

347
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,653
没什么。没什么。我很好。
Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine.

348
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:55,023
-你确定?-是的。是的。
- You sure? - Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,529
是啊，别这样。嗯…让我们……让我们回去。
Yeah, no, come on. Um... Let's... let's go back.

350
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,267
我的食物可能已经冰凉了。
Now, that my food is probably ice cold.

351
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,735
你想吃我的莫妮卡·布朗饼干吗?
You want a piece of my Monica Brown cookie?

352
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,871
——布鲁克。——对不起。
- Brooke. - Sorry.

353
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,139
我恨你。
I hate you.

354
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,141
谢谢你,警官。
Thank you, Officer.

355
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,276
很抱歉给你带来麻烦。
I'm so sorry to cause you trouble.

356
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,944
没有问题。祝您愉快，女士。
No problem. Have a nice day, ma'am.

357
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:16,946
你,太。
You, too.

358
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:28,657
-回你的房间去-但是妈妈，我…回你的房间去。
- Get to your room. - But mom, I... Go to your room.

359
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:32,363
在我开口之前，我一个字都不想听你说。
I don't wanna hear another word out of you until I say so.

360
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:49,077
真不敢相信我沦落到只剩下一对廉价的鸡翅了。
I can't believe I'm reduced to a pair of cheap store-bought wings.

361
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,546
你觉得这些太小了吗?
You think these are too small?

362
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,780
你想要多大的?
How big do you want 'em?

363
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,883
你整晚都要打翻别人的饮料什么的。
You're gonna be knocking over people's drinks and shit all night.

364
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,352
我觉得它们很可爱。
I think they're cute.

365
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,188
嗯，他们并不可怕。
Well, they're not terrible.

366
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,989
你没有选择的余地。
You don't really have a choice.

367
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,059
呃，是我妈妈。
Ugh, it's my mom.

368
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,095
你跟你妈说我们今晚要去哪?
Where did you tell your mother we were going tonight?

369
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,997
梅根·梅兰妮的万圣节派对。
Megan Melanie's Halloween party.

370
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,934
好的。我在门口等你。
Okay. I'll catch you out front.

371
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,001
好的。
Okay.

372
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,269
嘿,妈妈。
Hey, Mom.

373
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,075
好。
Good.

374
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,011
不，我和西耶娜在城里。
No, I'm just in town with Sienna.

375
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,883
你什么时候回家?因为…对不起。
What time are you gonna be home? Because... Sorry.

376
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,919
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

377
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,188
好了。
Nice.

378
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,728
没什么。我刚碰到一个穿着恐怖小丑服的人。
Nothing. I just ran into a man wearing terrifying clown costume.

379
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,130
我能帮你找点什么吗?
Can I help you find anything?

380
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:51,869
需要帮忙吗?
Need any help?

381
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,352
一切还好吧?
Uh, find everything okay?

382
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,522
是的。嗯。
Yeah. Mmhmm.

383
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,025
我要扫描一下。
I'm gonna need to scan those.

384
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,196
哦。嗯,对的。对不起。
Oh. Um, right. Sorry.

385
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,200
一切都很好。
It's all good.

386
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,507
好的。这是32.25。
Okay. That'll be 32.25.

387
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,042
是的,嗯…
Yeah, um...

388
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,982
我想我把包落在楼下了。
I think I left my bag downstairs.

389
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,381
先生。
Sir.

390
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,620
如果你要把它放进嘴里，就得付钱。
If you're gonna put that in your mouth, you gotta pay for it.

391
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,630
给你。
Here you go.

392
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,666
谢谢。
Thanks.

393
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,639
你知道吗?我去给你拿个大袋子。
You know what? I'm gonna go get you a big bag.

394
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,275
哦,不,不。我…我真的……-我不…我不需要。-不，不，没关系
Oh, no, no. I... I really... - I don't... I don't need it. - No, no, it's fine.

395
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,112
他们就在我后面。
I got 'em right back here.

396
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,613
好的。
Okay.

397
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,375
请不要。
Please don't.

398
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,517
停。请停止!拜托!
Stop. Please stop! Please!

399
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,520
嘿,哥们?
Hey, buddy?

400
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,289
你不想再惹麻烦了吗?
You wanna quit causin' trouble?

401
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,295
——谢谢。——谢谢。
- Thank you. - Thank you.

402
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,799
——万圣节快乐。——你。
- Happy Halloween. - You, too.

403
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,763
我们要关门了，伙计。
Yo, we closin' up, man.

404
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,433
我能帮你找点什么吗?
Can I help you find something?

405
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,249
8.99.
8.99.

406
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,065
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious right now?

407
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,603
你到底能不能付钱?
Yo, can you pay for that or not?

408
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,376
先生，你在干什么?
Sir, what are you doing?

409
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,285
好的。先生，你知道吗?我要报警了。
All right. Sir, you know what? I'm gonna call the police.

410
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,266
嘿!你听到我说的了吗?
Hey! Did you hear what I said?

411
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,237
在我揍你之前滚出去。
Get the hell outta here before I fuck you up.

412
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,976
这是他妈的疯了。
That's fucking crazy.

413
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,911
我告诉你是他干的，艾莉。
I'm telling you it was him, Allie.

414
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,981
直到他鼻尖上的小黑点。
Right down to the little black dot on the tip of his nose.

415
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,088
西耶娜，你自己说的。
Sienna, you said it yourself.

416
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,024
我是说，今晚会有成百上千的人渣打扮成那个疯子的样子。
I mean, there are gonna be hundreds of douchebags dressed up as that psycho tonight.

417
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,126
连你哥哥都说要扮成他。
Even your brother was talking about going as him.

418
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,428
我不是说你哥哥是混蛋。
Not that I'm calling your brother a douchebag.

419
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:28,536
这只是个巧合。
It's just a coincidence.

420
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,272
那你怎么解释那场火灾?
Then how do you explain the fire?

421
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,440
我梦见了它，它就发生了。
I dreamt it and it happened.

422
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:42,050
你最近换过药吗?
Did you change medications recently?

423
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,887
耶稣基督。我不是疯了!
Jesus Christ. I'm not crazy!

424
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,324
换气。
Take a breath.

425
00:48:55,065 --> 00:49:02,504
我…我只是想说，你有没有想过合理的解释也许是火灾导致了你的噩梦，而不是相反?
I... I'm just saying, did you ever consider the logical explanation that maybe the fire caused your nightmare, not the other way around?

426
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,506
什么?
What?

427
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,158
我认为火灾是在你睡觉的时候发生的。
I think that the fire started while you were sleeping.

428
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,926
然后就变成了你的噩梦。
And it worked its way into your nightmare.

429
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,062
我是说，你的身体一定感觉到了火焰。
I mean, your body must've felt the flames.

430
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,833
你知道这种事经常发生。
You know shit like that happens all the time.

431
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,401
听着，你到底要不要糖果?
Look, are you getting candy or what?

432
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,006
我是说，什么是…我们在这里做什么?
I mean, what are... What are we doing here?

433
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:41,545
即使是这样，也解释不了火灾的起因。
Even if that is the case, it doesn't explain how the fire started.

434
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,518
来吧,亲爱的。
Come on, honey.

435
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,921
哦,我的。他们关闭。
Oh, my. They're closed.

436
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,889
——哇。——哦。
- Wow. - Oh.

437
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,057
看那个，妈妈。
Look at that, Mom.

438
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,793
是啊，太好了，亲爱的。
Yeah, that's wonderful, honey.

439
00:49:58,795 --> 00:49:59,795
酷。
Cool.

440
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,898
好的。我们走吧。我们走吧。
All right. Let's go. Let's go.

441
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,266
你要一直待在这里。
You're just gonna stay here the whole time.

442
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,268
来吧。
Come on.

443
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:16,544
我们不直接和保险公司联系。
We don't go direct with our insurers.

444
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,580
好吧，让我查查你的邮政编码。
Okay, but let me get your zip code.

445
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,650
我去你那附近找个经纪人。
I'm gonna find a broker in your area.

446
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,601
你在家做什么?
What are you doing home?

447
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,103
他在这里,Sienna
He's here, Sienna.

448
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,471
谁?
Who?

449
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,106
迈尔斯郡的小丑。
The Miles County clown.

450
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,741
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

451
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,676
我今天在学校看到他了。
I saw him today in my school.

452
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,478
和警方拍的照片一样。
Just like in the police photos.

453
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,180
慢下来。
Slow down.

454
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,082
这是他。
It was him.

455
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,844
今晚会发生很糟糕的事。
Something really bad is gonna happen tonight.

456
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,789
那是爸爸的速写本吗?
Is that Daddy's sketchbook?

457
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,590
看这里。
Look here.

458
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,428
你有这个多久了?
How long have you had this?

459
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,262
乔纳森,回答我。
Jonathan, answer me.

460
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,798
你知道我们找这个找了多久了。
You know how long we've been looking for this.

461
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,599
读这篇文章。
Read this.

462
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,335
我今天见到她了。这个女孩。
I saw her today. This exact girl.

463
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,438
只是她看起来不像人类。
Only she didn't look human.

464
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,642
她，以前的嘉年华，和迈尔斯郡的小丑之间有某种联系。
There's some kinda connection between her, the old carnival, and the Miles County clown.

465
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,177
今晚会发生很糟糕的事。
Something really bad's gonna happen tonight.

466
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,212
我知道它。
I know it.

467
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,681
是你放在这里的吗?
Did you put these in here?

468
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:27,683
不。
No.

469
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,521
但是看看这个。
But look at this.

470
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,057
这是他!
It's him!

471
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,126
爸爸画这个吗?
Daddy drew this?

472
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,696
这还不是全部。
That's not all.

473
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,383
如果你也有联系呢?
What if you're connected, too?

474
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,319
什么?
What?

475
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:07,489
乔纳森，你疯了。
Jonathan, you're acting crazy.

476
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,424
你是疯了。好吗?
You're acting crazy. Okay?

477
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,759
他为你创造了这个角色。
He created this character for you.

478
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,661
他临死前把剑给了你。
He gave you that sword right before he died.

479
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,697
他好像早就料到了。
It's like he saw this coming.

480
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,499
爸爸给我画了很多东西。
Daddy drew a lot of things for me.

481
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,200
他给我买了一大堆东西。
He bought me tons of shit.

482
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,202
说真的，你有什么毛病?
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

483
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,438
-你知道你在说什么吗?-这是怎么回事?
- Do you even hear yourself? - What's going on in here?

484
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,706
他给你看这个了吗?
Did he show you this?

485
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,940
她不在乎。
She doesn't care.

486
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,609
她只是生气，因为我可能会被停学。
She's just pissed, 'cause I might get suspended.

487
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,010
暂停。为了什么?
Suspended. For what?

488
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,012
哦，你没告诉她?
Oh, you didn't tell her?

489
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:34,249
你哥哥今早带了只死动物来学校。
Your brother brought a dead animal to school this morning.

490
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,050
——什么?-是的。
- What? - Yeah.

491
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,520
一个死去的动物。你能相信吗?
A dead animal. Can you believe it?

492
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,022
他破坏了大厅。
He vandalized the halls.

493
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,358
他们告诉我的时候，我差点犯心脏病。
I almost had a fucking heart attack when they told me.

494
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,393
这不是我。是小丑。
It wasn't me. It was the clown.

495
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,961
小女孩把它拿了进来。
The little girl brought it in.

496
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:50,465
我不想再听到关于这个该死的小丑的事。
I don't wanna hear another word about this goddamn clown.

497
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:54,402
他来的时候，衬衫和手上都是血。
He was covered in blood on his shirt and his hands when he got here.

498
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,538
你被校长当场抓住了。
The principal literally caught you red-handed.

499
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,906
那是因为他朝我扔过来的。
That's 'cause he threw it at me.

500
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,241
我应该听你的。
I should've listened to you.

501
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:03,611
你跟我说了一遍又一遍关于这孩子的事。
You have been telling me over and over again about this kid.

502
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,747
我周一会给希夫林医生打电话。
I'm calling Dr. Schiffrin on Monday.

503
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,782
我现在要阻止这一切。
I'm putting a stop to this now.

504
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:10,418
把你那该死的碗放进水槽里。
And put your goddamn bowl in the sink.

505
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,588
我再说一遍。
I'm not telling you again.

506
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:14,656
这是他。
It was him.

507
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,992
你得相信我。
You gotta believe me.

508
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,931
乔纳森。
Jonathan.

509
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:27,735
这是……可能只是学校里的几个孩子在胡闹。
It was... It was probably just some kids at school, messing around.

510
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,671
这是一周年纪念。
It's the one-year anniversary.

511
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:35,812
我是说，我已经看到了一些…一个小时前在《阿布拉卡达布拉》里穿同样衣服的混蛋。
I mean, I already saw some... jerk wearing that same costume in Abracadabra an hour ago.

512
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,250
那么这些图画和文章呢?
What about these drawings and these articles then?

513
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,253
我们都知道爸爸发生了什么。
We both know what happened to Daddy.

514
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,556
这一切都不是他的错。
Okay, none of this was his fault.

515
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:53,196
这里所有这些丑陋的东西，都不是真正的他。
And all of these ugly things in here, that's not who he was.

516
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,866
他爱你……非常感谢。
He loved you... very much.

517
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,274
会没事的。
It's gonna be okay.

518
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,446
-今晚待在家里。——乔纳森。
- Stay home tonight. - Jonathan.

519
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,815
请。我乞求你。
Please. I'm begging you.

520
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,551
-不会有事的——好。
- Nothing's gonna happen. - Fine.

521
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,989
今晚有人被杀时，别表现得很惊讶。
Just don't act surprised when a bunch of people get killed tonight.

522
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,039
你有没有……
Have you ever...

523
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,048
我相信他。
I believe him.

524
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,051
关于什么?
About what?

525
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,020
我不认为他破坏了学校。
I don't think he vandalized the school.

526
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,656
现在，你相信他了?
Oh, now, you believe him?

527
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,257
昨天，他还是十二宫杀手。
Yesterday, he was the Zodiac Killer.

528
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,360
是什么改变了?
What's changed?

529
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,266
得到了门。
Get the door.

530
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:12,206
由于最近大肠杆菌爆发，东海岸的餐馆已经召回长叶莴苣。
Restaurants on the East Coast have recalled romaine lettuce due to a recent E. Coli outbreak.

531
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:16,680
至少12人被送往医院，其中2人伤势严重。
At least 12 people have been hospitalized and two are in critical condition.

532
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,781
-嗨。-不给糖就捣蛋!
- Hi. - Trick or treat!

533
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,784
万圣节快乐。
Happy Halloween.

534
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,252
我喜欢你的妆。
Oh, I love your makeup.

535
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,788
哦，全是她自己做的。
Oh, she did it all herself.

536
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,223
哇!伟大的工作。
Wow! Great job.

537
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,291
你说呢?
What do you say?

538
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:31,726
谢谢你！
Thank you.

539
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,027
不客气
You're welcome.

540
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,629
——再见。——再见。
- Bye. - Bye.

541
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,964
你玩不给糖就捣蛋是不是有点老了?
Ah, aren't you a little old to be trick or treating?

542
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,266
等一下。
Wait a minute.

543
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,137
你不是服装店的那个人吗?
Aren't you that guy from the costume shop?

544
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,604
你是谁?
You are?

545
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,476
你在这里做什么?哦。
What are you doing here? Oh.

546
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,846
说真的，你住在这附近吗?
Seriously, do you live around here or something?

547
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,849
嗯。
Hmm.

548
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,485
你真的很奇怪，你知道吗?
You're really weird, you know that?

549
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,154
是的。听着，我明白，伙计。
Yeah. Look, I get it, dude.

550
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,090
整个令人毛骨悚然的默剧噱头。
The whole creepy, silent mime gimmick.

551
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,792
我的意思是，它非常有效。
I mean, it's very effective.

552
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,828
血也是一种很好的触感。
And the blood is a nice touch also.

553
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,165
是的。我不能给你任何东西。
Yeah. I can't give you anything.

554

不,我很抱歉。真的。不…成年人不吃糖果。
No, I'm sorry. Really. No... no candy for grownups.

555
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,204
来吧。
Come on.

556
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,914
消失。
Go away.

557
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,517
说真的，混蛋，去麻烦别人吧。
Seriously, asshole, go bother somebody else.

558
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:07,789
你在跟我开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me right now?

559
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,393
我说了，滚出去。我的意思是它。
I said, get out of here. I mean it.

560
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:15,732
等待。如果我给你糖果，你就会走吗?
Wait. So, if I give you candy, you'll leave?

561
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,402
很好。
Fine.

562
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:24,539
在这里。万圣节快乐。
Here. Happy Halloween.

563

现在停止。我的意思是它。
Stop it now. I mean it.

580

他们来抓你了，芭芭拉。

停止它!你是无知的。
Stop it! You're ignorant.

583

他们来抓你了，芭芭拉。

它是揭示。

阻止它。

01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,395
三个月的工作，你只会说它很有启发性吗?
Three months' worth of work, and all you can say is it's revealing?

Johnny!

592
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:52,106
你知道我在做什么吗?
You know what I was making?

593
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:53,707
那是爸爸的性格。
It's Daddy's character.

594
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:59,580
是的，但在纸上看到和在你女儿身上看到是两回事。
Yes, but seeing it on paper and seeing it on your daughter are two different things.

你看起来像是要去脱衣舞俱乐部。
You look like you're going to a strip club.

Mom, this is how people dress on Halloween these days.

597

Do you have any idea how much work I put into this?

598
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,489
你做得很好。
You did an excellent job.

599
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:13,460
但是万圣节什么时候变成了性的代名词?
But when did Halloween become synonymous with sex?

600
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:14,630
你真是个假正经。
You're such a prude.

601
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,067
好的。这是我的旅程。以后。
Okay. That's my ride. Later.

602
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:21,503
Sienna.

603
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,976
爸爸会喜欢的。
Dad would have loved it.

604
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:29,811
再见。
Bye.

01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,086
艾莉!
Allie!

那碗水还满着呢。

01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,844
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

610
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,486
艾莉?
Allie?

611
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:16,023
艾莉?艾莉,回答我。
Allie? Allie, answer me.

612
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,559
你在哪里?
Where are you?

613
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,027
艾莉?
Allie?

614
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:34,308
哦，不!不,不!不!不!

妈妈。
Mom.

616
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,779
我怎么跟你说的?
What'd I tell you?

617
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,548
我从未怀疑过你。
I never doubted you for a second.

618
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,385
来吧。我们去爽一爽吧。
Come on. Let's go get fucked up.

619
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,019
你们要点什么?
What can I get you guys?

620
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:21,188
请给我伏特加和可乐。
Uh, vodka and coke, please.

621
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,556
你想要什么?
What do you want?

622
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,590
手机关机。你想要什么?
Off your phone. What do you want?

623
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,025
呃，朗姆酒和可乐。好坏参半。
Uh, rum and coke. Mixed.

624
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,796
还有，能给我们来两杯威士忌吗?谢谢你！
Also, can we have two shots of whiskey, please? Thank you.

625
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,932
艾莉给你回短信了吗?
Has Allie texted you back yet?

626
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,767
不。
No.

627
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:34,904
你能查一下吗?
Well, can you check?

628
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,973
负的。
Negative.

629
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,475
你知道这不像她。
You know this isn't like her.

630
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:42,509
它很好。
It's fine.

631
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,912
只是放松。
Just relax.

632
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,616
好好享受这辈子就这一次，好吗?
And have a good time for once in your life, okay?

633
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,289
也许我给她妈妈发短信，她会给我回复的。
Maybe if I just text her mom, she will get back to me.

哦，你真是个外行。

我不知道你是怎么喝那玩意的。

649

嗯,追逐它。

你不会想知道的。

01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:48,942
一厢情愿的想法。

01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:50,110
我敢打赌!

从头到脚都是她自己做的。

不。并没有花那么长时间。

你们能别说了吗?
Could you guys please stop?

你让我有点不自在，所以…哦。好吧，喝几杯会有帮助的。
You're making me feel a little self-conscious, so... Oh. Well, a couple of shots will help that.

No. No, no, no. I cannot drink anymore tonight.

如果我搞砸了，我妈会很生气的。
My mom will get so pissed if I get fucked up.

680
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,049
不,她不会!
No, she won't!

681
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,051
你妈妈两小时后就睡着了。
Your mom's gonna be asleep in two hours.

682
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,053
我做不到。
I can't do it.

683
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,821
好的,很好。
Okay, fine.

684
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,091
给我们照张相。
Take a picture of us.

685
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:43,930
好的。
Okay.

686
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,766
哦,让我们跳舞吧!
Ooh, let's dance!

687
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:46,933
好的。
Okay.

688
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,531
-不给糖就捣蛋!-不给糖就捣蛋!
- Trick or treat! - Trick or treat!

689
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,900
孩子们，多酷啊!
Kids, look how cool!

690
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,270
哦我的上帝!
Oh my God!

691
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:24,039
太酷了。
So cool.

692
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,876
为什么我的这么黏?
Ew. Why is mine so sticky?

693
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,445
别担心。这只是假血。
Don't worry. It's just fake blood.

694
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,814
把它放进袋子里就行了。
Just put it in the bag.

695
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,284
哦，我喜欢。
Ooh, I like it.

696
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,125
好的，谢谢!
All right, thank you!

697
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,126
——谢谢!——谢谢!
- Thank you! - Thank you!

698
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:48,128
我们走吧。万圣节快乐!
Let's go. Happy Halloween!

699
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,570
——万圣节快乐!——万圣节快乐!
- Happy Halloween! - Happy Halloween!

700
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:13,455
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing in here?

701
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,361
你想看电影吗?
You wanna watch a movie?

702
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:25,465
楼下有很多剩下的糖果。
There is a lot of candy leftover downstairs.

703
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,534
来吧。我允许你熬夜。
Come on. I'll let you stay up late.

704
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,836
消失。
Go away.

705
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,638
乔纳森。
Jonathan.

706
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,308
很抱歉你今晚的计划被毁了。
I am sorry that your plans were ruined tonight.

707
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,144
我真的害怕。
I really am.

708
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:40,714
但你今天在学校做那些事之前就该想到这一点。
But you should've thought about this before you pulled that shit in school today.

709
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,682
我是说，受够了。
I mean, enough's enough.

710
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,217
我说的都是实话。
I told you the truth.

711
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,520
-我不会再这么做了。-不是我!
- I'm not doing this again. - It wasn't me!

712
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:50,390
如果不是你，那我真心道歉。
Well, if it wasn't you, then I sincerely apologize.

713
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,161
但我再也不相信你了。
But I just don't believe you anymore.

714
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,731
这是什么?
What about this?

715
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,967
又是这本该死的书!
Again with this fucking book!

716
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,203
爸爸为什么要收集这些新闻文章?
Why was Daddy collecting these news articles?

717
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,972
"嘉年华发现被害女孩"这吗?
"Slain girl found at carnival." And this?

718
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:08,408
看看这些图画!
Look at these drawings!

719
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,943
这可不像爸爸!
This isn't like Daddy!

720
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:13,146
他生病了。
He was sick.

721
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:16,249
你为什么不明白?
Why can't you understand?

722
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:19,319
他不知道自己是谁，也不知道自己在做什么。
He didn't know who he was, or what he was doing half the time.

723
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,021
这。
And this.

724
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:24,324
这他妈只是个提醒。
This bullshit is nothing but a fucking reminder.

725
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,326
不!
No!

726
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,997
我要这东西从我家里滚出去。
I want this out of my house.

727
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,777
你真是个贱人!
You're such a bitch!

728
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:47,015
不准你再对我说这种话!
Don't you ever say that to me again!

729
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:52,052
乔纳森。乔纳森，你给我回来
Jonathan. Jonathan, you get back here.

730
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:53,255
乔纳森!
Jonathan!

731
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:20,280
我马上回来。
I'll be right back.

732
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:22,616
等待。你要去哪里?
Wait. Where are you going?

733
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:23,919
我去喝一杯。
I'm gonna grab a drink.

734
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:05,127
-能给我张自拍吗?——确定。
- Yo, can I get a selfie? - Sure.

735
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:08,964
他妈的,是的,女孩!
Fuck, yeah, girl!

736
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,697
什么?
What?

737
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,236
什么?
What?

738
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,778
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

739
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:39,119
Sienna!

740
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,054
——嘿!——你好!
- Hey! - Hi!

741
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,457
我想你了，姑娘。
I missed you, girl.

742
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:46,793
嗨。
Hi.

743
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,095
不,等等。
No, wait.

744
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,864
——觉得这。——哦。
- Feel this. - Oh.

745
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,465
哦。
Oh.

746
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:56,736
-我的天啊。——不,不。等待。
- Oh, my God. - No, no. Wait.

747
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,372
你不明白。我想要它。
You don't understand. I want it.

748
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:02,610
——我知道。-我想…生活在其中，你知道吗?
- I know. - I wanna like... live in it, you know?

749
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,948
-你感觉怎么样?——好。
- How are you feeling? - Good.

750
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,283
是吗?
Yeah?

751
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,652
-实际上非常好!——好的。
- So good actually! - Okay.

752
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:16,056
我觉得……这一枪真的开始击中我了。
I feel like... that shot's really starting to hit me.

753
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,625
威士忌会让你变成这样的。
Well, whiskey will do that to you.

754
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:20,326
-我需要这个。-是的。
- I needed this. - Yeah.

755
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:21,594
你是对的。
You were right.

756
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,129
-你说得太对了-是的。
- You were so right. - Yeah.

757
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:31,673
我需要出去走走，不再去想，不再去担心生活中的每一件小事。
I needed to just, like get out, and stop thinking, worrying about every little thing in my life.

758
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,175
喜欢……这样的服装。
Like... like this costume.

759
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,509
是的。
Yeah.

760
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,178
我是说，这应该是件快乐的事。
I mean, it should be a happy thing.

761
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,581
-是的。——你知道吗?
- Yeah. - You know?

762
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,285
这让我想起了我爸爸。
It reminds me of my Dad.

763
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:50,623
他过去……当我还是个小女孩的时候，他经常给我画这个角色。
He used to... He used to draw this character for me when I was a little girl.

764
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:54,427
他曾告诉我，我长大后会像她一样。
He used to tell me I was gonna grow up to be like her one day.

765
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,362
我真的相信了。
And I really believed it.

766
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:57,330
看看你现在的样子!
Well, look at you now!

767
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:58,531
你是她的。
You are her.

768
01:18:58,533 --> 01:18:59,999
我一点也不像她。
I am nothing like her.

769
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,034
我不勇敢。
I'm not courageous.

770
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,235
我不勇敢。
I'm not brave.

771
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:06,372
我今天真的在学校里恐慌症发作了当着大家的面。
I mean, I literally had a panic attack today in school in front of everybody.

772
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:10,543
我在你的饮料里放了莫利。
I put molly in your drink.

773
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:13,313
什么?
What?

774
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:16,516
我做到了。我在你的酒里放了半片，我的酒里放了半片。
I did. I put a half a tablet in your drink, the other half in mine.

775
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:18,118
也不是真的，没什么大不了的。
Not even really, it was kind of nothing.

776
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,786
但没关系，因为我也在上面。
But it's fine, 'cause I'm also on it.

777
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,454
所以，我们完全没问题。你和我。
So, we're totally fine. You and me.

778
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:25,024
所以你才会觉得自己磕了摇头丸。
And that is why you feel like you're on molly.

779
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:27,494
因为你。
'Cause you are.

780
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:28,728
现在。
Right now.

781
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,363
你他妈的婊子!
You fuckin' bitch!

782
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:34,167
什么……-太糟糕了!-我做到了。
What the... - That is so messed up! - I did it.

783
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:35,401
我让你感觉好点了，不是吗?
I made you feel better, didn't I?

784
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,470
我他妈的很生气。
I'm fucking pissed.

785
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:38,705
不，别生气。
No, don't be pissed.

786
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:39,973
你微笑。你不能生气。
You're smiling. You can't be pissed.

787
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,474
不,婊子。我不微笑。
No, bitch. I'm not smiling.

788
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:42,842
你完全微笑。
You're totally smiling.

789
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,748
所以，我们要回去，我们要跳舞。
So, we gotta go back out, and we gotta dance.

790
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,209
乔纳森。
Jonathan.

791
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:53,415
乔纳森，请回去。
Jonathan, please get back.

792
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,252
乔纳森!
Jonathan!

793
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,893
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

794
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,761
什么?
What?

795
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:11,431
我妈给我打了六次电话。
My mom called me like six times.

796
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:15,134
——哦。不要给她回电话。-我要去看…-别给她回电话!嘘，嘘，嘘!
- Ooh. Do not call her back. - I'm gonna see... - Don't call her back! - Shh, shh, shh!

797
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,437
Sienna. Sienna.

798
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,638
——Sienna。——嘿!
- Sienna. - Hey!

799
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,241
——停。-他死了，西耶娜!
- Stop it. - He's dead, Sienna!

800
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:23,509
等待。什么?
Wait. What?

801
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:24,777
切断了电话。
Cut the call.

802
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:26,579
等一下,妈妈。妈妈，我听不见。
Wait, mom. Mom, I can't hear you.

803
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:31,351
只是…嗯,抱歉。
Just... Um, sorry.

804
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:34,020
嗯，你说什么?
Um, what'd you say?

805
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:38,024
他把整辆车都涂满了剃须膏!
He covered the entire fucking car with shaving cream!

806
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,092
什么?
What?

807
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,994
是啊!整件该死的事。
Yeah! The whole fucking thing.

808
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,765
剃须膏，厕纸，鸡蛋。他死了!
Shaving cream, toilet paper, eggs. He's dead!

809
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:50,203
他……乔纳森不会这么做的。
He... Jonathan wouldn't do that.

810
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,438
是的。不是他干的。
Yeah. He didn't do this.

811
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,142
就像他今早没有破坏学校一样!
Just like he didn't vandalize the school this morning!

812
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:58,278
看看这个。不，不，不，不，不。
Look at this. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

813
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,347
这个…这太疯狂了。
This... this is crazy now.

814
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:03,316
他马上就去看心理医生。
He's going to that psychiatrist immediately.

815
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,685
我再也受不了他了。
I cannot deal with him anymore.

816
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:06,886
妈妈,真的吗?
Really, mom?

817
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:12,458
你要送他去看心理医生就因为他在你车上抹了一点剃须膏吗?
You're gonna send him to a shrink because what, he put like a little bit of shaving cream on your car?

818
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,494
我很高兴你觉得这很有趣，西耶娜。
I'm glad you think this is funny, Sienna.

819
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:15,828
只是剃须膏而已。
It's just shaving cream.

820
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:19,365
他又没拿棒球棒砸你的挡风玻璃。
It's not like he took a baseball bat to your windshield.

821
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:23,405
这是万圣节。我的意思是……你喝醉了吗?
It's Halloween. I mean... Are you drunk?

822
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,307
——没有。-不，你是。
- No. - Yes, you are.

823
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:31,577
我能从你的声音里听出来。你喝了多少酒?
I can hear it in your voice. How many drinks have you had?

824
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:34,080
我…我以为我们说的是乔纳森。
I... I thought we were talking about Jonathan.

825
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:41,554
西耶娜，帮我个忙，如果你回家时满身是泥——我今晚要处理的事情……——没有。
Sienna, so help me, if you come home plastered on top of everything else - I'm dealing with tonight... - No.

826
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:44,657
我对天发誓，我没醉。我甚至可以做个酒精测试。
I swear to God, I'm not drunk. I'll even take a breathalyzer.

827
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:45,591
我杀死你。
You're killing me.

828
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:46,893
你知道吗?
You know that?

829
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:49,698
你和你哥哥，我受够了。
You and your brother both, I have had it.

830
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,032
我爱你。
I love you.

831
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:57,503
是的，西耶娜，我警告你。
Yeah, Sienna, I am warning you.

832
01:22:57,505 --> 01:22:59,105
不。妈妈,真的。
No. Really, mom.

833
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:01,276
我…我爱你。我…
I... I love you. I...

834
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,612
我说得不够多。
I don't say it enough.

835
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:08,883
我也爱你。
I love you, too.

836
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:15,423
去享受你的聚会吧。我…很抱歉打扰你。
Go and enjoy your party. I'm... I'm sorry to bother you.

837
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:19,058
和听。
And listen.

838
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,561
乔纳森会没事的。
Everything will be okay with Jonathan.

839
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,096
我保证。
I promise.

840
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:26,199
记住我说的话。
Just remember what I said.

841
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:28,468
回家的时候小心点，好吗?
Be careful getting home, all right?

842
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:31,139
我会的。再见。
I will. Bye.

843
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:37,744
娘,万圣节快乐!
Happy Halloween, motherfuckers!

844
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:42,315
-怎么样?——好。
- How'd it go? - Fine.

845
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,583
好吧。
All right.

846
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,885
我来给你讲点莫莉的规矩。
Let me give you a little molly etiquette here.

847
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:53,626
第一条规矩，当你吸了莫利的时候千万别打电话给你妈。
Rule number one, you never ever call your mother when you're rolling on molly.

848
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:56,262
好吧?你的母亲,从来没有。好吧?
Okay? Your mother, never. All right?

849
01:23:56,264 --> 01:24:01,136
第二条，你他妈不能浪费时间。来吧。
Rule number two, you don't fucking let it go to waste. Come on.

850
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:17,517
看看这个。
Look at this.

851
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:21,156
他真的以为自己能逃脱惩罚吗?
Did he really think he was gonna get away with this?

852
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:26,361
他将会猛然醒悟。
He is in for a rude awakening.

853
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,999
事情会改变的。
Things are gonna change.

854
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:54,789
♪痛，总是痛
♪ Pain, always pain ♪

855
01:24:57,225 --> 01:25:02,664
♪痛，总是痛
♪ Pain, always pain ♪

856
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:07,133
♪痛苦造就了节奏，♪造就了节奏
♪ Pain makes the rhythm, makes the rhythm ♪

857
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,534
让节奏变得♬♬
♪ Makes the rhythm ♪

858
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:11,003
♪痛苦，痛苦造就了节奏，痛苦造就了节奏
♪ Pain, pain makes the rhythm, makes the rhythm ♪

859
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,338
让♪节奏，让♪痛苦
♪ Makes the rhythm, pain ♪

860
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,541
你看到了吗?
Do you see that?

861
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:20,348
那里。那个小女孩。
There. There. That little girl.

862
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,816
她在说什么?
What is she saying?

863
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,487
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

864
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:30,356
我…我…我对天发誓。
I... I... I swear to God.

865
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,024
她就在那里。我…我看见她了。
She was right there. I... I saw her.

866
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,459
她…她就在那里。
She was... She was... she was right there.

867
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,428
好的。来吧。这是浴室。
Okay. Come on. It's bathroom time.

868
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,100
Sienna? Sienna?

869
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,336
好的。西耶娜，看着我。没关系。嘘,嘘,嘘。
Okay. Sienna, look at me. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

870
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,839
Sienna,呼吸。呼吸。呼吸。你会没事的。
Sienna, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. You're gonna be okay.

871
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:50,743
Sienna?

872
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:01,923
妈妈!
Mom!

873
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,763
帮帮我!
Help me!

874
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:22,597
很遗憾你不得不离开。
I'm sorry you had to leave.

875
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:24,766
这是没有问题。
It's no problem.

876
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:28,868
你没事吧?
You okay?

877
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,370
西耶娜，刚才是怎么回事?
Sienna, what the fuck was that back there?

878
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:32,238
我很好。
I'm fine.

879
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,572
你他妈开什么玩笑?
Are you fucking kidding me?

880
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,041
不!你不是很好。
No! You're not fine.

881
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:37,777
你现在一点都不好。
You are so completely far from fine right now.

882
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:39,045
你完全被吓坏了。
You're just totally freaked out.

883
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:40,713
哎呀,布鲁克。我想知道为什么。
Gee, Brooke. I wonder why.

884
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:42,648
哦!别怪我。
Oh! Don't blame this on me.

885
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,216
我现在和你处境一样，好吗?
I'm on the same shit as you right now, okay?

886
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:45,584
-我没有害怕。——哇!
- I'm not freaking out. - Whoa!

887
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,020
我们在这里说什么?什么狗屎?
What are we talking about here? What shit?

888
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,922
我在她的饮料里放了一点莫利。
I put a pinch of molly in her drink.

889
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:51,357
没什么。
It was nothing.

890
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:52,792
- +阿普唑仑。——什么?
- Plus Xanax. - What?

891
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,360
我没有给你阿普唑仑。
I did not give you Xanax.

892
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:57,697
不，她已经在吃阿普唑仑了，我不知道，好吗?
No, she was already on Xanax, which I didn't know about, okay?

893
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,031
让我们把话说清楚。
Let's make that perfectly fucking clear.

894
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,900
你差点杀了我。
You could've fucking killed me.

895
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:03,402
我只是想为你做点好事。
I was trying to do something nice for you.

896
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:04,737
耶稣基督!
Jesus Christ!

897
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,541
你一直都像个病态女士。
You're like Ms. Morbid all the time.

898
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:10,409
谢谢。
Thanks.

899
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:11,412
送我回家吧。
Just take me home.

900
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:16,982
西耶娜，刚才发生的事不正常。
Sienna, whatever happened back there was not normal.

901
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:18,284
好吗?
Okay?

902
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:22,054
你可能得了脑动脉瘤，或者癫痫发作之类的。
You could have had like a brain aneurysm, or seizure, or something.

903
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,723
如果再发生这种事怎么办?
What if it happens again?

904
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,057
要送她去急诊室吗?
Wanna take her to the emergency room?

905
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,892
我…我只是…我只想回家。
I... I just... I just wanna go home.

906
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,563
送我回家吧。
Just take me home.

907
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:33,466
如果是你妈妈打来的，别接。
If that's your mother, do not answer it.

908
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,600
你好。
Hello.

909
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:35,501
西耶娜，我有麻烦了。
Sienna, I'm in trouble.

910
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:36,902
哦,你觉得呢?
Oh, you think?

911
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:39,338
妈妈告诉我你对她的车做了什么，你个小混蛋。
Mommy told me what you did to her car, you little asshole.

912
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:40,906
我的意思是,真的吗?
I mean, really?

913
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:41,741
不。我需要你的帮助。
No. I need your help.

914
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:43,244
你得来接我。
You have to come get me.

915
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:46,412
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

916
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:47,680
怎么了?
What's wrong?

917
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:49,148
你在哪里?
Where are you?

918
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,883
我在以前的狂欢节上。
I'm at the old carnival.

919
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:54,253
埃里克和肖恩把我丢在这里了。我独自一人。
Eric and Sean left me here. I'm all alone.

920
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:55,955
你怎么了?
What's wrong with you?

921
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,124
请。我真的害怕。
Please. I'm really scared.

922
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:01,026
我不知道还能怎么办。我不能给妈妈打电话。
I don't know what else to do. I can't call mommy.

923
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,595
好的。嗯,好吧。冷静下来。
Okay. Um, all right. Calm down.

924
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,430
我去接你，好吗?
I'll come get you, okay?

925
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:05,831
快点，我手机快没电了。
Hurry, my phone is dying.

926
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:08,768
好的。在正门等着，好吗?
All right. Just wait by the main entrance, okay?

927
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:14,609
乔纳森吗?乔纳森吗?J……该死。
Jonathan? Jonathan? J... Goddammit.

928
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:17,877
他是胡说。
He's bullshitting you.

929
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,111
不,他不是。
No, he's not.

930
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:20,312
是的,他是。
Yes, he is.

931
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:21,380
这是万圣节。
It's Halloween.

932
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:26,452
你现在是在告诉我你哥哥做这种扭曲的事有失身份吗?来吧。旧的狂欢节。
Are you really telling me right now that it's beneath your brother to do something twisted like this? Come on. The old carnival.

933
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:28,020
不。我…我知道乔纳森在撒谎。好吗?
No. I... I know when Jonathan's lying. Okay?

934
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:29,822
我…我能从他的声音里听出来。
I... I could hear it in his voice.

935
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:31,857
……有点不对劲
Something's... something's wrong.

936
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:35,997
Sienna!像,伙计…离这里只有几英里。
Sienna! Like, dude... It's only a few miles from here.

937
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,336
这太蠢了。
This is so stupid.

938
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:48,874
太好了。好吧。无论什么。我也不在乎
Great. Fine. Whatever. I don't care.

939
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:50,876
今晚也不会更糟了。
It's not like this night can get any worse.

940
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:26,378
他在哪里?
Well, where is he?

941
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:29,381
我叫他在前面等着。
I told him to wait in front.

942
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:32,685
-你哥哥多大了?- 12。
- How old's your brother? - 12.

943
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:35,387
即使是他现在在外面的事实也应该告诉你一些事情。
Even the fact that he's out here right now should be telling you something.

944
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:39,193
几年前不是有个小女孩在这里被杀了吗?
Didn't like a little girl get murdered out here a couple years ago?

945
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:45,764
我去找他。
I'm gonna go look for him.

946
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:47,700
什么?
What?

947
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:49,270
Sienna?回到车里去。
Sienna? Get back in the car.

948
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:52,406
Sienna!

949
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:02,416
她疯了。
She's crazy.

950
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:12,927
乔纳森!
Jonathan!

951
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:18,399
乔纳森!
Jonathan!

952
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:22,001
也许我们应该和她一起去。
Maybe we should go with her.

953
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:26,438
他妈的。我向你保证，她哥哥会把她吓得屁滚尿流。
Fuck that. I guarantee you, her brother's just gonna scare the shit out of her.

954
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,475
自从他父亲自杀后，他就完全变成了一个疯子。
He's turned into a complete psycho ever since his father killed himself.

955
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:30,809
自从什么?
Ever since what?

956
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:32,144
没有玩笑。
No joke.

957
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:38,284
他长了个巨大的脑瘤，我不知道，这让他做了所有该死的事。
He had like this giant brain tumor that I don't know, it just made him do all this fucked-up shit.

958
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,618
他好像看到了一些东西。
And he was like seeing things.

959
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:43,122
到最后他变得很粗暴。
And he got really abusive towards the end.

960
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:45,691
尤其是对Sienna
Especially towards Sienna.

961
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:54,333
然后有一天，他喝了一整瓶杰克威士忌，然后上了车，直接撞到了一个变压器什么的。
And then one day, he drank a whole bottle of Jack, and he got in his car, and he drove straight into one of those transformer things.

962
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:56,669
车着火了，他被困在了残骸里。
And the car caught fire, and he got trapped in the wreck.

963
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,039
他被烧死了
And he burned to death.

964
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:04,677
你在一英里外都能听到他的尖叫。
You could hear him screaming from a mile away.

965
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:09,648
我认识你朋友才几个小时，但这就解释了很多事。
Well, I've only known your friend for a few hours, but that explains a lot.

966
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:11,016
是的。
Yeah.

967
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:14,155
总的来说，我认为她做得很好。
All things considered, I think she's doing pretty well.

968
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:40,980
来，回答我。
Come on, answer me.

969
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:44,049
你在哪里?
Where are you?

970
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,818
我正在到处找。
I'm searching all over the place.

971
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,519
的帮助。
Help.

972
01:33:47,521 --> 01:33:49,488
乔纳森，你能听到我说话吗?
Jonathan, can you hear me?

973
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:54,093
我不能……听。
I can't... Listen.

974
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:56,095
我在旋转木马旁等你，好吗?
I'm gonna wait for you by the merry-go-round, okay?

975
01:33:56,897 --> 01:33:58,497
你听到我说的了吗?
Did you hear what I said?

976
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:00,001
在旋转木马那儿等我。
Meet me at the merry-go-round.

977
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,068
喂?
Hello?

978
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,405
回复我的短信。
Text me back.

979
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,693
那是什么?
What is that?

980
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:36,929
有点提神饮料。
A little pick-me-up.

981
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:39,431
哇,杰夫。好的。
Wow, Jeff. Okay.

982
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,166
别让西耶娜看到。
Don't let Sienna see that shit.

983
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:44,036
我们得在她回来之前搞定。
Well, we'll just have to do it before she comes back.

984
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,137
我不会那么做的。
I'm not doing that.

985
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:46,338
你试过吗?
You ever try it?

986
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,773
是的。一次。我不喜欢它。
Yeah. Once. I didn't like it.

987
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:50,142
哦,当然,不可能的。来吧。
Oh sure, impossible. Come on.

988
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:51,704
这能让我们重回俱乐部。
This will put us right back in the club.

989
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:55,647
他妈的。
Fuck.

990
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:56,649
相信我。
Trust me.

991
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,686
好的。
Okay.

992
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:01,553
好的。他妈的。
All right. Fuck it.

993
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:05,057
嗯…好吧。
Um... okay.

994
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:07,459
啊!
Ugh!

995
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:13,699
这尝起来怪怪的。
That tastes weird.

996
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:29,216
乔纳森吗?
Jonathan?

997
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:52,337
怎么了?
What's wrong?

998
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:53,272
她到底在哪里?
Where the hell is she?

999
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:54,375
谁在乎呢?
Who cares?

1000
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:00,848
等待。
Wait.

1001
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,250
好的。但是，说真的，她什么时候走的?
All right. Look, but, like, seriously, what time did she leave?

1002
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,421
-谁在乎啊?——好的。
- Well, who cares? - Okay.

1003
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:14,426
好的。我马上打给她，好吗?
Okay. I'm gonna call her really fast, okay?

1004
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,397
真的快。
Just really quick.

1005
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,599
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1006
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:22,301
我要去尿尿。
I have to go pee-pee.

1007
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:23,635
你想拿着吗?
You wanna hold it?

1008
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:25,039
走吧
Ew. Leave.

1009
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:34,313
你好。是Sienna
Hi. It's Sienna.

1010
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:37,182
请留言，我会给你回电。
Leave a message, and I'll get back to you.

1011
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:39,618
邮箱满了…难以置信。
The mailbox is full... Unbelievable.

1012
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:40,552
目前无法接受任何消息。
And cannot accept any messages at this time.

1013
01:37:40,554 --> 01:37:45,591
再见……混蛋!
Goodbye... Asshole!

1014
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:46,625
这是两次!
That's twice!

1015
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:49,328
哦，太有趣了。
Oh, it's so funny.

1016
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:51,730
是啊，你太有趣了。
Yeah, you're so funny.

1017
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:52,631
你知道真正有趣的是什么吗?
You know what's actually really funny?

1018
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:53,599
-嗯-嗯
- Mm. - Mm.

1019
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,767
让我看看。哦。
Let me see here. Oh.

1020
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:57,469
哦,嘿。别惹她。
Oh, hey. Don't fuck her up.

1021
01:37:57,471 --> 01:37:58,971
- - - - - -来吧。——哦。
- Come on. - Oh.

1022
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:01,306
-哦，你最好道歉。——我很抱歉。
- Oh, you better say sorry. - I'm sorry.

1023
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:05,077
我不知道你能不能从烟灰缸里吸出这个。
And I don't really know if you can snort this out of an ashtray.

1024
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:06,478
要吸出去有点难。
It'd be kinda hard to snort out of.

1025
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,480
我很抱歉!我很抱歉!我不会再犯了，我保证。
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I won't do it again, I promise.

1026
01:38:08,482 --> 01:38:10,148
你真的很抱歉吗?
Are you actually sorry?

1027
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:12,084
嘿。
Hey.

1028
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,619
好的,很好。
Okay, fine.

1029
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:15,289
但你是个混蛋。
But you're a jerk.

1030
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:51,224
杰夫?
Jeff?

1031
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:54,993
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

1032
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:03,702
不!不,不!
No! No, no!

1033
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:09,308
不!不,不!
No! No, no!

1034
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:20,453
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

1035
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:45,577
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

1036
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:56,888
Sienna!

1037
01:39:58,425 --> 01:39:59,925
哦,上帝!
Oh, God!

1038
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,293
Sienna!

1039
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:06,298
哦,我的上帝!哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1040
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,346
乔纳森!
Jonathan!

1041
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,653
你能听到我说话吗?
Can you hear me?

1042
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:18,437
来人!
Somebody, please!

1043
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:20,640
救命!
Help me!

1044
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:30,951

1045
01:41:36,824 --> 01:41:37,956
救命!
Help!

1046
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,161
布鲁克!
Brooke!

1047
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:35,747
哦,我的上帝!不,请!不!
Oh, my God! No, please! No!

1048
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:57,636
待回来。停。请停止。离我远点!
Stay back. Stop. Please stop. Stay away from me!

1049
01:42:57,638 --> 01:42:59,938
不,谢谢!
Don't, please!

1050
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:04,509
等待,等待。不!请,请停止!不!
Wait, wait. No! Please, please stop! No!

1051
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:08,813
不，不，不，不!阻止它。停。不。拜托!
No, no, no, no! Stop it. Stop. No. Please!

1052
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:14,753
不。待回来。不要……别靠近我。
No. Stay back. Don't... don't come near me.

1053
01:43:14,755 --> 01:43:16,888
请不要。不,不,不!
Please don't. No, no, no!

1054
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:24,656
布鲁克!
Brooke!

1055
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:30,562
布鲁克!
Brooke!

1056
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:44,410
布鲁克。
Brooke.

1057
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:31,191
乔纳森?
Jonathan?

1058
01:45:42,135 --> 01:45:43,136
乔纳森,快跑!
Jonathan, run!

1059
01:49:45,612 --> 01:49:46,612
来吧。
Come on.

1060
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:07,834
这里
This way.

1061
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:14,472
Sienna.

1062
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,310
你受伤了。
You're hurt bad.

1063
01:50:19,312 --> 01:50:22,246
我一切都好。我一切都好。让我……让我看看你。
I'm all right. I'm all right. Let me... let me see you.

1064
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:24,250
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

1065
01:50:25,552 --> 01:50:27,352
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

1066
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:28,753
你是对的。
You were right.

1067
01:50:28,755 --> 01:50:30,390
你说的都对。
You were right about everything.

1068
01:50:32,025 --> 01:50:33,426
我对你的看法也是对的。
I was right about you, too.

1069
01:50:34,427 --> 01:50:36,260
关于什么?
About what?

1070
01:50:36,262 --> 01:50:38,329
他们利用我把你带到这里。
They used me to get you here.

1071
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:40,431
他们需要你在这里是有原因的。
They need you in this place for a reason.

1072
01:50:40,433 --> 01:50:42,233
你在说什么?
What are you saying that?

1073
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:44,235
这是爸爸看到的。
It's what Daddy saw.

1074
01:50:44,237 --> 01:50:48,039
我觉得你是唯一能阻止他的人。
I think you're the only one who can stop him.

1075
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,041
为什么?
Why?

1076
01:50:52,712 --> 01:50:53,747
我不知道。
I don't know.

1077
01:50:56,583 --> 01:50:59,219
我们得想办法出去。
Well, we gotta find a way out of here.

1078
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:05,358
好吧,来吧。
Okay, come on.

1079
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:36,990
在这等着。
Wait here.

1080
01:53:15,255 --> 01:53:17,190
乔纳森。
Jonathan.

1081
01:54:26,926 --> 01:54:28,125
笨蛋!
Sucker!

1082
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:13,704
乔纳森·…
Jonathan...

1083
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:24,110
Sienna!

1084
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:31,082
Sienna,醒醒。

和我呆在一起。留在我身边!请不要走。

1086
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:40,024
Sienna。请不要离开我。
Sienna. Please don't leave me.

1087
01:56:40,026 --> 01:56:44,464
Sienna。宝贝,醒了。
Sienna. Baby, wake up.

1088
01:56:47,567 --> 01:56:48,567
妈妈?
Mom?

1089
01:56:53,539 --> 01:56:55,908
亲爱的,没关系。
Sweetie, it's okay.

1090
01:56:57,343 --> 01:56:58,343
你是安全的。
You're safe.

1091
01:57:01,581 --> 01:57:02,581
妈妈。
Mom.

1092
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:10,957
哦，嘘，嘘，嘘。
Oh, shh, shh, shh.

1093
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:13,726
一切都会没事的。
Everything's gonna be okay.

1094
01:57:16,295 --> 01:57:18,664
我以为再也见不到你了。
I thought I was never gonna see you again.

1095
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:21,266
哦。
Oh.

1096
01:57:26,272 --> 01:57:29,909
约拿单告诉你…不是吗?
Jonathan told you... didn't he?

1097
01:57:33,179 --> 01:57:34,179
什么?
What?

1098
01:57:34,814 --> 01:57:36,180
Sienna!
