00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:48,805
October 11, 1931, Los Angeles.

4
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,511
A conflagration of biblical proportions
incinerates nearly everyone...

5
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,800
...in what was once LA's
most celebrated medical facility:

6
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:02,549
The Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute
For the Criminally Insane.

7
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:06,422
But the secret this inferno burned free
was far more frightening...

8
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:09,337
...than any picture
Hollywood could produce.

9
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:11,794
A sanitarium of slaughter...

10
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:14,917
...supervised by a surgeon gone mad:

11
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:18,624
Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

12
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,955
Doctor Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

13
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,746
Little known today...

14
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:27,828
...but likely the most prolific
mass murderer of this century.

15
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:29,785
He out-butchered Bundy.

16
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,784
He made Manson look meek.

17
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,824
And the site of his carnage
still exists today...

18
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,781
...restored almost to its original state.

19
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,571
But it has yet to be inhabited,
because some say...

20
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:43,820
...the spirits of Vannacutt and his victims...

21
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:48,067
...still live within the walls
of the House on Haunted Hill.

22
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:51,691
No shit.

23
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:55,397
We'll be back with more
Terrifying But True in a moment.

24
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:57,729
No need, baby.

25
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:01,228
You just gave me everything l needed.

26
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:18,635
Price.

27
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,926
Evelyn, how nice.

28
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,132
That is totally fucking fascinating,
but l've got to get back to you.

29
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:28,714
They're trying to shoot me here.

30
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:32,837
What is it, Mr. Price, business or pleasure?

31
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,336
Neither. My wife.

32
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,959
Your roller coaster is quote,
''Unlike any that has come before it.''

33
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,832
Absolutely. No cheap thrills.

34
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,081
A journey to the brink of madness.

35
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:48,412
lt just looks like a generic roller coaster
to me. What's the gimmick?

36
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:51,744
Ever seen one that starts at the top?

37
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,740
Twenty stories worth of top?

38
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:08,694
Sources said the reason
your park's opening has been delayed...

39
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:12,025
...was a near-fatal accident
on one of the rides here.

40
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,815
l wouldn't open this place tomorrow
if every single thing...

41
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,855
...down to the beheaded Beanie Babies,
hadn't tested 100-percent safe.

42
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:23,270
What the hell was that?

43
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:25,602
Growing pains.

44
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:29,558
New steel must bend and stretch a little
before finally settling in.

45
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:36,055
Don't worry. ln 15 years,
Price Amusements hasn't lost a customer.

46
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:39,803
l've designed and built six of these places.
Take my word for it...

47
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,469
...everything's fine.

48
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:56,753
God forbid, if something unexpected
should happen...

49
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,169
...there's always the safety cable.

50
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,417
That does what?

51
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,208
Keeps the cab from just--

52
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:11,079
Do something!

53
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:12,162
Like what?

54
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:14,161
This shouldn't be happening!

55
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,326
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

56
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,699
We're all going to die!

57
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,528
Ifyou survived Terror Incognita...

58
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,736
...please exit the elevator now.

59
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:44,521
From here on, it gets really scary!

60
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:30,998
All right, princess.
Now, what were you babbling?

61
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:42,575
Congratulations. On a scale of 1 to 10
on the perversity meter, you just hit a 73.

62
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:56,527
Why don't we go and celebrate
at some nice, quiet little restaurant?

63
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,941
Houston, l think we've got a problem.

64
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,814
Go stir your cauldron
or something for a sec.

65
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:10,936
Oh, shit!

66
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:14,143
We're going to fall!

67
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,434
Oh, my God!

68
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,099
Oh, my God!

69
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:21,389
Problem where? Looked good to me.

70
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,888
Passenger six, he keeps losing his arm.

71
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:27,803
Disengage the flailing-limb mechanism.
Make him into a screamer.

72
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:33,758
Here, dear, with a suggestion: Forget it.

73
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:40,213
Haunted Hill is exactly where
we're having my party this year.

74
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:44,128
Now, you'll find the guest list
on your desk when you get back.

75
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:50,291
l got your guest list right here, princess.
Shredded.

76
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,282
l'm going to pull out all the stops.

77
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:12,614
Excuse me, the people
from HRS Entertainment are getting antsy.

78
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,571
Tell them l'm right there.

79
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:49,565
Okay! Hi! Stop the car! Get out, please!

80
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,814
Stop the car and get out.

81
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:54,271
Can you stop your car? Stop your car!

82
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:59,518
And get out of the car! Please,
sir or ma'am, whoever's in the car, get out!

83
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,434
Hi! Hello.

84
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:06,681
We must walk the rest of the way
because the driveway's out. Let's go.

85
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:08,181
Quickly.

86
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,805
Even quicker.

87
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:12,095
Did l say quicker? l think l did.

88
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:14,969
l'm sorry. Hi, l'm Watson Pritchett.
l own the house.

89
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,885
So let's move, if we could.

90
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:19,217
So is this dump really haunted?

91
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:23,257
lt's pretty scary.

92
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,547
Let's have a good time.

93
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:27,463
Hold up. l got one question.

94
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:31,377
Why is this Price dude inviting us
to a birthday party?

95
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:32,960
l never even heard of him.

96
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:37,708
Neither had l until he rented the place.
But now l must get you inside, okay?

97
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:40,040
This $1 million each, though....

98
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:42,205
That's for real?

99
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,079
Good question. Don't have a clue.

100
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:46,412
Ask Price.

101
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:49,493
ls there a reason why
we're not moving forward at all?

102
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:53,908
Let me get a light. Then we can all see,
and no one'll trip or anything.

103
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,031
Come on. Come on. Little piece of shit.

104
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,652
There. That's better.

105
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:09,025
The lights are a nice touch, Pritchett.
Subtle.

106
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:11,899
Thanks. Worked hard on it.
Could we move?

107
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,314
Guess we know where the Prices are.

108
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,188
Okay, let's go up further.

109
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:21,322
Goddamn, this place is scary, yo.

110
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,155
Where's the party?

111
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:25,737
Looks like we're it.

112
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,277
Me and y'all three?

113
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:30,776
Let's boogie.

114
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,400
Where's our host, the fabulous Mr. Price?

115
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:37,148
Fuck him.
What in the name of Christ is that?

116
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:46,143
lt must be more
of Price's spook-house bogeyman bullshit.

117
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:47,976
Actually...

118
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:51,349
...that's always been there.
Back when this was an asylum...

119
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:54,806
...Dr. Vannacutt found it inspirational.

120
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:58,054
lt's from the Middle Ages or something.

121
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:00,136
Driving Demons from the Mind.

122
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,635
Kind of scared me as a kid.

123
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:04,093
But...

124
00:17:04,593 --> 00:17:07,966
...doesn't really scare me that much now.

125
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,755
lt's touching.

126
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:16,628
-Are you going to come in?
-No, l'm good.

127
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,460
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price?

128
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,792
Any...

129
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,957
...Price person?

130
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:26,915
l don't think anybody's here, man.

131
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:31,412
So maybe it was ghosts.

132
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:35,202
l knew this whole place
would be pure gold.

133
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,826
lf l can just get something bizarre enough
on tape...

134
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:41,324
...l think l can parlay it
into getting myself some sort of a...

135
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,448
...Wackiest Home Videos gig.

136
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:45,197
You got your own TV show?

137
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,112
Had, sweetie. Past tense.

138
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:52,027
Currently looking for the right angle
to either earn or fuck my way back in.

139
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,692
Looks like someone's trailer park
is showing.

140
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:57,275
l wouldn't worry.
l'm sure by the end of the night...

141
00:17:57,358 --> 00:18:00,481
...we'll be hacked into pieces
by something or...

142
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:05,770
...somebody.

143
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,511
Who the fuck are all of you?

144
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,044
Oh, shit.

145
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,584
l thought you were dead.

146
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,541
Not even fucking close.

147
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:49,498
Get off of me, you pervert.

148
00:18:49,582 --> 00:18:51,581
Congratulations.

149
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,159
l don't think Evelyn's said those words
to anything with testicles.

150
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:02,659
Ever.

151
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,491
Very funny, Steven.

152
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:05,740
Have you?

153
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:10,904
l think you're taking this awfully well
for a woman who was just nearly killed.

154
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:15,735
Well, l guess you'll just have
to try harder next time.

155
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,234
That is, if you can get it up.

156
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,566
Not me, tulip.

157
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:22,232
The house.

158
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,814
l think it's marked you to be the first
to die this evening.

159
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:28,521
lsn't that how the story goes,
Mr. Pritchett?

160
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,645
You could say that. Sure.

161
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:34,393
lsn't that how both your father
and grandfather met their demise?

162
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:41,681
Well, my grandfather did build the place...

163
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,679
...but he actually died in his sleep in Miami.

164
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,678
My father was killed here.

165
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:51,342
But that was during a construction
accident while he was restoring interiors.

166
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:53,550
But l'm fine and...

167
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:56,715
...l'm still alive, and l feel good...

168
00:19:56,881 --> 00:20:00,713
...and l'd love to get paid now.

169
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:05,252
And on that mercenary note,
let the games begin.

170
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:08,875
Call me clairvoyant,
but haven't they already?

171
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:13,373
Finding that out is just one
of tonight's many amusements.

172
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:17,538
Sure is a funky old house, ain't it?

173
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:23,535
Let's have a word, sugarpuss.

174
00:20:24,034 --> 00:20:26,200
l think we ought to have several.

175
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:33,280
This'll take a moment. You'll find food
and booze in the main salon.

176
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:35,154
Knock yourselves out.

177
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:00,933
I gave you a guest list two pages long.
Where the hell are they?

178
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:04,473
Shredded. Sorry.
Decided to whip up one of my own.

179
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,596
A group so hungry for money
they'd be willing to do anything.

180
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,178
l thought you'd be more comfortable
with your peers.

181
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:13,510
How stupid of me not to expect something
this twisted from you.

182
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:16,133
''Congratu-fucking-lations.'' Round one...

183
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,591
...you win.

184
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:20,506
Not quite. See, those people down there...

185
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:22,422
...they're not the ones l invited.

186
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:24,796
-Then who are they?
-You tell me.

187
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,710
l don't know how you managed
to hack into my computer, but...

188
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:29,835
...bravo!

189
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,000
Come on. You think l'd invite
that bunch of social rejects?

190
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,374
Sure know it wasn't me,
and if it wasn't you...

191
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:37,873
...then who the hell did? Ghosts?

192
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,663
Ooh, spooky.

193
00:21:41,204 --> 00:21:45,660
lf you really loved me, you'd find a way
to drop dead in the next three seconds.

194
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:49,658
Finding ways for me to die
is really your deal, isn't it, Evelyn?

195
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:55,614
Let's not forget the O.J. knife
with the not quite retractable blade.

196
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,820
Your ''Jim Jones Kool Aid''
that was exactly that.

197
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,860
Accidents. All accidents
until proven otherwise.

198
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:07,483
l'd be so happy
if that were really true, Evelyn.

199
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:09,732
And positively goddamned delirious...

200
00:22:09,815 --> 00:22:13,438
...if you weren't fucking every living thing
in our area code.

201
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,061
Which part of that fantasy
turns you on the most?

202
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,060
Me with other men, or just the other men?

203
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:24,141
Everything you do gets me hot,
just not in the sexual sense.

204
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:25,765
You're hurting me.

205
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:27,473
l know.

206
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,971
Well, there's the simple country gal
l married.

207
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:36,052
Let's go down and greet your guests.
Show them the real you.

208
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:38,509
Corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.

209
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:41,924
My guests were shredded.
lt's your sick little scene now.

210
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:43,090
Enjoy.

211
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:48,379
l'm going to run scalding water
on the place you just touched me...

212
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:50,545
...and then l'm calling a cab.

213
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:02,580
Mr. Price?

214
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:05,579
l think l've done a great job
of getting your guests here...

215
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:07,661
...and l think l deserve my money now!

216
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,535
Right here, Mr. Pritchett.

217
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:16,948
As well as five other bona fide bank drafts
for $1 million each.

218
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:19,697
Made out to cash.

219
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:24,611
That's what l'm talking about.
And we get paid this money when, sir?

220
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,610
The second the sun hits
tomorrow morning...

221
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:29,317
...assuming you've stayed the entire night.

222
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,065
And you're still alive, of course.

223
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:34,106
What are you talking about?

224
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:38,229
Sorry. Detail l guess l forgot to mention.

225
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:39,853
You die, you lose.

226
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:43,185
Your check gets divvied up
by those still amongst the living.

227
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:47,308
But look at the bright side. lf there's
only one of you still upright at dawn...

228
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:50,431
...you leave here with $5 million
in your pocket.

229
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:51,847
This is crazy.

230
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,013
Yes. But hey....

231
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:56,678
Anybody who's not comfortable
with the rules, you're free to walk.

232
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,677
Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.

233
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,926
l'm ready. l'll walk. Now.

234
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:08,547
All right, Mr. Pritchett,
just let me sign the damn thing.

235
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,295
Just for the record,
what are the rest of your names?

236
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:15,419
Donald W. Blackburn, MD.

237
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:19,792
Melissa Margaret Marr. Celebrity.

238
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,082
Eddie Baker. Pro....

239
00:24:22,665 --> 00:24:24,664
Former pro baseball player.

240
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,453
And you, young lady?

241
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:33,910
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP,
Lathrup lnternational Pictures.

242
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,241
Very good.

243
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,739
Well, l think l can say
with complete honesty...

244
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:44,238
...l've never heard of any of you.

245
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:47,403
Great, then why are we here?

246
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,901
How did you make the guest list?
Throw darts at a phone book?

247
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:54,899
l'm sure the unexplainable
will explain herself before too long.

248
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,148
Jesus Christ.

249
00:24:56,232 --> 00:24:58,647
That's it! Sorry to interrupt here.
Goddamn it!

250
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,562
You give me my goddamn check,
right now!

251
00:25:02,562 --> 00:25:04,727
Because l want it! So you give it!

252
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:07,434
Now!

253
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,558
l'm serious!

254
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:13,265
l'm sorry, Pritchett.

255
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,053
Here you go.

256
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,260
-You'll miss the bash of a lifetime.
-My loss.

257
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:24,926
Even if l give you a million?

258
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:27,924
l wouldn't know what to do with it all.
Thank you.

259
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:42,875
l think l got to go now.

260
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:53,620
lnteresting.

261
00:26:03,198 --> 00:26:04,114
Fuck!

262
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:28,186
Now that's ''enter-fucking-tainment''!

263
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,807
This ain't moving, man.

264
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,680
ls this your idea of a joke?

265
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:46,093
Pritchett's not laughing.

266
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:51,049
Open! Open!
Open, you stupid, asshole bitch!

267
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,674
What's going on?

268
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:54,922
What's going on?

269
00:26:55,422 --> 00:26:56,672
Doctor.

270
00:26:58,004 --> 00:26:59,628
-What happened here?
-Lockdown.

271
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,586
What is that?

272
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,501
A machine from the old asylum.
lt seals everything shut.

273
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:06,833
lt's how they burned to death in '31.
Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch.

274
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,790
lf he was going to die,
they were all going to die.

275
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:13,205
Well, no wonder they're still pissed off.

276
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,077
Let's go to the other room
and l'll take care of your hands.

277
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,284
The only survivors were five
of the sadists on Vannacutt's staff.

278
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,283
Why hasn't that machine been disabled?

279
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:27,115
lt was on my dad's to-do list,
but the house did him first.

280
00:27:27,198 --> 00:27:29,197
You said that was an accident.

281
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:33,320
l lied. The house is alive.
We're all going to die.

282
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,691
Why doesn't one of us call out for help?

283
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:42,898
There aren't any working phones
in the house.

284
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:44,106
l've got my cell phone.

285
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:45,897
That won't do any good.

286
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:49,270
lt's the metal plates.

287
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:51,977
lt's not the plates.

288
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:55,267
lt's the house!
Why is no one listening to me?

289
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:57,891
Did you just turn deaf all of a sudden?

290
00:27:58,016 --> 00:28:02,139
lt's alive! We're not going anywhere!
That's it!

291
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,013
So we're stuck here forever?

292
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:07,886
No, a cleaning crew's supposed to come
at 9:30 in the morning, Jesus!

293
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,885
So we'll just stay here till morning.

294
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:13,050
Yes, l'm sure we'll be mutilated
beyond recognition by then.

295
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:17,923
Why do l feel this is a sick joke to scare us
out of our wits and a lot of money?

296
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,296
You got that right.

297
00:28:21,462 --> 00:28:23,212
Take a bow, you sick fuck.

298
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:26,377
You've outdone yourself tonight.

299
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,292
Scared the shit out of even me.

300
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:31,582
You've had your fun. Open this place up.

301
00:28:32,415 --> 00:28:35,039
Asking the wrong guy.
Wasn't me who closed it.

302
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:39,870
Sure it wasn't. Anybody else here make
a living with thrills and chills for the kids?

303
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:41,536
Don't all raise your hands at once.

304
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,742
You're that Steven Price?
As in Price Amusement Parks?

305
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:46,950
Bravo.

306
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:55,279
This lockdown thing, there's got to be
a main control room in this place, right?

307
00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:57,861
ln the basement,
but you won't want to go there.

308
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,568
No, you don't want to go down there.

309
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:03,525
We will both go down there
and try to put a reverse on this thing.

310
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,773
You're not going to want to go down there.
lt's a maze.

311
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:09,230
Then that leaves you with two options.

312
00:29:09,438 --> 00:29:12,437
Either show me where
and maybe we get out of here...

313
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:15,061
...or it's spend the night, sleep tight.

314
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:22,848
Fine.

315
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:25,222
A word of advice, kitten.

316
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:31,094
God knows what kind of freak-outs
Steven's got set to spring in here.

317
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:34,926
lf l were you,
l'd bring something to protect myself with.

318
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:41,506
Baby, don't you think now's the time
to break out your party favors?

319
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:43,297
What are you talking about?

320
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,920
Same exact setup you used back in '94
for the Son of Sam hunt.

321
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,899
Hilarious. Firearms this time.

322
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:31,897
Jesus Christ.

323
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,646
The clip's been welded shut.

324
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,562
On all of them, probably.

325
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:39,852
So how's a girl to know
if these things are loaded, puff?

326
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:42,350
Only one way l can think of.

327
00:30:52,512 --> 00:30:53,720
No.

328
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,635
l think l'll let the virgin have first crack.

329
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:59,467
-l don't want a goddamn gun!
-l'll take it. Shit.

330
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,132
-Let's just go.
-l'll meet you all down there.

331
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:04,131
And where are we off to, Mr. Price?

332
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:06,630
Checking the wiring
on the animatronic mummies?

333
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:10,086
Just taking a leak if it's okay with you.

334
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:23,913
-Careful.
-l got to say...

335
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:26,537
...coming down here's a really good idea.

336
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:28,452
l know l'm having a great time.

337
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:31,159
Yes, well, you're not helping matters much.

338
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:34,033
Smells fantastic.

339
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:37,823
Ain't you handy to have around.

340
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:52,190
l love how nothing works.

341
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:56,480
Let me get you some light.

342
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,095
These things.

343
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:28,964
l knew l should have kept my ass at home.

344
00:32:57,616 --> 00:33:00,823
-Damn.
-You're pretty handy yourself.

345
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,029
Take us where this thing's at.

346
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:11,151
-Come on, man.
-All right. Thank you. Got it.

347
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,771
Hey, Schecter!

348
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:26,102
Give me a few seconds notice
before you pull a stunt like that.

349
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:27,060
The lockdown thing?

350
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:30,475
-lmpressive! Scared all the right people--
-lt wasn't me.

351
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:32,932
What do you mean?

352
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:36,763
l was just sitting here and it happened.
l had nothing to do with it.

353
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:37,929
Then who did?

354
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:42,011
No idea. Maybe it was just
the thing's time to finally fall apart.

355
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:46,717
Somehow, l don't know how...

356
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:48,591
...she did it.

357
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:56,670
You should really open up this place
to the public, Pritchett.

358
00:33:56,753 --> 00:33:59,710
A spa for people without enough stress
in their lives.

359
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:01,376
That's funny. Sharp.

360
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:04,624
l'm the one who didn't want
to come down here, remember?

361
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:07,623
There haven't been any changes
to this part of the house...

362
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:10,788
...since, l don't know, 1931.

363
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:13,120
ls that a fact, Mr. Pritchett?

364
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:14,078
Sorry.

365
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:16,243
That's a good way
to get your head blown off.

366
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:18,242
l'll recommend it to Evelyn.

367
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,991
What's in there?

368
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:25,364
Someone went to a lot of trouble
trying to seal that up.

369
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,696
l don't know. l've never been in there.

370
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:29,528
But it's not the way out.

371
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:34,609
Let's go down here and take a right.

372
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:20,420
This is electroshock therapy.

373
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,835
There's several of these rooms
hooked together.

374
00:35:23,918 --> 00:35:27,416
Dr. Vannacutt liked to zap his patients
in multiples of 18.

375
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,582
More energy efficient, l guess.

376
00:35:29,748 --> 00:35:31,581
lsn't that pleasant.

377
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:37,994
How about we go?

378
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:39,202
Great.

379
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:06,563
Oh, shit.

380
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:12,144
Guess we should have made a left.

381
00:36:12,227 --> 00:36:14,018
What is this?

382
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:17,516
This is the saturation chamber.

383
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:19,765
What's a saturation chamber?

384
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:22,555
lt's Vannacutt's treatment
for schizophrenia.

385
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,637
What would drive a sane man mad
would drive a mad man sane.

386
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,344
Something like that.
l don't know. Whatever.

387
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:32,675
lt's supposed to bombard them
with images and weird noises...

388
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,882
...and scare them back to normal.

389
00:36:36,215 --> 00:36:37,548
Lot of fun.

390
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:39,130
Did it work?

391
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:40,921
l don't know.

392
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:42,545
Did it work?

393
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:45,544
Oh, fuck.

394
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:47,210
Guys?

395
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:03,868
l do not want to be lost down here.

396
00:37:31,313 --> 00:37:33,187
This is not cool.

397
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,018
Let me try something.

398
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:40,808
Can you get me up?

399
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,348
Here, watch out.

400
00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:51,511
Hey, pal...

401
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:54,010
...that wasn't code for....

402
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:55,509
For what?

403
00:37:58,049 --> 00:37:59,673
Could you just shine the light here?

404
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,048
Absolutely.

405
00:38:03,963 --> 00:38:05,462
All right.

406
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:07,211
What are you looking for?

407
00:38:07,295 --> 00:38:10,626
This whole place can't be wired
to just one circuit.

408
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,164
Careful.

409
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:25,785
Better than nothing.

410
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:26,868
Not bad.

411
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:28,659
Down, big guy.

412
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:37,654
Thanks.

413
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:40,361
That was the most fun l've had all day.

414
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,277
You need to get out more.

415
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:52,980
So who are you...

416
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:54,604
...really?

417
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,978
What? You mean like deep down inside?

418
00:38:58,144 --> 00:39:02,100
We can start with the name
you were given at birth, take it from there.

419
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:05,266
l told you already.
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP--

420
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:07,806
You're lying. And l don't think so.

421
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:08,889
Why not?

422
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,887
l've never met an executive
who could tie their shoes...

423
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:14,469
...much less rewire an entire building.

424
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:16,885
-Well, there's always exceptions.
-No.

425
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:18,217
What's the truth?

426
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:22,257
The truth is, if we keep taking rights,
we'll end up where we started.

427
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:28,754
We'll be out of here in a while and go
our separate ways a $1 million richer.

428
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:31,711
So what does it matter
who l am or who l'm not?

429
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:35,959
Okay, so let's say, hypothetically,
l'm not exactly who l said l was.

430
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:38,041
So you're right, you're a genius.

431
00:39:38,124 --> 00:39:41,581
l don't know anyone that could've seen
through me like that.

432
00:39:44,746 --> 00:39:45,745
Look...

433
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:48,327
...my real name is Sara,
and l'm an assistant.

434
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:53,117
Was, anyway, to the real Jennifer bitch
that was invited here.

435
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:56,448
And now you know. And l'm begging
that you don't tell anyone...

436
00:39:56,532 --> 00:40:00,571
...because l'm out of a job and could use
even a tenth of that money.

437
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:20,769
You know, if this is your idea of funny,
think again.

438
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,387
ln fact, you're really starting to piss me off.

439
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,426
Eddie, wait!

440
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:26,070
For a second l actually thought
that you were a decent guy.

441
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,901
What is your problem?

442
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,888
Okay, you win.

443
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,761
You've successfully creeped me out.

444
00:42:28,872 --> 00:42:30,455
What are you doing?

445
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:57,441
Come on!

446
00:42:57,524 --> 00:42:59,024
Take my hand!

447
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:11,642
What the hell are you doing?

448
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:40,170
Well, lookie.
Looks like the games have begun.

449
00:43:40,336 --> 00:43:42,627
-Where's Price?
-What happened to you?

450
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:44,085
Are you all right?

451
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:47,541
No, l am so fucking far
from all right it's not even funny.

452
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:52,289
Someone or something just tried
to drown me in a tank of blood.

453
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,287
Let me give you a hint.

454
00:43:55,495 --> 00:43:57,078
His initials are S.P.

455
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:00,326
All right. S.P.

456
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,659
As in ''sorry, petunia.''

457
00:44:02,825 --> 00:44:05,907
l was with Pritchett,
looking for the master control.

458
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:09,030
lt doesn't seem to exist.

459
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:10,655
Look at this.

460
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:12,945
What is this?

461
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:16,027
That? What just happened to you?
That's nothing.

462
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,192
Wait'll somebody lets out the darkness
in this place.

463
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:22,815
That's a whole new bunch of crazy shit.
You'll hate that shit.

464
00:44:22,982 --> 00:44:24,606
What is this darkness?

465
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:26,813
lt! The thing! The evil!

466
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:29,978
The thing that's the rotten core
at the bottom of this place!

467
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:34,060
The thing that's going to kill us all!
Death by corrosion. That thing!

468
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:41,139
-Are you under the care of a physician?
-No, l'm not.

469
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,638
Well...

470
00:44:44,304 --> 00:44:47,386
...either we spend the night
and collect our money...

471
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:50,218
...or we try to find a way out of here.

472
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:53,092
Either way,
l think we should all stick together.

473
00:44:53,175 --> 00:44:56,798
But maybe that's not going to fit in
with your plans, baby.

474
00:44:57,756 --> 00:45:00,130
You know me. The more, the merrier.

475
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:04,711
l guess somebody better go find
the old game-show hostess.

476
00:45:04,794 --> 00:45:06,127
Where is she?

477
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:26,242
This is great.

478
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:24,807
l guess Melissa found
what she was looking for.

479
00:47:34,428 --> 00:47:36,427
Jesus. She's dead.

480
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:39,508
She was cute too.

481
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:42,882
God, l'd love to get laid before l died.

482
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,963
How you doing tonight?

483
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,460
Yes, l'm all right.

484
00:47:58,457 --> 00:47:59,957
ls she all right?

485
00:48:00,873 --> 00:48:02,289
l don't know.

486
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:15,657
What the hell is this?

487
00:48:22,487 --> 00:48:24,611
lt seems to just stop here.

488
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,859
Shit, she's got to be somewhere...

489
00:48:27,943 --> 00:48:31,857
...because she couldn't have
just disappeared into thin air.

490
00:48:34,106 --> 00:48:35,106
Not air.

491
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,140
lnto the house.

492
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,345
There's got to be a way out of this house.

493
00:48:56,428 --> 00:48:57,928
Some way.

494
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,135
What?

495
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,509
l'm talking to you!

496
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:04,508
-What is your deal? That wasn't nice.
-Easy! Easy!

497
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:08,006
lf everyone's going to scream at
each other, do it in another room.

498
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:09,255
Watch it!

499
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:13,003
l'm about to figure out exactly what,
or who, Melissa was taping.

500
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,961
Then where will we be?

501
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:17,376
Out of scotch, thanks to you, ass!

502
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,416
l think l got something.

503
00:49:54,066 --> 00:49:54,982
Bravo.

504
00:49:58,314 --> 00:50:01,521
l know it's not good manners
to ask the magician how he did it...

505
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,728
...but inquiring minds
are desperate to know.

506
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:06,643
Just what did really happen
to little Miss Marr?

507
00:50:09,808 --> 00:50:11,516
Asking the wrong person.

508
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:15,222
l mean, did she stage it all for you
and then go hide?

509
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:18,637
Or did you just flat out kill the little bitch?

510
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:20,636
l pose you the same question.

511
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,385
Who's next on your list?

512
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:25,800
lf l had one, Evelyn, whom do you think?

513
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:30,173
For God sakes, we all know that
knocking me off is the bottom line here.

514
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,129
You know l'm not going
to make it easy for you.

515
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,585
You think that's going to do the trick,
do you, tulip?

516
00:50:39,668 --> 00:50:41,876
l would never give you a loaded gun.

517
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,374
Jesus!

518
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,539
Funky old house, ain't it?

519
00:50:51,413 --> 00:50:56,368
Friends, your hostess is now going
to retire for what's left of the night.

520
00:50:56,535 --> 00:50:59,533
lf you need me,
l'll be upstairs in the bedroom.

521
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,032
And if anyone so much
as peeks in the keyhole...

522
00:51:03,282 --> 00:51:06,572
...l'm going to empty this thing
into their fucking head.

523
00:51:19,149 --> 00:51:20,856
Come on.

524
00:51:21,356 --> 00:51:23,147
l loaded them with blanks.

525
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:28,810
And even if l were going
to murder my wife...

526
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:33,058
...l don't think l'd do it in a locked house
with quite so many witnesses.

527
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,141
Take this.

528
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:41,512
What good is a million dollars
if you're dead?

529
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,884
Let's find a way to get out of here.

530
00:51:49,342 --> 00:51:51,674
l'm going to try to find Ms. Marr.

531
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:58,504
l'm going to go find me something to drink.

532
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:04,834
How is she pulling this off?

533
00:52:45,356 --> 00:52:46,813
Ms. Marr?

534
00:53:04,096 --> 00:53:06,512
You son of a bitch, l know you're here.

535
00:54:11,562 --> 00:54:13,686
What is happening?

536
00:54:17,185 --> 00:54:18,809
Electroshock!

537
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,593
Oh, Jesus.

538
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:36,217
God, no!

539
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:38,008
Don't touch her!

540
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:39,507
Well, turn it off!

541
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:43,546
For God's sake, somebody do something!

542
00:54:45,046 --> 00:54:47,211
Somebody turn the damn thing off!

543
00:54:51,459 --> 00:54:53,916
Somebody! Do something!

544
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:56,956
Turn it off!

545
00:54:58,456 --> 00:55:01,079
There's got to be a switch or something!

546
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:22,194
l'm sorry.

547
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,151
She's not dead.
We must get her heart pumping again.

548
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:26,483
lt's too late.

549
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:48,181
Baby, l'm so sorry.

550
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,928
l swear to God, it's this house.

551
00:55:54,011 --> 00:55:55,302
Fuck the house!

552
00:55:56,177 --> 00:55:57,634
lt wasn't the house!

553
00:55:57,718 --> 00:56:00,008
lt wasn't goddamn ghosts!

554
00:56:00,216 --> 00:56:03,382
This is, plain and simple,
good old-fashioned homicide.

555
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:10,753
ls it too complicated for you?
Let me spell it out for you then, kids.

556
00:56:10,836 --> 00:56:13,418
A: Evelyn sure as hell didn't kill herself.

557
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:16,084
B: l know l didn't do it.
Which just leaves us with C.

558
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:19,332
One of you motherfuckers
murdered my wife!

559
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,456
You're talking crazy, Price.

560
00:56:22,247 --> 00:56:26,120
Who'll tell me about the strange guy
with the mustache and the lab coat...

561
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:29,285
...who l've been chasing
all over this goddamn house?

562
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:30,701
Vannacutt.

563
00:56:30,868 --> 00:56:31,992
Jesus.

564
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:34,949
Some little shit...

565
00:56:35,032 --> 00:56:38,572
...working for one of you,
hoping to pocket several million bucks.

566
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:40,363
Now l want some answers.

567
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:44,861
Put that away.

568
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,734
Put the gun down, Mr. Price.

569
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:49,067
Back up, honey.

570
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,524
There's a one in four chance it's you.

571
00:56:51,649 --> 00:56:54,523
Put the gun down!

572
00:56:54,856 --> 00:56:56,688
Let's see who blinks first.

573
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:25,174
What do we do with him?

574
00:57:33,337 --> 00:57:35,044
Open this fucking door!

575
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,833
-You sure this thing will hold him?
-lt won't be a problem.

576
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:44,997
Come on.

577
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:49,912
You going to make sure
he doesn't get out?

578
00:57:49,995 --> 00:57:51,577
l'll stay and keep an eye on him.

579
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:53,202
You'll be okay by yourself?

580
00:57:53,285 --> 00:57:54,493
l hope.

581
00:57:58,949 --> 00:58:02,364
l have to tell you,
l'm just a little bit uncomfortable with this.

582
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:03,821
l'm sure you are.

583
00:58:10,485 --> 00:58:12,484
Open the goddamn door!

584
00:58:16,357 --> 00:58:17,814
What?

585
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,979
Open the goddamn door!

586
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:27,476
l can't! l'm sorry, l can't.

587
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,307
What's this?

588
00:58:35,097 --> 00:58:36,472
This!

589
00:58:40,803 --> 00:58:41,886
Anything?

590
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:43,385
Open this fucking door!

591
00:58:43,468 --> 00:58:45,051
How about this?

592
00:58:56,295 --> 00:58:57,295
Better?

593
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:08,456
Great party!

594
00:59:09,538 --> 00:59:10,788
l got to go!

595
00:59:11,163 --> 00:59:12,287
Blackburn!

596
00:59:27,571 --> 00:59:30,445
Wrong way. l think we should
have taken a right back there.

597
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:32,111
Back where?

598
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,151
Damn it. Good point.

599
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:38,274
Let's just try down here.

600
00:59:48,602 --> 00:59:49,935
Yo, Sara, look.

601
00:59:51,809 --> 00:59:53,808
Vannacutt's office.

602
01:01:43,378 --> 01:01:45,877
You've been sick, Mr. Price.

603
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:52,249
And what do you think, Dr. Vannacutt?

604
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:32,574
Look here.

605
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:35,031
What do you got?

606
01:03:35,697 --> 01:03:37,155
Class of 1931.

607
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:39,737
That's a cheery-looking bunch.

608
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,319
Better living through electricity.

609
01:03:46,817 --> 01:03:47,983
l think--

610
01:03:51,314 --> 01:03:53,147
Oh, my God!

611
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:56,437
l know how the guest list was made.

612
01:03:56,687 --> 01:03:58,061
Look at these names.

613
01:03:58,144 --> 01:04:00,060
''Head nurse, Ruthe Ann Stockard.

614
01:04:00,143 --> 01:04:02,142
''Electroshock, Adolphus Jenzen.

615
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:03,392
''Franklin Baker.

616
01:04:03,475 --> 01:04:05,724
''Thomas Steven Price. Jasper Marr.''

617
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:08,556
-They're all here!
-Who? l'm missing something.

618
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:10,555
Everyone that was invited...

619
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:14,553
...is related to one of the staff
that was here when the place burnt.

620
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:17,634
There was five of us.

621
01:04:18,884 --> 01:04:20,883
Five that didn't die.

622
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:22,590
Booga-booga.

623
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:25,880
What are you saying?

624
01:04:25,964 --> 01:04:27,546
Price didn't make the list.

625
01:04:27,629 --> 01:04:28,879
The house did.

626
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,917
Because she's a vengeful, stupid whore!

627
01:04:39,082 --> 01:04:41,373
How's the house going
to send out invitations?

628
01:04:41,456 --> 01:04:43,538
There's a lot of energy in here.

629
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:46,911
lt likes to travel through light beams...

630
01:04:46,995 --> 01:04:48,452
...sound waves...

631
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:50,201
...electricity, whatever.

632
01:04:50,285 --> 01:04:51,493
A phone line?

633
01:04:52,617 --> 01:04:55,199
Sure, now that we're in The Twilight Zone.

634
01:04:55,949 --> 01:04:58,656
lnto an on-line computer?
Through the lnternet?

635
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:01,946
No, stop. Wait. This is crazy.

636
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:04,361
You don't...

637
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:06,652
...get it, do you?

638
01:05:10,608 --> 01:05:13,940
This house is pissed.

639
01:05:14,148 --> 01:05:16,105
lt has no morals.

640
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:20,353
Because it's a fucking house!

641
01:05:20,478 --> 01:05:21,686
This is insane.

642
01:05:21,769 --> 01:05:24,976
-Calm down.
-All right, l'm sorry about that.

643
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,431
Wait.

644
01:05:32,472 --> 01:05:34,971
How come Blackburn's name's not on here?

645
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:04,539
The late Mrs. Steven Price. Tragic.

646
01:06:08,537 --> 01:06:10,078
Tortured.

647
01:06:11,911 --> 01:06:13,368
Lovely.

648
01:06:23,571 --> 01:06:27,236
And suddenly very cooperative Mrs. Price.

649
01:06:40,521 --> 01:06:41,896
Cool.

650
01:06:58,221 --> 01:07:00,220
What do you think you're doing?

651
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,175
Easy. Easy. Lie back. Be still.

652
01:07:06,717 --> 01:07:09,507
Last thing we need is for you
to have a real heart attack.

653
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,547
You're the doctor, kid.

654
01:07:12,339 --> 01:07:14,504
l guess that atropine crap worked.

655
01:07:14,713 --> 01:07:17,003
Yes. Convinced all those
that needed convincing.

656
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:19,877
You are officially one dead lady.

657
01:07:20,043 --> 01:07:22,209
Trust me, l've been dead for years.

658
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:25,207
Speaking of which, what's Steven's status?

659
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,081
Well, he's still alive...

660
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:29,539
...but it's just a question of moments.

661
01:07:29,788 --> 01:07:33,370
And then your miraculous resurrection.

662
01:07:34,411 --> 01:07:37,410
No, Officer, l'm very much alive.

663
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:40,741
Just a little joke to beat my husband
at his own clever game.

664
01:07:40,825 --> 01:07:42,740
l'm sorry, ma'am, your husband's dead.

665
01:07:42,824 --> 01:07:45,780
What do you mean, he's dead?
Oh, no, it's all my fault.

666
01:07:45,864 --> 01:07:48,196
l may as well have killed him myself.

667
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:51,694
No, not at all.
We have all these witnesses that saw....

668
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:54,693
Well, fill in the blank,
whoever it'll be that shoots him.

669
01:07:54,776 --> 01:07:56,525
l don't know. Puff Eddie?

670
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:02,064
This could be a big surprise. l think
the Jenzen girl. She's got the right stuff.

671
01:08:02,689 --> 01:08:06,270
Did you ever find out what happened
to that little TV reporter?

672
01:08:08,186 --> 01:08:09,768
No, we never found her.

673
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,892
So we don't even know
if the bitch is dead or alive.

674
01:08:14,516 --> 01:08:17,973
Price must've killed her.
There's no other explanation.

675
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:22,762
There's plenty! For all we know
Steven's got her spying on us right now!

676
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:24,344
Bullshit.

677
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:26,968
God, this whole fucking thing's
falling apart.

678
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:28,467
lt's not, baby, it's not.

679
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:30,258
Somebody'll pull the trigger.

680
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:32,632
But nobody has yet, Donald.

681
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,423
They're not at the breaking point.

682
01:08:34,506 --> 01:08:36,588
They must believe their lives are in danger!

683
01:08:36,672 --> 01:08:39,670
They have your death at his hands.
How much more do they need?

684
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:41,253
But they didn't see it happen.

685
01:08:41,336 --> 01:08:44,085
They still have their doubts.
They're confused.

686
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:48,166
What we need...

687
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:49,998
...is another body...

688
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,997
...and Steven's bloody hands
right next to it.

689
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:55,787
How the hell are we going to do that?

690
01:08:58,661 --> 01:09:01,409
This may sound a little crazy,
but hear me out.

691
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:53,716
This is all l could find.

692
01:09:59,464 --> 01:10:00,796
This here.

693
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:04,003
Well, it's going to have to do.

694
01:10:05,294 --> 01:10:07,834
Are you coming, or waiting for Blackburn?

695
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:09,917
Blackburn's dead.

696
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,707
Excuse me?

697
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,956
He would've been back by now.

698
01:10:16,122 --> 01:10:17,746
He's dead.

699
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:56,727
Oh, shit.

700
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:08,096
Shit.

701
01:11:13,427 --> 01:11:16,925
-Where is he?
-He's got to still be down here.

702
01:11:17,091 --> 01:11:20,007
-He's dead! We're all going to be dead!
-Stop saying that!

703
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,172
Pritchett, shut the fuck up!

704
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,588
l just wanted to ask you a question.

705
01:11:25,754 --> 01:11:28,502
-Price is behind this.
-How? He's still locked up.

706
01:11:28,586 --> 01:11:30,085
Let's go see.

707
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,874
lt's Blackburn.

708
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:49,117
Oh, my God.

709
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,200
Shit!

710
01:12:04,068 --> 01:12:05,276
You murderer.

711
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,387
Melissa?

712
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:39,009
lt's Sara.

713
01:12:41,674 --> 01:12:42,674
Help me.

714
01:12:44,006 --> 01:12:46,630
-Somebody!
-l'll help you.

715
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:48,879
Just keep talking.

716
01:13:06,037 --> 01:13:07,120
lt's okay.

717
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:19,697
l woke up on the floor.

718
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,404
Blackburn....

719
01:13:24,528 --> 01:13:25,985
Stay the fuck back!

720
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,026
l don't know what happened!

721
01:13:28,692 --> 01:13:29,858
l do.

722
01:13:31,524 --> 01:13:34,689
Please, tell me. Help me.

723
01:13:35,022 --> 01:13:37,188
l don't think so!

724
01:13:37,854 --> 01:13:39,312
You got to help me.

725
01:13:42,227 --> 01:13:44,643
Not even for $1 million, Mr. Price.

726
01:13:49,807 --> 01:13:51,139
Help me.

727
01:13:52,889 --> 01:13:53,888
Help me.

728
01:14:14,961 --> 01:14:16,002
Oh, shit!

729
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:19,667
Grab her gun.

730
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,499
Damn, she emptied it. l got this.

731
01:14:22,665 --> 01:14:24,664
l got this, baby girl. Let go.

732
01:14:24,831 --> 01:14:26,122
There we go.

733
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:29,745
l'll put this right here.

734
01:14:29,828 --> 01:14:31,536
Okay? Look, it's cool.

735
01:14:31,619 --> 01:14:32,869
lt's me. Okay, it's me.

736
01:14:32,952 --> 01:14:33,993
Look.

737
01:14:34,076 --> 01:14:35,076
Poor Mr. Price.

738
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:36,867
Fuck Mr. Price.

739
01:14:37,283 --> 01:14:39,782
Come on, baby girl. l got you.

740
01:14:40,157 --> 01:14:42,739
-Come on, it's cool.
-Let's get the hell out of here.

741
01:14:42,822 --> 01:14:44,155
l got you.

742
01:14:45,321 --> 01:14:48,111
Okay, don't look. Keep going. Up we go.

743
01:14:48,194 --> 01:14:49,860
Up we go, baby girl.

744
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:55,191
Almost there. You just get upstairs.

745
01:14:55,482 --> 01:14:57,773
All right, easy. Don't look.

746
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:29,174
You poor clueless old geek.

747
01:15:29,673 --> 01:15:32,422
All it would've taken
was a simple divorce...

748
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:37,128
...and ripping our prenup to teeny,
itsy-bitsy little pieces.

749
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,292
But no matter how it ended...

750
01:15:43,042 --> 01:15:45,124
...please just know one thing:

751
01:15:46,248 --> 01:15:48,831
From the first moment l set eyes on you...

752
01:15:49,663 --> 01:15:52,662
...l have always, always loved...

753
01:15:53,786 --> 01:15:55,119
...your money.

754
01:15:58,784 --> 01:16:03,781
On the other hand, just the sight of you
has always made me want to puke.

755
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:08,154
ls that a fact, princess?

756
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:12,319
Maybe you could have saved us all
a great deal of time...

757
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:16,025
...not to mention money,
if you just let me in on it years ago.

758
01:16:16,109 --> 01:16:17,400
Help!

759
01:16:19,232 --> 01:16:20,731
You must be kidding!

760
01:16:23,272 --> 01:16:26,145
l'm Steven goddamn Price!

761
01:16:30,893 --> 01:16:33,933
Every place you've gone,
every person you've seen...

762
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:37,515
...every word you and Blackburn
ever said to each other, bugged...

763
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:41,388
...taped, seen and heard
by me as it happened!

764
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:43,928
-Sweetie?
-Anything, angel!

765
01:16:44,095 --> 01:16:45,386
Just speak it!

766
01:16:46,219 --> 01:16:47,926
What are you going to do?

767
01:16:51,258 --> 01:16:54,506
Just what you wanted everyone here
to believe in the first place!

768
01:16:54,589 --> 01:16:58,754
l'm going to murder you, Evelyn,
with the greatest of pleasure!

769
01:16:59,379 --> 01:17:00,461
Witnesses.

770
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,917
They know you're already dead, Evelyn!

771
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:08,582
Happy birthday, baby!

772
01:17:35,236 --> 01:17:36,235
Get up.

773
01:17:37,776 --> 01:17:39,275
Are you doing this?

774
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:40,941
No.

775
01:17:43,482 --> 01:17:44,606
Get up!

776
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,230
Now!

777
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:54,071
Oh, Ms. Marr.

778
01:19:29,179 --> 01:19:31,219
Steven, l want you.

779
01:19:31,553 --> 01:19:33,926
l've always wanted you.

780
01:19:35,051 --> 01:19:36,508
We all do.

781
01:19:39,049 --> 01:19:40,715
They're all here.

782
01:19:41,339 --> 01:19:43,213
Everyone who's died.

783
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:46,503
Everyone who's responsible.

784
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:49,793
lt's your turn.

785
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:54,458
One, two, three.

786
01:20:21,153 --> 01:20:23,318
Open the door!

787
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:26,150
-Somebody open the door!
-Oh, my God.

788
01:20:27,899 --> 01:20:29,024
lt's Price.

789
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:32,605
Open the goddamn door!

790
01:20:34,521 --> 01:20:35,979
Price is dead.

791
01:20:36,437 --> 01:20:38,519
Open the goddamn door!

792
01:20:42,975 --> 01:20:45,765
Open the goddamn door!

793
01:21:10,503 --> 01:21:11,961
Go!

794
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:16,667
Run!

795
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:29,119
Come on!

796
01:21:35,865 --> 01:21:37,490
What was that?

797
01:21:37,656 --> 01:21:39,780
lt can't be! You're dead!

798
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:44,569
Pritchett was right. The house is alive.

799
01:21:50,108 --> 01:21:53,023
There's got to be something.
Pulleys or something.

800
01:21:54,773 --> 01:21:55,897
The attic!

801
01:22:30,088 --> 01:22:31,296

Fuck!

807
01:23:36,722 --> 01:23:39,387
So much for a Ph.D. in engineering.

808
01:23:41,428 --> 01:23:42,885

809

Up here!

811
01:23:45,717 --> 01:23:48,799
Hurry! There is something
of a time issue here.

812
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:04,083
Come on!

813
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:06,207
Where are you going?

814

You have to stay for my show.

815
01:24:09,913 --> 01:24:11,579
Oh, God!

816

There's light! Stay here, l'm going
to go and see if we can get out this way.

817
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:57,973

Help me, Eddie!

820
01:26:09,853 --> 01:26:12,727
The doctor is in.

821
01:26:14,518 --> 01:26:17,641
No one gets out of here alive.

822
01:26:18,724 --> 01:26:21,639
Not me. Not you.

823
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:25,637
Next patient.

824
01:26:25,845 --> 01:26:27,844
Ah, Mr. Baker.

825
01:26:28,094 --> 01:26:31,176
lt's time to take your rightful place
with the others.

826
01:26:31,259 --> 01:26:33,008
l had nothing to do with this!

827
01:26:33,092 --> 01:26:34,799
l was adopted!

828
01:27:06,492 --> 01:27:08,074
Oh, God.

829
01:27:30,938 --> 01:27:32,021

Oh, my God.

832
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:20,538
That was one kick-ass party.

833
01:28:20,746 --> 01:28:25,036
Okay, one more thing:
