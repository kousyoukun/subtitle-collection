1
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,525
October 11, 1931 Los Angeles.

2
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:55,317
A conflagration of biblical proportions
incinerates nearly everyone...

3
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,483
...in what was once LA's
most celebrated medical facility:

4
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:03,442
The Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute
For the Criminally Insane.

5
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:07,442
But the secret this inferno burned free
was far more frightening...

6
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,775
...than any picture
Hollywood could produce.

7
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,733
A sanitarium of slaughter...

8
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:15,442
...supervised by a surgeon gone mad:

9
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,150
Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

10
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:22,483
Doctor Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

11
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,108
Little known today...

12
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:28,358
...but likely the most prolific
mass murderer of this century.

13
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:30,233
He out-butchered Bundy.

14
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,108
He made Manson look meek.

15
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:35,233
And the site of his carnage
still exists today...

16
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,358
...restored almost to its original state.

17
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:42,150
But it has yet to be inhabited1
because some say...

18
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,358
...the spirits of Vannacutt and his victims...

19
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:48,608
...still live within the walls
of the House on Haunted Hill.

20
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:52,275
No shit.

21
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:55,942
We'll be back with more
Terrifying But True in a moment.

22
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,275
No need, baby.

23
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,692
You just gave me everything I needed.

24
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,192
Price.

25
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:21,483
Evelyn, how nice.

26
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,567
That is totally fucking fascinating,
but I've got to get back to you.

27
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,275
They're trying to shoot me here.

28
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,442
What is it, Mr. Price, business or pleasure?

29
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:34,900
Neither. My wife.

30
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:39,525
Your roller coaster is quote,
''Unlike any that has come before it.''

31
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,442
Absolutely. No cheap thrills.

32
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,483
A journey to the brink of madness.

33
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:48,983
It just looks like a generic roller coaster
to me. What's the gimmick?

34
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,192
Ever seen one that starts at the top?

35
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,358
Twenty stories worth of top?

36
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:09,275
Sources said the reason
your park's opening has been delayed...

37
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:12,483
...was a near-fatal accident
on one of the rides here.

38
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,400
I wouldn't open this place tomorrow
if every single thing...

39
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:20,317
...down to the beheaded Beanie Babies,
hadn't tested 100-percent safe.

40
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,775
What the hell was that?

41
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,192
Growing pains.

42
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:29,817
New steel must bend and stretch a little
before finally settling in.

43
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:36,650
Don't worry. In 15 years,
Price Amusements hasn't lost a customer.

44
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,400
I've designed and built six of these places.
Take my word for it...

45
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,067
...everything's fine.

46
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,358
God forbid, if something unexpected
should happen...

47
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,775
...there's always the safety cable.

48
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:02,025
That does what?

49
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,817
Keeps the cab from just--

50
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,942
Do something!

51
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:12,900
Like what?

52
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:14,650
This shouldn't be happening!

53
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,942
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

54
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,317
We're all going to die!

55
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,150
If you survived Terror Incognita...

56
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:32,358
...please exit the elevator now.

57
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:45,192
From here on, it gets really scary!

58
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,567
AII right, princess.
Now, what were you babbling?

59
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:42,983
Congratulations. On a scale of 1 to 10
on the perversity meter, you just hit a 73.

60
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:57,192
Why don't we go and celebrate
at some nice, quiet little restaurant?

61
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,608
Houston, I think we've got a problem.

62
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:05,400
Go stir your cauldron
or something for a sec.

63
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:11,608
Oh, shit!

64
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:14,817
We're going to fall!

65
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:16,108
Oh, my God!

66
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,775
Oh, my God!

67
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,317
Problem where? Looked good to me.

68
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,608
Passenger six, he keeps Losing his arm.

69
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:28,483
Disengage the flailing-limb mechanism.
Make him into a screamer.

70
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,358
Here, dear, with a suggestion: Forget it.

71
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:40,942
Haunted Hill is exactly where
we're having my party this year.

72
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:44,817
Now, you'll find the guest list
on your desk when you get back.

73
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:50,983
I got your guest list right here, princess.
Shredded.

74
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,983
I'm going to pull out all the stops.

75
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,317
Excuse me, the people
from HRS Entertainment are getting antsy.

76
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,150
Tell them I'm right there.

77
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,317
Okay! Hi! Stop the car! Get out, please!

78
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,567
Stop the car and get out.

79
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:55,025
Can you stop your car? Stop your car!

80
00:13:55,108 --> 00:14:00,275
And get out of the car! Please,
sir or ma'am, whoever's in the car, get out!

81
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:03,192
Hi! Hello.

82
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,317
We must walk the rest of the way
because the driveway's out. Let's go.

83
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:08,942
Quickly.

84
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,608
Even quicker.

85
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,858
Did I say quicker? I think I did.

86
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:15,775
I'm sorry. Hi, I'm Watson Pritchett.
I own the house.

87
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:17,483
So let's move, if we could.

88
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,983
So is this dump really haunted?

89
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,025
It's pretty scary.

90
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,317
Let's have a good time.

91
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,275
Hold up. I got one question.

92
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:32,150
Why is this Price dude inviting us
to a birthday party?

93
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:33,733
I never even heard of him.

94
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:38,483
Neither had I until he rented the place.
But now I must get you inside, okay?

95
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,817
This $1 million each, though....

96
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,025
That's for real?

97
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,858
Good question. Don't have a clue.

98
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,192
Ask Price.

99
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:50,192
Is there a reason why
we're not moving forward at all?

100
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:54,692
Let me get a light. Then we can all see,
and no one'll trip or anything.

101
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,650
Come on. Come on. Little piece of shit.

102
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,442
There. That's better.

103
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:09,817
The lights are a nice touch, Pritchett.
Subtle.

104
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:12,692
Thanks. Worked hard on it.
Could we move?

105
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:15,108
Guess we know where the Prices are.

106
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:17,983
Okay, let's go up further.

107
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:22,150
Goddamn, this place is scary, yo.

108
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:23,983
Where's the party?

109
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,567
Looks like we're it.

110
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,108
Me and y'all three?

111
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:31,650
Let's boogie.

112
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,150
Where's our host, the fabulous Mr. Price?

113
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:38,025
Fuck him.
What in the name of Christ is that?

114
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,025
It must be more
of Price's spook-house bogeyman bullshit.

115
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:48,858
Actually...

116
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:52,192
...that's always been there.
Back when this was an asylum...

117
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:55,650
...Dr. Vannacutt found it inspirational.

118
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:58,900
It's from the Middle Ages or something.

119
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,983
Driving Demons from the Mind.

120
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:03,483
Kind of scared me as a kid.

121
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,108
But...

122
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,817
...doesn't really scare me that much now.

123
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:14,608
It's touching.

124
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:17,358
-Are you going to come in?
-No, I'm good.

125
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:21,317
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price?

126
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:23,817
Any...

127
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,150
...Price person?

128
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:27,983
I don't think anybody's here.

129
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,275
So maybe it was ghosts.

130
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:36,067
I knew this whole place
would be pure gold.

131
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,692
If I can just get something bizarre enough
on tape...

132
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:42,192
...I think I can parlay it
into getting myself some sort of a...

133
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:44,317
...Wackiest Home Videos gig.

134
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,067
You got your own TV show?

135
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,983
Had, sweetie. Past tense.

136
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:52,900
Currently looking for the right angle
to either earn or fuck my way back in.

137
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,567
Looks like someone's trailer park
is showing.

138
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,025
I wouldn't worry.
I'm sure by the end of the night...

139
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:01,650
...we'll be hacked into pieces
by something or...

140
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:06,858
...somebody.

141
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,358
Who the fuck are all of you?

142
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:42,942
Oh, shit.

143
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,525
I thought you were dead.

144
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,400
Not even fucking close.

145
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:50,442
Get off of me, you pervert.

146
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:52,317
Congratulations.

147
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:01,858
I don't think Evelyn's said those words
to anything with testicles.

148
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,567
Ever.

149
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,400
Very funny, Steven.

150
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:06,650
Have you?

151
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:11,817
I think you're taking this awfully well
for a woman who was just nearly killed.

152
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:16,650
Well, I guess you’ll just have
to try harder next time.

153
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:19,150
That is, if you can get it up.

154
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:21,483
Not me, tulip.

155
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:23,150
The house.

156
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:26,650
I think it's marked you to be the first
to die this evening.

157
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:29,442
Isn't that how the story goes,
Mr. Pritchett?

158
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,608
You could say that. Sure.

159
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:35,233
Isn't that how both your father
and grandfather met their demise?

160
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:42,608
Well, my grandfather did build the place...

161
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,608
...but he actually died in his sleep in Miami.

162
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:47,608
My father was killed here.

163
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:52,275
But that was during a construction
accident while he was restoring interiors.

164
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,483
But I'm fine and...

165
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:57,650
...I'm still alive, and I feel good...

166
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:01,692
...and I'd love to get paid now.

167
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:06,192
And on that mercenary note,
let the games begin.

168
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:09,858
Call me clairvoyant,
but haven't they already?

169
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:14,317
Finding that out is just one
of tonight's many amusements.

170
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:18,525
Sure is a funky old house, ain't it?

171
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:24,483
Let's have a word, sugarpuss.

172
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,067
I think we ought to have several.

173
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:33,817
This'll take a moment. You’ll find food
and booze in the main salon.

174
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,275
Knock yourselves out.

175
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:01,858
I gave you a guest list two pages long.
Where the hell are they?

176
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:05,650
Shredded. Sorry.
Decided to whip up one of my own.

177
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,608
A group so hungry for money
they'd be willing to do anything.

178
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:11,067
I thought you'd be more comfortable
with your peers.

179
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,442
How stupid of me not to expect something
this twisted from you.

180
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,025
''Congratu-fucking-lations.'' Round one...

181
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,525
...you win.

182
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,483
Not quite. See, those people down there...

183
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,567
...they're not the ones I invited.

184
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,775
-Then who are they?
-You tell me.

185
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,692
I don't know how you managed
to hack into my computer, but...

186
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:30,817
...bravo!

187
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:33,983
Come on. You think I'd invite
that bunch of social rejects?

188
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,608
Sure know it wasn't me,
and if it wasn't you...

189
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:38,775
...then who the hell did? Ghosts?

190
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,650
Ooh, spooky.

191
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:46,650
If you really loved me, you'd find a way
to drop dead in the next three seconds.

192
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:50,650
Finding ways for me to die
is really your deal, isn't it, Evelyn?

193
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:56,608
Let's not forget the O.J. knife
with the not quite retractable blade.

194
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:00,858
Your ''Jim Jones Kool Aid''
that was exactly that.

195
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:04,858
Accidents. AII accidents
until proven otherwise.

196
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:08,525
I'd be so happy
if that were really true, Evelyn.

197
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:10,733
And positively goddamned delirious...

198
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:14,442
...if you weren't fucking every Living thing
in our area code.

199
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:18,067
Which part of that fantasy
turns you on the most?

200
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:21,067
Me with other men, or just the other men?

201
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:25,192
Everything you do gets me hot,
just not in the sexual sense.

202
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:26,775
You're hurting me.

203
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:28,483
I know.

204
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:32,983
Well, there's the simple country gal
I married.

205
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:37,067
Let's go down and greet your guests.
Show them the real you.

206
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,442
Corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.

207
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,608
My guests were shredded.
It's your sick little scene now.

208
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:43,900
Enjoy.

209
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:49,275
I'm going to run scalding water
on the place you just touched me...

210
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,483
...and then I'm calling a cab.

211
00:23:02,692 --> 00:23:03,650
Mr. Price?

212
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:06,567
I think I've done a great job
of getting your guests here...

213
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,692
...and I think I deserve my money now!

214
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:10,192
Right here, Mr. Pritchett.

215
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:17,983
As well as five other bona fide bank drafts
for $1 million each.

216
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,692
Made out to cash.

217
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,692
That's what I'm talking about.
And we get paid this money when, sir?

218
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:30,317
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning
assuming you've stayed the entire night.

219
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:33,108
And you're still alive, of course.

220
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:35,150
What are you talking about?

221
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:38,942
Sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention.

222
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:40,942
You die, you Lose.

223
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:44,275
Your check gets divvied up
by those still amongst the Living.

224
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:48,358
But look at the bright side. If there's
only one of you still upright at dawn...

225
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:51,483
...you leave here with $5 million
in your pocket.

226
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:52,942
This is crazy.

227
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,108
Yes. But hey....

228
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:57,733
Anybody who's not comfortable
with the rules, you're free to walk.

229
00:23:57,858 --> 00:23:59,983
Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.

230
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:02,025
I'm ready. I'II walk. Now.

231
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:09,608
AII right, Mr. Pritchett,
just let me sign the damn thing.

232
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:13,233
Just for the record,
what are the rest of your names?

233
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,525
Donald W. Blackburn, MD.

234
00:24:17,192 --> 00:24:20,858
Melissa Margaret Marr. Celebrity.

235
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:23,150
Eddie Baker. Pro...

236
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:25,733
...former pro baseball player.

237
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:30,275
And you, young Lady?

238
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:34,983
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP,
Lathrup International Pictures.

239
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:39,317
Very good.

240
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,108
Well, I think I can say
with complete honesty...

241
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,983
...I've never heard of any of you.

242
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:48,817
Great, then why are we here?

243
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,108
How did you make the guest list?
Throw darts at a phone book?

244
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:55,983
I'm sure the unexplainable
will explain herself before too long.

245
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,483
Jesus Christ.

246
00:24:57,525 --> 00:24:59,983
That's it! Sorry to interrupt here.
Goddamn it!

247
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,650
You give me my goddamn check,
right now!

248
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:05,817
Because I want it! So you give it!

249
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:08,358
Now!

250
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,900
I'm serious!

251
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,358
I'm sorry, Pritchett.

252
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,150
Here you go.

253
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:23,817
You're going to miss the bash of a lifetime.

254
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,650
My Loss.

255
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,275
Even if I give you a million?

256
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,983
I wouldn't know what to do with it all.
Thank you.

257
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:43,983
I think I got to go now.

258
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,733
Interesting.

259
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:05,067
Fuck!

260
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:29,317
Now that's ''enter-fucking-tainment''!

261
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,942
This ain't moving, man.

262
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:40,817
Is this your idea of a joke?

263
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,233
Pritchett's not laughing.

264
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:49,650
Open! Open!

265
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,150
Open, you stupid, asshole bitch!

266
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:53,817
What's going on?

267
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,067
What's going on?

268
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:57,817
Doctor.

269
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:00,983
-What happened here?
-Lockdown.

270
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:01,775
What is that?

271
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:04,692
It's a machine from the old asylum.
It seals everything shut.

272
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:07,983
It's how they burned to death in '31 .
Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch.

273
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,525
If he was going to die,
they're all going to die.

274
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:14,150
Well, no wonder they're still pissed off.

275
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:20,275
Let's go to the other room
and I'II take care of your hands.

276
00:27:20,358 --> 00:27:23,858
The only ones that survived were five
of the sadists on Vannacutt's staff.

277
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,650
Why hasn't that machine been disabled?

278
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:28,317
It was on my dad's to-do list,
but the house did him first.

279
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:29,817
You said that was an accident.

280
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:34,317
I Lied. The house is alive.
We're all going to die.

281
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:42,025
Why doesn't one of us call out for help?

282
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:44,067
There aren't any working phones
in the house.

283
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,317
I've got my cell phone.

284
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:46,983
That won't do any good.

285
00:27:48,858 --> 00:27:50,442
It's the metal plates.

286
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:53,192
It's not the plates.

287
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:56,442
It's the house!
Why is no one listening to me?

288
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,025
Did you just turn deaf all of a sudden?

289
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:02,692
It's alive! We're not going anywhere!
That's it!

290
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,525
So we're stuck here forever?

291
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:09,108
No, a cleaning crew's supposed to come
at 9:30 in the morning-- Jesus!

292
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:11,108
So we’ll just stay here till morning.

293
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:14,275
Yes, I'm sure we’ll be mutilated
beyond recognition by then.

294
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:19,108
Why do I feel this is a sick joke to scare us
out of our wits and a lot of money?

295
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:22,483
You got that right.

296
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,400
Take a bow, you sick fuck.

297
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:27,567
You've outdone yourself tonight.

298
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,525
Scared the shit out of even me.

299
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,775
You've had your fun. Open this place up.

300
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:36,233
Asking the wrong guy.
Wasn't me who closed it.

301
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,983
Sure it wasn't. Anybody else here make
a Living with thrills and chills for the kids?

302
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:42,942
Don't all raise your hands at once.

303
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,858
You're that Steven Price?
As in Price Amusement Parks?

304
00:28:46,817 --> 00:28:48,150
Bravo.

305
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:56,483
This lockdown thing, there's got to be
a main control room in this place, right?

306
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:59,108
In the basement,
but you won't want to go down there.

307
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:01,150
No, you don't want to go down there.

308
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:04,608
We will both go down there
and try to put a reverse on this thing.

309
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,858
You're not going to want to go down there.
It's a maze.

310
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:10,442
Then that leaves you with two options.

311
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,650
Either show me where
and maybe we get out of here...

312
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:16,275
...or it's spend the night, sleep tight.

313
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:24,067
Fine.

314
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,442
A word of advice, kitten.

315
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:32,317
God knows what kind of freak-outs
Steven's got set to spring in here.

316
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:36,067
If I were you,
I'd bring something to protect myself with.

317
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:42,650
Baby, don't you think now's the time
to break out your party favors?

318
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:44,525
What are you talking about?

319
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:48,025
Same exact setup you used back in '94
for the Son of Sam hunt.

320
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:30,150
Hilarious. Firearms this time.

321
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:33,150
Jesus Christ.

322
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:35,317
The clip's been welded shut.

323
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:36,942
On all of them, probably.

324
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,067
So how's a girl to know
if these things are loaded, puff?

325
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,608
Only one way I can think of.

326
00:30:53,775 --> 00:30:54,983
No.

327
00:30:55,817 --> 00:30:57,942
I think I'II let the virgin have first crack.

328
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:01,025
-I don't want a goddamn gun!
-I'II take it. Shit.

329
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:03,525
-Let's just go.
-I'II meet you all down there.

330
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:05,442
And where are we off to, Mr. Price?

331
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:07,942
Checking the wiring
on the animatronic mummies?

332
00:31:08,025 --> 00:31:11,358
Just taking a Leak if it's okay with you.

333
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:25,192
-Careful.
-I got to say...

334
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:27,733
...coming down here's a really good idea.

335
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:30,150
I know I'm having a great time.

336
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:32,733
Yes, well, you're not helping matters much.

337
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,317
Smells fantastic.

338
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:39,108
Ain't you handy to have around.

339
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:53,483
I love how nothing works.

340
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:57,692
Let me get you some light.

341
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:18,400
These things.

342
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:30,275
I knew I should have kept my ass at home.

343
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:02,150
-Damn.
-You're pretty handy yourself.

344
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,358
Take us where this thing's at.

345
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:12,483
-Come on, man.
-AII right. Thank you. Got it.

346
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:23,108
Hey, Schecter!

347
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:27,483
Give me a few seconds notice
before you pull a stunt like that.

348
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:28,608
The lockdown thing?

349
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:31,525
-Impressive! Scared all the right people--
-It wasn't me.

350
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:34,317
What do you mean?

351
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:38,150
I was just sitting here and it happened.
I had nothing to do with it.

352
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:39,317
Then who did?

353
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:43,358
No idea. Maybe it was just
the thing's time to finally fall apart.

354
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:48,067
Somehow, I don't know how...

355
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:50,067
...she did it.

356
00:33:54,775 --> 00:33:58,025
You should really open up this place
to the public, Pritchett.

357
00:33:58,108 --> 00:34:01,067
A spa for people without enough stress
in their lives.

358
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,650
That's funny. Sharp.

359
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:05,983
I'm the one who didn't want
to come down here, remember?

360
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:08,817
There haven't been any changes
to this part of the house...

361
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:11,650
...since, I don't know, 1931 .

362
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,525
Is that a fact, Mr. Pritchett?

363
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:15,442
Sorry.

364
00:34:15,525 --> 00:34:17,692
That's a good way
to get your head blown off.

365
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:19,442
I'II recommend it to Evelyn.

366
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:22,358
What's in there?

367
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:26,817
Someone went to a lot of trouble
trying to seal that up.

368
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,192
I don't know. I've never been in there.

369
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,983
But it's not the way out.

370
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:36,025
Let's go down here and take a right.

371
00:35:19,442 --> 00:35:21,817
This is electroshock therapy.

372
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:25,275
There's several of these rooms
hooked together.

373
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,817
Dr. Vannacutt liked to zap his patients
in multiples of 18.

374
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,983
More energy efficient, I guess.

375
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:32,983
Isn't that pleasant.

376
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:39,567
How about we go?

377
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,650
Great.

378
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:07,983
Oh, shit.

379
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,900
Guess we should have made a left.

380
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:15,108
What is this?

381
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:18,275
This is the saturation chamber.

382
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:21,192
What's a saturation chamber?

383
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:23,983
It's Vannacutt's treatment
for schizophrenia.

384
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:27,192
What would drive a sane man mad
would drive a mad man sane.

385
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:29,775
Something like that.
I don't know. Whatever.

386
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,108
It's supposed to bombard them
with images and weird noises...

387
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,275
...and scare them back to normal.

388
00:36:37,692 --> 00:36:38,983
Lot of fun.

389
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:40,567
Did it work?

390
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:42,358
I don't know.

391
00:36:42,442 --> 00:36:43,983
Did it work?

392
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:46,983
Oh, fuck.

393
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,692
Guys?

394
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:05,317
I do not want to be lost down here.

395
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:34,650
This is not cool.

396
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:38,483
Let me try something.

397
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,275
Can you get me up?

398
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:44,817
Here, watch out.

399
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:52,983
Hey, pal...

400
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:55,525
...that wasn't code for....

401
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:56,983
For what?

402
00:37:59,692 --> 00:38:01,483
Could you just shine the light here?

403
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:02,525
Absolutely.

404
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:06,942
AII right.

405
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:09,025
What are you looking for?

406
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:12,108
This whole place can't be wired
to just one circuit.

407
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,650
Careful.

408
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,317
Better than nothing.

409
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Not bad.

410
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:30,150
Down, big guy.

411
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,192
Thanks.

412
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,858
That was the most fun I've had all day.

413
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:44,775
You need to get out more.

414
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:54,483
So who are you...

415
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:56,108
...really?

416
00:38:56,483 --> 00:38:59,483
What? You mean like deep down inside?

417
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:03,608
We can start with the name
you were given at birth, take it from there.

418
00:39:03,817 --> 00:39:06,775
I told you already.
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP--

419
00:39:06,983 --> 00:39:09,358
You're Lying. And I don't think so.

420
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:10,442
Why not?

421
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:13,442
I've never met an executive
who could tie their shoes...

422
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:15,983
...much less rewire an entire building.

423
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,608
-Well, there's always exceptions.
-No.

424
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:19,775
What's the truth?

425
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,692
The truth is, if we keep taking rights,
we’ll end up where we started.

426
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:30,275
We’ll be out of here in a while and go
our separate ways a $1 million richer.

427
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,150
So what does it matter
who I am or who I'm not?

428
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:37,483
Okay, so let's say, hypothetically,
I'm not exactly who I said I was.

429
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,650
So you're right, you're a genius.

430
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:42,942
I don't know anyone that could've seen
through me like that.

431
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:47,275
Look...

432
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:49,858
...my real name is Sara,
and I'm an assistant.

433
00:39:49,942 --> 00:39:54,650
Was, anyway, to the real Jennifer bitch
that was invited here.

434
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:57,983
And now you know. And I'm begging
that you don't tell anyone...

435
00:39:58,067 --> 00:40:02,108
...because I'm out of a job and could use
even a tenth of that money.

436
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:22,317
You know, if this is your idea of funny,
think again.

437
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:36,942
In fact, you're really starting to piss me off.

438
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:41,983
Eddie, wait!

439
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:27,650
For a second I actually thought
that you were a decent guy.

440
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:32,525
What is your problem?

441
00:41:57,483 --> 00:41:59,483
Okay, you win.

442
00:42:00,858 --> 00:42:03,358
You've successfully creeped me out.

443
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:32,067
What are you doing?

444
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,067
Come on!

445
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,650
Take my hand!

446
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:13,192
What the hell are you doing?

447
00:43:39,025 --> 00:43:41,817
Well, lookie. Looks like
the games have begun.

448
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:44,275
-Where's Price?
-What happened to you?

449
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:45,775
Are you all right?

450
00:43:45,858 --> 00:43:49,108
No, I am so fucking far
from all right it's not even funny.

451
00:43:49,317 --> 00:43:53,942
Someone or something just tried
to drown me in a tank of blood.

452
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:56,942
Let me give you a hint.

453
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,650
His initials are S.P.

454
00:43:59,775 --> 00:44:01,983
AII right. S.P.

455
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:04,150
As in ''sorry, petunia.''

456
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,150
I was with Pritchett,
looking for the master control.

457
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:10,692
It doesn't seem to exist.

458
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,317
Look at this.

459
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:14,608
What is this?

460
00:44:15,192 --> 00:44:17,900
That? What just happened
to you there? That's nothing.

461
00:44:17,983 --> 00:44:20,817
Wait'll somebody lets out the darkness
in this place.

462
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:24,442
That's a whole new bunch of crazy shit.
You’ll hate that shit.

463
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,275
What is this darkness?

464
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,692
It! The thing! The evil!

465
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:31,692
The thing that's the rotten core
at the bottom of this place!

466
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:35,192
The thing that's going to kill us all!
Death by corrosion. That thing!

467
00:44:38,983 --> 00:44:42,317
-Are you under the care of a physician?
-No, I'm not.

468
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:45,483
Well...

469
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,942
...either we spend the night
and collect our money...

470
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:52,067
...or we try to find a way out of here.

471
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,775
Either way,
I think we should all stick together.

472
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,483
But maybe that's not going to fit in
with your plans, baby.

473
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:01,817
You know me. The more, the merrier.

474
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:06,400
I guess somebody better go find
the old game-show hostess.

475
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:07,817
Where is she?

476
00:45:26,442 --> 00:45:27,942
This is great.

477
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:26,483
I guess Melissa found
what she was looking for.

478
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:38,192
Jesus. She's dead.

479
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:41,275
She was cute too.

480
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,650
God, I'd love to get Laid before I died.

481
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,733
How you doing tonight?

482
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:55,192
Yes, I'm all right.

483
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:01,692
Is she all right?

484
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:04,025
I don't know.

485
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:17,400
What the hell is this?

486
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,358
It seems to just stop here.

487
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,608
Shit, she's got to be somewhere...

488
00:48:29,692 --> 00:48:33,608
...because she couldn't have
just disappeared into thin air.

489
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:36,817
Not air.

490
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:50,900
Into the house.

491
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,108
There's got to be a way out of this house.

492
00:48:58,192 --> 00:48:59,650
Some way.

493
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:01,900
What?

494
00:49:01,983 --> 00:49:03,233
I'm talking to you!

495
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:06,275
-What is your deal? That wasn't nice.
-Easy! Easy!

496
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:09,900
If everyone's going to scream at
each other, do it in another room, please.

497
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,983
Watch it!

498
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:14,442
I'm about to figure out exactly what,
or who, Melissa was taping.

499
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,733
Then where will we be?

500
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:19,108
Out of scotch, thanks to you, ass!

501
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:23,192
I think I got something.

502
00:49:55,817 --> 00:49:56,775
Bravo.

503
00:50:00,108 --> 00:50:03,233
I know it's not good manners
to ask the magician how he did it...

504
00:50:03,317 --> 00:50:05,608
...but inquiring minds
are desperate to know.

505
00:50:05,692 --> 00:50:08,233
Just what did really happen
to little Miss Marr?

506
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,275
Asking the wrong person.

507
00:50:13,692 --> 00:50:16,983
I mean, did she stage it all for you
and then go hide?

508
00:50:17,775 --> 00:50:20,442
Or did you just flat out kill the little bitch?

509
00:50:20,525 --> 00:50:22,442
I pose you the same question.

510
00:50:22,483 --> 00:50:24,192
Who's next on your list?

511
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:27,567
If I had one, Evelyn, whom do you think?

512
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:31,608
For God sakes, we all know that
knocking me off is the bottom line here.

513
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,858
You know I'm not going
to make it easy for you.

514
00:50:38,942 --> 00:50:41,400
You think that's going to do the trick,
do you, tulip?

515
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:43,650
I would never give you a loaded gun.

516
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:46,983
Jesus!

517
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:50,317
Funky old house, ain't it?

518
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:58,150
Friends, your hostess is now going
to retire for what's left of the night.

519
00:50:58,317 --> 00:51:01,317
If you need me,
I'II be upstairs in the bedroom.

520
00:51:01,983 --> 00:51:04,858
And if anyone so much
as peeks in the keyhole...

521
00:51:05,108 --> 00:51:08,275
...I'm going to empty this thing
into their fucking head.

522
00:51:20,942 --> 00:51:22,650
Come on.

523
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,900
I loaded them with blanks.

524
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:30,650
And even if I were going
to murder my wife...

525
00:51:30,733 --> 00:51:34,733
...I don't think I'd do it in a locked house
with quite so many witnesses.

526
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:36,942
Take this.

527
00:51:40,608 --> 00:51:43,233
What good is a million dollars
if you're dead?

528
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:49,733
Let's find a way to get out of here.

529
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,483
I'm going to try to find Ms. Marr.

530
00:51:56,942 --> 00:52:00,317
I'm going to go find me something to drink.

531
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:06,650
How is she pulling this off?

532
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:48,692
Ms. Marr?

533
00:53:05,942 --> 00:53:08,400
You son of a bitch, I know you're here.

534
00:54:13,442 --> 00:54:15,567
What is happening?

535
00:54:19,108 --> 00:54:20,733
Electroshock!

536
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,483
Oh, Jesus.

537
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,108
God, no!

538
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,942
Don't touch her!

539
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:41,442
Well, turn it off!

540
00:54:42,983 --> 00:54:45,442
For God's sake, somebody do something!

541
00:54:46,942 --> 00:54:49,067
Somebody turn the damn thing off!

542
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,817
Somebody! Do something!

543
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:58,775
Turn it off!

544
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,983
There's got to be a switch or something!

545
00:55:23,025 --> 00:55:24,108
I'm sorry.

546
00:55:24,275 --> 00:55:27,067
She's not dead. We must
get her heart pumping again.

547
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,400
It's too Late.

548
00:55:47,608 --> 00:55:50,108
Baby, I'm so sorry.

549
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,900
I swear to God, it's this house.

550
00:55:55,942 --> 00:55:57,233
Fuck the house!

551
00:55:58,108 --> 00:55:59,608
It wasn't the house!

552
00:55:59,692 --> 00:56:01,942
It wasn't goddamn ghosts!

553
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,233
This is, plain and simple,
good old-fashioned homicide.

554
00:56:08,983 --> 00:56:12,733
Was it too complicated for you?
Let me spell it out for you then, kids.

555
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:15,400
A: Evelyn sure as hell didn't kill herself.

556
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:18,233
B: I know I didn't do it.
Which just leaves us with C.

557
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:21,275
One of you motherfuckers
murdered my wife!

558
00:56:21,483 --> 00:56:23,317
You're talking crazy, Price.

559
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:28,108
Who'll tell me about the strange guy
with the mustache and the Lab coat...

560
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,108
...who I've been chasing
all over this goddamn house?

561
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:32,650
Vannacutt.

562
00:56:32,858 --> 00:56:33,942
Jesus.

563
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:36,942
Some little shit...

564
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:40,567
...working for one of you,
hoping to pocket several million bucks.

565
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:42,317
Now I want some answers.

566
00:56:45,483 --> 00:56:46,817
Put that away.

567
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:49,775
Put the gun down, Mr. Price.

568
00:56:50,025 --> 00:56:51,067
Back up, honey.

569
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:53,400
There's a one in four chance it's you.

570
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:56,275
Put the gun down!

571
00:56:56,858 --> 00:56:58,650
Let's see who blinks first.

572
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,150
What do we do with him?

573
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:36,942
Open this fucking door!

574
00:57:39,442 --> 00:57:42,817
-You sure this thing will hold him?
-It won't be a problem.

575
00:57:45,817 --> 00:57:46,983
Come on.

576
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,775
You going to make sure
he doesn't get out?

577
00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:53,567
I'II stay and keep an eye on him.

578
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,192
You’ll be okay by yourself?

579
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:56,483
I hope.

580
00:58:00,942 --> 00:58:04,400
I have to tell you,
I'm just a little bit uncomfortable with this.

581
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:05,817
I'm sure you are.

582
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:14,483
Open the goddamn door!

583
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,817
What?

584
00:58:22,025 --> 00:58:23,983
Open the goddamn door!

585
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:29,483
I can't! I'm sorry, I can't.

586
00:58:34,317 --> 00:58:35,317
What's this?

587
00:58:37,108 --> 00:58:38,150
This!

588
00:58:42,817 --> 00:58:43,858
Anything?

589
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:45,442
Open this fucking door!

590
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:47,067
How about this?

591
00:58:58,317 --> 00:58:59,317
Better?

592
00:59:08,983 --> 00:59:10,483
Great party!

593
00:59:11,608 --> 00:59:12,817
I got to go!

594
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,483
Blackburn!

595
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,525
Wrong way. I think we should
have taken a right back there.

596
00:59:32,775 --> 00:59:34,025
Back where?

597
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:36,233
Damn it. Good point.

598
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,317
Let's just try down here.

599
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,983
Yo, Sara, look.

600
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,900
Vannacutt's office.

601
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:47,983
You've been sick, Mr. Price.

602
01:01:50,317 --> 01:01:54,400
And what do you think, Dr. Vannacutt?

603
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:34,733
Look here.

604
01:03:35,608 --> 01:03:37,233
What do you got?

605
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,317
Class of 1931 .

606
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:41,900
That's a cheery-looking bunch.

607
01:03:41,983 --> 01:03:44,525
Better Living through electricity.

608
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,150
I think--

609
01:03:53,483 --> 01:03:55,317
Oh, my God!

610
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:58,608
I know how the guest list was made.

611
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,275
Look at these names.

612
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:02,275
''Head nurse, Ruthe Ann Stockard.

613
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:04,358
''Electroshock, Adolphus Jenzen.

614
01:04:04,442 --> 01:04:05,567
''Franklin Baker.

615
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,858
''Thomas Steven Price. Jasper Marr.''

616
01:04:08,233 --> 01:04:10,775
-They're all here!
-Who? I'm missing something.

617
01:04:10,858 --> 01:04:12,650
Everyone that was invited...

618
01:04:12,817 --> 01:04:16,567
...is related to one of the staff
that was here when the place burnt.

619
01:04:17,817 --> 01:04:19,817
There was five of us.

620
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:23,067
Five that didn't die.

621
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:24,775
Booga-booga.

622
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,067
What are you saying?

623
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,733
Price didn't make the list.

624
01:04:29,817 --> 01:04:31,067
The house did.

625
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:38,108
Because she's a vengeful, stupid whore!

626
01:04:41,108 --> 01:04:43,400
How's the house going
to send out invitations?

627
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,692
There's a lot of energy in here.

628
01:04:46,608 --> 01:04:49,067
It likes to travel through light beams...

629
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,650
...sound waves...

630
01:04:50,817 --> 01:04:52,400
...electricity, whatever.

631
01:04:52,483 --> 01:04:53,733
A phone line?

632
01:04:54,817 --> 01:04:57,317
Sure, now that we're in The Twilight Zone.

633
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,900
Into an on-line computer?
Through the Internet?

634
01:05:01,108 --> 01:05:04,150
No, stop. Wait. This is crazy.

635
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,608
You don't...

636
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:08,900
...get it, do you?

637
01:05:12,817 --> 01:05:16,150
This house is pissed.

638
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,317
It has no morals.

639
01:05:20,025 --> 01:05:22,567
Because it's a fucking house!

640
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:23,900
This is insane.

641
01:05:23,983 --> 01:05:27,233
-Calm down.
-AII right, I'm sorry about that.

642
01:05:30,942 --> 01:05:32,650
Wait.

643
01:05:34,733 --> 01:05:37,108
How come Blackburn’s name's not on here?

644
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:06,775
The Late Mrs. Steven Price. Tragic.

645
01:06:10,775 --> 01:06:12,317
Tortured.

646
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:15,608
Lovely.

647
01:06:25,817 --> 01:06:29,483
And suddenly very cooperative Mrs. Price.

648
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:44,192
Cool.

649
01:07:00,525 --> 01:07:02,525
What do you think you're doing?

650
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:08,442
Easy. Easy. Lie back. Be still.

651
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,983
Last thing we need is for you
to have a real heart attack.

652
01:07:12,067 --> 01:07:13,817
You're the doctor, kid.

653
01:07:14,608 --> 01:07:16,775
I guess that atropine crap worked.

654
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:19,483
Yes. Convinced all those
that needed convincing.

655
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:22,150
You are officially one dead Lady.

656
01:07:22,317 --> 01:07:24,483
Trust me, I've been dead for years.

657
01:07:24,983 --> 01:07:27,483
Speaking of which, what's Steven's status?

658
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:29,358
Well, he's still alive...

659
01:07:29,442 --> 01:07:31,858
...but it's just a question of moments.

660
01:07:32,108 --> 01:07:35,692
And then your miraculous resurrection.

661
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:39,733
No, Officer, I'm very much alive.

662
01:07:39,942 --> 01:07:43,067
Just a little joke to beat my husband
at his own clever game.

663
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:45,108
I'm sorry, ma'am, your husband's dead.

664
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:47,983
What do you mean, he's dead?
Oh, no, it's all my fault.

665
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:50,483
I may as well have killed him myself.

666
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:54,025
No, not at all.
We have all these witnesses that saw....

667
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:57,067
Well, fill in the blank,
whoever it'll be that shoots him.

668
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,900
I don't know. Puff Eddie?

669
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:04,400
This could be a big surprise. I think
the Jenzen girl. She's got the right stuff.

670
01:08:04,983 --> 01:08:08,442
Did you ever find out what happened
to that little TV reporter?

671
01:08:10,483 --> 01:08:12,108
No, we never found her.

672
01:08:12,192 --> 01:08:15,108
So we don't even know
if the bitch is dead or alive.

673
01:08:17,192 --> 01:08:20,275
Price must've killed her.
There's no other explanation.

674
01:08:20,483 --> 01:08:25,067
There's plenty! For all we know
Steven's got her spying on us right now!

675
01:08:25,483 --> 01:08:26,650
Bullshit.

676
01:08:27,067 --> 01:08:29,317
God, this whole fucking thing's
falling apart.

677
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,817
It's not, baby, it's not.

678
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,567
Somebody'll pull the trigger.

679
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,942
But nobody has yet, Donald.

680
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:36,775
They're not at the breaking point.

681
01:08:36,858 --> 01:08:38,900
They must believe their lives are in danger!

682
01:08:38,983 --> 01:08:41,900
They have your death at his hands.
How much more do they need?

683
01:08:41,942 --> 01:08:43,567
But they didn't see it happen.

684
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:46,358
They still have their doubts.
They're confused.

685
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,483
What we need...

686
01:08:50,692 --> 01:08:52,317
...is another body...

687
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:55,233
...and Steven's bloody hands
right next to it.

688
01:08:55,858 --> 01:08:58,108
How the hell are we going to do that?

689
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:03,692
This may sound a little crazy,
but hear me out.

690
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:56,067
This is all I could find.

691
01:10:01,817 --> 01:10:03,150
This here.

692
01:10:04,275 --> 01:10:06,400
Well, it's going to have to do.

693
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,108
Are you coming, or waiting for Blackburn?

694
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,275
Blackburn’s dead.

695
01:10:12,483 --> 01:10:14,067
Excuse me?

696
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:16,358
He would've been back by now.

697
01:10:18,483 --> 01:10:20,108
He's dead.

698
01:10:58,108 --> 01:10:59,108
Oh, shit.

699
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:10,525
Shit.

700
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:19,317
-Where is he?
-He's got to still be down here.

701
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:22,442
-He's dead! We're all going to be dead!
-Stop saying that!

702
01:11:22,483 --> 01:11:24,567
Pritchett, shut the fuck up!

703
01:11:24,775 --> 01:11:26,983
I just wanted to ask you a question.

704
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,900
-Price is behind this.
-How? He's still locked up.

705
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:32,317
Let's go see.

706
01:11:36,483 --> 01:11:38,275
It's Blackburn.

707
01:11:50,442 --> 01:11:51,567
Oh, my God.

708
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:52,608
Shit!

709
01:12:06,483 --> 01:12:07,733
You murderer.

710
01:12:33,442 --> 01:12:34,858
Melissa?

711
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:41,442
It's Sara.

712
01:12:43,733 --> 01:12:44,692
Help me.

713
01:12:46,442 --> 01:12:49,067
-Somebody!
-I'II help you.

714
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,317
Just keep talking.

715
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:09,567
It's okay.

716
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,192
I woke up on the floor.

717
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:24,900
Blackburn....

718
01:13:26,983 --> 01:13:28,442
Stay the fuck back!

719
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:30,525
I don't know what happened!

720
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:32,317
I do.

721
01:13:33,983 --> 01:13:37,150
Please, tell me. Help me.

722
01:13:37,483 --> 01:13:39,650
I don't think so!

723
01:13:40,317 --> 01:13:41,775
You got to help me.

724
01:13:44,733 --> 01:13:47,108
Not even for $1 million, Mr. Price.

725
01:13:52,275 --> 01:13:53,608
Help me.

726
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,358
Help me.

727
01:14:17,442 --> 01:14:18,483
Oh, shit!

728
01:14:20,817 --> 01:14:22,192
Grab her gun.

729
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:24,983
Damn, she emptied it. I got this.

730
01:14:25,192 --> 01:14:27,150
I got this, baby girl. Let go.

731
01:14:27,358 --> 01:14:28,608
There we go.

732
01:14:30,817 --> 01:14:32,275
I'II put this right here.

733
01:14:32,483 --> 01:14:33,942
Okay? Look, it's cool.

734
01:14:34,108 --> 01:14:35,608
It's me. Okay, it's me.

735
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,525
Look.

736
01:14:36,608 --> 01:14:37,608
Poor Mr. Price.

737
01:14:37,942 --> 01:14:39,275
Fuck Mr. Price.

738
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:42,275
Come on, baby girl. I got you.

739
01:14:42,483 --> 01:14:45,108
-Come on, it's cool.
-Let's get the hell out of here.

740
01:14:45,483 --> 01:14:46,650
I got you.

741
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,650
Okay, don't look. Keep going. Up we go.

742
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:52,400
Up we go, baby girl.

743
01:14:54,692 --> 01:14:57,692
Almost there. You just get upstairs.

744
01:14:57,983 --> 01:15:00,275
AII right, easy. Don't look.

745
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,733
You poor clueless old geek.

746
01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:34,942
AII it would've taken
was a simple divorce...

747
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:39,650
...and ripping our prenup to teeny,
itsy-bitsy little pieces.

748
01:15:42,483 --> 01:15:44,817
But no matter how it ended...

749
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:47,650
...please just know one thing:

750
01:15:48,775 --> 01:15:51,275
From the first moment I set eyes on you...

751
01:15:52,233 --> 01:15:55,192
...I have always, always loved...

752
01:15:56,317 --> 01:15:57,650
...your money.

753
01:16:01,317 --> 01:16:06,358
On the other hand, just the sight of you
has always made me want to puke.

754
01:16:08,317 --> 01:16:10,733
Is that a fact, princess?

755
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:14,900
Maybe you could have saved us all
a great deal of time...

756
01:16:15,108 --> 01:16:18,567
...not to mention money,
if you just let me in on it years ago.

757
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:19,942
Help!

758
01:16:21,775 --> 01:16:23,275
You must be kidding!

759
01:16:25,817 --> 01:16:28,733
I'm Steven goddamn Price!

760
01:16:33,442 --> 01:16:36,483
Every place you've gone,
every person you've seen...

761
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:40,108
...every word you and Blackburn
ever said to each other, bugged...

762
01:16:40,483 --> 01:16:43,442
...taped, seen and heard
by me as it happened!

763
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:46,317
-Sweetie?
-Anything, angel!

764
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:47,942
Just speak it!

765
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:50,108
What are you going to do?

766
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:57,108
Just what you wanted everyone here
to believe in the first place!

767
01:16:57,192 --> 01:17:00,817
I'm going to murder you, Evelyn,
with the greatest of pleasure!

768
01:17:01,942 --> 01:17:03,067
Witnesses.

769
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,525
They know you're already dead, Evelyn!

770
01:17:08,733 --> 01:17:11,192
Happy birthday, baby!

771
01:17:37,817 --> 01:17:38,817
Get up.

772
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,858
Are you doing this?

773
01:17:42,483 --> 01:17:43,317
No.

774
01:17:46,108 --> 01:17:47,233
Get up!

775
01:17:48,608 --> 01:17:49,817
Now!

776
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:56,692
Oh, Ms. Marr.

777
01:19:31,817 --> 01:19:33,900
Steven, I want you.

778
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:36,567
I've always wanted you.

779
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:39,192
We all do.

780
01:19:41,733 --> 01:19:43,400
They're all here.

781
01:19:43,983 --> 01:19:45,900
Everyone who's died.

782
01:19:46,775 --> 01:19:49,150
Everyone who's responsible.

783
01:19:50,608 --> 01:19:52,442
It's your turn.

784
01:19:55,233 --> 01:19:57,108
One, two, three.

785
01:20:23,817 --> 01:20:26,025
Open the door!

786
01:20:26,483 --> 01:20:28,858
-Somebody open the door!
-Oh, my God.

787
01:20:30,608 --> 01:20:31,733
It's Price.

788
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,275
Open the goddamn door!

789
01:20:37,233 --> 01:20:38,692
Price is dead.

790
01:20:39,108 --> 01:20:41,233
Open the goddamn door!

791
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:48,442
Open the goddamn door!

792
01:21:13,233 --> 01:21:14,692
Go!

793
01:21:18,233 --> 01:21:19,150
Run!

794
01:21:30,608 --> 01:21:31,608
Come on!

795
01:21:38,608 --> 01:21:40,233
What was that?

796
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,483
It can't be! You're dead!

797
01:21:43,442 --> 01:21:47,275
Pritchett was right. The house is alive.

798
01:21:52,817 --> 01:21:55,692
There's got to be something.
Pulleys or something.

799
01:21:57,525 --> 01:21:58,608
The attic!

800
01:22:32,817 --> 01:22:33,817
Come on!

801
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,025
Let's get to the attic!

802
01:22:58,108 --> 01:22:59,525
Hurry!

803
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:08,150
Come on!

804
01:23:20,775 --> 01:23:21,775
Terrific!

805
01:23:22,442 --> 01:23:23,567
Fuck!

806
01:23:39,483 --> 01:23:42,150
So much for a Ph.D. in engineering.

807
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,567
I found a way out!

808
01:23:45,775 --> 01:23:46,983
Where?

809
01:23:47,233 --> 01:23:48,275
Up here!

810
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:51,567
Hurry! There is something
of a time issue here.

811
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:06,650
Come on!

812
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:08,983
Where are you going?

813
01:24:10,733 --> 01:24:12,567
You have to stay for my show.

814
01:24:12,733 --> 01:24:13,942
Oh, God!

815
01:24:28,108 --> 01:24:33,317
There's light! Stay here, I'm going
to go and see if we can get out this way.

816
01:24:59,733 --> 01:25:00,775
Oh, shit.

817
01:25:08,983 --> 01:25:10,025
Go!

818
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:12,567
Help me, Eddie!

819
01:26:12,733 --> 01:26:15,567
The doctor is in.

820
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,525
No one gets out of here alive.

821
01:26:21,608 --> 01:26:24,192
Not me. Not you.

822
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,483
Next patient.

823
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,733
Ah, Mr. Baker.

824
01:26:31,108 --> 01:26:33,983
It's time to take your rightful place
with the others.

825
01:26:34,108 --> 01:26:35,900
I had nothing to do with this!

826
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:37,650
I was adopted!

827
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,942
Oh, God.

828
01:27:33,817 --> 01:27:34,942
What is this?

829
01:27:45,108 --> 01:27:46,442
What is it?

830
01:28:18,108 --> 01:28:19,567
Oh, my God.

831
01:28:21,567 --> 01:28:23,442
That was one kick-ass party.

832
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:27,400
Okay, one more thing:
how do we get down from here?
