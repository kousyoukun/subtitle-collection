00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:39,688
<b>House On Haunted Hill 
1999 Subtitle English</b>

2
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:49,490
October 11th 1931 Los Angeles.

3
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,257
A conflagration of biblical proportions
incinerates nearly everyone...

4
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,433
in what was once LA's most
celebrated medical facility:

5
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:03,397
The Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute
For the Criminally Insane.

6
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:07,404
But the secret this inferno burned
free was far more frightening...

7
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,740
than any picture
Hollywood could produce.

8
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,707
A sanitarium of slaughter...

9
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:15,410
supervised by a
surgeon gone mad:

10
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:19,111
Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

11
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:22,485
Doctor Richard
Benjamin Vannacutt.

12
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,091
Little known today...

13
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:28,363
but likely the most prolific
mass murderer of this century.

14
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,225
He out-butchered Bundy.

15
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,091
He made Manson look meek.

16
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,233
And the site of his carnage
still exists today...

17
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:38,336
restored almost to
its original state.

18
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:42,136
But it has yet to be
inhabited1 because some say...

19
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:44,373
the spirits of Vannacutt
and his victims...

20
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:48,611
still live within the walls
of the House on Haunted Hill.

21
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:52,282
No shit.

22
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:55,950
We'll be back with more
Terrifying But True in a moment.

23
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:58,288
No need, baby.

24
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,726
You just gave me
everything I needed.

25
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:19,239
Price.

26
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:21,507
Evelyn, how nice.

27
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:26,618
That is totally fucking fascinating,
but I've got to get back to you.

28
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,314
They're trying to shoot me here.

29
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:33,492
What is it, Mr. Price,
business or pleasure?

30
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:34,962
Neither. My wife.

31
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:39,593
Your roller coaster is quote, "Unlike
any that has come before it."

32
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:42,501
Absolutely. No cheap thrills.

33
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:44,540
A journey to the
brink of madness.

34
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:49,034
It just looks like a generic roller
coaster to me. What's the gimmick?

35
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:52,276
Ever seen one that
starts at the top?

36
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,420
Twenty stories worth of top?

37
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,364
Sources said the reason your
park's opening has been delayed...

38
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:12,592
was a near-fatal accident
on one of the rides here.

39
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:16,500
I wouldn't open this place
tomorrow if every single thing...

40
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:20,407
down to the beheaded Beanie Babies,
hadn't tested 100-percent safe.

41
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:23,872
What the hell was that?

42
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,312
Growing pains.

43
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,908
New steel must bend and stretch a
little before finally settling in.

44
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:36,756
Don't worry. In 15 years, Price
Amusements hasn't lost a customer.

45
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:40,529
I've designed and built six of these
places. Take my word for it...

46
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:42,189
everything's fine.

47
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:57,508
God forbid, if something
unexpected should happen...

48
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,908
there's always the safety cable.

49
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,178
That does what?

50
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:03,981
Keeps the cab from just...

51
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:12,127
Do something!

52
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:13,059
Like what?

53
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,790
This shouldn't be happening!

54
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,095
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

55
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:21,463
We're all going to die!

56
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,302
If you survived
Terror Incognito...

57
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:32,538
please exit the elevator now.

58
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:45,358
From here on, it
gets really scary!

59
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,803
All right, princess. Now,
what were you babbling?

60
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:43,217
Congratulations. On a scale of 1 to 10 on
the perversity meter, you just hit a 73.

61
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:57,463
Why don't we go and celebrate at
some nice, quiet little restaurant?

62
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,863
Houston, I think
we've got a problem.

63
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:05,666
Go stir your cauldron
or something for a sec.

64
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,872
Oh, shit!

65
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,073
We're going to fall!

66
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:16,377
Oh, my God!

67
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:20,048
Oh, my God!

68
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:22,620
Problem where?
Looked good to me.

69
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,887
Passenger six, he
keeps losing his arm.

70
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:28,760
Disengage the flailing-limb
mechanism. Make him into a screamer.

71
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:34,659
Here, dear, with a
suggestion: Forget it.

72
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,233
Haunted Hill is exactly where
we're having my party this year.

73
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:45,111
Now, you'll find the guest list
on your desk when you get back.

74
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:51,280
I got your guest list right
here, princess. Shredded.

75
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,302
I'm going to pull
out all the stops.

76
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:13,636
Excuse me, the people from HRS
Entertainment are getting antsy.

77
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,505
Tell them I'm right there.

78
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:50,734
Okay! Hi! Stop the
car! Get out, please!

79
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,999
Stop the car and get out.

80
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:55,467
Can you stop your
car? Stop your car!

81
00:13:55,545 --> 00:14:00,710
And get out of the car! Please, sir or
ma'am, whoever's in the car, get out!

82
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:03,650
Hi! Hello.

83
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,754
We must walk the rest of the way
because the driveway's out. Let's go.

84
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,388
Quickly.

85
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,051
Even quicker.

86
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:13,322
Did I say quicker?
I think I did.

87
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,225
I'm sorry. Hi, I'm Watson
Pritchett. I own the house.

88
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:17,926
So let's move, if we could.

89
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,428
So is this dump really haunted?

90
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:24,497
It's pretty scary.

91
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,802
Let's have a good time.

92
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:28,738
Hold up. I got one question.

93
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:32,611
Why is this Price dude inviting
us to a birthday party?

94
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,214
I never even heard of him.

95
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:38,947
Neither had I until he rented the place.
But now I must get you inside, okay?

96
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:41,283
This $1 million each, though...

97
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,490
That's for real?

98
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,355
Good question.
Don't have a clue.

99
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:47,690
Ask Price.

100
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,694
Is there a reason why we're
not moving forward at all?

101
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:55,201
Let me get a light. Then we can all
see, and no one'll trip or anything.

102
00:14:55,838 --> 00:14:58,136
Come on. Come on.
Little piece of shit.

103
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,942
There. That's better.

104
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:10,311
The lights are a nice
touch, Pritchett. Subtle.

105
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:13,216
Thanks. Worked hard
on it. Could we move?

106
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,617
Guess we know where
the Prices are.

107
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,522
Okay, let's go up further.

108
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:22,723
Goddamn, this place
is scary, yo.

109
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:24,553
Where's the party?

110
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:27,157
Looks like we're it.

111
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:29,698
Me and y'all three?

112
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,225
Let's boogie.

113
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,735
Where's our host, the
fabulous Mr. Price?

114
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:38,605
Fuck him. What in the
name of Christ is that?

115
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:47,614
It must be more of Price's
spook-house bogeyman bullshit.

116
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:49,449
Actually...

117
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,813
that's always been there. Back
when this was an asylum...

118
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:56,256
Dr. Vannacutt found
it inspirational.

119
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,518
It's from the Middle
Ages or something.

120
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:01,586
Driving Demons from the Mind.

121
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,128
Kind of scared me as a kid.

122
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,726
But...

123
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,435
doesn't really scare
me that much now.

124
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,242
It's touching.

125
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:18,011
- Are you going to come in?
- No, I'm good.

126
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,949
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price?

127
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:24,444
Any...

128
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:26,786
Price person?

129
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:28,617
I don't think anybody's here.

130
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:32,919
So maybe it was ghosts.

131
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,731
I knew this whole place
would be pure gold.

132
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,359
If I can just get something
bizarre enough on tape...

133
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:42,871
I think I can parlay it into
getting myself some sort of a...

134
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:44,964
Wackiest Home Videos gig.

135
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:46,741
You got your own TV show?

136
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,642
Had, sweetie. Past tense.

137
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:53,574
Currently looking for the right angle
to either earn or fuck my way back in.

138
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:56,243
Looks like someone's
trailer park is showing.

139
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,719
I wouldn't worry. I'm sure
by the end of the night...

140
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:02,315
we'll be hacked into
pieces by something or...

141
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,558
somebody.

142
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:25,043
Who the fuck are all of you?

143
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:43,064
Oh, shit.

144
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,634
I thought you were dead.

145
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,528
Not even fucking close.

146
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,565
Get off of me, you pervert.

147
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:52,464
Congratulations.

148
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:02,014
I don't think Evelyn's said those
words to anything with testicles.

149
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:03,752
Ever.

150
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,554
Very funny, Steven.

151
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:06,779
Have you?

152
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,950
I think you're taking this awfully well
for a woman who was just nearly killed.

153
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:16,826
Well, I guess you'll just
have to try harder next time.

154
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,324
That is, if you can get it up.

155
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:21,660
Not me, tulip.

156
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,304
The house.

157
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:26,805
I think it's marked you to be
the first to die this evening.

158
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,604
Isn't that how the story
goes, Mr. Pritchett?

159
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,779
You could say that. Sure.

160
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:35,409
Isn't that how both your father
and grandfather met their demise?

161
00:19:38,988 --> 00:19:42,788
Well, my grandfather
did build the place...

162
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:45,790
but he actually died
in his sleep in Miami.

163
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:47,793
My father was killed here.

164
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:52,457
But that was during a construction
accident while he was restoring interiors.

165
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,660
But I'm fine and...

166
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:57,863
I'm still alive,
and I feel good...

167
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,875
and I'd love to get paid now.

168
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:06,405
And on that mercenary note,
let the games begin.

169
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:10,050
Call me clairvoyant, but
haven't they already?

170
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,520
Finding that out is just one
of tonight's many amusements.

171
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:18,725
Sure is a funky old
house, ain't it?

172
00:20:21,998 --> 00:20:24,694
Let's have a word, sugar puss.

173
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:27,298
I think we ought
to have several.

174
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:34,040
This'll take a moment. You'll find
food and booze in the main salon.

175
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,511
Knock yourselves out.

176
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:02,128
I gave you a guest list two pages
long. Where the hell are they?

177
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:05,935
Shredded. Sorry. Decided
to whip up one of my own.

178
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,876
A group so hungry for money
they'd be willing to do anything.

179
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:11,345
I thought you'd be more
comfortable with your peers.

180
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:14,713
How stupid of me not to expect
something this twisted from you.

181
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:17,312
"Congratu-fucking-lations."
Round one...

182
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:18,812
you win.

183
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:21,757
Not quite. See, those
people down there...

184
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:23,855
they're not the ones I invited.

185
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,054
- Then who are they?
- You tell me.

186
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,990
I don't know how you managed to
hack into my computer, but...

187
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:31,090
bravo!

188
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:34,294
Come on. You think I'd invite
that bunch of social rejects?

189
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:36,903
Sure know it wasn't me,
and if it wasn't you...

190
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:39,066
then who the hell did? Ghosts?

191
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:41,966
Ooh, spooky.

192
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:46,972
If you really loved me, you'd find a way
to drop dead in the next three seconds.

193
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,950
Finding ways for me to die is
really your deal, isn't it, Evelyn?

194
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:56,925
Let's not forget the O.J. knife with
the not quite retractable blade.

195
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,162
Your "Jim Jones Kool Aid"
that was exactly that.

196
00:22:01,764 --> 00:22:05,200
Accidents. All accidents
until proven otherwise.

197
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:08,836
I'd be so happy if that
were really true, Evelyn.

198
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:11,073
And positively
goddamned delirious...

199
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,769
if you weren't fucking every
living thing in our area code.

200
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:18,405
Which part of that fantasy
turns you on the most?

201
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:21,413
Me with other men, or
just the other men?

202
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:25,520
Everything you do gets me hot,
just not in the sexual sense.

203
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:27,121
You're hurting me.

204
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,823
I know.

205
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,352
Well, there's the simple
country gal I married.

206
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:37,428
Let's go down and greet your
guests. Show them the real you.

207
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,798
Corny as Kansas on
the Fourth of July.

208
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:42,972
My guests were shredded. It's
your sick little scene now.

209
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:44,406
Enjoy.

210
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:49,638
I'm going to run scalding water on
the place you just touched me...

211
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:51,846
and then I'm calling a cab.

212
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,059
Mr. Price?

213
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:06,960
I think I've done a great job
of getting your guests here...

214
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,089
and I think I deserve
my money now!

215
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:10,598
Right here, Mr. Pritchett.

216
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:18,370
As well as five other bona fide
bank drafts for $1 million each.

217
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:21,073
Made out to cash.

218
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:26,078
That's what I'm talking about. And
we get paid this money when, sir?

219
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:30,748
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning
assuming you've stayed the entire night.

220
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:33,514
And you're still
alive, of course.

221
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,557
What are you talking about?

222
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,356
Sorry. Detail I guess
I forgot to mention.

223
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:41,360
You die, you lose.

224
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:44,691
Your check gets divvied up by
those still amongst the living.

225
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:48,794
But look at the bright side. If there's
only one of you still upright at dawn...

226
00:23:48,871 --> 00:23:51,931
you leave here with $5
million in your pocket.

227
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:53,367
This is crazy.

228
00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:54,535
Yes. But hey...

229
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:58,175
Anybody who's not comfortable with
the rules, you're free to walk.

230
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:00,408
Seven digits poorer,
goes without saying.

231
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:02,474
I'm ready. I'll walk. Now.

232
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:10,051
All right, Mr. Pritchett, just
let me sign the damn thing.

233
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:13,696
Just for the record, what
are the rest of your names?

234
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:16,964
Donald W. Blackburn, MD.

235
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:21,330
Melissa Margaret
Marr. Celebrity.

236
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:23,601
Eddie Baker. Pro...

237
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:26,198
former pro baseball player.

238
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,742
And you, young lady?

239
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,449
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP,
Lathrup International Pictures.

240
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:39,814
Very good.

241
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:43,592
Well, I think I can say
with complete honesty...

242
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:45,456
I've never heard of any of you.

243
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,320
Great, then why are we here?

244
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:52,596
How did you make the guest list?
Throw darts at a phone book?

245
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:56,466
I'm sure the unexplainable will
explain herself before too long.

246
00:24:56,906 --> 00:24:57,964
Jesus Christ.

247
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,474
That's it! Sorry to
interrupt here. Goddamn it!

248
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:03,168
You give me my goddamn
check, right now!

249
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:06,338
Because I want it!
So you give it!

250
00:25:08,017 --> 00:25:09,017
Now!

251
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:12,413
I'm serious!

252
00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:14,887
I'm sorry, Pritchett.

253
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,690
Here you go.

254
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:24,359
You're going to miss the
bash of a lifetime.

255
00:25:24,434 --> 00:25:25,162
My loss.

256
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,792
Even if I give you a million?

257
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,531
I wouldn't know what to do
with it all. Thank you.

258
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:44,547
I think I got to go now.

259
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,290
Interesting.

260
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:05,907
Fuck!

261
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:29,896
Now that's
"enter-fucking-tainment"!

262
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:36,538
This ain't moving, man.

263
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:41,436
Is this your idea of a joke?

264
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,844
Pritchett's not laughing.

265
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:50,285
Open! Open!

266
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:52,753
Open, you stupid, asshole bitch!

267
00:26:53,055 --> 00:26:54,420
What's going on?

268
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:56,691
What's going on?

269
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,455
Doctor.

270
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,626
- What happened here?
- Lock down.

271
00:27:01,697 --> 00:27:02,391
What is that?

272
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:05,298
It's a machine from the old
asylum. It seals everything shut.

273
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:08,633
It's how they burned to death in
'31. Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch.

274
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:11,172
If he was going to die,
they're all going to die.

275
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:14,773
Well, no wonder they're
still pissed off.

276
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:20,912
Let's go to the other room and
I'll take care of your hands.

277
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:24,510
The only ones that survived were five
of the sadists on Vannacutt's staff.

278
00:27:24,587 --> 00:27:26,316
Why hasn't that machine
been disabled?

279
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:28,949
It was on my dad's to-do list,
but the house did him first.

280
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:30,458
You said that was an accident.

281
00:27:31,661 --> 00:27:34,960
I lied. The house is alive.
We're all going to die.

282
00:27:40,336 --> 00:27:42,668
Why doesn't one of us
call out for help?

283
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:44,729
There aren't any working
phones in the house.

284
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:45,967
I've got my cell phone.

285
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:47,669
That won't do any good.

286
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:51,104
It's the metal plates.

287
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:53,848
It's not the plates.

288
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,110
It's the house! Why is
no one listening to me?

289
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,686
Did you just turn
deaf all of a sudden?

290
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:03,385
It's alive! We're not going
anywhere! That's it!

291
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,218
So we're stuck here forever?

292
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:09,787
No, a cleaning crew's supposed to
come at 9:30 in the morning... Jesus!

293
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:11,799
So we'll just stay
here till morning.

294
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,961
Yes, I'm sure we'll be mutilated
beyond recognition by then.

295
00:28:15,037 --> 00:28:19,804
Why do I feel this is a sick joke to scare
us out of our wits and a lot of money?

296
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,205
You got that right.

297
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:25,108
Take a bow, you sick fuck.

298
00:28:26,382 --> 00:28:28,282
You've outdone yourself tonight.

299
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:30,216
Scared the shit out of even me.

300
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,487
You've had your fun.
Open this place up.

301
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:36,955
Asking the wrong guy.
Wasn't me who closed it.

302
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,694
Sure it wasn't. Anybody else here make a
living with thrills and chills for the kids?

303
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:43,656
Don't all raise
your hands at once.

304
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:46,600
You're that Steven Price? As
in Price Amusement Parks?

305
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:48,867
Bravo.

306
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:57,209
This lock down thing, there's got to be a
main control room in this place, right?

307
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:59,847
In the basement, but you
won't want to go down there.

308
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:01,881
No, you don't want
to go down there.

309
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:05,352
We will both go down there and try
to put a reverse on this thing.

310
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:08,618
You're not going to want to
go down there. It's a maze.

311
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:11,190
Then that leaves you
with two options.

312
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:14,420
Either show me where and
maybe we get out of here...

313
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:17,031
or it's spend the
night, sleep tight.

314
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:24,237
Fine.

315
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:26,605
A word of advice, kitten.

316
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:32,478
God knows what kind of freak-outs
Steven's got set to spring in here.

317
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:36,247
If I were you, I'd bring something
to protect myself with.

318
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:42,852
Baby, don't you think now's the time
to break out your party favors?

319
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:44,721
What are you talking about?

320
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:48,230
Same exact setup you used back
in '94 for the Son of Sam hunt.

321
00:30:26,903 --> 00:30:30,361
Hilarious. Firearms this time.

322
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:33,405
Jesus Christ.

323
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:35,533
The clip's been welded shut.

324
00:30:35,745 --> 00:30:37,178
On all of them, probably.

325
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:41,311
So how's a girl to know if
these things are loaded, puff?

326
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:43,851
Only one way I can think of.

327
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,258
No.

328
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:58,192
I think I'll let the
virgin have first crack.

329
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:01,299
- I don't want a goddamn gun!
- I'll take it. Shit.

330
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:03,805
- Let's just go.
- I'll meet you all down there.

331
00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:05,704
And where are we
off to, Mr. Price?

332
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:08,209
Checking the wiring on
the animatronic mummies?

333
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:11,645
Just taking a leak if
it's okay with you.

334
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,484
- Careful.
- I got to say...

335
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:28,030
coming down here's a
really good idea.

336
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:30,426
I know I'm having a great time.

337
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,025
Yes, well, you're not
helping matters much.

338
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:35,627
Smells fantastic.

339
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,404
Ain't you handy to have around.

340
00:31:52,322 --> 00:31:53,812
I love how nothing works.

341
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:58,021
Let me get you some light.

342
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:18,746
These things.

343
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,623
I knew I should have
kept my ass at home.

344
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:02,519
- Damn.
- You're pretty handy yourself.

345
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:06,754
Take us where this thing's at.

346
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:12,862
- Come on, man.
- All right. Thank you. Got it.

347
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:23,507
Hey, Schecter!

348
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:27,883
Give me a few seconds notice
before you pull a stunt like that.

349
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,008
The lock down thing?

350
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:31,918
- Impressive! Scared all the right people...
- It wasn't me.

351
00:33:33,623 --> 00:33:34,715
What do you mean?

352
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:38,557
I was just sitting here and it
happened. I had nothing to do with it.

353
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:39,720
Then who did?

354
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:43,796
No idea. Maybe it was just the
thing's time to finally fall apart.

355
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:48,495
Somehow, I don't know how...

356
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:50,500
she did it.

357
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:58,476
You should really open up this
place to the public, Pritchett.

358
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:01,517
A spa for people without
enough stress in their lives.

359
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:03,108
That's funny. Sharp.

360
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:06,447
I'm the one who didn't want
to come down here, remember?

361
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:09,252
There haven't been any changes
to this part of the house...

362
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:12,123
since, I don't know, 1931.

363
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:14,961
Is that a fact, Mr. Pritchett?

364
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:15,892
Sorry.

365
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:18,159
That's a good way to get
your head blown off.

366
00:34:18,234 --> 00:34:19,895
I'll recommend it to Evelyn.

367
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:22,834
What's in there?

368
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,302
Someone went to a lot of trouble
trying to seal that up.

369
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:29,675
I don't know. I've
never been in there.

370
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:31,475
But it's not the way out.

371
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,482
Let's go down here
and take a right.

372
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:22,328
This is electroshock therapy.

373
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,800
There's several of these
rooms hooked together.

374
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:29,360
Dr. Vannacutt liked to zap his
patients in multiples of 18.

375
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:31,530
More energy efficient, I guess.

376
00:35:31,707 --> 00:35:33,538
Isn't that pleasant.

377
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:40,112
How about we go?

378
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:41,183
Great.

379
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,534
Oh, shit.

380
00:36:12,715 --> 00:36:14,478
Guess we should
have made a left.

381
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,676
What is this?

382
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:18,853
This is the saturation chamber.

383
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:21,780
What's a saturation chamber?

384
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:24,588
It's Vannacutt's treatment
for schizophrenia.

385
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:27,794
What would drive a sane man mad
would drive a mad man sane.

386
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,364
Something like that. I
don't know. Whatever.

387
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:34,703
It's supposed to bombard them
with images and weird noises...

388
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,863
and scare them back to normal.

389
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:39,571
Lot of fun.

390
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:41,174
Did it work?

391
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:42,971
I don't know.

392
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:44,569
Did it work?

393
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:47,610
Oh, fuck.

394
00:36:47,884 --> 00:36:49,283
Guys?

395
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,931
I do not want to
be lost down here.

396
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:35,294
This is not cool.

397
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,157
Let me try something.

398
00:37:41,337 --> 00:37:42,929
Can you get me up?

399
00:37:43,506 --> 00:37:45,497
Here, watch out.

400
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:53,675
Hey, pal...

401
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:56,183
that wasn't code for...

402
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,649
For what?

403
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:02,152
Could you just shine
the light here?

404
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:03,224
Absolutely.

405
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:07,618
All right.

406
00:38:08,297 --> 00:38:09,730
What are you looking for?

407
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:12,791
This whole place can't be
wired to just one circuit.

408
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:20,342
Careful.

409
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,043
Better than nothing.

410
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:29,117
Not bad.

411
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:30,882
Down, big guy.

412
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:39,892
Thanks.

413
00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:42,595
That was the most fun
I've had all day.

414
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:45,496
You need to get out more.

415
00:38:53,576 --> 00:38:55,237
So who are you...

416
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:56,840
really?

417
00:38:57,213 --> 00:39:00,205
What? You mean like
deep down inside?

418
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:04,352
We can start with the name you were
given at birth, take it from there.

419
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:07,522
I told you already. Jennifer
Jenzen, Executive VP...

420
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:10,089
You're lying. And
I don't think so.

421
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:11,259
Why not?

422
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,195
I've never met an executive
who could tie their shoes...

423
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:16,754
much less rewire an
entire building.

424
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:19,366
- Well, there's always exceptions.
- No.

425
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:20,568
What's the truth?

426
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:24,437
The truth is, if we keep taking rights,
we'll end up where we started.

427
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:31,045
We'll be out of here in a while and go
our separate ways a $1 million richer.

428
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:33,939
So what does it matter
who I am or who I'm not?

429
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:38,276
Okay, so let's say, hypothetically,
I'm not exactly who I said I was.

430
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:40,417
So you're right,
you're a genius.

431
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:43,717
I don't know anyone that could've
seen through me like that.

432
00:39:47,063 --> 00:39:48,063
Look...

433
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:50,664
my real name is Sara,
and I'm an assistant.

434
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:55,432
Was, anyway, to the real Jennifer
bitch that was invited here.

435
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:58,801
And now you know. And I'm begging
that you don't tell anyone...

436
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:02,901
because I'm out of a job and could
use even a tenth of that money.

437
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:22,531
You know, if this is your
idea of funny, think again.

438
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,173
In fact, you're really
starting to piss me off.

439
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,210
Eddie, wait!

440
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,921
For a second I actually thought
that you were a decent guy.

441
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
What is your problem?

442
00:41:57,794 --> 00:41:59,819
Okay, you win.

443
00:42:01,164 --> 00:42:03,689
You've successfully
creeped me out.

444
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:32,419
What are you doing?

445
00:42:58,488 --> 00:42:59,488
Come on!

446
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:01,012
Take my hand!

447
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:13,599
What the hell are you doing?

448
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:42,227
Well, lookie. Looks like
the games have begun.

449
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:44,696
- Where's Price?
- What happened to you?

450
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:46,198
Are you all right?

451
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:49,534
No, I am so fucking far from
all right it's not even funny.

452
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:54,369
Someone or something just tried
to drown me in a tank of blood.

453
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:57,379
Let me give you a hint.

454
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,104
His initials are S.P.

455
00:44:00,216 --> 00:44:02,411
All right. S.P.

456
00:44:02,952 --> 00:44:04,579
As in "sorry, petunia."

457
00:44:04,954 --> 00:44:07,582
I was with Pritchett, looking
for the master control.

458
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:11,154
It doesn't seem to exist.

459
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:12,755
Look at this.

460
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,058
What is this?

461
00:44:15,631 --> 00:44:18,361
That? What just happened to
you there? That's nothing.

462
00:44:18,434 --> 00:44:21,267
Wait'll somebody lets out
the darkness in this place.

463
00:44:21,437 --> 00:44:24,929
That's a whole new bunch of crazy
shit. You'll hate that shit.

464
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:26,735
What is this darkness?

465
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,168
It! The thing! The evil!

466
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:32,146
The thing that's the rotten core
at the bottom of this place!

467
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:35,673
The thing that's going to kill us
all! Death by corrosion. That thing!

468
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:42,788
- Are you under the care of a physician?
- No, I'm not.

469
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:45,994
Well...

470
00:44:46,629 --> 00:44:49,427
either we spend the night
and collect our money...

471
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,559
or we try to find a
way out of here.

472
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:55,263
Either way, I think we
should all stick together.

473
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:58,966
But maybe that's not going to
fit in with your plans, baby.

474
00:44:59,942 --> 00:45:02,308
You know me. The
more, the merrier.

475
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:06,914
I guess somebody better go find
the old game-show hostess.

476
00:45:06,983 --> 00:45:08,314
Where is she?

477
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:28,459
This is great.

478
00:47:24,453 --> 00:47:27,115
I guess Melissa found
what she was looking for.

479
00:47:36,866 --> 00:47:38,857
Jesus. She's dead.

480
00:47:40,336 --> 00:47:41,928
She was cute too.

481
00:47:42,305 --> 00:47:45,297
God, I'd love to get
laid before I died.

482
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:50,403
How you doing tonight?

483
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:55,861
Yes, I'm all right.

484
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:02,364
Is she all right?

485
00:48:03,276 --> 00:48:04,709
I don't know.

486
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:18,089
What the hell is this?

487
00:48:24,931 --> 00:48:27,058
It seems to just stop here.

488
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:30,336
Shit, she's got to
be somewhere...

489
00:48:30,403 --> 00:48:34,305
because she couldn't have just
disappeared into thin air.

490
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:37,543
Not air.

491
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,623
Into the house.

492
00:48:56,396 --> 00:48:58,864
There's got to be a way
out of this house.

493
00:48:58,932 --> 00:49:00,399
Some way.

494
00:49:01,735 --> 00:49:02,735
What?

495
00:49:02,736 --> 00:49:03,998
I'm talking to you!

496
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,005
- What is your deal? That wasn't nice.
- Easy! Easy!

497
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:10,568
If everyone's going to scream at each
other, do it in another room, please.

498
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,440
Watch it!

499
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:14,912
I'm about to figure out exactly
what, or who, Melissa was taping.

500
00:49:15,615 --> 00:49:17,173
Then where will we be?

501
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,582
Out of scotch,
thanks to you, ass!

502
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:23,651
I think I got something.

503
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:56,923
Bravo.

504
00:50:00,227 --> 00:50:03,355
I know it's not good manners to
ask the magician how he did it...

505
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,728
but inquiring minds are
desperate to know.

506
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:08,359
Just what did really happen
to little Miss Marr?

507
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:13,400
Asking the wrong person.

508
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:17,106
I mean, did she stage it all
for you and then go hide?

509
00:50:17,911 --> 00:50:20,573
Or did you just flat out
kill the little bitch?

510
00:50:20,648 --> 00:50:22,548
I pose you the same question.

511
00:50:22,616 --> 00:50:24,311
Who's next on your list?

512
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:27,714
If I had one, Evelyn,
whom do you think?

513
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:31,755
For God sakes, we all know that knocking
me off is the bottom line here.

514
00:50:34,294 --> 00:50:36,990
You know I'm not going
to make it easy for you.

515
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:41,534
You think that's going to do
the trick, do you, tulip?

516
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:43,797
I would never give
you a loaded gun.

517
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,140
Jesus!

518
00:50:48,008 --> 00:50:50,476
Funky old house, ain't it?

519
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,317
Friends, your hostess is now going to
retire for what's left of the night.

520
00:50:58,485 --> 00:51:01,477
If you need me, I'll be
upstairs in the bedroom.

521
00:51:02,156 --> 00:51:05,023
And if anyone so much as
peeks in the keyhole...

522
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:08,456
I'm going to empty this thing
into their fucking head.

523
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:22,836
Come on.

524
00:51:23,343 --> 00:51:25,072
I loaded them with blanks.

525
00:51:28,415 --> 00:51:30,849
And even if I were going
to murder my wife...

526
00:51:30,918 --> 00:51:34,911
I don't think I'd do it in a locked
house with quite so many witnesses.

527
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:37,151
Take this.

528
00:51:40,828 --> 00:51:43,456
What good is a million
dollars if you're dead?

529
00:51:47,534 --> 00:51:49,934
Let's find a way to
get out of here.

530
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:53,703
I'm going to try
to find Ms. Marr.

531
00:51:57,177 --> 00:52:00,544
I'm going to go find
me something to drink.

532
00:52:04,918 --> 00:52:06,886
How is she pulling this off?

533
00:52:47,494 --> 00:52:48,961
Ms. Marr?

534
00:53:06,246 --> 00:53:08,680
You son of a bitch,
I know you're here.

535
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:15,941
What is happening?

536
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:21,080
Electroshock!

537
00:54:34,534 --> 00:54:35,865
Oh, Jesus.

538
00:54:37,504 --> 00:54:38,504
God, no!

539
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:40,332
Don't touch her!

540
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:41,806
Well, turn it off!

541
00:54:43,377 --> 00:54:45,845
For God's sake,
somebody do something!

542
00:54:47,347 --> 00:54:49,440
Somebody turn the
damn thing off!

543
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:56,221
Somebody! Do something!

544
00:54:58,058 --> 00:54:59,184
Turn it off!

545
00:55:00,794 --> 00:55:03,388
There's got to be a
switch or something!

546
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,542
I'm sorry.

547
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:27,516
She's not dead. We must get
her heart pumping again.

548
00:55:27,587 --> 00:55:28,849
It's too late.

549
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:50,566
Baby, I'm so sorry.

550
00:55:54,614 --> 00:55:56,343
I swear to God, it's this house.

551
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:57,713
Fuck the house!

552
00:55:58,585 --> 00:56:00,075
It wasn't the house!

553
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:02,417
It wasn't goddamn ghosts!

554
00:56:02,622 --> 00:56:05,682
This is, plain and simple,
good old-fashioned homicide.

555
00:56:09,463 --> 00:56:13,194
Was it too complicated for you? Let
me spell it out for you then, kids.

556
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:15,867
A: Evelyn sure as hell
didn't kill herself.

557
00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:18,700
B: I know I didn't do it.
Which just leaves us with C.

558
00:56:18,772 --> 00:56:21,764
One of you motherfuckers
murdered my wife!

559
00:56:21,975 --> 00:56:23,806
You're talking crazy, Price.

560
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:28,579
Who'II tell me about the strange guy
with the mustache and the lab coat...

561
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:31,617
who I've been chasing all
over this goddamn house?

562
00:56:31,852 --> 00:56:33,149
Vannacutt.

563
00:56:33,353 --> 00:56:34,445
Jesus.

564
00:56:36,023 --> 00:56:37,456
Some little shit...

565
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:41,051
working for one of you, hoping
to pocket several million bucks.

566
00:56:41,128 --> 00:56:42,823
Now I want some answers.

567
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:47,330
Put that away.

568
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:50,297
Put the gun down, Mr. Price.

569
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:51,561
Back up, honey.

570
00:56:51,638 --> 00:56:53,936
There's a one in four
chance it's you.

571
00:56:54,307 --> 00:56:56,775
Put the gun down!

572
00:56:57,377 --> 00:56:59,174
Let's see who blinks first.

573
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:27,300
What do we do with him?

574
00:57:35,482 --> 00:57:37,109
Open this fucking door!

575
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,987
- You sure this thing will hold him?
- It won't be a problem.

576
00:57:45,993 --> 00:57:47,153
Come on.

577
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,957
You going to make sure
he doesn't get out?

578
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:53,758
I'll stay and keep
an eye on him.

579
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:55,358
You'll be okay by yourself?

580
00:57:55,636 --> 00:57:56,660
I hope.

581
00:58:01,141 --> 00:58:04,577
I have to tell you, I'm just a
little bit uncomfortable with this.

582
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:06,010
I'm sure you are.

583
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:14,677
Open the goddamn door!

584
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:20,025
What?

585
00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:24,197
Open the goddamn door!

586
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,692
I can't! I'm sorry, I can't.

587
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,541
What's this?

588
00:58:37,344 --> 00:58:38,368
This!

589
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:44,074
Anything?

590
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:45,650
Open this fucking door!

591
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:47,311
How about this?

592
00:58:58,565 --> 00:58:59,565
Better?

593
00:59:09,243 --> 00:59:10,733
Great party!

594
00:59:11,845 --> 00:59:13,073
I got to go!

595
00:59:13,647 --> 00:59:14,739
Blackburn!

596
00:59:29,897 --> 00:59:32,798
Wrong way. I think we should
have taken a right back there.

597
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:34,295
Back where?

598
00:59:34,802 --> 00:59:36,497
Damn it. Good point.

599
00:59:38,438 --> 00:59:40,599
Let's just try down here.

600
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:52,282
Yo, Sara, look.

601
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:56,179
Vannacutt's office.

602
01:01:45,899 --> 01:01:48,390
You've been sick, Mr. Price.

603
01:01:50,737 --> 01:01:54,798
And what do you
think, Dr. Vannacutt?

604
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:35,266
Look here.

605
01:03:36,143 --> 01:03:37,735
What do you got?

606
01:03:38,412 --> 01:03:39,845
Class of 1931.

607
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,414
That's a cheery-looking bunch.

608
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:45,041
Better living through
electricity.

609
01:03:49,556 --> 01:03:50,682
I think...

610
01:03:54,027 --> 01:03:55,858
Oh, my God!

611
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:59,158
I know how the guest
list was made.

612
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:00,832
Look at these names.

613
01:04:00,901 --> 01:04:02,835
"Head nurse, Ruthe
Ann Stockard."

614
01:04:02,903 --> 01:04:04,894
"Electroshock, Adolphus Jenzen."

615
01:04:05,005 --> 01:04:06,131
"Franklin Baker."

616
01:04:06,206 --> 01:04:08,401
"Thomas Steven
Price. Jasper Marr."

617
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:11,335
- They're all here!
- Who? I'm missing something.

618
01:04:11,411 --> 01:04:13,208
Everyone that was invited...

619
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,146
is related to one of the staff that
was here when the place burnt.

620
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:20,376
There was five of us.

621
01:04:21,655 --> 01:04:23,646
Five that didn't die.

622
01:04:23,857 --> 01:04:25,347
Booga-booga.

623
01:04:27,461 --> 01:04:28,655
What are you saying?

624
01:04:28,728 --> 01:04:30,320
Price didn't make the list.

625
01:04:30,397 --> 01:04:31,659
The house did.

626
01:04:36,236 --> 01:04:38,704
Because she's a
vengeful, stupid whore!

627
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:44,006
How's the house going to
send out invitations?

628
01:04:44,244 --> 01:04:46,269
There's a lot of energy in here.

629
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,648
It likes to travel
through light beams...

630
01:04:49,983 --> 01:04:51,245
sound waves...

631
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:53,010
electricity, whatever.

632
01:04:53,086 --> 01:04:54,314
A phone line?

633
01:04:55,422 --> 01:04:57,913
Sure, now that we're
in The Twilight Zone.

634
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:01,488
Into an on-line computer?
Through the Internet?

635
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:04,754
No, stop. Wait. This is crazy.

636
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:07,198
You don't...

637
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,493
get it, do you?

638
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,773
This house is pissed.

639
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,944
It has no morals.

640
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:23,207
Because it's a fucking house!

641
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:24,544
This is insane.

642
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:27,849
- Calm down.
- All right, I'm sorry about that.

643
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:33,286
Wait.

644
01:05:35,362 --> 01:05:37,762
How come Blackburn's
name's not on here?

645
01:06:02,456 --> 01:06:07,052
The late Mrs. Steven
Price. Tragic.

646
01:06:11,064 --> 01:06:12,588
Tortured.

647
01:06:14,434 --> 01:06:15,901
Lovely.

648
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:29,776
And suddenly very
cooperative Mrs. Price.

649
01:06:43,096 --> 01:06:44,495
Cool.

650
01:07:00,848 --> 01:07:02,839
What do you think you're doing?

651
01:07:06,153 --> 01:07:08,781
Easy. Easy. Lie back. Be still.

652
01:07:09,456 --> 01:07:12,323
Last thing we need is for you
to have a real heart attack.

653
01:07:12,392 --> 01:07:14,155
You're the doctor, kid.

654
01:07:14,962 --> 01:07:17,123
I guess that atropine
crap worked.

655
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:19,822
Yes. Convinced all those
that needed convincing.

656
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,494
You are officially
one dead lady.

657
01:07:22,669 --> 01:07:24,830
Trust me, I've been
dead for years.

658
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:27,830
Speaking of which,
what's Steven's status?

659
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,732
Well, he's still alive...

660
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:32,210
but it's just a
question of moments.

661
01:07:32,446 --> 01:07:36,041
And then your miraculous
resurrection.

662
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:40,076
No, Officer, I'm
very much alive.

663
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,448
Just a little joke to beat my
husband at his own clever game.

664
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:45,491
I'm sorry, ma'am,
your husband's dead.

665
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:48,357
What do you mean, he's dead?
Oh, no, it's all my fault.

666
01:07:48,528 --> 01:07:50,860
I may as well have
killed him myself.

667
01:07:51,064 --> 01:07:54,397
No, not at all. We have all
these witnesses that saw...

668
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:57,468
Well, fill in the blank, whoever
it'll be that shoots him.

669
01:07:57,537 --> 01:07:59,266
I don't know. Puff Eddie?

670
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:04,773
This could be a big surprise. I think the
Jenzen girl. She's got the right stuff.

671
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:08,837
Did you ever find out what happened
to that little TV reporter?

672
01:08:10,884 --> 01:08:12,511
No, we never found her.

673
01:08:12,586 --> 01:08:15,521
So we don't even know if the
bitch is dead or alive.

674
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:20,685
Price must've killed her.
There's no other explanation.

675
01:08:20,894 --> 01:08:25,490
There's plenty! For all we know Steven's
got her spying on us right now!

676
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:27,059
Bullshit.

677
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:29,731
God, this whole fucking
thing's falling apart.

678
01:08:29,803 --> 01:08:31,236
It's not, baby, it's not.

679
01:08:31,305 --> 01:08:33,000
Somebody'll pull the trigger.

680
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,367
But nobody has yet, Donald.

681
01:08:35,575 --> 01:08:37,202
They're not at the
breaking point.

682
01:08:37,277 --> 01:08:39,336
They must believe their
lives are in danger!

683
01:08:39,413 --> 01:08:42,314
They have your death at his hands.
How much more do they need?

684
01:08:42,382 --> 01:08:44,009
But they didn't see it happen.

685
01:08:44,084 --> 01:08:46,780
They still have their
doubts. They're confused.

686
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:50,915
What we need...

687
01:08:51,124 --> 01:08:52,751
is another body...

688
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,688
and Steven's bloody
hands right next to it.

689
01:08:56,296 --> 01:08:58,560
How the hell are we
going to do that?

690
01:09:01,435 --> 01:09:04,131
This may sound a little
crazy, but hear me out.

691
01:09:54,855 --> 01:09:56,584
This is all I could find.

692
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:03,660
This here.

693
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:06,891
Well, it's going to have to do.

694
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:10,636
Are you coming, or
waiting for Blackburn?

695
01:10:10,904 --> 01:10:12,804
Blackburn's dead.

696
01:10:13,006 --> 01:10:14,598
Excuse me?

697
01:10:14,808 --> 01:10:16,867
He would've been back by now.

698
01:10:19,012 --> 01:10:20,639
He's dead.

699
01:10:58,652 --> 01:10:59,676
Oh, shit.

700
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:11,093
Shit.

701
01:11:16,403 --> 01:11:19,895
- Where is he?
- He's got to still be down here.

702
01:11:20,073 --> 01:11:23,008
- He's dead! We're all going to be dead!
- Stop saying that!

703
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:25,169
Pritchett, shut the fuck up!

704
01:11:25,378 --> 01:11:27,573
I just wanted to ask
you a question.

705
01:11:28,748 --> 01:11:31,512
- Price is behind this.
- How? He's still locked up.

706
01:11:31,585 --> 01:11:32,916
Let's go see.

707
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:38,887
It's Blackburn.

708
01:11:51,071 --> 01:11:52,163
Oh, my God.

709
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:53,239
Shit!

710
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,348
You murderer.

711
01:12:33,714 --> 01:12:35,113
Melissa?

712
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:41,714
It's Sara.

713
01:12:43,991 --> 01:12:44,991
Help me.

714
01:12:46,727 --> 01:12:49,355
- Somebody!
- I'll help you.

715
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,597
Just keep talking.

716
01:13:08,782 --> 01:13:09,874
It's okay.

717
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,485
I woke up on the floor.

718
01:13:23,964 --> 01:13:25,192
Blackburn...

719
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:28,768
Stay the fuck back!

720
01:13:29,036 --> 01:13:30,833
I don't know what happened!

721
01:13:31,471 --> 01:13:32,631
I do.

722
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:37,471
Please, tell me. Help me.

723
01:13:37,811 --> 01:13:39,972
I don't think so!

724
01:13:40,647 --> 01:13:42,114
You got to help me.

725
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:47,452
Not even for $1
million, Mr. Price.

726
01:13:52,626 --> 01:13:53,957
Help me.

727
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:56,729
Help me.

728
01:14:17,818 --> 01:14:18,842
Oh, shit!

729
01:14:21,188 --> 01:14:22,553
Grab her gun.

730
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:25,358
Damn, she emptied
it. I got this.

731
01:14:25,559 --> 01:14:27,527
I got this, baby girl. Let go.

732
01:14:27,728 --> 01:14:28,990
There we go.

733
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:32,631
I'll put this right here.

734
01:14:32,866 --> 01:14:34,333
Okay? Look, it's cool.

735
01:14:34,501 --> 01:14:35,968
It's me. Okay, it's me.

736
01:14:36,036 --> 01:14:36,900
Look.

737
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:37,994
Poor Mr. Price.

738
01:14:38,305 --> 01:14:39,670
Fuck Mr. Price.

739
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:42,664
Come on, baby girl. I got you.

740
01:14:42,876 --> 01:14:45,504
- Come on, it's cool.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

741
01:14:45,879 --> 01:14:47,039
I got you.

742
01:14:48,215 --> 01:14:51,048
Okay, don't look.
Keep going. Up we go.

743
01:14:51,118 --> 01:14:52,779
Up we go, baby girl.

744
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:58,114
Almost there. You
just get upstairs.

745
01:14:58,392 --> 01:15:00,690
All right, easy. Don't look.

746
01:15:29,523 --> 01:15:32,151
You poor clueless old geek.

747
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:35,389
All it would've taken
was a simple divorce...

748
01:15:35,595 --> 01:15:40,089
and ripping our prenup to teeny,
itsy-bitsy little pieces.

749
01:15:42,936 --> 01:15:45,268
But no matter how it ended...

750
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:48,098
please just know one thing:

751
01:15:49,242 --> 01:15:51,733
From the first moment
I set eyes on you...

752
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:55,671
I have always, always loved...

753
01:15:56,783 --> 01:15:58,114
your money.

754
01:16:01,788 --> 01:16:06,816
On the other hand, just the sight of
you has always made me want to puke.

755
01:16:08,795 --> 01:16:11,195
Is that a fact, princess?

756
01:16:12,099 --> 01:16:15,364
Maybe you could have saved us
all a great deal of time...

757
01:16:15,602 --> 01:16:19,060
not to mention money, if you
just let me in on it years ago.

758
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:20,436
Help!

759
01:16:22,275 --> 01:16:23,765
You must be kidding!

760
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:29,214
I'm Steven goddamn Price!

761
01:16:33,954 --> 01:16:36,980
Every place you've gone,
every person you've seen...

762
01:16:37,057 --> 01:16:40,618
every word you and Blackburn ever
said to each other, bugged...

763
01:16:40,994 --> 01:16:43,963
taped, seen and heard
by me as it happened!

764
01:16:44,798 --> 01:16:46,823
- Sweetie?
- Anything, angel!

765
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:48,464
Just speak it!

766
01:16:49,202 --> 01:16:50,635
What are you going to do?

767
01:16:54,374 --> 01:16:57,639
Just what you wanted everyone here
to believe in the first place!

768
01:16:57,711 --> 01:17:01,340
I'm going to murder you, Evelyn,
with the greatest of pleasure!

769
01:17:02,482 --> 01:17:03,574
Witnesses.

770
01:17:06,686 --> 01:17:09,052
They know you're
already dead, Evelyn!

771
01:17:09,256 --> 01:17:11,724
Happy birthday, baby!

772
01:17:38,385 --> 01:17:39,385
Get up.

773
01:17:40,954 --> 01:17:42,444
Are you doing this?

774
01:17:43,056 --> 01:17:44,056
No.

775
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,786
Get up!

776
01:17:49,162 --> 01:17:50,390
Now!

777
01:18:55,795 --> 01:18:57,353
Oh, Ms. Marr.

778
01:19:32,099 --> 01:19:34,158
Steven, I want you.

779
01:19:34,501 --> 01:19:36,867
I've always wanted you.

780
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:39,472
We all do.

781
01:19:42,009 --> 01:19:43,670
They're all here.

782
01:19:44,278 --> 01:19:46,178
Everyone who's died.

783
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,446
Everyone who's responsible.

784
01:19:50,918 --> 01:19:52,749
It's your turn.

785
01:19:55,522 --> 01:19:57,422
One, two, three.

786
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:26,346
Open the door!

787
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,186
- Somebody open the door!
- Oh, my God.

788
01:20:30,924 --> 01:20:32,050
It's Price.

789
01:20:32,226 --> 01:20:35,627
Open the goddamn door!

790
01:20:37,564 --> 01:20:39,031
Price is dead.

791
01:20:39,466 --> 01:20:41,559
Open the goddamn door!

792
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:48,803
Open the goddamn door!

793
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,067
Go!

794
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:19,605
Run!

795
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:32,018
Come on!

796
01:21:38,992 --> 01:21:40,619
What was that?

797
01:21:40,794 --> 01:21:42,887
It can't be! You're dead!

798
01:21:43,864 --> 01:21:47,698
Pritchett was right.
The house is alive.

799
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,107
There's got to be something.
Pulleys or something.

800
01:21:57,945 --> 01:21:59,037
The attic!

801
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,280
Come on!

802
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,497
Let's get to the attic!

803
01:22:58,605 --> 01:23:00,004
Hurry!

804
01:23:07,581 --> 01:23:08,639
Come on!

805
01:23:21,294 --> 01:23:22,294
Terrific!

806
01:23:22,963 --> 01:23:24,089
Fuck!

807
01:23:40,013 --> 01:23:42,675
So much for a PH.D.
in engineering.

808
01:23:44,751 --> 01:23:46,116
I found a way out!

809
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:47,513
Where?

810
01:23:47,754 --> 01:23:48,812
Up here!

811
01:23:49,022 --> 01:23:52,116
Hurry! There is something
of a time issue here.

812
01:24:06,206 --> 01:24:07,206
Come on!

813
01:24:07,441 --> 01:24:09,136
Where are you going?

814
01:24:10,878 --> 01:24:12,743
You have to stay for my show.

815
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,108
Oh, God!

816
01:24:28,262 --> 01:24:33,495
There's light! Stay here, I'm going to
go and see if we can get out this way.

817
01:24:59,927 --> 01:25:00,985
Oh, shit.

818
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:10,227
Go!

819
01:26:11,498 --> 01:26:12,863
Help me, Eddie!

820
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,867
The doctor is in.

821
01:26:17,671 --> 01:26:20,799
No one gets out of here alive.

822
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:24,469
Not me. Not you.

823
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:28,773
Next patient.

824
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:31,014
Ah, Mr. Baker.

825
01:26:31,418 --> 01:26:34,285
It's time to take your rightful
place with the others.

826
01:26:34,421 --> 01:26:36,184
I had nothing to do with this!

827
01:26:36,256 --> 01:26:37,951
I was adopted!

828
01:27:09,723 --> 01:27:11,281
Oh, God.

829
01:27:34,181 --> 01:27:35,307
What is this?

830
01:27:45,492 --> 01:27:46,823
What is it?

831
01:28:18,492 --> 01:28:19,982
Oh, my God.

832
01:28:21,962 --> 01:28:23,862
That was one kick-ass party.

833
01:28:24,564 --> 01:28:27,829
Okay, one more thing: How
do we get down from here?
