the first thing we found out
about each other

was how much we both loved

of our three voices,

710

that sound on a record.

Her grace, her humor.

She's one of the funniest people I know. 
She cracks me up.

Dolly rose from the humblest
of family beginnings

she's brought joy to fans
in countless other ways.

But it has been in me a lot longer.

804
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,708
I used to stand out on the porch

back at my old Tennessee mountain home.

806

I used to put a tobacco stick
down in a crack in the floor,

807
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,884
put a tin can on top of it,

808
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:43,180

on the Grand Ole Opry.

00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,766
and it has been such a privilege
to be a part of this night

886
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,436
that is beyond well deserved.

887
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,148
Nights like this were made for icons
like Dolly Parton

888
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,192
who is joined tonight
by one of the greatest,

889
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,652
Linda Perry.

890
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,196
[Miley] Linda, this is about you too.

891
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,033
You have inspired me
to wake in the morning

892
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,284
and step outside,

893
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,453
to take a deep breath and,
my favorite part,

894
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,121
get real high,

895
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,165
and scream at the top of my lungs,

896
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,375
"What's going on?"

897
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,629
I love you both so much.
Linda and Dolly Parton, everybody.

898
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,756
-[Dolly] Oh, thank you so much.
-[applause]

899
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,259
Miley, I love you,
and we did not coordinate our outfits.

900
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,429
We were laughing backstage
when we saw we were both wearing black.

901
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,306
But I'm honored to be here with Linda.

902
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,935
We've been doing some really good work,
and I asked her if she'd play tonight.

903
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:58,852
Thank you again.

904
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,771
-Linda, are you ready?
-I'm ready.

905
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,565
This is the story of my little coat
of many colors.

906
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,443
'Cause it's kind of the song
that got me here.
