the first thing we found out

Oh, thank you so much. Hello, everybody.

799
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,447
[cheering]

800
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,034
I have been in music for a long time.

801
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,704
But it has been in me a lot longer.

802
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,708
I used to stand out on the porch

803
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,752
back at my old Tennessee mountain home.

804
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:37,007
I used to put a tobacco stick
down in a crack in the floor,

805
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,884
put a tin can on top of it,

806
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:43,180
and pretend like I was singing
on the Grand Ole Opry.

807
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,266
'Course I'd sing to the chickens
and the ducks and the pigs

808
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,937
and the little kids
that were too young to crawl off.

809
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,896
[Dolly laughing]

810
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,481
But it was my dream.

811
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,942
And it's a long way

812
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,236
from the hills of East Tennessee

813
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:02,533
to the Hollywood Hills,
but it has been a wonderful journey.

814
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,284
Now, people say to me,

815
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,538
"Well, wasn't it a man's world
back when you got in the business?"

816
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,040
I said, "It sure was, and, buddy,
I had a ball."

817
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,125
[crowd laughing]

818
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,878
Because I have actually worked with
so many wonderful men,

819
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,798
and I've never met a man
that I didn't like

820
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,300
and I've never met a man
whose ass I couldn't kick

821
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,053
if he didn't treat me
with the right respect.

- [Dolly laughing]
- [cheering]

'Cause you got to remember,

824
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,643
I also still have that pistol in my purse,

825
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,105
and I can still change 'em
to a rooster to a hen with one shot.

826
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,690
- [Dolly chuckling]
- [cheering]

827
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,817
'Cause these nine-inch nails

828
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,319
and five-inch stilettos
are lethal weapons.

829
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,529
But seriously.

830
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,949
- [crowd laughing]
- It's been such a thrill for me tonight

831
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,618
to see all these great artists

832
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:50,330
that are singing songs that I've written
or been a part of.

833
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,124
'Course…

834
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,126
It's sort of like…

835
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,628
Watching them is sort of
like watching porn.

836
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,713
[crowd laughing]

837
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,966
You're not personally involved,
but you still get off on it.

838
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:01,925
So I...

839
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,011
- [Dolly laughing]
- [laughing, cheering]

840
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,639
I really got off on this show tonight.

841
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,143
- [crowd laughing, whistling]
- [Dolly] Hey, now, don't blame me.

842
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,479
At my age,
you'll take anything you can get.

843
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,438
[laughing]

844
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,940
- But seriously…
- [Dolly chuckling]

845
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,359
And I'm still hoping
that I live long enough

846
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,862
to get the Betty White longevity award.

847
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,822
- [crowd laughing]
- And I'm working on it.

848
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,367
Anyway, I feel so honored and proud

849
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,663
to be part of all of this
'cause I know that MusiCares

850
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,417
really is such a wonderful cause.

851
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:39,004
And so I'm happy
that we raised a lot of money.

852
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,673
And I want to commend this wonderful band,

853
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,218
Greg and all the musicians.
Didn't they do a great job?

854
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,719
- And the singers.
- [applause]

855
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,181
In addition to all of the artists,
I'm so proud of that.

856
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,266
And I know it's late.

857
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,186
- And I know you wanna pee, I know I do.
- [crowd laughing]

858
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:58,065
So I'm gonna kinda do one more song
if you don't mind.

859
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,983
I'm gonna walk over, though

860
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,111
and meet up with a friend of mine,
Linda Perry,

861
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:07,074
who's worked with me on a few things.
I had my nails too long to pick tonight

862
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:11,119
'cause I'm getting ready for the Grammys.
So thank you again, and God bless you.

863
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,955
- Okay? All right.
- [crowd cheering]

864
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,752
[Miley] Hello, everybody.

865
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,674
Two blondes in sparkly black dresses.

866
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,634
I stole this from her.

867
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,761
What an honor to be in this room

868
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,014
celebrating the fabulous life and career

869
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,809
of my fairy godmother, Dolly Parton.

870
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,312
[cheering, applause]

871
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,438
[Miley chuckling]

872
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,483
Everyone always asks me what it's like

873
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,735
to have Dolly as a godmother,

874
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,863
and I say she isn't just mine,

875
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,574
but she's everyone's fairy godmother.

876
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:52,411
And I share her joyfully
with the entire world.

877
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,748
Teaching us all what it means
to be truly kind,

878
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,252
to be individual, to never give up,

879
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,880
and to never judge a book by its cover

880
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,215
or its huge boobs and big hair.

881
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,843
- [Dolly laughing]
- [Miley] I got jokes too.

882
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,305
But seriously, tonight is a family affair,

883
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,766
and it has been such a privilege
to be a part of this night

884
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,436
that is beyond well deserved.

885
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,148
Nights like this were made for icons
like Dolly Parton

886
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,192
who is joined tonight
by one of the greatest,

887
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,652
Linda Perry.

888
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,196
[Miley] Linda, this is about you too.

889
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,033
You have inspired me
to wake in the morning

890
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,284
and step outside,

891
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,453
to take a deep breath and,
my favorite part,

892
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,121
get real high,

893
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,165
and scream at the top of my lungs,

894
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,375
"What's going on?"

895
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,629
I love you both so much.
Linda and Dolly Parton, everybody.

896
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,756
- [Dolly] Oh, thank you so much.
- [applause]

897
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,259
Miley, I love you,
and we did not coordinate our outfits.

898
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,429
We were laughing backstage
when we saw we were both wearing black.

899
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,306
But I'm honored to be here with Linda.

900
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,935
We've been doing some really good work,
and I asked her if she'd play tonight.

901
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:58,852
Thank you again.

902
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,771
- Linda, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

903
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,565
This is the story of my little coat
of many colors.

904
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,443
'Cause it's kind of the song
that got me here.
