Welcome back,

is Gail
Abernathy-McCadden-Feinberger.

Oh, this one's
gonna stick, John.

Well, you saved the Jew for last.
I did. I did.

where the

have broken down

in their path, haven't they, Gail?

just earned her green card, John.

She may have to
do that backflip

right back over

where to look.

Happy birthday,

The Australian singer
who calls herself "Fat Amy"

67
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,915
gave the President
a birthday gift from down under

68
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,249
during last night's
celebration

69

held at the historic
Kennedy Center.

70
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,587
In case you're wondering
what I mean by "down under," Chip,

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,172
I'm talking about her (BLEEP).

72
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,507
She showed her (BLEEP)
to the President.

73
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,681
All eyes were on the a cappella singers,
the Barden Bellas.

74
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,060
...three-time defending
a cappella national champions,

75
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,854
which is a real thing,
apparently.

76
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,607
Although authorities
have ruled out terrorism as a motive,

77
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,610
the Bellas claim the mishap
was merely an accident

78
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,028
and issued an apology.

79
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:44,075
I am deeply sorry
for the upset that I have caused.

80
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,287
I feel that I have
already received punishment enough

81

in the form of silk burn.

It's filth.

85
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,462
Women who sing
are just another example

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,839
of cultural decay,
due to loose morals.

87
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,174
Not wearing underwear

88
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,968
seems kind of intentional to me.
Mmm.

89
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,512
Yeah, you either choose to wear underwear,
or you don't wear underwear.

90
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,180
It's a choice
I make every day.

91
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,766
You know, until today,
I thought singing a cappella

92
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,060
was the most embarrassing
thing you could do.

93
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,937
Normally,
that group is on point,

94
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,647
and last night,
they were off-point,

95
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,065
off-key,
and then on the floor.

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,233
It's a national disgrace.

97
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,776
Yeah, but I'd
rather be in that

98
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,236
limo ride home
with the President.

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,880
Cut to the real President,
he'd be like,

100
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,948
"That (BLEEP) was off the hook!"

They're not gonna
burn us for witchcraft.

104

No, but the National
A Cappella Association

105
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,025
is in there talking
to the dean about us,

106
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,429
and who knows
what's gonna happen?

107
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,028
We won three championships.

108
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,952
Whatever happens in there,
we're gonna be fine.

109
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,615
Maybe it's time to
think about other stuff.

110
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,034
What other stuff?

111
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,286
You know,
school, jobs, life.

112

This group is my life.

113
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,540
I've intentionally failed
Russian Lit three times

114
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,000
so I could be a Bella.

115
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,794
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to us.
Ever.

116
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,506
You know,
before coming to Barden,

117
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,717
I had diarrhea
for seven years.

118
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,138
But yes, this is terrible.

119

122
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,438
you have dragged
the good name

123

of Barden University
into the gutter.

124
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,485
And you've really
upset these people

125
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,570
whose names
I've already forgotten.

126

Your little southern exposure
in front of our Commander-in-Chief

an example must be made.

131
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,252
It is the decision
of this governing body

132
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,380
that the Bellas
are hereby suspended

133

from competing at the collegiate level.

of your suspension

Okay, can we be reasonable?

In other words, they're gonna
keep their pants on.

145
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,617
So we can't defend our title
and we can't tour?

hold any auditions.

to grow like a fungus.

action has shocked you.

Especially since
you're all seniors.

But the truth is,

154

you're just women.

00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,312
Oh, I can't.

160
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,438
I just can't do it.

161
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,523
Mom, you can do it.

162
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,526
My only daughter,
leaving the nest.

163
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,405
(SINGING)
If you leave me now

164
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:14,493
You'll take away
the biggest part of me

165
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,078
Mom.
You want me to stop?

166
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,483
(SINGING)
Or I could keep singing!

167
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,831
No, I don't know
how I'm gonna get by

168
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,250
without your
spontaneous singing.

169
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,669
Oh, honey, you're gonna
love this place.

170
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,838
Just promise you'll call.

171
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,216
Oh, and, honey,
don't be afraid to express yourself.

172
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,886
And not with those weird buttons
they wear in their earlobes.

173
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,596
Unless you're gonna get a job...
Mom, slow down.

174
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,472
I'm not gonna do
anything crazy.

175
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,877
I'm just gonna write my songs
and join an a cappella group.

176
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,436
Not just
any a cappella group.

177
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,522
The Bellas
are an institution.

178
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,050
My days as a Bella
were the best...

179
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,650
Best days of your life.

180
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,361
I know.
And I can't wait to be one.

181
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,822
Unless they don't
take me, Mom.

182
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,074
Oh, no, honey,
they're gonna take you.

183
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,619
Thanks to me,
you were born into it.

184
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,537
And then I'm gonna
be your mother...

185
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,290
(SINGING) And your sister

186
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,875

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

188
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,796
All right,
the next phase of my life

189
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,633
begins.

190

CHLOE: Hold on.

191
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,553
There is nothing in here
that strips us of our national title.

192
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,388
And if we're still
reigning champs,

193
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,891
then we are automatically invited
to represent America

194
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,434
at the World Championships
this spring.

195
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,062
Ah, yes, the World
Championships of A Cappella,

196
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,480
where, every four years,

197
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,608
groups from around the globe
compete for world domination.

198
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,277
I'm sorry. I just feel
like I always have to be on, you know.

199
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,737
JOHN: Yeah. Yeah.
Well, look, ladies,

200
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,241
we can't stop you from
going to the Worlds competition.

201
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,909
It's not gonna
help your case here.

202

(SCOFFS)
Like, you...

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,001
You out-perform
the other groups?

Yeah. If we win,
will you reinstate us?
GAIL: Sure.

215
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,898
But no American team
has ever won.

216
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,317
That's because they hate us.

217

The whole world.

218

No one cares about you. All right.

You have made a great choice,
and a cheap one.

This is on all of us.

then what are we?

When I was nine years old, my brother
tried to sell me for a chicken, so...

to get back to the top.

you are so spirited. I...

It looks like the competition
has been dominated

by that stupid German group
that took over our tour.

303
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,484
You mean "stole" our tour.
AMY: Word.

304

We need to scout
those Deutsche-bags.

But how good can they be?

307
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,950
Germany hasn't produced
a good singer since David Hasselhoff.

We're gonna crush them.

And when we do,

310
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,121
we can stick it
to these chumps

311

this hate mail, like,

00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,676
Has anyone talked
to Beca today?

317
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
JESSE: So?

318
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,886
Any first-day jitters?

319
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,680
No, no.
You know, I'm just gonna

320
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,473
be moody and distant.
Artists love that.

321
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,558
I know I love that.

322
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,310
Here you go.

323
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,519
Okay.

324
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,439
Dude, why do I
feel so guilty?

325
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,003
I've given a lot to
the Bellas, right?

326
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,442
It's, like,
three years of my life.

327
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,820
Yeah, Bec, you should not feel
guilty at all about taking your shot.

328
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,988
This is a big deal, right?

329
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,198
Yes, it's a very big deal.
Okay.

330
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,701
Go.
All right.

331
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,372
Nothing's gonna stop my girl!

332
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,749
I don't know him!

333
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,125
Becs in effects, y'all!

334
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,710
You can go!

335

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

336
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,766
Are you ready, or...
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

337
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,581
Okay, everybody, huddle up.

338
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,501
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Get up!

339
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,670
Come on!
To the table, please!
To the table!

340
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,506
Last one at this table has to
help Frank watch YouTube videos

341
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,132
to find
the next Justin Bieber.

342
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,842
Hey, so, I'm turning 25
next week,

343
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,928
if anybody wants to
get some drinks, celebrate.

344
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,138
Frank, buddy, less talk.

345
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,848
Thank you so much.

346
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,017
Okay, my people, check it out.

347
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,478
That...

348
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,774
This... Dax, the tech guy.
Did you call the tech guy?

349
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,192
Yeah, I talked to him.

350
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,445
Do you understand that
everything else in my life works?

351
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,863
Uh-huh.

352
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,657
So, I just need everything here to work,
too, okay?

353
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,826
Well, he said he was gonna call me back.
Oh, my God.

354
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,906
You want me to call him now?

355
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,871
(WHISPERING) Don't do it now.

356
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,248
Okay.

357
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,791
There we go.

358
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,877
That is the Lion himself.

359
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,381
That is the legendary
Snoop D-O-Double-G

360
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,134
singing White Christmas
at a tree-lighting ceremony in Moscow.

361
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,261
And he was so moved
by the power of music

362
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,054
to unite the world
or some shit,

363
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,515
that now he wants to drop
his own cool Christmas album.

364
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,809
And because I sleep
on a bed of Grammys,

365
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,353
he has decided to hire me
to produce it. Now...

366
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,439
But Snoop Dogg already dropped
a Christmas album.

367
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,566
If you had listened to
the album like I did,

368
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,778
stranded in the air with T.I.
on a golden hang glider,

369
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,198
then you would have known
that none of the songs were the classics.

370
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,160
I've had to listen to that
album on two separate occasions.

371
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,870
Hang glider with T.I.

372
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,497
and also a rocket ship
that Eminem has built.

373
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,458
It doesn't go anywhere,

374
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,460
but he's got dreams
for it, okay?

375
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,171
So I need you to
close your mouth.

376
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,173
Herein lies the problem,
everybody.

377
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,301
Last time I checked, there are
over a million Christmas albums

378
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,928
with the same
10 damn songs on them.

379
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,764
So, guys,
I'm telling you, man,

380
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,016
I need all hands
on deck right now

381
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,186
to come up with ideas
on how to make this one stand out.

382
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,729
Okay? You got it?

383
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,898
Fire when ready.
I want to hear ideas.

384
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,691
Anything.

385
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,526
Anybody.

386
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,652
Anybody right now
would be great.

387
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,279
Anybody to talk...
What if we got those dogs...

388
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,822
Anybody but you.

389
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,909
What if we got those dogs
that bark Jingle Bells to back him up?

390
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,619
And let me, let me,
let me guess, let me guess.

391
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,914
You want those dogs
to back him up because he's "Snoop Dogg"?

392
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:44,998
Yeah!

393
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,958
That is a really great example

394
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,794
of a horrible idea.

395
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,630
Take a lap.

396
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,508
What?
Take a lap.

397
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,009
But I'm wearing skinny jeans.

398
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,093
I don't care.

399
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,428
Go. Go.

400
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,721
Let's go.
I wanna see knees up.

401
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,890
Knees up, please.

402
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,906
Guys, I should give you
a little more time.

403
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,895
A minute. You got
one minute. 60 seconds.

404
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,524
My time is like a toddler in a tiara, okay?
Precious and short.

405
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,485
I need really great ideas.
Snoop is coming!

407
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,668
Oh. Sorry, my boobs are all crazy.
I was just jumping.

408
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,046
(STAMMERING)
I just came from auditions.
You guys weren't there.

409
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,006
I was hoping for the chance
to sing for you.

410
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,884
No, can't help you.
We're not allowed to take anyone else new.

411
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,261
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

412
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,971
I'm a Junk!

413
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,472
What'd you say
about your junk?

414
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,642
I'm Emily Junk.

415
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,686
I know, it's weird.
It's my mom's last name.

416
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,521
My dad's last name
is Hardon, so...

417
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,357
Um...

418
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,777
I'm a Legacy.

419
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,320
Junk. Junk.

420
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,114
My mom was a Bella.

421
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,366
Your mother is Katherine Junk?

422
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,450
Who?

423
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,161
Only the top bitch
of the 1981 Bellas.

424
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,455
She pioneered
the syncopated booty shake.

425
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,958
And word is she has
a five-octave vocal range.

426
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,126
EMILY: Yep, still does.

427
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,212
You do not want to hear
that woman doing it with my dad. Whew.

428
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,172
What an odd thing to say.

429
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,257
True.

430
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,634
If a Legacy wants to audition,
we have to let her.

431
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:20,844
Okay, um...

432
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,890
Show us what you got.

433
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,642
Right now? Right here?
Right here, right now.

434
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,019
Yeah.

435
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,398
Okay, um, I'd like to perform an
original song that I've been working on.

436
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,859
I'm not quite finished
with it though,

437
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,819
so let's not be
dicks about it.

438
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,614
Sorry, that was crass,
wasn't it?

439
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,407
Fat Amy,
you have a lovely vagina.

440
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,367
Thank you. Proceed.

I'll be on my own

Darkness all around...

447
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,186
No. That one, I'm not... I'm still
kind of tinkering with that verse.

448
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,521
So it's not... Nothing's
really completely set.

for just one second?

She's pretty good.
Can't we take her?

458
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,721
What do you expect us to say?
She's standing right there.

(CHUCKLES)

460
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,642
She's definitely not a soloist.
No.

461
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,728
Technically, she came to us,
so really we're not breaking any rules.

462
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,271
Yeah,
it's the perfect loophole.

463
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,983
You know, it's always good
to have an extra body.

it was creepy

that she never really opened

How do you say that?
A heated mess.

644
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,547
You know, a mess where
heat is applied to it,

645
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,384
so what once was a little
messy is now even messier.

646

please take my advice.

is that we have fun, right?

So thank you for reminding me.

Yeah, Bec,
we're gonna need that ASAP

give me some pointers, maybe.

gonna put me in the songs, but I...

you all came. Come on in.

What can we do for you?

802
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,382
So, last week when I was
having a tinkle, it occurred to me...

803
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,884
Do not, do not!

804
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:48,761
Sorry.

805
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,012
That was rude.

806
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,182
You do not come to a gentleman's
house and touch his goose.

807

So are we early, or...

808
00:39:56,478 --> 00:40:00,439
Actually, you're pretty late.
Come on, let's go!

Another verbal beatdown.

815
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,633
Highlight of my day.

816
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,637
So, have you abandoned your
foolish plans to face us at the Worlds?

You wish,
you gorgeous specimen.

I'll be happy to
send you there.

821
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,524
I'll mail you.

822
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,859
Large envelope costs nothing.

823
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,861
PIETER: Well, it will cost
more than nothing.

824
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:52,407
But still cheaper than shipping, like,
a horse, or perhaps an adult moose.

825
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,201
Did you ever think
maybe you're too big?

826
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,078
It would cost a fortune to mail you.
CHLOE: Easy.

You're enormous!

829
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,916
I think we should change
her name to "Feisty Mouse."

Yeah.

a taller pair of shoes.

832
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,587
Wasn't a big deal.

with that internship that you sneak off to?

1109
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,525
What?

1110
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,444
Um...
Come on, Beca.

1111
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,529
You know how we do
that thing every month

1112
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,783
where I take $20 out of your purse
and you pretend not to notice?

1113
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,327
I saw your ID badge
in your bag.

1114

Let's just focus
on your lie.

1120
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,173
Beca,

1121
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,008
why didn't you tell us?

1122
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,511
Or at least Chloe.

1123
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,639
I don't know. Just...
'Cause it's just easier.

1124
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:17,475
There's, like, so much going on,
and Chloe would lose her mind

1125
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,853
if she thought my sole focus
wasn't winning Worlds.

1126
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,897
Sorry, it's just
now I'm freaking out,

1127
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,233
because it turns out,
like, I'm totally

1128
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,193
not good enough to
be a music producer.

1129
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,613
Which is cool and fun to know
as I enter the rest of my life.

stop you right there.

talented person that I know,

how awesome you are?

a bit more.

Okay. Thank you.
You just need that.

the good stuff now.

The reason that I
brought you here tonight

was because
I was thinking that

01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,291
Well, I can't un-see it.

1265
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,876
It's haunted me ever since.

1266
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,085
Well, there's
a picture of it right here.

1267
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,129
No. This should not be
your screensaver, John.

1268
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,925
JOHN: Stepping onto the stage,
the Barden Bellas.

1269
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,677
(BELLAS HUMMING)

1270
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,221
(SINGING ELECTROPOP SONG)

1271
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,375
Whoa!
All right!

1272
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,628
This is some exciting stuff.
GAIL: So sassy!

1273
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:02,838
(SINGING TECHNOPOP SONG)

1274
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,573
JOHN: Wow.
A lot going on up there.

1275
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:30,908
I think this sounds good.

1276
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,327
Honestly, my senses
are overwhelmed here, John.

1277
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,205
JOHN: They might wanna
tone down the theatrics.

1278
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,623
Let's hope
there are no props.

1279
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,667
GAIL: Oh, they brought
the props out, John.

1280
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,710
JOHN: And there are the props.

1281
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,046
This is more of a circus act than
an a cappella performance.

1282
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,714
Gail, it's as if
the Barden Bellas

1283
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,299
just don't know
who they are anymore.

1284
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,636
(CONTINUES SINGING)

1285
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,478
LILLY: Whoa!

1286
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:00,771
GAIL: Look at this!

1287
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,815
She's on fire! She's on fire!

1288
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,067
CYNTHIA: Oh, my God!
I'm on fire!

1289
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,402
JOHN: Now they lit
one on fire.

1290
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,529
Good day! Good heavens!
(GASPS) Oh.

1291
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,364
FLO: Incoming!
CYNTHIA: Oh, my God,
I can't breathe!

1292
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,575
I can't breathe, girl!
Fat Amy, I can't breathe!

1293
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,828
GAIL: Beating DSM seems
impossible for this team.

1294
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,913
Even these
common people can see

1295
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,666
that the Barden Bellas
have no shot at reinstatement.

1296
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,418
They are
an embarrassment

1297
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,670
to a cappella
and all that it stands for.

1298
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,299
This is what happens
when you send girls to college.

1299
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:30,092
Is it?

1300
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,060
Is that for a class?

1301
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,937
No, it's just
when I get stressed,

1302
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,342
words sort of
flow right out of me

1303
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,857
and I try and channel them
in my songwriting...

1304
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,860
Are we just gonna ignore
what happened back there?

1305
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:48,944
Guys, hello?

1306
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,738
The Worlds are
right around the corner

1307
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:53,449
and you guys are acting like
we didn't just eat a big bag of... Ahhh!

1308
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:54,617
Why are you yelling at me?

1309
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,036
I almost burned to death
because of you a-ca-bitches.

1310
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,454
If you almost died,
it was only because

1311
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,872
you were standing
in the wrong spot.

1312
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,624
No! Flo flipped into me!

1313
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,751
Sure. Blame the minority.

1314
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,629
I'm black, gay, and a woman.

1315
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,797
I'm not pointing
the finger at anybody.

1316
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,215
It was Legacy's fault.

1317
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,467
Me? Wait, I didn't...

1318
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,071
Obviously, we're not gonna
beat Das Sound Machine at their game.

1319
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,555
So we need a new plan.
Like, now.

1320
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,602
At times like these,
there's only one thing for us to do.

1321
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:24,688
Fake your own death
and flee the country.
CHLOE: Close.

1322
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,733
We're going on a retreat.

1323
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,779
KATHERINE: Look, I think the
retreat will be a good thing.

1324
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,657
You girls need to bond
heading into Worlds.

1325
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:35,824
It'll be so much fun.

1326
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,118
I don't know.
No, Mom, it's bad. It's...

1327
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,621
The girls are yelling at each other.
Oh, big deal.

1328
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,581
I remember
putting your godmother,

1329
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,416
Maggie Pistol,
in a choke hold,

1330
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,710
because she insisted
that George Michael was gay.

1331
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,837
Who?
Oh.

1332
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,466
I'm just worried that
my entire Bella career

1333
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,760
will be that
one terrible performance.

1334
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:58,013
And I'll never get to solo
at Lincoln Center, you know?

1335
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,848
But you're gonna
get to go to Europe.

1336
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,935
That would have been
the highlight of my college career.

1337
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,603
And you girls can win it.

1338
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,105
You have to win it.

1339
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,982
You just made being a Bella
sound so amazing.

1340
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,776
And it is amazing.

1341
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:14,571
It's a sisterhood that is gonna
support you for the rest of your life.

1342
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,615
I know you're not feeling it,

1343
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:17,991
but you will.

1344
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,703
This won't be the end
of the Bellas.

1345
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,216
Hey, Benji.

1346
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,467
Emily!

1347
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,597
Listen, I think you're missing a word here.
What's that?

1348
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:44,309
Oh, God. No.
That's not... That isn't
what I meant. I just...

1349
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,394
EMILY: I didn't think so.

1350
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,854
That's really embarrassing.
No, it looks...

1351
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:47,980
Syntax is usually my forte,

1352
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,690
so I don't know how that happened.
Well, it looks great.

1353
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,316
Thank you.
That's really sweet...

1354
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:53,694
Um...

1355
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,698
When my hands aren't
covered in glitter paint,

1356
01:07:57,866 --> 01:08:00,075
do you think maybe
we could try that again?

1357
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,912
Yeah. Sure.

1358
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,623
All right. Okay. Well...

1359
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,377
(STAMMERING)
I'll look forward to that.

1360
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:11,545
Just, you know,

1361
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,590
let me know when they're clean.
That's...

1362
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:15,758
I will.
All right.

1363
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:16,925
You bet.
Okay.

1364
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,677
All right. Have a good one.

1365
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,016
CHLOE: Okay, girls!
Everyone, in the bus.

1366
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,059
Go, go, go!

1367
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,227
CHLOE: Let's go.
FLO: Okay.

1368
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,437
CHLOE: Seatbelts!

1369
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,521
(HONKING HORN)

1370
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,231
EMILY: Good luck, Benji!

1371
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,494
This place is sweet!

1372
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:47,414
It's nice, right?

1373
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,342
I need to find somewhere
to charge my laptop.

1374
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,408
How'd you hear
about this place?

1375
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:53,003
From yours truly.

1376
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,671
Hello, Bellas.

1377
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,048
ALL: Aubrey!

1378
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:58,342
AMY: Aubrey!
FLO: Aubrey!

1379
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,804
Okay, girls.

1380
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,180
Oh, wow. Hi!
You must be Emily.

1381
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,557
EMILY: Hey, hey.
Hey. Hi.

1382
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,393
Welcome to
The Lodge at Fallen Leaves,

1383
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,187
where Fortune 500
companies send

1384
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,939
their employees to
build teamwork skills.

1385
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,816
You run this whole place?

1386
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,150
You know,
I realized I had a knack for

1387
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,444
barking orders and
bending people's will.

1388
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,613
So I made a career out of it.

1389
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:20,906
(ALL LAUGHING)

1390
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,241
Which reminds me,

1391
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,992
fall in line, Bellas!

1392
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,157
CYNTHIA: She ain't changed.

1393
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,162
No slouching! No straggling!

1394
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:29,081
I see you, Jessica.

1395
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:33,460
It is with great
sorrow and regret

1396
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:37,673
that I had to watch
our once proud organization

1397
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,926
become a national disgrace!

1398
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,471
Can I have the keys
to the minibar?

1399
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:46,014
Zip it.

1400
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:50,352
The Worlds signifies
a shot at redemption.

1401
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,020
You don't have
a chance at winning

1402
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,439
until you find
your sound again.

1403
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,234
You have totally
lost your harmony!

1404
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,028
So, for the next two days,

1405
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,866
you will be doing everything
together until you regain it.

1406
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:07,160
Ladies,
get ready to be transformed.

1407
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,081
You are surrounded with
the strength of your fellow Bellas

1408
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:15,210
and the support of
a proud female tradition.

1409
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,254
And a few dozen bear traps.

1410
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,630
So don't stray too far
from the marked paths.

1411
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,883
Okay, great, let's go!
EMILY: All right.

1412
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:23,468
Well, maybe I'll just
start with a hot shower,

1413
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,761
maybe a little foot rub.

1414
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,764
Fat Amy, there are no
guest rooms for you.

1415
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,933
Then where are we staying?

1416
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,651
I don't understand camping.

1417
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,112
We're voluntarily

does seem like it,

I'll teach underprivileged

So, after I graduate
there's a chance I will be deported.

1619
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:48,366
I will try to
re-enter this country,

"The Ladyboys."

That wasn't the
name of the group, I don't think.

I think that's how
they described themselves.

01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:09,839
That's right.
They're "Manila Envy."

1814
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:10,923
Manila Envy.

the Koreans are out there,
