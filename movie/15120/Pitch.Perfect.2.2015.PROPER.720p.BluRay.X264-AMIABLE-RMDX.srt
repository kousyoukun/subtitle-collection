1
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,500

Welcome back, a cappella enthusiasts.

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,860

My name is John Smith,

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,100

and sitting here to my left

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,340

is Gail Abernathy-McCadden-Feinberger.

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,780

Oh, this one's gonna stick, John.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,100

- Well, you saved the Jew for last. - I did. I did.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,660

You're listening to Let's Talk-Appella,

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,580

the world's premiere downloadable a cappella podcast.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,940

We are coming to you live from the nation's capital,

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,418

where the Barden University

11
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,124

Bellas are about to rock the historic Kennedy Center.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,700

Boy, these girls have broken down

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,860

every single barrier in their path, haven't they, Gail?

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,041

Absolutely, John.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,527

The first all-female group to win a national title,

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,007

three-time defending champs, and now, here they are,

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,673

performing for the President

18
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,620

of the United States on his birthday.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,420

Wow! What an inspiration

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,633

to girls all over the

21
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,967

country who are too ugly to be cheerleaders.

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,530

Here's Beca Mitchell, leader of the group.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,100

Look at these sequins and sparkles.

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,567

Oh, my! Their feet just don't stop moving.

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,780

Florencia Fuentes just earned her green card, John.

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,540

She may have to do that backflip

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,563

right back over the fence into Mexico.

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,060

I think she's Guatemalan.

29
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,400

Oh, none of that matters.

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,674

There is so much happening on stage,

31
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,020

I don't even know where to look.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,900

Back in my day, we put on our blazers and we just sang.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,082

We maybe snapped our fingers if we were feeling frisky.

34
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,580

Whoa! Another surprise!

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,500

An overweight girl dangling from the ceiling.

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,046

- Who hasn't had that dream? - Lots of us.

37
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,561

No!

38
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,860

- Okay, she has no underwear on. - Oh, my God.

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,086

We have a commando situation.

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,220

There is a commando situation on stage!

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,845

Who is on top of this?

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,420

- What kind of person... - Holy cow!

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,460

- Take her back up. She's turning. - Pull her up already!

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,210

- She's turning. Brace yourselves. - No.

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,540

She's coming. She's coming!

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,700

Avert your eyes, or take it all in! Make your choice!

47
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,140

Not the front! Nobody wants to see the front!

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,526

Oh, no!

49
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,900

Happy birthday, Mr. President.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,780

The Australian singer who calls herself "Fat Amy"

51
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,900

gave the President a birthday gift from down under

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,015

during last night's

53
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,580

celebration held at the historic Kennedy Center.

54
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,580

In case you're wondering what I mean by "Down under," Chip,

55
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,140

I'm talking about her...

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,527

She showed her... to the President.

57
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,660

All eyes were on the a cappella singers, the Barden Bellas.

58
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,060

...three-time defending a cappella national champions,

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,820

which is a real thing, apparently.

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,580

Although authorities have ruled out terrorism as a motive,

61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,580

the Bellas claim the mishap was merely an accident

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,045

and issued an apology.

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,060

I am deeply sorry for the upset that I have caused.

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,260

I feel that I have already received punishment enough

65
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,620

in the form of silk burn.

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,220

Exhibit C.

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,260

No, no, no!

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,361

It's filth.

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,460

Women who sing are just another example

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,820

of cultural decay, due to loose morals.

71
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,160

Not wearing underwear

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,940

- seems kind of intentional to me. - Mmm.

73
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,516

Yeah, you either choose to wear underwear,

74
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:04,500

or you don't wear underwear.

75
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,180

It's a choice I make every day.

76
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,740

You know, until today, I thought singing a cappella

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,081

was the most embarrassing thing you could do.

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,930

Normally, that group is on point,

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,620

and last night, they were off-point,

80
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,060

off-key, and then on the floor.

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,220

It's a national disgrace.

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,346

Yeah, but I'd rather be

83
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,220

in that limo ride home with the President.

84
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,860

Cut to the real President, he'd be like,

85
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,962

"That... was off the hook!"

86
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,620

Chloe, chill out. It was a mistake.

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,340

They're not gonna burn us for witchcraft.

88
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,500

No, but the National A Cappella Association

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,065

is in there talking to the dean about us,

90
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,281

and who knows what's gonna happen?

91
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,020

We won three championships.

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,963

Whatever happens in there, we're gonna be fine.

93
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,606

Maybe it's time to think about other stuff.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,020

What other stuff?

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,260

You know, school, jobs, life.

96
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,420

This group is my life.

97
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,540

I've intentionally failed Russian Lit three times

98
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,980

so I could be a Bella.

99
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,811

This is the worst thing that's ever happened to us. Ever.

100
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,500

You know, before coming to Barden,

101
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,728

I had diarrhea for seven years.

102
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,124

But yes, this is terrible.

103
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,005

The dean is ready for you tramps.

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,641

Oh, jeez.

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,521

Ladies,

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,420

you have dragged the good name

107
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,251

of Barden University into the gutter.

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,482

And you've really upset these people

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,570

whose names I've already forgotten.

110
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,980

Your little southern exposure in front of our Commander-in-Chief

111
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,900

has irreparably damaged the entire institution of a cappella.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,060

Just blew it up.

113
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,083

Funding is drying up, sponsors are pulling out.

114
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,940

- Mmm-hmm. - Unfortunately, an example must be made.

115
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,220

It is the decision of this governing body

116
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,403

that the Bellas are hereby suspended

117
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,249

- from competing at the collegiate level. - What?

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,580

The terms of your suspension are laid out in this document.

119
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,940

- I'm sorry, but it's over. - Hi.

120
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,740

Okay, can we be reasonable?

121
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,260

Fat Amy apologized. This was an accident.

122
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,460

Was it?

123
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,847

You're taking us off of our victory tour?

124
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,460

Who's gonna sing the national anthem at the Puppy Bowl?

125
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,420

You're being replaced by the European champions.

126
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,100

A German group of total professionals.

127
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,100

In other words, they're gonna keep their pants on.

128
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,601

So we can't defend our title and we can't tour?

129
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,380

And you can't hold any auditions.

130
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,380

We don't need your ranks to grow like a fungus.

131
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,620

Oh, so that's it, then?

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,660

So, basically, the Bellas are over?

133
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,740

Look, ladies,

134
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,561

I'm sorry that this disciplinary action has shocked you.

135
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,540

Especially since you're all seniors.

136
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,940

But the truth is, you're just women.

137
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,280

No.

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,289

- And you'll all be pregnant soon. - Mmm.

139
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,220

Mom, I'm late.

140
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,561

It's orientation. You gotta let me go.

141
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,300

Oh, I can't.

142
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,420

I just can't do it.

143
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,460

Mom, you can do it.

144
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,530

My only daughter, leaving the nest.

145
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,411

If you leave me now

146
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,460

You'll take away the biggest part of me

147
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,060

- Mom. - You want me to stop?

148
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,420

Or I could keep singing!

149
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,788

No, I don't know how I'm

150
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,220

gonna get by without your spontaneous singing.

151
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,687

Oh, honey, you're gonna love this place.

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,845

Just promise you'll call.

153
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,209

Oh, and, honey, don't be afraid to express yourself.

154
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,891

And not with those weird buttons they wear in their earlobes.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,580

- Unless you're gonna get a job... - Mom, slow down.

156
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,460

I'm not gonna do anything crazy.

157
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,820

I'm just gonna write my songs and join an a cappella group.

158
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,446

Not just any a cappella group.

159
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,526

The Bellas are an institution.

160
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,020

My days as a Bella were the best...

161
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,620

Best days of your life.

162
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,371

I know. And I can't wait to be one.

163
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,820

Unless they don't take me, Mom.

164
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,060

Oh, no, honey, they're gonna take you.

165
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,640

Thanks to me, you were born into it.

166
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,530

And then I'm gonna be your mother...

167
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,286

And your sister

168
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,885

Gross. Okay.

169
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,806

All right, the next phase of my life

170
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,646

begins.

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,801

Hold on.

172
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,540

There is nothing in here that strips us of our national title.

173
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,380

And if we're still reigning champs,

174
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,860

then we are automatically invited to represent America

175
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,420

at the World Championships this spring.

176
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,060

Ah, yes, the World Championships of A Cappella,

177
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,460

where, every four years,

178
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,580

groups from around the globe compete for world domination.

179
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,260

I'm sorry. I just feel like I always have to be on, you know.

180
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,725

Yeah. Yeah. Well, look, ladies,

181
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,220

we can't stop you from going to the Worlds competition.

182
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,900

It's not gonna help your case here.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,020

Not at all.

184
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,220

What if we win it?

185
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,321

What if you win it?

186
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,900

Like, you...

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002

You out-perform the other groups?

188
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,060

How do you fit such big dreams in such a small body?

189
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,685

What if you win it?

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,100

Never.

191
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,123

What if you win it?

192
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,780

- Yeah. If we win, will you reinstate us? - Sure.

193
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,884

But no American team has ever won.

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,300

That's because they hate us.

195
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,765

The whole world.

196
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,100

The whole world hates us.

197
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,406

Hate us.

198
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,881

Hello, fresh-persons!

199
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,520

Welcome to Barden University!

200
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,140

Okay! The Barden Knight.

201
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,100

Okay, get off the stage. No one cares about you. All right.

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,761

You have made a great choice, and a cheap one.

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,568

Yay, Barden!

204
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,042

We have a very special performance for you guys today.

205
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,403

The pride and joy of Barden University,

206
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,483

the Treblamakers!

207
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,487

Thank you! Thank you, thank you.

208
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,620

We are the Treblemakers.

209
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,041

I'm Jesse, and this is a cappella.

210
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,766

Let's do this!

211
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,769

Hey yo, Trebles!

212
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,041

Someone drop some bass.

213
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,041

Now I need some baritone.

214
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,844

All right!

215
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,682

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

216
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,524

- Chloe, don't blame yourself. - Oh, my God!

217
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,842

You're a ginger. That's punishment enough.

218
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,608

This is not all your fault. This is on all of us.

219
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,860

So, if we don't win the Worlds, then what are we?

220
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,100

Just a bunch of girls that hang out?

221
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,420

What's wrong with that?

222
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,540

If we don't win, the Bellas are over.

223
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,500

This is the biggest challenge that any of us have ever faced.

224
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,363

When I was nine years old,

225
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,620

my brother tried to sell me for a chicken, so...

226
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,781

Well, I will do whoever it

227
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,620

takes in order for us to get back to the top.

228
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,820

You mean "Whatever" It takes.

229
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,206

Yeah, I'll do that, too.

230
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,700

That's great news. Yes.

231
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,460

No, I can start Monday. I would be stoked to start on...

232
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,700

Sorry, I don't say "Stoked." I don't say stuff like that.

233
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,087

I'm, like, I'm pretty cool. You're gonna like me.

234
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,660

That was bad, too.

235
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,140

We need to attack this problem head-on.

236
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,323

I want 100% commitment and laser focus, right?

237
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,721

Great! I will see you Monday.

238
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,241

Beca out!

239
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,620

- Beca. - Yeah.

240
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,245

Hey, ladies. Wanna come to a party?

241
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,140

It's a tiki party. You guys don't even have to wear shoes.

242
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,651

It's the best kind of party.

243
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,891

- Here you go. - Sure.

244
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,820

Hey, great job, Trebles. You guys killed it.

245
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,921

Oh, thank you.

246
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,844

- You like a cappella? - Oh, yeah.

247
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,322

I've got my heart set on being a Bella.

248
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,380

It's actually at the very top of all my dream boards.

249
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,660

Did I hear mention of dreams?

250
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,331

Hi. Benjamin Applebaum at your service. Hello.

251
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,770

I just have to say, you are so spirited. I...

252
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,127

I just wanna put you in a box and saw you in half.

253
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,681

For magic.

254
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,441

As a part of a trick. He does magic.

255
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,980

- Right. - It's only weird if you don't embrace it.

256
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,540

Dude, explain yourself.

257
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,860

I'll be honest, I completely blacked out. How'd I do, man?

258
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,580

Honestly? I've seen you do worse.

259
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,806

Awesome.

260
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,964

It's been months and we're still getting hate mail?

261
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,060

Sucks!

262
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,969

"For your hairy situation"?

263
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,367

Oh.

264
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,380

Okay, we are officially registered.

265
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,740

Update your passports, ladies, because we are going

266
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,767

to the very sunny, very beautiful, Copenhagen!

267
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,729

- Yeah! Nice! - Yes!

268
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,361

Oh.

269
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,220

Where is that?

270
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,970

I don't know. I failed Maps.

271
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,100

It looks like the competition has been dominated

272
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,220

by that stupid German group that took over our tour.

273
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,460

- You mean "Stole" Our tour. - Word.

274
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,340

We need to scout those Deutsche-bags.

275
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,441

Yes.

276
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,220

But how good can they be?

277
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,971

Germany hasn't produced a good singer since David Hasselhoff.

278
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,565

We're gonna crush them.

279
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,780

And when we do,

280
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,087

we can stick it to these

281
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:16,300

chumps who send us all this hate mail, like,

282
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,448

"Sonia Sotomayor."

283
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,370

Judgy bitch.

284
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,606

The Bellas are back!

285
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,446

- Yeah! Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! We're back.

286
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,660

Has anyone talked to Beca today?

287
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,740

So?

288
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,887

Any first-day jitters?

289
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,660

No, no. You know, I'm just gonna

290
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,460

be moody and distant. Artists love that.

291
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,561

I know I love that.

292
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,300

Here you go.

293
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,526

Okay.

294
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,420

Dude, why do I feel so guilty?

295
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,980

I've given a lot to the Bellas, right?

296
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,420

It's, like, three years of my life.

297
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,751

Yeah, Bec, you should not

298
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:46,820

feel guilty at all about taking your shot.

299
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,980

This is a big deal, right?

300
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,208

- Yes, it's a very big deal. - Okay.

301
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,724

- Go. - All right.

302
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,364

Nothing's gonna stop my girl!

303
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,740

I don't know him!

304
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,100

Becs in effects, y'all!

305
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,725

You can go!

306
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,041

Are you ready, or...

307
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,604

Okay, everybody, huddle up.

308
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,500

Let's go, let's go, let's go! Get up!

309
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,660

Come on! To the table, please! To the table!

310
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,500

Last one at this table has to help Frank watch YouTube videos

311
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,100

to find the next Justin Bieber.

312
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,820

Hey, so, I'm turning 25 next week,

313
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,922

if anybody wants to get some drinks, celebrate.

314
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,122

Frank, buddy, less talk.

315
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,820

Thank you so much.

316
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,002

Okay, my people, check it out.

317
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,491

That...

318
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,769

This... Dax, the tech guy. Did you call the tech guy?

319
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,180

Yeah, I talked to him.

320
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,443

Do you understand that everything else in my life works?

321
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,860

Uh-huh.

322
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,644

So, I just need everything here to work, too, okay?

323
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,848

- Well, he said he was gonna call me back. - Oh, my God.

324
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,801

You want me to call him now?

325
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,883

Don't do it now.

326
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,241

Okay.

327
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,801

There we go.

328
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,887

That is the Lion himself.

329
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,380

That is the legendary Snoop D-O-Double-G

330
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,100

singing White Christmas at a tree-lighting ceremony in Moscow.

331
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,260

And he was so moved by the power of music

332
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,020

to unite the world or some shit,

333
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,521

that now he wants to drop his own cool Christmas album.

334
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,808

And because I sleep on a bed of Grammys,

335
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,340

he has decided to hire me to produce it. Now...

336
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,420

But Snoop Dogg already dropped a Christmas album.

337
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,540

If you had listened to the album like I did,

338
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,770

stranded in the air with T.I. On a golden hang glider,

339
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,138

then you would have known

340
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,202

that none of the songs were the classics.

341
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,170

I've had to listen to that album on two separate occasions.

342
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,860

Hang glider with T. I.

343
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,486

And also a rocket ship that Eminem has built.

344
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,443

It doesn't go anywhere,

345
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,460

but he's got dreams for it, okay?

346
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,166

So I need you to close your mouth.

347
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,163

Herein lies the problem, everybody.

348
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,300

Last time I checked, there are over a million Christmas albums

349
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,926

with the same 10 damn songs on them.

350
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,764

So, guys, I'm telling you, man,

351
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,002

I need all hands on deck right now

352
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,180

to come up with ideas on how to make this one stand out.

353
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,725

Okay? You got it?

354
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,890

Fire when ready. I want to hear ideas.

355
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,680

Anything.

356
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,500

Anybody.

357
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,620

Anybody right now would be great.

358
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,260

- Anybody to talk... - What if we got those dogs...

359
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,850

Anybody but you.

360
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,900

What if we got those dogs that bark Jingle Bells to back him up?

361
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,620

And let me, let me, let me guess, let me guess.

362
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,900

You want those dogs to back him up because he's "Snoop Dogg"?

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,940

Yeah!

364
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,940

That is a really great example

365
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,804

of a horrible idea.

366
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,641

Take a lap.

367
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,500

- What? - Take a lap.

368
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,980

But I'm wearing skinny jeans.

369
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,060

I don't care.

370
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,420

Go. Go.

371
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,726

Let's go. I wanna see knees up.

372
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,891

Knees up, please.

373
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,860

Guys, I should give you a little more time.

374
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,860

A minute. You got one minute. 60 seconds.

375
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,500

My time is like a toddler in a tiara, okay? Precious and short.

376
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,490

I need really great ideas. Snoop is coming!

377
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,660

Oh. Sorry, my boobs are all crazy. I was just jumping.

378
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,020

I just came from auditions. You guys weren't there.

379
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,009

I was hoping for the chance to sing for you.

380
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,860

No, can't help you. We're not allowed to take anyone else new.

381
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,260

Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait!

382
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,940

I'm a Junk!

383
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,485

What'd you say about your junk?

384
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,645

I'm Emily Junk.

385
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,660

I know, it's weird. It's my mom's last name.

386
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,524

My dad's last name is Hardon, so...

387
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,361

Um...

388
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,766

I'm a Legacy.

389
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,326

Junk. Junk.

390
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,124

My mom was a Bella.

391
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,340

Your mother is Katherine Junk?

392
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,420

Who?

393
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,140

Only the top bitch of the 1981 Bellas.

394
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,447

She pioneered the syncopated booty shake.

395
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,961

And word is she has a five-octave vocal range.

396
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,121

Yep, still does.

397
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,180

You do not want to hear that woman doing it with my dad. Whew.

398
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,140

What an odd thing to say.

399
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,207

True.

400
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,641

If a Legacy wants to audition, we have to let her.

401
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,841

Okay, um...

402
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,860

Show us what you got.

403
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,645

Right now? Right here? Right here, right now.

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,047

Yeah.

405
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,050

Okay, um, I'd like to perform

406
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,380

an original song that I've been working on.

407
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,881

I'm not quite finished with it though,

408
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,845

so let's not be dicks about it.

409
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,580

Sorry, that was crass, wasn't it?

410
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,409

Fat Amy, you have a lovely vagina.

411
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,369

Thank you. Proceed.

412
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,004

When tomorrow comes I'll be on my own

413
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,245

Feeling frightened of the things that I don't know

414
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,366

When tomorrow comes When tomorrow comes

415
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,525

When tomorrow comes

416
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,082

And though the road is long I look up to the sky

417
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,740

Darkness all around...

418
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,665

No. That one, I'm not...

419
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,180

I'm still kind of tinkering with that verse.

420
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,521

So it's not... Nothing's really completely set.

421
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,571

I got all I need when I got you and I

422
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,883

'Cause I look around me and see a sweet life

423
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,771

I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight

424
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,367

You're getting me, getting me through the night

425
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,808

You are my flashlight

426
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,647

Would you excuse us for just one second?

427
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,900

She's pretty good. Can't we take her?

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,731

What do you expect us to say? She's standing right there.

429
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,620

- She's definitely not a soloist. - No.

430
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,965

Technically, she came to us,

431
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:53,700

so really we're not breaking any rules.

432
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,260

Yeah, it's the perfect loophole.

433
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,980

You know, it's always good to have an extra body.

434
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,500

Just in case one of us gets kidnapped for ransom,

435
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,140

is thrown into a shipping container,

436
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,180

and is made to eat only leaves and gas receipts.

437
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,460

Mmm, I agree. We need new blood.

438
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,927

I don't think we should decide anything without Beca.

439
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,288

I keep a penny under my tongue.

440
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,060

Did anyone else think it was creepy

441
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,140

that she never really opened her eyes the whole time?

442
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,060

Again, we're talking about her

443
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,900

- and she's standing right there. - Oh, yeah.

444
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,562

But if we're gonna talk negatives,

445
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:24,124

let's start with the giraffe legs.

446
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,660

Okay, let's take a vote on it.

447
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,260

Anyone who wants her in, sing a G-sharp.

448
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,700

Anyone who doesn't, sing an E-flat.

449
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,609

- Okay. - One, two...

450
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,126

I like your shirt.

451
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,340

Welcome to the Bellas!

452
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,523

O-M-a-ca-G! Whoo!

453
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,660

- Oh. Stop, girl, stop. - Yeah, stop, stop it.

454
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,285

- Girl, stop. - Sorry.

455
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,020

So, when does initiation start?

456
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,844

Tell you what, I'll go

457
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:58,260

back to my dorm and pretend to be surprised

458
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,124

when you throw the hood

459
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,620

over my head and make me solve a Rubik's Cube

460
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,290

while sucking vodka from a maxi pad.

461
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,020

That's what my mom said happened.

462
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,060

Mmm, no can do.

463
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,420

Well, look around.

464
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,940

We don't exactly have a maxi pad to spare, so...

465
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,220

All right, grab your guts, ladies! It's party time!

466
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,800

We've got tickets to Copenhagen and a brand new Bella!

467
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,765

- Let's go! - All right.

468
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,580

- Should I... - Come on, girl!

469
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,170

I'm gonna just leave my bag here.

470
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,488

Let's go get into treble!

471
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,300

Has this bush always been here?

472
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,460

Oh! Watch this.

473
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,686

You know there's a gate, right?

474
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,281

Wow.

475
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,323

My first college party.

476
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,000

Yeah, well, this isn't just any college party.

477
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,766

This is a cappella only! Yeah.

478
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,820

So, get prepared to meet a lot of sexually confused men.

479
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,380

Bellas! Welcome, welcome, welcome!

480
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,416

Jesse! Where is Beca?

481
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:54,380

I thought she was gonna be with you tonight.

482
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,881

I thought she was with you.

483
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,725

Hey! Benji, right?

484
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,444

Those aren't... Okay, those aren't words.

485
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,924

I'm sorry?

486
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,206

...the movies?

487
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,521

Are you asking me out?

488
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,041

- Yes. - Yeah?

489
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,249

Oh. That's so sweet.

490
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,770

It's just, my... It's my first day. Um...

491
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,601

I wasn't really planning on rushing in on anything.

492
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,060

- Hey! Oh. - Hey! You made it!

493
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,925

Yeah, I couldn't miss our last Hood Night party.

494
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,371

- Oh. - So?

495
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,460

How was the internship?

496
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,980

Eye-opening. Yeah, they do not mess around.

497
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,923

Hey, Chloe asked where you were.

498
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,526

Why didn't you tell her?

499
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,250

Oh. She's just...

500
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,109

She's locked into the Worlds

501
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,700

right now and I'm looking for the right time.

502
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,926

I'll tell her.

503
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,971

Bumper's back!

504
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,241

Whoo!

505
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,020

Campus security!

506
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,248

Bumper! Bumper!

507
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,260

Fat Amy's back!

508
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,860

'Cause I never left 'cause I'm still here.

509
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,192

Whoo! But I'm back, so

510
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:17,601

it's a big deal because I've arrived again!

511
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,460

You know, for someone who left school years ago,

512
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,164

you're harder to shake than mono.

513
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,260

I've got some pretty big news.

514
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,340

What?

515
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,060

I have been hand-plucked to be put on a waiting list

516
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,020

to be put on a very well-known TV singing competition.

517
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,100

- Really? - Yep.

518
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,220

I know what you're thinking.

519
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,380

"Oh, Bumper.

520
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,980

"You shut your face and kiss me, Bumper."

521
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,180

No.

522
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,420

"Bumper, please, just shut your trap."

523
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,780

That is not how I talk.

524
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,980

- You talk exactly like this. - Do not.

525
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,127

Yes, you do.

526
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,121

I don't.

527
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,370

- So shut up. - You shut up.

528
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,900

Hi!

529
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,980

Hi.

530
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,140

I am so excited to meet the woman

531
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,580

who single-handedly created the Bella sound.

532
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,841

We're sisters!

533
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,365

I can't believe we're sisters!

534
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,940

- Oh! Yeah, hi! - Hi!

535
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,460

Chloe texted me we added a Legacy.

536
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,005

I didn't even know that was a thing.

537
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,081

Shh.

538
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,780

Remind me again why we are at a car show.

539
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,460

We're here for one reason and one reason only.

540
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,740

To scout the competition.

541
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,813

It's totally gonna help us

542
00:27:10,814 --> 00:27:12,611

win the Worlds if we know what we're up against.

543
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,380

All right.

544
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,660

Now, where are those tour thieves?

545
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,761

Stacie!

546
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,780

Keep it in your pants, maybe.

547
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,405

- Stacie! - What?

548
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,565

What the...

549
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,322

This all should have been ours!

550
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,563

I hate these Germans.

551
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,009

Holy a-ca-mole!

552
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,300

Okay, the cars moved. Nothing else happened yet.

553
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,961

But they're moving backwards. With ghosts driving them.

554
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,380

We are Das Sound Machine.

555
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,147

A German collective,

556
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:51,900

operating in concert to create sonic mastery.

557
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,846

What better way to appreciate automotive perfection?

558
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,100

Man, they massive!

559
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,140

How are we gonna compete with a group that size?

560
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,651

They're so freakin' in sync.

561
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,500

Do we clap?

562
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,601

Do we clap? Do we clap?

563
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,721

Politely clap.

564
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,408

Barden Bellas. You came here to see us?

565
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,726

Is it because you are... What do the American kids say, "Jelly"?

566
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,247

We are so not "Jelly."

567
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,700

We should really thank you for making this tour a reality,

568
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,121

you know, with your bumbling ineptitude.

569
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,540

We should send them something. Fruit basket?

570
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,846

Yum, yum.

571
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,380

Or would you prefer mini-muffins?

572
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,820

Okay, we didn't come here to start something with you guys.

573
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,684

We just wanted to check you out before the Worlds,

574
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,165

where we're gonna kick your ass.

575
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,130

- What? - That's right.

576
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,086

You?

577
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,328

You are the kicker of ass?

578
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,321

Yeah.

579
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,324

You are so tiny.

580
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,641

Like an elf.

581
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,286

Or is it a fairy? Sprite?

582
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,940

"Troll."

583
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,122

That's it. You are like a troll.

584
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,801

You

585
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,620

are physically flawless.

586
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,660

Thank you.

587
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,967

But it doesn't mean I like you.

588
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,660

We are not scared about the Worlds,

589
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,420

because when the Bellas hit the stage, we are gonna blow minds.

590
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,500

With what?

591
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,300

More of Flabby Abby's baby chute?

592
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,540

That's not my name.

593
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,780

I don't know your name.

594
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,860

Could be anything.

595
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,726

Obese Denise, Inflexible Tina, Lazy Susan.

596
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,180

Mein name ist Fat Amy, und I eat krauts like you for lunch.

597
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,365

Your team is like a... How do you say that? A heated mess.

598
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,540

You know, a mess where heat is applied to it,

599
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,406

so what once was a little messy is now even messier.

600
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,128

Darlings, please take my advice.

601
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,020

Don't try to beat us.

602
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,380

You can't.

603
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,766

We're the best.

604
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,322

And now I really must go rest my neck.

605
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,928

It is sore from looking down on you.

606
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,041

Okay,

607
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,060

just because you're making me very sexually confused,

608
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,140

does not mean that you are intimidating.

609
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,980

We have nothing to lose.

610
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,060

- We have literally nothing! - Okay.

611
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,060

A-ca wiedersehen, bitches!

612
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,766

Oh, what is happening? I am using my hands so much.

613
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,765

All right, ladies, focus up.

614
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,740

We need to beat those German dummkopfs.

615
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,220

- Yes! - Yeah.

616
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,368

Okay, we're gonna beat DSM at their own game.

617
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,020

Do what they do, just better.

618
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,020

And we're about to do a full skills assessment

619
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,088

to blow out our choreography to match.

620
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,608

But the important thing is that we have fun, right?

621
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,580

Uh, Legacy, don't take this the wrong way,

622
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,489

but you're the dumbest person alive.

623
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,600

And you're a cat!

624
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,120

And one...

625
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,282

Okay, Lilly, that's really scaring me.

626
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,729

That just looks weird.

627
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,565

People are not birds.

628
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,010

Cartwheel. And roll! Amy, that wasn't a roll.

629
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,041

Again.

630
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,526

Is it weird that we never got around to singing today?

631
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,220

Uh, well, it's kind of hard to start singing

632
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,140

without arrangements, and that's on me.

633
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,651

So thank you for reminding me.

634
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,260

Yeah, Bec, we're gonna need that ASAP

635
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,900

so we can start nailing down our choreography.

636
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,660

- Right on top of that, Chlo. - Awes!

637
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,761

Yeah, awes.

638
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,367

So I just wanted to let

639
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:28,251

you know that I've been working really hard

640
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,780

on, you know, calming my nerves and keeping my eyes open.

641
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,340

I was wondering if you could give me some pointers, maybe.

642
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,380

And, you know, with the singing...

643
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,328

I don't know exactly where

644
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:36,700

you're gonna put me in the songs, but I...

645
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,644

I don't mean to be rude. I just have somewhere that I need to be.

646
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,820

Um...

647
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,020

You did great today.

648
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,121

Thanks.

649
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,762

Wait, hold up. Just hold up for a second.

650
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,206

"Wait, hold up"?

651
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,641

Man, I sound awesome right now. What are you talking about?

652
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,816

Nah! It's not you, it's a tech thing.

653
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:16,460

So just you go ahead and take five.

654
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,483

It better be a tech thing,

655
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,281

'cause the way I sound in my eardrums, this is immaculate, man.

656
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,847

This song, there's nothing, nothing special about it yet.

657
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,530

Do you know what I mean?

658
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,180

Any ideas? Because I...

659
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,420

All right, um, hear me out.

660
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,500

Please, Dax. Please...

661
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,860

We could remove the sleigh bells

662
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,486

and put in kalimba.

663
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,660

You know, the finger thing.

664
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,481

I know what a kalimba does. I know how it's operated, okay?

665
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,491

- Kalimba... - Don't say it again.

666
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,251

Go in the corner. Go eat your lunch in the corner.

667
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,420

But what am I gonna do with my sriracha?

668
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,060

Say one more hipster thing,

669
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,540

and I'm gonna shove you in your vintage bassoon case.

670
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,641

Okay?

671
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,801

Turn.

672
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,804

Aim higher, people. Okay?

673
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,700

And be very careful what you pitch to me next.

674
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,690

Um, just have him sing it again, the same way.

675
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,687

Who are you?

676
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,326

Nobody. Literally nobody. I just had a thought.

677
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,531

No, okay, okay.

678
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,041

Sure.

679
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,646

Nobody else has an idea.

680
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,802

Let's, uh, do it exactly the same way.

681
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,200

Again.

682
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,211

Will do, nephew.

683
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,260

Or it can be something different. It can...

684
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,600

Okay.

685
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,960

That was amazing, Snoop.

686
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,660

Thank you so very much.

687
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,100

You can take a small break, man.

688
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,680

Everything, perfection. Perfection.

689
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,809

Groovy like a drive-in movie.

690
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,720

You can sing.

691
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,964

Um, yeah, I'm a three-time collegiate a cappella champion, so...

692
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,700

We're both huge successes in our fields.

693
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,820

Yeah.

694
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,490

Yeah, let's say that.

695
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,165

Uh, what do you do here?

696
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,886

I just get coffee and burritos and stuff.

697
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,460

I wanna produce music.

698
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,380

Dax? Can you do me a favor?

699
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,051

Turn around right now, and watch this exchange.

700
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,005

That's "Value added." Okay?

701
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,228

If you have any demos you'd

702
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:25,851

like me to listen to, I'll make the time.

703
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,900

Oh, seriously?

704
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,340

- Mmm-hmm. Seriously, yeah. - Oh!

705
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,090

Dax, did you see what happened there?

706
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,260

- Uh-huh. - She did something that was helpful.

707
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,580

And now I'm going to reward her by listening to her demos.

708
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,806

Turn back around.

709
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,805

Now! Turn around, please.

710
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,580

So, Snoop, uh, buddy, we've got an idea.

711
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,700

Me, too.

712
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,940

Water skis, but for dry land.

713
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,460

Real playa. You know what I'm talking about?

714
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,641

Brilliant.

715
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,500

Fo shizzle, dizzle.

716
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,580

I'll write that down.

717
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,841

Yeah, please.

718
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,281

What am I looking at?

719
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,540

We're pillow fighting!

720
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,641

Aah!

721
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,860

You know this sets women back, like, 30 years?

722
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,580

We're just relieving some stress.

723
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,205

This was on the porch.

724
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,561

Ooh.

725
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,407

What is that? Looks fancy.

726
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,380

Looks like we've been invited to sing at some kind of a party.

727
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,527

We're going to sing?

728
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,780

Finally!

729
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,980

Well, there's just an address and a password.

730
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,889

- How sexy and mysterious. - Yeah.

731
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,449

Like how all my teeth are from other people.

732
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,681

Ow!

733
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,980

Anyone else scared?

734
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,845

Not really. I already lived longer than I expected.

735
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,967

Password.

736
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,926

Fart noise.

737
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,768

Did you not see the parentheses?

738
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,163

Bellas! I'm so glad you all came. Come on in.

739
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,700

Standing in front of you, ladies,

740
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,700

happens to be the world's biggest a cappella fan.

741
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,900

We found you!

742
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,060

Hello. Here I am.

743
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,660

What can we do for you?

744
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,380

So, last week when I was having a tinkle, it occurred to me...

745
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,891

Do not, do not!

746
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,761

Sorry.

747
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,980

That was rude.

748
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,209

You do not come to a gentleman's house and touch his goose.

749
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,322

So are we early, or...

750
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,451

Actually, you're pretty late. Come on, let's go!

751
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,008

This is the big time.

752
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,003

Das Sound Machine, two o'clock.

753
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,846

Tiny Mouse! We meet again.

754
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,843

Another verbal beatdown.

755
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,650

Highlight of my day.

756
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,456

So, have you abandoned

757
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:31,648

your foolish plans to face us at the Worlds?

758
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,966

You wish, you gorgeous specimen.

759
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,420

She's really in my head.

760
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,681

Very well.

761
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,047

I'll be happy to send you there.

762
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,531

I'll mail you.

763
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,887

Large envelope costs nothing.

764
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,883

Well, it will cost more than nothing.

765
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,942

But still cheaper than shipping,

766
00:40:49,943 --> 00:40:52,380

like, a horse, or perhaps an adult moose.

767
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,180

Did you ever think maybe you're too big?

768
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,060

- It would cost a fortune to mail you. - Easy.

769
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,491

You're enormous!

770
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,580

Okay.

771
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,900

I think we should change her name to "Feisty Mouse."

772
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,001

Yeah.

773
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,500

Just need to find, like, a taller pair of shoes.

774
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,601

- Wasn't a big deal. - Hey!

775
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,900

Hey! What are you doing here? What is going on?

776
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,740

- Welcome! - I guess I gotta go.

777
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,410

- No. Why? - I don't know.

778
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,540

Welcome to the first ever showdown

779
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:22,569

of the National A Cappella Laser Ninja Dragon League!

780
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,923

Can you dig it?

781
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,402

Okay, let's meet our teams.

782
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,220

First we have The Treblemakers!

783
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,890

Yeah!

784
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,369

Okay. We have the Barden Bellas.

785
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,250

We have the Tone Hangers!

786
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,365

- Sorbet - Sorbet

787
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,170

- Sorbet - Sorbet

788
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,046

And a cherry on top

789
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,580

And taking a break from their national tour,

790
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,500

Das Sound Machine!

791
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,660

- DSM! - Ja!

792
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,780

- DSM! - Ja!

793
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,291

- DSM! - Ja!

794
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,924

And the pride of Wisconsin, the Green Bay Packers!

795
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,124

Let's go! Here we go, baby!

796
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,568

- Let's go! - What?

797
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,967

I'd like to be the brisket in that man-sandwich.

798
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,804

Well, here's how this is gonna work.

799
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,089

When I point to you, you sing a song

800
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,166

from one of the categories

801
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,806

that's gonna appear up there on the big board.

802
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,540

There's only one rule.

803
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,291

You have to meet the beat. Here, come here.

804
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,806

But you have to do it "Follow the Leader" Style.

805
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,900

Oh, boy!

806
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,525

Oh, goodness.

807
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,130

That was fun.

808
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,840

Now, if you can't carry the tune, the whole team's out.

809
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,322

As in, you gone! And then...

810
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,211

Cornelius, this is too heavy. I told you before.

811
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,522

Because I hurt my arm saluting the flag.

812
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,841

Okay, sorry.

813
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,487

Now, the winners will get

814
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,691

epic bragging rights!

815
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,820

- What? - That's it?

816
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,729

Oh. And I'm sorry. Did I not mention this?

817
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,561

A $42,000 gift card to Dave and Buster's!

818
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,889

I was going there anyway. I was going there anyway.

819
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,282

I know Clay Matthews wants it.

820
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,580

Okay. All right, let's get this thing started.

821
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,648

Let's take a look at the first category.

822
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,005

Ooh. Songs about butts.

823
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,441

Okay.

824
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,700

- Anything on the radio, basically, right? - Right.

825
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,484

Think about what you're gonna sing.

826
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,843

Let's start with Das Sound Machine!

827
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,540

Girl, I love that butt

828
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,540

But the butt's not what matters You know what does?

829
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,540

Courtship and chivalry I'll take you to a nice hot meal

830
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,165

And I'll tip the waiter

831
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,163

Oh, my God, stop! Stop!

832
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,004

What was that, yo?

833
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,807

Not how we play the game.

834
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,369

You think you're a better lyricist than Sir Mix-a-Lot,

835
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,300

a man who was knighted by Queen?

836
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,402

- You know the band Queen? - Yes.

837
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,620

No, sir, I do not. I just... I couldn't help it.

838
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,722

I caught a glimpse of an angel.

839
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,140

I got inspired.

840
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,740

Well, you're going to hell.

841
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,491

Because, Treblemakers, you gone!

842
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,723

You gone!

843
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,247

- Bye-bye. - Sorry.

844
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,004

Sorry. I'm sorry.

845
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,380

Four left.

846
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,086

Let's take a look at the next category!

847
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,060

Oh. Country love!

848
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,180

Oh! Oh, oh! I am all about this!

849
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,300

Nobody in this room has loved more tender than I have.

850
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,380

Please pick us.

851
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,540

Let me have it.

852
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,220

- Let us have it. Let the world have it. - Yeah!

853
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,540

I would give it to him.

854
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,700

All right, then. Well, why don't we start with you?

855
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,380

Tone Hangers, you're up. You're up.

856
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,420

What?

857
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,887

All right, I got this. I got this. I got this.

858
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,620

This is my jam!

859
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,980

How about them Cowboys?

860
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,606

Come on, man.

861
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,125

- I got nothing. - Come on!

862
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,660

God damn it! I got nothing, guys!

863
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,091

What?

864
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,700

- I'm sorry. - You blew it.

865
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,540

Man, you are such a dis-a-ca-pointment.

866
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,580

Reginald Wilson Moncrieff Matthews IV,

867
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,286

what on God's green one are you doing?

868
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,126

I had my mind on those 42 G's at D and B's.

869
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,886

- I'm afraid you've kissed that goodbye. - No!

870
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,690

- Green Bay Packers... - No, no, no!

871
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,211

- ...you gone! - No!

872
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,447

Let's see what the next category is!

873
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,441

Oh.

874
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,161

Yes! Oh!

875
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,280

Oh, I was his personal assistant!

876
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,540

- Unfair! - Come on.

877
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,940

- Yes, yep. - We got this.

878
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,451

Yeah, we got this. Get in there.

879
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,762

Okay, then why don't we start with you, Das Sound Machine?

880
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,528

Is that John Mayer?

881
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,691

That doesn't deserve a "Boo."

882
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,610

I killed that!

883
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,884

Explain for everyone,

884
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,122

because it sounds like you're implying

885
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,180

that John Mayer and Tina Turner are having...

886
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,281

Oh, yeah.

887
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,369

Get them out! Get them out!

888
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,980

I don't know if I believe him.

889
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,241

I'm telling the truth!

890
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,691

Tone Hangers,

891
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,721

you gone!

892
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,403

Two! We have our final two!

893
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,682

Now we have a showdown!

894
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,245

All right, come on in.

895
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,846

Let's do this face-off style. Okay.

896
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,890

Let's take a look, see what your final category is.

897
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,882

'90s hip-hop jams!

898
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,560

Okay, y'all, take a second to think about it.

899
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,166

Time's up! Go!

900
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,763

I got all I need when I got you and I

901
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,287

'Cause I look around me and see a sweet life

902
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,780

I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight

903
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,860

What?

904
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,486

You're getting me, getting me through the night

905
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,609

I'm sorry.

906
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,290

What '90s hip-hop jam is that again?

907
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,441

Um...

908
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,002

More like a 21 st century jam.

909
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,481

That's it. Yeah. I wrote it.

910
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,845

Just stay calm.

911
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,248

You're saying it's an original?

912
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,044

Yes, I'm saying it's an original.

913
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,362

Boo!

914
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,610

Go home, little girl!

915
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,645

Our jam is covers!

916
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,290

We spit on originals!

917
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,604

What is your name?

918
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,081

Emily.

919
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,765

I hate you.

920
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,810

In light of this embarrassing

921
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,967

and unprofessional information,

922
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,100

I am forced to declare...

923
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,140

I'm sorry, guys.

924
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,926

- ...Das Sound Machine is the winner! - Yeah!

925
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,321

Whoo!

926
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,284

Yeah! Yeah!

927
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,761

Oh.

928
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,740

Hey, did you really write that?

929
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,700

You shouldn't have done that, Emily.

930
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,820

Now DSM thinks that they have the drop on us.

931
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,140

I'm sorry. I panicked.

932
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,580

I understand if you want me to crawl under a rock and die.

933
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,780

Hey, we don't want...

934
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,041

Hey, we don't want that.

935
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,660

Hey, Becs,

936
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,410

- let's go meet the Green Bay Packers. - Okay.

937
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,721

Whew.

938
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,320

Boo!

939
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,540

I'm just kidding. Would you like to have sex later?

940
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,721

No!

941
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,580

So that's a "No," Then?

942
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,205

Because with the wink, and that's what...

943
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,810

It's 100% no!

944
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,600

I want it! Give me!

945
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,620

Dax. I swear, if this kid was not my nephew...

946
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,180

Hey, I know you're crazy busy,

947
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,820

but have you had a chance to check out those demos?

948
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,844

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I did.

949
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,521

This dead air between us is a good sign.

950
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,485

Look,

951
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,980

you got a great ear,

952
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,300

you proved that in the booth,

953
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,340

and I was super excited to hear what else you had

954
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,649

and what you gave me was more mash-ups.

955
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,689

That's sort of what I do.

956
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,162

Listen, Reggie. Is it "Reggie"?

957
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,970

"Beca."

958
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,300

Um, that happens a lot, though. You'd be surprised.

959
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,380

Okay.

960
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,860

Here's the thing.

961
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,740

Um, any kid with ears and a laptop can do that.

962
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,365

Dax can do that.

963
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,580

- All right? - Right.

964
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,140

So that's fine if you want a career

965
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,820

deejaying raves out in the desert.

966
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,030

But if you want to write

967
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:18,020

"Music producer" On your tax forms someday,

968
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,100

then you've gotta have an original voice. Do you understand?

969
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,300

You've gotta show me what you have.

970
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,060

Right now, what I have is a demo with mash-ups on it.

971
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,241

Yeah, yeah.

972
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,660

I got lots of stuff to say. I'm just saving it all up.

973
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,807

Look...

974
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,121

Uh...

975
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,060

- What is it? "Beca"? - Beca.

976
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,161

Okay, yeah.

977
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,660

So, you're an intern,

978
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,660

and everybody else in here is an intern.

979
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,923

You're talented, everybody else in here is talented.

980
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,340

So what the hell makes you special? Do you know what I mean?

981
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,900

That's good.

982
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,780

So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you one more shot

983
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,060

to show me who you are as an artist. Okay?

984
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,571

Do not waste it.

985
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,882

No, sir, will not waste it.

986
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,100

I really hope you don't, for your sake.

987
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,380

'Cause I would hate to think

988
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,801

that singing covers in an a cappella group is all you can do.

989
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,885

Please replace the paper towels.

990
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,760

Hey, it's Jesse. Text me.

991
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,889

Hey, it's me. Um...

992
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,802

Hey, so you might not be able to hear this message,

993
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,003

because, it turns out, I have nothing to say.

994
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,080

Um...

995
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,170

That's music industry speak for "I suck."

996
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,609

You're definitely asleep right now.

997
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,849

That's cool.

998
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,050

Text me when you're up.

999
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,241

Hey.

1000
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,567

What?

1001
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,088

A girl can't say she's going

1002
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:58,288

to grab a smoothie and return 14 hours later?

1003
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,169

There's nothing suspicious about that.

1004
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,531

Why are you up so late anyways?

1005
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,681

Um, I was just figuring some stuff out.

1006
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,370

You're working on the set?

1007
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,801

Um...

1008
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,460

I'm not working on the set. I'm just, like...

1009
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,607

What?

1010
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,208

Nothing. Doesn't matter.

1011
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,564

If you did wanna share something with me,

1012
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,171

your best friend,

1013
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,448

I'm a great keeper of secrets.

1014
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,443

I'm like a safe that locks,

1015
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,321

with a key,

1016
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,529

and the key is stashed up my bum. Because...

1017
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,842

It's fine. Forget it. It's all good.

1018
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,165

So this has nothing to do

1019
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:43,100

with that internship that you sneak off to?

1020
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,531

What?

1021
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,440

- Um... - Come on, Beca.

1022
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,500

You know how we do that thing every month

1023
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,809

where I take $20 out of your purse and you pretend not to notice?

1024
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,327

I saw your ID badge in your bag.

1025
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,045

Don't be mad.

1026
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,964

I'm not mad, actually.

1027
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,566

About the badge.

1028
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,882

The money, I wanna come back to.

1029
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,001

Shh.

1030
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,647

Let's just focus on your lie.

1031
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,161

Beca,

1032
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,010

why didn't you tell us?

1033
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,525

Or at least Chloe.

1034
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,650

I don't know. Just... 'Cause it's just easier.

1035
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,460

There's, like, so much going on, and Chloe would lose her mind

1036
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,848

if she thought my sole focus wasn't winning Worlds.

1037
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,883

Sorry, it's just now I'm freaking out,

1038
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,220

because it turns out, like, I'm totally

1039
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,180

not good enough to be a music producer.

1040
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,602

Which is cool and fun to know as I enter the rest of my life.

1041
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,451

Okay, I'm just gonna stop you right there.

1042
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,900

You're the most talented person that I know,

1043
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,002

and I've met three of The Wiggles.

1044
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,726

Intimately.

1045
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,100

Oh.

1046
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,965

Beca, do you know how awesome you are?

1047
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,924

You're Beca effing Mitchell.

1048
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,140

Okay?

1049
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,685

You're "The Big B.M."

1050
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,940

That's you.

1051
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,280

And you're awesome!

1052
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,300

Do you need some of my confidence?

1053
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,323

'Cause I could maybe tone mine down a notch.

1054
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,460

Yeah, okay.

1055
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,562

Then let me rub some out.

1056
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,300

Oh, okay.

1057
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,460

Wait. Think you need a bit more.

1058
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,641

It comes from there?

1059
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,260

- Okay. Thank you. - You just need that.

1060
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,180

I'm gonna get you the good stuff now.

1061
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,460

No, I don't want butt confidence.

1062
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,140

I don't want your butt confidence!

1063
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,366

No! I have enough!

1064
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,244

I have enough! I have enough!

1065
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,280

I believe in you, Beca.

1066
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,450

Come on.

1067
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,366

Whoa. Candles, cloth napkins,

1068
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,611

- foods other than salsa. - Yep.

1069
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,860

This is a little classier than our typical hook-ups.

1070
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,580

Is it? Huh.

1071
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,860

I have a patisserie,

1072
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,740

some charcuterie,

1073
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,740

and a huge bowl of exotic capers.

1074
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,923

I didn't know what those were, but they're like salty peas.

1075
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,885

So,

1076
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,520

I don't know if you've seen the news lately,

1077
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,251

but there's a war.

1078
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,563

And also, the economy

1079
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,411

is dipping and ebbing and flowing.

1080
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,684

Bumper, what's going on?

1081
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,564

Now you're kind of creeping me out.

1082
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,087

Okay, I guess I'll just lay it all out there.

1083
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,364

The reason that I brought you here tonight

1084
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,648

was because I was thinking that

1085
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,326

maybe, perhaps,

1086
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,204

if you're interested...

1087
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,843

This is harder than I thought it was gonna be.

1088
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,405

I wanna date you.

1089
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,085

That's what I want.

1090
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,285

Like for real. Like a real couple.

1091
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,940

Where we, like, go out in public and hold hands

1092
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,220

and ride bikes together.

1093
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,688

Or we, like, go to an orchard and pick apples.

1094
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,580

Or we, like, do one of those, like,

1095
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,220

Build-A-Bear Workshops together,

1096
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,540

and we build bears,

1097
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,980

and you name one "Bumper" And I'll name one "Fat Amy,"

1098
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,900

and yours will be bigger than mine and it'll be cute,

1099
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,083

and we can put them on our bed that we share.

1100
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,444

What do you say?

1101
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,246

No.

1102
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,606

I don't...

1103
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,206

I don't do that.

1104
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,530

Yeah, that's cool.

1105
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,940

- It was a... - Cool.

1106
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,300

- It was a stupid idea anyways. - Yeah.

1107
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,324

Obviously, we shouldn't do that. We should just

1108
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,527

go back to how things used to be

1109
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,687

and just go at it on top

1110
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:50,340

of all this expensive food that I bought.

1111
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,566

Are you crying?

1112
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,540

Nope.

1113
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,721

No, I'm not.

1114
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,841

Bumper!

1115
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,162

Come on, you can't be serious.

1116
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,020

I can't be tied down by anything.

1117
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,260

I'm on a walkabout.

1118
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,284

I'm a free-range pony that can't be tamed.

1119
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,161

You know.

1120
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,209

- Okay. - I'm like a firework.

1121
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,530

- I can't be tied down. - Okay.

1122
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,842

Then that's it. Then I guess that's it, right?

1123
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,731

Because I'm not gonna keep going on like this.

1124
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,285

- Well... - Fine.

1125
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,940

Fine, if that's how you feel, then I think we're done.

1126
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,166

I think it's over.

1127
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,010

- That's it? - That's it, then.

1128
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,620

So it's over, then.

1129
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,926

Fine. Then it's over.

1130
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,241

Fine, then.

1131
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,001

No!

1132
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,288

Too late. You're too late!

1133
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,900

I figured when we didn't do the serenade,

1134
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,420

the back-up plan should be to play her off.

1135
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,646

Turn around. Go back.

1136
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,410

I don't wanna hear another peep!

1137
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,770

Trebles for life

1138
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,331

- Benji! - I'm sorry.

1139
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,608

Hey, guys, it's my first performance.

1140
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,604

Calm down. It's just a chance for us to rehearse for Worlds.

1141
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,331

As far as I can tell, it's just for a bunch of old people.

1142
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,364

There's a full house out there.

1143
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,090

How did we get this gig again?

1144
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,526

They called us.

1145
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,681

You know what, guys?

1146
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,157

I know we're trying a lot of new stuff,

1147
01:02:26,158 --> 01:02:27,500

but I feel like we're gonna get out there

1148
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,651

and we're gonna feel the

1149
01:02:28,652 --> 01:02:30,580

energy and we are just gonna nail all of it!

1150
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,060

Sorry, these braids are so tight.

1151
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,060

You know what? I don't know. I don't know.

1152
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,620

I have many, many doubts,

1153
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,980

because if we fail this, then we won't win the Worlds,

1154
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,780

and if we don't win the Worlds, there will be no more Bellas,

1155
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,881

and without the Bellas,

1156
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,844

then my life would have had no...

1157
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,411

"Malaria."

1158
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,322

"Meaning," Flo.

1159
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,481

Three, two...

1160
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,180

Hey, everybody. Welcome back to Let's Talk-Appella,

1161
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,260

the portable podcast edition.

1162
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,860

We are following the story of the embattled Barden Bellas

1163
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,724

on their road to redemption.

1164
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,844

Trying to crawl their way back into the public's affection.

1165
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,606

And if they can just hold off

1166
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,522

showing us any more of their genitalia,

1167
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,847

they may make it to the World Championship.

1168
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,260

Well, I can't un-see it.

1169
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,860

It's haunted me ever since.

1170
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,060

Well, there's a picture of it right here.

1171
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,128

No. This should not be your screensaver, John.

1172
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,923

Stepping onto the stage, the Barden Bellas.

1173
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,365

- Whoa! - All right!

1174
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,648

- This is some exciting stuff. - So sassy!

1175
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,540

Wow. A lot going on up there.

1176
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,900

I think this sounds good.

1177
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,321

Honestly, my senses are overwhelmed here, John.

1178
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,202

They might wanna tone down the theatrics.

1179
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,646

Let's hope there are no props.

1180
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,660

Oh, they brought the props out, John.

1181
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,700

And there are the props.

1182
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,020

This is more of a circus act than an a cappella performance.

1183
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,700

Gail, it's as if the Barden Bellas

1184
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,325

just don't know who they are anymore.

1185
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,483

Whoa!

1186
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,766

Look at this!

1187
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,809

She's on fire! She's on fire!

1188
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,380

- Oh, my God! I'm on fire! - Now they lit one on fire.

1189
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,500

- Good day! Good heavens! - Oh.

1190
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,364

- Incoming! - Oh, my God, I can't breathe!

1191
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,568

I can't breathe, girl! Fat Amy, I can't breathe!

1192
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,820

Beating DSM seems impossible for this team.

1193
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,900

Even these common people can see

1194
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,660

that the Barden Bellas have no shot at reinstatement.

1195
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,410

They are an embarrassment

1196
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,660

to a cappella and all that it stands for.

1197
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,321

This is what happens when you send girls to college.

1198
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,081

Is it?

1199
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,084

Is that for a class?

1200
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,890

No, it's just when I get stressed,

1201
01:05:41,891 --> 01:05:43,300

words sort of flow right out of me

1202
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,845

and I try and channel them in my songwriting...

1203
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,860

Are we just gonna ignore what happened back there?

1204
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,940

Guys, hello?

1205
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,724

The Worlds are right around the corner

1206
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,712

and you guys are acting

1207
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:53,420

like we didn't just eat a big bag of... Ahhh!

1208
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,601

Why are you yelling at me?

1209
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,020

I almost burned to death because of you a-ca-bitches.

1210
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,069

If you almost died, it was

1211
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:59,860

only because you were standing in the wrong spot.

1212
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,620

No! Flo flipped into me!

1213
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,768

Sure. Blame the minority.

1214
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,651

I'm black, gay, and a woman.

1215
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,802

I'm not pointing the finger at anybody.

1216
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,200

It was Legacy's fault.

1217
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,460

Me? Wait, I didn't...

1218
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,006

Obviously, we're not gonna beat Das Sound Machine at their game.

1219
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,561

So we need a new plan. Like, now.

1220
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,601

At times like these, there's only one thing for us to do.

1221
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,684

- Fake your own death and flee the country. - Close.

1222
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,730

We're going on a retreat.

1223
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,806

Look, I think the retreat will be a good thing.

1224
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,645

You girls need to bond heading into Worlds.

1225
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,820

It'll be so much fun.

1226
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,100

I don't know. No, Mom, it's bad. It's...

1227
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,646

- The girls are yelling at each other. - Oh, big deal.

1228
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,580

I remember putting your godmother,

1229
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,409

Maggie Pistol, in a choke hold,

1230
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,727

because she insisted that George Michael was gay.

1231
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,850

- Who? - Oh.

1232
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,460

I'm just worried that my entire Bella career

1233
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,767

will be that one terrible performance.

1234
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,009

And I'll never get to solo at Lincoln Center, you know?

1235
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,850

But you're gonna get to go to Europe.

1236
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,930

That would have been the highlight of my college career.

1237
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,610

And you girls can win it.

1238
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,125

You have to win it.

1239
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,011

You just made being a Bella sound so amazing.

1240
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,770

And it is amazing.

1241
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,290

It's a sisterhood that is

1242
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:14,561

gonna support you for the rest of your life.

1243
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,604

I know you're not feeling it,

1244
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,006

but you will.

1245
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,726

This won't be the end of the Bellas.

1246
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,211

Hey, Benji.

1247
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,481

Emily!

1248
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,601

- Listen, I think you're missing a word here. - What's that?

1249
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,300

Oh, God. No. That's not... That isn't what I meant. I just...

1250
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,380

I didn't think so.

1251
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,820

- That's really embarrassing. - No, it looks...

1252
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,940

Syntax is usually my forte,

1253
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,660

- so I don't know how that happened. - Well, it looks great.

1254
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,330

Thank you. That's really sweet...

1255
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,681

Um...

1256
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,681

When my hands aren't covered in glitter paint,

1257
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,087

do you think maybe we could try that again?

1258
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,924

Yeah. Sure.

1259
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,651

All right. Okay. Well...

1260
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,369

I'll look forward to that.

1261
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,561

Just, you know,

1262
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,580

- let me know when they're clean. - That's...

1263
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,740

- I will. - All right.

1264
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,900

- You bet. - Okay.

1265
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,684

All right. Have a good one.

1266
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,009

Okay, girls! Everyone, in the bus.

1267
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,060

Go, go, go!

1268
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,220

- Let's go. - Okay.

1269
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,420

Seatbelts!

1270
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,244

Good luck, Benji!

1271
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,487

This place is sweet!

1272
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,401

It's nice, right?

1273
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,329

I need to find somewhere to charge my laptop.

1274
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,321

How'd you hear about this place?

1275
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,010

From yours truly.

1276
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,687

Hello, Bellas.

1277
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,046

Aubrey!

1278
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,367

- Aubrey! - Aubrey!

1279
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,780

Okay, girls.

1280
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,211

Oh, wow. Hi! You must be Emily.

1281
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,540

- Hey, hey. - Hey. Hi.

1282
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,380

Welcome to The Lodge at Fallen Leaves,

1283
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,180

where Fortune 500 companies send

1284
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,964

their employees to build teamwork skills.

1285
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,804

You run this whole place?

1286
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,315

You know, I realized I had a

1287
01:09:15,316 --> 01:09:17,420

knack for barking orders and bending people's will.

1288
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,602

So I made a career out of it.

1289
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,220

Which reminds me,

1290
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,980

fall in line, Bellas!

1291
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,100

She ain't changed.

1292
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,140

No slouching! No straggling!

1293
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,083

I see you, Jessica.

1294
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:33,485

It is with great sorrow and regret

1295
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,691

that I had to watch our once proud organization

1296
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,923

become a national disgrace!

1297
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,460

Can I have the keys to the minibar?

1298
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,005

Zip it.

1299
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,367

The Worlds signifies a shot at redemption.

1300
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,990

You don't have a chance

1301
01:09:51,991 --> 01:09:54,441

at winning until you find your sound again.

1302
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,251

You have totally lost your harmony!

1303
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,051

So, for the next two days,

1304
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,886

you will be doing everything together until you regain it.

1305
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,164

Ladies, get ready to be transformed.

1306
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,088

You are surrounded with the strength of your fellow Bellas

1307
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,201

and the support of a proud female tradition.

1308
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,220

And a few dozen bear traps.

1309
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,651

So don't stray too far from the marked paths.

1310
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,860

- Okay, great, let's go! - All right.

1311
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,460

Well, maybe I'll just start with a hot shower,

1312
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,766

maybe a little foot rub.

1313
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,764

Fat Amy, there are no guest rooms for you.

1314
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,928

Then where are we staying?

1315
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,650

I don't understand camping.

1316
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,121

We're voluntarily living like dogs.

1317
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,406

This is the worst.

1318
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,325

The air we're breathing right now is at least 90% fart.

1319
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,340

That reminds me,

1320
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,283

I need to see a man about a horse.

1321
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,921

Oh!

1322
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,805

Did anyone happen to pack a spare roll of toilet paper?

1323
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,685

- Or a moist towelette? - Nope.

1324
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,289

Anyone have a T-shirt, size extra-small?

1325
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,366

Okay. Side of the tent it is.

1326
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,020

What are we doing here?

1327
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,220

We're bonding.

1328
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,260

You seem so tense. Do you need a back rub?

1329
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,580

Several body parts are rubbing my back right now, thank you.

1330
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,100

You know, Beca, we're very close,

1331
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,860

but I feel like this retreat is really gonna let us

1332
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,580

discover everything about each other.

1333
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,681

Is that right?

1334
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,500

You know, one of my biggest regrets

1335
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,331

is that I didn't do enough experimenting in college.

1336
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,020

You're so weird.

1337
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,201

Thanks.

1338
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,846

I wanna go home.

1339
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,807

I hope the sun never comes up.

1340
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,327

Why do I get the travel pillow?

1341
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,570

Were you touching my goodies?

1342
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,841

Yes.

1343
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,167

Oh, guys, I've got a little... It won't...

1344
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,482

I just need some help getting it out.

1345
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,244

Can you sing something?

1346
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,249

The pipe's a bit blocked.

1347
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,721

Thanks, Chloe.

1348
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,209

What kind of white shit is this?

1349
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,321

Coming out like froyo now.

1350
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,851

Up and at 'em, Bellas! Come on! Let's go!

1351
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,526

Let's go! Let's wake up! Let's do this!

1352
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,284

Come on! Pick up the pace, girls!

1353
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,441

Come on!

1354
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,980

Today we are going back to the basics

1355
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,500

to re-learn how to sing as a group,

1356
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,809

while also enduring death-defying team-building trust exercises.

1357
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,126

What a great idea!

1358
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,402

Okay, so let's begin.

1359
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,140

Come on.

1360
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,441

Trust your team!

1361
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,967

- Careful, Fat Amy! - Turn me over!

1362
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,121

Come on, lunch!

1363
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,209

She says she's Asian Jesus.

1364
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,881

Great.

1365
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,567

Okay, that was two steps away from being almost fine.

1366
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,006

Sorry, what are we doing?

1367
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,100

We're rediscovering our sound.

1368
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,201

Are we?

1369
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,480

'Cause it feels like we're

1370
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:36,251

just singing songs that would never go in our set.

1371
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,380

Beca, come on.

1372
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,050

No, none of us know how to beat Das Sound Machine,

1373
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,969

but I know it's not gonna be by doing this.

1374
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,890

This is just an exercise in finding harmony, Beca.

1375
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,986

Sometimes you have to break

1376
01:14:44,987 --> 01:14:46,887

things down before you can build them back up again.

1377
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,140

I've got more important things to do!

1378
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,820

What could be more important than this?

1379
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,206

Nothing. Forget it.

1380
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,300

No, you don't think that we haven't all realized

1381
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,980

you've been a little checked-out lately?

1382
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,525

Come on, Beca, just tell her.

1383
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,921

I heard that.

1384
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,161

Tell me what?

1385
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,922

Oh, you misunderstood me. I clearly said...

1386
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,500

Listen, I don't want you guys to fight.

1387
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,340

You're Beca and Chloe. Together you're "Bloe."

1388
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,044

And everyone loves a good bloe.

1389
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,820

So...

1390
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,160

Okay.

1391
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,340

I've been interning at a recording studio

1392
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,980

and a legit music producer wants to hear my work.

1393
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,100

God forbid I have something going on outside this group.

1394
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,201

Okay.

1395
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,140

So why would you keep something like that from us?

1396
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,049

'Cause you're obsessed! You all are.

1397
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,482

We're graduating, and the only

1398
01:15:28,483 --> 01:15:30,620

person thinking about life after the Bellas is me.

1399
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,121

What is so wrong with being focused on the Bellas?

1400
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,601

This has been my family for seven years.

1401
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,420

Yeah, 'cause you're too scared to leave!

1402
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,700

Sack up, dude!

1403
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,020

Girl fight!

1404
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,420

Okay, so you've been lying to us for the entire year

1405
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,521

and now you're just gonna flake out?

1406
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,271

Now you're gonna flake out when the Worlds is,

1407
01:15:45,272 --> 01:15:46,300

like, right after graduation?

1408
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,780

Oh, my God! Enough about the Worlds! I...

1409
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,140

I'm out of here.

1410
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,540

Oh, okay, you're just gonna leave now?

1411
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,700

We all have to, eventually, Chloe!

1412
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,380

It might as well be now!

1413
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,500

Wait, Beca...

1414
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,060

If you all knew what was good for you, you'd follow me.

1415
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,446

Beca, the sign!

1416
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,540

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1417
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,660

Oh, no, Beca! Beca!

1418
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,700

What the hell? I'm stuck!

1419
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,820

I'm stuck! I'm seeing spots! I'm seeing spots!

1420
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,700

Well, well, well.

1421
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,220

Look who needs our help.

1422
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,700

Not cool, guys!

1423
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,220

No, what's not cool is you taking out your frustrations on us!

1424
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,220

Really? That's what you're gonna say to me right now?

1425
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,482

Help me! I'm dying! I'm dying!

1426
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,241

We need to get her down! We need a ladder!

1427
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,700

- No, we don't believe in ladders. - What?

1428
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,180

They suggest a corporate hierarchy

1429
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,408

that is counter-productive to my team-building program.

1430
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,380

What kind of operation are you running here?

1431
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,380

Seriously, this whole place is, like, full of booby traps!

1432
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,580

And guess what?

1433
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,967

Boobs should never be trapped!

1434
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,846

Unless it's for support if you have lower back issues.

1435
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,580

Okay! If I'm about to die, I'm sorry!

1436
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,260

I didn't mean any of that stuff I said!

1437
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,100

I love all of you! I love all of you awesome nerds,

1438
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,567

and I love being a Bella. I'm just so stressed out right now...

1439
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,580

- Oh, my God! - Oh, my gosh!

1440
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,800

Jessica and Ashley, I don't

1441
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:55,460

actually know which one of you is which.

1442
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,100

- I'm Jessica! - I'm Jessica!

1443
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,460

Don't worry, we're gonna get you down! Focus up.

1444
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,260

- Get in formation, we can do this. Flo, get up. - Okay.

1445
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,566

- Fat Amy, come on! - Yes!

1446
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,780

Let's focus. Work together as a team.

1447
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,006

Don't worry, Beca, we got...

1448
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,606

She's alive.

1449
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,409

I sleep upside down like a bat.

1450
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,420

It's just everything's changing so fast

1451
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,060

and I'm putting all this pressure on myself, you know?

1452
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,700

I don't wanna fail.

1453
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,500

But if you just would have said something...

1454
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,260

Yeah, I know. But I'm weird about that stuff.

1455
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,284

I thought I could figure it out on my own, and I can't.

1456
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,646

Maybe I don't have anything original to say.

1457
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,488

I wish I could do what you do.

1458
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,164

Well, I feel the same way about you.

1459
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,601

You're so good, it's intimidating.

1460
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,162

All I've ever wanted is to be one of you.

1461
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,241

Not a Legacy, but a Bella.

1462
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,410

- You are a real Bella. - Of course you're a Bella.

1463
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,609

You are one of us. You paid the registration fee.

1464
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,443

That's for life, dude.

1465
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,123

Do you wanna collaborate on something?

1466
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,930

Wait. Are you being serious?

1467
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,601

Yeah.

1468
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,281

Yeah!

1469
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,441

Wow!

1470
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,601

Man! Yes! Who else feels like a winner tonight?

1471
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,727

I know it doesn't seem like it,

1472
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,450

but I'm afraid, too.

1473
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,406

To move on, to graduate.

1474
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,884

It's really scary.

1475
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,020

Yeah, it actually does seem like it,

1476
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,043

because you're barely holding it together.

1477
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,807

Well, it doesn't have to be scary, Chloe.

1478
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,486

When I was graduating, I never pictured myself

1479
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,122

running a retreat in the middle of the woods,

1480
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,124

but here I am.

1481
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,130

Take it from someone who

1482
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:54,088

has dealt with some serious control issues.

1483
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,244

Like my dad always said,

1484
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,650

in the minefield of life,

1485
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,171

you must be prepared to lose both feet.

1486
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,767

And I think you all know what I mean.

1487
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,321

I don't.

1488
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,445

Then it's decided.

1489
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,688

This year I will graduate.

1490
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,128

The Worlds will be my swan song.

1491
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,966

I mean it. I'll pursue my passion.

1492
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,327

I'll teach underprivileged children how to sing,

1493
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,363

or I'll dance exotically.

1494
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,921

Whatever offers the most money.

1495
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,651

Yo, check this out.

1496
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,207

I'm moving to Maine to get hitched.

1497
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,540

And all y'all can come.

1498
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,220

Everybody's invited.

1499
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,448

Yes, yes, yes.

1500
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,200

Okay, okay, guys. Stop asking. I'll tell you.

1501
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:46,288

So, after I graduate there's a chance I will be deported.

1502
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,340

I will try to re-enter this country,

1503
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,363

but I will probably die at sea.

1504
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,449

So, let's live for tonight! Yes!

1505
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,700

Yeah!

1506
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,609

- Yes! - All right.

1507
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,445

Lilly, any plans?

1508
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,210

Just gonna travel through time.

1509
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,365

You know, when I look back on this,

1510
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,540

I won't remember performing and competing.

1511
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,290

I'm gonna remember you weirdos.

1512
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,140

It makes me really sad to think

1513
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,083

it won't ever be like this again.

1514
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,485

I'm gonna miss you guys.

1515
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,722

- Me, too. - Me, too.

1516
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,122

Yeah. Me, too.

1517
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,808

Did we just find our sound?

1518
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,770

I think we did.

1519
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,763

My work here is done.

1520
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,441

Thank you.

1521
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,442

Fat Amy, you never told

1522
01:21:30,443 --> 01:21:32,540

us what you were gonna do after graduation.

1523
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,641

Oh. Well...

1524
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,881

Mmm.

1525
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,700

No, I don't have any plans.

1526
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,168

'Cause you guys know me, I just love living in the moment.

1527
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,220

Ashley, what are you gonna do after...

1528
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,321

Actually, though,

1529
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,923

if we were to stop and really think,

1530
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,971

"What could Fat Amy be capable of in the future?"

1531
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,845

I'll tell you guys.

1532
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,607

I'd be living somewhere, like, sick, like Tulsa or Little Rock.

1533
01:21:55,160 --> 01:22:00,007

By day, I'm a professional jelly wrestler for corporate events.

1534
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,448

And then, every night,

1535
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,486

it's just me cuddled up with my fiancé, Bumper, and...

1536
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,681

Oh, wait.

1537
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,740

I'm in love with Bumper.

1538
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,841

- Mmm-hmm. - Yeah.

1539
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,844

Okay, I've done something terrible,

1540
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,288

and I'm not talking about crop-dusting Chloe and Beca right now.

1541
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,601

Apologize for that.

1542
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,969

You guys, I need to go right now.

1543
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,963

And I need to win back my man!

1544
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,580

Screw your judgments!

1545
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,524

Go get him, Fat Amy!

1546
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,881

Guys, what happened?

1547
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,180

Shake it off, Amy.

1548
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,340

That was bad.

1549
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,204

Somebody bring a s'more.

1550
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,884

I give you our next album cover.

1551
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,371

Look at him!

1552
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,460

I did it all myself today.

1553
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,460

Now, I know that I only have one vote...

1554
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,244

You got no votes, man. You're not in the group, so...

1555
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,620

Okay, well, that hurts my feelings.

1556
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,780

It's just the truth, is the thing.

1557
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,940

Well, that hurts my feelings.

1558
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,964

With my vote, I vote "No" To the pig

1559
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,340

and "Yes" To this gloriousness.

1560
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,363

- Yeah, it's great. We'll put it to a vote. - No.

1561
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,249

Bumper, I'm coming!

1562
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,810

Nope! Turn it around!

1563
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,140

I don't wanna see you!

1564
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,242

Whew. Really misjudged the size of this lake.

1565
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,602

Why didn't she just walk around the lake?

1566
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,285

Fat Amy doesn't do anything small.

1567
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,562

Yes, I've been using my shower shoes.

1568
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,485

Okay, I love you, too. Here she is.

1569
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,766

What up, Mrs. Junk?

1570
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,321

Go!

1571
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,770

Well, what are you doing?

1572
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,241

I'm soloing, here!

1573
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,170

Whatever!

1574
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:01,780

No!

1575
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,241

Well, all right.

1576
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,561

All right, let's go. Into the house.

1577
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,685

Give me that neck.

1578
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,731

I mean, we can do... Do you want it...

1579
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,531

Do you feel like you'd want to layer a bunch of voices?

1580
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,500

I think in the beginning it could definitely build.

1581
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,443

I think it starts out light, though.

1582
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,660

Get your cute butt in the studio, then.

1583
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,660

Don't tell my boss that we were in here, by the way.

1584
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,140

I got all I need when I got you and I

1585
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,687

'Cause I look around me and see a sweet life

1586
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,121

This is... Wow!

1587
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,660

It's the real deal.

1588
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,966

Yeah, don't touch anything, Legacy.

1589
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,610

You're very pretty, but you seem clumsy.

1590
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,406

Great.

1591
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,561

Okay.

1592
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,260

Can't lie it's a sweet life

1593
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,700

I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight

1594
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,690

You're getting me Getting me through the night

1595
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,086

You're my flashlight

1596
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,606

You're my flashlight

1597
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,330

You're my flashlight

1598
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,166

Okay, so you produced this?

1599
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,965

Uh, yes. Emily wrote it.

1600
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,801

- Mmm-hmm. Who's Emily? - I am.

1601
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,486

- This tall drink of water, right there. - Hey. Emily.

1602
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,126

Well...

1603
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,242

Um...

1604
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,323

I don't... I don't... I don't like it.

1605
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,244

What it is, is I don't like it when people can do what I can do.

1606
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,606

You know, in a manner of speaking, it's threatening.

1607
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,002

But, you just did it.

1608
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,684

And I have a...

1609
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,640

I have a few notes that I assume that you're open to.

1610
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,802

- Yes. - Um, but this is a solid demo,

1611
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,924

with real potential.

1612
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,010

Yeah, I look forward to working together.

1613
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,220

It's nice to meet you.

1614
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,049

- What is it? Elizabeth? - Emily.

1615
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,260

- Emily. - Elizabeth? What?

1616
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,362

- Emily. Thank you. - Thank you.

1617
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,848

- Oh. - I gotta jump on a call.

1618
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,580

Yeah, no. No, get it in there. Get it in there. Attagirl.

1619
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,980

- You want one of these? - Oh, hey.

1620
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,128

You want one of those? There you go. Attagirl.

1621
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:08,841

Good job, Reggie.

1622
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,201

I'm Reggie.

1623
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,966

Oh, my God, I was so nervous I didn't know what to say!

1624
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,220

Oh, my God!

1625
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,367

You're all sweaty.

1626
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,860

We're gonna be late!

1627
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,724

We're taking the photo with or without you.

1628
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,167

We're taking the photo with or without you!

1629
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,687

Everybody get together. No, no, no, together.

1630
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,724

One, two, three! Bellas for life!

1631
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,060

Okay. So, is there a restaurant in this town

1632
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,300

that serves something other than fish?

1633
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,820

I did see a KFC back there.

1634
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,140

Nope. All fish. I checked.

1635
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,402

Guys, over here. Come this way.

1636
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,524

Oh, Chloe, I'm coming for ya!

1637
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,608

Whoo-hoo. College graduates! Spreading my wings, y'all!

1638
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,162

There are so many fresh Danishes here.

1639
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,567

I swear, if I wasn't recently locked down,

1640
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,087

I would tear a hole through this city!

1641
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,043

This place is so smelly and rainy.

1642
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,402

Why do Americans ever leave America?

1643
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,040

Culture, design, history.

1644
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,445

I'm not copen-hating this place.

1645
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,540

I'm starving.

1646
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,260

Yeah, why don't we go visit Hayden Christian Andersen's house?

1647
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:30,081

That guy? But he was pretty crap in the Star Wars prequels.

1648
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,645

Well, here we are.

1649
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,848

Do you think the stage is big enough for what we want to do?

1650
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,446

You're kidding, right? It's huge.

1651
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,080

You guys think it'll work?

1652
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,686

It'll work for us. That's what matters.

1653
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,290

Let's go!

1654
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,483

Let's do this thing!

1655
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,441

Whoo!

1656
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,971

Everyone knows where to meet, right?

1657
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,322

Yeah, we know.

1658
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,482

All right. Safety first, Flo.

1659
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,646

Here it is, folks. The granddaddy of them all.

1660
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,407

The World Championship of A Cappella!

1661
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,801

Tonight, groups from around the globe duke it out

1662
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,849

for the title of A-ca World Champion.

1663
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,098

And, of course, representing America,

1664
01:30:41,099 --> 01:30:42,686

the embattled Barden Bellas.

1665
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,401

The Bellas, making one last attempt to repair a damaged legacy

1666
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,211

by becoming the first American team to claim the title.

1667
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,407

Can they do it, John?

1668
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,528

Theoretically, yes, Gail.

1669
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:56,207

Realistically, absolutely not. Those girls are dead to me.

1670
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,488

So many countries represented here tonight, John.

1671
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,729

We saw in rehearsal an incredible group from the Philippines.

1672
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,041

What were they called?

1673
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,690

"The Ladyboys."

1674
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,524

That wasn't the name of the group, I don't think.

1675
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,045

I think that's how they described themselves.

1676
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,820

That's right. They're "Manila Envy."

1677
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,900

Manila Envy.

1678
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,460

You know, I spent some time with

1679
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,460

some ladyboys, uh, in the Philippines myself.

1680
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,561

Not surprising.

1681
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,609

Very interesting young men.

1682
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,728

Doing amazing things with their mouths, I presume.

1683
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,884

When we go back to the stage, I'll do a few for you here.

1684
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,380

- Uh, you know, we can get to it, I think. - Okay.

1685
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,300

You know, maybe when the Koreans are out there,

1686
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,767

because no one cares about the Korean group.

1687
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,530

Love that barbeque.

1688
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,965

What are you doing here?

1689
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,121

Oh, you...

1690
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,402

You know, anything to support the Bellas.

1691
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:45,881

Wow. I...

1692
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,740

Now I'm the one who can't speak.

1693
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,100

I'm just so freaking nervous.

1694
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,201

Oh, my God. Don't be.

1695
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,447

You'll be great.

1696
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,602

I mean, we heard you guys rehearsing, like, 24/7.

1697
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,608

So I'll... I should probably go find my seat.

1698
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,491

Yeah.

1699
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,768

But before I go, I just...

1700
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,605

I have something for you.

1701
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,521

Oh...

1702
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:15,524

I'm so sorry. I thought

1703
01:32:15,525 --> 01:32:17,020

that that was going in a different direction.

1704
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,020

- That's my bad. - No, no, I liked it.

1705
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,121

Em, you ready?

1706
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,642

Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there.

1707
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,290

Benji.

1708
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,086

Okay. Well, break a leg.

1709
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,721

DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1710
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:16,921

DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1711
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,570

DSM! Ja!

1712
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,761

- Ooh! - Well done!

1713
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,140

There they go, the Indian group, the Naan-Stops,

1714
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:36,323

running off stage to take a few more of our jobs.

1715
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,482

I thought the little one was spicy!

1716
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,047

DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1717
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,242

And coming up next, Das Sound Machine.

1718
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,447

A crowd favorite, John.

1719
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,660

DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1720
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:51,761

Hear that?

1721
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,487

They chant. For us.

1722
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,491

Now, don't cry too hard when you lose, huh?

1723
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,165

Makes eyes puffy.

1724
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,924

Your hands are so soft.

1725
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,447

I'm sorry, I don't speak "Loser." What did you say?

1726
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,420

She actually speaks eight languages,

1727
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,363

but "Loser" Is not one of them.

1728
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,090

Everything must come to an end.

1729
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,446

Even the Bellas.

1730
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,926

Take care and lose nice.

1731
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,660

Huh, your sweat smells like cinnamon.

1732
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:16,761

Damn it!

1733
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:27,122

...Das Sound Machine!

1734
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,241

Dsm!

1735
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,882

They've got the crowd going wild!

1736
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,166

Okay, shake it off.

1737
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,164

Dsm! Dsm!

1738
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,460

Das Sound Machine.

1739
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,882

An incredible performance once again from the German group.

1740
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,340

I'm telling you, Gail, though,

1741
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,340

if the Bellas of old show up tonight,

1742
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:49,500

this could be the most significant conflict

1743
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,649

between America and Germany in history.

1744
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,126

Crack a book, John.

1745
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:01,089

Pass one down to your friends. Here you go. Thank you.

1746
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,850

All right, here you go, buddy.

1747
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:04,060

Thanks, man.

1748
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,525

Where have you been?

1749
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,649

You have no idea, dude.

1750
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,325

Final performance, guys.

1751
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,801

We need to get out there and beat DSM.

1752
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,084

This one's for us.

1753
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,242

Guys, there's gonna be some haters out there.

1754
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,700

They're gonna look at us, Team USA,

1755
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,644

and be like, "Why is the most talented one Australian?"

1756
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:27,442

Well, guess what. I am fat. So that is close enough.

1757
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,922

We are gonna show them who we are.

1758
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,082

A bunch of ethnically diverse,

1759
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,322

for the most part feminine,

1760
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,420

amazing singers!

1761
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,580

Yeah!

1762
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,340

Let's just go out there and ac' the world!

1763
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,601

Yes!

1764
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,841

- Yeah! - Yes!

1765
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,980

John, it's possible we are watching

1766
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,020

the last hurrah of the Barden Bellas.

1767
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,248

It's going to be very hard to pull this off,

1768
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,820

and if they don't,

1769
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:54,060

they are out of business as an a cappella group.

1770
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:55,286

It is over.

1771
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,161

All right! Let's do this!

1772
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,681

...Barden University's Bellas!

1773
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,891

- Yes! - Whoo!

1774
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,331

That's my girl!

1775
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,005

Beca!

1776
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,900

When tomorrow comes

1777
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,331

I'll be on my own

1778
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:22,484

Feeling frightened of The things that I don't know

1779
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:29,006

When tomorrow comes

1780
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,925

And though the road is long I look up to the sky

1781
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,700

Is it possible the Barden Bellas

1782
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,848

are doing an original song?

1783
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,610

Then I sing along

1784
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:42,287

Then I sing along

1785
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,260

I got all I need when I got you and I

1786
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,364

'Cause I look around me and see your sweet life

1787
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,524

I'm stuck in the darkness You're my flashlight

1788
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,524

You're gettin' me gettin' me through the night

1789
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,843

You kick start my heart when you shine it in my eyes

1790
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,161

I can't lie

1791
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,964

it's a sweet life

1792
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,169

I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight

1793
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,971

You're gettin' me through the night

1794
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,460

Look at this!

1795
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,289

It looks like the Barden Bellas are being

1796
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,940

joined on stage by generations of Bellas,

1797
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,042

going all the way back to the beginning.

1798
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:27,367

'Cause you're my flashlight

1799
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:29,300

You're my flashlight

1800
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:32,404

You're gettin' me through the night

1801
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,245

I got all I need when I got you and I

1802
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:38,404

'Cause I look around me and see your sweet life

1804
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:44,724

You're getting me through the night

01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,924

Kick start my heart when you shine it in my eyes

1806
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:51,084

I can't lie, It's a sweet life

1807
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:54,050

I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight

1808
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,180

You're gettin' me through the night

1809
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,248

We belong

1810
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,980

'Cause you're my flashlight

1811
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,445

'Cause you are

1812
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,763

'Cause you're my flashlight

1813
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,610

I'm your flashlight

1814
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,604

You're gettin' me through the night

1815
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,011

'Cause you're my flashlight

1816
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,242

'Cause you're my

1817
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,169

Gettin' me through the

1818
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,800

Night

1819
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,161

Whoo!

1820
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:44,162

"Simple," "Raw," "Vulnerable," "Exposed."

1821
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:47,580

I've been called a lot of things, Gail. But let me add one more.

1822
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:48,860

I'm impressed.

1823
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,962

I thought you were gonna say "Gay."

1824
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,481

- Emily! - Yeah!

1825
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,201

Emily!

1826
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,522

Emily! Emily!

1827
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,768

Whoo! Whoo!

1828
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,768

Bellas! Bellas! Bellas!

1829
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:10,688

Bellas! Bellas! Bellas!

1830
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:14,020

Oh. They have touched every person here.

1831
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,282

They've touched me, John.

1832
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,727

Well, everyone has touched you, Gail,

1833
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,008

but this is something else.

1834
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,580

It's ceremonial,

1835
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:41,715

and you should definitely

1836
01:44:41,716 --> 01:44:43,580

not drink it 'cause it is essentially poison.

1837
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:44,900

- Terrible for you. - Okay.

1838
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,365

- Okay. - Great.

1839
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,840

Ooh. It smells like cherries and vanilla.

1840
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,047

Okay, repeat after me.

1841
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,884

"I..." Sing your name.

1842
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,260

I...

1843
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,420

Emily...

1844
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,660

Okay.

1845
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,684

"Promise to uphold the ideals of a Bella woman forever."

1846
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:02,411

Promise to uphold the ideals of a Bella woman forever.

1847
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,085

And that's it. That's the end of the speech.

1848
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,561

Nothing weird happens after that.

1849
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:07,881

These are for you.

1850
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:09,565

Don't go in the basement, it's haunted.

1851
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:10,980

Wait!

1852
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,491

One last thing.

1853
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,529

Yes, every Bella must christen the house

1854
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,409

by sliding down the staircase.

1855
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,201

Seriously?

1856
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,964

- It's tradition. - Yeah.

1857
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,088

Don't worry. I'll show you.

1858
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,210

Behold!

1859
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,084

Crushed it.

1860
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,607

Good form.

1861
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,250

Now I'm ready to move on.

1862
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,245

Legacy, you're up.

1863
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,361

All right, I'm ready.

1864
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,441

Let's do this!

1865
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,140

Yes!

1866
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:34,980

You can't!

1867
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,238

You can't turn back around.

1868
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,084

That's not part of the rules! That's not...

1869
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:39,761

That bad?

1870
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:50,761

Thank you so much, Pharrell.

1871
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:01,805

Adam, turn around!

1872
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:04,122

Everybody's doing it, baby! They love me!

1873
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:06,442

America loves me!

1874
