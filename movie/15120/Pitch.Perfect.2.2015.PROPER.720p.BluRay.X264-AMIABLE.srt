1
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,534
Welcome back,
a cappella enthusiasts.

2
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,868
My name is John Smith,

3
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,120
and sitting here to my left

4
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,372
is Gail
Abernathy-McCadden-Feinberger.

5
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,790
Oh, this one's
gonna stick, John.

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,126
Well, you saved the Jew for last.
I did. I did.

7
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,669
You're listening to
Let's Talk-Appella,

8
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,588
the world's premiere
downloadable a cappella podcast.

9
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,966
We are coming to you live
from the nation's capital,

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,175
where the
Barden University Bellas

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,137
are about to rock
the historic Kennedy Center.

12
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,722
Boy, these girls
have broken down

13
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,890
every single barrier in their path,
haven't they, Gail?

14
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,058
Absolutely, John.

15
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,519
The first all-female group
to win a national title,

16
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,980
three-time defending champs,
and now, here they are,

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,650
performing for the President of the
United States on his birthday.

18
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,444
Wow!
What an inspiration

19
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,947
to girls all over the country who
are too ugly to be cheerleaders.

20
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,535
Here's Beca Mitchell,
leader of the group.

21
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,121
Look at these
sequins and sparkles.

22
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,540
Oh, my! Their feet
just don't stop moving.

23
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,780
Florencia Fuentes just earned
her green card, John.

24
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,573
She may have to
do that backflip

25
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,575
right back over
the fence into Mexico.

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,077
I think she's Guatemalan.

27
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,411
Oh, none of that matters.

28
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,163
There is so much
happening on stage,

29
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,040
I don't even know
where to look.

30
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,919
Back in my day,
we put on our blazers and we just sang.

31
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,163
We maybe snapped our fingers
if we were feeling frisky.

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,603
Whoa!
Another surprise!

33
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,523
An overweight girl
dangling from the ceiling.

34
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,025
Who hasn't had that dream?
Lots of us.

35
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,551
No!

36
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,887
Okay, she has no underwear on.
Oh, my God.

37
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,131
We have a commando situation.

38
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,223
There is a commando
situation on stage!

39
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,850
Who is on top of this?

40
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,476
- What kind of person...
- Holy cow!

41
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,478
Take her back up.
She's turning.
Pull her up already!

42
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,188
She's turning.
Brace yourselves.
No.

43
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,565
She's coming.
She's coming!

44
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,735
Avert your eyes,
or take it all in!
Make your choice!

45
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,153
Not the front!
Nobody wants to see the front!

46
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,529
Oh, no!

47
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,910
Happy birthday,
Mr. President.

48
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,787
The Australian singer
who calls herself "Fat Amy"

49
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,915
gave the President a
birthday gift from down under

50
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,249
during last night's celebration

51
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,585
held at the historic
Kennedy Center.

52
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,587
In case you're wondering what I mean by
"down under," Chip,

53
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,172
I'm talking about her.

54
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,507
She showed her
to the President.

55
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,681
All eyes were on the a cappella singers,
the Barden Bellas.

56
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,060
...three-time defending
a cappella national champions,

57
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,854
which is a real thing,
apparently.

58
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,607
Although authorities have
ruled out terrorism as a motive,

59
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,610
the Bellas claim the mishap
was merely an accident

60
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,028
and issued an apology.

61
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:44,075
I am deeply sorry for the
upset that I have caused.

62
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,287
I feel that I have already
received punishment enough

63
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,623
in the form of silk burn.

64
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,249
Exhibit C.

65
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,334
No, no, no!

66
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,377
It's filth.

67
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,462
Women who sing
are just another example

68
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,839
of cultural decay,
due to loose morals.

69
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,174
Not wearing underwear

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,968
seems kind of intentional to me.
Mmm.

71
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,512
Yeah, you either
choose to wear underwear,
or you don't wear underwear.

72
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,180
It's a choice
I make every day.

73
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,766
You know, until today,
I thought singing a cappella

74
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,060
was the most embarrassing
thing you could do.

75
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,937
Normally,
that group is on point,

76
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,647
and last night,
they were off-point,

77
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,065
off-key,
and then on the floor.

78
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,233
It's a national disgrace.

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,776
Yeah, but I'd
rather be in that

80
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,236
limo ride home
with the President.

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,880
Cut to the real President,
he'd be like,

82
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,948
"That
was off the hook!"

83
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,644
Chloe, chill out.
It was a mistake.

84
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,354
They're not gonna
burn us for witchcraft.

85
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,523
No, but the National
A Cappella Association

86
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,025
is in there talking
to the dean about us,

87
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,429
and who knows
what's gonna happen?

88
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,028
We won three championships.

89
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,952
Whatever happens in there,
we're gonna be fine.

90
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,615
Maybe it's time to
think about other stuff.

91
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,034
What other stuff?

92
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,286
You know,
school, jobs, life.

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,455
This group is my life.

94
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,540
I've intentionally failed
Russian Lit three times

95
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,000
so I could be a Bella.

96
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,794
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to us.
Ever.

97
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,506
You know,
before coming to Barden,

98
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,717
I had diarrhea
for seven years.

99
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,138
But yes, this is terrible.

100
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,016
The dean is ready
for you tramps.

101
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,642
Oh, jeez.

102
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,519
Ladies,

103
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,438
you have dragged
the good name

104
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,232
of Barden University
into the gutter.

105
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,485
And you've really
upset these people

106
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,570
whose names
I've already forgotten.

107
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,990
Your little southern exposure in
front of our Commander-in-Chief

108
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,911
has irreparably damaged the
entire institution of a cappella.

109
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,079
Just blew it up.

110
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,081
Funding is drying up,
sponsors are pulling out.

111
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,958
Mmm-hmm. Unfortunately,
an example must be made.

112
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,252
It is the decision
of this governing body

113
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,380
that the Bellas
are hereby suspended

114
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,267
from competing at the collegiate level.
What?

115
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,967
The terms of your suspension

116
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,594
are laid out
in this document.

117
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,971
I'm sorry,
but it's over.
Hi.

118
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,765
Okay, can we be reasonable?

119
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,267
Fat Amy apologized.
This was an accident.

120
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,477
Was it?

121
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,854
You're taking us off
of our victory tour?

122
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,482
Who's gonna sing the national
anthem at the Puppy Bowl?

123
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,443
You're being replaced
by the European champions.

124
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,113
A German group
of total professionals.

125
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,157
In other words, they're gonna
keep their pants on.

126
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,617
So we can't defend our title
and we can't tour?

127
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,410
And you can't
hold any auditions.

128
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,413
We don't need your ranks
to grow like a fungus.

129
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,623
Oh, so that's it, then?

130
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,667
So, basically,
the Bellas are over?

131
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,751
Look, ladies,

132
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:44,547
I'm sorry that this disciplinary
action has shocked you.

133
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,549
Especially since
you're all seniors.

134
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,675
But the truth is,

135
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,968
you're just women.

136
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,261
No.

137
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,263
And you'll all be pregnant soon.
Mmm.

138
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,225
Mom, I'm late.

139
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,561
It's orientation.
You gotta let me go.

140
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,312
Oh, I can't.

141
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,438
I just can't do it.

142
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,523
Mom, you can do it.

143
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,526
My only daughter,
leaving the nest.

144
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,405
If you leave me now

145
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:14,493
You'll take away
the biggest part of me

146
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,078
Mom.
You want me to stop?

147
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,454
Or I could keep singing!

148
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,831
No, I don't know
how I'm gonna get by

149
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,250
without your
spontaneous singing.

150
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,669
Oh, honey, you're gonna
love this place.

151
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,838
Just promise you'll call.

152
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,216
Oh, and, honey,
don't be afraid to express yourself.

153
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,886
And not with those weird buttons
they wear in their earlobes.

154
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,596
Unless you're gonna get a job...
Mom, slow down.

155
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,472
I'm not gonna do
anything crazy.

156
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,877
I'm just gonna write my songs
and join an a cappella group.

157
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,436
Not just
any a cappella group.

158
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,522
The Bellas are an institution.

159
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,050
My days as a Bella
were the best...

160
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,650
Best days of your life.

161
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,361
I know.
And I can't wait to be one.

162
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,822
Unless they don't
take me, Mom.

163
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,074
Oh, no, honey,
they're gonna take you.

164
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,619
Thanks to me,
you were born into it.

165
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,537
And then I'm gonna
be your mother...

166
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,290
And your sister

167
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,875
Gross. Okay.

168
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,796
All right,
the next phase of my life

169
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,633
begins.

170
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Hold on.

171
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,553
There is nothing in here that
strips us of our national title.

172
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,388
And if we're still
reigning champs,

173
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,891
then we are automatically
invited to represent America

174
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,434
at the World Championships
this spring.

175
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,062
Ah, yes, the World
Championships of A Cappella,

176
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,480
where, every four years,

177
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,608
groups from around the globe
compete for world domination.

178
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,277
I'm sorry. I just feel like I always
have to be on, you know.

179
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,737
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, look, ladies,

180
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,241
we can't stop you from going
to the Worlds competition.

181
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,909
It's not gonna
help your case here.

182
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,035
Not at all.

183
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,245
What if we win it?

184
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,329
What if you win it?

185
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,916
Like, you...

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,001
You out-perform
the other groups?

187
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,092
How do you fit such big
dreams in such a small body?

188
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,677
What if you win it?

189
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,099
Never.

190
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,101
What if you win it?

191
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,812
Yeah. If we win,
will you reinstate us?
Sure.

192
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,898
But no American team
has ever won.

193
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,317
That's because they hate us.

194
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,777
The whole world.

195
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,112
The whole world hates us.

196
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,405
Hate us.

197
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:14,613
Hello, fresh-persons!

198
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,865
Hello, fresh-persons!

199
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,535
Welcome to Barden University!

200
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,166
Okay! The Barden Knight.

201
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,128
Okay, get off the stage.
No one cares about you.
All right.

202
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,756
You have made a great choice,
and a cheap one.

203
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,551
Yay, Barden!

204
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,054
We have a very special
performance for you guys today.

205
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,391
The pride and joy
of Barden University,

206
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,476
the Treblamakers!

207
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,480
Thank you!
Thank you, thank you.

208
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,649
We are the Treblemakers.

209
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,027
I'm Jesse,
and this is a cappella.

210
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,778
Let's do this!

211
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,739
Hey yo, Trebles!

212
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,048
Someone drop some bass.

213
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,052
Now I need some baritone.

214
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,847
All right!

215
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,683
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

216
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,518
Chloe,
don't blame yourself.
Oh, my God!

217
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,854
You're a ginger.
That's punishment enough.

218
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,606
This is not all your fault.
This is on all of us.

219
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,859
So, if we don't win the Worlds,
then what are we?

220
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,111
Just a bunch of girls
that hang out?

221
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,487
What's wrong with that?

222
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,573
If we don't win,
the Bellas are over.

223
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,534
This is the biggest challenge
that any of us have ever faced.

224
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,622
When I was nine years old,
my brother tried to sell
me for a chicken, so...

225
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,166
Well, I will do
whoever it takes

226
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,625
in order for us
to get back to the top.

227
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,870
You mean "whatever" it takes.

228
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,211
Yeah, I'll do that, too.

229
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,714
That's great news. Yes.

230
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,468
No, I can start Monday.
I would be stoked to start on...

231
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,720
Sorry, I don't say "stoked."
I don't say stuff like that.

232
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,097
I'm, like, I'm pretty cool.
You're gonna like me.

233
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,682
That was bad, too.

234
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,143
We need to attack
this problem head-on.

235
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,313
I want 100% commitment
and laser focus, right?

236
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,732
Great! I will see you Monday.

237
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,234
Beca out!

238
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,654
- Beca.
- Yeah.

239
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,239
Hey, ladies.
Wanna come to a party?

240
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,159
It's a tiki party.
You guys don't even have to wear shoes.

241
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,619
It's the best kind of party.

242
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,871
Here you go.
Sure.

243
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,832
Hey, great job, Trebles.
You guys killed it.

244
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,917
Oh, thank you.

245
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,835
You like a cappella?
Oh, yeah.

246
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,338
I've got my heart set
on being a Bella.

247
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,381
It's actually at the very top
of all my dream boards.

248
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,674
Did I hear
mention of dreams?

249
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,302
Hi. Benjamin Applebaum
at your service. Hello.

250
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,764
I just have to say,
you are so spirited. I...

251
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,099
I just wanna put you in a box
and saw you in half.

252
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,684
For magic.

253
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,437
As a part of a trick.
He does magic.

254
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,981
Right.
It's only weird
if you don't embrace it.

255
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,566
Dude, explain yourself.

256
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,891
I'll be honest,
I completely blacked out.
How'd I do, man?

257
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,612
Honestly?
I've seen you do worse.

258
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,780
Awesome.

259
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,954
It's been months and
we're still getting hate mail?

260
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,121
Sucks!

261
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,957
"For your hairy situation"?

262
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,376
Oh.

263
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,379
Okay,
we are officially registered.

264
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,756
Update your passports, ladies,
because we are going

265
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,761
to the very sunny,
very beautiful, Copenhagen!

266
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,721
Yeah! Nice!
Yes!

267
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,348
Oh.

268
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,225
Where is that?

269
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,977
I don't know. I failed Maps.

270
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,104
It looks like the competition
has been dominated

271
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,232
by that stupid German group
that took over our tour.

272
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,484
- You mean "stole" our tour.
- Word.

273
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,361
We need to scout
those Deutsche-bags.

274
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,445
Yes.

275
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,239
But how good can they be?

276
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,950
Germany hasn't produced a
good singer since David Hasselhoff.

277
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,577
We're gonna crush them.

278
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,786
And when we do,

279
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,121
we can stick it
to these chumps

280
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,331
who send us all
this hate mail, like,

281
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,458
"Sonia Sotomayor."

282
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,378
Judgy bitch.

283
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,588
The Bellas are back!

284
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,424
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Yeah! We're back.

285
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,676
Has anyone talked
to Beca today?

286
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
So?

287
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,886
Any first-day jitters?

288
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,680
No, no. You know,
I'm just gonna

289
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,473
be moody and distant.
Artists love that.

290
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,558
I know I love that.

291
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,310
Here you go.

292
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,519
Okay.

293
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,439
Dude, why do I
feel so guilty?

294
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,003
I've given a lot to
the Bellas, right?

295
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,442
It's, like,
three years of my life.

296
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,820
Yeah, Bec,
you should not feel guilty
at all about taking your shot.

297
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,988
This is a big deal, right?

298
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,198
Yes, it's a very big deal.
Okay.

299
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,701
Go.
All right.

300
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,372
Nothing's gonna stop my girl!

301
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,749
I don't know him!

302
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,125
Becs in effects, y'all!

303
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,710
You can go!

304
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,050
Are you ready, or...

305
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,581
Okay, everybody, huddle up.

306
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,501
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Get up!

307
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,670
Come on!
To the table, please!
To the table!

308
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,506
Last one at this table has
to help Frank watch YouTube videos

309
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,132
to find
the next Justin Bieber.

310
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,842
Hey, so, I'm turning 25
next week,

311
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,928
if anybody wants to
get some drinks, celebrate.

312
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,138
Frank, buddy, less talk.

313
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,848
Thank you so much.

314
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,017
Okay, my people, check it out.

315
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,478
That...

316
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,774
This... Dax, the tech guy.
Did you call the tech guy?

317
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,192
Yeah, I talked to him.

318
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,445
Do you understand that
everything else in my life works?

319
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,863
Uh-huh.

320
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,657
So, I just need everything here to work,
too, okay?

321
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,826
Well, he said he was gonna call me back.
Oh, my God.

322
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,906
You want me to call him now?

323
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,871
Don't do it now.

324
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,248
Okay.

325
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,791
There we go.

326
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,877
That is the Lion himself.

327
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,381
That is the legendary
Snoop D-O-Double-G

328
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,134
singing White Christmas at a
tree-lighting ceremony in Moscow.

329
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,261
And he was so moved
by the power of music

330
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,054
to unite the world
or some shit,

331
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,515
that now he wants to drop
his own cool Christmas album.

332
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,809
And because I sleep
on a bed of Grammys,

333
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,353
he has decided to hire me
to produce it. Now...

334
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,439
But Snoop Dogg already dropped
a Christmas album.

335
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,566
If you had listened to
the album like I did,

336
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,778
stranded in the air with T.I.
on a golden hang glider,

337
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,198
then you would have known that
none of the songs were the classics.

338
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,160
I've had to listen to that album on
two separate occasions.

339
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,870
Hang glider with T.I.

340
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,497
and also a rocket ship
that Eminem has built.

341
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,458
It doesn't go anywhere,

342
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,460
but he's got dreams
for it, okay?

343
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,171
So I need you to
close your mouth.

344
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,173
Herein lies the problem,
everybody.

345
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,301
Last time I checked,
there are over a million Christmas albums

346
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,928
with the same
10 damn songs on them.

347
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,764
So, guys,
I'm telling you, man,

348
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,016
I need all hands
on deck right now

349
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,186
to come up with ideas on
how to make this one stand out.

350
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,729
Okay? You got it?

351
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,898
Fire when ready.
I want to hear ideas.

352
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,691
Anything.

353
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,526
Anybody.

354
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,652
Anybody right now
would be great.

355
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,279
Anybody to talk...
What if we got those dogs...

356
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,822
Anybody but you.

357
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,909
What if we got those dogs that bark
Jingle Bells to back him up?

358
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,619
And let me, let me,
let me guess, let me guess.

359
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,914
You want those dogs to back
him up because he's "Snoop Dogg"?

360
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:44,998
Yeah!

361
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,958
That is a really great example

362
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,794
of a horrible idea.

363
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,630
Take a lap.

364
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,508
What?
Take a lap.

365
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,009
But I'm wearing skinny jeans.

366
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,093
I don't care.

367
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,428
Go. Go.

368
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,721
Let's go.
I wanna see knees up.

369
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,890
Knees up, please.

370
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,906
Guys, I should give you
a little more time.

371
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,895
A minute. You got
one minute. 60 seconds.

372
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,524
My time is like a toddler in a tiara, okay?
Precious and short.

373
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,485
I need really great ideas.
Snoop is coming!

374
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,668
Oh. Sorry, my boobs are all crazy.
I was just jumping.

375
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,046
I just came from auditions.
You guys weren't there.

376
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,006
I was hoping for the chance
to sing for you.

377
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,884
No, can't help you.
We're not allowed to take anyone else new.

378
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,261
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

379
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,971
I'm a Junk!

380
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,472
What'd you say
about your junk?

381
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,642
I'm Emily Junk.

382
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,686
I know, it's weird.
It's my mom's last name.

383
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,521
My dad's last name
is Hardon, so...

384
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,357
Um...

385
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,777
I'm a Legacy.

386
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,320
Junk. Junk.

387
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,114
My mom was a Bella.

388
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,366
Your mother is Katherine Junk?

389
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,450
Who?

390
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,161
Only the top bitch
of the 1981 Bellas.

391
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,455
She pioneered
the syncopated booty shake.

392
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,958
And word is she has
a five-octave vocal range.

393
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,126
Yep, still does.

394
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,212
You do not want to hear that
woman doing it with my dad. Whew.

395
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,172
What an odd thing to say.

396
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,257
True.

397
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,634
If a Legacy wants to audition,
we have to let her.

398
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:20,844
Okay, um...

399
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,890
Show us what you got.

400
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,642
Right now? Right here?
Right here, right now.

401
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,019
Yeah.

402
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,398
Okay, um, I'd like to perform
an original song that I've been working on.

403
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,859
I'm not quite finished
with it though,

404
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,819
so let's not be
dicks about it.

405
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,614
Sorry, that was crass,
wasn't it?

406
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,407
Fat Amy,
you have a lovely vagina.

407
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,367
Thank you. Proceed.

408
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,999
When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own

409
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:55,253
Feeling frightened of
the things that I don't know

410
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,341
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes

411
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,511
When tomorrow comes

412
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,098
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky

413
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,767
Darkness all around...

414
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,186
No. That one, I'm not... I'm still
kind of tinkering with that verse.

415
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,521
So it's not... Nothing's
really completely set.

416
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,566
I got all I need
when I got you and I

417
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,861
'Cause I look around me
and see a sweet life

418
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,739
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

419
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,368
You're getting me, getting me
through the night

420
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:34,793
You are my flashlight

421
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,631
Would you excuse us
for just one second?

422
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,927
She's pretty good.
Can't we take her?

423
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,721
What do you expect us to say?
She's standing right there.

424
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,642
She's definitely not a soloist.
No.

425
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,728
Technically, she came to us,
so really we're not breaking any rules.

426
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,271
Yeah,
it's the perfect loophole.

427
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,983
You know, it's always good
to have an extra body.

428
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,527
Just in case one of us
gets kidnapped for ransom,

429
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,153
is thrown into
a shipping container,

430
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,198
and is made to eat
only leaves and gas receipts.

431
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,492
Mmm, I agree.
We need new blood.

432
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,911
I don't think we should
decide anything without Beca.

433
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,288
I keep a penny
under my tongue.

434
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,083
Did anyone else think
it was creepy

435
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,168
that she never really opened
her eyes the whole time?

436
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,087
Again, we're talking about her

437
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,922
and she's standing right there.
Oh, yeah.

438
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,340
But if we're
gonna talk negatives,

439
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,134
let's start with
the giraffe legs.

440
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,678
Okay, let's take a vote on it.

441
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,322
Anyone who wants her in,
sing a G-sharp.

442
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,723
Anyone who doesn't,
sing an E-flat.

443
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,599
Okay.
One, two...

444
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,109
I like your shirt.

445
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,363
Welcome to the Bellas!

446
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,533
O-M-a-ca-G! Whoo!

447
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,661
Oh. Stop, girl, stop.
Yeah, stop, stop it.

448
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,288
- Girl, stop.
- Sorry.

449
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,041
So, when does
initiation start?

450
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,293
Tell you what,
I'll go back to my dorm
and pretend to be surprised

451
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,502
when you throw
the hood over my head

452
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,628
and make me
solve a Rubik's Cube

453
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,297
while sucking vodka
from a maxi pad.

454
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,049
That's what
my mom said happened.

455
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,133
Mmm, no can do.

456
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,426
Well, look around.

457
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,971
We don't exactly have
a maxi pad to spare, so...

458
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,224
All right,
grab your guts, ladies!
It's party time!

459
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,810
We've got tickets to Copenhagen
and a brand new Bella!

460
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,773
Let's go!
All right.

461
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,611
- Should I...
- Come on, girl!

462
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,154
I'm gonna just
leave my bag here.

463
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,490
Let's go get
into treble!

464
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,325
Has this bush
always been here?

465
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,493
Oh! Watch this.

466
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,777
You know
there's a gate, right?

467
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,291
Wow.

468
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,335
My first college party.

469
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,004
Yeah, well, this isn't
just any college party.

470
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,757
This is a cappella only!
Yeah.

471
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,843
So, get prepared to meet
a lot of sexually confused men.

472
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,387
Bellas!
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

473
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,390
Jesse! Where is Beca? I thought she
was gonna be with you tonight.

474
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,475
I thought she was with you.

475
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,893
I thought she was with you.

476
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,731
Hey! Benji, right?

477
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,446
Those aren't...
Okay, those aren't words.

478
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,909
I'm sorry?

479
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,203
...the movies?

480
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,538
Are you asking me out?

481
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Yes.
Yeah?

482
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,251
Oh.
That's so sweet.

483
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,811
It's just, my...
It's my first day. Um...

484
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,589
I wasn't really planning on
rushing in on anything.

485
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,064
Hey! Oh.
Hey! You made it!

486
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,900
Yeah, I couldn't miss
our last Hood Night party.

487
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,360
Oh.
So?

488
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,487
How was the internship?

489
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,990
Eye-opening.
Yeah, they do not mess around.

490
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,908
Hey, Chloe asked
where you were.

491
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,535
Why didn't you tell her?

492
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,245
Oh. She's just...

493
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,414
She's locked into
the Worlds right now

494
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,707
and I'm looking
for the right time.

495
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,916
I'll tell her.

496
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,960
Bumper's back!

497
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,253
Whoo!

498
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,046
Campus security!

499
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,257
Bumper! Bumper!

500
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,259
Fat Amy's back!

501
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,887
'Cause I never left
'cause I'm still here.

502
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,599
Whoo! But I'm back, so it's a big
deal because I've arrived again!

503
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,477
You know, for someone
who left school years ago,

504
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,146
you're harder to
shake than mono.

505
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,275
I've got some
pretty big news.

506
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,359
What?

507
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,071
I have been hand-plucked
to be put on a waiting list

508
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:37,035
to be put on a very well-known
TV singing competition.

509
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,119
Really?
Yep.

510
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,284
I know
what you're thinking.

511
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,413
"Oh, Bumper.

512
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,999
"You shut your face
and kiss me, Bumper."

513
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,209
No.

514
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,419
"Bumper, please,
just shut your trap."

515
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,795
That is not how I talk.

516
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,006
You talk exactly like this.
Do not.

517
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,132
Yes, you do.

518
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,134
I don't.

519
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,345
So shut up.
You shut up.

520
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,899
Hi!

521
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,983
Hi.

522
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,152
I am so excited
to meet the woman

523
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,613
who single-handedly
created the Bella sound.

524
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,822
We're sisters!

525
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,366
I can't believe
we're sisters!

526
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:17,951
Oh! Yeah, hi!
Hi!

527
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,494
Chloe texted me
we added a Legacy.

528
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,995
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

529
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,067
Shh.

530
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,790
Remind me again why
we are at a car show.

531
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,459
We're here for one reason
and one reason only.

532
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,752
To scout the competition.

533
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,212
It's totally gonna
help us win the Worlds

534
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,588
if we know
what we're up against.

535
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,382
All right.

536
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,676
Now, where are
those tour thieves?

537
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Stacie!

538
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,804
Keep it in your pants, maybe.

539
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,389
Stacie!
What?

540
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,559
What the...

541
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,312
This all should
have been ours!

542
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,564
I hate these Germans.

543
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,984
Holy a-ca-mole!

544
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,321
Okay, the cars moved.
Nothing else happened yet.

545
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,949
But they're moving backwards.
With ghosts driving them.

546
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:46,414
We are Das Sound Machine.

547
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:51,919
A German collective, operating in
concert to create sonic mastery.

548
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,840
What better way to appreciate
automotive perfection?

549
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,157
Man, they massive!

550
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,159
How are we gonna compete
with a group that size?

551
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,619
They're so
freakin' in sync.

552
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,534
Do we clap?

553
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,618
Do we clap? Do we clap?

554
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,703
Politely clap.

555
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,381
Barden Bellas.
You came here to see us?

556
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:04,719
Is it because you are...
What do the American kids say, "Jelly"?

557
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,221
We are so not "jelly."

558
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,725
We should really thank you for
making this tour a reality,

559
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,102
you know, with your
bumbling ineptitude.

560
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,563
We should send them something.
Fruit basket?

561
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,856
Yum, yum.

562
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,400
Or would you prefer
mini-muffins?

563
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,819
Okay, we didn't come here
to start something with you guys.

564
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,696
We just wanted to
check you out before the Worlds,

565
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,156
where we're gonna
kick your ass.

566
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,116
What?
That's right.

567
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,076
You?

568
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,329
You are the kicker of ass?

569
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,331
Yeah.

570
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,333
You are so tiny.

571
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,626
Like an elf.

572
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,295
Or is it a fairy? Sprite?

573
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,964
"Troll."

574
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,133
That's it.
You are like a troll.

575
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,801
You

576
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,638
are physically flawless.

577
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,722
Thank you.

578
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,974
But it doesn't mean
I like you.

579
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,686
We are not scared
about the Worlds,

580
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,439
because when the Bellas hit the stage,
we are gonna blow minds.

581
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,524
With what?

582
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,318
More of Flabby Abby's
baby chute?

583
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,569
That's not my name.

584
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:04,779
I don't know your name.

585
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,863
Could be anything.

586
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:09,700
Obese Denise,
Inflexible Tina, Lazy Susan.

587
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,206
Mein name ist Fat Amy,
und I eat krauts like you for lunch.

588
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,377
Your team is like a...
How do you say that?
A heated mess.

589
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,547
You know, a mess where
heat is applied to it,

590
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,384
so what once was a little
messy is now even messier.

591
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,136
Darlings,
please take my advice.

592
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,055
Don't try to beat us.

593
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,390
You can't.

594
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,766
We're the best.

595
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,310
And now I really
must go rest my neck.

596
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,938
It is sore from
looking down on you.

597
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,022
Okay,

598
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,067
just because you're making me
very sexually confused,

599
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,152
does not mean that
you are intimidating.

600
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,988
We have nothing to lose.

601
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,073
We have literally nothing!
Okay.

602
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,075
A-ca wiedersehen, bitches!

603
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,744
Oh, what is happening?
I am using my hands so much.

604
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,746
All right, ladies,
focus up.

605
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,748
We need to beat
those German dummkopfs.

606
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,250
- Yes!
- Yeah.

607
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,377
Okay, we're gonna beat DSM
at their own game.

608
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,045
Do what they do, just better.

609
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,047
And we're about to do
a full skills assessment

610
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,091
to blow out our
choreography to match.

611
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,595
But the important thing
is that we have fun, right?

612
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,598
Uh, Legacy, don't take
this the wrong way,

613
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,474
but you're
the dumbest person alive.

614
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,613
And you're a cat!

615
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,115
And one...

616
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,284
Okay, Lilly,
that's really scaring me.

617
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,707
That just looks weird.

618
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,542
People are not birds.

619
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,006
Cartwheel. And roll!
Amy, that wasn't a roll.

620
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,057
Again.

621
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,531
Is it weird that we never
got around to singing today?

622
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,242
Uh, well, it's kind of
hard to start singing

623
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,161
without arrangements,
and that's on me.

624
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,621
So thank you for reminding me.

625
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,289
Yeah, Bec,
we're gonna need that ASAP

626
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,916
so we can start nailing down
our choreography.

627
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,668
Right on top of that, Chlo.
Awes!

628
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:24,752
Yeah, awes.

629
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:26,837
So I just wanted
to let you know

630
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,255
that I've been
working really hard

631
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,800
on, you know,
calming my nerves
and keeping my eyes open.

632
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,344
I was wondering if you could
give me some pointers, maybe.

633
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,387
And, you know,
with the singing...

634
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,722
I don't know exactly where you're
gonna put me in the songs, but I...

635
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,642
I don't mean to be rude.
I just have somewhere that I need to be.

636
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,851
Um...

637
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,019
You did great today.

638
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,104
Thanks.

639
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,754
Wait, hold up.
Just hold up for a second.

640
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,214
"Wait, hold up"?

641
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,702
Man, I sound awesome right now.
What are you talking about?

642
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,094
Nah! It's not you,
it's a tech thing.

643
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,470
So just
you go ahead and take five.

644
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,472
It better be a tech thing,

645
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,268
'cause the way I sound in my eardrums,
this is immaculate, man.

646
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,858
This song, there's nothing,
nothing special about it yet.

647
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,526
Do you know what I mean?

648
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,194
Any ideas? Because I...

649
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,446
All right, um, hear me out.

650
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,530
Please, Dax. Please...

651
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,867
We could remove
the sleigh bells

652
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,494
and put in kalimba.

653
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,664
You know, the finger thing.

654
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:47,460
I know what a kalimba does.
I know how it's operated, okay?

655
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,462
Kalimba...
Don't say it again.

656
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,256
Go in the corner.
Go eat your lunch in the corner.

657
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,425
But what am I gonna
do with my sriracha?

658
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,093
Say one more hipster thing,

659
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,554
and I'm gonna shove you
in your vintage bassoon case.

660
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,638
Okay?

661
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,808
Turn.

662
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,811
Aim higher, people. Okay?

663
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,731
And be very careful
what you pitch to me next.

664
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,692
Um, just have him
sing it again, the same way.

665
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,694
Who are you?

666
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,323
Nobody. Literally nobody.
I just had a thought.

667
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,533
No, okay, okay.

668
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,035
Sure.

669
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,620
Nobody else has an idea.

670
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,792
Let's, uh, do it
exactly the same way.

671
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,210
Again.

672
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,212
Will do, nephew.

673
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,284
Or it can be something different.
It can...

674
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,618
Okay.

675
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,953
That was amazing, Snoop.

676
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,663
Thank you so very much.

677
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,123
You can take
a small break, man.

678
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,667
Everything, perfection.
Perfection.

679
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,794
Groovy like a drive-in movie.

680
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,714
You can sing.

681
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:01,969
Um, yeah, I'm a three-time
collegiate a cappella champion, so...

682
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,722
We're both huge successes
in our fields.

683
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:05,848
Yeah.

684
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,474
Yeah, let's say that.

685
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,143
Uh, what do you do here?

686
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,897
I just get coffee
and burritos and stuff.

687
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,482
I wanna produce music.

688
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,401
Dax? Can you do me a favor?

689
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,029
Turn around right now,
and watch this exchange.

690
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,990
That's "value added." Okay?

691
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,450
If you have any demos
you'd like me

692
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,826
to listen to,
I'll make the time.

693
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,912
Oh, seriously?

694
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,371
Mmm-hmm. Seriously, yeah.
Oh!

695
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,081
Dax, did you see
what happened there?

696
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,292
Uh-huh.
She did something that was helpful.

697
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,587
And now I'm going to reward
her by listening to her demos.

698
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,796
Turn back around.

699
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,798
Now! Turn around, please.

700
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,595
So, Snoop, uh, buddy,
we've got an idea.

701
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,721
Me, too.

702
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,973
Water skis, but for dry land.

703
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,475
Real playa. You know what
I'm talking about?

704
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,643
Brilliant.

705
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,519
Fo shizzle, dizzle.

706
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,604
I'll write that down.

707
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,855
Yeah, please.

708
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,296
What am I looking at?

709
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,547
We're pillow fighting!

710
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,632
Aah!

711
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,885
You know this sets women back,
like, 30 years?

712
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,595
We're just
relieving some stress.

713
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,180
This was on the porch.

714
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,556
Ooh.

715
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,393
What is that? Looks fancy.

716
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,404
Looks like we've been invited
to sing at some kind of a party.

717
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,530
We're going to sing?

718
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:45,781
Finally!

719
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,992
Well, there's just
an address and a password.

720
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,868
How sexy and mysterious.
Yeah.

721
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,455
Like how all my teeth
are from other people.

722
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,667
Ow!

723
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,008
Anyone else scared?

724
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,844
Not really.
I already lived longer than I expected.

725
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:11,974
Password.

726
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:15,936
Fart noise.

727
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,772
Did you not see
the parentheses?

728
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,159
Bellas! I'm so glad
you all came. Come on in.

729
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,704
Standing in
front of you, ladies,

730
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:38,709
happens to be the world's
biggest a cappella fan.

731
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,918
We found you!

732
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,086
Hello. Here I am.

733
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,671
What can we do for you?

734
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,382
So, last week when I was
having a tinkle, it occurred to me...

735
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,884
Do not, do not!

736
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:48,761
Sorry.

737
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,012
That was rude.

738
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,182
You do not come to a gentleman's
house and touch his goose.

739
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,310
So are we early, or...

740
00:39:56,478 --> 00:40:00,439
Actually, you're pretty late.
Come on, let's go!

741
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,986
This is the big time.

742
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,001
Das Sound Machine,
two o'clock.

743
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,837
Tiny Mouse! We meet again.

744
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,839
Another verbal beatdown.

745
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,633
Highlight of my day.

746
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,637
So, have you abandoned your
foolish plans to face us at the Worlds?

747
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,974
You wish,
you gorgeous specimen.

748
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,435
She's really in my head.

749
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,686
Very well.

750
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,022
I'll be happy to
send you there.

751
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,524
I'll mail you.

752
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,859
Large envelope costs nothing.

753
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,861
Well, it will cost
more than nothing.

754
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:52,407
But still cheaper than shipping, like,
a horse, or perhaps an adult moose.

755
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,201
Did you ever think
maybe you're too big?

756
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,078
It would cost a fortune to mail you.
Easy.

757
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,496
You're enormous!

758
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
Okay.

759
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,916
I think we should change
her name to "Feisty Mouse."

760
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah.

761
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,503
Just need to find, like,
a taller pair of shoes.

762
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,587
Wasn't a big deal.
Hey!

763
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,923
Hey! What are you doing here?
What is going on?

764
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,758
Welcome!
I guess I gotta go.

765
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,385
No. Why?
I don't know.

766
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:15,556
Welcome to
the first ever showdown

767
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:22,563
of the National A Cappella
Laser Ninja Dragon League!

768
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,901
Can you dig it?

769
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,408
Okay, let's meet our teams.

770
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,244
First we have
The Treblemakers!

771
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,871
Yeah!

772
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,375
Okay.
We have the Barden Bellas.

773
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,255
We have the Tone Hangers!

774
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,340
Sorbet Sorbet

775
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,176
Sorbet Sorbet

776
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:56,054
And a cherry on top

777
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,600
And taking a break
from their national tour,

778
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,518
Das Sound Machine!

779
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:02,686
- DSM!
- Ja!

780
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,812
DSM!
Ja!

781
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:05,272
DSM!
Ja!

782
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,902
And the pride of Wisconsin,
the Green Bay Packers!

783
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,114
Let's go! Here we go, baby!

784
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,575
Let's go!
What?

785
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,952
I'd like to be the brisket
in that man-sandwich.

786
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,787
Well, here's how
this is gonna work.

787
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,082
When I point to you,
you sing a song

788
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,500
from one of the categories
that's gonna

789
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,865
appear up there
on the big board.

790
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,545
There's only one rule.

791
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,298
You have to meet the beat.
Here, come here.

792
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,808
But you have to do it
"Follow the Leader" style.

793
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,916
Oh, boy!

794
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,501
Oh, goodness.

795
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,127
That was fun.

796
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:14,841
Now, if you can't carry the tune,
the whole team's out.

797
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,303
As in, you gone! And then...

798
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,181
Cornelius, this is too heavy.
I told you before.

799
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,517
Because I hurt my arm
saluting the flag.

800
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:25,852
Okay, sorry.

801
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,481
Now, the winners will get

802
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,693
epic bragging rights!

803
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,820
What?
That's it?

804
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,738
Oh. And I'm sorry.
Did I not mention this?

805
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:40,575
A $42,000 gift card
to Dave and Buster's!

806
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
I was going there anyway.
I was going there anyway.

807
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,289
I know Clay Matthews wants it.

808
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,583
Okay. All right,
let's get this thing started.

809
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,627
Let's take a look
at the first category.

810
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,005
Ooh. Songs about butts.

811
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,423
Okay.

812
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,764
Anything on the radio,
basically, right? Right.

813
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,468
Think about
what you're gonna sing.

814
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,847
Let's start with
Das Sound Machine!

815
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,561
Girl, I love that butt

816
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,563
But the butt's not what matters
You know what does?

817
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,565
Courtship and chivalry
I'll take you to a nice hot meal

818
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,150
And I'll tip the waiter

819
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,152
Oh, my God, stop! Stop!

820
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,987
What was that, yo?

821
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,782
Not how we play the game.

822
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:50,372
You think you're a better
lyricist than Sir Mix-a-Lot,

823
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,332
a man who was
knighted by Queen?

824
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,418
You know the band Queen?
Yes.

825
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,628
No, sir, I do not.
I just... I couldn't help it.

826
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,713
I caught a glimpse
of an angel.

827
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,173
I got inspired.

828
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,758
Well, you're going to hell.

829
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,469
Because,
Treblemakers, you gone!

830
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,721
You gone!

831
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,223
Bye-bye.
Sorry.

832
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,016
Sorry. I'm sorry.

833
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,393
Four left.

834
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,062
Let's take a look
at the next category!

835
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,065
Oh. Country love!

836
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,191
Oh! Oh, oh!
I am all about this!

837
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,318
Nobody in this room has loved
more tender than I have.

838
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:21,403
Please pick us.

839
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,571
Let me have it.

840
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,240
Let us have it.
Let the world have it.
Yeah!

841
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,575
I would give it to him.

842
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,702
All right, then.
Well, why don't we start with you?

843
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,412
Tone Hangers, you're up.
You're up.

844
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,496
What?

845
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,874
All right, I got this.
I got this. I got this.

846
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,625
This is my jam!

847
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,002
How about them Cowboys?

848
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,586
Come on, man.

849
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,129
I got nothing.
Come on!

850
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,672
God damn it!
I got nothing, guys!

851
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,090
What?

852
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,720
- I'm sorry.
- You blew it.

853
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,555
Man, you are such
a dis-a-ca-pointment.

854
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,601
Reginald Wilson
Moncrieff Matthews IV,

855
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,270
what on God's green one
are you doing?

856
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:42,108
I had my mind on those
42 G's at D and B's.

857
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,861
I'm afraid you've kissed that goodbye.
No!

858
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,696
- Green Bay Packers...
- No, no, no!

859
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,198
- ...you gone!
- No!

860
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,452
Let's see what
the next category is!

861
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,454
Oh.

862
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,164
Yes! Oh!

863
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,292
Oh, I was his
personal assistant!

864
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,544
- Unfair!
- Come on.

865
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,962
Yes, yep.
We got this.

866
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,421
Yeah, we got this.
Get in there.

867
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,870
Okay, then why don't we start with you,
Das Sound Machine?

868
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,526
Is that John Mayer?

869
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,695
That doesn't
deserve a "boo."

870
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,614
I killed that!

871
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,866
Explain for everyone,

872
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,118
because it sounds like
you're implying

873
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:19,205
that John Mayer and
Tina Turner are having...

874
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,290
Oh, yeah.

875
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,375
Get them out! Get them out!

876
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,002
I don't know if I believe him.

877
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,253
I'm telling the truth!

878
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,671
Tone Hangers,

879
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:28,715
you gone!

880
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,384
Two! We have our final two!

881
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,678
Now we have a showdown!

882
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,221
All right, come on in.

883
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,849
Let's do this
face-off style. Okay.

884
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,894
Let's take a look,
see what your final category is.

885
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,898
'90s hip-hop jams!

886
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:47,567
Okay, y'all, take a second
to think about it.

887
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,152
Time's up! Go!

888
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,752
I got all I need
when I got you and I

889
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,296
'Cause I look around me
and see a sweet life

890
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,799
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

891
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,883
What?

892
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,469
You're getting me, getting me
through the night

893
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,598
I'm sorry.

894
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:05,270
What '90s hip-hop jam
is that again?

895
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,438
Um...

896
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,984
More like a 21 st century jam.

897
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:13,486
That's it. Yeah.
I wrote it.

898
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,826
Just stay calm.

899
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,247
You're saying
it's an original?

900
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,041
Yes, I'm saying
it's an original.

901
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,377
Boo!

902
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,588
Go home, little girl!

903
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,632
Our jam is covers!

904
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,259
We spit on originals!

905
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,595
What is your name?

906
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:39,929
Emily.

907
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,097
Emily.

908
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,767
I hate you.

909
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,814
In light of this embarrassing

910
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,942
and
unprofessional information,

911
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,112
I am forced to declare...

912
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,197
I'm sorry, guys.

913
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,909
...Das Sound Machine is the winner!
Yeah!

914
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,328
Whoo!

915
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,288
Yeah! Yeah!

916
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:06,748
Oh.

917
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,762
Hey, did you really
write that?

918
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,722
You shouldn't have
done that, Emily.

919
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,849
Now DSM thinks that
they have the drop on us.

920
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,142
I'm sorry. I panicked.

921
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,603
I understand if you want
me to crawl under a rock and die.

922
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,813
Hey, we don't want...

923
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,022
Hey, we don't want that.

924
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,690
Hey, Becs,

925
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,415
let's go meet the Green Bay Packers.
Okay.

926
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,703
Whew.

927
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,332
Boo!

928
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,545
I'm just kidding.
Would you like to have sex later?

929
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,712
No!

930
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,590
So that's a "no," then?

931
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,275
Because with the wink,
and that's what...

932
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,802
It's 100% no!

933
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,613
I want it! Give me!

934
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:31,624
Dax. I swear, if this kid
was not my nephew...

935
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,209
Hey, I know
you're crazy busy,

936
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,837
but have you had a chance
to check out those demos?

937
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I did.

938
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,511
This dead air between us
is a good sign.

939
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,471
Look,

940
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,015
you got a great ear,

941
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,308
you proved that
in the booth,

942
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,351
and I was super excited
to hear what else you had

943
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:53,646
and what you gave me
was more mash-ups.

944
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,690
That's sort of what I do.

945
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,151
Listen, Reggie.
Is it "Reggie"?

946
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,944
"Beca."

947
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,322
Um, that happens a lot, though.
You'd be surprised.

948
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:03,406
Okay.

949
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,866
Here's the thing.

950
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,744
Um, any kid with ears
and a laptop can do that.

951
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,370
Dax can do that.

952
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:10,580
All right?
Right.

953
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,166
So that's fine
if you want a career

954
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,834
deejaying raves
out in the desert.

955
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:18,046
But if you want to write "music producer"
on your tax forms someday,

956
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,131
then you've gotta have an original voice.
Do you understand?

957
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,300
You've gotta show me
what you have.

958
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,094
Right now, what I have is
a demo with mash-ups on it.

959
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,220
Yeah, yeah.

960
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,681
I got lots of stuff to say.
I'm just saving it all up.

961
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,807
Look...

962
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,101
Uh...

963
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,062
What is it? "Beca"?
Beca.

964
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,146
Okay, yeah.

965
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,690
So, you're an intern,

966
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,692
and everybody else
in here is an intern.

967
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:42,904
You're talented,
everybody else in here is talented.

968
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,366
So what the hell makes you special?
Do you know what I mean?

969
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,909
That's good.

970
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:51,788
So what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna give you one more shot

971
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:56,084
to show me who you are
as an artist. Okay?

972
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,543
Do not waste it.

973
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,879
No, sir, will not waste it.

974
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,131
I really hope you don't,
for your sake.

975
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,383
'Cause I would hate to think

976
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,907
that singing covers in an a
cappella group is all you can do.

977
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,889
Please replace
the paper towels.

978
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,740
Hey, it's Jesse. Text me.

979
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:30,868
Hey, it's me. Um...

980
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:34,789
Hey, so you might not be able
to hear this message,

981
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:38,001
because, it turns out,
I have nothing to say.

982
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,086
Um...

983
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,172
That's music industry speak
for "I suck."

984
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,592
You're definitely
asleep right now.

985
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,845
That's cool.

986
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,055
Text me when you're up.

987
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,223
Hey.

988
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,559
What?

989
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,144
A girl can't say
she's going to grab

990
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,271
a smoothie and return
14 hours later?

991
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,148
There's nothing
suspicious about that.

992
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,526
Why are you up
so late anyways?

993
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,696
Um, I was just
figuring some stuff out.

994
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,364
You're working on the set?

995
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,783
Um...

996
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,494
I'm not working on the set.
I'm just, like...

997
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:14,579
What?

998
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,207
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

999
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:26,549
If you did wanna
share something with me,

1000
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,176
your best friend,

1001
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,428
I'm a great keeper of secrets.

1002
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,430
I'm like a safe that locks,

1003
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,307
with a key,

1004
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:37,518
and the key is stashed
up my bum. Because...

1005
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,854
It's fine.
Forget it. It's all good.

1006
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,107
So this has nothing to do with
that internship that you sneak off to?

1007
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,525
What?

1008
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,444
Um...
Come on, Beca.

1009
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,529
You know how we do
that thing every month

1010
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,783
where I take $20 out of your purse
and you pretend not to notice?

1011
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,327
I saw your ID badge
in your bag.

1012
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,037
Don't be mad.

1013
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,955
I'm not mad, actually.

1014
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,540
About the badge.

1015
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,876
The money,
I wanna come back to.

1016
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,002
Shh.

1017
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,630
Let's just focus
on your lie.

1018
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,173
Beca,

1019
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,008
why didn't you tell us?

1020
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,511
Or at least Chloe.

1021
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,639
I don't know. Just...
'Cause it's just easier.

1022
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:17,475
There's, like,
so much going on,
and Chloe would lose her mind

1023
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,853
if she thought my sole focus
wasn't winning Worlds.

1024
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,897
Sorry, it's just
now I'm freaking out,

1025
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,233
because it turns out,
like, I'm totally

1026
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,193
not good enough to
be a music producer.

1027
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,613
Which is cool and fun to know
as I enter the rest of my life.

1028
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:33,449
Okay, I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

1029
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,910
You're the most
talented person that I know,

1030
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,995
and I've met
three of The Wiggles.

1031
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,705
Intimately.

1032
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,124
Oh.

1033
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,960
Beca, do you know
how awesome you are?

1034
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,920
You're Beca effing Mitchell.

1035
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,213
Okay?

1036
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,673
You're "The Big B.M."

1037
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:49,966
That's you.

1038
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,259
And you're awesome!

1039
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,304
Do you need some
of my confidence?

1040
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,306
'Cause I could maybe
tone mine down a notch.

1041
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,475
Yeah, okay.

1042
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,561
Then let me rub some out.

1043
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,312
Oh, okay.

1044
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,481
Wait. Think you need
a bit more.

1045
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,649
It comes from there?

1046
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,277
Okay. Thank you.
You just need that.

1047
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,195
I'm gonna get you
the good stuff now.

1048
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,488
No, I don't want
butt confidence.

1049
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:14,157
I don't want your
butt confidence!

1050
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,366
No! I have enough!

1051
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,243
I have enough!
I have enough!

1052
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,297
I believe in you, Beca.

1053
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,441
Come on.

1054
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,362
Whoa.
Candles, cloth napkins,

1055
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,616
foods other than salsa.
Yep.

1056
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,869
This is a little classier
than our typical hook-ups.

1057
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,579
Is it? Huh.

1058
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,873
I have a patisserie,

1059
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,751
some charcuterie,

1060
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:10,755
and a huge bowl
of exotic capers.

1061
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,925
I didn't know what those were,
but they're like salty peas.

1062
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,888
So,

1063
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,515
I don't know if you've
seen the news lately,

1064
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,226
but there's a war.

1065
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,562
And also, the economy

1066
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,400
is dipping
and ebbing and flowing.

1067
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,694
Bumper, what's going on?

1068
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,571
Now you're kind of
creeping me out.

1069
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,074
Okay, I guess I'll just
lay it all out there.

1070
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,369
The reason that I
brought you here tonight

1071
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,621
was because
I was thinking that

1072
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,332
maybe, perhaps,

1073
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,209
if you're interested...

1074
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,836
This is harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

1075
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,382
I wanna date you.

1076
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,092
That's what I want.

1077
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,262
Like for real.
Like a real couple.

1078
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,975
Where we, like,
go out in public and hold hands

1079
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,226
and ride bikes together.

1080
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,688
Or we, like, go to
an orchard and pick apples.

1081
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,606
Or we, like,
do one of those, like,

1082
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:12,233
Build-A-Bear
Workshops together,

1083
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,567
and we build bears,

1084
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,987
and you name one "Bumper"
and I'll name one "Fat Amy,"

1085
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,906
and yours will be bigger
than mine and it'll be cute,

1086
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:22,076
and we can put them on
our bed that we share.

1087
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,454
What do you say?

1088
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,251
No.

1089
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,586
I don't...

1090
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,214
I don't do that.

1091
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,508
Yeah, that's cool.

1092
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:38,968
It was a...
Cool.

1093
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,303
It was a stupid idea anyways.
Yeah.

1094
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:43,306
Obviously, we shouldn't do that.
We should just

1095
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,517
go back to how things
used to be

1096
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:50,354
and just go at it on top of all this
expensive food that I bought.

1097
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,564
Are you crying?

1098
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,568
Nope.

1099
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,736
No, I'm not.

1100
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,820
Bumper!

1101
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,156
Come on, you can't be serious.

1102
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:03,034
I can't be tied down
by anything.

1103
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,285
I'm on a walkabout.

1104
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,288
I'm a free-range pony
that can't be tamed.

1105
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,167
You know.

1106
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:13,210
Okay.
I'm like a firework.

1107
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,505
I can't be tied down.
Okay.

1108
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,841
Then that's it. Then I
guess that's it, right?

1109
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,719
Because I'm not gonna
keep going on like this.

1110
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,262
Well...
Fine.

1111
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,973
Fine, if that's how you feel,
then I think we're done.

1112
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:27,141
I think it's over.

1113
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,018
That's it?
That's it, then.

1114
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,647
So it's over, then.

1115
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:34,899
Fine. Then it's over.

1116
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:36,233
Fine, then.

1117
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:43,991
No!

1118
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,285
Too late. You're too late!

1119
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:47,912
I figured when we
didn't do the serenade,

1120
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,455
the back-up plan
should be to play her off.

1121
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,623
Turn around. Go back.

1122
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,416
I don't wanna
hear another peep!

1123
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:54,752
Trebles for life

1124
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,337
Benji!
I'm sorry.

1125
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,593
Hey, guys,
it's my first performance.

1126
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:05,596
Calm down.
It's just a chance for us
to rehearse for Worlds.

1127
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:08,307
As far as I can tell,
it's just for a bunch of old people.

1128
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,361
There's a full house
out there.

1129
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,071
How did we get
this gig again?

1130
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,531
They called us.

1131
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,698
You know what, guys?

1132
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,075
I know we're trying
a lot of new stuff,

1133
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,535
but I feel like
we're gonna get out there

1134
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,869
and we're gonna
feel the energy

1135
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,579
and we are just
gonna nail all of it!

1136
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,081
Sorry, these braids
are so tight.

1137
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,083
You know what?
I don't know. I don't know.

1138
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,626
I have many, many doubts,

1139
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,003
because if we fail this,
then we won't win the Worlds,

1140
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,797
and if we don't win the Worlds,
there will be no more Bellas,

1141
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:40,881
and without the Bellas,

1142
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,843
then my life
would have had no...

1143
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,388
"Malaria."

1144
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,307
"Meaning," Flo.

1145
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,476
Three, two...

1146
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:55,187
Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to Let's Talk-Appella,

1147
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,273
the portable podcast edition.

1148
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:00,860
We are following the story of the
embattled Barden Bellas

1149
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,736
on their road to redemption.

1150
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,823
Trying to crawl their way
back into the public's affection.

1151
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:08,617
And if they can just hold off

1152
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,537
showing us any more
of their genitalia,

1153
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,831
they may make it to
the World Championship.

1154
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,291
Well, I can't un-see it.

1155
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,876
It's haunted me ever since.

1156
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,085
Well, there's
a picture of it right here.

1157
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,129
No. This should not be
your screensaver, John.

1158
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,925
Stepping onto the stage,
the Barden Bellas.

1159
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,375
Whoa!
All right!

1160
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,628
This is some exciting stuff.
So sassy!

1161
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,573
Wow.
A lot going on up there.

1162
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:30,908
I think this sounds good.

1163
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,327
Honestly, my senses
are overwhelmed here, John.

1164
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,205
They might wanna
tone down the theatrics.

1165
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,623
Let's hope
there are no props.

1166
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,667
Oh, they brought
the props out, John.

1167
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,710
And there are the props.

1168
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,046
This is more of a circus act than
an a cappella performance.

1169
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,714
Gail, it's as if
the Barden Bellas

1170
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,299
just don't know
who they are anymore.

1171
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,478
Whoa!

1172
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:00,771
Look at this!

1173
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,815
She's on fire! She's on fire!

1174
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,067
Oh, my God!
I'm on fire!

1175
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,402
Now they lit
one on fire.

1176
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,529
Good day! Good heavens!
Oh.

1177
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,364
Incoming! Oh, my God,
I can't breathe!

1178
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,575
I can't breathe, girl!
Fat Amy, I can't breathe!

1179
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,828
Beating DSM seems
impossible for this team.

1180
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,913
Even these
common people can see

1181
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,666
that the Barden Bellas
have no shot at reinstatement.

1182
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,418
They are
an embarrassment

1183
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,670
to a cappella
and all that it stands for.

1184
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,299
This is what happens
when you send girls to college.

1185
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:30,092
Is it?

1186
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,060
Is that for a class?

1187
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,937
No, it's just
when I get stressed,

1188
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,342
words sort of
flow right out of me

1189
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,857
and I try and channel them
in my songwriting...

1190
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,860
Are we just gonna ignore
what happened back there?

1191
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:48,944
Guys, hello?

1192
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,738
The Worlds are
right around the corner

1193
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:53,449
and you guys are acting like we
didn't just eat a big bag of... Ahhh!

1194
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:54,617
Why are you yelling at me?

1195
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,036
I almost burned to death
because of you a-ca-bitches.

1196
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,454
If you almost died,
it was only because

1197
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,872
you were standing
in the wrong spot.

1198
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,624
No! Flo flipped into me!

1199
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,751
Sure. Blame the minority.

1200
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,629
I'm black, gay, and a woman.

1201
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,797
I'm not pointing
the finger at anybody.

1202
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,215
It was Legacy's fault.

1203
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,467
Me? Wait, I didn't...

1204
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,071
Obviously, we're not gonna
beat Das Sound Machine at their game.

1205
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,555
So we need a new plan.
Like, now.

1206
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,602
At times like these,
there's only one thing for us to do.

1207
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:24,688
Fake your own death
and flee the country.
Close.

1208
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,733
We're going on a retreat.

1209
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,779
Look, I think the retreat
will be a good thing.

1210
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,657
You girls need to bond
heading into Worlds.

1211
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:35,824
It'll be so much fun.

1212
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,118
I don't know.
No, Mom, it's bad. It's...

1213
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,621
The girls are yelling at each other.
Oh, big deal.

1214
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,581
I remember
putting your godmother,

1215
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,416
Maggie Pistol,
in a choke hold,

1216
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,710
because she insisted
that George Michael was gay.

1217
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,837
Who?
Oh.

1218
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,466
I'm just worried that
my entire Bella career

1219
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,760
will be that
one terrible performance.

1220
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:58,013
And I'll never get to solo
at Lincoln Center, you know?

1221
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,848
But you're gonna
get to go to Europe.

1222
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,935
That would have been
the highlight of my college career.

1223
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,603
And you girls can win it.

1224
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,105
You have to win it.

1225
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,982
You just made being a Bella
sound so amazing.

1226
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,776
And it is amazing.

1227
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:14,571
It's a sisterhood that is gonna
support you for the rest of your life.

1228
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,615
I know you're not feeling it,

1229
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:17,991
but you will.

1230
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,703
This won't be the end
of the Bellas.

1231
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,216
Hey, Benji.

1232
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,467
Emily!

1233
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,597
Listen, I think you're missing a word here.
What's that?

1234
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:44,309
Oh, God. No.
That's not... That isn't
what I meant. I just...

1235
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,394
I didn't think so.

1236
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,854
That's really embarrassing.
No, it looks...

1237
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:47,980
Syntax is usually my forte,

1238
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,690
so I don't know how that happened.
Well, it looks great.

1239
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,316
Thank you.
That's really sweet...

1240
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:53,694
Um...

1241
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,698
When my hands aren't
covered in glitter paint,

1242
01:07:57,866 --> 01:08:00,075
do you think maybe
we could try that again?

1243
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,912
Yeah. Sure.

1244
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,623
All right. Okay. Well...

1245
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,377
I'll look forward to that.

1246
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:11,545
Just, you know,

1247
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,590
let me know when they're clean.
That's...

1248
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:15,758
I will.
All right.

1249
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:16,925
You bet.
Okay.

1250
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,677
All right. Have a good one.

1251
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,016
Okay, girls!
Everyone, in the bus.

1252
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,059
Go, go, go!

1253
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,227
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1254
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,437
Seatbelts!

1255
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,231
Good luck, Benji!

1256
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,494
This place is sweet!

1257
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:47,414
It's nice, right?

1258
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,342
I need to find somewhere
to charge my laptop.

1259
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,408
How'd you hear
about this place?

1260
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:53,003
From yours truly.

1261
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,671
Hello, Bellas.

1262
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,048
Aubrey!

1263
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:58,342
- Aubrey!
- Aubrey!

1264
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,804
Okay, girls.

1265
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,180
Oh, wow. Hi!
You must be Emily.

1266
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,557
Hey, hey.
Hey. Hi.

1267
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,393
Welcome to
The Lodge at Fallen Leaves,

1268
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,187
where Fortune 500
companies send

1269
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,939
their employees to
build teamwork skills.

1270
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,816
You run this whole place?

1271
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,150
You know,
I realized I had a knack for

1272
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:17,444
barking orders and
bending people's will.

1273
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,613
So I made a career out of it.

1274
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,241
Which reminds me,

1275
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,992
fall in line, Bellas!

1276
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,118
She ain't changed.

1277
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,162
No slouching! No straggling!

1278
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:29,081
I see you, Jessica.

1279
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:33,460
It is with great
sorrow and regret

1280
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:37,673
that I had to watch
our once proud organization

1281
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,926
become a national disgrace!

1282
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,471
Can I have the keys
to the minibar?

1283
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:46,014
Zip it.

1284
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:50,352
The Worlds signifies
a shot at redemption.

1285
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,020
You don't have
a chance at winning

1286
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,439
until you find
your sound again.

1287
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,234
You have totally
lost your harmony!

1288
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,028
So, for the next two days,

1289
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,866
you will be doing everything
together until you regain it.

1290
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:07,160
Ladies,
get ready to be transformed.

1291
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,081
You are surrounded with
the strength of your fellow Bellas

1292
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:15,210
and the support of
a proud female tradition.

1293
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,254
And a few dozen bear traps.

1294
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,630
So don't stray too far
from the marked paths.

1295
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,883
- Okay, great, let's go!
- All right.

1296
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:23,468
Well, maybe I'll just
start with a hot shower,

1297
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,761
maybe a little foot rub.

1298
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,764
Fat Amy, there are no
guest rooms for you.

1299
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,933
Then where are we staying?

1300
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,651
I don't understand camping.

1301
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,112
We're voluntarily
living like dogs.

1302
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,407
This is the worst.

1303
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:48,327
The air we're breathing
right now is at least 90% fart.

1304
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,371
That reminds me,

1305
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:53,290
I need to see
a man about a horse.

1306
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:56,919
Oh!

1307
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:00,797
Did anyone happen to pack
a spare roll of toilet paper?

1308
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,674
- Or a moist towelette?
- Nope.

1309
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:06,261
Anyone have a T-shirt,
size extra-small?

1310
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,348
Okay.
Side of the tent it is.

1311
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,020
What are we doing here?

1312
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,229
We're bonding.

1313
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,273
You seem so tense.
Do you need a back rub?

1314
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,609
Several body parts are
rubbing my back right now, thank you.

1315
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,110
You know, Beca,
we're very close,

1316
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,862
but I feel like this retreat
is really gonna let us

1317
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:25,614
discover everything
about each other.

1318
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:26,698
Is that right?

1319
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,534
You know,
one of my biggest regrets

1320
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,329
is that I didn't do enough
experimenting in college.

1321
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,039
You're so weird.

1322
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,207
Thanks.

1323
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,833
I wanna go home.

1324
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,799
I hope the sun never comes up.

1325
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,303
Why do I get
the travel pillow?

1326
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,555
Were you touching my goodies?

1327
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:52,849
Yes.

1328
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,146
Oh, guys,
I've got a little...
It won't...

1329
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,482
I just need some
help getting it out.

1330
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,234
Can you sing something?

1331
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,236
The pipe's a bit blocked.

1332
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:09,700
Thanks, Chloe.

1333
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,205
What kind of
white shit is this?

1334
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,335
Coming out
like froyo now.

1335
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,847
Up and at 'em, Bellas!
Come on! Let's go!

1336
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:34,516
Let's go!
Let's wake up!
Let's do this!

1337
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,268
Come on!
Pick up the pace, girls!

1338
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:37,436
Come on!

1339
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,980
Today we are going
back to the basics

1340
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,523
to re-learn how
to sing as a group,

1341
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,818
while also enduring death-defying
team-building trust exercises.

1342
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,111
What a great idea!

1343
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,405
Okay, so let's begin.

1344
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:55,162
Come on.

1345
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:15,432
Trust your team!

1346
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,296
- Careful, Fat Amy!
- Turn me over!

1347
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,105
Come on, lunch!

1348
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:36,203
She says
she's Asian Jesus.

1349
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:24,876
Great.

1350
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,547
Okay, that was two steps away
from being almost fine.

1351
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,006
Sorry, what are we doing?

1352
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,134
We're rediscovering
our sound.

1353
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:33,218
Are we?

1354
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:34,845
'Cause it feels like
we're just singing songs

1355
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,221
that would
never go in our set.

1356
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,389
Beca, come on.

1357
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,057
No, none of us know
how to beat Das Sound Machine,

1358
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,976
but I know it's not
gonna be by doing this.

1359
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,895
This is just an exercise
in finding harmony, Beca.

1360
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,772
Sometimes you have
to break things down

1361
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:46,898
before you can build
them back up again.

1362
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,151
I've got more important
things to do!

1363
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,819
What could be more
important than this?

1364
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,195
Nothing. Forget it.

1365
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,322
No, you don't think
that we haven't all realized

1366
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,991
you've been a little
checked-out lately?

1367
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,534
Come on, Beca, just tell her.

1368
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:58,910
I heard that.

1369
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,162
Tell me what?

1370
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,914
Oh, you misunderstood me.
I clearly said...

1371
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,503
Listen, I don't
want you guys to fight.

1372
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:11,339
You're Beca and Chloe.
Together you're "Bloe."

1373
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,049
And everyone
loves a good bloe.

1374
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:14,843
So...

1375
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,178
Okay.

1376
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,346
I've been interning
at a recording studio

1377
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,015
and a legit music producer
wants to hear my work.

1378
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:22,100
God forbid I have something
going on outside this group.

1379
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,185
Okay.

1380
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,145
So why would you keep
something like that from us?

1381
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,022
'Cause you're obsessed!
You all are.

1382
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,690
We're graduating,
and the only person

1383
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,650
thinking about life
after the Bellas is me.

1384
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,111
What is so wrong
with being focused on the Bellas?

1385
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:35,614
This has been my family
for seven years.

1386
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,508
Yeah, 'cause you're
too scared to leave!

1387
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,700
Sack up, dude!

1388
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,035
Girl fight!

1389
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,454
Okay, so you've been lying
to us for the entire year

1390
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,538
and now you're
just gonna flake out?

1391
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:44,873
Now you're
gonna flake out when

1392
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,333
the Worlds is, like,
right after graduation?

1393
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,793
Oh, my God!
Enough about the Worlds! I...

1394
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,170
I'm out of here.

1395
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:51,546
Oh, okay, you're just
gonna leave now?

1396
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:52,714
We all have to,
eventually, Chloe!

1397
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,382
It might as well be now!

1398
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,508
Wait, Beca...

1399
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,093
If you all knew what was good for you,
you'd follow me.

1400
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,428
Beca, the sign!

1401
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,556
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1402
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:02,682
Oh, no, Beca! Beca!

1403
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,726
What the hell?
I'm stuck!

1404
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,853
I'm stuck! I'm seeing spots!
I'm seeing spots!

1405
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:08,730
Well, well, well.

1406
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,232
Look who needs our help.

1407
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,733
Not cool, guys!

1408
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:15,237
No, what's not cool is you
taking out your frustrations on us!

1409
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,239
Really? That's what you're
gonna say to me right now?

1410
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,491
Help me! I'm dying! I'm dying!

1411
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,246
We need to get her down!
We need a ladder!

1412
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,705
No, we don't believe in ladders.
What?

1413
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,207
They suggest
a corporate hierarchy

1414
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,451
that is counter-productive
to my team-building program.

1415
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,379
What kind of operation
are you running here?

1416
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:35,382
Seriously, this whole place is, like,
full of booby traps!

1417
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:36,591
And guess what?

1418
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:38,969
Boobs should
never be trapped!

1419
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,846
Unless it's for support
if you have lower back issues.

1420
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,599
Okay! If I'm about
to die, I'm sorry!

1421
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,268
I didn't mean
any of that stuff I said!

1422
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,103
I love all of you!
I love all of you awesome nerds,

1423
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,867
- and I love being a Bella.
- I'm just so stressed out right now...

1424
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:52,607
Oh, my God!
Oh, my gosh!

1425
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:55,485
Jessica and Ashley, I don't actually
know which one of you is which.

1426
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,112
I'm Jessica!
I'm Jessica!

1427
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,489
Don't worry, we're gonna get you down!
Focus up.

1428
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,283
Get in formation,
we can do this. Flo, get up.
Okay.

1429
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:02,575
- Fat Amy, come on!
- Yes!

1430
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,786
Let's focus.
Work together as a team.

1431
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:05,996
Don't worry, Beca, we got...

1432
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:12,585
She's alive.

1433
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,381
I sleep upside
down like a bat.

1434
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,432
It's just everything's
changing so fast

1435
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:28,059
and I'm putting all this
pressure on myself, you know?

1436
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,728
I don't wanna fail.

1437
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,532
But if you just would
have said something...

1438
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:34,274
Yeah, I know. But I'm
weird about that stuff.

1439
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:37,277
I thought I could figure it out on my own,
and I can't.

1440
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:40,655
Maybe I don't have
anything original to say.

1441
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:43,491
I wish I could do what you do.

1442
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,162
Well, I feel
the same way about you.

1443
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,581
You're so good,
it's intimidating.

1444
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:53,168
All I've ever wanted
is to be one of you.

1445
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,254
Not a Legacy, but a Bella.

1446
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,381
You are a real Bella.
Of course you're a Bella.

1447
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:01,593
You are one of us.
You paid the registration fee.

1448
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,429
That's for life, dude.

1449
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,099
Do you wanna
collaborate on something?

1450
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:11,936
Wait. Are you being serious?

1451
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,605
Yeah.

1452
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,273
Yeah!

1453
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,441
Wow!

1454
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,612
Man! Yes! Who else feels
like a winner tonight?

1455
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,701
I know it
doesn't seem like it,

1456
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,453
but I'm afraid, too.

1457
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,414
To move on, to graduate.

1458
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,875
It's really scary.

1459
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:36,044
Yeah, it actually
does seem like it,

1460
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,046
because you're barely
holding it together.

1461
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,799
Well, it doesn't
have to be scary, Chloe.

1462
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,468
When I was graduating,
I never pictured myself

1463
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:47,138
running a retreat in
the middle of the woods,

1464
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,099
but here I am.

1465
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:54,062
Take it from someone who has
dealt with some serious control issues.

1466
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,232
Like my dad always said,

1467
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,651
in the minefield of life,

1468
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,154
you must be prepared
to lose both feet.

1469
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,741
And I think you all know
what I mean.

1470
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,326
I don't.

1471
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,453
Then it's decided.

1472
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,664
This year I will graduate.

1473
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,125
The Worlds will
be my swan song.

1474
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,961
I mean it.
I'll pursue my passion.

1475
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:20,338
I'll teach underprivileged
children how to sing,

1476
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,340
or I'll dance exotically.

1477
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,926
Whatever offers
the most money.

1478
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:28,638
Yo, check this out.

1479
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:31,182
I'm moving to Maine
to get hitched.

1480
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:32,559
And all y'all can come.

1481
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,227
Everybody's invited.

1482
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,438
Yes, yes, yes.

1483
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:41,192
Okay, okay, guys.
Stop asking. I'll tell you.

1484
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:46,281
So, after I graduate there's a chance
I will be deported.

1485
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:48,366
I will try to
re-enter this country,

1486
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,368
but I will
probably die at sea.

1487
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,455
So, let's live for tonight!
Yes!

1488
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:54,706
Yeah!

1489
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,583
- Yes!
- All right.

1490
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,419
Lilly, any plans?

1491
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,213
Just gonna
travel through time.

1492
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,343
You know,
when I look back on this,

1493
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,554
I won't remember
performing and competing.

1494
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,264
I'm gonna remember
you weirdos.

1495
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,142
It makes me
really sad to think

1496
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,060
it won't ever be
like this again.

1497
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,480
I'm gonna miss you guys.

1498
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,732
Me, too.
Me, too.

1499
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,109
Yeah. Me, too.

1500
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:19,791
Did we just find our sound?

1501
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,751
I think we did.

1502
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:25,755
My work here is done.

1503
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,424
Thank you.

1504
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:32,554
Fat Amy, you never told us what
you were gonna do after graduation.

1505
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:33,638
Oh. Well...

1506
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:34,889
Mmm.

1507
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,724
No, I don't have any plans.

1508
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:40,144
'Cause you guys know me,
I just love living in the moment.

1509
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,230
Ashley, what are
you gonna do after...

1510
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,314
Actually, though,

1511
01:21:43,983 --> 01:21:45,900
if we were to stop
and really think,

1512
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,945
"What could Fat Amy
be capable of in the future?"

1513
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,822
I'll tell you guys.

1514
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:54,617
I'd be living somewhere,
like, sick, like Tulsa or Little Rock.

1515
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,998
By day, I'm a professional
jelly wrestler for corporate events.

1516
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,458
And then, every night,

1517
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:06,462
it's just me cuddled up
with my fiancé, Bumper, and...

1518
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:08,673
Oh, wait.

1519
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,761
I'm in love with Bumper.

1520
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:14,846
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.

1521
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:17,849
Okay, I've done
something terrible,

1522
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:21,269
and I'm not talking about
crop-dusting Chloe and Beca right now.

1523
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:22,604
Apologize for that.

1524
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,940
You guys,
I need to go right now.

1525
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:27,942
And I need to
win back my man!

1526
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,611
Screw your judgments!

1527
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,530
Go get him, Fat Amy!

1528
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:37,869
Guys, what happened?

1529
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:39,203
Shake it off, Amy.

1530
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,371
That was bad.

1531
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,206
Somebody bring a s'more.

1532
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,876
I give you
our next album cover.

1533
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:46,377
Look at him!

1534
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:48,463
I did it all myself today.

1535
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,465
Now, I know that I
only have one vote...

1536
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,258
You got no votes, man.
You're not in the group, so...

1537
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:53,635
Okay, well,
that hurts my feelings.

1538
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:54,802
It's just the truth,
is the thing.

1539
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,007
Well, that hurts
my feelings.

1540
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:58,973
With my vote,
I vote "no" to the pig

1541
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,351
and "yes" to
this gloriousness.

1542
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:03,395
Yeah, it's great.
We'll put it to a vote later.
No.

1543
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,229
Bumper, I'm coming!

1544
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,813
Nope! Turn it around!

1545
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,159
I don't wanna see you!

1546
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,253
Whew. Really misjudged
the size of this lake.

1547
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:12,588
Why didn't she just
walk around the lake?

1548
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,298
Fat Amy doesn't
do anything small.

1549
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,551
Yes, I've been using
my shower shoes.

1550
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,469
Okay, I love you, too.
Here she is.

1551
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,765
What up, Mrs. Junk?

1552
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,325
Go!

1553
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:45,747
Well, what are you doing?

1554
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,249
I'm soloing, here!

1555
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,168
Whatever!

1556
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:01,804
No!

1557
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:07,245
Well, all right.

1558
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:12,542
All right, let's go.
Into the house.

1559
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:14,669
Give me that neck.

1560
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:17,713
I mean, we can do...
Do you want it...

1561
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,508
Do you feel like you'd
want to layer a bunch of voices?

1562
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:24,512
I think in the beginning
it could definitely build.

1563
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,430
I think it starts
out light, though.

1564
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,683
Get your cute butt
in the studio, then.

1565
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,685
Don't tell my boss that
we were in here, by the way.

1566
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,144
I got all I need
when I got you and I

1567
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:35,690
'Cause I look around me
and see a sweet life

1568
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,108
This is... Wow!

1569
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,694
It's the real deal.

1570
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:40,945
Yeah, don't touch
anything, Legacy.

1571
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,673
You're very pretty,
but you seem clumsy.

1572
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:44,407
Great.

1573
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:45,575
Okay.

1574
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,286
Can't lie
it's a sweet life

1575
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:52,707
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

1576
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,668
You're getting me
Getting me through the night

1577
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:00,089
You're my flashlight

1578
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:03,593
You're my flashlight

1579
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:07,305
You're my flashlight

1580
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:15,146
Okay, so you produced this?

1581
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,939
Uh, yes. Emily wrote it.

1582
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:18,816
Mmm-hmm. Who's Emily?
I am.

1583
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,485
This tall drink of water,
right there. Hey. Emily.

1584
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,112
Well...

1585
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,239
Um...

1586
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,325
I don't... I don't...
I don't like it.

1587
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:32,246
What it is, is I don't like it when
people can do what I can do.

1588
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,583
You know, in a manner of speaking,
it's threatening.

1589
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:38,002
But, you just did it.

1590
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,671
And I have a...

1591
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:44,634
I have a few notes
that I assume that you're open to.

1592
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:46,802
Yes.
Um, but this is a solid demo,

1593
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:48,930
with real potential.

1594
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:52,016
Yeah, I look forward
to working together.

1595
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,225
It's nice to meet you.

1596
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,019
What is it? Elizabeth?
Emily.

1597
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:56,270
Emily.
Elizabeth? What?

1598
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:58,356
Emily. Thank you.
Thank you.

1599
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,858
Oh.
I gotta jump on a call.

1600
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:03,611
Yeah, no.
No, get it in there.
Get it in there. Attagirl.

1601
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:04,987
You want one of these?
Oh, hey.

1602
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:07,114
You want one of those?
There you go. Attagirl. Ow!

1603
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:08,824
Good job, Reggie.

1604
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:10,201
I'm Reggie.

1605
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,954
Oh, my God, I was so nervous
I didn't know what to say!

1606
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,246
Oh, my God!

1607
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,373
You're all sweaty.

1608
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:16,874
We're gonna be late!

1609
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:18,709
We're taking the photo
with or without you.

1610
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,170
We're taking the photo
with or without you!

1611
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:23,673
Everybody get together.
No, no, no, together.

1612
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,718
One, two, three!
Bellas for life!

1613
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,074
Okay. So, is there
a restaurant in this town

1614
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,325
that serves
something other than fish?

1615
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,827
I did see a KFC back there.

1616
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,161
Nope. All fish. I checked.

1617
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,414
Guys, over here.
Come this way.

1618
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,499
Oh, Chloe,
I'm coming for ya!

1619
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:03,587
Whoo-hoo. College graduates!
- Spreading my wings, y'all!

1620
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,173
There are so many
fresh Danishes here.

1621
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,551
I swear, if I wasn't
recently locked down,

1622
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,095
I would tear a hole
through this city!

1623
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,056
This place is so
smelly and rainy.

1624
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:16,392
Why do Americans
ever leave America?

1625
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,020
Culture, design, history.

1626
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,440
I'm not
copen-hating this place.

1627
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:23,607
I'm starving.

1628
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:26,277
Yeah, why don't we go visit
Hayden Christian Andersen's house?

1629
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:30,072
That guy? But he was pretty crap
in the Star Wars prequels.

1630
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:39,623
Well, here we are.

1631
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,834
Do you think the stage is big
enough for what we want to do?

1632
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:44,420
You're kidding, right?
It's huge.

1633
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:46,088
You guys think it'll work?

1634
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:48,674
It'll work for us.
That's what matters.

1635
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,260
Let's go!

1636
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,473
Let's do this thing!

1637
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:57,433
Whoo!

1638
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:59,042
Everyone knows
where to meet, right?

1639
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,312
Yeah, we know.

1640
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,481
All right.
Safety first, Flo.

1641
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,634
Here it is, folks.
The granddaddy of them all.

1642
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:34,386
The World Championship
of A Cappella!

1643
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:36,806
Tonight, groups from
around the globe duke it out

1644
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,849
for the title of
A-ca World Champion.

1645
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:42,686
And, of course,
representing America,
the embattled Barden Bellas.

1646
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:46,398
The Bellas, making one last attempt
to repair a damaged legacy

1647
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:49,193
by becoming the first American
team to claim the title.

1648
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,402
Can they do it, John?

1649
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,530
Theoretically, yes, Gail.

1650
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:56,200
Realistically, absolutely not.
Those girls are dead to me.

1651
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,494
So many countries
represented here tonight, John.

1652
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:01,705
We saw in rehearsal
an incredible group from the Philippines.

1653
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:03,040
What were they called?

1654
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,667
"The Ladyboys."

1655
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,502
That wasn't the name of the group,
I don't think.

1656
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,045
I think that's how
they described themselves.

1657
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:09,839
That's right.
They're "Manila Envy."

1658
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:10,923
Manila Envy.

1659
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:12,466
You know,
I spent some time with

1660
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:15,469
some ladyboys, uh,
in the Philippines myself.

1661
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:16,554
Not surprising.

1662
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,597
Very interesting young men.

1663
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:20,725
Doing amazing things
with their mouths, I presume.

1664
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,894
When we go back to the stage,
I'll do a few for you here.

1665
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:26,397
Uh, you know,
we can get to it, I think.
Okay.

1666
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,321
You know, maybe when
the Koreans are out there,

1667
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,776
because no one cares
about the Korean group.

1668
01:31:30,861 --> 01:31:32,528
Love that barbeque.

1669
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:40,953
What are you doing here?

1670
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,121
Oh, you...

1671
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:44,415
You know, anything
to support the Bellas.

1672
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:45,875
Wow. I...

1673
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,753
Now I'm the one
who can't speak.

1674
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:52,131
I'm just so
freaking nervous.

1675
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:53,215
Oh, my God. Don't be.

1676
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:54,425
You'll be great.

1677
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:56,594
I mean, we heard you guys rehearsing,
like, 24/7.

1678
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,597
So I'll... I should
probably go find my seat.

1679
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:01,473
Yeah.

1680
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,767
But before I go, I just...

1681
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:05,603
I have something for you.

1682
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,524
Oh...

1683
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,031
I'm so sorry. I thought that
that was going in a different direction.

1684
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:19,033
- That's my bad.
- No, no, I liked it.

1685
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,117
Em, you ready?

1686
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:23,621
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll be right there.

1687
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,289
Benji.

1688
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,083
Okay. Well, break a leg.

1689
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,715
DSM! Ja!
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1690
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:13,897
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1691
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:16,900
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1692
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:18,569
DSM! Ja!

1693
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:29,747
- Ooh!
- Well done!

1694
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:33,167
There they go,
the Indian group,
the Naan-Stops,

1695
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:36,337
running off stage to
take a few more of our jobs.

1696
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:38,464
I thought
the little one was spicy!

1697
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:44,053
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1698
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:46,221
And coming up next,
Das Sound Machine.

1699
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,431
A crowd favorite, John.

1700
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,684
DSM! Ja!
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

1701
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:51,769
Hear that?

1702
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:54,480
They chant. For us.

1703
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,483
Now, don't cry too hard
when you lose, huh?

1704
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,151
Makes eyes puffy.

1705
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:00,903
Your hands are so soft.

1706
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:03,447
I'm sorry,
I don't speak "loser."
What did you say?

1707
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:05,449
She actually speaks
eight languages,

1708
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:07,368
but "loser" is
not one of them.

1709
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,078
Everything must
come to an end.

1710
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:10,454
Even the Bellas.

1711
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,914
Take care
and lose nice.

1712
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,667
Huh, your sweat
smells like cinnamon.

1713
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:16,752
Damn it!

1714
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:27,137
...Das Sound Machine!

1715
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,237
DSM!

1716
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:33,889
They've got
the crowd going wild!

1717
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:35,140
Okay, shake it off.

1718
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:38,143
DSM! DSM!

1719
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:39,478
Das Sound Machine.

1720
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:42,898
An incredible performance
once again from the German group.

1721
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,358
I'm telling you, Gail, though,

1722
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:46,360
if the Bellas of old
show up tonight,

1723
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,530
this could be the most
significant conflict

1724
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:52,658
between America and
Germany in history.

1725
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:54,117
Crack a book, John.

1726
01:37:57,956 --> 01:38:01,083
Pass one down to your friends.
Here you go. Thank you.

1727
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:02,834
All right, here you go, buddy.

1728
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:04,086
Thanks, man.

1729
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,504
Where have you been?

1730
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:07,631
You have no idea, dude.

1731
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:09,299
Final performance, guys.

1732
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:11,802
We need to get out there
and beat DSM.

1733
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,096
This one's for us.

1734
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:16,223
Guys, there's gonna be
some haters out there.

1735
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:19,726
They're gonna
look at us, Team USA,

1736
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:22,646
and be like, "Why is the most
talented one Australian?"

1737
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:27,442
Well, guess what. I am fat.
So that is close enough.

1738
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:30,904
We are gonna show them
who we are.

1739
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:33,073
A bunch of ethnically diverse,

1740
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:35,325
for the most part feminine,

1741
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:37,452
amazing singers!

1742
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:38,579
Yeah!

1743
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:40,372
Let's just go out there
and ac' the world!

1744
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:41,582
Yes!

1745
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:42,833
Yeah!
Yes!

1746
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:45,002
John, it's possible
we are watching

1747
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:47,045
the last hurrah
of the Barden Bellas.

1748
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,256
It's going to be very
hard to pull this off,

1749
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,841
and if they don't,

1750
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:54,094
they are out of business
as an a cappella group.

1751
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,262
It is over.

1752
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,140
All right! Let's do this!

1753
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,685
...Barden University's Bellas!

1754
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,897
Yes!
Whoo!

1755
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:07,316
That's my girl!

1756
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:08,984
Beca!

1757
01:41:16,154 --> 01:41:17,904
When tomorrow comes

1758
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:19,322
I'll be on my own

1759
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:22,492
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know

1760
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,161
When tomorrow comes

1761
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,787
When tomorrow comes

1762
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:27,664
When tomorrow comes

1763
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:28,999
When tomorrow comes

1764
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:31,918
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky

1765
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,713
Is it possible
the Barden Bellas

1766
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:36,840
are doing an original song?

1767
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:38,592
Then I sing along

1768
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,343
Then I sing along

1769
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,262
Then I sing along

1770
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:45,265
I got all I need
when I got you and I

1771
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:48,351
'Cause I look around me
and see your sweet life

1772
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:51,521
I'm stuck in the darkness
You're my flashlight

1773
01:41:51,689 --> 01:41:54,524
You're gettin' me gettin' me
through the night

1774
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:57,819
You kick start my heart
when you shine it in my eyes

1775
01:41:57,987 --> 01:41:59,154
I can't lie

1776
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:00,947
It's a sweet life

1777
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:04,159
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

1778
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:06,953
You're gettin' me
through the night

1779
01:42:13,503 --> 01:42:14,503
Look at this!

1780
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:16,296
It looks like
the Barden Bellas are being

1781
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,965
joined on stage by
generations of Bellas,

1782
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:21,051
going all the way
back to the beginning.

1783
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:22,969
'Cause you're my flashlight

1784
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:24,137
'Cause you're my flashlight

1785
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:25,806
'Cause you're my flashlight

1786
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,349
'Cause you're my flashlight

1787
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:29,309
You're my flashlight

1788
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:32,395
You're gettin' me
through the night

1789
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:35,232
I got all I need
when I got you and I

1790
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:38,401
'Cause I look around me
and see your sweet life

1791
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:41,571
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

1792
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:44,699
You're getting me
through the night

1793
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:47,911
Kick start my heart
when you shine it in my eyes

1794
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,081
I can't lie
It's a sweet life

1795
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:54,042
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

1796
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:56,211
You're gettin' me
through the night

1797
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:58,255
We belong

1798
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,006
'Cause you're my flashlight

1799
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:01,424
'Cause you are

1800
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,093
'Cause you're my flashlight

1801
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:04,761
'Cause you're my flashlight

1802
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:06,596
I'm your flashlight

1803
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:09,599
You're gettin' me
through the night

1804
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:13,979
'Cause you're my flashlight

1805
01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:16,231
'Cause you're my

1806
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:21,152
Gettin' me through the

1807
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,780
Night

1808
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,160
Whoo!

1809
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:44,175
"Simple," "raw,"
"vulnerable," "exposed."

1810
01:43:44,343 --> 01:43:47,596
I've been called a lot of things, Gail.
But let me add one more.

1811
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:48,889
I'm impressed.

1812
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,974
I thought you were
gonna say "gay."

1813
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:52,475
Emily!
Yeah!

1814
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:54,185
Emily!

1815
01:43:54,353 --> 01:43:56,521
Emily! Emily!

1816
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:00,775
Whoo! Whoo!

1817
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:03,778
Bellas! Bellas! Bellas!

1818
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:10,660
Bellas! Bellas! Bellas!

1819
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:14,039
Oh. They have touched
every person here.

1820
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:16,291
They've touched me, John.

1821
01:44:16,459 --> 01:44:18,710
Well, everyone has
touched you, Gail,

1822
01:44:18,878 --> 01:44:21,004
but this is something else.

1823
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:40,607
It's ceremonial,

1824
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,025
and you should
definitely not drink it

1825
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,610
'cause it is
essentially poison.

1826
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:44,903
Terrible for you.
Okay.

1827
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:46,363
Okay.
Great.

1828
01:44:47,365 --> 01:44:49,824
Ooh. It smells like
cherries and vanilla.

1829
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,034
Okay, repeat after me.

1830
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:52,869
"I..." Sing your name.

1831
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,329
I...

1832
01:44:54,372 --> 01:44:55,455
Emily...

1833
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:56,665
Okay.

1834
01:44:56,749 --> 01:44:59,668
"Promise to uphold the ideals
of a Bella woman forever."

1835
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:02,379
Promise to uphold the ideals
of a Bella woman forever.

1836
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:04,089
And that's it.
That's the end of the speech.

1837
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,549
Nothing weird
happens after that.

1838
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:07,884
These are for you.

1839
01:45:08,052 --> 01:45:09,572
Don't go in the basement,
it's haunted.

1840
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:11,054
Wait!

1841
01:45:11,097 --> 01:45:12,472
One last thing.

1842
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:14,516
Yes, every Bella
must christen the house

1843
01:45:14,684 --> 01:45:16,393
by sliding down the staircase.

1844
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:19,187
Seriously?

1845
01:45:19,355 --> 01:45:20,939
It's tradition.
Yeah.

1846
01:45:21,107 --> 01:45:23,066
Don't worry. I'll show you.

1847
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:27,195
Behold!

1848
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:37,080
Crushed it.

1849
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,581
Good form.

1850
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:41,251
Now I'm ready to move on.

1851
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:44,254
Legacy, you're up.

1852
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:49,342
All right, I'm ready.

1853
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:51,428
Let's do this!

1854
01:48:25,207 --> 01:48:26,207
Yes!

1855
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:35,008
You can't!

1856
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:38,094
You can't turn back around.
That's not part of the rules!
That's not...

1857
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:39,762
That bad?

1858
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:50,893
Thank you so much, Pharrell.

1859
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:01,784
Adam, turn around!

1860
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:04,120
Everybody's doing it, baby!
They love me!

1861
01:49:04,288 --> 01:49:06,456
America loves me!

1862
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,342
And I give myself to you!

1863
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:20,011
And you! And you! And you!

1864
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:21,512
And you, America!

1865
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,390
Whoo!

1866
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:31,940
- Hey, man.
- Yes. Yes, Blake.

1867
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:33,149
What's your name, brother?

1868
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:36,069
I don't even know right now!

1869
01:49:36,153 --> 01:49:37,403
Hey, just do me a favor, man.

1870
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:41,366
Please,
under no circumstances,
choose me for your coach.

1871
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:43,618
I just want to put that out there.
Okay.

1872
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:47,163
So, you have a lot of personality.
And I love that.

1873
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:48,790
Thank you.

1874
01:49:48,958 --> 01:49:51,834
You're interesting,
and I can work with interesting.

1875
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:56,673
All of the coaches
at my disposal,

1876
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,259
I'm gonna have to choose

1877
01:49:59,343 --> 01:50:00,343
Christina!

1878
01:50:00,928 --> 01:50:01,928
Whoo!

1879
01:50:03,013 --> 01:50:04,013
Yay!

1880
01:50:05,307 --> 01:50:06,391
This is awesome!

1881
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:07,600
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

1882
01:50:07,685 --> 01:50:09,060
Oh, my God.

1883
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:11,562
Whoa! Okay, okay, okay.

1884
01:50:11,647 --> 01:50:13,189
Thank you.
Okay.

1885
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:15,566
Thank you so much.

1886
01:50:15,818 --> 01:50:17,735
Aah! Besties!

1887
01:50:17,903 --> 01:50:19,988
Hey, Mom! Hey.

1888
01:50:20,155 --> 01:50:21,531
Hey, Amy!
