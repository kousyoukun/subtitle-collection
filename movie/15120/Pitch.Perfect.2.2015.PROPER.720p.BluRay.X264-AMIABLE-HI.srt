Welcome back, a cappella enthusiasts.

My name is John Smith,

and sitting here to my left

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,340
is Gail Abernathy-McCadden-Feinberger.

Oh, this one's gonna stick, John.

We are coming to you live

every single barrier in their path,
haven't they, Gail?

and now, here they are,

of the United States on his birthday.

earned her green card, John.

She may have to do that backflip

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,563
right back over the fence into Mexico.

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,060

Happy birthday, Mr. President.

The Australian singer
who calls herself "Fat Amy"

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,900
gave the President a birthday gift
from down under

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,580
during last night's celebration held
at the historic Kennedy Center.

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,580
In case you're wondering what I mean
by "down under," Chip,

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,140
I'm talking about her... (BLEEP).

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,527
She showed her... (BLEEP)
to the President.

70
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,660
All eyes were on the a cappella
singers, the Barden Bellas.

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,060
...three-time defending
a cappella national champions,

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,820
which is a real thing, apparently.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,580
Although authorities have ruled out
terrorism as a motive,

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,580
the Bellas claim the mishap
was merely an accident

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,045
and issued an apology.

76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,060
I am deeply sorry for the upset
that I have caused.

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,260
I feel that I have already received
punishment enough

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,620
in the form of silk burn.

79

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,260
No, no, no!

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,361
It's filth.

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,460
Women who sing are just another example

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,820
of cultural decay, due to loose morals.

84
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,160
Not wearing underwear

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,940
- seems kind of intentional to me.
- Mmm.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,500
Yeah, you either choose to wear underwear,
or you don't wear underwear.

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,180
It's a choice I make every day.

88
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,740
You know, until today,
I thought singing a cappella

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,081
was the most embarrassing thing
you could do.

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,930
Normally, that group is on point,

91
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,620
and last night, they were off-point,

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,060
off-key, and then on the floor.

93
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,220
It's a national disgrace.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,220
Yeah, but I'd rather be in that
limo ride home with the President.

95
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,860
Cut to the real President, he'd be like,

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,962
- "That... (BLEEP) was off the hook!"
- (LAUGHTER)

Chloe, chill out. It was a mistake.

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,340
They're not gonna
burn us for witchcraft.

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,500
No, but the National
A Cappella Association

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,281
is in there talking to the dean about us,
and who knows what's gonna happen?

102
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,020
We won three championships.

103
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,963
Whatever happens in there,
we're gonna be fine.

104
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,606
Maybe it's time to
think about other stuff.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,020
What other stuff?

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,260
You know, school, jobs, life.

107
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,420
This group is my life.

108
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,540
I've intentionally failed
Russian Lit three times

109
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,980
so I could be a Bella.

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,811
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to us. Ever.

111
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,500
You know, before coming to Barden,

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,728
I had diarrhea for seven years.

113
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,124
But yes, this is terrible.

114
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,005
The dean is ready for you tramps.

115
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,641
STACIE: Oh, jeez.

116
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,521
Ladies,

117
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,420
you have dragged the good name

118
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,251
of Barden University into the gutter.

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,482
And you've really upset these people

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,570
whose names I've already forgotten.

121
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,980
Your little southern exposure
in front of our Commander-in-Chief

122
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,900
has irreparably damaged
the entire institution of a cappella.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,060
Just blew it up.

124
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,083
Funding is drying up,
sponsors are pulling out.

125
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,940
- GAIL: Mmm-hmm.
- JOHN: Unfortunately, an example must be made.

126
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,220
It is the decision
of this governing body

127
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,403
that the Bellas are hereby suspended

128
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,249
- from competing at the collegiate level.
- JESSICA: What?

129
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,580
The terms of your suspension
are laid out in this document.

130
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,940
- I'm sorry, but it's over.
- Hi.

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,740
Okay, can we be reasonable?

132
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,260
Fat Amy apologized.
This was an accident.

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,460
- Was it?
- (CHLOE GASPS)

134
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,847
You're taking us off
of our victory tour?

135
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,460
Who's gonna sing the national anthem
at the Puppy Bowl?

136
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,420
You're being replaced
by the European champions.

137
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,100
A German group of total professionals.

138
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,100
In other words, they're gonna
keep their pants on.

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,601
So we can't defend our title
and we can't tour?

140
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,380
DEAN: And you can't hold any auditions.

141
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,380
We don't need your ranks
to grow like a fungus.

142
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,620
CHLOE: Oh, so that's it, then?

143
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,660
So, basically, the Bellas are over?

144
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,740
JOHN: Look, ladies,

145
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,561
I'm sorry that this disciplinary action
has shocked you.

146
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,540
Especially since you're all seniors.

147
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,940
But the truth is, you're just women.

148
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,280
No.

149
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,289
- And you'll all be pregnant soon.
- Mmm.

EMILY: Mom, I'm late.

151
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,561
It's orientation. You gotta let me go.

152
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,300
Oh, I can't.

153
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,420
I just can't do it.

154
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,460
Mom, you can do it.

155
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,530
My only daughter, leaving the nest.

156
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,411
(SINGING) If you leave me now

157
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,460
You'll take away the biggest part of me

158
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,060
- Mom.
- You want me to stop?

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,420
(SINGING) Or I could keep singing!

160
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,220
No, I don't know how I'm gonna get by
without your spontaneous singing.

161
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,687
Oh, honey, you're gonna love this place.

162
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,845
Just promise you'll call.

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,209
Oh, and, honey, don't be afraid
to express yourself.

164
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,891
And not with those weird buttons
they wear in their earlobes.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,580
- Unless you're gonna get a job...
- Mom, slow down.

166
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,460
I'm not gonna do anything crazy.

167
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm just gonna write my songs
and join an a cappella group.

168
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,446
Not just any a cappella group.

169
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,526
The Bellas are an institution.

170
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,020
My days as a Bella were the best...

171
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,620
Best days of your life.

172
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,371
I know. And I can't wait to be one.

173
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,820
Unless they don't take me, Mom.

174
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,060
Oh, no, honey, they're gonna take you.

175
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,640
Thanks to me, you were born into it.

176
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,530
And then I'm gonna be your mother...

177
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,286
(SINGING) And your sister

178
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,885
Gross. Okay.

179
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,526
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

180
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,806
All right, the next phase of my life

181
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,646
begins.

182
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,801
CHLOE: Hold on.

183
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,540
There is nothing in here
that strips us of our national title.

184
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,380
And if we're still reigning champs,

185
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,860
then we are automatically invited
to represent America

186
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,420
at the World Championships this spring.

187
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,060
Ah, yes, the World
Championships of A Cappella,

188
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,460
where, every four years,

189
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,580
groups from around the globe compete
for world domination.

190
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,260
I'm sorry. I just feel like I always
have to be on, you know.

191
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,725
JOHN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, look, ladies,

192
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,220
we can't stop you from going
to the Worlds competition.

193
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,900
It's not gonna help your case here.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,020
GAIL: Not at all.

195
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,220
What if we win it?

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,321
JOHN: What if you win it?

197

- (SCOFFS)
- Like, you...

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002
You out-perform the other groups?

in such a small body?

201
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,685

What if you win it?

206
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,780
- Yeah. If we win, will you reinstate us?
- GAIL: Sure.

207
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,884
But no American team has ever won.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,300
That's because they hate us.

209
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,765
The whole world.

210
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,100
The whole world hates us.

Hate us.

Okay, get off the stage.
No one cares about you. All right.

217
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,761
You have made a great choice,
and a cheap one.

218

Yay, Barden!

We are the Treblemakers.

I'm Jesse, and this is a cappella.

- Oh, my God!

You're a ginger.
That's punishment enough.

240

This is not all your fault.
This is on all of us.

241

So, if we don't win the Worlds,
then what are we?

00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,100
Just a bunch of girls that hang out?

- (CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

245

This is the biggest challenge
that any of us have ever faced.

246
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,620
When I was nine years old, my brother
tried to sell me for a chicken, so...

247
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,620
Well, I will do whoever it takes
in order for us to get back to the top.

You mean "whatever" it takes.

249
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,206
Yeah, I'll do that, too.

250
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,700
That's great news. Yes.

251
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,460
No, I can start Monday.
I would be stoked to start on...

252
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,700
Sorry, I don't say "stoked."
I don't say stuff like that.

I'm, like, I'm pretty cool.
You're gonna like me.

254
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,660
That was bad, too.

We need to attack this problem head-on.

I want 100% commitment
and laser focus, right?

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,721
Great! I will see you Monday.

Hi. Benjamin Applebaum
at your service. Hello.

271
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,770
I just have to say,
you are so spirited. I...

272
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,127
I just wanna put you in a box
and saw you in half.

273
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,681
JESSE: For magic.

274
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,441
As a part of a trick. He does magic.

I'll be honest, I completely
blacked out. How'd I do, man?

00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,580
Honestly? I've seen you do worse.

- Yeah! Nice!
- Yes!

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,361
Oh.

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,220
Where is that?

290
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,970
I don't know. I failed Maps.

291
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,100
It looks like the competition
has been dominated

292
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,220
by that stupid German group
that took over our tour.

293
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,460
- You mean "stole" our tour.
- AMY: Word.

294
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,340
We need to scout those Deutsche-bags.

295
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,441
FLO: Yes.

296
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,220
But how good can they be?

297
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,971
Germany hasn't produced
a good singer since David Hasselhoff.

298
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,565
We're gonna crush them.

299
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,780
And when we do,

300
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,300
we can stick it to these chumps
who send us all this hate mail, like,

301
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,448
"Sonia Sotomayor."

302
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,370
Judgy bitch.

303
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,606
The Bellas are back!

304
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,446
- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah! We're back.

305
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,660
Has anyone talked to Beca today?

306
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,740
JESSE: So?

307
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,887
Any first-day jitters?

308
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,660
No, no. You know, I'm just gonna

309
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,460
be moody and distant. Artists love that.

310
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,561
I know I love that.

311
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,300
Here you go.

312
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,526
Okay.

313
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,420
Dude, why do I feel so guilty?

314
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,980
I've given a lot to the Bellas, right?

315
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,420
It's, like, three years of my life.

316
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,820
Yeah, Bec, you should not feel guilty
at all about taking your shot.

317
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,980
This is a big deal, right?

318
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,208
- Yes, it's a very big deal.
- Okay.

319
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,724
- Go.
- All right.

320
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,364
Nothing's gonna stop my girl!

323
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,725

- Are you ready, or...
- (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

326
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,604
Okay, everybody, huddle up.

327
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,500
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Get up!

328
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,660
Come on! To the table, please!
To the table!

329
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,500
Last one at this table has to help Frank
watch YouTube videos

330
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,100
to find the next Justin Bieber.

331
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,820
Hey, so, I'm turning 25 next week,

332
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,922
if anybody wants to
get some drinks, celebrate.

333
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,122
Frank, buddy, less talk.

334
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,820
Thank you so much.

335
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,002
Okay, my people, check it out.

336
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,491
That...

337
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,769
This... Dax, the tech guy.
Did you call the tech guy?

338
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,180
Yeah, I talked to him.

339
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,443
Do you understand that
everything else in my life works?

340
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,860
Uh-huh.

341
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,644
So, I just need everything here
to work, too, okay?

342
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,848
- Well, he said he was gonna call me back.
- Oh, my God.

343
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,801
You want me to call him now?

344
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,883
(WHISPERING) Don't do it now.

345
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,241
Okay.

346
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,801
There we go.

347
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,887
That is the Lion himself.

348
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,380
That is the legendary Snoop D-O-Double-G

349
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,100
singing White Christmas
at a tree-lighting ceremony in Moscow.

350
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,260
And he was so moved
by the power of music

351
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,020
to unite the world or some shit,

352
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,521
that now he wants to drop
his own cool Christmas album.

353
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,808
And because I sleep on a bed of Grammys,

354
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,340
he has decided to hire me
to produce it. Now...

355
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,420
But Snoop Dogg already dropped
a Christmas album.

356
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,540
If you had listened to
the album like I did,

357
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,770
stranded in the air with T.I.
on a golden hang glider,

358
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,202
then you would have known that none
of the songs were the classics.

359
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,170
I've had to listen to that album
on two separate occasions.

360
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,860
Hang glider with T. I.

361
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,486
And also a rocket ship
that Eminem has built.

362
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,443
It doesn't go anywhere,

363
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,460
but he's got dreams for it, okay?

364
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,166
So I need you to close your mouth.

365
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,163
Herein lies the problem, everybody.

366
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,300
Last time I checked, there are
over a million Christmas albums

367
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,926
with the same 10 damn songs on them.

368
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,764
So, guys, I'm telling you, man,

369
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,002
I need all hands on deck right now

370
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,180
to come up with ideas on how
to make this one stand out.

371
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,725
Okay? You got it?

372
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,890
Fire when ready. I want to hear ideas.

373
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,680
Anything.

374
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,500
Anybody.

375
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,620
Anybody right now would be great.

376
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,260
- Anybody to talk...
- What if we got those dogs...

377
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,850
Anybody but you.

378
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,900
What if we got those dogs
that bark Jingle Bells to back him up?

379
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,620
And let me, let me,
let me guess, let me guess.

380
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,900
You want those dogs to back him up
because he's "Snoop Dogg"?

381
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,940
Yeah!

382
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,940
That is a really great example

383
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,804
of a horrible idea.

384
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,641
Take a lap.

385
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,500
- What?
- Take a lap.

386
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,980
But I'm wearing skinny jeans.

387
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,060
I don't care.

388
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,420
Go. Go.

389
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,726
Let's go. I wanna see knees up.

390
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,891
Knees up, please.

391
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,860
Guys, I should give you
a little more time.

392
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,860
A minute. You got
one minute. 60 seconds.

393
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,500
My time is like a toddler
in a tiara, okay? Precious and short.

394
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,490
I need really great ideas.

You guys weren't there.

to sing for you.

No, can't help you. We're not allowed
to take anyone else new.

What'd you say about your junk?

403
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,645
I'm Emily Junk.

404
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,660
I know, it's weird.
It's my mom's last name.

405
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,524
My dad's last name is Hardon, so...

406
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,361
Um...

407
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,766
I'm a Legacy.

Your mother is Katherine Junk?

411

Who?

412
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,140
Only the top bitch of the 1981 Bellas.

413
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,447
She pioneered
the syncopated booty shake.

414
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,961
And word is she has
a five-octave vocal range.

EMILY: Yep, still does.

416

You do not want to hear that woman
doing it with my dad. Whew.

417
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,140
What an odd thing to say.

418
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,207
True.

419
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,641
If a Legacy wants to audition,
we have to let her.

420

Yeah.

Okay, um, I'd like to perform an
original song that I've been working on.

425

I'm not quite finished with it though,

426
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,845
so let's not be dicks about it.

No. That one, I'm not... I'm still
kind of tinkering with that verse.

really completely set.

- She's definitely not a soloist.
- No.

450
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,700
Technically, she came to us,
so really we're not breaking any rules.

451
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,260
Yeah, it's the perfect loophole.

452

You know, it's always good
to have an extra body.

is thrown into a shipping container,

only leaves and gas receipts.

that she never really opened
her eyes the whole time?

So, have you abandoned your
foolish plans to face us at the Worlds?

I'll mail you.

Large envelope costs nothing.

PIETER: Well, it will cost
more than nothing.

805
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,380
But still cheaper than shipping, like,
a horse, or perhaps an adult moose.

In light of this embarrassing

You shouldn't have done that, Emily.

No!

Because with the wink,
and that's what...

to check out those demos?

you proved that in the booth,

1021
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,340
and I was super excited
to hear what else you had

1022
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,649
and what you gave me was more mash-ups.

1023

That's sort of what I do.

1024

Listen, Reggie. Is it "Reggie"?

1025

"Beca."

1026

Um, that happens a lot, though.
You'd be surprised.

1027
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,380
Okay.

1028
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,860
Here's the thing.

1029
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,740
Um, any kid with ears
and a laptop can do that.

1030
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,365
Dax can do that.

- All right?
- Right.

1032

But if you want to write "music producer"
on your tax forms someday,

1035
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,100
then you've gotta have an original voice.
Do you understand?

1036
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,300
You've gotta show me what you have.

1037
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,060
Right now, what I have
is a demo with mash-ups on it.

1038
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,241
Yeah, yeah.

1039
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,660
I got lots of stuff to say.
I'm just saving it all up.

Uh...

1042
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,060
- What is it? "Beca"?
- Beca.

1043
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,161
Okay, yeah.

1044
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,660
So, you're an intern,

1045
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,660
and everybody else in here is an intern.

1046
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,923
You're talented, everybody else
in here is talented.

1047
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,340
So what the hell makes you special?
Do you know what I mean?

1048
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,900
That's good.

1049
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,780
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
give you one more shot

1050
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,060
to show me who you are
as an artist. Okay?

1051
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,571
Do not waste it.

1052
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,882
No, sir, will not waste it.

I really hope you don't, for your sake.

1054
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,380
'Cause I would hate to think

1055
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,801
that singing covers in an
a cappella group is all you can do.

to hear this message,

Um...

1063

That's music industry speak

Hey.

1068
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,567
What?

There's nothing suspicious about that.

00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,531
Why are you up so late anyways?

1072
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,681
Um, I was just figuring some stuff out.

1073

You're working on the set?

1074

Um...

1075
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,460
I'm not working on the set.
I'm just, like...

1076
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,607
What?

1077
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,208
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

with a key,

- Um...
- Come on, Beca.

You know how we do
that thing every month

and you pretend not to notice?

Don't be mad.

(STAMMERING) I'm not mad, actually.

About the badge.

Beca,

1099
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,010
why didn't you tell us?

1100
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,525
Or at least Chloe.

1101
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,650
I don't know. Just...
'Cause it's just easier.

1102
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,460
There's, like, so much going on,
and Chloe would lose her mind

1103
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,848
if she thought my sole focus
wasn't winning Worlds.

1104
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,883
Sorry, it's just now I'm freaking out,

1105
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,220
because it turns out, like, I'm totally

1106
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,180
not good enough to be a music producer.

1107
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,602
Which is cool and fun to know
as I enter the rest of my life.

1108
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,451
Okay, I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

1109
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,900
You're the most
talented person that I know,

1110
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,002
and I've met three of The Wiggles.

01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,900
Even these common people can see

1270
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,660
that the Barden Bellas
have no shot at reinstatement.

1271
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,410
They are an embarrassment

1272
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,660
to a cappella
and all that it stands for.

1273
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,321
This is what happens
when you send girls to college.

1274
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,081
Is it?

1275
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,084
Is that for a class?

1276
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,300
No, it's just when I get stressed,
words sort of flow right out of me

1277
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,845
and I try and channel them
in my songwriting...

1278
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,860
Are we just gonna ignore
what happened back there?

1279
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,940
Guys, hello?

1280
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,724
The Worlds are right around the corner

1281
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,420
and you guys are acting like we
didn't just eat a big bag of... Ahhh!

1282
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,601
Why are you yelling at me?

1283
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,020
I almost burned to death
because of you a-ca-bitches.

1284
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,860
If you almost died, it was only because
you were standing in the wrong spot.

1285
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,620
No! Flo flipped into me!

1286
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,768
Sure. Blame the minority.

1287
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,651
I'm black, gay, and a woman.

1288
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,802
I'm not pointing the finger at anybody.

1289
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,200
It was Legacy's fault.

1290
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,460
Me? Wait, I didn't...

1291
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,006
Obviously, we're not gonna
beat Das Sound Machine at their game.

1292
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,561
So we need a new plan. Like, now.

1293
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,601
At times like these,
there's only one thing for us to do.

1294
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,684
- Fake your own death and flee the country.
- CHLOE: Close.

1295
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,730
We're going on a retreat.

1296
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,806
KATHERINE: Look, I think the retreat
will be a good thing.

1297
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,645
You girls need to bond
heading into Worlds.

1298
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,820
It'll be so much fun.

1299
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,100
I don't know. No, Mom, it's bad. It's...

1300
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,646
- The girls are yelling at each other.
- Oh, big deal.

1301
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,580
I remember putting your godmother,

1302
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,409
Maggie Pistol, in a choke hold,

1303
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,727
because she insisted
that George Michael was gay.

1304
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,850
- Who?
- Oh.

1305
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,460
I'm just worried that
my entire Bella career

1306
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,767
will be that one terrible performance.

1307
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,009
And I'll never get to solo
at Lincoln Center, you know?

1308
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,850
But you're gonna get to go to Europe.

1309
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,930
That would have been
the highlight of my college career.

1310
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,610
And you girls can win it.

1311
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,125
You have to win it.

1312
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,011
You just made being a Bella
sound so amazing.

1313
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,770
And it is amazing.

1314
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,561
It's a sisterhood that is gonna
support you for the rest of your life.

1315
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,604
I know you're not feeling it,

1316
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,006
but you will.

1317
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,726
This won't be the end of the Bellas.

1318
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,211
Hey, Benji.

1319
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,481
Emily!

1320
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,601
- Listen, I think you're missing a word here.
- What's that?

1321
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,300
Oh, God. No. That's not...
That isn't what I meant. I just...

1322
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,380
EMILY: I didn't think so.

1323
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,820
- That's really embarrassing.
- No, it looks...

1324
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,940
Syntax is usually my forte,

1325
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,660
- so I don't know how that happened.
- Well, it looks great.

1326
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,330
Thank you. That's really sweet...

1327
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,681
Um...

1328
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,681
When my hands
aren't covered in glitter paint,

1329
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,087
do you think maybe
we could try that again?

1330
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,924
Yeah. Sure.

1331
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,651
All right. Okay. Well...

1332
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,369
(STAMMERING) I'll look forward to that.

1333
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,561
Just, you know,

1334
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,580
- let me know when they're clean.
- That's...

1335
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,740
- I will.
- All right.

1336
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,900
- You bet.
- Okay.

1337
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,684
All right. Have a good one.

1338
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,009
CHLOE: Okay, girls!
Everyone, in the bus.

1339
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,060
Go, go, go!

1340
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,220
- CHLOE: Let's go.
- FLO: Okay.

1341
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,420
CHLOE: Seatbelts!

(HONKING HORN)

1343
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,244
EMILY: Good luck, Benji!

1344
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,487
This place is sweet!

1345
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,401
It's nice, right?

1346
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,329
I need to find somewhere
to charge my laptop.

1347
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,321
How'd you hear about this place?

1348
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,010
From yours truly.

1349
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,687
Hello, Bellas.

01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,367
- AMY: Aubrey!
- FLO: Aubrey!

1352
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,780
Okay, girls.

1353
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,211
Oh, wow. Hi! You must be Emily.

1354
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,540
- EMILY: Hey, hey.
- Hey. Hi.

1355
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,380
Welcome to The Lodge at Fallen Leaves,

1356
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,180
where Fortune 500 companies send

1357
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,964
their employees to
build teamwork skills.

1358
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,804
You run this whole place?

1359
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:17,420
You know, I realized I had a knack for
barking orders and bending people's will.

1360
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,602
So I made a career out of it.

1361
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,921
(ALL LAUGHING)

1362
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,220
Which reminds me,

1363
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,980
fall in line, Bellas!

1364
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,100
CYNTHIA: She ain't changed.

1365
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,140
No slouching! No straggling!

1366
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,083
I see you, Jessica.

1367
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:33,485
It is with great sorrow and regret

1368
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,691
that I had to watch
our once proud organization

1369
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,923
become a national disgrace!

1370
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,460
Can I have the keys to the minibar?

1371
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,005
Zip it.

1372
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,367
The Worlds signifies
a shot at redemption.

1373
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,441
You don't have a chance at winning
until you find your sound again.

1374
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,251
You have totally lost your harmony!

1375
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,051
So, for the next two days,

1376
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,886
you will be doing everything together
until you regain it.

1377
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,164
Ladies, get ready to be transformed.

1378
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,088
You are surrounded with the strength
of your fellow Bellas

1379
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,201
and the support of
a proud female tradition.

1380
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,220
And a few dozen bear traps.

1381
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,651
So don't stray too far
from the marked paths.

1382
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,860
- Okay, great, let's go!
- EMILY: All right.

1383
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,460
Well, maybe I'll just
start with a hot shower,

1384
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,766
maybe a little foot rub.

1385
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,764
Fat Amy, there are no
guest rooms for you.

1386
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,928
Then where are we staying?

1387
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,650
I don't understand camping.

1388
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,121
We're voluntarily living like dogs.

1389
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,406
BECA: This is the worst.

1390
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,325
The air we're breathing right now
is at least 90% fart.

1391
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,340
That reminds me,

1392
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,283
I need to see a man about a horse.

1393
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,921
Oh!

1394
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,805
Did anyone happen to pack
a spare roll of toilet paper?

1395
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,685
- Or a moist towelette?
- CHLOE: Nope.

1396
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,289
Anyone have a T-shirt, size extra-small?

1397
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,366
Okay. Side of the tent it is.

1398
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,020
(WHISPERING) What are we doing here?

1399
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,220
We're bonding.

1400
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,260
You seem so tense.
Do you need a back rub?

1401
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,580
Several body parts are rubbing
my back right now, thank you.

1402
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,100
You know, Beca, we're very close,

1403
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,860
but I feel like this retreat
is really gonna let us

1404
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,580
discover everything about each other.

1405
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,681
Is that right?

1406
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,500
You know, one of my biggest regrets

1407
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,331
is that I didn't do enough
experimenting in college.

1408
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,020
You're so weird.

1409
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,201
Thanks.

1410
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,846

I'm moving to Maine to get hitched.

Okay, okay, guys.
Stop asking. I'll tell you.

1585
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:46,288
So, after I graduate there's a chance
I will be deported.

1586
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,340
I will try to re-enter this country,

1587
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,363
but I will probably die at sea.

1588
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,449

You know, when I look back on this,

1594
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,540
I won't remember
performing and competing.

1595
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,290
I'm gonna remember you weirdos.

1596
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,140
It makes me really sad to think

1597
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,083
it won't ever be like this again.

1598

I'm gonna miss you guys.

were gonna do after graduation.

Actually, though,

1613
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,923
if we were to stop and really think,

"What could Fat Amy
be capable of in the future?"

I'll tell you guys.

1616

I'd be living somewhere, like,
sick, like Tulsa or Little Rock.

What were they called?

1777

"The Ladyboys."

1778
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,524
That wasn't the name
of the group, I don't think.

1779
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,045
I think that's how
they described themselves.

1780
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,820
That's right. They're "Manila Envy."

1781
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,900
Manila Envy.

1782
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,460
You know, I spent some time with

1783
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,460
some ladyboys, uh,
in the Philippines myself.

1784
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,561

I'll do a few for you here.

- Okay.

You know, maybe when
the Koreans are out there,

1790
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,767
because no one cares
about the Korean group.
