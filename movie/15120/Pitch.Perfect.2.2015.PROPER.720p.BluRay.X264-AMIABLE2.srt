1
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,774
怎么搞的  Dax  修电脑的  你找修电脑的了吗
This... Dax, the tech guy. Did you call the tech guy?

2
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,192
我跟他说过了
Yeah, I talked to him.

3
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,445
你清楚我生命中的其他东西都能用吧
Do you understand that everything else in my life works?

4
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,863
知道
Uh-huh.

5
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,657
所以这里的一切都要运行正常  懂吗
So, I just need everything here to work, too, okay?

6
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,826
-他说他会回我电话  -老天
- Well, he said he was gonna call me back. - Oh, my God.

7
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,906
你要我现在打给他吗
You want me to call him now?

8
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,871
别现在打
Don't do it now.

9
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,248
好的
Okay.

10
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,791
好了
There we go.

11
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,877
这是雄狮本尊
That is the Lion himself.

12
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,381
这是音乐传奇Snoop D-O-Double-G
That is the legendary Snoop D-O-Double-G

13
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,134
在莫斯科圣诞树点灯仪式唱"白色圣诞节"
singing White Christmas at a tree-lighting ceremony in Moscow.

14
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,261
他被音乐能够团结世界之类的力量
And he was so moved by the power of music

15
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,054
感动的稀里哗啦
to unite the world or some shit,

16
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,515
所以他想发布自己的圣诞专辑
that now he wants to drop his own cool Christmas album.

17
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,809
因为我满床都是格莱美奖
And because I sleep on a bed of Grammys,

18
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,353
他决定找我来发行这张唱片
he has decided to hire me to produce it. Now...

19
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,439
但Snoop Dogg已经发布过圣诞专辑了
But Snoop Dogg already dropped a Christmas album.

20
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,566
你要是有像我一样听那个专辑
If you had listened to the album like I did,

21
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,778
和T.I一起在天上开黄金滑翔机时听
stranded in the air with T.I. on a golden hang glider,

21
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,778
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}T.I. 美国嘻哈唱片歌手，电影和音乐制作人，演员和作家

22
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,126
你就会知道
then you would have known

23
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:55,198
那张专辑没一首歌称得上是经典
that none of the songs were the classics.

24
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,160
我得在两个不同场合听这张专辑
I've had to listen to that album on two separate occasions.

25
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,870
跟T.I.开滑翔机的时候
Hang glider with T.I.

26
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,497
还有在Eminem自己建的火箭船上
and also a rocket ship that Eminem has built.

27
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,458
动都不带动的
It doesn't go anywhere,

28
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,460
但他有驰骋海洋的梦
but he's got dreams for it, okay?

29
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,171
所以你给我闭嘴
So I need you to close your mouth.

30
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,173
所以问题来了  同志们
Herein lies the problem, everybody.

31
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,301
外头有成千上百张圣诞专辑
Last time I checked, there are over a million Christmas albums

32
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,928
每首歌都千篇一律
with the same 10 damn songs on them.

33
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,764
伙计们  我跟你们说
So, guys, I'm telling you, man,

34
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,016
现在所有人都要想出一个
I need all hands on deck right now

35
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,186
能让这张专辑与众不同的点子
to come up with ideas on how to make this one stand out.

36
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,729
都懂了吗
Okay? You got it?

37
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,898
想好就发言  我想听些点子
Fire when ready. I want to hear ideas.

38
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,691
随便说点什么
Anything.

39
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,526
谁来说
Anybody.

40
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,652
谁现在说点什么那就是极好的
Anybody right now would be great.

41
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,279
-谁来说点什么  -要是我们让这些狗
- Anybody to talk... - What if we got those dogs...

42
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,822
谁都可以除了你
Anybody but you.

43
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,909
要是我们让这些狗在后面给他伴唱铃儿响叮当怎么样
What if we got those dogs that bark Jingle Bells to back him up?

44
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,619
让我猜猜  让我猜猜
And let me, let me, let me guess, let me guess.

45
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,914
你想让狗给他伴唱因为他是Snoop Dogg
You want those dogs to back him up because he's "Snoop Dogg"?

45
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,914
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}Dogg与狗同音

46
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:44,998
是啊
Yeah!

47
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,958
这真是个相当好的
That is a really great example

48
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,794
烂点子的例子
of a horrible idea.

49
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,630
跑圈去
Take a lap.

50
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,508
-什么  -跑圈去
- What? - Take a lap.

51
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,009
但人家穿着紧身牛仔裤
But I'm wearing skinny jeans.

52
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,093
我不在乎
I don't care.

53
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,428
快去  快去
Go. Go.

54
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,721
跑起来  高抬腿
Let's go. I wanna see knees up.

55
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,890
高抬腿
Knees up, please.

56
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,906
我再多给你们点时间
Guys, I should give you a little more time.

57
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,895
一分钟  就一分钟  六十秒
A minute. You got one minute. 60 seconds.

58
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,524
我的时间就跟戴皇冠的小宝宝一样珍贵  又珍贵又短
My time is like a toddler in a tiara, okay? Precious and short.

59
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,485
我需要些相当好的点子  Snoop要来了
I need really great ideas. Snoop is coming!

60
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,668
抱歉  我胸都不在原位了  刚在蹦Q
Oh. Sorry, my boobs are all crazy. I was just jumping.

61
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,046
我从面试过来  你们不在那边
I just came from auditions. You guys weren't there.

62
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,006
我希望能有机会唱给你们听
I was hoping for the chance to sing for you.

63
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,884
没法帮你  不能招新人了
No, can't help you. We're not allowed to take anyone else new.

64
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,261
不不不  等等
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait!

65
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,971
我是Junk家的
I'm a Junk!

66
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,472
你说你货什么【求校】
What'd you say about your junk?

67
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,642
我叫Emily Junk
I'm Emily Junk.

68
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,686
我知道有点怪  但我妈就姓这个
I know, it's weird. It's my mom's last name.

69
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,521
我爸姓Hardon[勃起]
My dad's last name is Hardon, so...

71
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,777
我是继承者【legacy望校对统一】
I'm a Legacy.

72
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,320
Junk  Junk
Junk. Junk.

73
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,114
我妈之前也是名Bella
My mom was a Bella.

74
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,366
你妈妈是Katherine Junk吗
Your mother is Katherine Junk?

75
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,450
谁
Who?

76
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,161
1981年最强Bella
Only the top bitch of the 1981 Bellas.

77
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,455
她是切分节奏电臀舞的创始人
She pioneered the syncopated booty shake.

78
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,958
传说她有五音阶的音域
And word is she has a five-octave vocal range.

79
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,126
没错  宝刀未老
Yep, still does.

80
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,212
你可不想在她跟我爸做活塞运动时听到
You do not want to hear that woman doing it with my dad. Whew.

81
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,172
提这个有点微妙啊
What an odd thing to say.

82
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,257
也是
True.

83
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,634
要是继承者想试唱  就得让她唱
If a Legacy wants to audition, we have to let her.

84
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:20,844
好的
Okay, um...

85
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,890
让我们看看你唱功如何
Show us what you got.

86
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,642
现在马上就唱吗  就现在
Right now? Right here? Right here, right now.

87
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,019
字幕
Yeah.

88
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,056
字幕
Okay, um, I'd like to perform

89
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:33,398
字幕
an original song that I've been working on.

90
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,859
字幕
I'm not quite finished with it though,

91
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,819
字幕
so let's not be dicks about it.

92
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,614
字幕
Sorry, that was crass, wasn't it?

93
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,407
字幕
Fat Amy, you have a lovely vagina.

94
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,367
字幕
Thank you. Proceed.

95
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,999
字幕
When tomorrow comes I'll be on my own

96
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:55,253
字幕
Feeling frightened of the things that I don't know

97
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,341
字幕
When tomorrow comes When tomorrow comes

98
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,511
字幕
When tomorrow comes

99
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,098
字幕
And though the road is long I look up to the sky

100
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,767
字幕
Darkness all around...

101
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:09,675
字幕
No. That one, I'm not...

102
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:11,186
字幕
I'm still kind of tinkering with that verse.

103
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,521
字幕
So it's not... Nothing's really completely set.

104
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,566
字幕
I got all I need when I got you and I

105
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,861
字幕
'Cause I look around me and see a sweet life

106
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,739
字幕
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight

107
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,368
字幕
You're getting me, getting me through the night

108
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:34,793
字幕
You are my flashlight

109
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,631
字幕
Would you excuse us for just one second?

110
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,927
字幕
She's pretty good. Can't we take her?

111
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,721
字幕
What do you expect us to say? She's standing right there.

112
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,642
字幕
She's definitely not a soloist. No.

113
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,980
字幕
Technically, she came to us,

114
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:53,728
字幕
so really we're not breaking any rules.

115
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,271
字幕
Yeah, it's the perfect loophole.

116
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,983
字幕
You know, it's always good to have an extra body.

117
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,527
字幕
Just in case one of us gets kidnapped for ransom,

118
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,153
字幕
is thrown into a shipping container,

119
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,198
字幕
and is made to eat only leaves and gas receipts.

120
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,492
字幕
Mmm, I agree. We need new blood.

121
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,911
字幕
I don't think we should decide anything without Beca.

122
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,288
字幕
I keep a penny under my tongue.

123
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,083
字幕
Did anyone else think it was creepy

124
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,168
字幕
that she never really opened her eyes the whole time?

125
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,087
字幕
Again, we're talking about her

126
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,922
字幕
and she's standing right there. Oh, yeah.

127
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,340
字幕
But if we're gonna talk negatives,

128
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,134
字幕
let's start with the giraffe legs.

129
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,678
字幕
Okay, let's take a vote on it.

130
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,322
字幕
Anyone who wants her in, sing a G-sharp.

131
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,723
字幕
Anyone who doesn't, sing an E-flat.

132
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,599
字幕
Okay. One, two...

133
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,109
字幕
I like your shirt.

134
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,363
字幕
Welcome to the Bellas!

135
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,533
字幕
O-M-a-ca-G! Whoo!

136
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,661
字幕
Oh. Stop, girl, stop. Yeah, stop, stop it.

137
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,288
字幕
- Girl, stop. - Sorry.

138
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,041
字幕
So, when does initiation start?

139
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:56,858
字幕
Tell you what, I'll go

140
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,293
字幕
back to my dorm and pretend to be surprised

141
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,502
字幕
when you throw the hood over my head

142
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,628
字幕
and make me solve a Rubik's Cube

143
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,297
字幕
while sucking vodka from a maxi pad.

144
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,049
字幕
That's what my mom said happened.

145
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,133
字幕
Mmm, no can do.

146
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,426
字幕
Well, look around.

147
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,971
字幕
We don't exactly have a maxi pad to spare, so...

148
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,224
字幕
All right, grab your guts, ladies! It's party time!

149
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,810
字幕
We've got tickets to Copenhagen and a brand new Bella!

150
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,773
字幕
Let's go! All right.

151
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,611
字幕
- Should I... - Come on, girl!

152
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,154
字幕
I'm gonna just leave my bag here.

153
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,490
字幕
Let's go get into treble!

154
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,325
字幕
Has this bush always been here?

155
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,493
字幕
Oh! Watch this.

156
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,777
字幕
You know there's a gate, right?

157
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,291
字幕
Wow.

158
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,335
字幕
My first college party.

159
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,004
字幕
Yeah, well, this isn't just any college party.

160
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,757
字幕
This is a cappella only! Yeah.

161
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,843
字幕
So, get prepared to meet a lot of sexually confused men.

162
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,387
字幕
Bellas! Welcome, welcome, welcome!

163
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,414
字幕
Jesse! Where is Beca?

164
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:54,390
字幕
I thought she was gonna be with you tonight.

165
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,475
字幕
I thought she was with you.

166
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,893
字幕
I thought she was with you.

167
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,731
字幕
Hey! Benji, right?

168
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,446
字幕
Those aren't... Okay, those aren't words.

169
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,909
字幕
I'm sorry?

170
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,203
字幕
...the movies?

171
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,538
字幕
Are you asking me out?

172
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
字幕
Yes. Yeah?

173
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,251
字幕
Oh. That's so sweet.

174
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,811
字幕
It's just, my... It's my first day. Um...

175
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,589
字幕
I wasn't really planning on rushing in on anything.

176
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,064
字幕
Hey! Oh. Hey! You made it!

177
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,900
字幕
Yeah, I couldn't miss our last Hood Night party.

178
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,360
字幕
Oh. So?

179
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,487
字幕
How was the internship?

180
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,990
字幕
Eye-opening. Yeah, they do not mess around.

181
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,908
字幕
Hey, Chloe asked where you were.

182
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,535
字幕
Why didn't you tell her?

183
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,245
字幕
Oh. She's just...

184
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,414
字幕
She's locked into the Worlds right now

185
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,707
字幕
and I'm looking for the right time.

186
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,916
字幕
I'll tell her.

187
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,960
字幕
Bumper's back!

188
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,253
字幕
Whoo!

189
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,046
字幕
Campus security!

190
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,257
字幕
Bumper! Bumper!

191
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,259
字幕
Fat Amy's back!

192
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,887
字幕
'Cause I never left 'cause I'm still here.

193
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,198
字幕
Whoo! But I'm back, so

194
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:17,599
字幕
it's a big deal because I've arrived again!

195
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,477
字幕
You know, for someone who left school years ago,

196
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,146
字幕
you're harder to shake than mono.

197
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,275
字幕
I've got some pretty big news.

198
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,359
字幕
What?

199
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,071
字幕
I have been hand-plucked to be put on a waiting list

200
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:37,035
字幕
to be put on a very well-known TV singing competition.

201
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,119
字幕
Really? Yep.

202
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,284
字幕
I know what you're thinking.

203
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,413
字幕
"Oh, Bumper.

204
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,999
字幕
"You shut your face and kiss me, Bumper."

205
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,209
字幕
No.

206
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,419
字幕
"Bumper, please, just shut your trap."

207
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,795
字幕
That is not how I talk.

208
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,006
字幕
You talk exactly like this. Do not.

209
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,132
字幕
Yes, you do.

210
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,134
字幕
I don't.

211
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,345
字幕
So shut up. You shut up.

212
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,899
字幕
Hi!

213
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,983
字幕
Hi.

214
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,152
字幕
I am so excited to meet the woman

215
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,613
字幕
who single-handedly created the Bella sound.

216
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,822
字幕
We're sisters!

217
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,366
字幕
I can't believe we're sisters!

218
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:17,951
字幕
Oh! Yeah, hi! Hi!

219
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,494
字幕
Chloe texted me we added a Legacy.

220
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,995
字幕
I didn't even know that was a thing.

221
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,067
字幕
Shh.

222
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,790
字幕
Remind me again why we are at a car show.

223
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,459
字幕
We're here for one reason and one reason only.

224
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,752
字幕
To scout the competition.

225
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,212
字幕
It's totally gonna help us win the Worlds

226
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,588
字幕
if we know what we're up against.

227
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,382
字幕
All right.

228
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,676
字幕
Now, where are those tour thieves?

229
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
字幕
Stacie!

230
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,804
字幕
Keep it in your pants, maybe.

231
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,389
字幕
Stacie! What?

232
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,559
字幕
What the...

233
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,312
字幕
This all should have been ours!

234
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,564
字幕
I hate these Germans.

235
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,984
字幕
Holy a-ca-mole!

236
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,321
字幕
Okay, the cars moved. Nothing else happened yet.

237
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,949
字幕
But they're moving backwards. With ghosts driving them.

238
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:46,414
字幕
We are Das Sound Machine.

239
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,166
字幕
A German collective,

240
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,919
字幕
operating in concert to create sonic mastery.

241
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,840
字幕
What better way to appreciate automotive perfection?

242
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,157
字幕
Man, they massive!

243
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,159
字幕
How are we gonna compete with a group that size?

244
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,619
字幕
They're so freakin' in sync.

245
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,534
字幕
Do we clap?

246
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,618
字幕
Do we clap? Do we clap?

247
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,703
字幕
Politely clap.

248
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,381
字幕
Barden Bellas. You came here to see us?

249
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:04,719
字幕
Is it because you are... What do the American kids say, "Jelly"?

250
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,221
字幕
We are so not "Jelly."

251
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,725
字幕
We should really thank you for making this tour a reality,

252
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,102
字幕
you know, with your bumbling ineptitude.

253
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,563
字幕
We should send them something. Fruit basket?

254
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,856
字幕
Yum, yum.

255
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,400
字幕
Or would you prefer mini-muffins?

256
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,819
字幕
Okay, we didn't come here to start something with you guys.

257
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,696
字幕
We just wanted to check you out before the Worlds,

258
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,156
字幕
where we're gonna kick your ass.

259
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,116
字幕
What? That's right.

260
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,076
字幕
You?

261
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,329
字幕
You are the kicker of ass?

262
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,331
字幕
Yeah.

263
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,333
字幕
You are so tiny.

264
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,626
字幕
Like an elf.

265
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,295
字幕
Or is it a fairy? Sprite?

266
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,964
字幕
"Troll."

267
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,133
字幕
That's it. You are like a troll.

268
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,801
字幕
You

269
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,638
字幕
are physically flawless.

270
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,722
字幕
Thank you.

271
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,974
字幕
But it doesn't mean I like you.

272
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,686
字幕
We are not scared about the Worlds,

273
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,439
字幕
because when the Bellas hit the stage, we are gonna blow minds.

274
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,524
字幕
With what?

275
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,318
字幕
More of Flabby Abby's baby chute?

276
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,569
字幕
That's not my name.

277
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:04,779
字幕
I don't know your name.

278
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,863
字幕
Could be anything.

279
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:09,700
字幕
Obese Denise, Inflexible Tina, Lazy Susan.

280
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,206
字幕
Mein name ist Fat Amy, und I eat krauts like you for lunch.

281
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,377
字幕
Your team is like a... How do you say that? A heated mess.

282
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,547
字幕
You know, a mess where heat is applied to it,

283
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,384
字幕
so what once was a little messy is now even messier.

284
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,136
字幕
Darlings, please take my advice.

285
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,055
字幕
Don't try to beat us.

286
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,390
字幕
You can't.

287
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,766
字幕
We're the best.

288
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,310
字幕
And now I really must go rest my neck.

289
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,938
字幕
It is sore from looking down on you.

290
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,022
字幕
Okay,

291
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,067
字幕
just because you're making me very sexually confused,

292
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,152
字幕
does not mean that you are intimidating.

293
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,988
字幕
We have nothing to lose.

294
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,073
字幕
We have literally nothing! Okay.

295
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,075
字幕
A-ca wiedersehen, bitches!

296
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,744
字幕
Oh, what is happening? I am using my hands so much.

297
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,746
字幕
All right, ladies, focus up.

298
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,748
字幕
We need to beat those German dummkopfs.

299
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,250
字幕
- Yes! - Yeah.

300
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,377
字幕
Okay, we're gonna beat DSM at their own game.

301
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,045
字幕
Do what they do, just better.

302
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,047
字幕
And we're about to do a full skills assessment

303
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,091
字幕
to blow out our choreography to match.

304
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,595
字幕
But the important thing is that we have fun, right?

305
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,598
字幕
Uh, Legacy, don't take this the wrong way,

306
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,474
字幕
but you're the dumbest person alive.

307
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,613
字幕
And you're a cat!

308
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,115
字幕
And one...

309
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,284
字幕
Okay, Lilly, that's really scaring me.

310
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,707
字幕
That just looks weird.

311
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,542
字幕
People are not birds.

312
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,006
字幕
Cartwheel. And roll! Amy, that wasn't a roll.

313
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,057
字幕
Again.

314
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,531
字幕
Is it weird that we never got around to singing today?

315
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,242
字幕
Uh, well, it's kind of hard to start singing

316
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,161
字幕
without arrangements, and that's on me.

317
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,621
字幕
So thank you for reminding me.

318
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,289
字幕
Yeah, Bec, we're gonna need that ASAP

319
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,916
字幕
so we can start nailing down our choreography.

320
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,668
字幕
Right on top of that, Chlo. Awes!
