- Who are you guys?

459
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,479
We are not guys.
We are hot chicks.

460
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,232
She's totally right.

461
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:46,320
The Continuum Transfunctioner is
a very mysterious and powerful device.

462
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,365
- And?
- And its mystery is only exceeded by its power.

463
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,827
Well, that doesn't really help.

464
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:17,059
We will give you pleasure now ifyou
give us the Continuum Transfunctioner.

465
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,062
Let me get
your proposition straight.

466
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,439
First, you give us
the... pleasure...

467
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,858
then we give you
the Continuum Transfunctioner?

468
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,028
No. First, you give us
the Continuum Transfunctioner...

469
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,280
then we give you
the pleasure.

470
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,950
- [ Sighs ]
- I've heard that one before.

471
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,077
Look. How about this?

472
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:38,455
You give me pleasure...

473
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,791
then we'll give you
the Continuum Transfunctioner.

474
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,627
- Then, ifthere's time, you could take care of my friend.
- Deal.

475
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,546
- Sweet! Oh, thank you.
- Will you wait a second, please?

476
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,967
Come here. Dude, those space nerds
told us not to trust anybody.

477
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:54,680
Yeah. But, for the love of God,
they're offering us oral pleasure.

478
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,932
Wh—

479
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,934
Okay.

480
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,436
Hey, where did
the hot chicks go?

481
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,232
Where's my money, boys?

482
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,778
Uh, we were just going to get it.

483
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:13,407
You guys picked the wrong
transsexual stripper to screw with.

484
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,450
- You're pinching me.
- Ha!

485
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,037
Let's see what the cops
have to say about this, huh?

486
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,206
- [ Both Laughing ]
- You're busted.

487
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,917
Busted! B-U-S-T.

00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,461

00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,006
What the- Chester!

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,466
I saw this on Cops!
Hit hard and hit back!

491
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,012
- Bye-bye, boys.
- [ Chester ] Can you put on the siren?

492
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:39,516
So, you're sticking
to the "I don't remember" crap?

493
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,518
Yeah. We don't remember.

494
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,604
Last night, your car was spotted
leaving the scene of a major drug deal.

495
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,274
Wait. You found my car?

496
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,902
Believe me, you guys got more important
things to worry about right now.

497
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,531
Where were you between the hours
of midnight and 2:00 a. m. last night?

498
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:58,660
I told you. Okay, we—
we don't remember anything.

499
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:03,206
I see we're gonna have
to do this the hard way.

500
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:07,669
Where were you last night between
the hours of midnight and 2:00 a. m.?

501
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,880
We- We don't know.

502
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,016
What the—

503
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,356
- Now do you remember?
- [ Both ] No.

[ Coffee Sizzling ]

505
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,494
- How about now?
- No.

Hey! Leave him alone!
He doesn't know anything!

507
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,219
- Now are you ready to talk?
- Dude, we don't remember.

508
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:01,056
Okay. Here are the whips
you guys wanted.

509
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,767
- [ Whip Cracks ]
- Hey.

510
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,645
- It's the doughnut guys.
- Huh?

511
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,106
These two were at the Frenchy Donut House
last night when me and Louie came in.

512
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,817
We started talkin', and they ended up
buying doughnuts for the whole precinct.

513
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,861
Oh. What time
did all this happen?

514
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,323
Uh, let's see. Must've been
between midnight and 2:00 a. m.

515
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:24,204
Damn! You can't be the guys
we're looking for. Sorry.

516
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,920
Hang in there, bro.

517
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:35,590
Come on, Kojak. Moron.

518
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,301
Listen, I'm really sorry
about all this.

519
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,054
Looks like it was a case
of mistaken identity.

520
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,559
Actually, those are
the real criminals over there.

521
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,145
One of our officers
made the wrong identification.

00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:52,566
Yeah. Uh, that— I'm— That was me.
I'm sorry about that one, fellas.

exactly where your car is.

Now we get the anniversary gifts, go to the

Ah, la-la, mm. Okay.

Did you guys say you wanted your car
back or you wanted it impounded?

- Uh... we want the car back, please.
- Oh, I see.

535
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,444
That's kind of funny
because what happened was...

00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:41,573
I accidentally sent y-your car,
uh, to the impound.

- [ Together ] Rick.
- I know. Uh, I can definitely tell you this:

that you guys can get the car back
in a couple of days.

539
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,041
We don't have a couple of days.
We need the car back now.

- Yeah. Say, uh...

That's a good one there.

Hey, fellas,

You're such a jokester.

but I bet you those punks over there do.

What are you doing hanging out
with those jerks, anyway?

00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,927
They were just being nice to me,
unlike someone I know.

557
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,763
Maybe it's time I find someone
who has a more sensitive side to him...

someone who respects me
as a person.

- We are hot chicks.

We believe Jesse and Chester
have the Continuum Transfunctioner.

565
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:16,876
However, ifyou recover the Continuum
Transfunctioner from them and bring it to us...

we will give you

get the Continuum Transfunctioner...
