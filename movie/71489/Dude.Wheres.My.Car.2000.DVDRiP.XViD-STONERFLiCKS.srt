{575}{687}The following story is based on actual events...
{862}{971}DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?
{4004}{4046}What's Up?
{4052}{4094}Animal Planet
{4100}{4166}Man, I just had the craziest dream.
{4172}{4190}About what?
{4196}{4275}I don't remember.
{4316}{4334}Morning guys.
{4340}{4415}Morning Gene.
{4484}{4525}What did we do last night?
{4531}{4573}I don't know.
{4579}{4645}Wait, didn't the twins have a party?
{4651}{4693}Yeah! That's it. Twins had a party!
{4699}{4767}Right!
{4771}{4813}Were we there?
{4819}{4951}I'm assuming we were. What kind of|boyfriends would we be if we weren't.
{4963}{5005}Any messages?
{5011}{5076}No.
{5107}{5125}See you tomorrow Gene.
{5131}{5199}Shibby.
{5251}{5293}How do you know Gene?
{5299}{5365}Oh, I thought he was your friend.
{5371}{5457}No, no, I don't know him.
{5514}{5589}I'm starving.
{5682}{5748}It's... pudding.
{5754}{5844}I always wondered what a fridge|full of pudding would look like.
{5850}{5916}Is it possible that we got|so wasted last night,
{5922}{6058}that we bought a lifetime supply of|pudding and then totally forgot about it?
{6089}{6182}I'd say it's entirely possible.
{6185}{6323}Jesse and Chester are shibby at the moment.|Please leave your shibby at the beep. Shibby.
{6329}{6371}- What happened to you guys last night?
{6377}{6429}- You showed with the bunch of people, pizzas and a cake...
{6435}{6463}...and now our house is trashed.
{6469}{6538}- You guys are sucky boyfriends.|You're always disappointing us.
{6544}{6610}- And now you're probably just sitting|there on the couch in your underwear...
{6616}{6658}...playing stupid thumbwars...
{6664}{6706}...wearing your ridiculous army helmets...
{6712}{6778}...and if you are you've|probably forgotten our anniversary...
{6784}{6826}...which is TODAY!
{6832}{6898}That means you don't get the special|treats we had in store for you.
{6904}{6963}We just wanted to call and thank|you guys for trashing our house.
{6969}{7018}BYE!
{7024}{7066}Twins are pissed dude.
{7072}{7138}Good thing we already bought them gifts.
{7144}{7232}So..., where are the gifts?
{7240}{7330}- They must be in your car.|- Right! They're in the car. OK.
{7336}{7426}So we'll just go and take the gifts|over to twins house and get our special treats.
{7432}{7497}Hey! What do you think they mean by special treats?
{7503}{7565}We've been going out with the twins for year now.
{7571}{7623}And we still haven't had sex.
{7629}{7737}Special treats is code for sex.
{7743}{7761}Of course!
{7767}{7794}Special treats!
{7800}{7818}Sex!
{7824}{7857}Open up you two shackals!
{7863}{7909}It's Mr. Pizzacoli
{7915}{8049}You guys left work last night with 30 pizzas that|didn't get delivered and I want some answers!
{8055}{8097}Open up this damn door!
{8103}{8175}It's open!
{8223}{8291}Moron!
{8487}{8553}Hey. Mr. Pizzacoli! Hey, how are you doing?
{8559}{8600}Thirty pizzas didn't get delivered last night.
{8606}{8696}If I ever found out you were taking my|pizzas home for your own eating pleasure...
{8702}{8754}...I will crush you like a doodlebug!
{8760}{8788}Look! It's an elephant.
{8794}{8865}What?
{8870}{8888}Just a mailman.
{8894}{8999}You two are the most|irresponsible, not to mention...
{9005}{9033}...disappointing employees ever to work...
{9039}{9104}...at Mr. Pizzacoli Pronto Pizza Deliveries.
{9110}{9176}Well, a trained dolphin|could do a better job than you.
{9182}{9248}Well, sure but then the pizzas would get all wet.
{9254}{9332}Look! A unicorn!
{9350}{9392}A unicorn?
{9398}{9464}Sorry, I guess it was just a regular horse. Weird.
{9470}{9566}I know you've been embezzling|my pizza. And I will get you eventually.
{9572}{9613}And when I do I swear to God...
{9619}{9735}you will never deliver pizzas in this town again.
{9805}{9823}Close one.
{9829}{9896}Yeah.
{9925}{9991}So, we'll go to the twins house,|we'll give them their anniversary gifts...
{9997}{10063}...and then we'll apologise for|trashing their house and then....
{10069}{10160}...we get our special treats.

{23159}{23201}Where did we get a suitcase full of money?
{23207}{23225}Man, and why don't we have it now?
{23231}{23338}Maybe we deposited it in a Swiss bank account.
{23351}{23441}No. If we had a ridiculous|sum of money where would we go?
{23447}{23514}Dude.
{23686}{23754}Sweet.

{26180}{26222}Sweet.
{26228}{26366}So. Just how super special|can a slippery lap dance be?
{26372}{26462}What the hell were you thinking throwing around|my money like that?|That wasn't part of the plan!
{26468}{26509}You're a...

{27139}{27181}200 000 $.
{27187}{27229}200 000 $?
{27235}{27325}I gave you the suitcase and left. You guys were|supposed to meet me|but you never showed up.
{27331}{27373}Where's that suitcase?
{27379}{27397}I don't know.
{27403}{27480}You don't know?
{27690}{27732}Where's that suitcase?
{27738}{27756}It's in my car.
{27762}{27780}Then get it! Fast.
{27786}{27881}Or else you'll be singing soprano.
{28146}{28212}Dude, dude!
{28218}{28236}We've got to go.
{28242}{28284}What? Are you crazy? I'm|strawing by breakdancing strippers.

{28721}{28739}Huh. Sounds like us.
{28745}{28763}Man.
{28769}{28787}How wasted were we last night.
{28793}{28835}Well, I touched Christie Bonner's hoohoo...
{28841}{28955}...we're on the hook for a 200 000 $ on loan|from transsexual stripper|and my car is gone.
{28961}{28979}I'd say we were pretty wasted.
{28985}{29051}Dude, we really need to find your car.
{29057}{29147}OK. Let's see, the last place we|remember being last night was...
{29153}{29171}the twins.
{29177}{29243}But we can't show up without the anniversary gifts.
{29249}{29267}I got it.
{29273}{29339}We'll just get them a|little something for now.
{29345}{29411}And then, when we find the car|we'll give them the real gifts.
{29417}{29482}Dollar, thirty nine.
{29488}{29506}I don't know.
{29512}{29554}Trust me.
{29560}{29578}It's gonna be totally cool.
{29584}{29602}OK.
{29608}{29679}Let's go.
{29728}{29794}We are so dead.
{29800}{29873}Roger that.
{30328}{30394}We've been cleaning all morning.|What do you guys have to say for yourselves?
{30400}{30455}Happy anniversary.
{30461}{30489}The
{30495}{30586}The Twins
{30591}{30681}We ate all the dark ones coz we|now you guys don't like those.
{30687}{30753}Dark ones are the only ones we do like.
{30759}{30801}Oh yeah.
{30807}{30859}But, but, you could use the box...
{30865}{30991}...to keep...to keep...
{30997}{31058}...ribbons.
{31095}{31137}You guys forgot our anniversary. Didn't you?
{31143}{31161}Of course not!
{31167}{31223}No! We got you guys great gifts.
{31229}{31257}We just had some car troubles.
{31263}{31329}Yeah. But we came over here as soon|as we could|to help you guys clean up...
{31335}{31401}...but, oh no.
{31407}{31449}It looks like you're already done.

{34163}{34181}Yeah.
{34187}{34286}Dude, we really need to find your car.
{34427}{34445}Hey guys.
{34451}{34516}Sorry about yanking you off the street|like that but we really need to talk to you.
{34522}{34564}Who are you guys?
{34570}{34621}My name is Zarnoff. This is Zabu....
{34627}{34693}...Zellner, Zelbor, Zelmina and Jeff.
{34699}{34756}Hey.
{34762}{34804}To answer your question more specifically:
{34810}{34900}We are the recipients of instructions|from extraterrestrials regarding the
{34906}{35023}interstellar path to outer space.
{35026}{35044}Go ahead and laugh.
{35050}{35096}We are used to be in mot.
{35102}{35164}OK.
{35170}{35236}We've been sent by a wise and powerful leader
{35242}{35260}Zoltan.
{35266}{35356}to find you and recover the continuum transfunctioner.
{35362}{35428}Hey. Have you guys ever been to Uranus?
{35434}{35499}Yeah. It's supposed to be|really nice at this time of the year.
{35505}{35547}Hey. This is important.
{35553}{35643}We intercepted an interstellar|message that leads us to believe...
{35649}{35726}...that last night you were in|possession of the continuum transfunctioner.
{35732}{35763}Where is it now?
{35769}{35787}The who what?
{35793}{35883}The continuum transfunctioner is a|very mysterious and powerful device...
{35889}{35907}and?
{35913}{36003}...and it's mystery is|exceeded only by it's power.
{36009}{36075}I'm sorry but we don't|remember a thing about last night.
{36081}{36123}You must be careful.
{36129}{36195}Danger follows the continuum transfunctioner.
{36201}{36219}So says Zoltan.
{36225}{36293}Zoltan.
{36297}{36339}I'll tell you what. You know...
{36345}{36458}...we'll keep our eyes up for|the continual|transthing and if we see it
{36464}{36482}we'll give you a call.
{36488}{36506}Yes, you must.
{36512}{36552}But remember. You are in great danger.
{36558}{36619}Trust no one.
{36632}{36650}Except for us.
{36656}{36709}Oh yes. Thank you Jeff. Good point.
{36715}{36746}Trust no one except for us.
{36752}{36821}Zoltan.
{36944}{36986}Wait a second. Let's recap.
{36992}{37106}Last night we lost my car. We accepted|stolen money from transsexual stripper.
{37112}{37178}And now some space nerds wants us to|find something we can't pronounce.
{37184}{37315}I hate to say it Chester but maybe|we should cut back on the shibbying.
{37352}{37370}Thanks dude.
{37376}{37442}Oh good! You're right on time.

{41020}{41088}Hello.

{44401}{44443}But who's Johnny Potsmoker?
{44449}{44466}That's my alter ego.
{44472}{44514}Oh big, no, I thought that was my alter ego.

{44760}{44861}OK dude. There it is. Break time's over.
{44870}{44898}Time to find my car.

{45048}{45066}Huh?
{45072}{45159}Are you Jesse and Chester?
{45192}{45210}I don't know. Why?

{45743}{45809}...and it's mystery is only exceeded by it's power.
{45815}{45901}That doesn't really help.
{46343}{46433}We will give you pleasure now if|you give us the continuum transfunctioner.
{46439}{46504}Let me get your proposition straight.
{46510}{46624}First, you give us the pleasure,|then we give you the continuum transfunctioner?
{46630}{46768}No. First, you give us the continuum transfunctioner,|then we give you the pleasure.

{61997}{62096}- No|- I bet we got them sucky gifts.
{62117}{62187}We suck.
{62333}{62399}Wait a second. I just got a really|bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.
{62405}{62446}Maybe you should go sit on the toilet?
{62452}{62560}No. No. You know what the feeling is?
{62572}{62644}It's love!
{62644}{62686}Is that what that is?

{62908}{62926}We can?
{62932}{62974}Yeah! And you know what else?
{62980}{63070}I'll bet you that we did buy|them super cool anniversary gifts.
{63076}{63094}You know why?
{63100}{63118}Coz we love them.
{63124}{63179}And we wrapped them really cool wrapping paper?
{63185}{63199}Yeah.
{63205}{63238}I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
{63244}{63310}We're gonna go down the impound lot and get the car...
{63316}{63334}...which has the gifts in it...
{63340}{63429}...and then we're gonna go over to the twins house|and beg for them to take us back!
{63435}{63453}Yeah!
{63459}{63477}Let's do it!
{63483}{63549}Oh, no, hold on.

{63939}{63981}Boys, I got some good news for you.
{63987}{64029}We just got your car in this morning.
{64035}{64053}Alright!
{64059}{64169}But the bad news is: Not only did officer|Boyer send your car to the impound...
{64175}{64293}...he tagged it for auction and|it was sold this afternoon.
{64299}{64317}Rick...
{64323}{64365}Do you know who bought the car?
{64371}{64436}I happen to have the address right here.
{64442}{64484}Alright.
{64490}{64644}But it'd be against regulation|457XY2D665 to give it to you.
{64658}{64700}Come on...
{64706}{64772}Reaching on to this side of the counter is not allowed.
{64778}{64899}The last guy who tried it|ended up with three broken fingers.
{64946}{64974}Reach it.
{64980}{65009}You can reach it.
{65015}{65172}No. I got one of these carpal|tunnels. What if I further injure myself.
{65186}{65204}I have to do everything.
{65210}{65322}Well. I'm a better lookout.|My vision's better. You know that.

{66432}{66520}Here she comes. SPIT! SPIT!
{66526}{66666}Good news guys. I talked to my supervisor and|he said I can give you the address after all.
{66672}{66714}That's great.
{66720}{66786}But the bad news is
{66792}{66896}I'm gonna have to confiscate your pinky
{67248}{67342}Alright. Next stop: find my car.
{67348}{67386}Hey. Check it out.

{67607}{67673}Wait. I got an idea.
{67679}{67721}Now we just go over there and ask|for the continuum transfunctioner?
{67727}{67768}Yeah. It's that easy.
{67774}{67841}Thank you both. Very much.
{67847}{67889}Hey. Don't mention it.

{68645}{68748}They're totally harmless.
{69142}{69208}Now, may I have the continuum transfunctioner?
{69214}{69256}Not quite yet.
{69262}{69376}Would you consider giving it to|me while I continue to give you pleasure?
{69382}{69447}OK.

{70406}{70492}We're going over there.
{70498}{70526}A barn? Is it red?
{70532}{70560}No.
{70566}{70645}Then it's not a barn.
{70772}{70790}This is creepy.
{70796}{70862}It's like a country music video.
{70868}{70886}Alright. That's far enough.
{70892}{70910}You there.
{70916}{70934}You over there.

{74574}{74672}The time has come you guys.
{74775}{74913}We are finally going to fulfil our|prophecy of outer space travel.
{74919}{74961}Zoltan!
{74967}{75081}They laughed at us when we said that aliens existed and|they mothed us when we started wearing...
{75087}{75196}...bubble wrap jump suits.|But who's laughing now?
{75231}{75273}I'll tell you who's laughing now. We are!
{75279}{75321}Zoltan.
{75327}{75393}Soon we will leave this lame planet and
{75399}{75552}fly through outer space|with cool aliens who like us.
{75566}{75653}It is going to be awesome!
{75782}{75814}That's them.
{75820}{75872}They knocked us out and stole our spacesuits.
{75878}{75896}No we didn't
{75902}{75920}Yeah you did!
{75926}{75957}No we didn't
{75963}{75982}Yes you did!
{75988}{76016}No we didn't.
{76022}{76040}Yes you did.
{76046}{76167}Hey, who you're gonna believe?|Us or them?
{76214}{76303}So you're Jesse and Chester.
{76310}{76376}I've been looking forward|to meeting you guys, although...
{76382}{76475}I'm sorry it had to be like this.
{76477}{76495}Wanda!
{76501}{76543}Wilma!
{76549}{76706}Normally we would never resort violence but|we are dealing with continuum transfunctioner afterall.
{76707}{76735}If you don't deliver it to us...
{76741}{76807}...your girlfriends are history.
{76813}{76855}Don't worry girls. We'll save you.
{76861}{76949}Yeah. You can depend on us.
{76957}{76999}Enough.
{77005}{77115}Go now and bring us the|continuum transfunctioner.
{77125}{77243}And be quiet on your way out,|my parents are taking a nap.
{77484}{77548}And then you can tell us where|the continuum transfunctioner is.
{77554}{77598}And then?
{77604}{77641}And then we'd be able to go and get it.
{77647}{77723}And then?
{77748}{77832}Can I get an order of shrimp fried rice?
{77838}{77886}Wow, wow, wow.
{77892}{77958}I don't see the car. Are you|sure this is the place?
{77964}{78006}The car'd better be in there.
{78012}{78073}I almost lost my pinky to get that info.
{78084}{78193}Oh man, I sense there's something|very canadian about this place.
{78324}{78393}Plan B!
{78443}{78485}Right.
{78491}{78509}Are you ready?
{78515}{78581}Let's do this.
{78587}{78605}One.
{78611}{78629}Two.
{78635}{78703}Three.
{78803}{78880}I'm ok. You ok?
{78899}{78967}Shibby.
{79762}{79842}Dude. It's a lama.
{79858}{79948}It's not a lama. It's an ostrich.
{79954}{80044}OK. Very slowly...
{80050}{80092}...let's turn around...
{80098}{80116}...and go back the other way.
{80122}{80187}OK.
{80266}{80332}New plan. We turn around again...
{80338}{80404}...very slowly...
{80410}{80451}...and go back the other way.
{80457}{80522}OK.
{80649}{80730}They're everywhere.
{80769}{80811}What now?
{80817}{80888}Hey, I saw this thing about|ostriches on Animal Planet.
{80894}{80931}Those are lama's dude.
{80937}{81051}No. What you're supposed|to do is stand very still...
{81057}{81163}...and eventually they'll|get bored and go away.
{81249}{81332}I think it's working.
{81488}{81563}Stupid lamas.
{81584}{81655}Let's go!
{81728}{81794}Let's get in this car!
{81800}{81870}Chester.
{81896}{81914}What ostriches eat?
{81920}{81962}Why?
{81968}{82010}If they eat peanuts...
{82016}{82082}...we'll just throw them |peanuts and they'll go away.
{82088}{82130}We don't have any peanuts.
{82136}{82219}Great, we're screwed.
{82423}{82441}They're leaving. It worked.
{82447}{82489}What worked?
{82495}{82573}Whatever we did.
{82975}{83041}Now may I have the continuum transfunctioner?
{83047}{83123}Not quite yet.
{83215}{83257}Scary dream, huh?
{83263}{83329}What's up? My name is Mark.
{83335}{83377}Where are we?
{83383}{83433}You're in punishment room.
{83439}{83520}This is where he likes to|keep the ostrich poachers.
{83526}{83544}Poachers?
{83550}{83568}Yeah. That's right.
{83574}{83664}You know, I've been in this cage for about three years|five months and seventeen days...
{83670}{83753}...but who's counting...
{83759}{83826}How's my breath?
{83838}{83880}That bad, huh?
{83886}{83952}Where are you guys from?|I'm from Connecticut, hi, Mark.
{83958}{84004}There we go.
{84010}{84048}Chester!
{84054}{84078}Get him off.
{84084}{84144}Pierre.
{84150}{84168}Hi.
{84174}{84240}No, that's not what it looks |like. Maybe a little bit.
{84246}{84254}How is your now?
{84260}{84312}Shut up!
{84318}{84426}Well, somebody sure is a grumpy gasp today.
{84437}{84527}In France when a man is caught poaching ostriches.
{84533}{84647}...we shave his head and we|make him to run through the fields.
{84653}{84695}Oh God, that's the good part.
{84701}{84788}Once you have seen this...
{84797}{84863}...you are never quite the same.
{84869}{84891}OK.
{84897}{84935}Tell me about it. I used to model.
{84941}{85007}Lucky for you I am an honorable man.
{85013}{85055}What? I'm sorry.
{85061}{85127}I said I am an honorable man.
{85133}{85188}I'm sorry, an honograbbbble?

{85301}{85343}Honorable! Honorable!|- ^%$@^@
{85349}{85391}I think you're trying to say honorable.
{85397}{85414}Shut up!
{85420}{85462}Hey, I'm sorry.
{85468}{85548}Right, hear this. I am going to ask you a question.
{85554}{85630}If you get it right I will set you free.
{85636}{85654}If you get it wrong...
{85660}{85726}...well, you will be spending a lot of time with the...
{85732}{85815}...ever popular Mark.
{85828}{85894}I can be very nice.
{85900}{85918}Alright, here it is:
{85924}{86012}What is the average running speed...
{86018}{86110}...of a full grown male african ostrich?
{86116}{86206}Pass. Pass to me. I know it.
{86212}{86230}Pass to Mark.
{86236}{86254}You can not pass!
{86260}{86326}Shut up. What do I have to do to shut you up?|Do I have to hose you down again?
{86332}{86398}Don't hose me. Maybe later.
{86404}{86439}Dude, we're dead.
{86445}{86517}Not so fast.
{86523}{86637}The full grown male african ostrich or the latin "struthio camelus"|can go to an average size of sixty six inches...
{86643}{86709}...and weight anywhere from 225 to|350 pounds that can get up to....
{86715}{86781}...well an average speed of...
{86787}{86829}...27 miles per hour.
{86835}{86891}This is absolutely correct.
{86897}{86925}Animal Planet!
{86931}{86973}Well. I said brown.
{86979}{87069}Here, let me get you out of this stinky cage.

{91633}{91700}Hey, look at these.
{91701}{91767}Dude, we speak Japanese.
{91773}{91841}Sweet!
{91917}{91983}I don't see a continuum transfunctioner in here.
{91989}{92055}Wait a second. What do we|know about the continuum transfunctioner?
{92061}{92151}That it's a very mysterious and powerful device...|- and?
{92157}{92199}and it's mystery is only exceeded by it's power.
{92205}{92331}Right!|But has anyone ever said|anything about what it looks like?
{92349}{92414}No.
{92594}{92826}That was Jesse and Chester. They've|got the continuum transfunctioner.
{92856}{92957}Quick, to my mother's minivan.
{93020}{93150}That was Jesse and Chester. They've|got the continuum transfunctioner.
{93164}{93261}Quick, to my stepdad's pickup truck.
{93293}{93397}I'm really getting a hang on this thing dude.
{93403}{93469}Yes!
{93499}{93591}Yes, I finally beat you.
{93619}{93665}You... You're a competitor.
{93671}{93761}Oh, boy, you got me the first nine, but not number ten.
{93767}{93829}Not gonna happen.
{93835}{93853}Time for the final showdown.
{93859}{93877}Chester, Jesse.
{93883}{93973}Don't worry girls. We're here to save the day.
{93979}{94069}Quit it. These things are expensive.
{94075}{94189}Enough. You have the continuum|transfunctioner or not?
{94247}{94285}Now, release our girlfriends.

{95777}{95819}Yeah, we've already met.

{96065}{96117}Halt. Where is the continuum transfunctioner?
{96123}{96203}Well, you wanna go talk to that guy over there.
{96209}{96241}Let the pleasure begin.
{96247}{96299}That is not the continuum transfunctioner.
{96305}{96383}Of course it is.
{96448}{96533}Follow the kids.|Come on. Follow. Go. Go.
{96856}{96898}Nerd bashing time.

{97144}{97162}You ordered pizza?
{97168}{97210}Yeah. I figured we'd get hungry.
{97216}{97262}Oh, no! It's you two!
{97268}{97306}Look dude, I almost got it.

{97407}{97475}Sweet!
{97503}{97569}Wow!
{97743}{97809}No wonder those things are so impossible.
{97815}{97857}Oh no, you've activated the|continuum transfunctioner.
{97863}{97881}Alright, what's going on?
{97887}{97966}Once all five of the Darusi|Crystals stop flashing the...
{97972}{98025}...universe is going to be destroyed.
{98031}{98049}How do you know all that?
{98055}{98097}We've been intercepting|interstellar transmissions for years.
{98103}{98145}Zoltan!
{98151}{98169}Nerds.
{98175}{98217}Way to go Chester.
{98223}{98265}I'm sorry.
{98271}{98361}Quickly. You must give it to us so we can deactivate it.|We are the keepers of the continuum transfunctioner.
{98367}{98408}They will use it to destroy the universe.
{98414}{98508}No. We are the keepers of the|continuum transfunctioner.
{98514}{98552}They want to destroy the universe.
{98558}{98576}Stop copying us.
{98582}{98600}Stop copying us.
{98606}{98634}Stop copying us.
{98640}{98672}Stop copying us.
{98678}{98720}Bitch.
{98726}{98744}Don't you guys remember?
{98750}{98867}We came to this planet last night to escape|the clutches of those evil space sluts.
{98873}{98936}We met you here at the space-o-rama|and then|you gave us a ride back to our space ship...
{98942}{99056}...and that's when we realized that|we had lost the continuum transfunctioner.
{99062}{99128}Hurry, there's only three blinking lights left.
{99134}{99166}Bye, bye universe.
{99172}{99248}He's right dude. We're gonna make the wrong decision.
{99254}{99391}You know what dude. I refuse to let us go down|in history|as the dudes who destroyed the universe.
{99397}{99487}How do we figure out which ones are the true keepers|of the continuum transfunctioner?
{99493}{99535}Well, it's... it's simple.
{99541}{99655}We just ask them a question about last night|that only the ones that are telling the truth would know.
{99661}{99727}But we can't remember a thing.
{99733}{99751}You gotta hurry.
{99757}{99832}Not now Jeff.
{99877}{99943}If we really did give one|of you guys a ride last night...
{99949}{100055}...then you'll know the answer to this question:
{100069}{100111}Hurry!
{100117}{100291}What score did we get on the eighteenth|hole of the miniature goIf course last night?
{100432}{100452}You got the hole-in-one.
{100458}{100494}That....
{100500}{100570}...is...
{100592}{100650}...correct.
{100884}{100968}Deactivation complete.
{101148}{101238}Wait a second. If you guys don't|remember a thing about last night...
{101244}{101286}...how do you know they were telling the truth?
{101292}{101334}Well, it's simple really.
{101340}{101358}The pudding!
{101364}{101429}Wow, you guys had a plan!
{101435}{101520}And it actually worked.

{102370}{102411}That is amazing.|- Yeah.
{102417}{102525}Those are the biggest hoohoos I have ever seen.
{102753}{102833}We will now use the power of the|continuum transfunctioner|to punish you to hook
{102839}{102954}of the New Jersey..
{102992}{103059}What are we supposed to do now?

{104120}{104138}Hey, what do I do with this thing?
{104144}{104234}You gotta activate the PHOTON|ACCELERATOR ANNIHILATION BEAM.
{104240}{104258}The what?
{104264}{104343}They said: the PHOTON|ACCELERATOR ANNIHILATION BEAM
