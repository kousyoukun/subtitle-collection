1
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,410
What's up?

2
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:50,944
Animal Planet.

3
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,616
Man, I just had the craziest dream.

4
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,823
- About what?
- I don't remember.

5
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,083
Yeah. Yeah.

6
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,252
Morning, guys.

7
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,089
Morning, Gene.

8
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:08,435
What did we do last night?

9
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:10,069
I don't know.

10
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:13,602
Wait. Didn't the twins have a party?

11
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,878
Yeah, that's it. Twins had a party.

12
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,909
- Right.
- Right.

13
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:20,309
Were we there?

14
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,843
I'm assuming we were.

15
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:25,712
What kind of boyfriends
would we be if we weren't?

16
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,090
Did I get any messages?

17
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:29,849
Nope.

18
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:33,825
See you tomorrow, Gene.

19
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:35,754
Shibby.

20
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:40,065
How do you know Gene?

21
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,331
Oh, I thought he was your friend.

22
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:45,699
No, no, I don't know him.

23
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,140
I'm starving.

24
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,779
- It's pudding.
- I always wondered what a fridge...

25
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,284
...full of pudding would look like.

26
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,087
Is it possible that we got
so wasted last night...

27
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:09,991
...we bought a lifetime supply
of pudding and then forgot about it?

28
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:15,298
I'd say it's entirely possible.

29
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,368
- Jesse.
- And Chester are shibby right now.

30
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,908
Please leave your shibby at the beep.
Shibby.

31
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,143
What happened last night?

32
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:30,011
You show up with a bunch of people,
pizzas and a keg. Our house is trashed.

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,084
You're sucky boyfriends.
Always disappointing us.

34
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,120
Now you're probably on the couch
in your underwear.

35
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:37,484
Playing thumb wars.

36
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:39,194
Wearing those Army helmets.

37
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:42,623
And if you are, you've probably
forgotten our anniversary.

38
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,093
Which is today.

39
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,165
You don't get the special treats
we had for you.

40
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:50,338
Just wanted to thank you guys
for trashing our house.

41
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:51,766
Bye!

42
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,401
Twins sound pissed.

43
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,976
- Good thing we already got them gifts.
- Yeah.

44
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,840
So where are the gifts?

45
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,946
- They must be in your car.
- They're in the car.

46
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:08,121
So we'll just take the gifts
to the twins' house...

47
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,686
...get our special treats.

48
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,655
Hey, what do you think they mean
by special treats?

49
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,363
We've been going out with them
for a year now.

50
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,258
And we still haven't had sex.

51
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,498
"Special treats" is code for sex.

52
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,362
Of course.

53
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,903
- Special treats!
- Sex.

54
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,506
Open up, you slackers!

55
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:29,137
Mr. Pizzacoli!

56
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,778
You left work last night...

57
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:33,172
...with 30 pizzas
that didn't get delivered!

58
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,849
I want some answers!

59
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,676
Open up this damn door!

60
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:38,921
It's open.

61
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,087
- Moron!
- What? I'm sorry.

62
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,738
Mr. Pizzacoli.

63
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,906
- Hi, how you doing?
- 30 pizzas didn't get delivered!

64
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,741
If I found out you was taking
my pizza home to eat yourselves...

65
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:05,071
...I will crush you like a doodlebug!

66
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,941
- Look, it's an elephant!
- What?

67
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:13,781
- Guess it was just a mailman.
- You two are the most irresponsible...

68
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,820
...and disappointing employees
ever to work...

69
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,584
...at Mr. Pizzacoli's
Pronto Pizza Delivery!

70
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,389
A trained dolphin could do
a better job than you!

71
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,762
Well, sure, but then the pizzas
would get all wet.

72
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:27,399
Look, a unicorn!

73
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:31,240
A unicorn?

74
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,806
Sorry, I guess it was just
a regular horse. Weird!

75
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:36,943
You've been embezzling my pizza.

76
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,511
And I will catch you eventually.

77
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:43,377
And when I do, I swear to God,
you will never deliver pizzas...

78
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,950
...in this town again!

79
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,516
- Close one.
- Yeah.

80
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,357
We'll go to the twins' house.

81
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:59,123
We'll give them their gifts
and apologize for trashing the house.

82
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:01,700
And then we get our special treats.

83
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,737
Dude, where's my car?

84
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,305
Where's your car, dude?

85
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:10,709
Dude, where's my car?

86
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,944
Where's your car, dude?

87
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,109
Dude, where's my car?

88
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:17,849
Where's your car, dude?

89
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,682
- Did I drive last night?
- Yeah, I think so.

90
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,857
- Really?
- I'm not sure.

91
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:29,094
- Dude, where's your car?
- Dude, it's not funny. It's gone.

92
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,825
- Yeah.
- Dude, where's my car?

93
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,397
Shut up, dude!

94
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:38,264
Okay. Okay, look.

95
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,873
You're right.
What we need to do is...

96
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,738
...get into the state of mind
we were in last night.

97
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,946
That way, we can retrace our steps.

98
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,245
- Yeah.
- Sense Memory Simulated Perception...

99
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,987
...AItered Consciousness
Memory Retrieval.

100
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,118
Discovery Channel.

101
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:56,857
Nice.

102
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:59,151
- Nelson's?
- Shibby.

103
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,935
- I'm sick of walking, dude.
- Me too.

104
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:12,805
Hey, it's Mrs. Crabbleman.
She'll give us a ride.

105
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,406
Hey, Mrs. Crabbleman!

106
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:17,002
Hey! Hey!

107
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,006
Mrs. Crabbleman.

108
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:29,356
Fucking stoners.

109
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,292
She must not have recognized you.

110
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,190
- It's the Binglemans.
- Oh, hey.

111
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,954
Mr. Bingleman!

112
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:40,032
Hey, Mr. Bingleman.

113
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,635
- Maybe we should just walk.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,706
Listen, Nelson, the car is gone...

115
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,445
...and we need to do
this sense memory thing...

116
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,946
...so we can get back in the state
of mind we were in last night.

117
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,883
Deep in your consciousness,
you must look.

118
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:03,452
Concentrate on the knowledge inside,
you must.

119
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,287
Your eyes, you must close.

120
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,554
And you take it to the mo.

121
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,703
Whoops.

122
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:30,675
Concentrating, you're not.

123
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,714
Sorry.

124
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,582
- Is your dog dead?
- He's not dead.

125
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,089
Come here, Jackal. Come here, boy.

126
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,862
- I don't think he's coming.
- Maybe he's deaf.

127
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,324
Deaf, he is not, dude.

128
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:43,596
Come here, Jackal.

129
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,367
- Come here, Jackal.
- Does he know any other tricks...

130
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,160
...besides not moving?

131
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:51,395
All right, you want
to see a trick, man?

132
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,663
Hey, Jackal.

133
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:00,011
Bite down, killer.

134
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:02,376
Here comes the fun. All right.

135
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:07,988
Good boy, Jackal.

136
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,986
Good boy.

137
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:13,456
Breathe deep. There you go.

138
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:17,028
- Dude, your dog's a stoner.
- Can he also bong a beer?

139
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,860
Nah, pretty much all he does is...

140
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,694
...lie around and smoke his pipe.

141
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:23,529
Jackal, can I see your pipe?

142
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:28,334
Oh, no, don't!
Very protective, he is of his pipe.

143
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:32,103
When other people touch it,
he does not like.

144
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,507
Sorry, Jackal.

145
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,448
Yeah, see? He's sorry.

146
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:38,317
Holy crap.

147
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,990
- That's one psycho dog, dude.
- You know what we should do now?

148
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,055
- Eat?
- No. Eat.

149
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:50,031
Choice excellent, my friend.
I'll get the keys.

150
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,717
Hey, Nelson. Let me order.

151
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:13,686
"Chinese Foooood." May I help you?

152
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:16,389
- I'd like to place an order.
- What you like?

153
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,116
Yeah, I'd like three orders
of garlic chicken.

154
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,056
- And then?
- And then three orders of white rice.

155
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:25,892
- And then?
- And then...

156
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,932
- Hey, you guys want soup?
- Sure.

157
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:31,230
- Yeah. Three orders of won ton soup.
- And then?

158
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,701
- Oh, some fortune cookies too.
- And then?

159
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:37,379
That's about it.

160
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:38,738
And then?

161
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,482
No, that's it.

162
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,242
- And then?
- No "and then."

163
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,511
L... That's all I want.

164
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,847
And then?

165
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:54,796
And then... And then nothing else,
because I'm done ordering. Okay?

166
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:56,497
And then?

167
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,698
See, all I want is the three orders
of the garlic chicken...

168
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,961
...and the white rice.

169
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:05,396
And then?

170
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:08,472
- And the soup, dude.
- Oh, and the won ton soup.

171
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,143
- And then?
- And the cookies, fortune.

172
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,745
And the fortune cookies.

173
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:16,313
So it's just the chicken, the rice...

174
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:19,316
...the soup and the fortune cookies,
and that's it.

175
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,647
And then?

176
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,761
And then you can put it
in a brown paper bag...

177
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,828
...and put it in my hand,
because I'm ready to eat.

178
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,924
And then?

179
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,335
I refuse to play
your Chinese food mind games.

180
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,233
- And then?
- No! No "and then"!

181
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,772
- And then?
- No "and then"!

182
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:43,977
- And then?
- No "and then"!

183
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,703
- And then?
- No! No "and then"!

184
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,507
- And then?
- You're starting to piss me off, lady.

185
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:52,016
- And then?
- And then...

186
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:56,018
...I'm gonna come in there
and put my foot in your ass...

187
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,886
...if you say "and then" again!

188
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:07,163
And then and then
and then and then and then...

189
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,241
And then?

190
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,243
Come on, Nelson,
just help us find my car.

191
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,678
You didn't have to go all "egg roll"
on that speaker box.

192
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:25,579
I'm not the one that called
the Dalai Lama a fag.

193
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:29,848
- I was just kidding around.
- Well, Nelson didn't appreciate it.

194
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:33,522
Look, it's Christie Boner.

195
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,465
Wow! The hottest of the hot.

196
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,264
El fuego of all that is el fuego.

197
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:52,970
- Did she just wave at us?
- No way. She would never wave at us.

198
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,046
Then why did she just wave at us?

199
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:58,013
I don't know. Maybe she thinks
we're other people.

200
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,412
People she waves to.

201
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:06,484
Hi, Chester.

202
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,252
Hi.

203
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:12,191
Hi, Jesse. I had a really
good time with you last night.

204
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,563
- Me too.
- That was some crazy party.

205
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,366
- Hey, have you seen my car?
- Well, I saw it last night.

206
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,875
I mean, I saw the back seat.

207
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:29,014
- I mean the whole thing.
- Get another one with all the money...

208
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:31,513
...you were throwing around.
- Money?

209
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:34,951
Yeah. You had that really nice
suitcase full of money.

210
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:40,394
- A suitcase full of money?
- Don't you remember giving me $500...

211
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,756
...to show you my hoo-hoos?

212
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:46,326
- $500?
- Hoo-hoos?

213
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,231
You mean, you don't remember anything?

214
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,241
How about now?

215
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:03,676
No.

216
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,321
How about now?

217
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,193
I'm a little bit fuzzy too.

218
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,555
Maybe if I could get
a little refresher course.

219
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,694
- All right.
- Go.

220
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,069
- Are these losers bothering you?
- No, Tommy.

221
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,243
Guys like you could never score
with a chick like this.

222
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,139
- Stick to your own kind.
- Don't be such a jerk.

223
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,644
Next time you guys
bother my girlfriend...

224
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,976
...stoner-bashing time.
- Oh, yeah?

225
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,413
Yeah.

226
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:42,552
- Okay.
- Consider this your warning.

227
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,093
Later, dudes!

228
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:53,133
Dude, you touched
Christie Boner's hoo-hoo.

229
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:54,528
Shibby!

230
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,100
Low-five.

231
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,333
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here.

232
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,308
Chester!

233
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,441
Dude, that Christie Boner
is super hot.

234
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,978
Where did we get a suitcase
full of money?

235
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,547
Why don't we have it now?

236
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,616
Maybe we deposited it
in a Swiss bank account.

237
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:17,790
Now, if we had a ridiculous
sum of money, where would we go?

238
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:19,754
Dude.

239
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,096
Sweet!

240
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,366
No way we were here last night.

241
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,578
We'd never fit in
at a place like this.

242
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:41,282
Look everyone!
It's Mr. Jesse and Mr. Chester!

243
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,257
Look at the toggles on that kitten.

244
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,466
Good afternoon, Jesse, Chester.
How are we feeling today?

245
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,795
A little fuzzy.

246
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,638
Hi, Chester. Hi, Jesse.

247
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:12,107
Did you guys enjoy
yourselves last night?

248
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,541
- Have we met?
- It's me, Tania.

249
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,650
Remember last night
when I gave you...

250
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,617
...that super-special,
slippery-wet lapdance?

251
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,086
Of course. How can I forget?

252
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,790
You want to do it again?

253
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:35,229
This time, it's on me.

254
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,536
If you say so.

255
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,154
Didn't I get a special lapdance?

256
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,219
Did you ever.

257
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,638
Sweet!

258
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,530
Sweet!

259
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,641
So...

260
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:19,937
...just how super-special
can a slippery lapdance be?

261
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:24,613
What the hell were you thinking,
throwing around my money like that?

262
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,412
- You're a...
- I'm a gender-challenged male.

263
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:30,414
What does that mean?

264
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,386
Oh, dude, you're a dude! That's...

265
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:36,856
You...

266
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:50,536
Last night, I had you sneak a suitcase
of stolen money out of here.

267
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,373
- Stolen money?
- $200,000.

268
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:54,977
$200,000!

269
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,378
I gave you the case and left.
We were supposed to meet.

270
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:01,646
But you never showed up!
Where's that suitcase?

271
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,682
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

272
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,298
- Where's that suitcase?
- It's in my car.

273
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,031
Then get it. Fast.
Or else you'll be singing soprano.

274
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,057
Dude. Dude, dude!

275
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,957
- We gotta go.
- Are you crazy?

276
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:40,124
I'm with breakdancing strippers.

277
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:42,556
Seriously, dude, this is an emergency.

278
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:43,924
So is this, dude.

279
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,827
It's a breakdancing
stripper emergency.

280
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:50,168
- Goodbye!
- Bye, Chester!

281
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:51,939
I love you!

282
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:57,142
We were supposed to meet her with
the suitcase, but we didn't show up.

283
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,514
Sounds like us.
How wasted were we last night?

284
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,013
I touched Christie's hoo-hoo,
we're on the hook for $200,000...

285
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,413
...that belongs to a transsexual
stripper, and my car's gone.

286
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:11,825
- I'd say we were pretty wasted.
- We really need to find your car.

287
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,961
Okay, let's see. The last place
we remember being last night was...

288
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:20,258
The twins'. But we can't show up
without the anniversary gifts.

289
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:23,403
I got it! We'll get them
a little something for now.

290
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:27,938
When we find the car, we'll give them
the real gifts. That's a dollar...

291
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:29,605
...thirty-nine.

292
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,380
- I don't know.
- Trust me.

293
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,014
- It'll be totally cool. Let's go.
- Okay.

294
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,418
We are so dead.

295
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:43,684
I roger that.

296
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:07,609
- We've been cleaning all day.
- What do you guys have to say?

297
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,009
Happy anniversary.

298
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,050
We ate the dark ones.
We know you guys don't like those.

299
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,724
Dark ones are the only ones
we do like.

300
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,296
Oh, yeah.

301
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,159
But you could use the box to keep...

302
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:32,066
You keep...

303
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:34,739
...ribbons.

304
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:39,645
- You guys forgot our anniversary.
- No, of course not.

305
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:43,349
No, we got you guys great gifts.
We just had some car trouble.

306
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,576
We came over here
as soon as we could...

307
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,685
...to help you guys clean up but...

308
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,121
Oh, no.

309
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:52,718
It looks like you're already done.

310
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:55,087
All we have to do is
take out the trash.

311
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,423
Guess they haven't been outside yet.

312
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,892
You know what?
We'll take out the trash.

313
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,135
You guys go and take a nice hot bath.

314
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:05,200
Yeah. You deserve it
after all this hard work.

315
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:06,668
Pamper yourselves.

316
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,273
- Just...
- Don't make a mess.

317
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:16,311
Slow and steady, good buddy.

318
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:17,643
10-4.

319
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,710
- You're tilting.
- Sorry.

320
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,684
- Why are you tilting?
- You gave me the heavy end.

321
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,224
- Let it go, man.
- No, we can get it.

322
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:33,696
No. Let it go.

323
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,002
We're not leaving it behind.

324
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:38,203
Okay.

325
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,135
- I'll take my shoe off.
- Okay.

326
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,545
Watch it. Stop pushing!

327
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,046
Watch it! Careful. Careful.

328
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,587
- Are we cool? Are we cool?
- We're still cool.

329
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,958
Now, take your shoe off,
and you get it.

330
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,603
- Okay.
- Get it. That's it, that's it.

331
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,435
I got it!

332
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:17,943
Oh, my God!

333
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,313
You can't do anything right.

334
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,715
Why do you have to mess everything up?

335
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,530
- I got three words: Anger management.
- Yeah!

336
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:48,537
Dude, we really need
to find your car.

337
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,411
Sorry about yanking you
off the street like that.

338
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,485
- We really need to talk to you.
- Who are you guys?

339
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:05,783
My name is Zarnoff. This is Zabu,
Zellner, Zilbor, Zelmina...

340
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:07,595
...and Jeff.
- Hey.

341
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:13,530
More specifically, we are
the recipients of instructions...

342
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:18,228
...from extraterrestrials regarding
the interstellar path to outer space.

343
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:21,434
Go ahead and laugh.

344
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,678
We are used to being mocked.

345
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,710
Okay.

346
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:29,345
We have been sent
by our wise and powerful leader...

347
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:30,551
...Zoltan...

348
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:34,346
...to find you and recover
the continuum transfunctioner.

349
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:37,657
Hey, have you guys
ever been to Uranus?

350
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,450
It's supposed to be
nice this time of year.

351
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:43,823
This is important. We intercepted
an interstellar message...

352
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,397
...that leads us to believe
that last night...

353
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:49,933
...you were in possession
of the continuum transfunctioner.

354
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,194
Where is it now?

355
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,008
- The who what?
- The continuum transfunctioner...

356
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:56,676
...is a very mysterious
and powerful device.

357
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:58,878
- And?
- And its mystery...

358
00:24:59,347 --> 00:25:01,577
...is exceeded only by its power.

359
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,545
Sorry, we don't remember
a thing about last night.

360
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:05,980
You must be careful.

361
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:10,019
Danger follows the continuum
transfunctioner. So says...

362
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,658
- Zoltan.
- Zoltan.

363
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:14,894
I'll tell you what.

364
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:18,894
We'll keep our eyes out for the
continual trans-ding-a-ling thing...

365
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:21,295
...and if we see it,
we'll give you a call.

366
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,730
Yes. You must.

367
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,234
But remember,
you are in great danger.

368
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:26,667
Trust no one.

369
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,134
Except for us.

370
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,934
Thank you, Jeff. Good point.

371
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:32,339
Trust no one, except for us.

372
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:34,044
Zoltan.

373
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,425
Wait a second. Let's recap.
Last night, we lost my car...

374
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,389
...we accepted stolen money
from a transsexual stripper...

375
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:51,792
...and now some space nerds want us
to find something we can't pronounce.

376
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:54,565
Maybe we should cut back
on the shibbying.

377
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:59,333
- Thanks, dude.
- Oh, good!

378
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:02,837
You're right on time.
You pick up special suits.

379
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:07,606
Mr. Lee, tailor, make special
suits for you. Come on.

380
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:18,315
- Dude, you got a tattoo!
- What?

381
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,994
- So did you, dude.
- Naw.

382
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:24,959
- Dude, what does my tattoo say?
- "Sweet"!

383
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:27,497
- What about mine?
- "Dude." What does mine say?

384
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:28,793
"Sweet."

385
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,264
- What about mine?
- "Dude."

386
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:32,039
- What does mine say?
- "Sweet"!

387
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:34,207
- What about mine?
- "Dude." And mine?

388
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,204
"Sweet." What about mine?

389
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:37,911
"Dude." What does mine say?

390
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,976
"Sweet"! What about mine?

391
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,079
"Dude." What does mine say?

392
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,978
"Sweet"! What about mine?

393
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:48,149
"Dude"! What does mine say?

394
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:49,980
"Sweet"!

395
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:52,816
Idiots!

396
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:57,930
Your tattoo says "dude,"
your tattoo says "sweet."

397
00:26:58,667 --> 00:26:59,861
Got it?

398
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,198
Sorry.

399
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,099
- Hey.
- Hey.

400
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:08,336
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

401
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:18,484
- Shibby.
- Very sharp, very sharp.

402
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,688
You two number one, extra-special
good-Iooking guys.

403
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,424
- We got these last night?
- You were pretty...

404
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:28,755
- How much are these?
- You already pay for.

405
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:33,261
I just do some minor alterations.
Add the secret pockets you order.

406
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:36,068
Maybe we got
the continual trans-sphincter.

407
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:37,396
What's...?

408
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,371
Oh, dude!

409
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:45,035
Dude!

410
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:54,511
Sweet!

411
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:11,772
Cool!

412
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,100
- How did we pay for these suits?
- Oh, you pay cash.

413
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:19,074
Cold hard cash,
crispy new hundred-dollar bills.

414
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,449
Hey, did you see
what car we were driving?

415
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:24,614
Me? No, I don't see no car.

416
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:32,720
Hello?

417
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,362
Dude, we bought cell phones.

418
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,867
That's not all we bought, dude.

419
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:30,250
Shibby!

420
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:51,764
Man, I cannot believe
we leased a car last night. God!

421
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,560
- But who's Johnny Potsmoker?
- That's my alter ego.

422
00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:56,463
I thought that was my alter ego.

423
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,966
No, that's my alter ego.

424
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,107
- Your alter ego is Smokey McPot.
- Oh, yeah.

425
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:05,745
You're never gonna figure that out.

426
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:07,738
Okay, dude.

427
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:10,313
There it is. Break time's over.

428
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:12,213
Time to find my car.

429
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,645
This is impossible.

430
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,155
Are you Jesse and Chester?

431
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:21,889
Are you Jesse and Chester?

432
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,061
I don't know. Why?

433
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,200
If you are Jesse and Chester...

434
00:31:27,502 --> 00:31:29,902
...perhaps we will give you
erotic pleasure.

435
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:31,666
- That's us.
- Right here.

436
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,704
We are looking
for the continuum transfunctioner.

437
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:39,275
- Who are you guys?
- We are not guys. We are hot chicks.

438
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,941
She's totally right.

439
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,842
The continuum transfunctioner...

440
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:46,109
...is a very mysterious
and powerful device.

441
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,281
- And?
- And its mystery...

442
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,114
...is only exceeded by its power.

443
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,890
That doesn't really help.

444
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:16,843
We will give you pleasure now, if you
give us the continuum transfunctioner.

445
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,848
Let me get your proposition straight.
First you give us...

446
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:24,647
...the pleasure, then we give
you the continuum transfunctioner?

447
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:28,054
No. First you give us
the continuum transfunctioner...

448
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:30,490
...then we give you the pleasure.

449
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:32,700
I've heard that one before.

450
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:34,525
Okay, look. How about this?

451
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:37,101
You give me pleasure...

452
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:40,272
...then we'll give you
the continuum transfunctioner.

453
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,771
- Lf there's time, you do him.
- Dude...

454
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:44,442
- Deal.
- Sweet!

455
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:46,237
- Wait a second.
- Thank you.

456
00:32:46,514 --> 00:32:49,677
Come here. Those space nerds
told us not to trust anybody.

457
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:54,478
Yeah, but for the love of God,
they're offering us oral pleasure!

458
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,053
What...?

459
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,856
- Okay.
- Okay.

460
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,220
Hey. Where did the hot chicks go?

461
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:05,823
Where's my money, boys?

462
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:09,000
We were just going to get it.

463
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:13,172
You picked the wrong
transsexual stripper to screw with.

464
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,271
You're pinching me.

465
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:19,571
Well, let's see what the cops
have to say about this.

466
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:22,278
- You're busted.
- Busted.

467
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:26,075
- B-U-S-T, busted.
- This one.

468
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:30,082
- These guys.
- Chester! I saw this on COPs!

469
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:33,122
- IKick hard and hit back!
- Bye-bye, boys.

470
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:34,852
Put on the siren.

471
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,627
You're sticking to the
"I don't remember" crap.

472
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,299
Yeah. We don't remember.

473
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,661
Last night, your car
was spotted leaving...

474
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,066
...the scene of a major drug deal.
- You found my car.

475
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,708
You guys got more important things
to worry about right now.

476
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:54,272
Where were you between
midnight and 2 a.m. Last night?

477
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:58,415
I told you, okay?
We don't remember anything.

478
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:01,553
I see we're gonna have to do
this the hard way.

479
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:07,451
Where were you last night between
the hours of midnight and 2 a. M?

480
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:09,660
We don't know.

481
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,296
What the...?

482
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,410
- Now do you remember?
- No.

483
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,256
- How about now?
- No.

484
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:52,667
Hey, leave him alone!
He doesn't know anything!

485
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,973
- Now are you ready to talk?
- Dude, we don't remember!

486
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,806
Okay, here are the whips
you guys wanted.

487
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:04,975
Hey, it's the donut guys.

488
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,918
These two were at
the Donut House last night.

489
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,717
We started talking and they bought
donuts for the whole precinct.

490
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:14,962
What time did all this happen?

491
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:18,130
Let's see. Must've been
between midnight and 2 a.m.

492
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,093
Damn!

493
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,993
You can't be the guys
we're looking for. Sorry.

494
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:31,702
Hang in there, bro.

495
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,380
- Come on, IKojak.
- All right.

496
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,018
I'm really sorry about all this.

497
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:40,846
Looks like it was a case
of mistaken identity.

498
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:44,023
Actually, those are
the real criminals over there.

499
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:46,685
One of our officers...

500
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:50,794
...made a wrong identification.
- Yeah, that was me.

501
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:52,556
I'm sorry about that, fellas.

502
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,166
Rick will tell you exactly
where your car is.

503
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,229
- We found the car.
- We found the car.

504
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:01,168
We found the car!

505
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:03,467
- Yeah, we found the car.
- Found my car.

506
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:07,976
Now we get the gifts, go to the twins'
house, and get our special treats.

507
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,614
Sweet!

508
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:12,545
Give us the keys
and we're out of here.

509
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:14,186
You got it.

510
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:19,258
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

511
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,891
What's the problem, Rick?

512
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,889
Nothing, I just... Boy.

513
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:24,756
Okay. Jeez.

514
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:30,163
Did you say you wanted your car back,
or you wanted it impounded?

515
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:33,504
We want the car back, please.

516
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,232
Oh, I see. That's kind of funny,
because what happened was...

517
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:41,345
...I accidentally sent your car
to the impound.

518
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,981
- Rick.
- I know.

519
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:45,515
I can definitely tell you this.
You guys...

520
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,913
...can get the car back in a few days.

521
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:51,555
We don't have a few days, Rick.
We need the car back now.

522
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:57,030
Say, how about a treat?
There's Bavarian cream.

523
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,735
- Yeah.
- That's a good one there.

524
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,766
- It's good.
- It's great. I have a lot of them.

525
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,939
- You know what? Forget about it.
- Okay.

526
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,573
- Psych!
- Oh, jeez. You got me.

527
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:12,108
Hey, fellows, who's the goose? Me.

528
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,908
You're such a joker.

529
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,549
One.

530
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,084
- Damn!
- Have you seen Jesse and Chester?

531
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:26,224
- What?
- We're looking for Jesse and Chester.

532
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:28,355
I don't know where they are...

533
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:30,756
...but I bet those punks
over there do.

534
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:35,261
So then, remember?
I said, "Later, dudes."

535
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,606
- Why were you with those jerks anyway?
- They were just being nice...

536
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:43,342
...unlike someone I know.

537
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:46,478
Maybe it's time I find someone
with a sensitive side.

538
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,042
Someone who respects me as a person.

539
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:51,649
Maybe somebody like Jesse or Chester.

540
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:58,482
Okay, listen up.
We're gonna find Jesse and Chester.

541
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:01,695
And when we do, stoner-bashing time!

542
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:04,794
- Do you know Jesse and Chester?
- Who are you?

543
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,160
- We are hot chicks.
- Yes, you are.

544
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:11,303
We believe they have
the continuum transfunctioner.

545
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,472
However, if you recover the continuum
transfunctioner from them...

546
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:18,644
...and bring it to us,
we will give you erotic pleasure.

547
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,675
You've got yourselves a deal.

548
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:23,207
Okay, guys. Okay, guys, new plan.

549
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:27,251
First, we find those stoners,
get the continuum transfunctioner...

550
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:30,513
...then, it's jerk-bashing time.
- Yeah!

551
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,491
Oh, yeah.

552
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,820
I just remembered where
you might be able to find them.

553
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:37,896
Send those chicks to meet the twins.

554
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:40,664
That'll put those dudes
in some hot water.

555
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:46,269
Try it again. Okay?
Just knock it out of the park.

556
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,064
All right, give it a shot.

557
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:50,508
Okay, you almost got it.

558
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,476
Now just concentrate on the beep,
swing as hard as you can...

559
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,649
...and keep your ear on the ball.
Okay?

560
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:59,179
All right, little buddy,
you can do it!

561
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,419
I did it! I did it!
I hit it! I did it!

562
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:13,857
- Do you know Jesse and Chester?
- Pardon me?

563
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:17,534
- We're looking for Jesse and Chester.
- Who are you?

564
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,236
We're extremely hot chicks
with big breasts.

565
00:39:20,674 --> 00:39:21,971
Really?

566
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:25,904
Can I touch your face?
It's the only way I can see...

567
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,671
...who I'm talking to.
- Okay.

568
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:33,749
Wow! You are hot.

569
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:43,296
Is this normal?

570
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:46,791
Oh, yeah. This is how
blind people shake hands.

571
00:39:47,368 --> 00:39:49,097
- Sammy, you're up next.
- Okay...

572
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:51,667
- Come on.
- What the...? Sis!

573
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:55,504
Excuse me, a little help.
Wanda. Wilma.

574
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:58,439
- Anthony?
- Anthony, what is going on?

575
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:01,340
Nothing. I was just reading.

576
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,216
Bye, ladies, I need to be alone now.

577
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,648
- We're looking for Jesse and Chester.
- Who are you guys?

578
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:10,150
We are not guys. We are hot chicks.

579
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:13,656
We're supposed to meet them later,
but we can't wait.

580
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,594
- We don't know where they are.
- And frankly, we don't care.

581
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:25,969
- Dude, let's call Nelson.
- Yeah. See if he's home.

582
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,875
- Hello?
- Hey, Nelson, it's Chester.

583
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:34,476
Hey, Chester! No, it's me, Tommy.

584
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:37,175
Your buddy Nelson is busy
at the moment.

585
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:39,877
This is bad karma, boys.

586
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:43,654
Hey, tell me where
that continuum transfunctioner is.

587
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:46,323
No hablo English.

588
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,757
Your friend's dead meat unless
I get that continuum transfunctioner.

589
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:52,994
Jackal! Get your pipe!

590
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,162
- My balls!
- What was that?

591
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:01,465
Tommy's gotten to Nelson! He knows
about the continuum transfunctioner.

592
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,167
Those double-crossing
sexy, sexy sluts!

593
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:12,076
I am so sick of hearing about
this continuum transfunctioner thing.

594
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:16,221
- Lf one more person asks...
- You got the continuum transfunctioner?

595
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:18,023
Who are you guys?

596
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,455
We are the keepers
of the continuum transfunctioner.

597
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:25,530
It is all that stands between
the universe and destruction.

598
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,792
It is a mysterious
and powerful device.

599
00:41:28,102 --> 00:41:30,935
And its mystery
is only exceeded by its power.

600
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,570
- We know.
- We don't have it.

601
00:41:32,806 --> 00:41:33,704
But the universe?

602
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,066
Screw the universe.

603
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,944
Screw the universe?

604
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:59,795
Chimpanzees often use sticks
as crude tools.

605
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,262
That is one smart primate.

606
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

607
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,637
What are you doing here?

608
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,209
We just wanted to see
how that car trouble thing was going.

609
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:17,108
Oh, the car. It's in the shop.

610
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:18,316
Really?

611
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,417
The shop run by beautiful women
in black jumpsuits?

612
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:23,748
The ones you were
hanging with earlier?

613
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:27,357
- Well, you see, Jesse thought...
- Today's our anniversary.

614
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:30,428
- Not only do you not have gifts.
- But you guys ditch us...

615
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:32,097
...for some big-breasted bimbos...

616
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:35,233
...while we're cleaning our house...
- Which you trashed.

617
00:42:35,502 --> 00:42:36,662
Twice.

618
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,666
- You're sucky boyfriends.
- But...

619
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:42,932
We just wanted to come
and tell you in person that it's over.

620
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,375
- Wilma?
- Thank you, Wanda.

621
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,690
- They're totally right.
- Yeah.

622
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,053
We are sucky boyfriends.

623
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,466
Do you even remember
what kind of gifts we got them?

624
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,692
- I bet we got them sucky gifts.
- Yeah.

625
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:12,032
We suck.

626
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,738
Wait, I just got a really bad feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

627
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,147
You should go sit on the toilet.

628
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:28,247
No, no.
You know what the feeling is?

629
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:30,418
It's love.

630
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,357
- Is that what that is?
- Yeah.

631
00:43:34,628 --> 00:43:37,688
I'm in love with Wanda.
And you're in love with Wilma.

632
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:40,190
But see, now that we know...

633
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:43,334
...that we've been sucky boyfriends,
we can change.

634
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:46,334
- We can?
- Yeah. And you know what else?

635
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:50,168
I'll bet you that we did buy them
super-cool anniversary gifts.

636
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:52,536
You know why? Because we love them.

637
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,710
Are they wrapped in cool paper?

638
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,244
Yeah. I'll tell you what we'll do.

639
00:43:57,685 --> 00:44:01,143
We'll go to the impound lot, get the car,
which has the gifts in it...

640
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:05,085
...and then go to the twins' house,
and beg for them to take us back!

641
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,557
Yeah! Let's do it.

642
00:44:08,796 --> 00:44:11,788
No, hold on. I gotta take a crap.

643
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:13,259
- Told you.
- I know.

644
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,398
I know your body.

645
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:30,181
Boys, I got some good news.
We just got your car in this morning.

646
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:31,913
All right!

647
00:44:32,186 --> 00:44:33,710
But the bad news is...

648
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:37,150
...not only did Officer Boyer
send your car to the impound...

649
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,621
...he tagged it for auction
and it was sold this afternoon.

650
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:41,993
Rick.

651
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:47,065
- Do you know who bought the car?
- I have the address right here.

652
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:48,926
All right.

653
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:51,569
But it'd be against Regulation...

654
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:55,297
...457XY2-665 to give it to you.

655
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,940
Come on. Just...

656
00:44:58,645 --> 00:45:01,409
Reaching onto this side
of the counter isn't allowed.

657
00:45:01,749 --> 00:45:05,310
The last guy who tried it ended up
with three broken fingers.

658
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:11,413
- Reach it.
- You can reach it!

659
00:45:11,658 --> 00:45:14,024
No, I got...
One of these has carpal tunnel.

660
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,819
What if I further injure myself?

661
00:45:18,499 --> 00:45:19,727
I have to do everything.

662
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:23,434
I'm a better lookout.
My vision's better. You know that.

663
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:27,404
That's it, that's it.

664
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,438
- Got it!
- We're good, we're good.

665
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:36,815
- What are you doing?
- Dude, I'm stuck!

666
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:40,947
- Come on. I'm stuck.
- You seriously stuck?

667
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,312
Don't!

668
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:47,226
Dude, here she comes! Help!

669
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,652
Get it!

670
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,139
Hold on, hold on. I gotta get...

671
00:45:59,406 --> 00:46:00,930
Okay, okay.

672
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:05,011
- I got it, I got it.
- Help me!

673
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:07,645
We'll spit on it.
You know, lubrication.

674
00:46:07,915 --> 00:46:09,678
- That's gross, dude!
- Okay, fine.

675
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:13,015
- Here she comes.
- Spit! Spit!

676
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:18,951
Good news. I talked to my supervisor
and he said I could give you...

677
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:21,751
...the address after all.
- That's great.

678
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,062
But the bad news is...

679
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:28,902
...I'm gonna have to
confiscate your pinky.

680
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:48,284
- All right, next stop, find my car.
- Good.

681
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,888
Hey, check it out.
Totally gay Nordic dudes at 3:00.

682
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,296
Wait. I got an idea.

683
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,060
We just ask for
the continuum transfunctioner?

684
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:08,432
- Yeah. It's that easy.
- Thank you both very much.

685
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:12,270
- Hey, don't mention it.
- See you around the galaxy, dudes.

686
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:17,411
Time to get your car.

687
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,791
The creepy space nerds are back, dude.

688
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:41,637
Dude, do not worry about them.

689
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:44,104
Yeah, they're totally harmless.

690
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,796
Now may I have
the continuum transfunctioner?

691
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,128
Not quite yet.

692
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:13,029
Would you consider giving it to me
while I continue to give you pleasure?

693
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:15,397
Okay.

694
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,405
- Wake up, dude.
- Oral pleasure?

695
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:20,902
What?

696
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:23,573
Nothing.

697
00:48:25,185 --> 00:48:27,415
Get dressed.
We're going to the big house.

698
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:32,916
Nice outfits.

699
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:36,162
They're not outfits.
They're interstellar jumpsuits.

700
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,524
- Hey. Nice interstellar jumpsuits.
- Yeah.

701
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,941
Wow! Nice place.

702
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,768
Is this where Zoltan...?

703
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:54,639
- Is this where Zoltan hangs out?
- No.

704
00:48:55,048 --> 00:48:56,777
This is his parents' house.

705
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,574
We're going over there.

706
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,283
- A barn?
- Is it red?

707
00:49:02,556 --> 00:49:04,854
- No.
- Then it's not a barn!

708
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:14,662
- This is creepy.
- It's like a country music video.

709
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:18,864
All right, that's far enough.
You, there. You, over there.

710
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:20,868
No messing around.

711
00:49:21,975 --> 00:49:24,102
Okay, do you remember which one it is?

712
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:38,787
- Here, let me show you.
- I'll do it.

713
00:49:39,092 --> 00:49:40,889
- It's that one.
- Hey, grab the...

714
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,556
IKeys.

715
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,396
Grab the fire extinguisher
and bonk those dudes on the head.

716
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:56,438
You want the fire extinguisher?

717
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:09,687
- Enough!
- No, no, it's that one.

718
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:11,252
Fudge!

719
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,000
Cool.

720
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,175
What, are you deaf?

721
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,309
Hey, you don't have to be mean.

722
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,411
How are we gonna get out of here?

723
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,201
Your attention, please.
Our imperial commander, Zoltan...

724
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,372
...requests your presence
in the officentary rec room...

725
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,632
...for a Level 7 meeting. Over.

726
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:26,798
It is now my great pleasure...

727
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:31,936
...to present to you
our wise and powerful leader...

728
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:35,274
...Zoltan.
- Zoltan.

729
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:36,837
Zoltan.

730
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,981
The time has come, you guys.

731
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:01,094
We are finally going to fulfill...

732
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:03,996
...our prophecy of outer space travel.

733
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:05,498
Zoltan.

734
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:08,299
They laughed at us
when we said aliens existed.

735
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,203
They mocked us when we wore
bubble-wrap jumpsuits.

736
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:13,843
But who's laughing now, huh?

737
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:19,485
I'll tell you who's laughing.
We are!

738
00:52:19,753 --> 00:52:20,777
Zoltan.

739
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,251
Soon we will leave this lame planet...

740
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:27,252
...and fly through outer space...

741
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:30,553
...with cool aliens who like us.

742
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:34,528
It is going to be awesome!

743
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:36,029
Zoltan!

744
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,104
That's them! They knocked us out
and stole our space suits!

745
00:52:44,945 --> 00:52:46,913
- No, we didn't.
- Yeah, you did!

746
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,713
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, you did!

747
00:52:48,982 --> 00:52:50,711
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, you did!

748
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:54,385
Hey, who you gonna believe,
us or them?

749
00:52:58,058 --> 00:53:00,822
So you're Jesse and Chester.

750
00:53:02,295 --> 00:53:04,855
I've been looking forward
to meeting you guys...

751
00:53:05,131 --> 00:53:07,258
...although, sorry
it had to be like this.

752
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,793
- Chester!
- Jesse!

753
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,762
- Wanda.
- Wilma!

754
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,433
Normally, we wouldn't
resort to violence...

755
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:17,768
...but we are dealing with
the continuum transfunctioner.

756
00:53:18,745 --> 00:53:22,112
If you don't deliver it to us,
your girlfriends are history.

757
00:53:23,817 --> 00:53:26,149
Don't worry, girls. We'll save you.

758
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,182
Yeah, you can depend on us.

759
00:53:29,556 --> 00:53:30,921
Enough.

760
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:36,092
Go now, and bring us
the continuum transfunctioner.

761
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:40,694
And be quiet on your way out.
My parents are taking a nap.

762
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:52,739
And then tell us where...

763
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:56,005
...the continuum transfunctioner is.
- And then?

764
00:53:56,383 --> 00:53:59,409
- And then we'll be able to go get it.
- And then?

765
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:05,423
Can I get an order
of shrimp fried rice?

766
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:12,854
- I don't see the car.
- It better be in there.

767
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,724
I almost lost my pinky for it.

768
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:20,069
Oh, man, I'm sensing something
very Canadian about this place.

769
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:28,069
Plan B.

770
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:32,879
All right.

771
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,881
Are you ready?

772
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:36,782
Let's do this.

773
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:40,784
One, two, three.

774
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,024
I'm okay. You okay?

775
00:54:50,337 --> 00:54:51,395
Shibby.

776
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,003
Dude, it's a Ilama.

777
00:55:30,343 --> 00:55:33,437
It's not a Ilama. It's an ostrich.

778
00:55:33,713 --> 00:55:36,181
Okay, okay, okay...

779
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:38,644
...very slowly, let's turn around...

780
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:42,416
...and go back the other way.
- Okay.

781
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,452
New plan.

782
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:53,222
We turn around again, very slowly...

783
00:55:53,466 --> 00:55:56,799
...and go back the other way.
- Okay.

784
00:56:03,743 --> 00:56:05,335
They're everywhere.

785
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,415
What now?

786
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:13,713
Hey, I saw this thing
about ostriches on Animal Planet.

787
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:15,818
- They're Ilamas, dude.
- No.

788
00:56:16,423 --> 00:56:20,484
What you're supposed to do
is stand very still...

789
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,820
...and eventually,
they'll get bored and go away.

790
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:30,065
I think it's working.

791
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:40,140
Stupid Ilamas!

792
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:43,875
Chester!

793
00:56:48,254 --> 00:56:49,881
Just get in this car!

794
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:53,286
Go, go!

795
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,087
What do ostriches eat?

796
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,627
- Why?
- Well...

797
00:56:58,932 --> 00:57:00,832
...if they eat peanuts...

798
00:57:01,101 --> 00:57:03,661
...we can just throw a peanut
and they'll go away.

799
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:07,971
- We don't have any peanuts.
- Weak! We're screwed!

800
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:19,384
They're leaving. It worked.

801
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,017
What worked?

802
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:22,811
Whatever we did!

803
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,036
Now may I have
the continuum transfunctioner?

804
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,843
Not quite yet.

805
00:57:46,312 --> 00:57:47,438
Please?

806
00:57:51,317 --> 00:57:52,579
Scary dream, huh?

807
00:57:52,852 --> 00:57:54,979
What's up? My name is Mark.

808
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,516
- Where are we?
- You're in the punishment room.

809
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:02,920
This is where he likes to keep
the ostrich poachers.

810
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:05,627
- Poachers?
- Yeah, that's right.

811
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:09,460
I've been in this cage for three
years, five months, and 17 days...

812
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:11,192
...but who's counting?

813
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:14,237
How's my breath?

814
00:58:17,143 --> 00:58:18,235
That bad, huh?

815
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:22,003
Where you guys from?
I'm from Connecticut. Hi. Mark.

816
00:58:22,348 --> 00:58:23,246
There we go.

817
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:26,250
Chester! Get him off!

818
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:27,914
Pierre!

819
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,615
No, that's not what it looks like.
Maybe a little bit.

820
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,826
- How was your nap?
- Shut up!

821
00:58:35,228 --> 00:58:38,720
Okay. Well, somebody
sure is a Grumpy Gus today.

822
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:45,735
In France, when a man is caught
poaching ostriches...

823
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:50,738
...we shave his head, and we make him
run through the fields.

824
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,602
Oh, God, that's the good part.

825
00:58:52,845 --> 00:58:54,972
Once you have seen this...

826
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,346
...you are never quite the same.

827
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,584
- Okay.
- Tell me about it. I used to model.

828
00:59:03,223 --> 00:59:05,487
Lucky for you, I am an honorable man.

829
00:59:05,992 --> 00:59:07,687
A what? I'm sorry?

830
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:10,356
I said, "I am an honorable man."

831
00:59:10,663 --> 00:59:12,824
I'm sorry, l..."Honorgable"?

832
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:14,657
- Honorable.
- "Honorgable."

833
00:59:14,934 --> 00:59:16,265
- Honorable.
- "Honorgable."

834
00:59:16,502 --> 00:59:18,697
- What are you saying?
- Honorable.

835
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:21,132
I think you're trying
to say honorable.

836
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:24,069
- Shut up!
- Hey! I'm sorry.

837
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:28,102
All right, here it is.
I am going to ask you a question.

838
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:30,882
If you get it right,
I will set you free.

839
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:35,443
If you get it wrong, well,
you will be spending a lot of time...

840
00:59:35,722 --> 00:59:38,190
...with the ever-popular Mark.

841
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,092
I can be very nice.

842
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:43,824
All right. Here it is.

843
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:46,858
What is the average running speed...

844
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:52,095
...of a full-grown male
African ostrich?

845
00:59:52,405 --> 00:59:53,702
Pass.

846
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,600
- Pass to me. I know it.
- Pass to Mark.

847
00:59:56,843 --> 01:00:00,904
You cannot pass! Shut up!
Do I have to hose you down again?

848
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:02,340
Don't hose me!

849
01:00:02,615 --> 01:00:03,639
Maybe later.

850
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,747
- Dude, we're dead.
- Hey, not so fast.

851
01:00:08,154 --> 01:00:11,851
The full-grown male African ostrich
or the Latin struthio camelus...

852
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:15,485
...can grow to an average size
of 6 feet, 6 inches...

853
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:17,389
...and weigh from 225 to 350 pounds...

854
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:21,328
...and can get up to an average speed
of 27 miles per hour.

855
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,525
This is absolutely correct!

856
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,237
Animal Planet.

857
01:00:25,505 --> 01:00:26,995
Well, I said, "Brown."

858
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:30,104
Here, let me get you out
of this stinking cage.

859
01:00:31,077 --> 01:00:34,046
Oh, please forgive me.
Can I get you guys some beers?

860
01:00:34,314 --> 01:00:35,906
I'd like a near beer, please.

861
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:37,080
Shut up!

862
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,783
We just came about the car
you bought today.

863
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,816
We wanted to get some stuff out.

864
01:00:42,088 --> 01:00:44,488
No problem. Right this way.

865
01:00:44,757 --> 01:00:48,557
- It was nice meeting you guys.
- Good luck with the modeling thing.

866
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:51,956
You e-mail me, okay? FreaklnCage. Com.

867
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:01,629
Sacre bleu, the car was here
this afternoon. It... It...

868
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,508
It just disappear!

869
01:01:03,843 --> 01:01:08,337
- How do you just lose a car?
- I'm so sorry, you guys.

870
01:01:08,648 --> 01:01:12,277
- I feel terrible.
- All right, Pierre, just focus here.

871
01:01:12,952 --> 01:01:14,715
Was there anything in the car?

872
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,752
No, nothing.

873
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,389
Except, of course, for this.

874
01:01:23,029 --> 01:01:24,155
Dude!

875
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:42,540
Dude, I'm having my next
birthday party here for sure.

876
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:43,874
Yeah, me too.

877
01:01:48,654 --> 01:01:49,916
Cool.

878
01:01:50,523 --> 01:01:53,048
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where locker 206 is?

879
01:01:53,326 --> 01:01:54,850
Yeah, it's right over there.

880
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:57,254
It's you guys!
Dude, you guys played...

881
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,624
...an amazing round
of putt-putt last night.

882
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,595
- We did?
- Oh, yeah.

883
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,202
- Thanks, dude.
- Shibby.

884
01:02:06,339 --> 01:02:07,533
Here it is.

885
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,239
- I sure hope my money's in there.
- Yep.

886
01:02:11,511 --> 01:02:13,877
- Who are you?
- This is my boyfriend, Patty.

887
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,478
Nice to meet you.

888
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,612
How do you keep popping up?

889
01:02:18,718 --> 01:02:21,812
Less questions,
more giving me my money.

890
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,584
Well, I guess this is it.

891
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,224
Yep. The moment of truth.

892
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:34,555
It's been a long, strange trip, dude.

893
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,734
It sure has, Jesse.

894
01:02:37,537 --> 01:02:39,971
Hey! I've got a plane to catch.

895
01:02:40,273 --> 01:02:42,104
Okay, okay, okay.

896
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:49,714
Oh, my suitcase!

897
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,780
Oh, my God! You guys are the best.

898
01:02:57,323 --> 01:02:59,120
Thank you so much.

899
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:08,193
Thanks for your help, fella.
Good work.

900
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:14,430
Are we supposed to be
grossed out by this, or?

901
01:03:14,674 --> 01:03:16,301
I don't know.

902
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:18,508
Bye.

903
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,377
Look at this stuff.

904
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:25,308
Captain Stu tickets.

905
01:03:25,818 --> 01:03:27,376
Awesome!

906
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:30,521
Oh, jellybeans.

907
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,720
No jellybeans.

908
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,529
Cool straw.

909
01:03:38,364 --> 01:03:40,355
- I'm gonna keep this.
- Yeah.

910
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:55,714
I don't see a
continuum transfunctioner.

911
01:03:56,015 --> 01:03:59,712
Wait a second. What do we know
about the continuum transfunctioner?

912
01:03:59,986 --> 01:04:02,386
It's a very mysterious
and powerful device.

913
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:03,553
And?

914
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:06,757
And its mystery
is only exceeded by its power.

915
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,584
But has anyone ever said
what it looks like?

916
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:12,488
No.

917
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:14,026
They haven't.

918
01:04:25,411 --> 01:04:27,436
That was Jesse and Chester.

919
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,972
They've got
the continuum transfunctioner!

920
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:34,479
Quick! To my mother's minivan!

921
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,517
That was Jesse and Chester.

922
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:44,093
They've got
the continuum transfunctioner.

923
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:48,328
Quick! To my stepdad's pickup truck!

924
01:04:50,937 --> 01:04:53,269
I'm getting the hang
of this thing, dude.

925
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:57,572
Yes!

926
01:04:59,412 --> 01:05:02,745
Oh, yes! I finally beat you!

927
01:05:03,549 --> 01:05:05,449
You. You're a competitor.

928
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:09,921
Oh, boy. You got me the first nine,
but not number 10.

929
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:11,757
Not gonna happen.

930
01:05:13,259 --> 01:05:14,851
- Final showdown time.
- Chester.

931
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,560
- Jesse.
- Don't worry, girls.

932
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:18,963
We're here to save the day.

933
01:05:19,465 --> 01:05:22,559
Quit it. These things are expensive.

934
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:27,529
Enough! Do you have
the continuum transfunctioner or not?

935
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:29,939
Right here.

936
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:33,937
- Now release the girls.
- First give up the transfunctioner.

937
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,114
- First release the girls.
- First give us the transfunctioner.

938
01:05:38,384 --> 01:05:39,681
Same time.

939
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:43,346
Yes!

940
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:49,288
There they are.

941
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:53,026
Okay, stoners, where's
the continuum transfunctioner?

942
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:05,367
Release dodo bird.

943
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,010
- Tommy, you're such a jerk.
- Yeah.

944
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,717
- That's our continuum transfunctioner.
- Well, now it's mine.

945
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:17,382
Nerd.

946
01:06:22,294 --> 01:06:24,922
- Dude, let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

947
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:29,124
Where is the
continuum transfunctioner?

948
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,562
We don't have it.

949
01:06:30,836 --> 01:06:34,636
But we'd like you to meet
our girlfriends, Wanda and Wilma.

950
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:36,099
We've already met.

951
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:40,004
- Stay away from our boyfriends.
- You fake-breasted sluts.

952
01:06:41,814 --> 01:06:44,044
Okay, let's go this way.

953
01:06:46,118 --> 01:06:49,087
Halt. Where is the
continuum transfunctioner?

954
01:06:49,355 --> 01:06:51,619
You want to go talk
to that guy over there.

955
01:06:52,058 --> 01:06:53,548
Let the pleasure begin.

956
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:55,953
That's not the
continuum transfunctioner.

957
01:06:56,562 --> 01:06:57,586
Of course, it is.

958
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:03,200
Follow the kids.
Come on, follow them.

959
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,301
Go, go, go.

960
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,378
Nerd-bashing time.

961
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:23,149
It's not our fault.

962
01:07:23,389 --> 01:07:24,413
It was them.

963
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:27,688
Looking for a Smokey McPot.

964
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,123
I have a delivery
for a Smokey McPot.

965
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,821
- You ordered pizza?
- I figured we'd get hungry.

966
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,294
Oh, no, it's you two!

967
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:38,196
Look, I almost got it.

968
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:42,271
You're really starting to irk me
with your Rubik's Cube fixation!

969
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:43,940
Sweet!

970
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,452
No wonder they're so impossible.

971
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,418
You've activated the
continuum transfunctioner.

972
01:08:01,694 --> 01:08:02,854
What's going on?

973
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,995
Once all five of the
dirugian crystals stop flashing...

974
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:08,096
...the universe will be destroyed.

975
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,494
How do you know?

976
01:08:09,769 --> 01:08:12,101
We intercepted
interstellar transmissions.

977
01:08:12,404 --> 01:08:14,395
- Zoltan.
- Nerds.

978
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,966
Way to go, Chester.

979
01:08:16,308 --> 01:08:17,639
Sorry.

980
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,103
You must give it to us
to deactivate it.

981
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:22,643
We are the keepers
of the transfunctioner.

982
01:08:22,915 --> 01:08:25,076
They will use it
to destroy the universe.

983
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:28,684
No, we are the keepers
of the continuum transfunctioner.

984
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:32,048
- They want to destroy the universe.
- Stop copying us.

985
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:34,282
- Stop copying us.
- Stop copying us.

986
01:08:34,593 --> 01:08:36,288
- Stop copying us.
- Bitch.

987
01:08:36,962 --> 01:08:40,363
Don't you guys remember?
We came to this planet last night...

988
01:08:40,599 --> 01:08:43,227
...to escape the clutches
of those evil space sluts.

989
01:08:43,502 --> 01:08:46,767
- We met you here.
- You gave us a ride to our spaceship.

990
01:08:47,072 --> 01:08:50,166
And we realized we'd lost
the continuum transfunctioner.

991
01:08:51,177 --> 01:08:53,737
Hurry, there's only three
blinking lights left.

992
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:55,311
Bye-bye, universe.

993
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:58,708
He's right, dude.
We're gonna make the wrong decision.

994
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:02,880
You know what, dude? I refuse
to let us go down in history...

995
01:09:03,155 --> 01:09:05,350
...as the dudes
who destroyed the universe.

996
01:09:05,624 --> 01:09:09,082
How do we find out
which ones are the true keepers?

997
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:12,262
It's simple. We ask them
a question about last night...

998
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:15,592
...that only the ones that are
telling the truth would know.

999
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,801
But we can't remember a thing.

1000
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:21,333
- You gotta hurry.
- Not now, Jeff.

1001
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:22,663
Zip it.

1002
01:09:25,644 --> 01:09:28,670
If we really did give one of you guys
a ride last night...

1003
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:30,881
...then you'll know
the answer to this.

1004
01:09:33,519 --> 01:09:34,952
Hurry!

1005
01:09:36,222 --> 01:09:39,214
What score did we get
on the 18th hole...

1006
01:09:39,491 --> 01:09:41,789
...of the miniature golf course
last night?

1007
01:09:48,834 --> 01:09:50,028
You got a hole in one.

1008
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:52,530
That is...

1009
01:09:56,575 --> 01:09:57,473
...correct!

1010
01:10:07,753 --> 01:10:10,153
Deactivation complete.

1011
01:10:19,098 --> 01:10:22,431
Wait. If you guys don't remember
a thing about last night...

1012
01:10:22,668 --> 01:10:25,535
- How do you know they told the truth?
- It's simple.

1013
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:27,203
The pudding!

1014
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:32,772
- You guys had a plan!
- And it actually worked.

1015
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:38,942
For the love of God!

1016
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:44,485
Wow! Morphing is cool!

1017
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:56,031
Whoa! That is one
super hot giant alien!

1018
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,232
Just go!

1019
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,100
- Chester!
- Jesse!

1020
01:11:09,248 --> 01:11:10,613
That is amazing!

1021
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:14,649
Yeah. Those are the biggest
hoo-hoos I have ever seen.

1022
01:11:17,323 --> 01:11:18,813
Do you spit or swallow?

1023
01:11:19,091 --> 01:11:20,149
Swallow!

1024
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:28,859
We will now use the power
of the continuum transfunctioner...

1025
01:11:29,168 --> 01:11:31,227
...to banish you
to Hoboken, New Jersey.

1026
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:40,245
- What are we supposed to do now?
- I think we run, dude!

1027
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:53,053
Boy, those guys are in a hurry.

1028
01:12:02,468 --> 01:12:06,529
- I want to go on that ride, Daddy.
- Me too, son. Me too.

1029
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:25,085
- What do we do with this?
- You've gotta activate...

1030
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:27,621
...the photon accelerator
annihilation beam!

1031
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:31,692
- The what?
- They said, " the photon accelerator...

1032
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:35,195
...annihilation beam," you fool!

1033
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,065
Hurry, activate it, dude!

1034
01:12:42,007 --> 01:12:44,032
- This is it!
- Thanks, Captain Obvious!

1035
01:12:46,211 --> 01:12:47,109
I can't reach it!

1036
01:12:47,413 --> 01:12:49,779
Deep in your consciousness,
you must look!

1037
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:53,214
Concentrate on
the knowledge inside, you must!

1038
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:55,943
Does he have to talk like that?

1039
01:12:56,255 --> 01:12:57,688
I like the way he talks.

1040
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:06,754
Chimpanzees often use sticks
as crude tools.

1041
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,497
I've got it!

1042
01:13:15,174 --> 01:13:16,641
Oh, boy!

1043
01:13:21,947 --> 01:13:23,312
We saved the universe!

1044
01:13:23,582 --> 01:13:25,140
The big bitch is dead!

1045
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:43,624
Damn! Now those are
some big-ass panties.

1046
01:13:44,436 --> 01:13:48,805
- Honey, could you give me a hand?
- No, Tommy. I've found somebody else.

1047
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,504
Jesse and Chester saved us.

1048
01:13:56,748 --> 01:13:59,649
You'll still take us
to outer space with you, right?

1049
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:02,977
There is a party in the Crab Nebula.
You can come too.

1050
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:04,520
Crab Nebula!

1051
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:13,130
- Here you go.
- Thanks for your help.

1052
01:14:13,398 --> 01:14:17,164
- Jesse and Chester.
- You've ensured the universe's safety.

1053
01:14:17,436 --> 01:14:18,801
Well, that's cool and all...

1054
01:14:19,104 --> 01:14:21,334
...but, dude, where's my car?

1055
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,403
You mean you guys don't remember?

1056
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:27,076
- Damn, you were wasted last night.
- Now, we must eliminate...

1057
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:28,937
...knowledge of this encounter.

1058
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:31,706
No. We have so many questions...

1059
01:14:31,984 --> 01:14:34,009
...we want to ask you
about the universe.

1060
01:14:34,486 --> 01:14:37,011
- Like what?
- Well...

1061
01:14:41,193 --> 01:14:43,320
Have you guys
ever been to Uranus?

1062
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:44,994
Nice!

1063
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:02,113
- Morning, guys.
- Morning, Gene.

1064
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:06,245
We'll go to the twins'.

1065
01:15:06,518 --> 01:15:08,816
- And then?
- Then we'll give them their gifts.

1066
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,180
- And then?
- We'll apologize for the house.

1067
01:15:11,456 --> 01:15:13,321
- And then?
- We get our special treats.

1068
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,583
- And then?
- Dude, that's really annoying.

1069
01:15:15,861 --> 01:15:16,987
Sorry.

1070
01:15:17,229 --> 01:15:18,491
Dude, where's my car?

1071
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:22,525
Dude, where's my car?

1072
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:24,902
Where's your car, dude?

1073
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,469
Dude, there's your car.

1074
01:15:35,747 --> 01:15:37,647
"I heart you."

1075
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:41,080
You guys are great boyfriends.

1076
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:46,250
- And we have something for you too.
- A very special treat.

1077
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,649
Shibby!

1078
01:15:49,995 --> 01:15:50,893
Ta-da!

1079
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:53,625
We sewed the names on ourselves.

1080
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:55,698
Wow.

1081
01:15:56,568 --> 01:15:57,466
Put them on.

1082
01:16:04,376 --> 01:16:05,809
You guys look great.

1083
01:16:09,248 --> 01:16:10,772
In berets?

1084
01:16:11,617 --> 01:16:12,675
What are these?

1085
01:16:13,518 --> 01:16:15,349
More gifts.

1086
01:16:17,556 --> 01:16:20,116
- They're beautiful.
- Where did you guys get these?

1087
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:21,724
This...

1088
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:23,425
...place.

1089
01:16:24,363 --> 01:16:25,830
- Wow.
- Me first.

1090
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,224
"Thanks for helping
to save the universe.

1091
01:16:29,468 --> 01:16:31,936
Hope your girls like these gifts.
You will."

1092
01:16:32,371 --> 01:16:35,033
How wasted were we last night?

1093
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,170
- Sweet!
- Dude!

1094
01:16:57,329 --> 01:16:58,853
- Is anyone hungry?
- Yeah.

1095
01:16:59,264 --> 01:17:01,664
- I could go for Chinese food.
- Sounds great.

1096
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:02,865
Sweet!

1097
01:17:08,807 --> 01:17:11,401
- My back itches, dude.
- Jesse, you got a tattoo.

1098
01:17:11,677 --> 01:17:13,304
Oh, my God. So do you, Chester.

1099
01:17:13,612 --> 01:17:15,944
- No way. What's mine say?
- "Dude."

1100
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,841
- What about mine?
- "Sweet."

1101
01:17:18,116 --> 01:17:20,175
- Yeah, but what does mine say?
- "Dude"!

1102
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:21,976
- What about mine?
- "Sweet."

1103
01:17:22,254 --> 01:17:24,950
I know, they're sweet,
but, dude, what's mine say?

1104
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,121
"Dude"!

1105
01:17:26,425 --> 01:17:28,393
- What about mine?
- "Sweet"!

1106
01:17:41,807 --> 01:17:43,399
I can do sexy.

1107
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:46,735
How do you keep popping up like this?

1108
01:17:49,681 --> 01:17:52,275
Come on, this isn't fair.
They're mooning us.

1109
01:17:52,718 --> 01:17:53,878
Sweet, dude.

1110
01:17:54,152 --> 01:17:55,278
It's good, right?

1111
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:00,482
- Sweet!
- Dude!

1112
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,387
- I am fun-Ioving. I like charades.
- Shut up!

1113
01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:05,194
Go ahead and laugh.

1114
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,767
Hold on a second.

1115
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:25,416
Zoltan!

1116
01:18:37,262 --> 01:18:38,024
That's a keeper.

1117
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:39,430
Fingers crossed.

1118
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:43,493
I got it!

1119
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:45,828
You want a piece of this?

1120
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:49,666
- Dude!
- Sweet!

1121
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:52,839
- And then?
- And then we went and...

1122
01:18:53,178 --> 01:18:56,238
- And then?
- Got those sweet jumpsuits so we...

1123
01:18:56,515 --> 01:18:59,382
- And then?
- Then we went and... I'm losing it.

1124
01:18:59,718 --> 01:19:01,913
I am fun-Ioving, without my clothes.

1125
01:19:02,187 --> 01:19:06,146
The platonic...
The gray thing, dummy!

1126
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:07,788
- Dude!
- Sweet!

1127
01:19:14,232 --> 01:19:16,700
Can we cut?

1128
01:19:17,035 --> 01:19:18,593
We gotta cut. We have to.

1129
01:19:19,137 --> 01:19:20,195
You have to cut.

1130
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:21,667
You guys have to cut.

1131
01:19:22,441 --> 01:19:23,465
Cut!

1132
01:19:25,477 --> 01:19:26,671
Punk-ass kids!

1133
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,922
And then?
