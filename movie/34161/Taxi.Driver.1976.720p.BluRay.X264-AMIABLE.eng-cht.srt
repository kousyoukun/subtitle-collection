00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,517
哈利，快去接電話

2
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,715
為什麼你要這麼做？畢克
So what do you wanna hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,399
晚上我睡不著

4
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,349

- There's porno theaters for that.
- I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,678
現在你都做些什麼？
So what do you do now?

6
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,754
現在嗎？晚上我搭車四處跑
地鐵跟公車都坐
Now? Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

7
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,878
我想既然這樣
還不如賺點錢
Figure I might as weII
get paid for it.

8
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,435
你要到上城工作嗎？
南布朗克斯或哈林區？
You wanna work uptown?

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,993
猶太節日你也願意工作嗎？
Will you work Jewish holidays?

11
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,918
隨時隨地都可以
Anytime, anywhere.

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,548
好吧，讓我看看你的職業駕駛執照
Let me see your chauffeur's Iicense.

- 非常清白
How's your record?

14
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,990

你這樣的人給我惹的麻煩夠多了
You gonna break my chops? I got

何不現在就把它拆了？
If you're gonna, you can

17
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,149

我也是海軍陸戰隊
I was in the Marines too.

28
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,477
這到底是怎麼一回事？
So what is it?

29
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,751
你得賺外快？
You need an extra job?

30
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,272
你要兼差？
Are you moonlighting?

31
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,275
我只是想長時間工作
Well, I just wanna work long hours.

32
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,953
兼差是什麼意思？
What's moonlighting?

33
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,277
聽著，填一下表格，明天再回來

Because it's crowded on 57th.

38
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,755

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,310
人行道上的垃圾

off the sidewalks.

43
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,117
現在我可以長時間工作
I'm working long hours now.

44
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,114
下午六點到早上六點

有時候一星期工作七天
Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.

46
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,598
工作時間很長，夠我忙了
It's a long hustle,
but it keeps me real busy.

47
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,035
我一星期能賺300到350塊
I can take in $300,
$350 a week.

48
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
多跑幾趟可以賺更多
Sometimes even more,
when I do it off the meter.

49
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
晚上什麼人都有
All the animals come out at night.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,516
妓女、下三濫、小偷
女王、仙女、毒蟲、毒販
Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.

51
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,713
變態、怪物
Sick, venal.

52
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,272
有時候下一場雨
能讓這些人渣從街頭消失
Someday, a real rain will come and
wash all this scum off the streets.

53
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,276

到布朗克斯、布魯克林、哈林區
I go all over. I take people to
the Bronx, Brooklyn, Harlem.

54
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,438
我不在乎，那對我來說沒差別
I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.

55
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,231
有些人很在乎，他們不肯冒險
It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.

56
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,038
對我來說真的沒有差別
Don't make no difference to me.

57
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,872
司機，請到第48街跟第6街口
48th and 6th, please.

58
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,153
天啊，你真漂亮，漂亮的小女孩
Man, you are gorgeous!
BeautifuI IittIe girI.

59
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,951
我沒空到別的地方去
I can't afford to get stopped.

60
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,310
不，我們不希望發生那種事
We wouldn't want that to happen.

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,231
你可以拿到豐厚小費
你的選擇是正確的
There'II be a big tip for you
if you do the right things.

62
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,392
你真的很厲害
You got a way.

63
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,034
你真的很厲害
You got a way.

64
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,719
對，你說的對
Now you're talking!

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,435
司機，麻煩你開快一點

每晚把車開回車行

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,913
（看到爽）

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,310
（現場演出，限制級電影）

71
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,353
需要我服務嗎？
Can I heIp you?

72
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,591
對，你叫什麼名字？

我叫崔維斯
My name is Travis.

74
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,193
很好聽的名字
有什麼需要我效勞的？
That's nice.
What can I do for you?

75
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,233
我想知道你的名字
你叫什麼名字？
I'd Iike to know what your name is.

76
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,474
饒了我吧
Gimme a break.

77
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,593
聽著，你可以告訴我你的名字
我什麼都不會做
You can tell me what your name is.
I'm not gonna do anything.

78
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,429
- 你要我叫經理過來嗎？
- 你不必叫經理
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to--

79
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,110
- 特洛伊
- 好吧，我是說…
Troy!
AII right. Okay, I mean...

80
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,513
好吧，能給我一包餅乾嗎？

83
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,876
一包巧克力

84
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,831
我還要這個
I'II take these.

85
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,668
可口可樂
Coca-Cola.

86
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,754
我們沒有可口可樂
只有榮冠可樂
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

87
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,116
1塊85
A dollar eighty-five.

88
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,556
工作12個小時，我還是睡不著
Twelve hours of work
and I still can't sleep.

89
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,674
該死
Damn.

90
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,993
日子一天天地過，像是沒有終點
Days go on and on.
And they don't end.

91
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,870
我一直都需要找個地方去
All my life needed was
a sense of someplace to go.

92
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,432
我不相信人該過著自閉的生活
I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.

93
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,990
我相信人就該融入社會
I believe someone should
become a person like other people.

94
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,277
我第一次看到她是在63街
跟百老匯大道的帕蘭汀的競選總部
I first saw her at Palantine campaign
headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.

95
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,233
她穿著白色洋裝
She was wearing a white dress.

96
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,909
看起來像是個天使
She appeared like an angel...

97
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,039
墮入這個塵世
... out of this filthy mass.

98
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,117
她獨自一個人
She is alone.

99
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,833
他們…
They...

100
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,713
無法…
... cannot...

101
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,594
玷污…
... touch...

102
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,668
她
...her.

103
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,229
（玷污她）

104
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,155
（投帕蘭汀一票）

105
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,595
（查爾斯帕蘭汀）

106
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,910
（紐約客支持帕蘭汀當總統）

107
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,078
對，你送了兩箱過來
You delivered two boxes. I think
it's a total of 5000 campaign buttons.

108
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,038
我想一共是五千枚競選胸章

109
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,590
關於之前胸章，我們設定的口號是
Now, all the ones we had before
and our slogan is...

110
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,513
「我們是人民」
「是」劃線做強調
..."We are the people,"
and "are" is underlined.

111
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,194
新胸章劃線強調「我們」
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

112
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,996
念起來變成「我們是人民」
感覺不一樣
That reads, " We are the people."
Well, I think there's a difference.

113
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,153
「我們是人民」
不同於「我們是人民」
"We are the people" is not
the same as " We are the people."

114
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,437
別吵了
Let's not fight.

115
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,355
聽著，我們的結論很簡單
Look, we'II make it reaI simpIe.

116
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,670
我們不付胸章錢
We don't pay for the buttons.

117
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,238
- 我們會把胸章丟掉，好嗎？
- 湯姆，過來一下
- We throw the buttons away, all right?
- Tom, come here a minute.

118
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,159
什麼？
What?

119
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,875
怎麼了？

120
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,431
安迪批准了這份遊說報告後
將備份寄送到各個總部
If Andy okays this canvass report,
send a copy to aII headquarters.

121
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,955
我得影印紐約時報的報導
I gotta xerox that
New York Times articIe.

122
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,714
- 別忘了新聞照片
- 我沒忘記
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't.

123
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,152
我們得強調強制福利
那是要推動的議題
We have to emphasize mandatory welfare.
That's the issue to push.

124
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,277
先推人，再推議題
First push the man, then the issue.

125
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,471
帕蘭汀參議員是個有活力的人
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.

126
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,712
聰明、有趣、清新又迷人
An intelligent, interesting,
fresh, fascinating man.

127
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,114
你忘了性感
You forgot sexy.

128
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,673
我沒忘記性感
I did not forget sexy.

129
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,513
聽聽你的口氣
你一付在賣漱口水的模樣
You sound Iike
you're seIIing mouthwash.

130
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,914
我們是在賣漱口水
We are selling it.

131
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,071
- 我們拿到授權了？
- 非常好笑
- Are we authorized to do that?
- Very funny.

132
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,471
你可以花點力氣想辦法
在競選辦公室賣藥
You can get in trouble
selling pharmaceuticals here.

133
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,200
我叔叔因此坐牢
My uncle's in jail because of that.

134
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,513
那不是真正的監獄
當然跟他太太同住跟坐牢差不多
It's not reaIIy jaiI. Of course,
with his wife, anything wouId be jaiI.

135
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,034
看一下那邊
Look over there.

136
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,474
我愛你
I Iove you.

137
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,835
你有發現任何異狀嗎？
Notice anything?

138
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,235
- 沒有
- 戴上眼鏡
- No.
- Well, put your glasses on.

139
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,034
好吧，等一下，好吧
Okay, just a minute. AII right.

140
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,549
那個計程車司機盯著我們看
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

141
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,109
什麼計程車司機？
What taxi driver?

142
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,430
坐在那邊的計程車司機？
The one that's sitting there.

143
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,036
- 他在那裡多久了？
- 我不知道，但感覺很久了
- How Iong has he been there?
- It feeIs Iike a Iong time.

144
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,069
- 他有騷擾你嗎？
- 不
- Does he bother you?
- No.

145
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,351
你是說有，你的口氣很諷刺
You mean yes.
You're being sarcastic.

146
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,437
你真的很機靈
You're quick.
You're really quick.

147
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,198
我努力機靈一點
I try to be reaI quick.

148
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,670
我會假裝是你的男朋友
I'II pIay the maIe
in this reIationship--

149
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,108
祝你好運
Good Iuck.

150
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,670
請他離開，我不需要祝福，謝謝
-- and tell him to move.
And I don't need good luck.

151
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,639
不，你絕對需要，你只是在逞英雄
Oh yes, you do.
You just think you don't.

152
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,639
你擋到我們的門口了
你可以把計程車移開嗎？
You're blocking our doorway.
You think you might move your cab?

153
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,591
（奧柯特飯店）

154
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,079
眼影，睫毛膏
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

155
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,794
口紅，胭脂
...Iipstick, rouge.

156
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,873
不是胭脂，她們說那是腮紅
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

157
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,475
- 用刷子刷的那一種
- 對，那是腮紅
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah, it's Blush-on.

158
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,315
崔維斯

159
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,349
- 威茲
- 那是腮紅，我太太會用
- Hey, Wiz.
- That's Blush- on. My wife uses it.

160
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,632
問崔維斯吧，他很懂女人
Ask Travis. He's a Iadies' man.

161
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,273
請給我一杯咖啡
A cup of coffee.

162
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,278
總之不論那是什麼東西
她塗了一大堆
Whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a Iot of it.

163
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,869
還有香水，噴在身上的那一種
And then perfume. The spray kind.

164
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,594
聽著，在三區大橋中間
Then in the middle of
the Triboro Bridge--

165
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,031
這個女人美呆了，她在換絲襪
And this woman is beautiful,
she changes her pantyhose.

166
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,508
- 不
- 沒錯
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

167
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,937
- 你做了什麼？
- 我拔掉計費表
What'd you do?
I throw the man out, and I jump
in the back seat and whip it out.

168
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,391
跳到後座，揮舞著它
我說「你知道這是什麼嗎？」
And I said, "You know what this is?"

169
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,394
她說「這是愛」
我跟她共享魚水之歡
She says, " It's love."
I fuck her brains out.

170
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,232
她春情大發，她說
She goes wild and says, "That's the
greatest single experience of my life."

171
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,153
「那是我一生最棒的性經驗」

172
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,916
她給了我兩百塊小費
還有她在阿卡普科的電話號碼
Then she gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

173
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,436
崔維斯，你認識麵團男孩查理嗎？
You know Doughboy, Charlie T.

174
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,834
崔維斯，你有零錢嗎？
Hey, Travis.
Got change for a nickeI?

175
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,429
只要一塊錢
麵團男孩什麼都願意做
Doughboy will do anything for a buck.

176
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,677
怎麼樣？
So how's it hanging?

177
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,313
什麼？
What's that?

178
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,198
我聽了廣播，貝爾車行的司機被殺
I turn on the radio. Some fIeet driver
from BeII just got aII cut up.

179
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,475
是搶劫嗎？
Stickup?

180
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,394
不，他被瘋子殺了
半邊耳朵都被割下來
No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.
Cut half his ear off.

181
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,235
- 在哪裡？
- 122街
Where?
It was on 122nd Street.

182
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,834
該死的瘋狂世界
Fucking Mau Mau Iand.

183
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,120
崔維斯，你是全城跑吧？
You run all over town,
don't you, Travis?

184
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,591
崔維斯

185
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,350
崔維斯

186
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,519
- 你是全城跑吧？
- 對
You run all over town, don't you?

187
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,069
你得應付很難纏的客人吧？
You handle
some pretty rough customers.

188
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,799
沒錯
Yeah, I have.

189
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,278
- 你有帶槍嗎？
- 沒有
You carry a piece?

190
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,556
- 你需要槍嗎？
- 不用
You need one?

191
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,998
我認識一個傢伙能幫你弄到好槍
I know a feIIa who can get you
a reaI nice deaI.

192
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,071
壞人真的很多
Lots of shit around.

193
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,749
我從來不用槍，我很保守
I never use mine. I'm conservative.

194
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,839
但帶著它總是有些威嚇作用
But it's a good thing to have
just as a threat.

195
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,075
我得去八卦一下
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

196
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,959
崔維斯

197
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,708
看吧
Look.

198
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,068
艾洛佛林的浴缸碎片
Piece of ErroI FIynn's bathtub.

199
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,193
看一下圖案
Dig the symbols.

200
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,228
F405434
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

201
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,231
還有浮水印
And the watermark.

202
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,158
一個人
There's one person...

203
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,038
兩個人
...there's two persons...

204
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,753
三個人
...and there's three persons.

205
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,150
我在他住的松林屋拿到的
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

206
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,629
你何不把它拿走？如果你能賣掉它
Take it, and if you can sell it,
you give me half of what you got.

207
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,634
- 分我一半說可以了
- 我不要
I don't want to.

208
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,555
我要去開車樂一下了
I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.

209
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,000
我真的很抱歉
Oh, I'm so terribIy sorry.

210
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,037
- 什麼都沒有
- 那真的很可愛，謝謝
Nothing.
That's very cute. Thank you.

211
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,117
你要看一樣東西嗎？
Hey, you wanna see something?

212
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,878
等一下，我打錯了
「你要看一樣東西嗎？」
Wait, I just typed,
"You wanna see something?"

213
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,878
- 什麼？
- 如果你這隻手
If you had these three fingers
missing on this hand...

214
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,315
少了三根手指

215
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,790
那隻手斷了
...and that hand missing
on that hand...

216
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,673
- 你怎麼點火柴？
- 我就不能點了
- ...how would you light the match?
- I wouldn't.

217
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,031
來吧，試試看
Go ahead. Give it a try.

218
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,996
我想我辦不到
Well, I don't think I could do it.

219
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,508
是嗎？
No?

220
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,398
那一定很難
It's gonna be difficuIt.

221
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,438
我會試試看
I'II give it a try.

222
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,272
我的拇指長回來了，謝天謝地
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

223
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,993
等一下
Just a minute.

224
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,028
我辦不到
I can't do it.

225
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,278
報攤那傢伙可以
The guy at the newsstand can.

226
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,556
我不在報攤工作
Well, I don't work at a newsstand.

227
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,798
- 他可能是意大利人
- 才不是
- Anyway, he's probably ltalian.
- No.

228
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,598
- 你確定？
- 他是黑人
- You're sure?
- He's black.

229
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,110
如果他是意大利人
或許他是小偷，黑道都那樣
If he had been ItaIian,
he might've been a thief.

230
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,949
如果小偷搞砸了
他們會炸斷他的手指
If a thief screws up on the job,
the mob bIows his fingers off.

231
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,709
那聽起來像是玩笑，卻是真的
This sounds Iike a joke,
but it's true.

232
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,117
如果他們殺了密探
會在屍體上放只金絲雀
If they kiII a stooI pigeon,
they Ieave a canary on the body.

233
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,596
- 那是一種象徵
- 為什麼不用鴿子來取代金絲雀？
- It's symboIic.
- Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

234
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,519
我不知道為什麼不用鴿子，等一下
I don't know why not.
Wait a minute.

235
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,599
你得去抓鴿子，如果是金絲雀
你可以走進寵物店
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary,
you can walk into a pet store...

236
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,593
彭，當場殺了它
愛把它放在誰身上都可以
...kill it right there.
Put it on anyone you want.

237
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,956
- 我想當志工
- 太棒了，由我來為你服務
- I'd Iike to voIunteer.
- I'II take you right over here.

238
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,794
如果你不介意，我想當她的志工
I'd rather voIunteer to her,
if you don't mind.

239
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,915
為什麼你要當我的志工？
Why do you have to volunteer to me?

240
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,238
因為你是我見過最美的女人
Because you are the most beautifuI
woman I have ever seen.

241
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,034
謝謝
Thanks.

242
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,510
你對帕蘭汀有什麼看法？
But what do you think of Palantine?

243
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,718
我…

244
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,156
帕蘭汀，你來當志工
幫忙他競選總統
The man you're volunteering
to help elect President.

245
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,597
我相信他會是個好總統
I don't know what his poIicies are,
but I'm sure he'II make a good one.

246
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,196
我不知道他有什麼政策
但我相信他會是個好總統

247
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,274
- 你要加入遊說？
- 對，我要加入遊說
- Do you want to canvass?
- Yeah, I'II canvass.

248
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,074
你對參議員的福利政策立場
有什麼看法？
How do you feeI about
his stand on weIfare?

249
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,717
我不知道他有什麼福利政策立場
但我相信那會是個好立場
I don't reaIIy know his stand on
weIfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand.

250
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,878
- 你確定嗎？
- 對
You're sure of that?

251
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,515
我們得日夜在這裡一起工作
We all work together here,
day and night...

252
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,917
我相信男士們會幫你報名
...so I'm sure the gentIemen
wiII sign you up over there.

253
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,676
問題是晚上我得開計程車
這對我來說有點難
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night,
so it's kind of hard for me...

254
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,036
我沒辦法在白天工作
...to work in the day.

255
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,318
你到底要做什麼？
Then what exactly do you want?

256
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,273
你願意跟我一起喝咖啡吃派嗎？
Would you like to have
coffee and pie with me?

257
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,708
為什麼？
Why?

258
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,155
- 為什麼？我來告訴你為什麼
- 對
Why? I'II teII you why.

259
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,438
我想你是個寂寞的人
I think you're a IoneIy person.

260
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,269
我常開車經過這裡看到你
I drive by a Iot, and I see you here.

261
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,471
我看到你身邊有很多人
I see a Iot of peopIe around you...

262
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,752
看到電話跟你桌上的東西
...and I see these phones
and aII this stuff on your desk...

263
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,319
那一點意義都沒有
...and it means nothing.

264
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,630
我走進來見你
And when I came inside and met you...

265
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,593
看到你的眼神跟你的一舉一動
...I saw in your eyes
and how you carried yourseIf...

266
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,030
你不是個快樂的人
...that you're not a happy person.

267
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,398
我想你需要做一些事情
And I think you need something.

268
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,518
如果你需要朋友
我可以當你的朋友
If you wanna caII it a friend,
you can caII it that.

269
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,789
- 你要當我的朋友？
- 對
You're gonna be my friend?

270
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,193
你覺得如何？
What do you say?

271
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,035
站在這裡等答案有點糗
It's a IittIe hard standing here
and asking you, so...

272
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,995
五分鐘，就那樣
就在外面，就在附近
Five minutes, that's all.
Just outside. Right around here.

273
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,918
我會保護你
I'm there to protect you.

274
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,230
來吧，休息一下
Come on. Just take a IittIe break.

275
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,515
四點時我有空，如果你還在…
I have a break at 4:00.
If you're here--

276
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,751
- 今天四點？
- 對
4:00 today?

277
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,872
- 我會到的
- 我相信一定會的
- I'II be here.
- I'm sure you wiII.

278
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,993
- 好吧，下午四點
- 對
- AII right. Four p.m.
- Right.

279
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,033
- 前門見？
- 對
- Outside in the front?
- Yes.

280
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,468
好的

281
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,108
我是崔維斯，你是貝茜？
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

282
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,911
崔維斯

283
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,670
謝謝你，貝茜
I appreciate this, Betsy.

284
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,635
5月26日，下午4點
May 26th, four o'clock p.m.

285
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,754
我帶貝茜
到哥倫布圓環的查理咖啡廳
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.

286
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,396
我點了黑咖啡跟蘋果派
還有一片融化的黃起司
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.

287
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,830
我想那是不錯的選擇
I think that was a good selection.

288
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,395
貝茜點了咖啡跟水果沙拉
Betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish.

289
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,511
她愛吃什麼都可以
She could've had
anything she wanted.

290
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,439
光在紐約就有一萬五千名志工
那不算太糟糕
15,000 volunteers
in New York alone isn't bad.

291
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,477
卻有組織問題
But the organizationaI probIems!

292
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,597
對，我瞭解你的意思
我有相同的問題
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I got the same probIems.

293
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,908
我得組織一下，一些小事
譬如我的公寓跟私人物品
I gotta get organized. LittIe things,
Iike my apartment, my possessions.

294
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,514
我應該貼張標語
「總有一天我得高潮一下」
I should get a sign: "One of
these days, I'll get organiz-ized."

295
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,392
你是說「組織嗎？」
You mean "organized"?

296
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,471
高潮
Organiz-ized.

297
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,149
高潮，那是玩笑
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

298
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,634
高潮
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

299
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,112
你是說「高潮」
就跟辦公室標語「快閃」一樣
You mean "organiz-ized." Like those
signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

300
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,719
你喜歡你工作的地方嗎？
Do you Iike where you work?

301
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,073
我有很多好同事
我想帕蘭汀當選機會很高
We've got some good people.
Palantine's got a good chance.

302
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,270
你知道你的眼睛很漂亮嗎？
You know you have beautifuI eyes?

303
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,950
你喜歡跟你一起工作的傢伙嗎？
Do you Iike the guy you work with?

304
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,792
他人不錯
He's okay.

305
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,032
對，我知道，但你喜歡他嗎？
But do you Iike him?

306
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,997
他很風趣，工作能力不錯
他還不錯，雖然他有問題
He's funny and very good at his job.
Though he does have a few problems.

307
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,395
我就知道他有些問題
I'd say he has quite a few probIems.

308
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,157
他的體力用錯了地方
His energy seems to go
in the wrong places.

309
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,598
我走進去時看到你們坐在一起
When I waIked in and I saw
you two sitting there...

310
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,678
我看得出來你們沒有火花
...I couId just teII
that there was no connection...

311
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,279
沒有任何關係
...whatsoever.

312
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,717
一走進去，我覺得我們之間有感覺
And when I waIked in,
there was something between us.

313
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,639
我們都是衝動型的人
There was an impulse
we were both following.

314
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,559
所以我該跟你說話
So that gave me the right
to talk to you.

315
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,509
不然我會覺得我不該跟你說話
Otherwise, I never wouId've
had the right to taIk to you.

316
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,758
我會沒有勇氣跟你說話
I never wouId've had
the courage to taIk to you.

317
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,114
他沒有給我那樣的感覺
And with him,
I feIt there was nothing.

318
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,392
一走進去，我知道我是對的
你也是那麼想的嗎？
When I waIked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feeI that way?

319
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,275
要不是我那麼想
我也不會坐在這裡
I wouIdn't be here if I didn't.

320
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,868
你是哪裡人？
Where are you from?

321
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,595
紐約州北部
Upstate.

322
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,318
我不喜歡那個傢伙
That fellow, I don't like him.

323
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,512
不是那種不喜歡
我只是覺得他很蠢
Not that I don't Iike him,
I just think he's siIIy.

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,230
我想他不尊敬你
I don't think he respects you.

325
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,477
我想我沒見過像你這樣的人
I don't beIieve I've ever met
anyone quite Iike you.

326
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,558
你要跟我
You wanna go to...

327
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,552
去看電影嗎？
...a movie with me?

328
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,039
- 我得回去上班
- 我不是說現在，下次？
- I have to go back to work now.
- I don't mean now. Another time?

329
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,994
沒問題
你知道你讓我想起什麼嗎？
Sure. You know what you remind me of?

330
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,354
- 什麼？
- 那首歌
What?
That song...

331
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,598
克裡斯克裡斯多佛森的歌
...by Kris Kristofferson.

332
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,198
- 他是誰？
- 詞曲創作人
Who's that?
The songwriter.

333
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,958
「他是先知」
" He's a prophet...

334
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,918
「他是先知跟鼓動者」
He's a prophet and a pusher...

335
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,159
「半真半假，充滿矛盾」
...partly truth, partly fiction,
a walking contradiction."

336
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,239
你是在說我嗎？
You saying that about me?

337
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,152
不然我會說誰呢？
Who else would I be talking about?

338
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,478
我不是鼓動者，我從來不鼓動別人
I'm no pusher.
I've never pushed.

339
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,388
不，我是指矛盾的那個部份
Just the part about the contradictions.

340
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,437
你給人那種感覺
You are that.

341
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,828
我又打電話到辦公室找貝茜
她說明天下班後
I called Betsy again. She said
maybe we'd go to a movie...

342
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,952
或許我們可以去看電影
那天我休假
...after work tomorrow.
That's my day off.

343
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,352
剛開始她有些猶豫
但我又打電話給她，她答應了
At first she hesitated,
but I called her again and she agreed.

344
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,512
貝茜，不
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.

345
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,433
貝茜姓什麼？我忘了問她的姓氏
Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name.

346
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,916
該死，我得記住那樣的事
Damn! I gotta remember
stuff like that.

347
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,799
別擔心自己跑來的人
Don't worry about anyone
committing themselves...

348
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,673
除非加州那邊開始有動作
...untiI things come in
from CaIifornia.

349
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,798
聽著，我想我們該等禮車
Listen, I think we shouId've
waited for the Iimo.

350
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,792
我不介意搭計程車，但我介意
I don't mind the cab,
but I mind...

351
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,794
不做好準備就跑到加州
那會害我們惹上麻煩
...going to California
without the right preparation.

352
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,030
你是候選人查爾斯帕蘭汀嗎？
Are you Charles Palantine,
the candidate?

353
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,671
我就是
Yes, I am.

354
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,319
我是你的支持者
I teII everybody that comes in this taxi
that they have to vote for you.

355
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,950
我告訴所有搭車的人都得投你一票

356
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,753
謝謝你
Why, thank you...

357
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,669
（崔維斯畢克）

358
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,875
崔維斯
...Travis.

359
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,038
我相信你一定會當選
我認識的人都要投你一票
I'm sure you'II win.
Everybody I know wiII vote for you.

360
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,629
我要把你的貼紙貼在我車上
I was gonna put your sticker
in my taxi...

361
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,798
但車行說那違反公司政策
...but the company said
it was against their policy.

362
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,592
他們是一群混蛋
They're a bunch of jerks.

363
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,673
我得說搭計程車比坐禮車趴趴走
Let me tell you, I have learned
more about America...

364
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,077
讓我更能夠瞭解民情
...from riding in cabs than in all
the limos in the U.S.

365
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,793
- 是嗎？
－一點都沒錯
- Oh, yeah?
- That's true.

366
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,840
- 我能問你一件事嗎？崔維斯
- 當然可以
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

367
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,191
這個國家讓你最困擾的事是什麼？
What bugs you the most
about this country?

368
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,710
我不知道，我不是很關心政治議題
Well, I don't know. I don't follow
political issues that closely, sir.

369
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,430
一定有事讓你困擾
Well, there must be something.

370
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,793
不論如何，他該整頓這個城市
Well, whatever it is, he should
clean up this city here...

371
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,511
因為這個城市像開放式下水道
到處是垃圾跟人渣
...because it's Iike an open sewer.
It's fuII of fiIth and scum.

372
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,831
有時候我覺得快要受不了
Sometimes I can hardIy take it.

373
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,038
當選總統的人應該
Whatever becomes the President
should just...

374
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,796
好好加以整頓
你瞭解我的意思嗎？
...really clean it up. You know?

375
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,669
有時一出門我會聞到臭味
我會頭痛，真的很臭
Sometimes I go out and I smeII it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

376
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,952
它們像是…臭味永遠不會消失
你懂嗎？
And they just never go away, you know?

377
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,555
我想總統應該
I think that the President
shouId just...

378
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,556
好好處理這個問題
把所有垃圾衝進馬桶裡
...clean up this mess. He should
flush it right down the fucking toilet.

379
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,198
我想我瞭解你的意思，崔維斯
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

380
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,431
要那麼做並不容易
But it's not gonna be easy.

381
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,110
- 我們得採取激烈改變
－一點都沒錯
- We'II have to make radicaI changes.
- Damn straight.

382
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,517
拿去吧，崔維斯，不用找了
Here you go.
Keep the change.

383
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,039
謝謝
Thank you.

384
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,556
- 很高興能跟你聊天
- 我也是
- Nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

385
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,149
你是個好人，我知道你會當選的
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.

386
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,351
謝謝你，小心開車
Thank you, I think.

387
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,480
來吧，送我離開這裡，好嗎？
Just get me outta here,
all right?

388
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,672
快點
Come on!

389
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,198
來吧，寶貝，這真的很遜
Come on, baby.
This is a reaI drag.

390
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,034
來吧，別把事情鬧大
Now, come on!
Don't make a scene.

391
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,119
你想被抓嗎？
You wanna get busted?

392
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,639
臭女孩，冷靜點
Bitch, be cooI!

393
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,596
別惹麻煩
Don't start no trouble.

394
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,756
司機，忘了這一切，沒事的
Cabbie, just forget about this.

395
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,228
冷靜點，臭女孩
Be cool, bitch!

396
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,471
- 停車
- 你要聽我說嗎？

397
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,031
怎麼了？寶貝

398
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,391
給我滾開
Get your ass out of here!

399
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,834
- 你好
- 嗨
Hi there.

400
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,359
- 今天還好嗎？
- 沒什麼特別的
- Have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.

401
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,232
我幫你準備了禮物
Got a present for you.

402
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,155
等一下是克魯帕的切分風格
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

403
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,508
為什麼你要那麼做？
Why'd you do that?

404
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,672
不然我的錢要花在什麼地方？
What else am I gonna do
with my money?

405
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,156
我希望你能聽一下
I wish you'd have Iistened to this.

406
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,752
我也想聽，但我的唱機不能用
I wouId have, except my record
pIayer doesn't work now.

407
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,194
你的音響壞了？
Your stereo's broken?

408
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,869
你怎麼受得了？沒音樂我活不下去
How do you stand it?
I can't Iive without music.

409
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,749
我不常聽音樂，但我很喜歡音樂
I don't foIIow music too much,
but I wouId reaIIy Iike to.

410
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,877
你還沒聽過這張唱片？
Then you haven't played
this record yet.

411
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,553
沒錯

412
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,075
我想我們可以用你的唱機
一起聽一下
But I was thinking maybe we couId
Iisten to it on your record pIayer.

413
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,995
現在是有四十年經驗的契克韋布
Now, going back through
40 years of Chick Webb.

414
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,993
（兩部超棒的熱門成人電影
大膽的超限制級娛樂）

415
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,912
（甜美蘇珊）

416
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,758
你一定是在開玩笑
You gotta be kidding.

417
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,236
- 什麼？
- 這是色情片
What?
This is a dirty movie.

418
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,674
不，很多情侶會一起來看這部電影
No, no. This is a movie
that a Iot of coupIes come to.

419
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,793
- 各種情侶都會來這裡
- 你確定？
- AII kinds of coupIes go here.
- You sure about that?

420
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,715
對，我常看到他們
Yeah, I see them aII the time.

421
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,109
來吧
Come on.

422
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,430
我爸媽非常嚴格

423
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,913
陰莖

424
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,069
精子

425
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,117
卵子

426
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,712
主人跟強森到美國唸書前

427
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,036
瑞典的研究打下基礎

428
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,319
閉嘴

429
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,755
- 你要去哪裡？
- 我得離開
- Where are you going?
- I have to Ieave.

430
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,270
- 為什麼？
- 我不知道為什麼我會到這裡
- Why?
- I don't know why I came in here.

431
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,795
- 我不喜歡這些電影
- 我是說…
- I don't Iike these movies.
- WeII, I mean--

432
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,918
我不知道你對這部電影
會有那樣的感覺
I didn't know you'd feeI
that way about this movie.

433
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,038
- 早知道的話…
- 你只會看這些電影？
- If I had--
- Are these the onIy movies you go to?

434
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,238
對，我說我會來…
這裡還不錯
Yeah, I mean I come and--
This is not so bad.

435
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,279
帶我來這種地方
像是在鼓勵我說「跟我上床吧」
Taking me here is as exciting
to me as saying, " Let's fuck."

436
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
我可以帶你到別的地方
There are other movies
I can take you to.

437
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,631
我不是很懂
但我可以帶你到別的地方
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you other pIaces.

438
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,638
我們是不一樣的人
We're just different.

439
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,430
- 等一下
- 我得走了
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

440
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,834
- 我得走了
- 等一下
I've got to go now.

441
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,675
- 等一下，我要跟你談
- 聽著，我得走了
- Wait a second, I want to taIk.
- But I have to go.

442
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,389
計程車
Taxi!

443
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,758
至少我能跟你談一下嗎？
你不能跟我談嗎？我不知道你…
Can I taIk to you at Ieast?
Won't you at Ieast to taIk to me?

444
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,313
為什麼你不收下唱片？
Take the record.

445
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,875
- 我已經有了
- 拜託
- I've aIready got it.
- But, pIease.

446
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,079
- 我為你買的，貝茜
- 現在我有兩張了，走吧
- I bought it for you, Betsy.
- Okay, now I've got two. Let's go.

447
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,998
我能打電話給你嗎？
Can I caII you?

448
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,316
天啊，計程車我就有了
Jesus Christ, I got a taxi.

449
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,798
貝茜
Hello, Betsy.

450
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,718
我是崔維斯
Hi, it's Travis.

451
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,558
你好嗎？聽著，那晚的事我很抱歉
Listen, I'm sorry
about the other night.

452
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,837
我不知道你會那麼想
I didn't know that was
the way you feIt about it.

453
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,714
我不知道
不然我會帶你去別的地方
Well, I didn't know. If I--
I'd have taken you somewhere else.

454
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,070
你好一點了嗎？
Are you feeling better or...?

455
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,629
或許你被病毒感染
24小時病毒，你知道的
Maybe you had a virus or something.
A 24-hour virus, you know.

456
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,150
的確會發生那種事
It can happen. Yeah.

457
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,434
你一直都忙著工作？對
You've been working hard, huh?

458
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,796
你要跟我吃晚餐嗎？
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

459
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,679
就這幾天？
...in the next few days or something?

460
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,318
要不要喝杯咖啡？
How about a cup of coffee?

461
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,633
我可以去總部，我們可以…
I couId come by the headquarters
or something, and we couId...

462
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,351
好吧
Okay, okay.

463
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,554
你有收到我的花嗎？
Did you get my flowers and the...?

464
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,837
你沒收到花？我送了花過去
You didn't get them?
But I sent some fIowers.

465
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,114
對，好吧

466
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,350
我能再打電話給你嗎？
Can I caII you again?

467
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,314
明天或後天？好吧
Tomorrow or the next day?

468
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,432
不，我要…好吧，當然
No, I'm gonna--
Okay, yeah, sure.

469
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,073
再見
So Iong.

470
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,357
我試著打過幾次電話給她
I tried several times to call her...

471
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,433
自從第一通電話後
她再也不肯接我電話
...but after the first call,
she wouldn't come to the phone.

472
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,269
我還送花過去，她沒有反應
I also sent flowers,
but with no luck.

473
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,114
花香讓我病得更重
The smell of the flowers
made me sicker.

474
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,876
頭痛更厲害，我想我得了胃癌
The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.

475
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,550
我不該抱怨
I shouldn't complain, though.

476
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,071
想保持健康…
You're only as healthy...

477
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,394
想保持健康就得快樂
You're only as healthy as you feel.

478
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,113
想保持…
You're only...

479
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,032
健康
...as healthy...

480
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,679
就…
...as...

481
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,478
得…
...you...

482
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,039
快樂
... feel.

483
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,989
- 別惹事，好嗎？
- 為什麼你不跟我說話？
- Let's not have trouble.
- Why won't you talk to me?

484
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,674
你以為我不知道你在這裡？
You think I don't know you're here?

485
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,911
你以為我不知道嗎？
You think I don't know?

486
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,798
- 請你離開
- 把你的手拿開
- Please leave.
- Take your hands off!

487
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,190
我只是要你知道…
I just want you to know--

488
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,868
請你離開，這裡不適合這麼做
Please.
This is no place to do this.

489
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,155
把你的手拿開

490
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,038
- 把你的手拿開
- 請你離開
- Take your hands off!
- Just Ieave.

491
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,352
- 好吧，請你離開
- 我要跟你說
- AII right, Ieave, then!
- I wanna teII you...

492
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,200
你會墮入地獄
你會跟其他人一樣死後墮入地獄
...you're in hell!
And you'll die in hell.

493
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,153
- 來吧，那邊有警察
- 你跟其他人一樣
- There's a cop over there.
- You're Iike the rest of them.

494
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,709
聽著，我要報警了，警官
Look, I'm caIIing the cop.
Officer!

495
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,079
警官
Officer!

496
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,030
聽著，別到這裡來，我會報警的
Don't come around here,
because I'II caII the poIice!

497
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,954
現在我知道她跟其他人有多像
冷漠又疏離
I realize now, how much she's just
like the others, cold and distant.

498
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,838
許多人都是那個樣子
Many people are like that.

499
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,356
特別是女人，她們都一樣
Women for sure.
They're like a union.

500
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,119
計程車
Yo, cabbie!

501
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,799
好吧，停在那邊
路邊停就可以，那邊
Pull over to the curb over there.
Right over there.

502
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,870
不，不要…
No, don't.

503
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,474
該死的計費表，你在做什麼？
The fucking meter.
What are you doing?

504
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,837
你對計費表做了什麼？
What are you doing with the meter?

505
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,191
我有叫你…
我有叫你對計費表那麼做嗎？
Did I teII you to do that
with the meter?

506
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,476
把計費表裝回去，繼續計費
Put the meter back.
I don't care what I have to pay.

507
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,358
我不在乎必須付多少錢

508
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,189
我不下車，把計費表打開
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

509
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,395
把它裝好
Put it down.

510
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,751
沒錯，把它裝好
That's right.
Put it down!

511
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,919
沒錯
That's right.

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,274
為什麼你要寫字？別寫字
Why are you writing?
Don't write!

把它裝上去，坐好
Put the thing down.
Just sit.

514
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,552
我沒要你寫東西
我跟你說「停車」
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, " Pull over."

515
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,269
我們在路邊停車，我們得坐在這裡
Pull over to the curb and sit here.

516
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,877

00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,553
司機，你看到那盞燈了嗎？
那扇窗戶？
Cabbie, you see that Iight up there?
In the window?

519
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,395

The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

521
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,590
亮著燈的窗戶，就在二樓
The Iight up in the window.

你怎麼了？你瞎了嗎？
What are you, blind?

你看到燈了嗎？

你看到窗裡的那個女人了嗎？
Do you see the woman in the window?

527
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,357
- 對
- 你看到那個女人了，很好
Yeah.

528
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,432
我要你看那個女人
因為她是我太太
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

529
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,797
但那不是我的公寓
But that's not my apartment.

530
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,438
那不是我的公寓
你知道誰住在那裡嗎？
It's not my apartment.
You know who Iives there?

531
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,035

你知道誰住在那裡嗎？
No, you wouldn't know.
But you know who lives there?

532
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,952
一個黑鬼住在那裡
A nigger Iives there.

533
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,037
你會想怎麼做？
How do you Iike that?

我要殺了她

沒有別的辦法，我要殺了她
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.

536
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,511
你有什麼想法？
What do you think of that?

537
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,475
我說你有什麼想法？
I said, "What do you think of that?"

538
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,399
別回答
Don't answer.

你不必回答我
You don't have to answer everything.

能對女人的臉造成多大殺傷力嗎？
Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum
can do to a woman's face?

543
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,679
我是說它能打爛她的臉
把她的臉轟爛
It'd fucking destroy it.
Just bIow it right apart.

544
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,150
那把槍可以轟爛她的臉
That's what it can do to a face.

545
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,637
你知道它對女人的私處

（貝爾摩餐館）

555
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,396
我載了這個侏儒
I picked up this midget, you know.

556
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,154
他打扮得人模人樣
穿著意大利制西裝
He's very well-dressed,
ltalian suit...

557
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,789

帶著一位高佻的金髮美女
...good-Iooking,

558
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,548

那些侏儒很有趣

有時我想抱抱侏儒

他們很有趣，老想坐在前座
They always want to sit

他們要去市區
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

他們穿著萊茵石T恤
他們開始大叫吵架
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts.
They start arguing and yelling.

另一個人說「你這個賤人」
他開始打他
The other one says, "You bitch,"
and starts beating him.

566

「美國是個自由的國家」
This is a free country.

- 「上帝愛你們，隨你們開心」
- 叫他們去加州吧
- Do what you want.
- Tell them to go to California.

572
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,836
在加州同志分手還得付贍養費
In CaIifornia, when two fags spIit up,
one's got to pay the other aIimony.

573
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,035
那還不錯，那裡很進步
你知道嗎？我是說加州
Not bad. They're way ahead
out there, you know? California.

要不是在肯尼迪機場載了
來自俄亥俄州的傢伙，我就破產了
I be broke if I hadn't caught me
some peopIe from Ohio out at Kennedy.

I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach, tipped me $5.

How's the action around?

蠻冷清的
It's very sIow.

584

我要閃了
I'm shoving on.

585
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,313
威斯，等一下
Hey, Wiz, wait.

586
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,590
- 我能跟你談一談嗎？
- 再見，殺手
- Can I taIk to you for a second?
- Bye, KiIIer.

587

別打我的男人
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

你最好快滾，孩子
You better take your ass out, boy!

I know you and I ain't taIked
too much, you know.

592
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,634
我知道你跟我不常說話

593
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,712
但我知道你很有見識
或許你可以…
But you've been around, so...

594
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,434
該死，那是大家叫我巫師的原因
Shoot, that's why
they call me the Wizard.

595
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,914
我有…

你有心事？
Things got you down?

598
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,348
對，即使是高手都會有低潮
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,079
對，我真的很煩
Yeah, they got me reaI down.
ReaI...

600

601
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,512
做一些事
...and you know, really,
really do something.

602
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,471
計程車人生，你知道嗎？
Taxi Iife, you mean?

603
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,035
對

604
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,117
不，那是…
No, it's...

605
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,634
我不知道
I don't know.

606

我只想站出來
I just want to go out...

607
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,670
我真的…

608

我真的想要…
I reaIIy want to...

609
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,558
我有一些不好的念頭，我只是…

610
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,795
聽著，就這麼說吧
Look at it this way.

611
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,959
男人需要工作
A man takes a job.

612
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,078
工作…
And that job...

613
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,589
成了他的價值
...you know, that becomes what he is.

614
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,717
你知道的，就像是…
You know, Iike...

615
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,874
你做了一件事，它成了你的代表
You do a thing,
and that's what you are.

我開了17年計程車
10年時間在開夜班
I've been a cabbie for 17 years.
Ten years at night.

617
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,993
我還是沒有自己的計程車
為什麼？
And I stiII don't own my own cab.
You know why?

618
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,952
因為我不想那麼做
必須我想那麼做才行
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

619
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,357
上夜班，開別人的計程車
To be on the night shift,
driving somebody else's cab.

620
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,232
你懂嗎？
You understand?

621
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,238
你有了工作，成為工作的一部份
You get a job, you become the job.

622
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,989
有人住布魯克林，有人住蘇頓飯店
One guy Iives in BrookIyn,
one guy Iives in Sutton PIace.

623

有人死了，有人活得很好
Another guy dies,
another guy gets well...

626
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,356
我羨慕你，你的年輕
I envy you, your youth.

627
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,995
你能出去泡妞，喝得爛醉
你愛做什麼都可以
Go out and get Iaid.
Get drunk. Do anything.

628
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,632
你沒有選擇，我們都完了
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're aII fucked.

629
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,550
多多少少都是的，你知道嗎？
More or Iess, you know?

630
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,473
我不知道，那是我聽過最蠢的事
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard of.

631
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,311
那不是羅素的名言
你想怎麼樣？我只是個計程車司機
It's not Bertrand RusseII,
but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

632
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,754
我又知道什麼？

633
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,833
我甚至聽不懂你在說什麼
I don't even know what
you're taIking about.

634
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,355
或許我也不知道
Maybe I don't know either.

635
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,236
別那麼憂心忡忡的，放輕鬆
殺手，你會沒事的
Don't worry so much. Relax, kid,
you're gonna be all right.

636
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,358
我知道的，我見過很多人
I know.
I've seen a Iot of peopIe...

637
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,758
- 我知道
- 好吧
...and I know.

638
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,319
好吧，謝謝你
Okay. Thanks, man.

639
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,870
再見，我想是的

640
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,277
對，你知道的，你一定會沒事
Yeah, you know.
You're all right.

641
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,757
你覺得在即將到來的初選中
你的對手機會有多大？
What do you think of your opponent's
chances in the upcoming primary?

642
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,558
古德曼先生是個好人
Mr. Goodman is a fine man.

643
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,110
我真的很希望
如果可以的話，他會是
I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...

644
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,908
敵對陣營的候選人
... to our opponent
in the other party.

645
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,749
我想我的政策比他好
I think that my programs
are better defined than his.

646
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,675
他們的政策都是想像
我的勝選機率比較大
They're more imaginative.
I have a better chance of winning.

647
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,718
這都只是猜想
他無法贏得初選，我會贏的
It's academic, though.
He's not going to win. I am.

648
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,678
我懂了
I see.

649
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,273
我還要問你一件事
Well, one more thing
I'd like to ask you.

650
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,715
你對自己的競選活動有什麼想法？
How do you feel
your campaign is going?

651
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,111
我們想出口號「我們是人民」
When we came up with our slogan
"We are the people"...

652
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,590
我說「讓人民統治國家」
... when I said
"Let the people rule"...

653
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,674
我覺得我有點過度樂觀
...I felt I was being
overly optimistic.

654
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,469
我得說現在我比以前樂觀
I must tell you that I am more
optimistic now than ever before.

655
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,599
人們接受我對他們的要求
The people are rising to the demands
that I have made on them.

656
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,274
人們開始統治國家
The people are beginning to rule.

657
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,119
我覺得這是股風潮，我知道
I feel it is a groundswell.
I know...

658
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,278
它會蔓延到初選跟邁阿密
... it will continue
through the primary and in Miami.

659
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,238
我知道它會在十一月
And I know it will rise...

660
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,159
掀起前所未見的巨濤
... to an unprecedented swell
in November.

661
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,719
（還有四天
查爾斯帕蘭汀即將亮相）

662
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,995
（休息）

663
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,670
那個臭女人，該死
我要轟掉她的腦袋
That bitch!
I'II bIow her brains out!

664
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,032
我要殺了她，我會親手殺了她
I'II kiII her, goddamn it!
I'm gonna get my hands and kiII her!

665
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,554
該死，混蛋
Shoot, goddamn it!

666
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,474
我發誓被我逮到
我一定要殺了她

667
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,753
- 帥哥
- 帥哥
Hey, Sport.

668
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,150
我要殺了她，該死

669
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,392
- 那傢伙一直在跟蹤我們
- 別看她
- That guy keeps following us.
- Don't look at him.

670
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,119
大家好
Hey, guys.

671
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,633
- 你們要去散步嗎？
- 對
Wanna take a walk?

672
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,315
在我的一生中
寂寞對我是如影隨形
Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.

673
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,114
不論是在酒吧、車上
In bars, in cars...

674
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,994
人行道、商店，緊追不捨
...sidewalks, stores, everywhere.

675
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,519
我無處可逃
There's no escape.

676
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,434
我是個寂寞的人兒
I'm God's lonely man.

我的人生又面臨轉折點
My life has taken another turn again.

679
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,750
一成不變地度過每一天
The days move along
with regularity, over and over...

680
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,520
每天都一樣

from the next.

681
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,228
掙脫不了的鎖鏈
A long, continuous chain.

682
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,271
突然間
And then suddenly...

683
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,556

687
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,070
沒關係，我有錢
It's aII right. I got money.

688
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,998
這是非常強大的武器

I couId seII this gun to some
jungIe bunny in HarIem for $500.

695
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,116
但我只把高級品賣給適合它的人
But I just deaI high-quaIity goods

696
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,594
怎麼樣？
How about that?

697
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,994
對實用性來說，這有點太大了

for practicaI purposes.

698
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,436

你在等參議員？

Don't you have some idea?

892
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,672
我不想談
I'm not the one who
wants to talk.

893
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,913
但你知道我沒嫁給他
You must know that the reason
that I didn't marry him...

894
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,999
因為我不要成為他離婚的理由
... is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.

895
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:51,116
現在他要離婚
Now he's getting a divorce anyway.

896
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,314
菲利普想跟我結婚，布洛克
Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.

897
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,670
我的確愛他
I do love him.

898
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,352
我們怎麼辦？瓊安
What about us, June?

899
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,678
我們的婚姻呢？
Our marriage?

900
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,471
你得知道我們的婚姻並不合法
You know our marriage wasn't legal.

901
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,837
在上帝眼中，我們是夫妻
In the eyes of God, we are married.

902
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,318
布洛克，請別逼我這麼做
Brock, please don't do this to me.

903
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,835
我非常愛他
I love him--

904
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,678
該死
Damn.

905
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,231
天殺的
God damn!

906
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,756
他們擠過來拍照

907
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,594
- 你要樂一下嗎？
- 對
- Are you Iooking for some action?
- Yeah.

908
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,230
- 看到那個傢伙了嗎？
- 對
See that guy over there?

909
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,550
過去跟他談，他叫麥修
Go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

910
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,270
- 我到那邊等你
- 好的
I'II be over there waiting for you.

911
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,190
你叫麥修？我要樂一下
Your name Matthew?
I want some action.

912
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,119
警官
Officer.

913
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,274
我發誓我是清白的
我只是在這裡等朋友
I swear I'm cIean. I'm just
waiting here for a friend.

914
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,790
你要平白無故逮捕我？
You're gonna bust me for
nothing, man?

915
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,395
我不是警察
I'm not a cop. I ain't a--

916
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,795
為什麼你要那樣子跟我說嗎？
Then why are you asking me for action?

917
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,391
她叫我來找你
Because she sent me over.

918
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,438
我想你襪子裡沒插著點38手槍
I suppose that ain't a .38
you got in your sock.

919
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,278
點38手槍？
.38?

920
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,719
我沒帶槍
I'm cIean, man.

921
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,639
- 該死，你真的是牛仔？
- 對
Shit, you're a reaI cowboy?

922
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,310
太棒了，好吧
That's nice, man. AII right.
That's aII right.

923
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,275
15塊是15分鐘
半小時算你25塊
15 dollars, 15 minutes.
25 dollars, half an hour.

924
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,433
該死
Shit.

925
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,028
牛仔？
Cowboy, huh?

926
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,989
我曾養過一匹馬，在科尼島
I once had a horse.
On Coney IsIand.

927
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,912
它被車撞了
She got hit by a car.

928
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,311
要不要隨便你
Well, take it or leave it.

929
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,637
如果你想省點錢，別跟她做
If you wanna save yourseIf
some money, don't fuck her.

930
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,631
因為你還會想回來
She'II be back for more.

931
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,679
她才12歲半
你一定沒試過那樣的女孩
She's 12 years old. You ain't
never had no pussy like that.

932
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,596
愛做什麼都可以，爬到她身上
Do anything you want.
Come on her...

933
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,678
插在她的嘴裡跟屁眼裡
射滿她一臉
...fuck her in the mouth, in the ass.
Come on her face.

934
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,270
她會讓你的小弟弟變硬，讓你爆炸
She'II get your cock so hard,
she'II make it expIode.

935
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,716
別來硬的，好吧？
But no rough stuff. AII right?

936
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,357
好吧，我要她
AII right, I'II take it.

937
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,195
兄弟，別在這裡付錢
Hey, man! Don't take out no money
over here.

938
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,628
你要上我嗎？
You gonna fuck me?

939
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,872
你要上她，把錢交給她
You're gonna fuck her.
You give her the money.

940
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,873
待會見，條子
Catch you Iater, copper.

941
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,395
- 你說什麼？
- 待會見，條子
What'd you say?
See you Iater, copper.

942
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,874
我不是警察
I'm no cop, man.

943
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,517
如果你是警察，這一定是圈套
Well, if you are,
it's entrapment already.

944
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,869
我是嬉皮
I'm hip.

945
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,235
真有趣，你看起來不像嬉皮
Funny, you don't Iook hip.

946
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,714
去吧，讓自己樂一下，快點
Have yourself a good time.
Go ahead, man.

947
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,556
你是個有趣的傢伙
You're a funny guy.

948
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,750
別被表面騙了
But Iooks aren't everything.

949
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,077
去吧，好好玩一場
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

950
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,276
你是個有趣的傢伙

951
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,992
嘿

952
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,430
房間是10塊錢
The room'II cost you ten bucks.

953
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,317
我會幫你計時
I'm timing you too.

954
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,918
來吧
Come on.

955
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,112
你真的是12歲半？
Are you really twelve?

956
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,239
聽著，先生，時間是你的
15分鐘不久
Listen, mister, it's your time.
15 minutes ain't Iong.

957
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,678
香煙燒完後，你的時間也到了
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

958
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,318
你幾歲？
How old are you?

959
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,032
你不告訴我嗎？
You won't tell me?

960
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,584
- 你叫什麼名字？
- 簡單
What's your name?
Easy.

961
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,712
- 那不是真的名字
- 很容易記
That's not any kind of name.
It's easy to remember.

962
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,348
對，你叫什麼名字？
Yeah, but what's your reaI name?

963
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,073
我不喜歡我的名字
I don't Iike my reaI name.

964
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,391
你叫什麼名字
What's your reaI name?

965
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,639
艾瑞絲
Iris.

966
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,151
那有什麼問題？
它是個很美的名字
What's wrong? It's a nice name.

967
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,432
只有你才那麼想
That's what you think.

968
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,757
不，別那麼做，你不記得我嗎？
No, don't do that.
Don't you remember me?

969
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,070
還記得你搭上一輛計程車嗎？
一輛格紋計程車
Remember when you got into a
taxi? It was a checkered taxi.

970
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,436
你上車，麥修衝過來
You got in and that guy
Matthew came by...

971
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,074
他說他要把你帶走
...and he said he wanted to
take you away.

972
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,435
他拉你下車
He pulled you away.

973
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,794
我不記得
I don't remember that.

974
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,278
- 你完全不記得？
- 沒錯
You don't remember?

975
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,158
我要帶你離開這裡
I'm gonna get you out of here.

976
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,635
聽著，我們得快點做
不然小子會生氣
We better make it
or Sport will get mad.

977
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,957
- 你要怎麼做？
- 我不要做，誰是小子？
- How do you wanna make it?
- I don't want to. Who's Sport?

978
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,958
就是麥修，我都叫他小子
That's Matthew. I caII him Sport.

979
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,991
你要這麼做？
Wanna make it Iike this?

980
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,279
聽著，我…
Listen, I...

981
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,959
難道你不懂嗎？
Can't you understand something?

982
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,795
是你跳上我的計程車
你想離開這裡
You came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

983
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,479
我一定是茫了
I must've been stoned.

984
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,311
- 為什麼？他們對你下藥？
- 快脫了吧
Why? They drug you?
Come off it, man.

985
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,917
你在做什麼？
What are you doing?

986
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,151
你不想做嗎？
Don't you wanna make it?

987
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,470
不，我不想做，我想幫你
I don't wanna make it.
I wanna heIp you.

988
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,317
我可以幫你
Well, I could help you.

989
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,188
該死
Damn, man!

990
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,472
該死
Goddamn it!

991
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,671
該死，你到底是怎麼了？
Shit, man. What the hell's
the matter with you?

992
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,357
我們不一定要做，先生
We don't have to make it, mister.

993
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,596
該死，你不想離開這裡嗎？
Damn it!
Don't you want out of here?

994
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,999
你不懂為什麼我要來這裡嗎？
Can you understand why I'm here?

995
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,510
我想我瞭解
I think I understand.

996
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,031
我跳上你的計程車
I tried to get into your cab...

997
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,714
現在你要把我帶走
...and now you wanna come
and take me away.

998
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,556
- 對吧？
- 對，但你不想走嗎？
Is that it?
Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

999
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,714
- 我隨時都可以離開
- 那天晚上呢？
I can Ieave any time I want.
Then what about that one night?

1000
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,870
聽著，當時我茫了
Look, I was stoned.

1001
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,515
所以他們攔下我
That's why they stopped me.

1002
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,192
不嗑藥時，我沒有別的地方可去
When I'm not stoned I got
no pIace eIse to go.

1003
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,437
他們只是…
So they just...

1004
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,116
阻止我傷害自己
...protect me from myself.

1005
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,079
我不知道
I don't know.

1006
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,915
我不知道，好吧，我試過了
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

1007
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,115
聽著，我瞭解
I understand.

1008
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:17,394
- 這真的很偉大
- 對
And it means something, really.

1009
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,758
聽著，我可以再見到你嗎？
Well look, can I see you again?

1010
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,388
- 要那麼做不難
- 我不是那個意思
- That's not hard to do.
- Not Iike that.

1011
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,394
我是說固定見面
正常人不該這麼做
I mean, you know, reguIarIy.
This is nothing for a person to do.

1012
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,592
明天一起吃早餐吧？
How about breakfast tomorrow?

1013
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,791
- 明天嗎？
- 我一點起床
- Tomorrow?
- I get up at 1:00.

1014
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,429
- 一點？
- 一點
One o'clock?

1015
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,076
我有一個問題，我不知道…
Well, I got that thing.
I don't know--

1016
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,594
你到底要不要？
Do you want to or not?

1017
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,791
我要，好吧
Yeah, I want--
Okay, aII right.

1018
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,553
- 好吧，一點
- 一點
- One o'clock.
- One o'clock.

1019
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,433
好吧，明天見
Okay. See you tomorrow.

1020
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,597
艾瑞絲，我叫崔維斯
Oh, Iris. My name is Travis.

1021
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,950
謝謝你，崔維斯
Thanks a Iot, Travis.

1022
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,956
再見，艾瑞絲，明天見
So Iong, Iris.
See you tomorrow.

1023
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,271
甜美的艾瑞絲
Sweet Iris.

1024
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,151
這是你的
This is yours.

1025
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,992
好好花掉它
Spend it right.

1026
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,191
歡迎你隨時再度光臨，牛仔
Come back anytime, cowboy.

1027
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,239
我會的
I wiII.

1028
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,673
為什麼你要我回我父母身邊？
Why do you want me to go back
to my parents?

1029
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,399
他們恨我
They hate me.

1030
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,871
你覺得為什麼我要翹家？
我家裡什麼都沒有
Why do you think I spIit?
There ain't nothing there.

1031
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,636
對，但你不能過這樣的生活
這跟地獄差不多
But you can't Iive Iike this.
It's a heII.

1032
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,671
女孩就該住在家裡
A girI shouId Iive at home.

1033
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,351
你沒聽過女人的碎嘴嗎？
Didn't you ever hear of women's Iib?

1034
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,357
你是什麼意思？女人的碎嘴？
What do you mean, "women's lib"?

1035
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:19,398
你是個小女孩，你該待在家裡
You're a young girI.
You shouId be at home now.

1036
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,755
你該打扮得漂漂亮亮的
跟男孩出去
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys.

1037
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,518
你該去上學
You should be going to school.

1038
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,435
- 你知道的，做那些事
- 天啊，你真死板
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- Oh, God, are you square.

1039
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,711
我不死板，死板的人應該是你
I'm not square. You're square.

1040
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,757
你是滿嘴胡說八道
You're full of shit, man.

1041
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,195
你在胡說什麼？你在外面鬼混
What do you mean?
You walk out with...

1042
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,749
認識那些混蛋
低等生物跟下流傢伙
...fucking creeps,
IowIifes and degenerates...

1043
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,430
你為了一點小錢出賣靈肉？
...and you sell your little
pussy for nothing, man?

1044
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,557
為了一個低級的皮條客？
For some Iow-Iife pimp?

1045
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,870
他站在門廊邊
Stands in a hall.

1046
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,112
我很死板，很死板的人應該是你
I'm square? You're the one
that's square, man.

1047
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,710
我不會跟你一樣
找殺人兇手跟毒蟲上床
I don't go screw and fuck with
kiIIers and junkies Iike you.

1048
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,716
你說那是嬉皮生活？
You call that being hip?

1049
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,391
你到底是從哪裡來的？
What world you from?

1050
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:06,392
- 誰是殺人兇手？
- 小子是殺人兇手
Who's a killer?
That guy Sport's a killer.

1051
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,079
小子沒殺過人
Sport never killed nobody.

1052
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,759
- 他殺了…
- 他是天秤座
- He killed--
- He's a Libra.

1053
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,109
什麼？
He's a what?

1054
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,710
我也是天秤座，所以我們處得很好
I'm a Libra too.
That's why we get aIong so weII.

1055
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,759
我覺得他看起來很像殺人兇手
He Iooks Iike a kiIIer to me.

1056
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,635
我覺得巨蟹座是最棒的情人
I think that Cancers make
the best Iovers...

1057
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,071
我家人都是風象星座
...but my whole family's air signs.

1058
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,474
他還是個毒蟲
He's also a dope-shooter.

1059
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,637
為什麼你高人一等？
你能告訴我嗎？
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

1060
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,032
你看過鏡子裡的自己嗎？
Don't you ever Iook at your
own eyebaIIs in the mirror?

1061
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,429
你怎麼處理小子跟那個老頭？
What'II you do about
Sport and that oId guy?

1062
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,790
- 什麼時候？
- 你離開的時候
- When?
- When you Ieave.

1063
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,634
我會直接離開
I'II just Ieave them.

1064
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,671
- 直接離開？
- 他們會找到別的女孩
- Just Ieave?
- They got other girIs.

1065
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,792
你不能那麼做，你打算怎麼辦？
You can't just do that.
What are you gonna do?

1066
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,113
你要我報警？
Want me to call the cops?

1067
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,828
警察什麼都不會做，你知道的
The cops don't do nothing.
You know that.

1068
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:07,189
聽著，小子沒虐待過我
他沒打過我
Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up once.

1069
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,790
但你不能讓他以同樣的方法
對別的女孩
But you can't allow him to do
the same to other girls.

1070
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,552
你不能讓他那麼做
You can't allow him to do that.

1071
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,950
他是最低級的人
He's the Iowest kind of person.

1072
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,157
得有人好好教訓他
Somebody's got to do
something to him.

1073
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,793
他是人渣
He's the scum of the earth.

1074
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,559
他是我見過
He's the worst...

1075
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,348
最低級的人渣
...sucking scum I have ever,
ever seen.

1076
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,515
你知道他怎麼跟我說你的嗎？
You know what he told me about you?

1077
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,594
他罵你，他說你是雞
He called you names. He called
you a little piece of chicken.

1078
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:40,155
他不是真心的
He doesn't mean it.

1079
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,835
我要搬到佛蒙特的公社
I'II move up to one of them
communes in Vermont.

1080
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,192
我沒看過公社，我不知道
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know...

1081
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,516
我看過…
I saw...

1082
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,957
雜誌上面的照片
看起來不是很乾淨
...some photos once in a magazine.
It didn't Iook very cIean.

1083
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,431
你何不跟我一起去？
Why don't you come with me?

1084
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,229
什麼？跟你去公社？不
What? Come to the commune
with you? No, no.

1085
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,873
有何不可？
Why not?

1086
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,639
- 我不去那種地方
- 少來了，有何不可？
I don't go to pIaces Iike that.
Come on, why not?

1087
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,871
我無法那樣子跟別人相處
I don't get aIong with
peopIe Iike that.

1088
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,237
- 你是天蠍座嗎？
- 什麼？
Are you a Scorpion?

1089
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,870
沒錯，你是天蠍座
每次我都能猜對
That's it. You're a Scorpion.
I can teII every time.

1090
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,036
而且我得待在這裡
Besides, I gotta stay here.

1091
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,038
- 少來了，為什麼？
- 我有很重要的事要做
Come on. Why?
I got something important to do.

1092
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,838
什麼事那麼重要？
So what's so important?

1093
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,915
我在為政府工作
Doing something for the government.

1094
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,069
開計程車是兼差
The cab thing is just part-time.

1095
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,719
你是緝毒組的嗎？
Are you a narc?

1096
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,354
我看起來像緝毒組的嗎？
Do I Iook Iike a narc?

1097
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,912
對

1098
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,357
我是緝毒組的
I am a narc.

1099
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,910
天啊，我不知道你跟我
到底誰比較奇怪
God! I don't know who's
weirder, you or me.

1100
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:02,233
- 你真的不跟我走？
- 我會給你旅費
- Sure you don't wanna come with me?
- I'II give you the money to go.

1101
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,473
- 你不必那麼做
- 我要你收下錢
- You don't have to.
- I want you to take it.

1102
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,479
我不要你拿他們的錢
I don't want you to take
anything from them.

1103
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,518
我要這麼做
And I wanna do it.

1104
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,269
反正我有錢沒地方花
I don't have anything better
to do with my money.

1105
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,435
我得離開一陣子
I might be going away
for a whiIe.

1106
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,476
你只是有點緊張
You're just a IittIe tense,
that's aII.

1107
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,154
我不喜歡這麼做，小子
I don't Iike what I'm doing, Sport.

1108
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:52,438
寶貝，我不要你喜歡你做的事
Baby, I never wanted you
to Iike what you're doing.

1109
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,553
如果你喜歡你在做什麼事
你就不是我的女人
If you ever Iiked what you were doing,
you wouIdn't be my woman.

1110
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,788
你不再花時間陪我
You never spend any time
with me anymore.

1111
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,077
我忙著做生意，寶貝
Well, I got to attend
to business, baby.

1112
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,628
你想念你的男人，對吧？
You miss your man, don't you?

1113
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,356
我也不喜歡離開你
I don't Iike to be away
from you either.

1114
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,154
你知道我對你的感覺
You know how I feeI about you.

1115
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,231
我依靠你
I depend on you.

1116
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,829
沒有你，我會失去方向
I'd be Iost without you.

1117
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,754
別忘記那一點
Don't you ever forget that.

1118
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,469
我多麼需要你
How much I need you.

1119
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,391
來吧，寶貝
Come to me, baby.

1120
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,272
讓我抱著你
Let me hold you.

1121
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:04,112
當你這樣靠近我，我覺得好快樂
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

1122
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,316
我希望每個男人
都能知道被你愛的感覺
I onIy wish every man couId know
what it's Iike to be Ioved by you.

1123
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,238
每個女人
That every woman, everywhere...

1124
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:26,071
都有個男人愛她，就跟我愛你一樣
...had a man who Ioves her
Iike I Iove you.

1125
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,310
天啊，能抱著你感覺真棒
God, it's good so close.

1126
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,271
有時候在這樣的情況下
You know, at times Iike this...

1127
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,633
我知道我是個幸運兒
...I know I'm a Iucky man.

1128
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,671
觸碰一個要我，需要我的女人
Touching a woman who
wants me and needs me.

1129
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,118
因為你，我才能繼續活下去
It's onIy you that keeps me together.

1130
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:29,076
（親愛的艾瑞絲
這筆錢應該夠你離開了）

1131
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,670
（你看到這封信時
我已經死了，崔維斯）

1132
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,033
現在我明白了，我的一生
Now I see it clearly.
My whole life is pointed...

1133
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,515
只為了一件事活著，現在我懂了
... in one direction. I see that now.

1134
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,039
（艾瑞絲史提恩斯馬，私人信件）

1135
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,237
我沒有選擇
There never has been
any choice for me.

1136
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,717
（投帕蘭汀一票）

1137
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,395
各位先生女士
Ladies and gentlemen...

1138
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:28,912
歡迎未來的美國總統
查爾斯帕蘭汀參議員
...the next president of the U.S.,
Senator Charles Palantine.

1139
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,639
謝謝你，湯姆
Thank you, Tom.

1140
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,069
各位先生女士
Ladies and gentlemen...

1141
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:44,437
今天我們在十字路口見面
就在哥倫布圓環
...we are met today at a crossroads,
Columbus Circle.

1142
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,750
這裡不是普通的地方
This is no ordinary place.

1143
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,750
許多道路
許多人的性命在這裡交會
It is a pIace where many roads
and many Iives intersect.

1144
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,593
今天我們在這裡見面再適合不過
It is appropriate that
we meet here today...

1145
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:59,156
因為現在不是普通的年代
...because these are not ordinary times.

1146
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,432
我們來到歷史的十字路口
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1147
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,953
（我們是人民）

1148
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:07,795
我們在錯誤的道路上走了太久
For far too Iong, the wrong roads
have been taken.

1149
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:12,278
錯誤的道路帶我們走向戰爭跟貧窮
The wrong roads have Ied us
into war, into poverty...

1150
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,398
走向失業跟通貨膨脹
...into unemployment and inflation.

1151
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,955
今天我要跟你們說
我們已經到了轉折點
Today I say to you,
we have reached the turning point.

1152
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,958
很快地人民不必再為少數人受苦
No Ionger wiII we, the peopIe,
suffer for the few.

1153
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:40,438
如果我說新道路會一帆風順
我是在說謊
I wouId Iie to you if I toId you
the new roads wouId be easy.

1154
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,156
那一點都不簡單
They will not be easy.

1155
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,955
正確的決定從來都不簡單
Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.

1156
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,151
人民知道這一點
We, the people, know that.

1157
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:57,398
人們知道正確的道路
And we, the people,
know the right roads and the good.

1158
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,712
今天我要跟大家說
你跟我，我們是人民
Today I say to you,
we are the peopIe, you and I.

1159
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,191
該開始讓人民統治政府
And it is time to Iet the peopIe ruIe!

1160
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:07,674
謝謝
Thank you.

1161
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,189
好吧，讓他過去，退後
AII right, Iet him through. PuII back.

1162
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,076
帕蘭汀

1163
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,558
謝謝

1164
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,833
那邊，盯著那傢伙
Over there. Get that man.

1165
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,758
給他一些空間
Give him some air!

1166
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,391
給他一些空間，好嗎？
Give him some air, will you?

1167
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,557
- 我沒見過他
- 我看到他逃走
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

1168
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,717
- 我看到他
- 他在哪裡？
- I saw him.
- Where was he?

1169
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,549
發生了什麼事？
What's happening?

1170
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,079
拿到錢了嗎？
Got the money?

1171
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:41,429
- 艾瑞絲在房裡？
- 對
Iris in her room?

1172
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,113
好吧

1173
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,796
小子，你好嗎？
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1174
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,110
我很好，你…
Okay, okay, my man. How--

1175
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,478
- 我們認識嗎？
- 我不知道
- Where do I know you from, man?
- I don't know.

1176
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,989
拉皮條生意不錯吧？
How's everything in the pimp business?

1177
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,310
- 我認識你嗎？
- 不
Do I know you?
No.

1178
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,993
我認識你嗎？
Do I know you?

1179
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,111
滾開，快點，別煩我
Get out of here. Get Iost.

1180
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,958
我認識你嗎？
Do I know you?

1181
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,679
艾瑞絲還好吧？
How's Iris?

1182
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,313
你認識艾瑞絲
You know Iris.

1183
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,273
不，我不認識叫艾瑞絲的人
No, I don't know nobody named Iris.

1184
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,590
艾瑞絲？快點給我滾
Iris? Come on, get out of here, man.

1185
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:54,790
- 你不認識叫艾瑞絲的人？
- 我不認識艾瑞絲
You don't know Iris?
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1186
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,514
是嗎？
No?

1187
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,400
快滾回家，免得你受到傷害
Get back to your tribe
before you get hurt.

1188
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:02,114
我不想惹麻煩，好嗎？
I don't want no troubIe, okay?

1189
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,033
你有槍嗎？
You got a gun?

1190
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:09,357
快給我滾開
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1191
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,472
去死吧
Suck on this.

1192
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,549
嘿

1193
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,756
你這個瘋子
You crazy son of a bitch!

1194
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,433
大混蛋
Fucking son of a bitch!

1195
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,551
我要殺了你
I'II kiII you!

1196
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:37,471
我要殺了你
I'II kiII you! I'II kiII you!
I'II fucking kiII you!

1197
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,830
瘋子，我要殺了你
Son of a bitch!
I'II kiII you!

1198
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,799
瘋子

1199
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,430
大混蛋，我要殺了你
You fucking bastard! I'II kiII you!

1200
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,757
瘋子，我要殺了你
You crazy son of a bitch!
I'II kiII you!

1201
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,993
我要殺了你

1202
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,632
住手

1203
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,555
別殺他
Don't shoot him!

1204
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,594
（計程車司機力抗黑幫份子）

1205
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,599
親愛的畢克先生
Dear Mr. Bickle.

1206
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,799
我無法形容
史提恩斯馬太太跟我有多開心
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were...

1207
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,952
聽說你沒事，病情有所好轉
... to hear that you are
well and recuperating.

1208
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:20,038
我們到紐約接艾瑞絲時
We tried to visit you at the hospital...

1209
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,953
試著到醫院看你
... when we were in New York
to pick up Iris...

1210
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,800
那時你還在昏迷中
...but you were still in a coma.

1211
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,116
我們無法報答你
There is no way we can repay you...

1212
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,477
幫我們找回艾瑞絲
... for returning our Iris to us.

1213
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,432
我們以為我們失去她了
We thought we had lost her...

1214
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:36,791
現在我們的生活恢復正常
...and now our lives are full again.

1215
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,639
不用多說
Needless to say...

1216
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:43,356
你是這個家的英雄
...you are something
of a hero around this household.

1217
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:47,590
我相信你會想知道艾瑞絲的近況
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.

1218
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:51,315
她回到學校，非常用功
She's back in school and working hard.

1219
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,637
調整生活腳步對她來說很難
The transition has been
very hard for her...

1220
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,159
你應該想像得到
...as you can well imagine.

1221
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:57,469
（計程車司機英雄康復中）

1222
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,193
但我們一步步地慢慢來
But we have taken steps to see...

1223
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:03,638
不希望她再逃家
...she has never cause
to run away again.

1224
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,633
簡單地來說
In conclusion...

1225
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,594
史提恩斯馬太太跟我打從心裡
...Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you...

1226
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,513
想要再度感謝你
... from the bottom of our hearts.

1227
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:16,793
不幸地我們沒錢再到紐約
Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again...

1228
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,959
親自感謝你
不然我們一定會那麼做
... to thank you in person,
or we surely would.

1229
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:24,033
如果你有機會到匹茲堡
But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh...

1230
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:28,836
我們非常歡迎你到家裡來玩
...you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.

1231
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:34,029
非常感激你
柏特與艾薇史提恩斯馬
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma.

1232
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:39,518
老闆艾迪走過來說「我要換輪胎」
Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up
and says, " I want to swap tires."

1233
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,312
我說「這是新輪胎」
I say, "These are new tires.

1234
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,713
「為什麼你不丟掉別的東西？
譬如說你太太？」
Why not throw in something else,
like your wife?"

1235
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,993
- 他太太是1957年紐澤西小姐
- 所以車行沒有備胎
She was Miss New Jersey, 1957.
That's why the fleet has no spares.

1236
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,634
麵團男孩，巫師，殺手
Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.

1237
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,229
- 查理
- 發生了什麼事？
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1238
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,751
崔維斯，你有客人了
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1239
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,554
該死
Shit.

1240
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,753
待會見
Well, see you later.

1241
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,678
再見，崔維斯
See you, Travis.

1242
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,597
你好，崔維斯
Hello, Travis.

1243
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,234
你好
Hello.

1244
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,919
聽說帕蘭汀獲得提名
I hear PaIantine got the nomination.

1245
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,272
對，就快了，還有17天
Yeah, won't be Iong now.
Seventeen days.

1246
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,197
我希望他能當選
Well, I hope he wins.

1247
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,917
我在報上看到你的新聞
你還好吧？
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1248
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,479
真的沒什麼，我已經挺過來了
It was nothing, reaIIy.
I got over that.

1249
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,474
媒體就是喜歡誇大
Papers always blow these things up.

1250
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:32,596
我只是受了一點小傷
Just a IittIe stiffness. That's aII.

1251
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,831
崔維斯
Travis...

1252
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:12,756
I'm...

1253
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,278
多少錢？
How much was it?

1254
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,799
再見
So Iong.
