看起来像是个天使
She appeared like an angel...

102
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,500
堕入这个尘世

103
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,880
她独自一个人
She is alone.

104
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,830
他们...
They...

105
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,710
无法...
cannot...

106
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,590

Now, all the ones we had before and our slogan is...

114
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,510
"我们是人民""是"划线做强调
"We are the people," and "are" is underlined.

115
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,190
新胸章划线强调"我们"
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

116
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,990
念起来变成"我们是人民"  感觉不一样
That reads, "We are the people." Well, I think there's a difference.

117
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,150
"我们是人民"  不同于"我们是人民"
"We are the people" is not the same as "We are the people."

118
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,430
别吵了
Let's not fight.

119

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,060
那不是真正的监狱
It's not really jail.

139
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,760
当然跟他太太同住跟坐牢差不多
Of course, with his wife, anything would be jail.

140
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,030
看一下那边
Look over there.

141
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,470
我爱你
I love you.

142
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,830
你有发现任何异状吗
Notice anything?

143
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,230
-没有  -戴上眼镜
- No. - Well, put your glasses on.

144
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,030
好吧  等一下  好吧
Okay, just a minute. All right.

145
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,540
那个计程车司机盯着我们看
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

146
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,100
什么计程车司机
What taxi driver?

147
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,430
坐在那边的计程车司机
The one that's sitting there.

148
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,030
-他在那里多久了   -我不知道  但感觉很久了
- How long has he been there? - It feels like a long time.

149
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,060
-他有骚扰你吗   -不
- Does he bother you? - No.

150
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,350
你是说有  你的口气很讽刺
You mean yes. You're being sarcastic.

151
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,430
你真的很机灵
You're quick. You're really quick.

152
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,190
我努力机灵一点
I try to be real quick.

153
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,670
我会假装是你的男朋友
I'll play the maIe in this reIationship...

154
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,100
祝你好运
Good luck.

155
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,670
请他离开  我不需要祝福  谢谢
and tell him to move. And I don't need good luck.

156
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,630
不  你绝对需要  你只是在逞英雄
Oh yes, you do. You just think you don't.

157
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,170
你挡到我们的门口了
You're blocking our doorway.

158
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,630
你可以把计程车移开吗
You think you might move your cab?

159
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,590
奥柯特饭店

160
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,070
眼影  睫毛膏
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

161
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,790
口红  胭脂
Lipstick, rouge.

162
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,870
不是胭脂  她们说那是腮红
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

163
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,470
-用刷子刷的那一种  -对  那是腮红
- The kind with the brush. - Yeah, it's Blush-on.

164
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,310
崔维斯
Travis

165
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,340
-威兹  -那是腮红  我太太会用
- Hey, Wiz. - That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

166
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,630
问崔维斯吧  他很懂女人
Ask Travis. He's a Iadies' man.

167
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,270
请给我一杯咖啡
A cup of coffee.

168
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,270
总之不论那是什么东西  她涂了一大堆
Whatever the fuck it is, she uses a lot of it.

169
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,860
还有香水  喷在身上的那一种
And then perfume. The spray kind.

170
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,590
听着  在三区大桥中间
Then in the middle of the Triboro Bridge...

171
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,030
这个女人美呆了  她在换丝袜
And this woman is beautiful, she changes her pantyhose.

172
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,500
-不  -没错
- No. - Oh, yeah.

173
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,430
-你做了什么  -我拔掉计费表
- What'd you do? - I throw the man out,

174
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,470
跳到后座  挥舞着它
and I jump in the back seat and whip it out.

175
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,390
我说"你知道这是什么吗"
And I said, "You know what this is?"

176
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,390
她说"这是爱"  我跟她共享鱼水之欢
She says, "It's love." I fuck her brains out.

177
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,230
她春情大发  她说
She goes wild and says,

178
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,150
"那是我一生最棒的性经验"
"That's the greatest single experience of my life."

179
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,050
她给了我两百块小费
Then she gave me a $200 tip...

180
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,910
还有她在阿卡普科的电话号码
and her phone number in Acapulco.

181
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,430
崔维斯  你认识面团男孩查理吗
You know Doughboy, Charlie T.

182
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,830
崔维斯  你有零钱吗
Hey, Travis. Got change for a nickeI?

183
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,420
只要一块钱  面团男孩什么都愿意做
Doughboy will do anything for a buck.

184
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,670
怎么样
So how's it hanging?

185
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,310
什么
What's that?

186
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,190
我听了广播  贝尔车行的司机被杀
I turn on the radio. Some fleet driver from Bell just got all cut up.

187
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,470
是抢劫吗
Stickup?

188
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,390
不  他被疯子杀了  半边耳朵都被割下来
No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.

189
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,230
-在哪里   -122街
- Where? - It was on 122nd Street.

190
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,830
该死的疯狂世界
Fucking Mau Mau land.

191
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,120
崔维斯  你是全城跑吧
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?

192
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,590
崔维斯
Travis

193
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,350
崔维斯
Travis

194
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,510
-你是全城跑吧   -对
- You run all over town, don't you? - Emrr.

195
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,060
你得应付很难缠的客人吧
You handle some pretty rough customers.

196
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,790
没错
Yeah, I have.

197
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,270
-你有带枪吗   -没有
- You carry a piece? - No.

198
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,550
-你需要枪吗   -不用
- You need one? - No.

199
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,990
我认识一个家伙能帮你弄到好枪
I know a fella who can get you a real nice deal.

200
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,070
坏人真的很多
Lots of shit around.

201
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,740
我从来不用枪  我很保守
I never use mine. I'm conservative.

202
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,830
但带着它总是有些威吓作用
But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.

203
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,070
我得去八卦一下
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

204
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,950
崔维斯
Travis

205
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,700
看吧
Look.

206
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,060
艾洛佛林的浴缸碎片
Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

207
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,190
看一下图案
Dig the symbols.

208
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,220
F405434 F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

209

还有浮水印
And the watermark.

210
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,150
一个人
There's one person...

211
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,030
两个人
there's two persons...

212
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,750
三个人
and there's three persons.

213
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,150
我在他住的松林屋拿到的
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

214
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,620
你何不把它拿走  如果你能卖掉它
Take it, and if you can sell it, you give me...

215
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,630
-分我一半说可以了  -我不想
- half of what you got. - I don't want to.

216
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,550
我要去开车乐一下了
I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.

217
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,000
我真的很抱歉

218
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,030
-什么都没有  -那真的很可爱  谢谢
- Nothing. - That's very cute. Thank you.

219
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,110
你要看一样东西吗
Hey, you wanna see something?

220
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,870
等一下  我打错了"你要看一样东西吗"
Wait, I just typed, "You wanna see something?"

221
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,870
-什么   -如果你这只手
- What? - If you had...

222
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,310
少了三根手指
these three fingers missing on this hand...

223
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,790
那只手断了
and that hand missing on that hand...

224
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,670
-你怎么点火柴   -我就不能点了
- how would you light the match? - I wouldn't light a match.

225
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,030
来吧  试试看
Go ahead. Give it a try.

226
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,990
我想我办不到
Well, I don't think I could do it.

227
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,500
是吗
No?

228
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,390
那一定很难
It's gonna be difficult.

229
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,430
我会试试看
I'll give it a try.

230
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,270
我的拇指长回来了  谢天谢地
I got my thumb back for a second. Thank God.

231
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,990
等一下
Just a minute.

232
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,020
我办不到
I can't do it.

233
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,270
报摊那家伙可以
The guy at the newsstand can.

234
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,550
我不在报摊工作
Well, I don't work at a newsstand.

235
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,790
-他可能是意大利人  -才不是
- Anyway, he's probably Italian. - No.

236
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,590
-你确定   -他是黑人
- You're sure? - He's black.

237
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,110
如果他是意大利人  或许他是小偷  黑道都那样
If he had been Italian, he might've been a thief.

238
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,940
如果小偷搞砸了  他们会炸断他的手指
If a thief screws up on the job, the mob bIows his fingers off.

239
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,700
那听起来像是玩笑  却是真的
This sounds like a joke, but it's true.

240
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,110
如果他们杀了密探  会在尸体上放只金丝雀
If they kill a stooI pigeon, they leave a canary on the body.

241
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,590
-那是一种象征  -为什么不用鸽子来取代金丝雀
- It's symboIic. - Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

242
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,510
我不知道为什么不用鸽子  等一下
I don't know why not. Wait a minute.

243
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,590
你得去抓鸽子  如果是金丝雀  你可以走进宠物店
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary, you can walk into a pet store...

244
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,590
嘭  当场杀了它  爱把它放在谁身上都可以
kill it right there. Put it on anyone you want.

245
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,950
-我想当志工  -太棒了  由我来为你服务
- I'd like to volunteer. - I'll take you right over here.

246
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,790
如果你不介意  我想当她的志工
I'd rather volunteer to her, if you don't mind.

247
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,910
为什么你要当我的志工
Why do you have to volunteer to me?

248
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,230
因为你是我见过最美的女人
Because you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.

249
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,030
谢谢
Thanks.

250
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,510
你对帕兰汀有什么看法
But what do you think of Palantine?

251
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,710
我...
I...

252
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,150
帕兰汀  你来当志工  帮忙他竞选总统
The man you're volunteering to help elect President.

253
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,590
我相信他会是个好总统
I'm sure he'll make a good President.

254
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,240
我不知道他有什么政策
I don't know what his policies are,

255
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,190
但我相信他会是个好总统
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

256
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,270
-你要加入游说   -对  我要加入游说
- Do you want to canvass? - Yeah, I'll canvass.

257
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,070
你对参议员的福利政策立场  有什么看法
How do you feel about his stand on welfare?

258
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,710
我不知道他有什么福利政策立场
I don't really know his stand on welfare,

259
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,710
但我相信那会是个好立场
but I'm sure it's a good stand.

260
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,870
-你确定吗   -对
- You're sure of that? - Yeah.

261
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,510
我们得日夜在这里一起工作
We all work together here, day and night...

262
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,910
我相信男士们会帮你报名
so I'm sure the gentlemen will sign you up over there.

263
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,670
问题是晚上我得开计程车  这对我来说有点难
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night, so it's kind of hard for me...

264
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,030
我没办法在白天工作
to work in the day.

265
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,310
你到底要做什么
Then what exactly do you want?

266
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,270
你愿意跟我一起喝咖啡吃派吗
Would you like to have coffee and pie with me?

267
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,700
为什么
Why?

268
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,150
-为什么  我来告诉你为什么  -对
- Why? I'll tell you why. - Yeah?

269
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,430
我想你是个寂寞的人
I think you're a lonely person.

270
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,260
我常开车经过这里看到你
I drive by a lot, and I see you here.

271
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,470
我看到你身边有很多人
I see a lot of people around you...

272
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,750
看到电话跟你桌上的东西
and I see these phones and all this stuff on your desk...

273
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,310
那一点意义都没有
and it means nothing.

274
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,630
我走进来见你
And when I came inside and met you...

275
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,590
看到你的眼神跟你的一举一动
I saw in your eyes and how you carried yourself...

276
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,030
你不是个快乐的人
that you're not a happy person.

277
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,390
我想你需要做一些事情
And I think you need something.

278
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,510
如果你需要朋友  我可以当你的朋友
If you wanna call it a friend, you can call it that.

279
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,780
-你要当我的朋友   -对
- You're gonna be my friend? - Yeah.

280
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,190
你觉得如何
What do you say?

281
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,600
站在这里等答案有点糗
It's a little hard standing here and asking you, so...

282
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,990
五分钟  就那样  就在外面  就在附近
Five minutes, that's all. Just outside. Right around here.

283
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,590
我会保护你
I'm there to protect you.

284
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,860
来吧  休息一下
Come on. Just take a little break.

285
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,510
四点时我有空  如果你还在...
I have a break at 4:00. If you're here...

286
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,750
-今天四点   -对
- 4:00 today? - Yeah.

287
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,870
-我会到的  -我相信一定会的
- I'll be here. - I'm sure you will.

288
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,990
-好吧  下午四点  -对
- All right. Four p.m. - Right.

289
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,030
-前门见   -对
- Outside in the front? - Yes.

290
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,460
好的
OK

291
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,100
我是崔维斯  你是贝茜
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

292
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,910
崔维斯
Travis.

293
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,670
谢谢你  贝茜
I appreciate this, Betsy.

294
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,630
5月26日  下午4点
May 26th, four o'clock p.m.

295
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,750
我带贝茜  到哥伦布圆环的查理咖啡厅
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop on Columbus Circle.

296
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,300
我点了黑咖啡跟苹果派
I had black coffee and apple pie with...

297
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,390
还有一片融化的黄起司
a slice of melted yellow cheese.

298
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,830
我想那是不错的选择
I think that was a good selection.

299
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,390
贝茜点了咖啡跟水果沙拉
Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.

300
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,510
她爱吃什么都可以
She could've had anything she wanted.

301
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,430
光在纽约就有一万五千名志工  那不算太糟糕
15,000 volunteers in New York alone isn't bad.

302
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,470
却有组织问题
But the organizationaI probIems!

303
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,590
对  我了解你的意思  我有相同的问题
Yeah, I know what you mean. I got the same probIems.

304
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,900
我得组织一下  一些小事  譬如我的公寓跟私人物品
I gotta get organized. LittIe things, like my apartment, my possessions.

305
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,510
我应该贴张标语"总有一天我得高潮一下"
I should get a sign: "One of these days, I'll get organiz-ized."

306
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,390
你是说"组织吗"
You mean "organized"?

307
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,470
高潮
Organiz-ized.

308
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,140
高潮  那是玩笑
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

309
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,630
高潮
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

310
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,110
你是说"高潮"  就跟办公室标语"快闪"一样
You mean "organiz-ized." Like those signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

311
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,710
你喜欢你工作的地方吗
Do you like where you work?

312
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,070
我有很多好同事  我想帕兰汀当选机会很高
We've got some good people. Palantine's got a good chance.

313
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,270
你知道你的眼睛很漂亮吗
You know you have beautiful eyes?

314
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,950
你喜欢跟你一起工作的家伙吗
Do you like the guy you work with?

315
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,790
他人不错
He's okay.

316
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,030
对  我知道  但你喜欢他吗
Yeah, I know. But do you like him?

317
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,770
他很风趣  工作能力不错
He's funny and very good at his job.

318
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,990
虽然他有些问题
Though he does have a few problems.

319
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,390
我就知道他有些问题
I'd say he has quite a few probIems.

320
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,150
他的体力用错了地方
His energy seems to go in the wrong places.

321
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,590
我走进去时看到你们坐在一起
When I walked in and I saw you two sitting there...

322
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,670
我看得出来你们没有火花
I could just tell that there was no connection...

323
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,270
没有任何关系
whatsoever.

324
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,710
一走进去  我觉得我们之间有感觉
And when I walked in, there was something between us.

325
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,630
我们都是冲动型的人
There was an impulse we were both following.

326
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,550
所以我该跟你说话
So that gave me the right to talk to you.

327
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,500
不然我会觉得我不该跟你说话
Otherwise, I never would've had the right to talk to you.

328
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,750
我会没有勇气跟你说话
I never would've had the courage to talk to you.

329
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,110
他没有给我那样的感觉
And with him, I feIt there was nothing.

330
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,500
一走进去  我知道我是对的
When I walked in, I knew I was right.

331
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,390
你也是那么想的吗
Did you feel that way?

332
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,270
要不是我那么想  我也不会坐在这里
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

333
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,860
你是哪里人
Where are you from?

334
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,590
纽约州北部
Upstate.

335
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,310
我不喜欢那个家伙
That fellow, I don't like him.

336
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,510
不是那种不喜欢  我只是觉得他很蠢
Not that I don't like him, I just think he's silly.

337
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,230
我想他不尊敬你
I don't think he respects you.

338
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,470
我想我没见过像你这样的人
I don't beIieve I've ever met anyone quite like you.

339
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,550
你要跟我
You wanna go to...

340
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,550
去看电影吗
a movie with me?

341
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,540
我得回去上班
I have to go back to work now.

342
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,030
我不是说现在  下次
I don't mean now, like another time?

343
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,990
没问题  你知道你让我想起什么吗
Sure. You know what you remind me of?

344
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,350
-什么   -那首歌
- What? - That song...

345
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,590
克里斯克里斯多佛森的歌
by Kris Kristofferson.

346
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,190
-他是谁   -词曲创作人
- Who's that? - The songwriter.

347
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,950
"他是先知"
" He's a prophet...

348
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,910
"他是先知跟鼓动者"
He's a prophet and a pusher...

349
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,150
"半真半假  充满矛盾"
partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction."

350
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,230
你是在说我吗
You saying that about me?

351
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,150
不然我会说谁呢
Who else would I be talking about?

352
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,470
我不是鼓动者  我从来不鼓动别人
I'm no pusher. I've never pushed.

353
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,380
不  我是指矛盾的那个部份
Just the part about the contradictions.

354
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,430
你给人那种感觉
You are that.

355
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,820
我又打电话到办公室找贝茜  她说明天下班后
I called Betsy again. She said maybe we'd go to a movie...

356
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,950
或许我们可以去看电影  那天我休假
after work tomorrow. That's my day off.

357
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,930
刚开始她有些犹豫
At first she hesitated,

358
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,350
但我又打电话给她  她答应了
but I called her again and she agreed.

359
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,510
贝茜  不
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.

360
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,430
贝茜姓什么  我忘了问她的姓氏
Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name.

361
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,910
该死  我得记住那样的事
Damn! I gotta remember stuff like that.

362
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,790
别担心自己跑来的人
Don't worry about anyone committing themselves...

363
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,670
除非加州那边开始有动作
untiI things come in from California.

364
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,790
听着  我想我们该等礼车
Listen, I think we should've waited for the Iimo.

365
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,790
我不介意搭计程车  但我介意
I don't mind the cab, but I mind...

366
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,790
不做好准备就跑到加州  那会害我们惹上麻烦
going to California without the right preparation.

367
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,030
你是候选人查尔斯帕兰汀吗
Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?

368
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,670
我就是
Yes, I am.

369
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,310
我是你的支持者
I tell everybody that

370
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,950
我告诉所有搭车的人都得投你一票
comes in this taxi that they have to vote for you.

371
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,750
谢谢你
Why, thank you...

372
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,870
崔维斯
Travis.

373
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,030
我相信你一定会当选  我认识的人都要投你一票
I'm sure you'll win. Everybody I know will vote for you.

374
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,620
我要把你的贴纸贴在我车上
I was gonna put your sticker in my taxi...

375
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,220
但车行说那违反公司政策
but the company said it was against their policy.

376
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,590
他们是一群混蛋
They're a bunch of jerks.

377
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,670
我得说搭计程车比坐礼车
Let me tell you, I have learned more about America...

378
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,070
让我更能够了解民情
from riding in cabs than in all the limos in the U.S.

379
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,790
-是吗   －一点都没错
- Oh, yeah? - That's true.

380
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,840
-我能问你一件事吗  崔维斯  -当然可以
- Can I ask you something, Travis? - Sure.

381
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,190
这个国家让你最困扰的事是什么
What bugs you the most about this country?

382
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,710
我不知道  我不是很关心政治议题
Well, I don't know. I don't follow political issues that closely, sir.

383
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,430
一定有事让你困扰
Well, there must be something.

384
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,790
不论如何  他该整顿这个城市
Well, whatever it is, he should clean up this city here...

385
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,510
因为这个城市像开放式下水道  到处是垃圾跟人渣
because it's like an open sewer. It's full of fiIth and scum.

386
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,830
有时候我觉得快要受不了
Sometimes I can hardIy take it.

387
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,030
当选总统的人应该
Whatever becomes the President should just...

388
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,790
好好加以整顿  你了解我的意思吗
really clean it up. You know what I mean?

389
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,660
有时一出门我会闻到臭味  我会头痛  真的很臭
Sometimes I go out and I smell it. I get headaches, it's so bad.

390
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,950
它们像是...  臭味永远不会消失  你懂吗
And they just never go away, you know?

391
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,550
我想总统应该
I think that the President should just...

392
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,550
好好处理这个问题  把所有垃圾冲进马桶里
clean up this mess. He should flush it right down the fucking toilet.

393
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,190
我想我了解你的意思  崔维斯
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

394
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,430
要那么做并不容易
But it's not gonna be easy.

395
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,110
-我们得采取激烈改变  －一点都没错
- We'll have to make radicaI changes. - Damn straight.

396
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,510
拿去吧  崔维斯  不用找了
Here you go. Keep the change.

397
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,030
谢谢
Thank you.

398
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,550
-很高兴能跟你聊天  -我也是
- Nice talking to you. - Nice talking to you, sir.

399
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,140
你是个好人  我知道你会当选的
You're a good man. I know you're gonna win.

400
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,350
谢谢你  小心开车
Thank you, I think.

401
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,480

你想被抓吗
You wanna get busted?

406
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,630
臭女孩  冷静点

司机  忘了这一切  没事的
Cabbie, just forget about this.

409

冷静点  臭女孩
Be cool, bitch!

410
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,030
怎么了  宝贝
What's wrong? Baby.

411
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,390
给我滚开
Get your ass out of here!

412
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,830
-你好  -嗨

413
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,350
-今天还好吗   -没什么特别的
- Have a nice day today? - Not particularly.

414
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,230
我帮你准备了礼物
Got a present for you.

415
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,150
等一下是克鲁帕的切分风格
Now back to Gene Krupa's syncopated style shortly.

416
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,500
为什么你要那么做
Why'd you do that?

417
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,670
不然我的钱要花在什么地方
What else am I gonna do with my money?

418
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,150
我希望你能听一下
I wish you'd have listened to this.

419
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,750
我也想听  但我的唱机不能用
I would have, except my record player doesn't work now.

420
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,190
你的音响坏了
Your stereo's broken?

421
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,860
你怎么受得了  没音乐我活不下去
How do you stand it? I can't live without music.

422
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,740
我不常听音乐  但我很喜欢音乐
I don't follow music too much, but I would really like to.

423
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,870
你还没听过这张唱片
Then you haven't played this record yet.

424
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,550
没错
No

425
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,070
我想我们可以用你的唱机  一起听一下
But I was thinking maybe we could listen to it on your record player.

426
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,990

- I don't like these movies. - Well, I mean...

445
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,910
我不知道你对这部电影  会有那样的感觉
I didn't know you'd feel that way about this movie.

446
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,030
-早知道的话...  -你只会看这些电影
- If I had... - Are these the only movies you go to?

447
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,230
对  我说我会来...  这里还不错
Yeah, I mean I come and this is not so bad.

448
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,270
带我来这种地方  像是在鼓励我说"跟我上床吧"
Taking me here is as exciting to me as saying, "Let's fuck."

449
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,320
我可以带你到别的地方
There are other movies I can take you to.

457
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,750
你不能跟我谈吗  我不知道你...
Won't you at Ieast to talk to me? I didn't know you...

458
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,310

464
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,790

你感觉好一点了吗
Are you feeling better or...?

470
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,620
或许你被病毒感染  24小时病毒  你知道的
Maybe you had a virus or something. A 24-hour virus, you know.

471
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,150
的确会发生那种事
It can happen. Yeah.

472
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,430
你一直都忙着工作  对
You've been working hard, huh?

473
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,790
你要跟我吃晚餐吗
Would you like to have some dinner with me...

474
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,670

要不要喝杯咖啡
How about a cup of coffee?

我可以去总部  我们可以...
I could come by the headquarters or something, and we could...

477
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,350

Okay, okay.

478
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,550
你有收到我的花吗
Did you get my flowers and the...?

479
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,830

我试着打过几次电话给她
I tried several times to call her...

486
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,430
自从第一通电话后  她再也不肯接我电话
but after the first call, she wouldn't come to the phone.

487
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,260
我还送花过去  她没有反应
I also sent flowers, but with no luck.

488
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,110
花香让我病得更重
The smell of the flowers made me sicker.

489
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,870
头痛更厉害  我想我得了胃癌
The headaches got worse. I think I got stomach cancer.

- Let's not have trouble. - Why won't you talk to me?

你以为我不知道你在这里
You think I don't know you're here?

500

-请你离开  -把你的手拿开
- Please leave. - Take your hands off!

502
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,190
我只是要你知道...
I just want you to know...

503
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,860
请你离开  这里不适合这么做
Please. This is no place to do this.

504
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,150
把你的手拿开
- Take your hands off!

505
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,030
-把你的手拿开  -请你离开

506
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,350

- All right, leave, then! - I wanna tell you...

507
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,200
你会堕入地狱  你会跟其他人一样死后堕入地狱
you're in hell! And you'll die in hell.

508
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,150
-来吧  那边有警察  -你跟其他人一样
- There's a cop over there. - You're like the rest of them.

听着  我要报警了  警官
Look, I'm calling the cop. Officer!

510
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,070
警官
Officer!

511
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,030
听着  别到这里来  我会报警的
Don't come around here, because I'll call the police!

512
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,950
现在我知道她跟其他人有多像  冷漠又疏离
I realize now, how much she's just like the others, cold and distant.

513
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,830
许多人都是那个样子
Many people are like that.

514
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,350
特别是女人  她们都一样
Women for sure. They're like a union.

515

518
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,470
该死的计费表  你在做什么
The fucking meter. What are you doing?

519
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,830
你对计费表做了什么
What are you doing with the meter?

520
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,190
我有叫你...  我有叫你对计费表那么做吗
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

521
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,470
把计费表装回去  继续计费
Put the meter back.

522
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,350
我不在乎必须付多少钱

把它装上去  坐好
Put the thing down. Just sit.

529
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,550
我没要你写东西  我跟你说"停车"
I didn't tell you to write. I just said, "Pull over."

530
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,260
我们在路边停车  我们得坐在这里
Pull over to the curb and sit here.

00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,240
司机  你看到那盏灯了吗   那扇窗户
Cabbie, you see that light up there? In the window?

534
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,390
那盏灯  二楼的窗户
The light? The window in the second floor.

535
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,990
最靠近大楼边的那扇窗户
The one that's closest to the edge of the building.

536
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,590
亮着灯的窗户  就在二楼
The light up in the window. Second story.

00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,950
你怎么了  你瞎了吗
What are you, blind?

538
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,790
你看到灯了吗
Do you see the light?

539
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,550
-对  -你看到了  太好了
- Yeah. - you see it. Good.

540
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,830
你看到那个女人了吗
See the woman?

541
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,190
你看到窗里的那个女人了吗
Do you see the woman in the window?

542
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,350
-对  -你看到那个女人了  很好
- Yeah. - Do you see the woman in the window?

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,430
我要你看那个女人  因为她是我太太
I want you to see that woman because that's my wife.

544
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,790
但那不是我的公寓
But that's not my apartment.

545
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,430
那不是我的公寓  你知道谁住在那里吗
It's not my apartment. You know who lives there?

546
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,030
不  我是说你不会知道  你知道谁住在那里吗
No, you wouldn't know. But you know who lives there?

547
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,950
一个黑鬼住在那里
A nigger lives there.

548
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,030
你会想怎么做
How do you like that?

549
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,190
我要杀了她
And I'm gonna kill her.

550
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,310
没有别的办法  我要杀了她
There's nothing else. I'm gonna kill her.

551
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,510
你有什么想法
What do you think of that?

552
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,470
我说你有什么想法
I said, "What do you think of that?"

553
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,390
别回答
Don't answer.

554
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,830
你不必回答我
You don't have to answer everything.

555
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,790
我要拿点44麦格农手枪杀了她
I'm gonna kill her with a .44 Magnum pistol.

556
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,510
我有点44麦格农手枪  我要拿那把枪杀了她
I have a .44 Magnum pistol. I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

557
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,550
你知道点44麦格农手枪  能对女人的脸造成多大杀伤力吗
Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum can do to a woman's face?

558
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,670
我是说它能打烂她的脸  把她的脸轰烂
It'd fucking destroy it. Just bIow it right apart.

559
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,150
那把枪可以轰烂她的脸
That's what it can do to a face.

560
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,630
你知道它对女人的私处  有多少杀伤力吗  你该看一下
Did you ever see what it can do to a woman's pussy?

You should see what a .44 Magnum's gonna do to a woman's pussy.

562

What's that?

563
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,190
我知道你一定认为我...  你知道的

你一定觉得我是变态
You must think I'm pretty sick or something.

565
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,500
对吧  你一定觉得我很变态
Right? You must think I'm pretty sick?

566
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,190
对吧  我相信你觉得我是变态
Right? I bet you really think I'm sick, right?

567
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,750
你觉得我是变态吗
You think I'm sick?

568
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,460
你不必回答  我付钱雇你开车
You don't have to answer. I'm paying for the ride.

569
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,030
贝尔摩餐馆

570
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,390
我载了这个侏儒
I picked up this midget, you know.

571
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,150
他打扮得人模人样  穿着意大利制西装
He's very well-dressed, Italian suit...

572
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,780
长得很帅  带着一位高佻的金发美女
good-looking, with a beautiful bIonde.

573
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,540
-那女孩是侏儒   -不  那个男的是侏儒
- A lady midget? - No, the guy was a midget.

574
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,060
-那女孩是金发美女  -我懂了
- The blonde was a lady. - I got you.

575
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,310
那些侏儒很有趣
Those midgets are funny.

576
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,670
有时我想抱抱侏儒
Sometimes I like to hold a midget.

577
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,670
他们很有趣  老想坐在前座
They always want to sit in the front seat.

578
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,140
后来我载了两个同志  他们要去市区
Then I pick up these two fags. They're going downtown.

579
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,510
他们穿着莱茵石T恤  他们开始大叫吵架
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts. They start arguing and yelling.

580
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,710
另一个人说"你这个贱人"  他开始打他
The other one says, "You bitch," and starts beating him.

581
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,430
我说"我不在乎你们在家里"
I say, "I don't care what you do in the privacy...

582
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,980
"关上门后私下做了什么"
of your own home, behind closed doors."

583
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,910
"美国是个自由的国家"
This is America, a free country.

584
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,710
"我们得追求幸福  你们有权利  你们成年了"
We got a pursuit of happiness thing. You're consenting, you're adult.

585
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,510
"但是别在我的计程车里打架"
But, you know, in my fucking cab, don't go busting heads.

586
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,950
-"上帝爱你们  随你们开心"  -叫他们去加州吧
- Do what you want. - Tell them to go to California.

587
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,830
在加州同志分手还得付赡养费
In California, when two fags split up, one's got to pay the other alimony.

588
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,030
那还不错  那里很进步  你知道吗  我是说加州
Not bad. They're way ahead out there, you know? California.

589
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,150
所以我叫他们下车
So I tell them to get out.

590
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,990
有一次我看到警察  追着一个独腿男跑
One time, I saw a cop chase this guy with one leg.

591
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,350
-他拿着拐杖  -警察吗
- He was on crutches, you know. - The cop?

592
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,830
不  被警察追的家伙  该死的警察  他们什么都追
No, the dude he was chasing. Fucking cops, they chase anything.

593
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,510
-崔维斯  -你可以还我5块钱吗
You got that five you owe me?

594
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,910
他还真有钱  一大堆钞票
My man is Ioading, Ioading.

595
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,230
要不是在肯尼迪机场载了  来自俄亥俄州的家伙
I be broke if I hadn't caught me some people

596
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,790
我就破产了
from Ohio out at Kennedy.

597
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,560
我从长堤绕路送他们进曼哈顿
I took them into Manhattan by way of Long Beach,

598
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,870
他们给我五块钱小费
tipped me $5.

599
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,390
生意还好吗
How's the action around?

600
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,190
蛮冷清的
It's very sIow.

601
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,790
我要闪了
I'm shoving on.

602
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,310
威斯  等一下
Hey, Wiz, wait.

603
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,620
我能跟你谈一谈吗
Can I talk to you for a second?

604
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,590
再见  杀手
Bye, Killer.

605
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,510
谢谢你  晚安
Thank you, good night.

606
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,110
-你才要放下  -你爱怎么做都可以
- You can have them! - You get out or you what?

607
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,660
别打我的男人
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

608
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,000
你最好快滚  孩子
You better take your ass out, boy!

609
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,950
什么事
Yeah

610
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,630
我知道你跟我不常说话
I know you and I ain't talked too much, you know.

611
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,710
但我知道你很有见识  或许你可以...
But you've been around, so...

612
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,430
该死  那是大家叫我巫师的原因
Shoot, that's why they call me the Wizard.

613
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,910
我有...
I got...

614
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,630
问题是我有...
It's just that I got a...

615
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,070
你有心事
Things got you down?

616
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,340
对  即使是高手都会有低潮
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

617
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,070
对  我真的很烦
Yeah, they got me real down. Real...

618
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,150
我只想站出来
I just want to go out...

619
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,510
做一些事
and you know, really, really do something.

620
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,470
计程车人生  你知道吗
Taxi life, you mean?

621
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,030
对
Yeah

622
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,110

623
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,630
我不知道
I don't know.

624
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,990
我只想站出来
I just want to go out...

625
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,670

我有一些不好的念头  我只是...
I got some bad ideas in my head.

628
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,790
听着  就这么说吧
Look at it this way.

629
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,950
男人需要工作
A man takes a job.

630
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,070
工作...
And that job...

631
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,580
成了他的价值
you know, that becomes what he is.

632
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,710
你知道的  就像是...
You know, like...

633
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,870
你做了一件事  它成了你的代表
You do a thing, and that's what you are.

634
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,910
我开了17年计程车  10年时间在开夜班
I've been a cabbie for 17 years. Ten years at night.

635
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,990
我还是没有自己的计程车  为什么
And I still don't own my own cab. You know why?

636
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,950
因为我不想那么做  必须我想那么做才行
Because I don't want to. That must be what I want.

637
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,350
上夜班  开别人的计程车
To be on the night shift, driving somebody else's cab.

638
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,230
你懂吗
You understand?

639
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,230
你有了工作  成为工作的一部份
You get a job, you become the job.

640
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,980
有人住布鲁克林  有人住苏顿饭店
One guy lives in Brooklyn, one guy lives in Sutton PIace.

641
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,660
有人是律师  有人是医生

642
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,030
有人死了  有人活得很好
Another guy dies, another guy gets well...

643
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,030
有人出生

644
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,350
我羡慕你  你的年轻
I envy you, your youth.

645

你能出去泡妞  喝得烂醉  你爱做什么都可以
Go out and get Iaid. Get drunk. Do anything.

646
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,630
你没有选择  我们都完了
You got no choice, anyway. I mean, we're all fucked.

647
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,550
多多少少都是的  你知道吗
More or less, you know?

648
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,470
我不知道  那是我听过最蠢的事
I don't know. That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard of.

649
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,310
那不是罗素的名言  你想怎么样  我只是个计程车司机
It's not Bertrand Russell, but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

650
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,750
我又知道什么
What did I know

651
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,830
我甚至听不懂你在说什么
I don't even know what you're talking about.

652
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,350
或许我也不知道
Maybe I don't know either.

653
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,500
别那么忧心忡忡的
Don't worry so much.

654
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,230
放轻松  杀手  你会没事的
Relax, kid, you're gonna be all right.

655
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,350
我知道的  我见过很多人
I know. I've seen a lot of people...

656
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,750
-我知道  -好吧
- I know. - Kindly.

657
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,310
好吧  谢谢你
Okay. Thanks, man.

658
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,870
再见  我想是的
I guess, I guess.

659
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,270
对  你知道的  你一定会没事
Yeah, you know. You're all right.

660
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,750
你觉得在即将到来的初选中  你的对手机会有多大
What do you think of your opponent's chances in the upcoming primary?

661
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,550
古德曼先生是个好人
Mr. Goodman is a fine man.

662
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,110
我真的很希望  如果可以的话  他会是
I would certainly, if it came to it, prefer him...

663
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,900
敌对阵营的候选人
to our opponent in the other party.

664
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,740
我想我的政策比他好
I think that my programs are better defined than his.

665
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,670
他们的政策都是想像  我的胜选机率比较大
They're more imaginative. I have a better chance of winning.

666
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,710
这都只是猜想  他无法赢得初选  我会赢的
It's academic, though. He's not going to win. I am.

01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,390
我不是警察
I'm not a cop. I ain't a...

935
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,790
为什么你要那样子跟我说吗
Then why are you asking me for action?

936
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,390
她叫我来找你
Because she sent me over.

937
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,430
我想你袜子里没插着点38手枪
I suppose that ain't a .38 you got in your sock.

938
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,270
点38手枪
.38?

939
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,710
我没带枪
I'm clean, man.

940
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,630
-该死  你真的是牛仔   -对
- Shit, you're a real cowboy? - Yeah.

941
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,310
太棒了  好吧
That's nice, man. All right. That's all right.

942
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,270
15块是15分钟  半小时算你25块
15 dollars, 15 minutes. 25 dollars, half an hour.

943
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,430
该死
Shit.

944
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,020
牛仔
Cowboy, huh?

945
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,980
我曾养过一匹马  在科尼岛
I once had a horse. On Coney Island.

946
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,910
它被车撞了
She got hit by a car.

947
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,310
要不要随便你
Well, take it or leave it.

948
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,630
如果你想省点钱  别跟她做
If you wanna save yourself some money, don't fuck her.

949
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,630
因为你还会想回来
She'll be back for more.

950
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,670
她才12岁半  你一定没试过那样的女孩
She's 12 years old. You ain't never had no pussy like that.

951
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,590
爱做什么都可以  爬到她身上
Do anything you want. Come on her...

952
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,670
插在她的嘴里跟屁眼里  射满她一脸
fuck her in the mouth, in the ass. Come on her face.

953
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,270
她会让你的小弟弟变硬  让你爆炸
She'll get your cock so hard, she'll make it explode.

954
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,710
别来硬的  好吧
But no rough stuff. All right?

955
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,350
好吧  我要她
All right, I'll take it.

956
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,190
兄弟  别在这里付钱
Hey, man! Don't take out no money over here.

957
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,620
你要上我吗
You gonna fuck me?

958
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,870
你要上她  把钱交给她
You're gonna fuck her. You give her the money.

959
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,870
待会见  条子
Catch you Iater, copper.

960
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,390
-你说什么   -待会见  条子
What'd you say? See you Iater, copper.

961
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,870
我不是警察
I'm no cop, man.

962
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,510
如果你是警察  这一定是圈套
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.

963
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,860
我是嬉皮
I'm hip.

964
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,230
真有趣  你看起来不像嬉皮
Funny, you don't look hip.

965
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,710
去吧  让自己乐一下  快点
Have yourself a good time. Go ahead, man.

966
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,550
你是个有趣的家伙
You're a funny guy.

967
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,750
别被表面骗了
But looks aren't everything.

968
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,070
去吧  好好玩一场
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

969
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,270
你是个有趣的家伙
You're a funny guy.

970
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,990
嘿
Hey

971
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,430
房间是10块钱
The room'll cost you ten bucks.

972
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,310
我会帮你计时
I'm timing you too.

973
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,910

听着  先生  时间是你的  15分钟不久
Listen, mister, it's your time. 15 minutes ain't long.

976
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,670
香烟烧完后  你的时间也到了
When that cigarette burns out, your time is up.

977
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,310
你几岁
How old are you?

978
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,030
你不告诉我吗
You won't tell me?

979
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,580
-你叫什么名字   -简单

981
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,340
对  你叫什么名字
Yeah, but what's your real name?

982

What's wrong? It's a nice name.

986
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,430
只有你才那么想
That's what you think.

987
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:40,750
不  别那么做  你不记得我吗
No, don't do that. Don't you remember me?

988
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,070
还记得你搭上一辆计程车吗   一辆格纹计程车
Remember when you got into a taxi? It was a checkered taxi.

989
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,430
你上车  麦修冲过来
You got in and that guy Matthew came by...

是你跳上我的计程车  你想离开这里
You came into my cab. You wanted to get out of here.

1002

1014

我想我了解
I think I understand.

1015
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,030
我跳上你的计程车

听着  当时我喝多了
Look, I was stoned.

1020
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,510
所以他们拦下我
That's why they stopped me.

1021
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,190
不嗑药时  我没有别的地方可去
When I'm not stoned I got no pIace eIse to go.

1022
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,430

I mean, you know, regularly. This is nothing for a person to do.

1065
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,550
为了一个低级的皮条客
For some Iow-Iife pimp?

1066

他站在门廊边
Stands in a hall.

1067
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,110
我很死板  很死板的人应该是你
I'm square? You're the one that's square, man.

1068
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,710
我不会跟你一样  找杀人凶手跟毒虫上床
I don't go screw and fuck with killers and junkies like you.

1069
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,710
你说那是嬉皮生活
You call that being hip?

1070
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,390
你到底是从哪里来的
What world you from?

1071
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,390
-谁是杀人凶手   -小子是杀人凶手
- Who's a killer? - That guy Sport's a killer.

1072
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,070
小子没杀过人
Sport never killed nobody.

1073
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,750
-他杀了...  -他是天秤座
- He killed... - He's a Libra.

1074
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,100
什么
He's a what?

1075
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,710
我也是天秤座  所以我们处得很好
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.

1076
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,750
我觉得他看起来很像杀人凶手
He looks like a killer to me.

1077
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,630
我觉得巨蟹座是最棒的情人
I think that Cancers make the best lovers...

1078
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:24,070
我家人都是风象星座
but my whole family's air signs.

1079
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,470
他还是个毒虫
He's also a dope-shooter.

1080
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,630
为什么你高人一等   你能告诉我吗
What makes you so high and mighty? Will you tell me that?

1081
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:33,030
你看过镜子里的自己吗
Don't you ever look at your own eyeballs in the mirror?

1082
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,420
你怎么处理小子跟那个老头
What'll you do about Sport and that old guy?

1083
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,790
-什么时候   -你离开的时候
- When? - When you leave.

1084
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,630
我会直接离开
I'll just leave them.

1085
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,670
-直接离开   -他们会找到别的女孩
- Just leave? - They got other girls.

1086
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,790
你不能那么做  你打算怎么办
You can't just do that. What are you gonna do?

1087
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,110
你要我报警
Want me to call the cops?

1088
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,820
警察什么都不会做  你知道的
The cops don't do nothing. You know that.

1089
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:05,180
听着  小子没虐待过我  他没打过我
Sport never treated me bad. He didn't beat me up once.

1090
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:08,790
但你不能让他以同样的方法  对别的女孩
But you can't allow him to do the same to other girls.

1091
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,550
你不能让他那么做
You can't allow him to do that.

1092
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,950
他是最低级的人
He's the Iowest kind of person.

1093
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,150
得有人好好教训他
Somebody's got to do something to him.

1094
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,790
他是人渣
He's the scum of the earth.

1095
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,550
他是我见过
He's the worst...

1096
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,340
最低级的人渣
sucking scum I have ever, ever seen.

1097
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,510
你知道他怎么跟我说你的吗
You know what he told me about you?

1098
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,590
他骂你  他说你是鸡
He called you names. He called you a little piece of chicken.

1099
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,150
他不是真心的
He doesn't mean it.

1100
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,830
我要搬到佛蒙特的公社
I'll move up to one of them communes in Vermont.

1101
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,190
我没看过公社  我不知道
I never seen a commune before, but I don't know...

1102
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,510
我看过...
I saw...

1103
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,950
杂志上面的照片  看起来不是很干净
some photos once in a magazine. It didn't look very clean.

1104
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,430
你何不跟我一起去
Why don't you come with me?

1105
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,220
什么  跟你去公社  不
What? Come to the commune with you? No, no.

1106
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,870
有何不可
Why not?

1107
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,160
我不去那种地方
I don't go to pIaces like that.

1108
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,630
少来了  有何不可
Come on, why not?

1109
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,870
我无法那样子跟别人相处
I don't get along with people like that.

1110
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,730
-你是天座吗   -什么
- Are you a Scorpion? - What?

1111
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:18,870
没错  你是天座  每次我都能猜对
That's it. You're a Scorpion. I can tell every time.

1112
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,030
而且我得待在这里
Besides, I gotta stay here.

1113
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,320
少来了  为什么
Come on. Why?

1114
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,030
我有很重要的事要做
I got something important to do.

1115
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,830
什么事那么重要
So what's so important?

1116
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,910
我在为政府工作
Doing something for the government.

1117
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,060
开计程车是兼差
The cab thing is just part-time.

1118
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,710
你是缉毒组的吗
Are you a narc?

1119
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,350
我看起来像缉毒组的吗
Do I look like a narc?

1120
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,910
对
Yeah.

1121
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,350
我是缉毒组的
I am a narc.

1122
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,910
天啊  我不知道你跟我  到底谁比较奇怪
God! I don't know who's weirder, you or me.

1123
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:00,230
-你真的不跟我走   -我会给你旅费
- Sure you don't wanna come with me? - I'll give you the money to go.

1124
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,470
-你不必那么做  -我要你收下钱
- You don't have to. - I want you to take it.

我不要你拿他们的钱
I don't want you to take anything from them.

1126
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,510
我要这么做
And I wanna do it.

1127
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,260
反正我有钱没地方花
I don't have anything better to do with my money.

1128
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,430
我得离开一阵子
I might be going away for a while.

1129
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,470
你只是有点紧张
You're just a little tense, that's all.

1130
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,150
我不喜欢这么做  小子
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

1131
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,430
宝贝  我不要你喜欢你做的事
Baby, I never wanted you to like what you're doing.

1132
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,550
如果你喜欢你在做什么事  你就不是我的女人
If you ever liked what you were doing, you wouldn't be my woman.

1133
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,780
你不再花时间陪我
You never spend any time with me anymore.

1134
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,070
我忙着做生意  宝贝

我也不喜欢离开你
I don't like to be away from you either.

1137

你知道我对你的感觉

1138

我依靠你

没有你  我会失去方向
I'd be lost without you.

1140

I only wish every man could know what it's like to be loved by you.

1146
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,230
每个女人
That every woman, everywhere...

1147
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,070
都有个男人爱她  就跟我爱你一样
had a man who loves her like I love you.

1148
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,310
天啊  能抱着你感觉真棒
God, it's good so close.

1149
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,270
有时候在这样的情况下
You know, at times like this...

1150

我知道我是个幸运儿

It's only you that keeps me together.

1153

亲爱的艾瑞丝  这笔钱应该够你离开了

1154
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,670
你看到这封信时  我已经死了  崔维斯

1155
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,030
现在我明白了  我的一生
Now I see it clearly. My whole life is pointed...

1156
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,510
只为了一件事活着  现在我懂了
in one direction. I see that now.

1157
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,030

1165

这里不是普通的地方

1166
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:49,750
许多道路  许多人的性命在这里交会

今天我们在这里见面再适合不过

我们来到历史的十字路口
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1170
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,950
我们是人民

1171
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,790
我们在错误的道路上走了太久
For far too long, the wrong roads have been taken.

1172
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,270
错误的道路带我们走向战争跟贫穷
The wrong roads have Ied us into war, into poverty...

1173
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,390

No longer will we, the people, suffer for the few.

1176
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:38,430
如果我说新道路会一帆风顺  我是在说谎
I would Iie to you if I told you the new roads would be easy.

1177
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,150
那一点都不简单
They will not be easy.

1178
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,950
正确的决定从来都不简单
Nothing that is right and good has ever been easy.

1179
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,150
人民知道这一点
We, the people, know that.

1180
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:55,390
人们知道正确的道路
And we, the people, know the right roads and the good.

Today I say to you, we are the people, you and I.

1189
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,390
给他一些空间  好吗

1193
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,070
拿到钱了吗
Got the money?

1194
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,420
艾瑞丝在房里
Iris in her room?

1195
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,110
好吧
OK

1196
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,790
小子  你好吗

- Where do I know you from, man? - I don't know.

1199
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,980
拉皮条生意不错吧

听说你没事  病情有所好转

1230
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:18,030
我们到纽约接艾瑞丝时
We tried to visit you at the hospital...

1231
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:20,950
试着到医院看你
when we were in New York to pick up Iris...

1232
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,800
那时你还在昏迷中

1233
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,110
我们无法报答你
There is no way we can repay you...

1234
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,470
帮我们找回艾瑞丝

我们以为我们失去她了

现在我们的生活恢复正常

你是这个家的英雄
you are something of a hero around this household.

1239
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:45,590
我相信你会想知道艾瑞丝的近况
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.

1240
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:49,310
她回到学校  非常用功
She's back in school and working hard.

1241
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:52,630
调整生活脚步对她来说很难

1242
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,150
你应该想像得到

1245

不希望她再逃家

1246
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,630
简单地来说

1247
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:07,590
史提恩斯马太太跟我打从心里

1249
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:14,790
不幸地我们没钱再到纽约
Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again...

1250
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,950
亲自感谢你  不然我们一定会那么做
to thank you in person, or we surely would.

1251
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,030

Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up and says, "I want to swap tires."

1255

我说"这是新轮胎"
I say, "These are new tires.

1256
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,710
"为什么你不丢掉别的东西   譬如说你太太"
Why not throw in something else, like your wife?"

1257
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:45,100
他太太是1957年纽泽西小姐
She was Miss New Jersey, 1957.

1258
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:46,990
所以车行没有备胎
That's why the fleet has no spares.

1259
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:49,630
面团男孩  巫师  杀手

真的没什么  我已经挺过来了
It was nothing, really. I got over that.

1272
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,470
媒体就是喜欢夸大
Papers always blow these things up.

1273
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:30,590
我只是受了一点小伤
Just a little stiffness. That's all.

1274
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,830
崔维斯
Travis...

1275
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,750
