1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,678
i've always felt that uh

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:05,839
that uh it'd be wonderful if i could

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,120
shoot a film the way i see things

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,480
literally the way i see things as i'm

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,599
walking around

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,519
and i'm happy to move very quickly i

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,679
walk fast and i talk fast

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,399
and i see things quickly i think and

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,559
i've tried to

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,760
formulate it into a style and it is like

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,399
it is literally like taking the eye uh

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,118
the heads of the

13
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:26,239
the people in the audience and grabbing

14
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,760
them by the back of their hair and

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,439
forcing them to see things

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,278
uh by different cuts and camera moves

17
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:32,880
the way i see them or

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,799
the way i get impressions that i see

19
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,079
them they're really impressions of what

20
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,799
i see

21
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,960
and movement i'm really annoyed that i

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,878
can never really get

23
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,200
certain camera moves fast enough i'm

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,320
trying to capture the way i

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,359
the way i perceive things uh i use word

26
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,960
perceive rather than see because

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
i could see something but i'll remember

28
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,399
it in some sort of

29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,238
maybe in a different perception maybe a

30
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:56,079
different image or

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,520
it'll be it expressed another way and uh

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,759
it'll be as if the camera zoomed in or

33
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,198
it'd be as if the camera tracked from

34
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:04,799
left to right parallel

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,920
you know but actually i was moving

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,879
another way but that's the way i

37
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,239
remember it and i try to get those

38
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,799
images in my mind those impressions

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,280
through moves camera moves or cuts

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,478
actually through cuts that's even more

41
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:15,519
fun

42
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,280
and i just like to enjoy it that's all i

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,519
like to enjoy when i make a picture

44
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,759
director martin scorsese reached one of

45
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,438
the pinnacles of his career

46
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:25,200
and the high point in his collaboration

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
with writer paul schrader

48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,359
in taxi driver as you watch the movie

49
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,719
the director and writer

50
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,438
talk about the story its genesis and the

51
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:35,200
production of the film

52
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
and i remember the steam had to come up

53
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
this way in the beginning of this shot

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,478
so he sort of comes out of hell in a way

55
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:42,879
a character and the camera tracks in the

56
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,680
door

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
this was the first day of shooting

58
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,319
writer paul schrader i wrote tacky

59
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,599
driver both drafts

60
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,239
in 10 days was quite extraordinary i

61
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,200
wish i could go back to that

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,560
it sort of sprang from my head like an

63
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
animal

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,959
and it was a result of

65
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,000
of of some hard

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
times i was having psychologically

67
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,719
and uh i had

68
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,318
broken up with my wife and i had left

69
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,239
the afr and i didn't really have any

70
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
direction to my career

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,318
and i was not making much money as a

72
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:27,280
critic

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,120
and i fell into a period of depression

74
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,439
where i was basically living in my car

75
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,639
you know and driving around and uh

76
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,239
and uh i started uh getting a pain in my

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,159
stomach and so i went to

78
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,199
emergency ward at the hospital

79
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,800
and while i was there i realized that i

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
hadn't talked to anyone in almost

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,719
three weeks and then i had just been

82
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,159
living alone

83
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,360
you know at night and going to

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,400
pornography and living in myself

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,080
and then it turned out i had a ulcerous

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,639
condition

87
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,039
in my stomach and so while i was

88
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,039
recuperating

89
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,719
uh it occurred to me that what i had

90
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,800
become was like a taxi driver

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
a man who was locked in this iron coffin

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,639
wandering around

93
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,840
in this nightmarish world that he was

94
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,639
inventing

95
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,560
and you know as soon as that metaphor

96
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,000
occurred to me

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,039
then it was relatively simple to find a

98
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,158
plot

99
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,799
that would adhere to the psychological

100
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,840
reality

101
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,759
you know and the psychological reality

102
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,959
is that this person

103
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,158
is creating the nightmare he is not

104
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,439
subject to it uh so therefore you have a

105
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,639
situation where

106
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,598
the girl he desires he cannot have the

107
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,560
one

108
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,598
he can have he cannot desire so he tries

109
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,120
to kill the father figure of one and

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,719
when he fails he kills the father figure

111
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,840
of the other

112
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
and in his mind it was all the same the

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
fact that one's a politician one is a

114
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,759
pimp really doesn't make much difference

115
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,120
he's strictly dealing with father

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,039
figures and the irony being then of

117
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,120
course that

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
society assigns him the role of a hero

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,400
because he

120
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,759
got lucky and killed the right one

121
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,000
i remember this on 57th street

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,279
uh borrowing that dissolve effect from

123
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,519
george stevens's film shane

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,000
it's a scene where jack plants walks

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
into the bar

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,360
the cameras are very low angle and

127
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
he approaches towards the camera and

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
then dissolves to a much tighter shot of

129
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,680
his

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,199
boots as they go past the frame i always

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,720
found it to be fascinating i used it

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,360
there

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,399
this was a set that we built

134
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,839
in an abandoned building on

135
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,758
off 89th street around columbus avenue

136
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,079
paul schrader you know i think that uh

137
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,399
if you can find a theme you know and

138
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,000
find a metaphor which expresses the

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
theme so if the theme in this case is

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,519
loneliness

141
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,360
and the met perfect metaphor for it then

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,600
is the the taxi cab and the taxi cab

143
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
driver

144
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,319
and then you just take that theme and

145
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,399
you run it through your metaphor and

146
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,079
come out with a plot

147
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,680
which expresses the theme

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
then as you do that you learn a lot more

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,038
about the theme

150
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,199
you learn that theme wasn't in fact

151
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,038
loneliness the theme was

152
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,600
self-imposed holiness paul schrader's

153
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,079
strict

154
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,240
calvinist upbringing precluded him from

155
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
exposure to worldly entertainment

156
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,399
and as a result he never saw a movie

157
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,240
until his late teens

158
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,160
when schroeder finally discovered film

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,360
his enthusiasm

160
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,759
led him to study at ucla where he

161
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,000
zealously watched several movies a week

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,639
and wrote his master's thesis entitled

163
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,879
transcendental style in film

164
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,240
ozu bresson dreyer his first

165
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,399
screenwriting credit was for the yakuza

166
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,360
in 1975 and he went on to write taxi

167
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,918
driver

168
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,639
and brian de palma's obsession paul

169
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,720
schrader made his directorial debut in

170
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,879
1978 with blue collar

171
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,800
and most recently wrote the script for

172
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
martin scorsese's the last temptation of

173
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,840
christ

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,879
martin scorsese this is pete savage uh

175
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,160
playing this part in the back pete

176
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,879
savage was uh the co-writer of raging

177
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,319
bold book

178
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,199
with the guy named joseph carter and he

179
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,839
was uh

180
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,279
the film was produced in association

181
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,519
with uh pete savage

182
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,079
unfortunately i think after the after oh

183
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,000
after the film opened

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,560
he died

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,038
about five six months after the film

186
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:37,038
opened but he does a little cameo for us

187
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,759
in this in this film

188
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,879
this is something that wasn't scripted

189
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,120
again but if you're new york in the

190
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,999
summer you have to have

191
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
the pumps open

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,519
again trying as much as possible not to

193
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,839
give a uh

194
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,038
a steady visual narrative to it rather

195
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,560
jump cutting for example when he when

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
there was a couple of cuts back there

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
which you just saw that

198
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,879
and uh that was the shot that eventually

199
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,560
became the uh the poster

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
which did very well that poster sold the

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
picture great uh

202
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,639
much much better than i had expected

203
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,360
this is actually

204
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,038
one of those uh uh 60 mm porno places on

205
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,240
8th avenue i don't know if i don't think

206
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,079
it exists anymore there

207
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,160
that's diane abbott can i help you

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,439
yeah but we tried to not keep

209
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,598
the cutting of the film in straight

210
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:28,959
narrative uh

211
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,959
the visual images after after he gets

212
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,319
out of the cab up earlier

213
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,399
he takes the uh takes the rag in his

214
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,918
hand then it jump cuts and he's cleaning

215
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,279
up the back seat

216
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,240
and that was the idea to try to keep

217
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,439
disorienting the

218
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,560
sense of anxiety and and uh

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
uneasiness that we wanted to give the

220
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,839
audience

221
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,598
because as i've said many times we did

222
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:50,879
not think i didn't think that this

223
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,079
picture was gonna make any money

224
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,598
this was done as a labor of love for

225
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,560
about a million three i think in 1975

226
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,319
the summer of 75

227
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,160
and uh uh towards the end bob felt

228
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
it would do very well and so did michael

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,759
and julia phillips who were producing it

230
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,918
but um we just did as a labor of love

231
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,038
and we had some trouble shooting this

232
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,720
stuff because it was actual pornographic

233
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,439
film

234
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,839
and we had to oil out the image as you

235
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,120
can see there

236
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,439
it's an optical of course the rushes

237
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,800
didn't have that optical and

238
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,918
and uh it was difficult sending that

239
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,240
stuff to the studio in los angeles

240
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,360
if they didn't have a sense of humor

241
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,479
about it but it worked out all right

242
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,080
again all these shots are scripted all

243
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,839
these moves have been thought of way

244
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,200
beforehand otherwise there's no way to

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,918
do this picture

246
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,958
for million three in 1975 uh in eight or

247
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,000
nine weeks

248
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
shooting eight weeks shooting mainly at

249
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
night

250
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
now this is pretty much taken i think

251
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
directly from godard

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,278
that kind of a move i always enjoy that

253
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:52,639
kind of stuff i think that was at the

254
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,559
end of my favorite goddard film contempt

255
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,399
in which you see a letter read like that

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,600
and you see the the

257
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,240
you see the writing come up in that way

258
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,679
paul schrader

259
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,480
the script did not have much humor in it

260
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,200
and

261
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,080
marty very wisely put that in he casts

262
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,879
albert

263
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,639
brooks and cats comedian in essentially

264
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,000
a straight role so that turned into a

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
comic role

266
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,639
uh the kind of small talk between the

267
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,759
cabbies

268
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,360
you know he sort of elaborated to give

269
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
the film a little more comic relief

270
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,839
which i think was very smart casting

271
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,159
betsy the initial object of travis's

272
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,958
obsession

273
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,240
martin scorsese chose sybil shepard

274
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,759
so mengers at the time was representing

275
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,679
her and she suggested and she came to

276
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,639
see me at

277
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,919
the hotel and i liked her

278
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,919
i really liked it we'd we had gone

279
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,480
through uh lots of young actresses

280
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,679
uh with tests

281
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,080
video screen tests and things like that

282
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,879
but

283
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,440
when she arrived she had glasses on and

284
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,159
uh

285
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,759
remember she couldn't take her glasses

286
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,278
off because she she was too nearsighted

287
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:58,320
or far sided i thought that was very

288
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,278
funny

289
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,200
we try to use that in the film a little

290
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,799
bit from here and here and there

291
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,120
and i like the look the idea of

292
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,679
the blonde woman uh

293
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,559
something that he could never aspire he

294
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,839
can never get he can aspire to but he

295
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,958
can never get because of where he comes

296
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,000
from or what the type of person he is

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
this uh what do you call it uh

298
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
i guess very much the white anglo-saxon

299
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
protestant

300
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,278
uh american you know

301
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:33,200
maybe has a wealthy family and this sort

302
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,639
of thing and

303
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,599
um he um

304
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
who knows what his background is but it

305
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,759
certainly isn't that

306
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,440
yeah and and i think that was

307
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,639
important uh i don't say he even loves

308
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,120
her it's a matter of the obsession

309
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
she becomes an object and that's

310
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
important

311
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,200
this shot was inspired by michael

312
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,159
powell's and press burgers uh

313
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,919
credit sequence for the small back room

314
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,278
a black and white film

315
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:05,759
in which the opening sequences have um

316
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,639
have um

317
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,399
uh shot through windshields and you see

318
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,759
the um

319
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,399
uh changing of lights uh traffic lights

320
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,838
and i was that was fascinating

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
and again all these inserts were also

322
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,078
drawn so that when i sent david nichols

323
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,600
out to get stuff like this he knew

324
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,159
pretty much

325
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,278
what he was getting what he was supposed

326
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,519
to get the first passenger he picked up

327
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,639
was actually played by my mother but we

328
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,078
cut her out

329
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,240
not for anything that she did we gave

330
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
her shopping bags and everything but

331
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
it just seemed that uh we didn't need it

332
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,639
and we had to get these these moments

333
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,519
that were scripted of

334
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,958
couples looking as if they're in love in

335
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,958
the street and he's noticing etc

336
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,200
when i read the script i thought that's

337
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,399
the kind of film i should be making

338
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,360
because

339
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,240
um it had an honesty to it and a

340
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
truthfulness about it

341
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,278
what that truth is i mean i can't

342
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,440
verbalize otherwise i you know

343
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,200
paul was able to verbalize it and that's

344
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,559
why i put it on paper but i

345
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,200
had to put it through pictures right so

346
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,559
i thought that's the kind of picture

347
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,639
that should be coming out of america

348
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,078
that should be coming out of hollywood

349
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:08,000
specifically and it did we only shot the

350
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
film in new york we made the film in

351
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,639
hollywood

352
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,759
all my films at that time i made in

353
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,240
hollywood really even mean streets was

354
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,679
only five days shooting a six day

355
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,120
shooting in new york the rest was faked

356
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
in los angeles and completely cut in

357
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
hollywood

358
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,839
so a really american movie and um you

359
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,039
know at that time i feel that the kind

360
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,360
of

361
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,519
kind of things that the screen the

362
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,200
american screen should should really

363
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,078
i don't know should really be tackling

364
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:33,200
that subject matter

365
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,759
i felt that don't forget i made mean

366
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,399
streets

367
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,078
and then i made a studio film alice's

368
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,440
livery anymore

369
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,639
and then i was about to do new york new

370
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,759
york which was another kind of studio

371
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,720
film hollywood

372
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,159
in a sense it began as an entertainment

373
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,039
film it didn't wind up as an

374
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,799
entertainment film new york new york

375
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,200
so that uh when taxi driver came by i

376
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,399
realized

377
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,320
no um uh it was kind of the beginning of

378
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,120
my career

379
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,639
in hollywood and i i had to choose

380
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,240
between whether i was going to make

381
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,440
hollywood type pictures or or

382
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,319
more personal movies

383
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:06,480
and that's what i felt that i should do

384
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,919
it because i had to keep on trying to

385
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,120
make as many personal pictures as

386
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,839
possible within the system

387
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,120
within the hollywood system because it

388
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,639
doesn't matter where you live in america

389
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,078
uh

390
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:17,200
if you make a film in new york or

391
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
chicago or whatever it's still a

392
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
hollywood film

393
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,399
the industry is la los angeles

394
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,120
i always tried to shoot bob in a single

395
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,799
frame

396
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,278
on his shot however when you take other

397
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:30,799
people we try to shoot past him and

398
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,879
include him in their frames

399
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,000
so that we always try to kind of

400
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,639
psychologically that way see he's in

401
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,000
this one this is one features harry

402
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,278
north up here in the middle and he's in

403
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,919
the frame also

404
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,159
we try to keep him separate from

405
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,360
everybody else even

406
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,440
we thought that maybe i thought that

407
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,720
maybe that would that would

408
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
give the impression of him his

409
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
separateness from other people

410
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,600
psychologically uh sort of a subtext you

411
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
keep it in your mind that way

412
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,159
oh this is a shot i always have fun with

413
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,360
i always liked that scene and

414
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,919
one or two things i know about her a

415
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,120
goddard picture in which

416
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,440
she looks at a coffee cup and uh he kind

417
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,958
of moves into the

418
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,039
top of the cup and into the coffee and

419
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,198
uh the bubbles in the coffee uh get the

420
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:16,240
impression of um

421
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
space a milky way almost

422
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,198
uh i guess it's new york this is a new

423
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:23,678
york version

424
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,399
the picture behind bob actually that's

425
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:26,958
of um

426
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,480
pete scopo who was our assistant

427
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,799
director who's a very very

428
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,000
quite an excellent assistant director

429
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,559
here in new york films he became the uh

430
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,879
the image of the other uh uh the other

431
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,000
candidate

432
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,120
again these scenes i think this scene

433
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
was improv too and we worked on it

434
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,799
he just don't the improv that we we

435
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,958
tried to do and i usually do it this way

436
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,958
is is that we don't you know make them

437
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,480
up on the spot i mean basically it's

438
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,639
uh worked out in advance and rehearsal

439
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,679
and rewritten

440
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,039
and studied um in that way again because

441
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,639
of the type of shooting schedule i was

442
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,600
dealing with

443
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
uh basically i can only get what i had

444
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,360
planned

445
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,879
bob is an actor um again in taxi driver

446
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,000
you see us just

447
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,879
feeling each other out in a way the

448
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,320
scene with the

449
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,879
secret service man uh in which he's

450
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,799
giving him his name as henry crinkle

451
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,278
gives you an idea of the kind of kind of

452
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:18,480
uh

453
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,039
comfort we had with each other he put a

454
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,958
line in or a look or a body gesture and

455
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,519
i

456
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,759
i felt that uh he really understood the

457
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,039
character and

458
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,039
if anything would happen if the if the

459
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,240
uh the

460
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,919
campaign platform behind him blew up

461
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,278
he'd still go on or whatever he'd do

462
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:33,839
would be

463
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
would be natural within character i

464
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,519
always felt that and therefore i had

465
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,720
that trust with him

466
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,159
and we're always able kind of to to uh

467
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,559
we felt pretty similar about very many

468
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,919
things

469
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,720
about life and uh again you just see us

470
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,839
feeling it out here i think

471
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,759
finally we reached a good the best

472
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,000
collaboration was a raging bull

473
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,078
where we worked very closely together on

474
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,039
that

475
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,198
but i i knew that i had a good sense

476
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:00,799
with him in mean streets

477
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,480
because we only shot 26 days there so it

478
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
was very quick but here we shot longer

479
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,399
and i really felt good about him here i

480
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,720
felt that uh

481
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,639
we understood each other it was almost

482
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,639
like sign language between each other

483
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,000
again people always talked about the

484
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,839
idea of travis bickle being so

485
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,360
unsympathetic a character and yet it

486
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,198
acted like de niro especially in a scene

487
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:20,078
like this

488
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,519
it gives you an idea of uh sympathetic

489
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,320
nature

490
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
bob has as a person and somehow i think

491
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
that translates

492
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,559
coming up as an overhead shot too on the

493
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,679
desk

494
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,480
that uh there was an earlier one when he

495
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,879
accepted the papers off uh from the uh

496
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,240
from the uh fellow who was giving him

497
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,159
the job and the taxi stand

498
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,000
um and these were sort of like

499
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
religious sort of like looking down

500
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
on a serving of a mass of some sort

501
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,799
where you see the ritual

502
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,359
and um

503
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,480
this business right here and the idea

504
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,720
uh later on that's that's also shown

505
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,919
when they're laying out the guns when he

506
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,039
buys the guns

507
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,880
and it says to do with with the the

508
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,119
drive of of uh

509
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,919
of this character and how his almost

510
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:10,400
zealot

511
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,959
nature you know how he is uh

512
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,078
how he is

513
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,679
driven to cleanse the world

514
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,240
in his quest to purify travis feels the

515
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,679
need to attach himself

516
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,240
to a woman the embodiment of goodness

517
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,319
and beauty

518
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,960
not quite sure why he obsesses with both

519
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,440
well he

520
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
one he can't he can't eat one he tries

521
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,079
and he can't get near and the other one

522
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,279
who has similarities to uh betsy

523
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,000
the smaller one uh is blonde also but

524
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,679
she's been

525
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,919
degraded you know she works in the

526
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,038
streets and

527
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:51,519
so he's going to save her he's going to

528
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,720
be the

529
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,279
he's going to be the saint he's going to

530
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:55,919
save her

531
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,400
you know he's going to come in and

532
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,359
rescue her

533
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,558
of course she doesn't want to be rescued

534
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,119
but it doesn't matter to him

535
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,038
but um he goes from one

536
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,480
he goes from the it's they're pretty

537
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,558
much the same image only one is the

538
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:12,240
one is on a pedestal and the other has

539
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,679
been degraded and he's going to

540
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,279
save that one that's degraded that's the

541
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,599
idea paul schrader

542
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,400
it's madonna horror syndrome you know

543
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,880
and

544
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
he wants to make the madonna into a horn

545
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,599
he wants to make the [ __ ] into a

546
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,480
madonna

547
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,119
it's it's a totally self-destructive uh

548
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,160
psychological

549
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,720
mechanism he's set up he set up the

550
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,679
terms

551
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,720
of romance so that he will fail again

552
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,960
because i wanted to shoot this scene

553
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,798
against columbus circle so we'd see the

554
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,240
life we see the city the city is like

555
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,599
really a character in this movie too you

556
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,558
know

557
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,319
i had a real problem uh real problem

558
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,240
because it kept raining on and off

559
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,759
during the day and things wouldn't match

560
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,200
when i wanted to get a medium shot of

561
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,679
her against the window medium shadow bob

562
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,599
and this is when we had difficulty with

563
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,038
the studio they were forcing trying to

564
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,240
force me to

565
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,599
to continue shooting put her against the

566
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,119
white wall and shoot now i could have

567
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,200
just moved the camera

568
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
accordingly and just gotten them against

569
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,839
the white wall but i thought i didn't

570
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,679
think it was right and i had to

571
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,400
i remember it being a real problem um

572
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,839
with the studio trying to get me to

573
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,440
continue shooting on a

574
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,960
steady basis so we have to keep breaking

575
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,798
up the scene and coming back to it

576
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:17,759
and that's a problem when you have to

577
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,319
switch locations but

578
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,119
it was kind of a uh i think it was the

579
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,000
second week of shooting

580
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,720
and uh it was a major confrontation

581
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,000
about it

582
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,960
writer paul schrader i mean i wrote the

583
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,558
script essentially for myself

584
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,919
as as therapy and so

585
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,759
uh it was something i was surprised the

586
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,200
degree to which

587
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,798
a large number of people plugged into

588
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,400
my own uh neurosis

589
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,319
bordering in the in the case of this

590
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,038
character on psychosis

591
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,160
uh so obviously there was something

592
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,880
about

593
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
what i was going through at that time

594
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,558
that was far more generalized

595
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:00,640
than i imagined i have such a beautiful

596
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,599
script it was

597
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,400
it was uh there's only i think two

598
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
scripts i've ever gotten

599
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,798
in the film since i've been making films

600
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:09,519
that

601
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,440
we've hardly done anything with they

602
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,119
were like completely there as we got

603
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,038
them was taxi driver was the first one

604
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:16,720
and then later on was king of comedy by

605
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,558
paul zimmerman but this uh

606
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:20,400
was the very first one where you all bob

607
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,159
and myself and

608
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,159
felt as if it had been written for us in

609
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,159
a funny way

610
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,359
taxi driver was very much a serendipity

611
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,279
you know

612
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,440
three people coming together at a

613
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
certain point in their lives

614
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,799
all needing to say the same thing

615
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,200
you know occasionally in in art you get

616
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,000
lucky

617
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,359
and you're at the right place at the

618
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,119
right time with the right people

619
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,960
and i think that was the case with taxi

620
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,519
driver and i think that uh

621
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,240
marty's highly frenetic cutting against

622
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,319
the grain urbanized style

623
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,440
was a wonderful counterpoint to

624
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
the sort of protestant reserve

625
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,038
and inhibition of the character in the

626
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:06,558
screenplay

627
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:07,679
paul always felt it was important that

628
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,519
he never knew anybody he didn't know any

629
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,960
celebrities he was completely in his own

630
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,679
world

631
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,798
the movies he would go and see would be

632
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:15,119
the porno movies and he had no sense of

633
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,319
of uh fitting in with people he says you

634
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,599
know i have to live a

635
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,759
a pure life and he's popping pills my

636
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,519
favorite line in the script is he says

637
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:23,919
you know

638
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,038
uh a person should not live a life of

639
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:28,960
morbid self-attention

640
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
that's all he does is live a life of

641
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
more of itself attention

642
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
uh he uh you know

643
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,960
he despises the uh

644
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
sort of gutter world of pornography yet

645
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,279
that's what he goes and sees

646
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,480
it is um you know

647
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,159
uh it's a life it is

648
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,400
essentially a contradictory life that

649
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
has to resolve itself

650
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,599
and and in the uneducated world of this

651
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,079
character

652
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,880
it resolves itself in the very american

653
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,079
way of of

654
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,839
taking the gun and attacking someone

655
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,359
else

656
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,079
you know in another culture he might

657
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:08,798
have

658
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:11,759
taken it out on himself you know let's

659
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,240
say

660
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,038
you know in france or japan but in

661
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:17,359
america we tend to

662
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,440
you know act out these dramas on someone

663
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,400
else's stage rather than our own

664
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,519
director martin scorsese

665
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,119
i think he puts himself in like in a

666
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,038
catholic in a catholic frame let's in a

667
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:30,079
catholic reference you would say the

668
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,519
occasion of sin

669
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,038
he put your he puts himself in those

670
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:35,599
areas which aggravates him the most

671
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,960
later on that shows up let's say in

672
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,319
raging bull where jake gets the most

673
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,759
beautiful woman to marry

674
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,279
thomas make himself miserable because he

675
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,558
knows that men are going to look at her

676
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:45,440
and that she's going to look

677
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,640
naturally as human beings she may look

678
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,880
back god forbid so

679
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,798
so it's the same kind of thinking i

680
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:52,159
think that's what i think

681
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,599
but i do know that in a sense he puts

682
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,279
himself in those areas

683
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,519
he puts himself right in the hell why

684
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,440
would he want to drive a cab at night

685
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,000
in new york you know not all of new york

686
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,440
is that way as we say even today it's

687
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,798
not all this way but

688
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:06,798
it is anybody who's lived in the city an

689
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:08,319
urban and urban

690
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,759
environment or new york especially

691
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,359
knows that certain areas certain times

692
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,640
of the day or night you don't go in

693
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,679
certain places and

694
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,679
you'd be very very careful how you

695
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,519
travel and you know especially now with

696
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,558
the

697
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:21,599
amount of drugs in the street and that

698
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,558
sort of thing people are out there and

699
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:23,839
they're desperate

700
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,279
they're desperate but he puts himself

701
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,599
right in the war zone

702
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,000
and he's upset about it and the more

703
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,480
he's upset by it the more he stays in it

704
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,440
if you look at the first scene he says

705
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,400
where would you go when you go up to

706
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,519
harlem when you go here when you go

707
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,000
there

708
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,519
he says i'll go anywhere now why

709
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,359
and you know they say well he's a

710
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,200
vietnam vet and he's been damaged

711
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,278
his brain has been damaged his emotions

712
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:47,038
are he's emotionally distraught from

713
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,480
vietnam well that's that's a uh

714
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,558
that's just you know a lot of guys came

715
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:53,679
back and went that way a lot of guys

716
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,880
come back and we're disturbed what can

717
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,839
we say it's just

718
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,200
not commenting on the vietnam vets

719
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
commenting on the idea of of um

720
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,759
literally this idea of a person is

721
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,278
repulsed by this sort of thing so much

722
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,759
and yet surrounds himself with it so

723
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,038
that he could torture himself with it i

724
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:09,599
think

725
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,599
you know and then eventually act out on

726
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,119
it against it

727
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,159
and really he's acting out on those

728
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,880
things inside himself you know

729
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,000
he's certainly not cured by the end of

730
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,119
the picture that's for sure that's how i

731
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,558
was i always tried that thing at the end

732
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,079
a little flip in the mirror to show that

733
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,839
he uh it's just the time while i'm

734
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,278
ticking away again starts all over again

735
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:25,919
i don't know if

736
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,400
that's that clear at the end but that's

737
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,558
all right it doesn't have to be

738
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:33,278
now the moves for travis's paranoia

739
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:35,119
camera moves

740
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,839
are in direct line with the tradition of

741
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,359
the horror film

742
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,240
the moves by camera moves by mario bava

743
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,319
and italian films in the 60s

744
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,119
uh to mark robeson isle of the dead or

745
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,319
jacques turner

746
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,359
in the cat people

747
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,558
any of the valuetainment pictures you

748
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,919
know um or other wonderful uh

749
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,480
literally you keep thinking of the woman

750
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,519
in a nightgown

751
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,159
walking through the halls of a gothic

752
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,278
castle

753
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,720
with the candelabra walking walking

754
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,919
about to open the door don't open the

755
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,200
door don't go in that door she goes in

756
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,240
she shouldn't go in you know she

757
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,919
shouldn't do it but she doesn't you want

758
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,440
her to do it but you hate you yelling me

759
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
as the audience member don't do it don't

760
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,519
do it

761
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,400
that's where all of those angle a lot of

762
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,759
those moves come

763
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,960
come from um from that not did you sit

764
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,278
down

765
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:25,278
not that you sit down and say hey let's

766
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:26,720
do the moves from a horror film

767
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,079
but you they they

768
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,679
somehow from my subconscious they're

769
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,480
interpreted that way on paper

770
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,599
it has the same kind of dread and that i

771
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,640
was hoping to communicate to the

772
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,359
audience

773
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,000
the same kind of dread the same kind of

774
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
move when his eyes look a certain way

775
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,599
that you know what powell used so much

776
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,919
in in tales of hoffman

777
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,278
where you have ballet moves and things

778
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:51,200
like that and yet it has in the film

779
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,319
tales of hoffman you have

780
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,319
you have a sense of almost like a

781
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,480
wonderful horror operetta

782
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,079
you know it's very strange especially

783
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,079
the venice sequence

784
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,440
and you'll have it also in red shoes the

785
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,679
red shoes ballet

786
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,359
the richest ballet and just shots of

787
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,640
anton wahlberg sitting there listening

788
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,079
or looking

789
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,240
i mean he doesn't have to move on those

790
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,919
it's the framing the way uh

791
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,240
the way he's positioned in the frame and

792
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,839
it's the amount of cuts

793
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,798
you know and so all that's kind of i

794
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:20,798
guess i've seen a lot of films

795
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,798
and all that has has filtered through

796
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:26,000
i believe this was this is one of the

797
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
shots i was talking about earlier kind

798
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
of

799
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,240
sense again of anxiety we're tilting

800
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
and i remember very difficult shot

801
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,159
actually to get tilting back down then

802
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,679
he grabs it and he takes it goes puts it

803
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,079
in his pocket then up and out

804
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,278
it looks very simple but actually it's

805
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:43,999
very hard to operate

806
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,798
through camera moves and angles scorsese

807
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:48,960
and cinematographer michael chapman

808
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,119
highlighted travis's volatile nature and

809
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,240
taxi driver

810
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,400
the first in a series of collaborations

811
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,798
which includes the last waltz and raging

812
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:57,759
bull

813
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,159
martin scorsese i was saying before we

814
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,440
did that with the 600 millimeter lens

815
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,319
longest lens

816
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,919
and we really what i try to do is really

817
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,679
isolate him i tried to isolate him from

818
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,720
other people

819
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,519
and with everybody around him completely

820
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,798
soft focused like a sea

821
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,960
he's floating through a sea and he's

822
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,720
kind of floating through the city

823
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,599
and he's got a jacket on a tie and he's

824
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,839
kind of

825
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,319
um it has an element where he's

826
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,480
almost gonna be he's almost freeing

827
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,359
himself you know

828
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,880
floating through the city on the other

829
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,398
hand because of the

830
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,880
because of the speed of the film there's

831
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,839
always that element of

832
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:35,519
of uh anxiety or attention

833
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,960
uh because it's like a person

834
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,519
moving slowly before he attacks that

835
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,240
sort of thing

836
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,159
that's that's the idea that was the idea

837
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,079
but basically it was just to have that

838
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,640
moment of him can have a little bit of

839
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
peace

840
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,679
a little a little enjoyment our life for

841
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,440
once

842
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
indicative of his visually exciting

843
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,159
style martin scorsese exercises an

844
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,240
unconventional approach to portraying

845
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
the difference between the real

846
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,519
and the imagined i just thought that

847
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,558
fantasy is so real to the person who's

848
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:09,440
having it

849
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,119
uh i think you could just a good example

850
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,558
of it is like if you're really upset

851
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:13,679
about something and you can't sleep and

852
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,480
you're imagining

853
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,599
i should have said that and then you

854
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,519
imagine this so vividly you can't sleep

855
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,398
there's no way you can sleep because

856
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:19,839
it's real to you the feelings are real

857
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,200
and therefore it should be portrayed the

858
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,398
same way it shouldn't have

859
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,640
you know fog around the edges and

860
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,679
shouldn't have people

861
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,038
zooming in and out on their faces you

862
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,278
should really do it as as

863
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:31,359
as realistically as possible and i think

864
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,640
we did a lot of that straighter straight

865
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,319
ahead in king of comedy we just cut

866
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:34,960
directly

867
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,319
and the fantasies were right there

868
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,759
because they are so vivid and so real

869
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,440
because fantasy's

870
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,119
fantasies and imagination i think is

871
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,119
what what makes people

872
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,798
run they make makes you makes you keep

873
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:46,720
going i mean keeps you going in life and

874
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,359
uh

875
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,880
why try to to hide it in a way i i think

876
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,000
it was so interesting

877
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
that just gave me the idea of of doing

878
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,278
it

879
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:57,919
as matter-of-factly as possible now the

880
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,558
reality

881
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,240
i would slow down into slow motion

882
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,200
you know it's sometimes uh it's the way

883
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,759
let's say

884
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,880
uh you be you'll be uh

885
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,159
something will be hap what happened to

886
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,079
you let's say and you've been in a

887
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,440
conversation with someone

888
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,759
and as you're saying something as

889
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,720
something's being said to you which is

890
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,000
highly unpleasant or something really

891
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,720
wonderful

892
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,200
you remember looking at what the person

893
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,398
was doing whether it's playing with a

894
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:24,240
pencil in her hand or

895
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,558
playing with a glass and whenever you

896
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:27,519
remember the conversation the first

897
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,880
image that comes back to me for example

898
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
is my hand in the glass

899
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,839
what i felt when she said that or he

900
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,519
said that so that would be the shot i

901
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,558
would take

902
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:36,798
and i do that in slow motion because

903
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:38,398
sort of burns in your memory i started

904
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:39,519
playing around with it a lot in mean

905
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,240
streets

906
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,240
where natural very very simple um

907
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,200
simple gestures were done in slow motion

908
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,558
lighting of a cigarette

909
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,519
taking a drink rather than the violence

910
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,960
in slow motion usually in my movies when

911
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,000
violence is in slow motion

912
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,480
because you can't see it otherwise you

913
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,159
can't see the punch you can't see the

914
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,679
the knife going in or that you know i'm

915
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,079
saying we have to slow it down

916
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,519
we have to speed up the film slow down

917
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,200
the image so that you can

918
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,599
see the action and raging bull is a

919
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,798
perfect example of that we didn't

920
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:10,398
necessarily want to do constantly slow

921
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:11,440
motion

922
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,879
we had no choice at certain times

923
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:16,880
the slow motion was more important when

924
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,480
he'd move away from the opponent

925
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,319
and lift his trunks up as he was doing

926
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,240
so you know and get back into the corner

927
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,679
that's in slow motion i thought in some

928
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,640
cases that's that's

929
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,919
interesting those gestures that stick

930
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,038
out in your mind if you're watching the

931
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:27,839
fight

932
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,278
you know and you say oh boy that guy

933
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:30,798
moved around or see what he did with his

934
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:32,240
hands or his feet look at his look at

935
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,558
his

936
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:34,720
look at his foot action you know and do

937
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,319
that in slow motion that's interesting

938
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,398
but um um i mean the man who did

939
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:42,558
violence in slow motion has a patent on

940
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:43,440
it

941
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,798
is sam peckham pause so you don't mess

942
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:45,759
you don't mess around with that what's

943
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:46,960
what's the point

944
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,319
now the only way i'm the only way you

945
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,919
have to do it is to do it for another

946
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,679
effect or to literally let the audience

947
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,319
see

948
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,398
what is going on now this was the very

949
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:55,650
first shot i thought of

950
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,038
[Music]

951
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,480
and i thought it was important maybe you

952
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,960
had a virus because of what happens in

953
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,039
it

954
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,240
where um the main action is here

955
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:11,999
him on the phone

956
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,359
and the composition being off centered

957
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,398
would you like to have

958
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,919
some dinner with me um the next you know

959
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,880
keeping keeping it on him it was so

960
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,679
uncomfortable

961
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,679
for him this conversation come by

962
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,519
and holding it on him and he's just

963
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,720
getting refused and

964
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,960
rejected and rejected and rejected okay

965
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,599
did you get my flowers in there and i

966
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,200
get the point about the flowers

967
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,320
and the camera starts to move

968
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,359
[Music]

969
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,240
as if it's about to reveal something and

970
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,880
uh

971
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,839
it doesn't i think the revelation is the

972
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,038
idea it was meant that the revelation

973
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:53,919
comes much later

974
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,960
when he when he uh explodes i think it

975
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,480
was one of the last shots we took in the

976
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,159
last day of shooting

977
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,159
then he enters the frame and leaves when

978
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,440
i thought of that shot

979
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,880
it gave it it presented to me

980
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,119
how the style the picture would be where

981
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,240
the moves would be

982
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,278
the camera moves would seem

983
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:14,960
uh if i could really put in words i

984
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,398
wouldn't have had to put it on film

985
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,398
the idea is that there's a sense again

986
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:20,880
of anxiety a sense of uh uneasiness

987
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,679
of the camera tracking to an empty hall

988
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,558
is that

989
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:26,398
is that his soul is that is that his uh

990
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:27,519
you know whatever whatever you want to

991
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,159
think of it

992
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,759
the emptiness he's feeling in his heart

993
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,919
or whatever or are we about to reveal

994
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:32,640
something that's

995
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
or is there about to be an explosion is

996
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,278
something terrible going to happen in

997
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:35,919
the hall

998
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,599
you know uh it was the idea of keeping

999
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,519
the audience off balance all the time

1000
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,720
and that was that was the piece

1001
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,398
of all the other shots came from that

1002
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:46,319
concept that's that's in that shot right

1003
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,278
now

1004
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:48,319
i was supposed to just done a little

1005
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,480
walk-on but

1006
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,599
the reason i did this this was shot the

1007
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,200
last week of shooting

1008
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,119
and i had used every actor that i knew

1009
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,038
in new york up to that point

1010
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,159
and uh the scene for me was quite an

1011
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,038
important scene

1012
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:05,359
and i had an actor named george mamalee

1013
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,640
or sometimes would go by the name of

1014
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,440
george terry

1015
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,398
was a very heavy guy who was in um mean

1016
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:10,960
streets

1017
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
in that scene in in the pool hall where

1018
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,640
they talk about you he calls the other

1019
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,480
kids uh you know calls the other boy a

1020
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,240
mook

1021
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,000
and uh george george emily was supposed

1022
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,119
to play this he was a comic it was a

1023
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,839
wonderful comic

1024
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,919
and what happened was that uh he was

1025
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,119
working on another film

1026
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,558
in the south somewhere and he did a he

1027
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,359
did a um uh stunt he wanted to do a sort

1028
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,558
of a shotgun blast he was supposed to

1029
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:34,798
fall back but he was about 400 pounds

1030
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,200
and he uh broke his head and he was in

1031
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,720
very very bad

1032
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,919
condition uh

1033
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,359
and i just couldn't get anyone the last

1034
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,519
last minute so i did it myself and bob

1035
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,599
see this business here what he's doing

1036
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,798
the back of his head i remember him

1037
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:50,000
acting with the back of his head

1038
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,359
to me just the the body moves on him or

1039
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,798
the lack of movement

1040
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,919
forced me to um uh

1041
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,519
do these uh force me to respond

1042
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,960
what i had to do when i had to do the

1043
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,319
scene when i realized i had to do it i

1044
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:04,640
was

1045
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,558
nervous about it in terms of always

1046
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:07,839
nervous about that i don't i don't like

1047
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,280
being in front of a camera

1048
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,719
and don't like hearing my voice on

1049
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,679
on film or on tape or on these laser

1050
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,320
discs

1051
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,559
so i don't uh i don't usually listen to

1052
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,280
them but

1053
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,760
with bob it became it became fun and

1054
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,719
became fun

1055
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,439
and so um

1056
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
literally we had no choice we had no

1057
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,119
choice at the time remember i remember

1058
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,398
paul was nervous when he heard that i

1059
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:33,679
had to do the scene

1060
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,039
but then he saw the rushes and he liked

1061
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,199
it i remember looking at the rushes from

1062
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,398
the projection booth

1063
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:41,358
i wouldn't uh watch all the rushes from

1064
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:42,639
from inside but

1065
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,398
later on i think marcia lucas and myself

1066
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:46,480
we had a pretty good time cutting it

1067
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,079
but um i was confident in that with bob

1068
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,760
something would happen

1069
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,838
something would come out of it to that

1070
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:54,960
extent and

1071
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,639
worse came to worse i mean there was

1072
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,400
only one sequence in the film

1073
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,800
you know we could lose it we could lose

1074
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,159
it you know it would it wouldn't really

1075
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,559
break the structure of the picture

1076
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,159
at least i thought so then but now

1077
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,559
seeing that it comes right after when he

1078
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,320
says women are like a union

1079
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,079
when i see that now of course that uh

1080
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,199
you know as i said i haven't seen this

1081
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,400
film since i made it it's the first time

1082
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,519
i've seen it

1083
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,559
since 76 so i see that that's

1084
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,639
very tightly constructed and luckily uh

1085
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,838
it seemed to have worked out

1086
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:26,159
i was offered a lot of parts from this

1087
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,280
but uh

1088
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,679
again it i you know i don't usually do

1089
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,960
that the last thing i just did was with

1090
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,239
chris howard's film

1091
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,280
i'm going to kill her i'm going to kill

1092
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,559
her with a 44 vincent van gogh

1093
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,719
in hokkaido in japan not that van gogh

1094
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,838
was in japan it was

1095
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,199
scenes supposed to be france but shot in

1096
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,960
japan and

1097
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,039
i got to act in a new film that erwin

1098
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,400
winkler is directing

1099
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,239
with bob de niro and do some more scenes

1100
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,400
with bob but there won't be like

1101
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,320
it's not of this nature though martin

1102
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,800
scorsese's only choice to score the film

1103
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,280
was veteran composer bernard herrmann

1104
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,039
known for his ability to capture the

1105
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,039
darker side of human nature through his

1106
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:01,760
music

1107
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,239
i got to i got to speak to him through

1108
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,199
brian de palma

1109
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,960
and brian i've been using him as a

1110
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
composer on his films

1111
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,039
and also through a dutch filmmaker named

1112
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,320
pim de la perra

1113
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,519
and i believe call i called him from

1114
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,119
holland first and i asked him on the

1115
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:15,519
phone

1116
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,760
he was in london i asked him if he would

1117
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,559
do this movie

1118
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,679
called taxi driver says i don't do

1119
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,000
pictures about cab drivers i said

1120
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,599
i said no it's not really about a taxi

1121
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,199
driver that's not the idea mean you've

1122
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,239
got to read the script oh send me the

1123
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,358
script it's very

1124
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,320
very very uh what's the word uh you know

1125
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,159
cantankerous on the phone so

1126
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,920
so we did and uh i had told

1127
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,199
michael phillips and julia phillips the

1128
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,280
producers of the picture way back

1129
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
before we started even pre-production

1130
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
that uh the way to do this picture would

1131
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,838
have to you'd have to have a bernard

1132
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,599
herman score there's no other way

1133
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,039
and if you look back i think he's the

1134
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,519
only person i've ever used

1135
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,480
scoring my films i think on after hours

1136
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,679
i used a gentleman named howard shaw but

1137
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,358
it was a different type of picture

1138
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:56,960
on color of money robbie robertson did

1139
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,480
some sort of scoring for me with willie

1140
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,679
dixon and people like that but it was

1141
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,559
more

1142
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:03,679
more in the vein of actual uh songs that

1143
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,719
were used

1144
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,800
who write songs or get a sense of mood

1145
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,159
music in there but the actual

1146
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,039
composition

1147
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,800
actually actual music composed for film

1148
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,920
the only one i've ever done was bernard

1149
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
herman i liked his music so much

1150
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,920
i remember becoming so aware of it in

1151
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,679
vertigo and in psycho and

1152
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:20,800
i've here to go mainly and and uh seeing

1153
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
marnie in paris for the first time

1154
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,400
not for the first time i saw it on

1155
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,679
television i saw it on television for

1156
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,199
the first time in america

1157
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,199
and then in paris the night that the

1158
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,880
bride wore black opened

1159
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,480
truffaut had a special screening at the

1160
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,358
cinema tech to protest on rilangua being

1161
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:37,920
taken taken off the roster of the head

1162
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,358
of the cinema tech in paris at the time

1163
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,880
1968

1164
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,960
and in a protest he showed the night

1165
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,480
before

1166
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,639
the the bride wore black opened he

1167
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,159
showed bradwell black and then

1168
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:50,800
marnie together and both were both were

1169
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,159
scored by bernard herman it was like

1170
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,280
four and a half hours

1171
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,960
of list that's why i really became aware

1172
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,480
of how much his music

1173
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,719
gives to a picture and of course by the

1174
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,920
way that was the

1175
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,599
that was the beginning of the rioting in

1176
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,679
france because of that right after that

1177
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,400
night

1178
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,800
in 1968 of the uh the may revolt

1179
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,480
and uh in any event i've become so much

1180
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
aware of bernard herman's music so much

1181
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,719
for so long a period of time that i

1182
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,679
really knew that the only way this

1183
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,800
picture could be made

1184
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,119
properly was to have his his music in

1185
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,079
the film

1186
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,400
his music throughout the whole picture

1187
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,119
sort of like

1188
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,079
a traditional score by him and um

1189
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,519
however i came up with the shots not

1190
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,960
from bernard herman's music came up with

1191
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,000
the shots by listening to van

1192
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,960
morrison's tv sheets a song called tb

1193
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,358
sheets

1194
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,599
about a nine or ten minute piece and it

1195
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,358
was kind of a blues

1196
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,199
riff that he had and he kept repeating

1197
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,760
words like foreign bodies

1198
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
very strange foreign bodies he kept

1199
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,960
saying and uh

1200
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,280
his poetry uh i think van morrison's a

1201
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,039
great poet you know

1202
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,239
and uh the sense of doom and the sense

1203
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:54,719
of uh

1204
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,760
fate that tb sheets had that's how i

1205
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,960
imagined the first shot of the car

1206
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,559
coming through the steam

1207
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,679
i mean it was hard for me to imagine

1208
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,880
brought out her music to it i just

1209
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,079
listened to all this

1210
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,639
you know in any event i got to meet mr

1211
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,519
herman

1212
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,519
in london if he had read the script and

1213
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,559
he did like

1214
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,838
very much he liked the script very much

1215
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:14,000
and he liked the idea that he uh he

1216
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,838
liked the character devices uh little

1217
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:17,440
things for character for example the way

1218
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,039
he ate the

1219
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,880
cereal by putting a peach brandy on it

1220
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,760
you know he thought that was really

1221
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,199
interesting

1222
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,119
and then after we worked out a deal

1223
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,039
at that time there was no videotape so

1224
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,159
he couldn't come to

1225
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,079
la we had to send black and white dupes

1226
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,440
to him

1227
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,838
and we would send a reel as it was cut

1228
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,119
and we had about two phone calls i

1229
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:37,760
remember

1230
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,199
and one in which he said the first phone

1231
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,639
call he said i got the footage it looks

1232
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,519
good

1233
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,119
and he said basically the way i see it

1234
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,719
he said i know what to do now he says

1235
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,960
it's all brass

1236
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,039
it's uh i remember the the reel was the

1237
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,320
reel that we sent him was the one of him

1238
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,880
um

1239
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,639
working out in his apartment he said

1240
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,480
it's all brass you can hear the horns

1241
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,159
there you can hear the brass instruments

1242
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,119
he said no strings all brass uh in a way

1243
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,159
um

1244
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,199
and it reflects the iron will of this

1245
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,079
guy and

1246
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,920
uh the sense of his body the the sense

1247
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,599
of

1248
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,760
the physical quality that he wanted to

1249
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,199
achieve the sense of strength

1250
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,079
you know that travis wanted to achieve

1251
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,599
and that's that was his clue that was

1252
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,400
his main clue

1253
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,800
that was the only artistic insight i got

1254
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,599
it from him

1255
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,760
into into actually his score then later

1256
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,639
on he said um

1257
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,000
he was i went to london we were in

1258
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,599
london and we were talking about the

1259
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,199
fact that he was going to mix

1260
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,480
um kind of uh jazz

1261
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,838
with it and he felt he was onto

1262
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:33,358
something new with his work by doing

1263
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:34,960
that i believe tom scott did the

1264
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,880
alto sax yeah he uh wrote

1265
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,239
that uh jazz uh he wrote that sax

1266
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,400
solo those sacks uh those chords for

1267
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,920
those bars of music for the saks

1268
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,679
saxophone that you hear the beginning

1269
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,719
and all the way through the film that

1270
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,679
kind of plaintiff

1271
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,599
scent lonely sense that people some

1272
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,039
people are criticized

1273
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,440
uh as being toon warish from the 40s and

1274
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,800
that sort of thing but that's part of

1275
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,480
that's part of the the the homage of the

1276
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,400
film that's part of that's part of the

1277
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,519
that's part of the i shouldn't say

1278
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,960
homage that's part of the lineage of the

1279
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,239
film

1280
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,119
of american cinema and if somebody said

1281
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,400
yeah it reminds me of mark hellinger

1282
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,358
presents

1283
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:11,199
i said why not you know what's wrong

1284
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,039
with that

1285
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,239
it's the old line you got a problem with

1286
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,559
that he came to los angeles and we were

1287
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,400
in la and he sat down with me and he

1288
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,880
showed

1289
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,119
the film was pretty much cut and he

1290
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,719
showed where on the black and white dupe

1291
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,199
where he'd be

1292
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,358
bringing in the music and it would be a

1293
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,800
lot

1294
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,599
a grease pencil mark and he said okay

1295
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,318
q47 is here q12 is here

1296
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:33,358
and that sort of thing i think we used

1297
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,400
all those cues there was only one that

1298
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,000
we didn't use which was the boys coming

1299
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,239
out

1300
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,199
when he comes out of the bellmore

1301
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,440
cafeteria and there was some there was

1302
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,000
some

1303
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,719
young tufts walking by and it sounded a

1304
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,079
little too obtrusive to us

1305
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,358
and we dropped that little it was about

1306
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,358
a 20 second queue or 15 second queue

1307
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:51,358
but he was there during most of the mix

1308
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:52,400
and he did complain

1309
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,358
about you know the way the mixers put

1310
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:56,159
sound effects

1311
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,920
up over the music or on the same level

1312
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,838
with the music so i don't forget him

1313
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:01,039
complaining and

1314
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,000
yelling at the mixers what's that noise

1315
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,039
on my music

1316
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,480
well if you want if you pay me to put

1317
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,880
music in why are you putting noise over

1318
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,119
it

1319
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,559
get it out yeah okay

1320
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:14,000
and we took it he was right basically

1321
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,760
correct but it's really interesting it's

1322
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,800
much more eerie

1323
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,639
in that sequence when he's driving to

1324
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,000
kill everybody with

1325
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,318
with the sound effects way down way down

1326
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:23,519
you know

1327
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,159
um and it was his you know his choice

1328
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:28,000
not to put music over the uh

1329
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,119
over the shootout which i think was

1330
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,639
really important only to bring it in at

1331
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:32,480
the very end as the camera comes over

1332
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,000
as the camera has a nice high angle shot

1333
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,358
that we had originally a paul wrote in

1334
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:36,159
his script

1335
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,599
i believe the last thing he did was he

1336
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,760
said he said he said to that sting at

1337
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,480
the end

1338
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,000
to play it backwards and right before

1339
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,800
that he had recorded that was part that

1340
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,760
was the end of a session which he

1341
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,039
recorded with tom scott

1342
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,960
and a group of musicians the uh

1343
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,639
saxophone track

1344
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,280
and uh he had two takes his every call

1345
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,559
he did two takes first take the way it

1346
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:57,199
was written

1347
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,480
second take he says improvise a little

1348
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,239
bit do what you want and then he did

1349
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,519
that little sting for me and simply

1350
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:02,639
backwards and that was it and then night

1351
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:04,079
he went to have dinner with larry cohen

1352
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,679
the director of it's live and it's live

1353
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,440
again and pictures like that

1354
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,800
and he was writing music i think at the

1355
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,960
in the restaurant and then that

1356
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,800
morning he died there was a uh service

1357
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,318
out in los angeles and

1358
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:16,079
john williams came remember john

1359
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,760
williams came to the hotel was there

1360
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,400
with them

1361
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,079
or whatever they'd take care of the body

1362
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,079
and johnny williams showed up

1363
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,599
took care of everything but uh

1364
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,719
that was it that was it

1365
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:33,119
and then he was nominated for it but he

1366
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,440
was also nominated for obsession

1367
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,880
the same year and he canceled himself

1368
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,519
out and i was at the academy awards and

1369
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:40,719
i was supposed to pick up for him if he

1370
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,239
won

1371
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:44,800
but uh obsession was actually recorded

1372
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,920
and finished completely

1373
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,400
finished before my film so it wasn't the

1374
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,920
last score ob session it was it was

1375
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,159
it came out after taxi driver but it was

1376
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:52,960
it was uh

1377
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,119
taxi driver was the last thing he did

1378
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,239
and this is pretty much one of these

1379
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:58,079
shots we just couldn't tell anymore

1380
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,280
who were the real street people and who

1381
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,000
were the ones who were he's an actor

1382
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,679
but some of the other people we just

1383
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,800
couldn't tell anymore it just got to the

1384
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,760
point that we're in the frame we

1385
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,800
couldn't help it

1386
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,920
we don't know what was real what was

1387
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,880
left from the movie

1388
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,838
it may come out of some of my own

1389
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:19,119
experience

1390
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,599
with the city that's all i mean mainly

1391
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,159
because i

1392
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,639
grew up in the city but uh as i say i

1393
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:25,199
knew what

1394
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,719
exactly what locations to go to and in

1395
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,559
fact even when

1396
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:30,719
you see cuts of a cart of the cab

1397
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,480
turning one corner or another

1398
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,079
we are in the realistic location in

1399
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,679
other words we don't cut

1400
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,519
turning a left turn from 14th street and

1401
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:41,358
you cut and he's an 86th street

1402
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:42,639
you know it turns the corner and that's

1403
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,838
supposed to be a continuation of the

1404
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:44,800
same scene

1405
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,039
but no time change that's not the case

1406
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:48,159
uh we really

1407
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,719
we tried as much as possible to be to be

1408
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:52,400
uh accurate about that so people who

1409
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,800
know new york would say that's possible

1410
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,000
there have been certain films made

1411
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,639
recently where

1412
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:58,719
a person picked up a bottle of wine on

1413
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:00,960
mulberry street and turned the corner

1414
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,519
home on uh on brooklyn will look like

1415
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:05,519
brooklyn heights

1416
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,599
which is she walked home i said she's

1417
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,800
having some walk

1418
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,239
you know she walked all the way from

1419
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:11,519
mulberry all the way to because i know

1420
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:12,719
the city you see

1421
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:14,880
so so that's the kind of thing we tried

1422
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,719
to avoid

1423
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,079
but that's basically in my sense of the

1424
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,760
city it's all over there and

1425
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,358
the for example when wizarding him and

1426
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:22,639
talking outside the belmont the guy

1427
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:23,679
being arrested in the background that

1428
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,400
was constant

1429
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,318
constant going on if you hang out in the

1430
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:27,358
streets at night in the summer that

1431
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,039
happens every three seconds

1432
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:30,318
in most of the areas that this film is

1433
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:31,679
taking place so you know it's just

1434
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:33,760
observation

1435
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,000
you put it in as much as you can junkies

1436
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,599
stretched out over over

1437
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,960
over car hoods and naked from the waist

1438
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,920
up and

1439
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,079
just stretched out practically dead in

1440
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,000
the street i mean that's that's constant

1441
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,519
especially in the summertime

1442
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,280
and you see that all the time uh there

1443
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
was one shot of

1444
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,159
travis and andy going in the uh the

1445
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:54,800
hotel

1446
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,159
that was taken out of the film which we

1447
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:58,239
had the which we had the junkie laid

1448
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:59,358
over the

1449
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:02,239
lying on his back on the hood of a car

1450
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,199
looking half dead

1451
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,239
completely like resting you know but um

1452
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,239
that shot didn't make it in the picture

1453
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,079
stephen prince played the uh

1454
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,358
the andy the

1455
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:16,639
gun salesman and steve

1456
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,960
was a uh it was a roadie i think for a

1457
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,838
while

1458
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,960
with neil diamond and uh

1459
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,079
kind of part-time comic and uh

1460
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,838
raconteur of the 60s and 70s

1461
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:33,599
of uh we um this was the first

1462
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,679
the first acting he had done in the film

1463
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:38,480
and then sort of inspired a um

1464
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,679
spiders to do a documentary of him

1465
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:44,800
and in which he told uh stories

1466
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,039
about his growing up and his lifestyle

1467
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,119
which led into drugs and uh

1468
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,119
eventual uh um

1469
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,358
evening out i'd say by around 1976-77

1470
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,559
um what i mean by that is sort of a

1471
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:03,199
kind of leveling off period where people

1472
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:04,559
were sort of marking time in that in the

1473
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:05,599
70s

1474
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,880
and i made the documentary

1475
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,000
it took about a couple of years to put

1476
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,199
together in terms of what questions

1477
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,400
we're going to ask what stories he was

1478
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,199
going to tell

1479
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,519
then we shot him one night all in one

1480
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,358
night after shooting the last waltz

1481
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:19,440
and michael chapman shot it in 16

1482
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,960
millimeter in california in george

1483
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,719
emily's house actually george the actor

1484
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:23,920
was supposed to play the part i did in

1485
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,318
the

1486
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,199
taxi cabinet later uh became very who

1487
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:28,880
got a terrible accident

1488
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,440
and uh steve um

1489
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,358
it was a very strong movie i think it's

1490
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:37,119
only an hour less than an hour long

1491
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,440
and it's called american boy and it's

1492
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,480
shown usually with the

1493
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,480
films of the film i did in my parents

1494
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,480
called italian american

1495
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,920
and sort of a uh part of uh

1496
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,599
americana that i thought was kind of

1497
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,960
important i was trying i was trying at

1498
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,079
the time through these documentaries in

1499
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,280
between each picture

1500
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,480
to try to to uh

1501
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,519
chronicle people i knew and

1502
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,639
a sense a sense of the country changing

1503
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:09,280
in fact italian american was sort of the

1504
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,960
counterpart to

1505
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,559
mean streets american boy

1506
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,039
is the documentary counterpart to taxi

1507
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:17,838
driver

1508
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:20,000
so they go together new york new york

1509
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,079
and the last waltz go together

1510
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,960
you see that was the idea uh they all

1511
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,599
seem to work

1512
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,239
one out of each other again trying to

1513
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:28,800
push the

1514
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,880
narrative forward by jump cutting as

1515
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,239
much as possible by

1516
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,318
cutting out of time and pushing it

1517
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,039
i remember that's the kind of thing i

1518
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:39,838
really enjoy

1519
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:42,079
in the editing of a picture when it

1520
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,639
starts to move like that

1521
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,719
martin scorsese talks about preparing

1522
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:48,239
for the film

1523
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,519
preparation i mean basically is the

1524
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:52,159
usual which i work

1525
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:53,599
some suggestions to straighter in the

1526
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,358
script and very little because i said

1527
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:57,920
the script was like perfect for me and

1528
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,280
uh envisioning all the shots

1529
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,599
i would draw the the shots on the side

1530
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,639
of the script

1531
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:08,318
and break it down into into setups

1532
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,358
and angles and moves and then i would

1533
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:12,239
take those notes

1534
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:14,400
and transfer them to actual drawings in

1535
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,239
storyboards on storyboards that you make

1536
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:18,318
for tv commercials that they have

1537
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:20,079
so that the entire crew could see every

1538
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,519
day the amount of shots we were getting

1539
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:23,679
the type of shots we're going to get

1540
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:25,599
um since then i still i i don't do

1541
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,199
anything without doing that but since

1542
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:29,039
now i just i don't transfer them to

1543
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:30,480
larger drawings i keep them small for

1544
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,440
myself and

1545
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,199
usually lately i've been working with

1546
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,960
michael balhaus

1547
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,400
as my director of photography and he

1548
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
likes he act not only likes it but he

1549
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,039
he was able to decipher the smaller

1550
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:41,679
notes

1551
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,800
so it saves me an extra step

1552
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,358
but at that time michael chapman was the

1553
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:48,639
first in my work with chapman we had a

1554
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:50,400
good time playing with those drawings

1555
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,880
one day i did i had the art director do

1556
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,559
some drawings for me instead

1557
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,440
but mr chapman insisted i continue doing

1558
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
the because he like

1559
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,719
we were talking because actually it was

1560
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:02,400
it was a matter because when other

1561
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,358
people did it looked like

1562
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,400
it looked like a comic strip which was

1563
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,039
good

1564
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,679
but when i did it it was a matter of the

1565
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,440
actual the arrows pointing for camera

1566
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,559
movements and things like that that you

1567
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,199
had

1568
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:14,960
and that was what he needed to see he

1569
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,639
needed to see and it was very simple you

1570
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,519
take these

1571
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:18,960
these shots and we get as many as

1572
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,800
possible for the day and then if we have

1573
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,599
two left

1574
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:22,880
they were literally these two left in

1575
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,318
our hand here on our right hand we got

1576
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:25,599
to get them we got to pick them up

1577
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,599
got to get them later so you know after

1578
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,800
a while you had a stack of shots that

1579
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,318
you that you were you were behind

1580
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,920
you know it was a very simple thing it

1581
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,440
was it was um

1582
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,880
i just spent lots of time drawing the

1583
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,639
pictures and drawing the pictures

1584
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:38,960
uh in the hotel suite i had at the st

1585
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,719
regis hotel

1586
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:43,838
and uh the other preparation that

1587
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:45,679
de niro did was to become a taxi driver

1588
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:46,960
for

1589
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,199
a few nights a couple of weeks i think

1590
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:50,079
it was really one

1591
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,358
he just won the academy award for

1592
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:53,920
godfather too best supporting actor and

1593
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,318
an actor got in the cab one night

1594
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:59,039
and saw he said i can't believe it he

1595
00:50:59,039 --> 00:50:59,519
says

1596
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:00,800
i thought it was you and he said i

1597
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,079
leaned over and i saw i see your name

1598
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,358
there robert de niro you're driving a

1599
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:04,960
cab you just won the academy award

1600
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,079
you mean things are that bad

1601
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,599
is the business this tough he said yeah

1602
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,199
it is

1603
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:12,719
but i went driving with him one night i

1604
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:14,800
sat in the front seat and

1605
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,440
and uh you know people got in and just i

1606
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,039
mean driving up and down 8th avenue is a

1607
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:21,039
rough area it still is

1608
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,880
it's uh yeah i don't know who you know

1609
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,760
who's getting in you know you're gonna

1610
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,800
be robbed you're gonna be shot or

1611
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,599
whatever

1612
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,760
and that's that's the sense of i guess

1613
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,400
the words come to my nihilism or or uh

1614
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,000
existential

1615
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,880
existence you know every 15 minutes or

1616
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,318
20 minutes uh

1617
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:39,358
you don't know where you're going or

1618
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:41,039
what's going to happen to you you have

1619
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,199
no control over your life

1620
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,480
and he felt that was perfect for his

1621
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,960
character there was talk at one time

1622
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,000
because we had so much trouble getting

1623
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,280
the money together during the film like

1624
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,079
in san francisco

1625
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,760
or some other place no no no no it has

1626
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,880
to be new york because that's that's the

1627
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,480
center for taxi cabs they really are you

1628
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,039
know

1629
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:56,480
and as i say anybody who drives a cab

1630
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,519
even one night in new york you're going

1631
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:58,159
to get like

1632
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,679
travis so you can't you can't help it i

1633
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:01,358
mean it's just the traffic and the sense

1634
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:02,559
of the city itself

1635
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:03,679
that's an exaggeration of course but

1636
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:05,760
what i'm saying is that people who drive

1637
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,838
cabs for any particu

1638
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:09,760
any particular period any long period of

1639
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,960
time in the city

1640
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,280
um or drive any car in the city try to

1641
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,159
do it every day

1642
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:19,440
you you begin to get a little edgy

1643
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,519
this was sort of an interim look for

1644
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:24,400
travis and we cut his hair

1645
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,119
and uh and the fellow in the center here

1646
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,880
with the shorter fellow with the

1647
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,880
police's uh the glasses there's a old

1648
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,559
friend of mine named vic magnata

1649
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,199
and vic was one of us stuntmen actually

1650
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,639
we went to nyu together new york

1651
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:38,318
university and we studied film together

1652
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,000
and he worked with me a lot um he then

1653
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,719
went to vietnam and when he came out

1654
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:46,239
went into um

1655
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:48,400
stunt work in films and he was very

1656
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,318
influential in in deciding later

1657
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:51,920
or helping us decide later on on how

1658
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,440
travis should look

1659
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,000
um with the uh mohawk haircut

1660
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,199
because he explained he showed us some

1661
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:01,039
pictures of um

1662
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:02,719
fellas in vietnam who would uh have

1663
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:04,400
their hair kind of cut that way

1664
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,559
and uh he said in saigon we'd see them

1665
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,079
and we know they're out for something

1666
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:08,880
special or

1667
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,079
they're about to go out to do something

1668
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,239
special and so we decided to go with

1669
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:14,480
that unfortunately vic died on a film

1670
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,039
a few years ago in a stunt in new york

1671
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:21,358
hey you're a secret service man aren't

1672
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:23,519
you

1673
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:25,920
no just waiting i always enjoyed i

1674
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,280
always enjoyed working with the secret

1675
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,159
service

1676
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:29,280
this actor playing secret service

1677
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,480
because he was so tall and we could look

1678
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,358
down on on

1679
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:33,679
bob right over his ear and the line of

1680
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:34,639
his eyeglasses right

1681
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:37,119
one of his sunglasses right on to uh ran

1682
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,280
into bob's car right onto travis here

1683
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,838
paul schrader he has a jacket that says

1684
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:43,599
king kong company

1685
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,280
uh from which you can infer that perhaps

1686
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,199
he had something to do with the

1687
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,400
viet cong uh or not infer

1688
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,358
and uh and it and it intentionally was

1689
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:56,318
left

1690
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:01,199
as subtext it was never in the text and

1691
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,758
and so that i think that

1692
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,440
was something that is left up to the

1693
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,199
viewers you know discretion

1694
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,838
i mean war does not make psychopaths and

1695
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:17,358
it would have been too simple to

1696
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,480
draw that straight analogy war can make

1697
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,199
psychopaths

1698
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:23,358
but it doesn't necessarily make them

1699
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:24,400
this man was created

1700
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,880
his psychopath his psychopathology was

1701
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,800
created by himself he didn't need

1702
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,679
vietnam to create it now the script i

1703
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,719
believe had us saying that he was

1704
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:33,920
preparing in front of the mirror the

1705
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,358
actual

1706
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:37,519
dialogue that bob is coming up with here

1707
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:39,039
uh i just mentioned bob i said i really

1708
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:39,679
think this was

1709
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,159
again towards the last week of shooting

1710
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:43,440
and i was saying to him i really think

1711
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,880
we need for you to speak in the mirror

1712
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,639
speak to yourself in the mirror

1713
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:49,358
and so um he came up with this dialogue

1714
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:51,039
i remember i was sitting at his feet

1715
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,719
on the ground and i had earphones on and

1716
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:54,000
all i heard was the city sounds they

1717
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,798
were too strong i

1718
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:56,480
asked him to keep repeating himself and

1719
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,679
then he sort of got into a role i don't

1720
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:59,039
know what happened somehow it got into a

1721
00:54:59,039 --> 00:54:59,760
role and we took

1722
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,880
it took quite a while to do this with

1723
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,480
about three hours to do at one point bob

1724
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,358
called me up and asked me would you know

1725
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:08,400
this character say

1726
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,440
such a thing and i said to him

1727
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,880
um uh

1728
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,719
bob you don't you know travis beckham

1729
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:18,480
much better than i do at this point

1730
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,159
and if you think he would he probably

1731
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:23,837
would you talking to me

1732
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,039
you talking to me then of course the

1733
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:29,119
most famous line in the movie is

1734
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,039
in the improv which is the you talking

1735
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,000
to me in the script it simply says

1736
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,920
travis looks at the mirror speaks to

1737
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,199
himself

1738
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:39,358
so he had to come up with something and

1739
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:41,039
he came up with this kind of tag line

1740
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,079
that had been

1741
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,798
in use by a comic you know in the

1742
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:45,280
village

1743
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,119
as part of a skit and and so

1744
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,119
the irony is that the most famous client

1745
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,558
is not mine

1746
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:57,440
back down to 14th street that's a real

1747
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,559
cop car going by

1748
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,159
i hear those bernard herman's

1749
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,920
those bars of music that's the first

1750
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,358
time we hear them they always remind me

1751
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:08,719
of psycho and they remind me of

1752
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:09,838
marny in a few of the films where you

1753
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:12,079
hear the same the same uh

1754
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,639
chords i should say not bars but chords

1755
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,880
this shot again divides all in one all

1756
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,639
in one take where we hear the uh

1757
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:22,798
robbery going off on off camera and we

1758
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:23,679
track back

1759
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,358
it picks up the uh the robber in the

1760
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:27,760
frame so we stay with his reaction

1761
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,480
rather than

1762
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,838
what you normally would see would be the

1763
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:31,280
guy coming in pulling the gun at very

1764
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,519
boring so we stay with him

1765
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:35,358
now we track behind the bar i mean

1766
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,479
behind the counter

1767
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,960
and then you have your cuts paul

1768
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,239
schrader

1769
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,440
we had to make one concession to

1770
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,798
social reality

1771
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:54,318
which was that the element of racism was

1772
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:56,159
much stronger

1773
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,159
the character was much more racist he is

1774
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:00,318
a racist

1775
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:02,559
he was morally racist and at the end he

1776
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,039
killed all black people

1777
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:08,559
and uh and that just became so

1778
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,119
even though it's true it became so

1779
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,519
socially volatile

1780
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:16,798
that uh that

1781
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:19,119
the character of the black pimp was made

1782
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,039
into the white pill

1783
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,400
and and in fact i had to try to scout

1784
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,000
around town for harvey

1785
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,760
keitel's take to try to find a white

1786
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,960
pimp that he could emulate himself on

1787
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,400
we never did find one um

1788
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,559
but i i you know i think that

1789
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,318
you know in a novel you could have that

1790
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:42,159
element uh

1791
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,599
that true element of racism on a part of

1792
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:45,920
the

1793
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,920
psychopathic character but in the film

1794
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,199
it became

1795
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,679
socially irresponsible to take it that

1796
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:52,880
far

1797
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
it's still there you know it hasn't been

1798
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,719
taken out but it is not

1799
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,798
as as repugnant as it would have been

1800
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:03,039
had it stayed in the characters are

1801
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:04,318
racist

1802
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:07,599
uh simply because any any person who's

1803
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,639
low on the pole

1804
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,039
or imagines himself low on the pole is

1805
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:12,159
going to pick on the person

1806
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,239
who he perceived to be even lower than

1807
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:15,440
him

1808
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,960
you know and uh you know that's how

1809
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,400
that contradictory

1810
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,318
neurotic frustration comes out you know

1811
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,679
you you you blame it on the blacks and

1812
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:31,679
the chicanos and the japanese you know

1813
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,880
they're responsible for my problems

1814
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,199
and that's where the racism comes from

1815
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,400
you know

1816
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,960
it's it's the act of of uh of a loser

1817
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,519
[Music]

1818
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,639
i mean and racism is in fact you know

1819
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:49,280
the attitude of a loser you know a

1820
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,880
winner does not need to be a racist a

1821
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,480
loser does

1822
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,318
as soon as marty said to me he said you

1823
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:55,519
know he said

1824
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,039
we just can't make them all black at the

1825
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:59,119
end we just can't and i said

1826
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,798
i you know i mean as soon as he said i

1827
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:02,960
knew he was right you know it just was

1828
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,358
too

1829
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,960
inflammatory uh

1830
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,559
you know obviously when i wrote it i

1831
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,760
wasn't even thinking of it being on

1832
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,880
screen i was thinking about the

1833
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,079
expression of the psychosis

1834
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,400
this was a very torturous scene to shoot

1835
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,679
remember my father coming home from work

1836
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,079
that day passing right by here because

1837
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,000
he worked in the garment district

1838
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
and it was uh it was so difficult

1839
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,440
because the garment district

1840
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,880
you'll see in the last shot as he pulls

1841
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,960
away

1842
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,119
it was so crowded so crowded and we got

1843
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,559
hit with a major thunderstorm

1844
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,079
midday i had all these shots to get

1845
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,358
and they were tracking they weren't just

1846
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:41,039
static like this for example when you

1847
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:41,760
make a film

1848
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,960
it's the most brutal um

1849
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,798
unpleasant experience you can imagine

1850
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:48,159
the actual physical making

1851
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:50,719
the actual shooting of a film very very

1852
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:51,760
difficult the only thing that makes it

1853
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,400
pleasant

1854
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,880
at times uh are some people that you

1855
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,760
like

1856
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,838
if you're working with them that's kind

1857
00:59:57,838 --> 00:59:59,119
of nice but uh

1858
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,400
everything else is extremely unpleasant

1859
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,199
um only you know as i said the people

1860
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,639
around you if you like them

1861
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,960
you like being with them and when every

1862
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,159
now and then something all comes

1863
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,000
together and it's quite magical

1864
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,440
and you can imagine the image without

1865
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,000
the camera crane without the uh the

1866
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,440
microphone in the shot without everybody

1867
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,480
standing around

1868
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,838
whatever you could just imagine in your

1869
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:23,440
mind's eye and you can suddenly it all

1870
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,480
comes together and something special

1871
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,519
happens let's say an actor does

1872
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:26,239
something or

1873
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,280
the camera pans and it picks up

1874
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,400
something extra special that you didn't

1875
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,599
realize well the move hits just

1876
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,119
beautifully with an action

1877
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,280
the camera move and then it becomes um

1878
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,798
very gratifying but that's only a few

1879
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:35,599
seconds

1880
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:36,719
you see something happen all together

1881
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:38,400
and then okay cut okay next set next set

1882
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,039
up

1883
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,239
the torture starts all over again right

1884
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:42,000
away there's no there's no break there's

1885
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,280
no break you know

1886
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,960
but then watching them later the only

1887
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,079
ones as i said the only films i like to

1888
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,358
watch is last temptation of christ like

1889
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:48,239
to watch

1890
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:50,798
because the music is so nice there and

1891
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:51,920
uh

1892
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,559
looks good and i like looking at the new

1893
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,199
one goodfellas because it's so funny

1894
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,119
but taxi driver raging bull mean streets

1895
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,679
new york new york much too painful

1896
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:04,000
uh experience making the picture and

1897
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,440
looking at it is just too much

1898
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,199
you know the worst part is shooting for

1899
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,039
me the worst part of a film is shooting

1900
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:11,039
uh the editing i like the best but i

1901
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,559
complain in the editing too

1902
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,439
you complain because

1903
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,199
however you complain when something

1904
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:18,719
isn't working or when you screen it

1905
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,239
after you screen it there's usually a

1906
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:22,079
three or four day depression that that

1907
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,679
end that that

1908
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:26,880
you become a part of and um and then of

1909
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,920
course there's always the torture of

1910
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,880
showing it to

1911
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,719
the people who gave you the money for it

1912
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:32,798
that's a problem and hopefully they like

1913
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:33,280
it

1914
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,318
if they really like it maybe you did

1915
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:35,358
something wrong i don't know but you

1916
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,400
know you know

1917
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,559
but but no the idea of you know they've

1918
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:39,519
got to sell it you know they've got to

1919
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:40,639
sell the picture if you make a film

1920
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:41,358
these days

1921
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:42,960
average budget about 18 million dollars

1922
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,480
20 last picture i've made costs 23

1923
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,318
probably 25 million now and when i said

1924
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:49,519
that to steve spielberg i've said this

1925
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:50,000
before

1926
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,519
but i said to steve he said steve asked

1927
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:53,760
me how much did it cost i said 23 24

1928
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,719
says that's great you're still working

1929
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:56,318
low budget

1930
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:59,760
you know so uh you know uh even though

1931
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,719
23 is pretty good budget these days for

1932
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,760
an american film

1933
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,519
pretty average budget i should say um

1934
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:09,440
it's still 23 million dollars and those

1935
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,440
people give you that money and you know

1936
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,880
it's always difficult when you have to

1937
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,960
show them the cut

1938
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,280
it's always a and they like it if they

1939
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,159
like it that's great

1940
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:19,599
you know it's really good then they got

1941
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,119
to sell it and these are hard pictures

1942
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,400
to sell that i make sometimes it's very

1943
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:22,798
hard

1944
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:24,318
you're just trying to keep these

1945
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:25,440
personal movies or whatever you want to

1946
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:25,920
call them

1947
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,358
a certain type of film being made within

1948
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:29,358
the mainstream of hollywood

1949
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,440
uh filmmaking is very hard because

1950
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,239
naturally how much money would they i

1951
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:37,119
mean if a film

1952
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,880
only appeals to a certain segment of the

1953
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,239
audience why should they give you too

1954
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:42,159
much why should they give you 40 million

1955
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,519
why should they give you 36 why should i

1956
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:45,440
give you 30. they may give you 20.

1957
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,679
and what 23 in the case of goodfellas my

1958
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:48,639
new film

1959
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,719
and it took an enormous amount of time

1960
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:52,159
to shoot and

1961
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:55,358
uh a great amount of effort and because

1962
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:55,838
we were

1963
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,318
such a low budget for that that kind of

1964
01:02:58,318 --> 01:02:59,119
a film for this

1965
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,639
kind of a story because it spanned 25

1966
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:03,760
years it was all period

1967
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,239
it was excruciatingly painful to make

1968
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:10,239
you know it wasn't like you have

1969
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:12,000
unlimited budget because it's a gangster

1970
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,440
picture only it may appeal to only a

1971
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:13,838
certain

1972
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:15,679
amount of people maybe i don't know a

1973
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,039
certain segment of society won't want to

1974
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:17,440
see it

1975
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,798
so they only give you a certain amount

1976
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:19,838
it's only natural they've got to make

1977
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,838
back some money

1978
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:23,679
uh now woody allen has a really great i

1979
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:24,960
mean he just you know he

1980
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,480
he's able to work usually on the same

1981
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,159
canvas

1982
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:29,599
and write those pictures every year and

1983
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,719
make them for a certain amount of money

1984
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,159
very very little money

1985
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:33,838
that's pretty good there's always a

1986
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:35,838
return you know

1987
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:38,318
the shooting is is is is murderous and

1988
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:39,920
then the editing is a lot of fun

1989
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,798
because that's when it really comes

1990
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:42,239
together and there's less people to

1991
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,519
answer questions

1992
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,119
questions on a set of murder just

1993
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,639
questions questions are from

1994
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:48,639
you know what about the which lens do

1995
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:49,920
you want this lens

1996
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,599
this lens will be picking up something

1997
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:52,880
in the background here i know i don't

1998
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,239
want i don't want a long lens i want

1999
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:55,920
a special lens i want i want to keep it

2000
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,280
at the 23.

2001
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,798
things like that until finally the

2002
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:01,119
questions go from from the actors to you

2003
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,159
the questions from the assistant

2004
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:03,039
director the questions from the

2005
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,159
producers the associate producers

2006
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:05,358
finally the questions from the assistant

2007
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:07,280
what do you want uh do you want coffee

2008
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,519
you know everything becomes a chore even

2009
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:11,280
answering what you want for lunch

2010
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,199
becomes uh because it's a matter of

2011
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:15,039
maybe thousands of questions each day

2012
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,480
and each one is a major decision

2013
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,798
because they're all important they

2014
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:19,920
really are all important and that's

2015
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,119
that's the problem when you get the

2016
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,159
editing room there's nobody there it's

2017
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,079
just yourself and the editor

2018
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,159
and you can have some fun but then the

2019
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:27,519
problem is showing the film and

2020
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:29,119
as people told me eventually it has to

2021
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,159
be shown to an audience but i don't like

2022
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,280
i don't want to i don't want to let it

2023
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,679
out you know why what's wrong with them

2024
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:38,079
why do they want to see it

2025
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,400
i always say if i had more money i would

2026
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,440
have shot longer

2027
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,039
i would have taken longer to shoot

2028
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,920
that's all and i would have gotten

2029
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,000
even more details of the city that's

2030
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,599
about it but when i look at it now as i

2031
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,119
said i hadn't seen the film since i made

2032
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,039
it

2033
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,960
but i'm doing the commentary here now i

2034
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,559
see this and i it looks it looks it's a

2035
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,000
pretty pretty close

2036
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,358
sense of new york in the mid 70s or

2037
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:03,280
late 70s you know remember i worked with

2038
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,559
jodie foster

2039
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,239
on alice's livery anymore for a couple

2040
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:08,000
of days in tucson she was such a

2041
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
wonderful actress

2042
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
and then i think sandy weintraub who was

2043
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,119
one of the creative consultants on the

2044
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:13,679
picture

2045
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:15,440
suggested she played this part it was

2046
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,119
important for me to get guys like murray

2047
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,559
mauston to play that kind of a part

2048
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,719
because i don't want them to seem like

2049
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,719
really villainous characters

2050
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,519
murray is not necessarily that bad a guy

2051
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:30,480
he's just uh does his job and

2052
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,679
so that later on when everything

2053
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:33,280
explodes against them it isn't your

2054
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,639
usual villain

2055
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,838
you know so it makes hopefully it makes

2056
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,000
the feelings a little more complicated

2057
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
and the audience gets i hope that was

2058
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
like this sense of him slowly coming in

2059
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,358
i think it was a slow motion

2060
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,239
and tracking come on as if something as

2061
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:49,599
if he's gonna do something terrible

2062
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,239
any moment now this was the rest of the

2063
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:52,798
uh

2064
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:54,480
the building actually on columbus

2065
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,559
columbus avenue up around 89th street

2066
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:57,119
before they

2067
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,239
uh they were taking down these buildings

2068
01:05:58,239 --> 01:05:59,760
was condemned building and uh his

2069
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,039
apartment was right down the hall in

2070
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:01,920
terms of sets

2071
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,039
we built these assets there was a

2072
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:04,960
condemned building and we even made it

2073
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,000
we even cut we cut the ceiling

2074
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,519
for the tracking shot at the end we cut

2075
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:10,719
through the ceiling we literally shot

2076
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:11,920
through the ceiling

2077
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,880
i remember bob we improv we uh we uh

2078
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,798
rehearsed these scenes a lot

2079
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:18,239
and then he would he rehearsed them with

2080
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,838
her after a while alone while i was

2081
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:21,280
doing other things that they

2082
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,039
got more familiar with each other and uh

2083
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,639
more comfortable i should say with each

2084
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,280
other

2085
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,280
and the room even though it was a built

2086
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,280
set the room was very small

2087
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,000
i only had one wild wall that is a wall

2088
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,280
that you can move when you wanted to

2089
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,520
shoot

2090
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:37,519
because i had a difficult shot to get

2091
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:38,960
which is right here i'll show you coming

2092
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,400
up

2093
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,719
that i had imagined and doing i got the

2094
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,079
idea of putting candles in there again i

2095
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,358
got a little more like a ritualistic

2096
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:46,239
idea

2097
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:48,960
uh ritualistic sense i think this one

2098
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,400
that's coming up his cut

2099
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,760
here this that's a

2100
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,119
360 around the room we have to put the

2101
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,639
wild wall back in and go back this way

2102
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,639
it was extremely difficult and cut my

2103
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:02,000
fancy kind of cut right back into her

2104
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,280
and it moves back on her which is good

2105
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,280
but i thought it was really important to

2106
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,039
show that

2107
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,239
to show his frustration

2108
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:13,679
you know a sense that he wants to save

2109
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,119
her and actually he's he's really

2110
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,559
attracted to her too

2111
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,599
and he can't face it in himself how he

2112
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:20,000
hates

2113
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,280
what the city looks like and what the

2114
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,079
city what this way of life is and how he

2115
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:24,798
really

2116
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:26,838
is attracted to it at the can leave same

2117
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:28,719
time and uh

2118
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,880
the one about that one night that's why

2119
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,920
it was fascinating about the character

2120
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,798
i like the idea too that he really feels

2121
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:38,079
and he really in his heart feels he's

2122
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,119
doing right

2123
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,679
you know he really feels he's on the

2124
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,317
side of right

2125
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,480
almost like well i should say some sort

2126
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,559
of religious uh

2127
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,159
zealot let's say who uh will

2128
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:53,679
well they're really intent on converting

2129
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:55,519
you even if it's gonna kill you

2130
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,798
i see and that was the uh fascination i

2131
01:07:58,798 --> 01:07:59,358
had with

2132
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:01,440
with uh travis you know in order to make

2133
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,119
that movie at that time i felt that

2134
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,760
travis is a part of all of us i really

2135
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,639
do

2136
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:09,760
and some people have have it

2137
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,280
under control some people are not even

2138
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,599
aware of it now i don't know

2139
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,039
i know enough now to know that i don't

2140
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,158
know uh travis um

2141
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,319
at the time is like seemed to be a part

2142
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,399
of all of us i i felt

2143
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,479
i felt and he acts out he acts out his

2144
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,000
fantasies and i guess that's the

2145
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,679
definition of somebody who goes crazy

2146
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:28,960
which will have fantasies but he

2147
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,039
literally acts them out he

2148
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:33,679
goes over that edge and especially the

2149
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:34,399
scene i guess

2150
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,439
the ritualism of of

2151
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,079
building the gun rack on his arm and

2152
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:41,759
putting the knife on his on his boot

2153
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,479
and uh preparing for some sort of urban

2154
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:45,759
guerrilla combat

2155
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,759
with the forces of evil in the streets i

2156
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:48,880
mean like batman

2157
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,279
you know i mean uh i mean as a the

2158
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,798
batman character in the new film is he

2159
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:53,600
crazy well

2160
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,279
he kind of acts that way when he says

2161
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,640
who he says batman

2162
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,600
in any event it's it's yeah it's uh it's

2163
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,960
somebody who's acting out the fantasies

2164
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,679
and i guess

2165
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,600
in that respect he is like all of us

2166
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,039
only he acts them out

2167
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:07,679
and watch this shot here remember now he

2168
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,920
walks towards

2169
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,920
the fella who takes care of the place

2170
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,600
but now he's put on a dolly in this next

2171
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,079
cut

2172
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:15,198
this one he's on a dolly and he's

2173
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:16,960
floating in the air towards him and his

2174
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,238
jump cut right to it

2175
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,238
yeah i'm just gonna say that what

2176
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,759
strikes me is

2177
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,399
how many of the camera moves how many

2178
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,399
how so many of the camera moves

2179
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,600
are reminiscent of horror films

2180
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,719
more than thrillers horror films i

2181
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,158
like horror films a great deal you look

2182
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,000
at the slow tracking cameras

2183
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,640
in the horror films classic example is

2184
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,838
mark robson's

2185
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:41,679
isle of the dead in which the camera

2186
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,880
tracks into a

2187
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,119
coffin the woman's been buried alive in

2188
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:47,039
the coffin they thought she was dead

2189
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:48,960
but such a slow track in isle of the

2190
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,000
dead was a picture that scared the hell

2191
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,960
out of me actually

2192
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,479
i saw it twice when i was a kid but i

2193
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,319
always i always got too frightened to

2194
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:55,198
stay in the theater

2195
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:57,600
uh in one sequence where the woman gets

2196
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,719
out of the coffin and

2197
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,319
starts killing everybody around her

2198
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:02,158
because they had buried her and she

2199
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:06,479
and she uh uh she had a disease in which

2200
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:08,319
when she stopped breathing she thought

2201
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:09,520
people thought that she was dead you

2202
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,479
know

2203
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:11,520
and there was a plague on the island

2204
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,960
it's a beautiful film but the value

2205
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,719
produced it

2206
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:18,158
and it reminds me of those moves

2207
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,399
this is an example too where we finally

2208
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:22,079
just stopped moving the camera

2209
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:23,279
i always thought jody was wonderful in

2210
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:24,719
this just listening to him with those

2211
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:25,520
glasses

2212
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,279
and pouring that sugar on sugar on the

2213
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:31,279
jam she's just very cool

2214
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:34,079
she's great jodie foster landed her

2215
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:36,238
first major part in martin scorsese's

2216
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:37,760
1974 film

2217
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,079
alice doesn't live here anymore with

2218
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:42,158
such roles as a teenage hustler and tom

2219
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:42,719
sawyer

2220
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,560
and the daring audrey in alice doesn't

2221
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,760
live here anymore

2222
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,760
foster was a young star who never played

2223
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,760
this sweet innocent child

2224
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,920
jody foster showed her appreciation for

2225
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,079
scorsese's foresight in casting her for

2226
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:56,319
the part of iris in a card entitled

2227
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:00,319
gracie merci danka she wrote to him

2228
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:02,158
i would like to thank you for making all

2229
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:04,000
of my success possible

2230
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,840
if it wasn't for you i would probably be

2231
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,840
on the mickey mouse club until i was 30

2232
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,279
years old

2233
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:10,479
i think she only shot a few weeks in

2234
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:12,880
this about a couple of weeks that's all

2235
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,800
it was a little hard because we had the

2236
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
teacher on the set

2237
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,158
she was still i think at that time she

2238
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:20,238
was 12 years old

2239
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:22,640
well she looks much older here so with

2240
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,840
the teacher we can only shoot certain

2241
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,319
hours a day

2242
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:27,760
i got into a real problem when we tried

2243
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,760
to do our high angle shot down through

2244
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,679
the building at the end

2245
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,560
a lot of technical problems kept us late

2246
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,439
and um

2247
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:37,920
we were we only had we prepared for that

2248
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,039
shot for over three months we cut

2249
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:40,000
through the ceiling

2250
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,760
cut through everything and laid tracks

2251
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,359
down and took three months to do

2252
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,800
and then we had literally 20 minutes to

2253
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,039
get it 20 minutes that was it

2254
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:50,000
now this scene was improvised by harvey

2255
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,880
and jody

2256
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,719
and we thought we put it in paul agreed

2257
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,158
to it and we put it in

2258
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:56,800
um it is one of the few scenes that

2259
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,840
really

2260
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,399
travis is not a witness to even though

2261
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,520
he's outside he's outside the building

2262
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,760
in the original script every single

2263
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,840
scene

2264
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,319
travis is in every scene you do not see

2265
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:12,000
the world from anybody else's point of

2266
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,880
view

2267
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,479
you know you cannot see the world from

2268
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:15,760
anybody else's point of view because the

2269
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,640
moment you do

2270
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,840
he looks quite ridiculous so marty

2271
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,679
wanted two scenes

2272
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,399
added he wanted one for albert brooks

2273
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:25,920
which i wrote which was with albert

2274
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,439
brooks and the politician

2275
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:29,439
and then he won one for harry kaitel

2276
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,880
which i wrote which was with

2277
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,238
harvey and jody foster

2278
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:36,000
i disagree with him i said you cannot

2279
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,679
have a scene in this movie that travis

2280
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:38,560
is not in

2281
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,399
because the moment you do you give the

2282
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:42,000
audience a chance

2283
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,679
to see that there's a normal world out

2284
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,359
there and therefore you get outside of

2285
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:47,119
his head

2286
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:49,679
and uh and in the end he did cut out the

2287
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:50,158
one

2288
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:52,960
with albert brooks and the politician

2289
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,238
but he left in the one

2290
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:56,479
with harvey and jody but he cut it in

2291
01:12:56,479 --> 01:12:57,920
such a way

2292
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,439
reusing the shot from another part of

2293
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:01,198
the film so it looks like bob's looking

2294
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:02,479
at the window

2295
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:06,000
you know so it at least is tied into

2296
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,760
the notion that that the taxi driver

2297
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,719
is in some way observing this event but

2298
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,319
i thought it was really important to

2299
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:15,359
to have the scene i thought it was a

2300
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:17,520
really important thing in terms of

2301
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,679
the relationship between her and sport

2302
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:20,640
to show that

2303
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,319
she's not being held there against her

2304
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:24,560
will and to show that this is her family

2305
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,359
at this point

2306
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,880
this is what it is whatever shape or

2307
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,679
form unfortunately that it is

2308
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,800
you know to show that he doesn't beat

2309
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,920
her it doesn't drag her it's it's

2310
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:34,719
whatever

2311
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,040
whatever

2312
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,198
the two shots that preceded this the

2313
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:40,560
shadow travis and the cab and the shot

2314
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,760
tilting up the building

2315
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,198
were taken from other sequences in the

2316
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:44,640
film in other words i hadn't been

2317
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,000
planned in my mind i hadn't seen

2318
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,119
it in my mind and put it on paper and

2319
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:51,599
therefore

2320
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,439
may not have been the best way of going

2321
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:57,919
about it

2322
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,600
now it's it's uh you know it's a

2323
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,600
compliment to paul schrader because

2324
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,359
anything we tried to put in it could

2325
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:07,039
only be in for anything that wasn't in

2326
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,079
the script that we try to

2327
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:10,399
that we try to slip in uh it can only be

2328
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:12,238
in for uh

2329
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:14,880
for a few seconds or very very little

2330
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,158
time could it could it be held you know

2331
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:16,719
because the

2332
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,239
script was so tight you know

2333
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,198
so now you're back to actual scripted

2334
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:25,519
shots

2335
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,520
shots that i drew and

2336
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,198
usually envision them in a cutting

2337
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:32,640
pattern too so that you saw those cuts

2338
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,359
it's all

2339
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,157
worked out that way

2340
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,238
again more ritual military

2341
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:44,800
ritual in this case but keeping himself

2342
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,158
in perfect shape and

2343
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:48,079
cleaning his boots and you know still

2344
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,039
the dead flowers in the background

2345
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:52,079
it doesn't have a heart to throw them

2346
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,960
away he was so hurt

2347
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,399
but he'll burn them because it's uh

2348
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,000
more purifying to burn them you know

2349
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,560
the more ritualistic i think now because

2350
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,520
he has the mission

2351
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,760
he can burn away he can burn um

2352
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,960
burn um betsy away in a sense

2353
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,198
i always imagine these uh i was like

2354
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:16,560
scenes of ritual

2355
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,560
uh preparation before going out it

2356
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,158
reminds me the virgin spring for example

2357
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:21,198
before he kills

2358
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:22,719
before max vancito character kills the

2359
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,399
three boys who raped his daughter he

2360
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,000
goes into the um

2361
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,399
um there's like a sauna there and he

2362
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,920
goes in and whips himself with the

2363
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,039
branches to clean himself he cleanses

2364
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:34,560
himself before he performs the ritual

2365
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,840
act of murder

2366
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,840
well valentine at that time was sort of

2367
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,920
like we were hoping uh

2368
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,760
um again going back to the tragedy of

2369
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,960
of the road the country took and the

2370
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,479
assassinations from like from november

2371
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:49,840
63 on

2372
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,520
was the loss of all the great

2373
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,880
potentially great potentially great

2374
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,520
leaders

2375
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,840
because we they had the promise you know

2376
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,319
and a lot of them seem to be

2377
01:15:58,319 --> 01:15:59,840
which is a word i think now is supposed

2378
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,840
to be a dirty word but liberal

2379
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,238
and i think uh valentine represented a

2380
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:05,439
liberal

2381
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:07,359
uh candidate he couldn't care less if he

2382
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,279
was liberal or conservative

2383
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:10,960
travis travis couldn't care less no he

2384
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,039
had to do something to make himself to

2385
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:14,079
make his force

2386
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:18,158
power known you know and uh

2387
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:20,399
he had to try to change things even if

2388
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:21,600
it was

2389
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,840
with a political candidate he had he had

2390
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,960
no

2391
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,760
he had no interest in really and the

2392
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,119
fact that he couldn't kill the candidate

2393
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:29,359
or

2394
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:31,760
wound him or maim or whatever he just on

2395
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,198
second thought i think i'll go kill trav

2396
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:34,158
i'll go kill

2397
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:35,679
second thought i think i'll go kill

2398
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,479
sport and the guy who takes care of uh

2399
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:39,920
the whorehouse and

2400
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,039
kill as many people as possible don't

2401
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:42,719
kill myself but as you can see he has no

2402
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,880
bullets left

2403
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,119
that was his screw-up

2404
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:50,479
i think a few years earlier in columbus

2405
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:53,279
circle joe columbo was shot

2406
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:56,319
and i thought it was interesting to to

2407
01:16:56,319 --> 01:16:59,600
to have well

2408
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,880
now we see the uh

2409
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,479
the camera tracks up it doesn't tilt up

2410
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:05,920
it tracks up i remember here

2411
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,760
where he takes another pill and we see

2412
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,159
the uh

2413
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:16,560
we see the new the new look that he has

2414
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,600
it reminded me i mean the sense it had a

2415
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,679
vibrancy because of that to me that it

2416
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,800
was a place where

2417
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,039
there was bloodshed a few years earlier

2418
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:26,560
in such a public area

2419
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,359
and such an unfortunate situation for

2420
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:30,560
the earlier 12 years

2421
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,600
the direction our country was being

2422
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,960
taken don't like somebody who killed him

2423
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,079
thought it was important to have it in a

2424
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,359
place where such a thing

2425
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,760
had occurred because of the tragedy

2426
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,238
of what's happened in our country since

2427
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:43,520
1963.

2428
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,960
it's like having it in a place where

2429
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,719
it's

2430
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,359
been already um consecrated in a way by

2431
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:53,600
by blood whether it's innocent or guilty

2432
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,800
we're not to judge but what i'm saying

2433
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,399
is that such a tragedy also occurred

2434
01:17:56,399 --> 01:17:56,800
there

2435
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,119
a few years earlier but it's very very

2436
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:00,560
important to have it in a place like

2437
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,600
that because of

2438
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,719
what had happened since 1963 between jfk

2439
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,039
and bob bobby kennedy and malcolm x and

2440
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:08,158
malcolm x was even before

2441
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:11,520
jfk uh so many so many of the great

2442
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,560
leaders uh

2443
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,359
uh killed uh frank warner is the man who

2444
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:16,158
supervised

2445
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:17,920
who's the uh supervisor actually did the

2446
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,439
sound effects in this film

2447
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:20,640
uh we really had a good time working

2448
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,000
together with him later on a raging bull

2449
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,560
where

2450
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,158
where he uh uh i think he did such a

2451
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:27,279
wonderful job of

2452
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:28,800
sound effects and sound effects cutting

2453
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,119
and the use of uh

2454
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:32,880
each punch for example a raging bull was

2455
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,800
a different sound was either an orange

2456
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,640
being crushed or a watermelon being

2457
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,360
punched or uh

2458
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,319
i don't know why i mean and finally for

2459
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:43,679
example each

2460
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,439
uh flash bulb going off with different

2461
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:47,679
sounds rifle shots

2462
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,479
symbols uh garbage pail covers slammed

2463
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:51,198
together

2464
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:52,800
and i remember people wanted to know

2465
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,640
what he used specifically where but i

2466
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:54,960
believe

2467
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,560
what he always answered that he burned

2468
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,000
his special effects afterwards

2469
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:58,960
sound effects because he didn't want

2470
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,840
anybody else using them so um

2471
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,198
this is this this marked our first

2472
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:04,719
collaboration with him and he was he had

2473
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:05,840
done the sound effects also for close

2474
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,079
encounters of the third kind

2475
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:09,520
i always like these moves that bob does

2476
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,600
with his head it's sort of like

2477
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,679
reminds me of the animated king kong

2478
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,479
like 1933 you know

2479
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,880
this is another shot where which we took

2480
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,198
which but this was actually scripted

2481
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:22,960
where travis isn't actually there but we

2482
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,479
see what's happening he's not actually

2483
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:25,520
the witness so i thought we could

2484
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,960
because of stuff like this that we could

2485
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,560
violate that structure that paul had

2486
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,399
um uh so that we could use that scene

2487
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,000
that was shown earlier between harvey

2488
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,479
and

2489
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:34,880
jody foster dancing i may be wrong maybe

2490
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,079
maybe right i'm not quite sure i still

2491
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:37,600
don't know

2492
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,198
notice a lot of the sound effects are

2493
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:41,520
taken away here because bernard herman

2494
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,719
when we're doing the mix he was there

2495
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:43,920
and he says what's all that noise over

2496
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,039
my music

2497
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:47,760
get that out especially over that that

2498
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,520
tambourine now here's where we begin

2499
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,399
here's where we begin the um contrast

2500
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:53,198
effect of the

2501
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:55,920
this looks pretty good by the way this

2502
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,238
is pretty much what i wanted

2503
01:19:58,238 --> 01:19:59,679
we begin to like what i did was i

2504
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:01,279
started printing from this point on on

2505
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,719
high contrast or

2506
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,158
printing from an into from from an

2507
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:05,920
actual positive print

2508
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,439
so we went several generations and we

2509
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:10,637
made a grainier how's everything

2510
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:14,079
some of this was improvised and it was

2511
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:15,439
very very important to get this all in

2512
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:16,719
one shot

2513
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:19,359
in one take with no cuts for this reason

2514
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:20,800
that when he shoots harvey

2515
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,359
it's it's it's really a street shooting

2516
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:24,800
in the sense where you could be looking

2517
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,679
you can be across the street and you

2518
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:26,560
watch these two guys and something

2519
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,920
another guy pulls a gun and he fires at

2520
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:28,479
him

2521
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:29,600
you don't see any close-up of a gun

2522
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,760
coming out and also the flipping of the

2523
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,960
cigarette

2524
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,880
at his chest which he does soon right

2525
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,399
here i think

2526
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:40,000
yeah and and the sparks and the kick

2527
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,840
stuck on this and that's a scripted line

2528
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,600
of dialogue suck on this that's paul

2529
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,960
paul's line it was so wonderful i

2530
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,800
thought and again

2531
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,238
the camera just calmly tracks back with

2532
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:50,479
him bob had this idea he said

2533
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,760
instead of going back in the building

2534
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,119
maybe i should just go and sit down for

2535
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:54,238
a second

2536
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:56,560
i said yeah that's great almost as if

2537
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,399
he's going to change his mind

2538
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:00,719
and the woman in the tv and uh had on a

2539
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,399
film on tv was late show playing

2540
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:03,760
they were showing a dub version of

2541
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,359
visconti's rock on his brothers one of

2542
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:06,800
my very favorite films so

2543
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,399
he decides he's going to go back in and

2544
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:09,520
go through with the plan sort of like

2545
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,319
the avenging angel

2546
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,800
naturally we had some difficulty with

2547
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,238
the mpaa

2548
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:18,799
for our rating

2549
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:24,238
and uh aside from the two shots i

2550
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:26,719
discussed earlier about trimming

2551
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:27,840
i found that i couldn't really trim

2552
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,000
anymore which they wanted me to

2553
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,400
so what i did was i

2554
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,000
was inspired by

2555
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,198
the work that john houston and jack

2556
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:42,238
cardiff for

2557
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:44,000
jack hilliard i'm not quite sure who did

2558
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,800
that who was the cinematographer on um

2559
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,238
oswald morris uh who

2560
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:51,840
one of those i think morris was the

2561
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,238
cinematographer on moby dick

2562
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:56,800
in the early 50s or mid 50s i think 55

2563
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,920
56

2564
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,079
that john houston uh and his

2565
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:01,600
cinematography used a technique

2566
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,840
in which he shot the film with of course

2567
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,639
at that time three strip technicolor

2568
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:10,399
and was able to fuse black and white and

2569
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:11,600
color

2570
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,238
together in a different a different

2571
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:15,840
ratio in each shot

2572
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,600
so that it had the effect of it almost

2573
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,439
being a hand tinted film

2574
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:24,079
a lot of the prints that that were made

2575
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:25,439
subsequent to that that you see for

2576
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:27,600
example moby dick on television now

2577
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,119
or you buy the tape now it's full

2578
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:30,719
technicolor it's that's not

2579
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:31,760
that's not the way the film was

2580
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,238
originally released and he actually

2581
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:35,600
employed this technique a little bit in

2582
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,359
moulin rouge originally in early 50

2583
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:39,039
51-52 when he made that

2584
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:41,520
but moby dick he really did it as as as

2585
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,479
a style

2586
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,719
and i thought that would be the way

2587
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:51,119
to um uh settle with the mpaa

2588
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:54,560
by diffusing the color of the sequence

2589
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,158
at the end of the film

2590
01:22:56,158 --> 01:22:58,880
and in so doing since we weren't

2591
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,399
shooting three strip technicolor anymore

2592
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:01,439
of course you're only shooting eastman

2593
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:02,319
color at the time

2594
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:04,639
and still today you what you we had to

2595
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,560
do would be to

2596
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,960
make an optical of each shot so that in

2597
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,600
each shot

2598
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,639
i could take i would have

2599
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,399
the choice of let's say one shot

2600
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,158
of changing the ratio from color to

2601
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:20,238
black and white in each shot so that you

2602
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:21,119
would have the choice

2603
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:22,479
in the first shot you say okay in this

2604
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:24,639
shot i wanted to have you also had to

2605
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:25,359
have a base

2606
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:27,039
of color because it was printed on color

2607
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:28,800
stock so it had to have either green

2608
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,399
base or brown base and i chose the brown

2609
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:32,079
base most of the time

2610
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:32,960
that's why it has a little bit of a

2611
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,800
sepia feeling to it each one of those

2612
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,238
each one of the shots in that sequence

2613
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:38,158
i said okay and shot number one uh what

2614
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:40,079
do you want 40 colors 60

2615
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:42,238
color uh what do you want and i would

2616
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:44,319
say well okay shot number one let's say

2617
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:45,920
i don't have the specifics of that with

2618
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,600
me and now but let's say

2619
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,319
shot number one is 60 column 40 black

2620
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:50,800
and white

2621
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,319
and the next one because it has certain

2622
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,158
shadows in it it's going to be too much

2623
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:55,039
in black and white

2624
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:56,960
so make it 80 color and 20 black and

2625
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,639
white and the next one a close-up of the

2626
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,158
blood flying out or whatever

2627
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:02,158
let's take away some of that that candy

2628
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:03,840
color of the red

2629
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,039
of the blood by making it um

2630
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:10,719
30 color and 70 black and white so that

2631
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:14,079
it's almost as if you had that you had

2632
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:16,238
you actually had that you have the

2633
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:17,119
choice you can you can

2634
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:18,719
you can actually you have the ability to

2635
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,719
do this

2636
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,319
almost done you almost have the ability

2637
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:24,238
to do this let's say on watching

2638
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:26,319
a color tv and you could take that color

2639
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:27,760
knob

2640
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,399
and take the color out and you can leave

2641
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:31,840
it halfway

2642
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,960
and you have the effect that i was

2643
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,359
trying to get and the color knob is sort

2644
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:36,719
of between halfway color and halfway

2645
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:37,760
black and white

2646
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,359
and that's the kind of effect that

2647
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:42,000
houston had achieved in uh

2648
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,600
in moby dick although i thought it was

2649
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,039
much better

2650
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:46,158
and we'll be dick because he was using

2651
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:47,359
the three strip technicolor and he had

2652
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:48,719
more control

2653
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,158
um you can really do it like a little

2654
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:52,238
painting each frame

2655
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:55,359
and and this way we worked everything

2656
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:56,719
out with the sensors and also it gave

2657
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,520
the film at that point

2658
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,520
because it was made from an optical it

2659
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,439
was more contrasty and at that point

2660
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:04,880
it gave the picture a feeling i really

2661
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,238
wanted all the way through which was the

2662
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:08,238
look of a tabloid

2663
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:10,560
of a daily news when i grew up the daily

2664
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,920
news there was a daily news in the daily

2665
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,520
mirror which were tabloids

2666
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,039
and usually on the front page every

2667
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:16,560
other day there was a photo of a dead

2668
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,560
body in the street uh after a robbery

2669
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,359
you know and that sort of thing uh the

2670
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:22,079
robber uh

2671
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:23,840
the alleged robber killed in the street

2672
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,119
alleged killer killed in the street and

2673
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:25,679
that sort of thing

2674
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:26,880
i remember the look of the blood was of

2675
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,079
course it was black and white like ouija

2676
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:29,198
photographs you know

2677
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:31,679
only more contrasty and it gave a sense

2678
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,279
of um

2679
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:38,000
tabloid realism that i wanted to get uh

2680
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,880
in that sequence in the picture actually

2681
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,439
thinking backwards on the whole thing

2682
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:45,119
going back to the very conception of the

2683
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:48,238
movie when i first read the script

2684
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:49,359
i'd imagine that the picture should be

2685
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:51,920
done in black and white uh because of

2686
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,399
the

2687
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:54,560
sense of the homage to the noir films i

2688
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,000
was talking about earlier

2689
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,439
but then you know we had to use color

2690
01:25:57,439 --> 01:25:58,719
it's a selling point especially in the

2691
01:25:58,719 --> 01:25:59,920
early 70s at that time everything was

2692
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,039
made in color

2693
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:02,479
and so i tried to design as much as

2694
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:04,560
possible in black and white but you know

2695
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,319
really have a yellow taxicab it's it's a

2696
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:08,000
problem so uh

2697
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,238
um

2698
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:12,960
my second choice was to try to do the

2699
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,560
entire film in the method i described

2700
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,600
just now

2701
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,600
which was to diffuse the color with

2702
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,198
black and white and change the

2703
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:22,560
ratio in each shot of course that's even

2704
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,600
more expensive than

2705
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,359
i think that's more expensive because

2706
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:27,039
each shot had to be made from an optical

2707
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:28,238
and therefore you have an interpositive

2708
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:30,238
at the end uh one the entire shootout

2709
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:31,600
sequence isn't into positive

2710
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,039
it starts with the one i pointed out

2711
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:34,960
with his car tr his cab

2712
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,319
pulling up and him getting out of the

2713
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:37,920
cab and going over and talking to uh

2714
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,600
sport and then killing sport

2715
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,679
that the color was slightly taken out of

2716
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,119
that shot you can see the difference

2717
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:44,800
slightly taken out maybe

2718
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,600
80 color 20 black and white there but

2719
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,800
what's important there is that

2720
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,439
it cuts to a more grainy image and that

2721
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:52,399
it was done

2722
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:53,760
contrasting that way on purpose it was

2723
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,760
printed from i believe some sort of

2724
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,279
positive image that we had

2725
01:26:57,279 --> 01:26:59,039
um i remember dan perry helping us with

2726
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:00,560
that on he doesn't want to do the titles

2727
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,359
for us

2728
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:03,279
and him suggesting what to print it on

2729
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:04,560
to get that graininess

2730
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,399
and uh it gives another feeling it gives

2731
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:07,520
it like going into another world i

2732
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,639
wanted the whole film to look like that

2733
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:09,359
originally

2734
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:12,238
but then i i gave that up and and shot

2735
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:13,119
it straight

2736
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:14,880
and reverted back to it at the end as a

2737
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,719
way of getting of uh

2738
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,238
working things out with the the motion

2739
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:19,920
picture associated association of

2740
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,439
america because of the

2741
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:23,600
heavy censorship that was being

2742
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,279
threatened on the film

2743
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:27,920
evoking impassioned responses this

2744
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:28,560
bloodbath

2745

01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:02,319
pauline kale wrote some people who are

2762
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:03,600
angered by the film

2763
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,920
will say that it advocates violence as a

2764
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,760
cure for frustration

2765
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,279
but to acknowledge that when a

2766
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:11,600
psychopath's blood boils over he may

2767
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,399
cool down

2768
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:14,639
is not the same as justifying the

2769
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:15,840
eruption

2770
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,520
this film doesn't operate on the level

2771
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,560
of moral judgment of what travis does

2772
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,960
rather by drawing us into his vortex it

2773
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,719
makes us understand the psychic

2774
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,880
discharge of the quiet boys who go

2775
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,439
berserk

2776
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:32,880
director michael powell wrote i've heard

2777
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,800
people whine about the violence in mean

2778
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,439
streets the violence in taxi driver

2779
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:40,399
scorsese is an artist pick up a copy of

2780
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:43,359
disasters of war see that naked maimed

2781
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:44,319
figure of a man

2782
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,880
impaled on a stake see those tumbled

2783
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,359
women

2784
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:48,960
raped and murdered see that priest

2785
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,639
hanged from a tree do you think that

2786
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,479
goya was trying to get a cheap thrill

2787
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:53,920
out of these horrors

2788
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,639
no more is martin scorsese he has an eye

2789
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:58,000
that misses nothing

2790
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
that looks on beauty and terror with the

2791
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,600
same dispassionate eye

2792
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,238
with the same love and compassion he

2793
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,960
cannot tell anything but the truth

2794
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,158
i've had some sort of criticism from

2795
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:10,238
time to time about the fact that uh

2796
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:11,600
that he wouldn't be in any trouble with

2797
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,439
the police but

2798
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:15,600
you know the way i always imagine it new

2799
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,000
york or organized crime in any way

2800
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,960
this guy has done that

2801
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:22,639
he goes into a place and he winds up

2802
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,520
killing a couple of lower echelon

2803
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,198
guys where we aren't even in organized

2804
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:28,880
crime but maybe owned the place might be

2805
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,238
owned by somebody who is

2806
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:31,920
a big shot and that's all worked out and

2807
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,439
they hush it all up and they want to get

2808
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:34,399
rid of them anyway and

2809
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:35,520
everything's quiet and the guy there's

2810
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,880
no charges pressed of any kind and he

2811
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,238
comes out a hero

2812
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:40,000
there's stranger things as we know have

2813
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,880
happened in this city so

2814
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,679
so uh never once did did i feel that

2815
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:46,319
that was

2816
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:49,600
in any way um questionable

2817
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,520
some people some people in england in

2818
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,719
europe particularly

2819
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,319
in england or europe say gee you know he

2820
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:56,960
didn't get any trouble well no

2821
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,279
the irony of him becoming a hero is is

2822
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:00,960
in the script

2823
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,319
uh you know godard once said that

2824
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:06,238
every good film becomes commercially

2825
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:08,800
successful for the wrong reasons

2826
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,880
um and uh and i suspect that's

2827
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,079
some truth in this case as well you know

2828
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:18,560
there were a part of his commercial

2829
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,198
success

2830
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:21,679
was for the wrong reasons you know but i

2831
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:22,399
think that

2832
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:25,920
uh that's the way it is in pop culture

2833
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,560
you know you

2834
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,880
uh you have to sort of take with one

2835
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,279
hand and give the other

2836
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,399
and that the the element of the film

2837
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:37,279
that uh caters to violence is

2838
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:38,479
counterpointed by

2839
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:40,800
the element of the film that shows

2840
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,158
violence to be

2841
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:44,238
genuinely psychotic and this character

2842
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,158
to be psychotic

2843
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:49,840
things seem calmer in him now and uh yet

2844
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:53,198
um those looks

2845
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:56,000
see i look like that that's why i put

2846
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,279
that in because

2847
01:30:57,279 --> 01:30:59,439
there's no such thing as a guy like this

2848
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:01,520
staying calm for too long

2849
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,000
you know especially that look and those

2850
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,719
eyes

2851
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:08,399
again from the michael powell influencer

2852
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:09,679
if you look at all the moves and robert

2853
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,439
helpman and tales of hoffman

2854
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:13,600
you'll see those those those those angle

2855
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,039
and that that feeling i think i hope

2856
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:16,399
you'll see maybe i see it maybe nobody

2857
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:17,439
else sees it i don't know but it winds

2858
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:17,920
up here

2859
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,719
what can i say and at the end of it i

2860
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,639
decided i put something on

2861
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:25,520
that shows that the time the timer

2862
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,639
starts to

2863
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,319
tick again right about

2864
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:33,679
the timer in uh in travis the one that's

2865
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:34,719
about to explode

2866
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:36,800
the bomb starts to tick again right

2867
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,600
about here let me show you

2868
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:45,520
right here

2869
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,198
as if you saw something in the mirror

2870
01:31:47,198 --> 01:31:49,039
and you hear that little uh sting

2871
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:50,560
that goes backwards there that was the

2872
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,319
last thing bernard herman did for us

2873
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:54,000
i said i said i need a little something

2874
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,319
on there um on there uh

2875
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:57,359
on the moment when she looks into the

2876
01:31:57,359 --> 01:31:59,198
mirror he said you want to sting and he

2877
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:01,039
played it on the xylophone

2878
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:02,639
tom scott i think was there and they had

2879
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,238
the little group do it

2880
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:06,479
and i see but it sounds too sounds too

2881
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:08,079
normal i said it sounds too

2882
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:09,279
i don't care for it that much just play

2883
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:11,198
it backwards and he walked out i try to

2884
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:12,639
stay as much as possible

2885
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:15,679
with the ad campaign to the picture

2886
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,158
the trailer yeah very much so i try to

2887
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:20,000
stay

2888
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,119
with the actual release of the picture

2889
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:24,880
and even do as much publicity as

2890
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,479
possible under the circumstances for the

2891
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:27,279
film

2892
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:30,399
and uh i am you know

2893
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:32,800
very much involved but of course you

2894
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,399
know they it's usually

2895
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:37,600
they are that's really their

2896
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,439
expertise in most cases now granted

2897
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:42,960
sometimes a certain regime at a certain

2898
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,399
studio may not be the best for a certain

2899
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:45,520
kind of film that i'm making at that

2900
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,158
point

2901
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:47,840
you don't know it all depends it all

2902
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,520
depends on luck too depends on certain

2903
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,800
kinds of people certain studios that i'm

2904
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,000
making the film for

2905
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,279
could release the kind of film i make

2906
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:55,679
perfectly for that year you know

2907
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,800
um other types wouldn't be interested in

2908
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,639
i always said i always said that for me

2909
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:01,920
going to the movies i mean when i was a

2910
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:02,319
kid

2911
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:04,158
when i was when i was young when i was a

2912
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:06,238
child because of the

2913
01:33:06,238 --> 01:33:08,560
physical problems of having asthma and

2914
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,679
everything i didn't play sports

2915
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:11,039
so i'd always go to the movie theater or

2916
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:13,198
to uh church and

2917
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:17,039
and uh um in both cases

2918
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:18,560
it was being the church was something

2919
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,639
very special and the mass and all the

2920
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:21,600
religious ritual

2921
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,960
and you would have you would have a

2922
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,238
sense of being in a special place and

2923
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:25,840
time would stop

2924
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,840
and and same in the movie theater the

2925
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,920
same when a film was really quite

2926
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,439
magic the film was magical you'd lose

2927
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:34,479
yourself in the film

2928
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:37,840
and become like a dream state and then

2929
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,880
you'd be

2930
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,439
really shocked when you come out

2931
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:42,479
especially if you were there in the

2932
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:44,158
afternoon you came out in bright

2933
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:46,560
summer afternoon the white light would

2934
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,319
hit you

2935
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:50,079
as the final credits play out we would

2936
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:52,079
like to express our gratitude to martin

2937
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:53,760
scorsese and paul schrader

2938
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,079
for sharing their insights we hope they

2939
01:33:56,079 --> 01:33:58,079
have enriched your appreciation for this

2940
01:33:58,079 --> 01:33:59,279
classic
