1
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,124
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,338
So what do you wanna hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,006
I can't sIeep nights.

4
00:02:35,257 --> 00:02:38,969
- There's porno theaters for that. - I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:45,267
So what do you do now?

6
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:49,354
Now? Ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses.

7
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,399
Figure I might as weII get paid for it.

8
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,943
You wanna work uptown? South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,903
I'II work anytime, anywhere.

10
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:58,488
Will you work Jewish holidays?

11
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:00,448
Anytime, anywhere.

12
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:03,159
Let me see your chauffeur's Iicense.

13
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:06,913
How's your record?

14
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:08,206
It's cIean.

15
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:10,458
It's reaI cIean, Iike my conscience.

16
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,504
You gonna break my chops? I got enough troubIe with guys Iike you.

17
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:17,549
If you're gonna, you can take it on the arches.

18
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,677
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that.

19
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,055
- PhysicaI? - CIean.

20
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:26,057
- Age? - 26.

21
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,976
Education?

22
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:29,644
Some.

23
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:31,938
Here, there.

24
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,235
Military record?

25
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,654
Honorable discharge.

26
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:42,157
May 1973.

27
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:44,367
- Were you in the Army? - Marines.

28
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:48,621
I was in the Marines too.

29
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,001
So what is it?

30
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:55,295
You need an extra job?

31
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,797
Are you moonlighting?

32
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,801
Well, I just wanna work long hours.

33
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:03,470
What's moonlighting?

34
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:04,888
Look...

35
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,682
...just fill these out and check back tomorrow.

36
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:10,810
O'Brien, please step up.

37
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,563
Take the car out through 58th Street, please.

38
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:15,607
Because it's crowded on 57th.

39
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,872
<i>May 10th.</i>

40
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,000
<i>Thank God for the rain, which washed away...</i>

41
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,836
<i>... the garbage and the trash off the sidewalks.</i>

42
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:21,631
<i>I'm working long hours now.</i>

43
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,635
<i>Six in the afternoon to six in the morning, sometimes even eight.</i>

44
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:28,972
<i>Six days a week, sometimes seven days a week.</i>

45
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:32,100
<i>It's a long hustle, but it keeps me real busy.</i>

46
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,561
<i>I can take in $300, $350 a week.</i>

47
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:37,355
<i>Sometimes even more, when I do it off the meter.</i>

48
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:04,799
<i>All the animals come out at night.</i>

49
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:10,054
<i>Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.</i>

50
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:13,224
<i>Sick, venal.</i>

51
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:20,815
<i>Someday, a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.</i>

52
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:32,785
<i>I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, Harlem.</i>

53
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:35,955
<i>I don't care. Don't make no difference to me.</i>

54
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:39,751
<i>It does to some. Some won't even take spooks.</i>

55
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:41,544
<i>Don't make no difference to me.</i>

56
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:43,379
48th and 6th, please.

57
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:47,675
Man, you are gorgeous! BeautifuI IittIe girI.

58
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:52,472
I can't afford to get stopped.

59
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,849
We wouldn't want that to happen.

60
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,770
There'II be a big tip for you if you do the right things.

61
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:00,897
You got a way.

62
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:02,565
You got a way.

63
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,235
Now you're talking!

64
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:08,946
Driver, hurry up, will you?

65
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:51,697
<i>Each night when I return the cab, I clean the come off the back seat.</i>

66
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,996
<i>Some nights, I clean off the blood.</i>

67
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:33,864
Can I heIp you?

68
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,117
Yeah, what's your name?

69
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:37,702
My name is Travis.

70
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,705
That's nice. What can I do for you?

71
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:44,458
I'd Iike to know what your name is.

72
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:47,003
Gimme a break.

73
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:51,132
You can tell me what your name is. I'm not gonna do anything.

74
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:54,927
- Do you want me to call the manager? - You don't have to--

75
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:56,095
Troy!

76
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:58,639
AII right. Okay, I mean...

77
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,019
Can I have a ChuckIes there?

78
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:08,316
Do you have any Jujus? They Iast Ionger. I'd Iike to get them too.

79
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:10,735
What you see is what we got.

80
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:21,370
I'II take these.

81
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,207
Coca-Cola.

82
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:29,295
We don't have Coca-Cola. Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

83
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,631
A dollar eighty-five.

84
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,074
<i>Twelve hours of work and I still can't sleep.</i>

85
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:00,201
<i>Damn.</i>

86
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:04,497
<i>Days go on and on. And they don't end.</i>

87
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:09,376
<i>All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go.</i>

88
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:13,964
<i>I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention.</i>

89
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:17,510
<i>I believe someone should become a person like other people.</i>

90
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:24,809
<i>I first saw her at Palantine campaign headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.</i>

91
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:28,771
<i>She was wearing a white dress.</i>

92
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:31,440
<i>She appeared like an angel...</i>

93
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,568
<i>... out of this filthy mass.</i>

94
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:36,654
<i>She is alone.</i>

95
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:39,365
<i>They...</i>

96
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,242
<i>... cannot...</i>

97
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,119
<i>... touch...</i>

98
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:45,204
<i>...her.</i>

99
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:02,555
You delivered two boxes. I think it's a total of 5000 campaign buttons.

100
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:06,100
Now, all the ones we had before and our slogan is...

101
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,019
..."We are the people," and "are" is underlined.

102
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,730
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

103
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:16,527
<i>That reads, " We are the people." Well, I think there's a difference.</i>

104
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:20,656
<i>"We are the people" is not the same as " We are the people."</i>

105
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:22,950
Let's not fight.

106
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,870
Look, we'II make it reaI simpIe.

107
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,205
<i>We don't pay for the buttons.</i>

108
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:32,751
<i>- We throw the buttons away, all right? - Tom, come here a minute.</i>

109
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,671
What?

110
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,975
If Andy okays this canvass report, send a copy to aII headquarters.

111
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:50,477
<i>I gotta xerox that New York Times articIe.</i>

112
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,230
- Don't forget the new photos. - I didn't.

113
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:57,693
We have to emphasize mandatory welfare. That's the issue to push.

114
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,778
First push the man, then the issue.

115
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,989
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.

116
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:05,242
An intelligent, interesting, fresh, fascinating man.

117
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:06,619
You forgot sexy.

118
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,203
I did not forget sexy.

119
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:11,040
You sound Iike you're seIIing mouthwash.

120
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:12,291
We are selling it.

121
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,710
- Are we authorized to do that? - Very funny.

122
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:17,963
You can get in trouble selling pharmaceuticals here.

123
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,716
My uncle's in jail because of that.

124
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:25,054
It's not reaIIy jaiI. Of course, with his wife, anything wouId be jaiI.

125
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:26,555
Look over there.

126
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:28,015
I Iove you.

127
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:29,350
Notice anything?

128
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,769
- No. - Well, put your glasses on.

129
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,563
Okay, just a minute. AII right.

130
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:37,066
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

131
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:47,618
What taxi driver?

132
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,953
The one that's sitting there.

133
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:53,540
- How Iong has he been there? - It feeIs Iike a Iong time.

134
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,585
- Does he bother you? - No.

135
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,879
You mean yes. You're being sarcastic.

136
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,964
You're quick. You're really quick.

137
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:02,716
I try to be reaI quick.

138
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,177
I'II pIay the maIe in this reIationship--

139
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:06,637
Good Iuck.

140
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:10,182
-- and tell him to move. And I don't need good luck.

141
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:13,143
Oh yes, you do. You just think you don't.

142
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:25,155
You're blocking our doorway. You think you might move your cab?

143
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:08,592
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

144
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,302
...Iipstick, rouge.

145
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,388
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

146
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:17,976
- The kind with the brush. - Yeah, it's Blush-on.

147
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:24,858
- Hey, Wiz. - That's Blush- on. My wife uses it.

148
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:27,152
Ask Travis. He's a Iadies' man.

149
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,780
A cup of coffee.

150
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:32,783
Whatever the fuck it is, she uses a Iot of it.

151
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:35,410
And then perfume. The spray kind.

152
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:38,121
Then in the middle of the Triboro Bridge--

153
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,541
And this woman is beautiful, she changes her pantyhose.

154
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,043
- No. - Oh, yeah.

155
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,127
What'd you do?

156
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:48,548
I throw the man out, and I jump in the back seat and whip it out.

157
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,926
And I said, "You know what this is?"

158
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,929
She says, " It's love." I fuck her brains out.

159
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:58,683
She goes wild and says, "That's the greatest single experience of my life."

160
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,437
Then she gave me a $200 tip and her phone number in Acapulco.

161
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,941
You know Doughboy, Charlie T.

162
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,362
Hey, Travis. Got change for a nickeI?

163
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,948
Doughboy will do anything for a buck.

164
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,202
So how's it hanging?

165
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:22,833
What's that?

166
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:29,714
I turn on the radio. Some fIeet driver from BeII just got aII cut up.

167
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:30,966
Stickup?

168
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:34,928
No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.

169
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,012
Where?

170
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:38,765
It was on 122nd Street.

171
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,351
Fucking Mau Mau Iand.

172
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,649
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?

173
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:59,536
You run all over town, don't you?

174
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:02,581
You handle some pretty rough customers.

175
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:04,332
Yeah, I have.

176
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,418
You carry a piece?

177
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,546
You need one?

178
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,508
I know a feIIa who can get you a reaI nice deaI.

179
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:15,594
Lots of shit around.

180
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:18,263
I never use mine. I'm conservative.

181
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:22,350
But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.

182
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,614
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

183
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,244
Look.

184
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,581
Piece of ErroI FIynn's bathtub.

185
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,708
Dig the symbols.

186
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,754
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

187
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,757
And the watermark.

188
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:55,675
There's one person...

189
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:57,552
...there's two persons...

190
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:59,387
...and there's three persons.

191
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:01,681
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

192
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,852
Take it, and if you can sell it, you give me half of what you got.

193
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:08,146
I don't want to.

194
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:11,066
I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.

195
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,500
Oh, I'm so terribIy sorry.

196
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,377
Nothing.

197
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,545
That's very cute. Thank you.

198
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:34,631
Hey, you wanna see something?

199
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:38,385
Wait, I just typed, "You wanna see something?"

200
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:43,848
If you had these three fingers missing on this hand...

201
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,309
...and that hand missing on that hand...

202
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:50,188
- ...how would you light the match? - I wouldn't.

203
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,565
Go ahead. Give it a try.

204
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,528
Well, I don't think I could do it.

205
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:58,029
No?

206
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,906
It's gonna be difficuIt.

207
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:01,950
I'II give it a try.

208
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,794
I got my thumb back for a second. Thank God.

209
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,505
Just a minute.

210
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:24,556
I can't do it.

211
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,808
The guy at the newsstand can.

212
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:29,060
Well, I don't work at a newsstand.

213
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,313
- Anyway, he's probably ltalian. - No.

214
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:34,107
- You're sure? - He's black.

215
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:37,652
If he had been ItaIian, he might've been a thief.

216
00:19:37,902 --> 00:19:41,489
If a thief screws up on the job, the mob bIows his fingers off.

217
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:44,242
This sounds Iike a joke, but it's true.

218
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,620
If they kiII a stooI pigeon, they Ieave a canary on the body.

219
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,124
- It's symboIic. - Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

220
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:54,043
I don't know why not. Wait a minute.

221
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:58,131
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary, you can walk into a pet store...

222
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:01,134
...kill it right there. Put it on anyone you want.

223
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:31,456
- I'd Iike to voIunteer. - I'II take you right over here.

224
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:34,334
I'd rather voIunteer to her, if you don't mind.

225
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,423
Why do you have to volunteer to me?

226
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:44,761
Because you are the most beautifuI woman I have ever seen.

227
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,556
Thanks.

228
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:51,017
But what do you think of Palantine?

229
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,692
The man you're volunteering to help elect President.

230
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:06,491
I don't know what his poIicies are, but I'm sure he'II make a good one.

231
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,787
- Do you want to canvass? - Yeah, I'II canvass.

232
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,581
How do you feeI about his stand on weIfare?

233
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,252
I don't reaIIy know his stand on weIfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand.

234
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:20,004
You're sure of that?

235
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:26,052
We all work together here, day and night...

236
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:29,430
...so I'm sure the gentIemen wiII sign you up over there.

237
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:34,185
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night, so it's kind of hard for me...

238
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,562
...to work in the day.

239
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:39,816
Then what exactly do you want?

240
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:42,777
Would you like to have coffee and pie with me?

241
00:21:42,986 --> 00:21:44,237
Why?

242
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:46,656
Why? I'II teII you why.

243
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,951
I think you're a IoneIy person.

244
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:52,787
I drive by a Iot, and I see you here.

245
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,997
I see a Iot of peopIe around you...

246
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:58,292
...and I see these phones and aII this stuff on your desk...

247
00:21:58,501 --> 00:21:59,836
...and it means nothing.

248
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,171
And when I came inside and met you...

249
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,133
...I saw in your eyes and how you carried yourseIf...

250
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:07,552
...that you're not a happy person.

251
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:09,929
And I think you need something.

252
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:13,015
If you wanna caII it a friend, you can caII it that.

253
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:16,102
You're gonna be my friend?

254
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:26,738
What do you say?

255
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:34,579
It's a IittIe hard standing here and asking you, so...

256
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,545
Five minutes, that's all. Just outside. Right around here.

257
00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:44,464
I'm there to protect you.

258
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:52,805
Come on. Just take a IittIe break.

259
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:58,060
I have a break at 4:00. If you're here--

260
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,353
4:00 today?

261
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:03,441
- I'II be here. - I'm sure you wiII.

262
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:06,569
- AII right. Four p.m. - Right.

263
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,489
- Outside in the front? - Yes.

264
00:23:10,198 --> 00:23:12,658
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

265
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,247
I appreciate this, Betsy.

266
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:35,181
<i>May 26th, four o'clock p.m.</i>

267
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:39,310
<i>I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop on Columbus Circle.</i>

268
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:44,941
<i>I had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese.</i>

269
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:47,401
<i>I think that was a good selection.</i>

270
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,946
<i>Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.</i>

271
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:52,073
<i>She could've had anything she wanted.</i>

272
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,992
15,000 volunteers in New York alone isn't bad.

273
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:57,036
But the organizationaI probIems!

274
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:02,166
Yeah, I know what you mean. I got the same probIems.

275
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:07,463
I gotta get organized. LittIe things, Iike my apartment, my possessions.

276
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:12,093
I should get a sign: "One of these days, I'll get organiz-ized."

277
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:13,970
You mean "organized"?

278
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:16,055
Organiz-ized.

279
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,724
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

280
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,186
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

281
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:26,691
You mean "organiz-ized." Like those signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

282
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:34,281
Do you Iike where you work?

283
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,620
We've got some good people. Palantine's got a good chance.

284
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,835
You know you have beautifuI eyes?

285
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:54,510
Do you Iike the guy you work with?

286
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,345
He's okay.

287
00:24:58,222 --> 00:24:59,598
But do you Iike him?

288
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:04,562
He's funny and very good at his job. Though he does have a few problems.

289
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,939
I'd say he has quite a few probIems.

290
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:11,736
His energy seems to go in the wrong places.

291
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:15,156
When I waIked in and I saw you two sitting there...

292
00:25:15,364 --> 00:25:18,242
...I couId just teII that there was no connection...

293
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:19,827
...whatsoever.

294
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:23,289
And when I waIked in, there was something between us.

295
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:26,208
There was an impulse we were both following.

296
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,128
So that gave me the right to talk to you.

297
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:33,090
Otherwise, I never wouId've had the right to taIk to you.

298
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,302
I never wouId've had the courage to taIk to you.

299
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,680
And with him, I feIt there was nothing.

300
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:42,975
When I waIked in, I knew I was right. Did you feeI that way?

301
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:48,856
I wouIdn't be here if I didn't.

302
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:52,443
Where are you from?

303
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,153
Upstate.

304
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,867
That fellow, I don't like him.

305
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:03,078
Not that I don't Iike him, I just think he's siIIy.

306
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,791
I don't think he respects you.

307
00:26:08,918 --> 00:26:12,046
I don't beIieve I've ever met anyone quite Iike you.

308
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,100
You wanna go to...

309
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:28,103
...a movie with me?

310
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:32,608
- I have to go back to work now. - I don't mean now. Another time?

311
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,575
Sure. You know what you remind me of?

312
00:26:42,493 --> 00:26:43,452
What?

313
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,912
That song...

314
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,166
...by Kris Kristofferson.

315
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:52,628
Who's that?

316
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:54,755
The songwriter.

317
00:26:54,964 --> 00:26:56,507
" He's a prophet...

318
00:26:56,757 --> 00:26:58,467
He's a prophet and a pusher...

319
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:02,721
...partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction."

320
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,808
You saying that about me?

321
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,726
Who else would I be talking about?

322
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,020
I'm no pusher. I've never pushed.

323
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,941
Just the part about the contradictions.

324
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:15,985
You are that.

325
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:50,394
<i>I called Betsy again. She said maybe we'd go to a movie...</i>

326
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,522
<i>...after work tomorrow. That's my day off.</i>

327
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,901
<i>At first she hesitated, but I called her again and she agreed.</i>

328
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:01,071
<i>Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.</i>

329
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:03,991
<i>Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name.</i>

330
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:07,494
<i>Damn! I gotta remember stuff like that.</i>

331
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,341
Don't worry about anyone committing themselves...

332
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,219
...untiI things come in from CaIifornia.

333
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,347
Listen, I think we shouId've waited for the Iimo.

334
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:29,558
I don't mind the cab, but I mind...

335
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:33,187
...going to California without the right preparation.

336
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:35,606
Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?

337
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,234
Yes, I am.

338
00:28:40,611 --> 00:28:45,532
I teII everybody that comes in this taxi that they have to vote for you.

339
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:47,326
Why, thank you...

340
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:50,245
...Travis.

341
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:53,582
I'm sure you'II win. Everybody I know wiII vote for you.

342
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,210
I was gonna put your sticker in my taxi...

343
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,338
...but the company said it was against their policy.

344
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:01,173
They're a bunch of jerks.

345
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:04,218
Let me tell you, I have learned more about America...

346
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:07,638
...from riding in cabs than in all the limos in the U.S.

347
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:12,351
- Oh, yeah? - That's true.

348
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,395
- Can I ask you something, Travis? - Sure.

349
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:18,774
What bugs you the most about this country?

350
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:25,280
Well, I don't know. I don't follow political issues that closely, sir.

351
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:27,991
Well, there must be something.

352
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:32,371
Well, whatever it is, he should clean up this city here...

353
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:37,084
...because it's Iike an open sewer. It's fuII of fiIth and scum.

354
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,378
Sometimes I can hardIy take it.

355
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:42,589
Whatever becomes the President should just...

356
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,342
...really clean it up. You know?

357
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:49,221
Sometimes I go out and I smeII it. I get headaches, it's so bad.

358
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:52,516
And they just never go away, you know?

359
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:55,102
I think that the President shouId just...

360
00:29:55,602 --> 00:30:00,107
...clean up this mess. He should flush it right down the fucking toilet.

361
00:30:08,198 --> 00:30:10,742
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

362
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,995
But it's not gonna be easy.

363
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:16,665
- We'II have to make radicaI changes. - Damn straight.

364
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,085
Here you go. Keep the change.

365
00:30:20,294 --> 00:30:21,586
Thank you.

366
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,134
- Nice talking to you. - Nice talking to you.

367
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:29,720
You're a good man. I know you're gonna win.

368
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,930
Thank you, I think.

369
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,039
Just get me outta here, all right?

370
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,252
Come on!

371
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,755
Come on, baby. This is a reaI drag.

372
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:07,591
Now, come on! Don't make a scene.

373
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:10,677
You wanna get busted?

374
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:12,179
Bitch, be cooI!

375
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:23,148
Don't start no trouble.

376
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,318
Cabbie, just forget about this.

377
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:27,778
Be cool, bitch!

378
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,959
Get your ass out of here!

379
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,321
Hi there.

380
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,908
- Have a nice day today? - Not particularly.

381
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,785
Got a present for you.

382
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,710
Now back to Gene Krupa's syncopated style shortly.

383
00:33:56,843 --> 00:33:58,094
Why'd you do that?

384
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:01,222
What else am I gonna do with my money?

385
00:34:01,598 --> 00:34:03,725
I wish you'd have Iistened to this.

386
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,312
I wouId have, except my record pIayer doesn't work now.

387
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:08,772
Your stereo's broken?

388
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:11,441
How do you stand it? I can't Iive without music.

389
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:15,320
I don't foIIow music too much, but I wouId reaIIy Iike to.

390
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,114
Then you haven't played this record yet.

391
00:34:19,866 --> 00:34:24,621
But I was thinking maybe we couId Iisten to it on your record pIayer.

392
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:28,541
Now, going back through 40 years of Chick Webb.

393
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,309
You gotta be kidding.

394
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,477
What?

395
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,813
This is a dirty movie.

396
00:34:50,396 --> 00:34:54,234
No, no. This is a movie that a Iot of coupIes come to.

397
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:58,363
- AII kinds of coupIes go here. - You sure about that?

398
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,282
Yeah, I see them aII the time.

399
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:05,662
Come on.

400
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:50,331
- Where are you going? - I have to Ieave.

401
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,834
- Why? - I don't know why I came in here.

402
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,336
- I don't Iike these movies. - WeII, I mean--

403
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,464
I didn't know you'd feeI that way about this movie.

404
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:01,593
- If I had-- - Are these the onIy movies you go to?

405
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,804
Yeah, I mean I come and-- This is not so bad.

406
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:08,850
Taking me here is as exciting to me as saying, " Let's fuck."

407
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:15,690
There are other movies I can take you to.

408
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:19,193
I don't know much about them, but I can take you other pIaces.

409
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:21,195
We're just different.

410
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:23,990
- Wait a second. - I have to go.

411
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:25,408
I've got to go now.

412
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:29,245
- Wait a second, I want to taIk. - But I have to go.

413
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:30,955
Taxi!

414
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:35,460
Can I taIk to you at Ieast? Won't you at Ieast to taIk to me?

415
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,878
Take the record.

416
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:39,422
- I've aIready got it. - But, pIease.

417
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:43,635
- I bought it for you, Betsy. - Okay, now I've got two. Let's go.

418
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:45,553
Can I caII you?

419
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,890
Jesus Christ, I got a taxi.

420
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,356
Hello, Betsy.

421
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,274
Hi, it's Travis.

422
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,112
Listen, I'm sorry about the other night.

423
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:06,407
I didn't know that was the way you feIt about it.

424
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:13,289
Well, I didn't know. If I-- I'd have taken you somewhere else.

425
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,626
Are you feeling better or...?

426
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:21,214
Maybe you had a virus or something. A 24-hour virus, you know.

427
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:23,716
It can happen. Yeah.

428
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:31,015
You've been working hard, huh?

429
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:38,356
Would you like to have some dinner with me...

430
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:41,234
...in the next few days or something?

431
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:45,863
How about a cup of coffee?

432
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:50,201
I couId come by the headquarters or something, and we couId...

433
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:52,912
Okay, okay.

434
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:58,126
Did you get my flowers and the...?

435
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:04,382
You didn't get them? But I sent some fIowers.

436
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:12,932
Can I caII you again?

437
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:15,434
Tomorrow or the next day?

438
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,980
No, I'm gonna-- Okay, yeah, sure.

439
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:20,648
So Iong.

440
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:25,236
<i>I tried several times to call her...</i>

441
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:28,990
<i>...but after the first call, she wouldn't come to the phone.</i>

442
00:38:29,448 --> 00:38:31,826
<i>I also sent flowers, but with no luck.</i>

443
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,662
<i>The smell of the flowers made me sicker.</i>

444
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:39,417
<i>The headaches got worse. I think I got stomach cancer.</i>

445
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:42,128
<i>I shouldn't complain, though.</i>

446
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:44,630
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

447
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,967
<i>You're only as healthy as you feel.</i>

448
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:50,678
<i>You're only...</i>

449
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,597
<i>...as healthy...</i>

450
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:54,223
<i>...as...</i>

451
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:56,017
<i>...you...</i>

452
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,602
<i>... feel.</i>

453
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:11,574
- Let's not have trouble. - Why won't you talk to me?

454
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,243
You think I don't know you're here?

455
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:16,495
You think I don't know?

456
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:18,372
- Please leave. - Take your hands off!

457
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:20,750
I just want you to know--

458
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,045
Please. This is no place to do this.

459
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:26,589
- Take your hands off! - Just Ieave.

460
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,134
- AII right, Ieave, then! - I wanna teII you...

461
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:32,762
...you're in hell! And you'll die in hell.

462
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,723
- There's a cop over there. - You're Iike the rest of them.

463
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,267
Look, I'm caIIing the cop. Officer!

464
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:42,647
Officer!

465
00:39:44,273 --> 00:39:47,610
Don't come around here, because I'II caII the poIice!

466
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:53,658
<i>I realize now, how much she's just like the others, cold and distant.</i>

467
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:55,534
<i>Many people are like that.</i>

468
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:59,038
<i>Women for sure. They're like a union.</i>

469
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,541
Yo, cabbie!

470
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,219
Pull over to the curb over there. Right over there.

471
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:16,055
No, don't.

472
00:40:17,473 --> 00:40:19,892
The fucking meter. What are you doing?

473
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:22,145
What are you doing with the meter?

474
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,523
Did I teII you to do that with the meter?

475
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:29,610
Put the meter back. I don't care what I have to pay.

476
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:33,489
I'm not getting out. Put the meter back on.

477
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:34,699
Put it down.

478
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:37,034
That's right.

479
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,078
Put it down!

480
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,206
That's right.

481
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:45,585
Why are you writing? Don't write!

482
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,295
Put the thing down. Just sit.

483
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,885
I didn't tell you to write. I just said, " Pull over."

484
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:56,596
Pull over to the curb and sit here.

485
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:00,141
We're gonna sit.

486
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:22,872
Cabbie, you see that Iight up there? In the window?

487
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:26,709
The Iight? The window in the second fIoor.

488
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:33,299
The one that's closest to the edge of the building.

489
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,887
The Iight up in the window. Second story.

490
00:41:39,555 --> 00:41:41,265
What are you, blind?

491
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:43,100
Do you see the Iight?

492
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,854
Yeah, you see it. Good.

493
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:50,149
See the woman?

494
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:55,488
Do you see the woman in the window?

495
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:58,366
Yeah.

496
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:03,746
I want you to see that woman because that's my wife.

497
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,125
But that's not my apartment.

498
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:13,756
It's not my apartment. You know who Iives there?

499
00:42:14,757 --> 00:42:18,344
No, you wouldn't know. But you know who lives there?

500
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,263
A nigger Iives there.

501
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,349
How do you Iike that?

502
00:42:30,523 --> 00:42:32,525
And I'm gonna kiII her.

503
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,613
There's nothing else. I'm gonna kill her.

504
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,824
What do you think of that?

505
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:43,786
I said, "What do you think of that?"

506
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:45,705
Don't answer.

507
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,165
You don't have to answer everything.

508
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:55,089
I'm gonna kiII her with a .44 Magnum pistoI.

509
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:59,844
I have a .44 Magnum pistoI. I'm gonna kiII her with that gun.

510
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:04,056
Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum can do to a woman's face?

511
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:07,977
It'd fucking destroy it. Just bIow it right apart.

512
00:43:08,227 --> 00:43:10,479
That's what it can do to a face.

513
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:13,941
Did you ever see what it can do to a woman's pussy?

514
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,029
You should see what a .44 Magnum's gonna do to a woman's pussy.

515
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,288
What's that?

516
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,499
I know you must think that I'm, you know...

517
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:34,462
You must think I'm pretty sick or something.

518
00:43:35,337 --> 00:43:37,798
Right? You must think I'm pretty sick?

519
00:43:42,011 --> 00:43:45,514
Right? I bet you reaIIy think I'm sick, right?

520
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:54,064
You think I'm sick?

521
00:43:57,651 --> 00:44:00,779
You don't have to answer. I'm paying for the ride.

522
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,700
<i>I picked up this midget, you know.</i>

523
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,453
He's very well-dressed, ltalian suit...

524
00:44:07,703 --> 00:44:10,122
...good-Iooking, with a beautifuI bIonde.

525
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:12,833
- A Iady midget? - No, the guy was a midget.

526
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,377
- The blonde was a lady. - I got you.

527
00:44:15,628 --> 00:44:17,630
Those midgets are funny.

528
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,966
Sometimes I Iike to hoId a midget.

529
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,969
They always want to sit in the front seat.

530
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,475
Then I pick up these two fags. They're going downtown.

531
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:35,814
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts. They start arguing and yelling.

532
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:39,026
The other one says, "You bitch," and starts beating him.

533
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:41,737
I say, " I don't care what you do in the privacy...

534
00:44:41,987 --> 00:44:44,323
...of your own home, behind closed doors."

535
00:44:44,531 --> 00:44:46,241
This is a free country.

536
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:51,038
We got a pursuit of happiness thing. You're consenting, you're adult.

537
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:56,043
But, you know, in my fucking cab, don't go busting heads.

538
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:59,254
- Do what you want. - Tell them to go to California.

539
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:04,134
In CaIifornia, when two fags spIit up, one's got to pay the other aIimony.

540
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,349
Not bad. They're way ahead out there, you know? California.

541
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:12,476
So I teII them to get out.

542
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:15,312
One time, I saw a cop chase this guy with one Ieg.

543
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:18,649
- He was on crutches, you know. - The cop?

544
00:45:18,857 --> 00:45:22,444
No, the dude he was chasing. Fucking cops, they chase anything.

545
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,823
You got that five you owe me?

546
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:31,245
My man is Ioading, Ioading.

547
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:36,125
I be broke if I hadn't caught me some peopIe from Ohio out at Kennedy.

548
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:40,462
I took them into Manhattan by way of Long Beach, tipped me $5.

549
00:45:40,713 --> 00:45:42,715
How's the action around?

550
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:44,508
It's very sIow.

551
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:47,094
I'm shoving on.

552
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,638
Hey, Wiz, wait.

553
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,892
- Can I taIk to you for a second? - Bye, KiIIer.

554
00:46:14,913 --> 00:46:16,415
You can have them!

555
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:19,001
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

556
00:46:20,752 --> 00:46:23,297
You better take your ass out, boy!

557
00:46:29,178 --> 00:46:32,347
I know you and I ain't taIked too much, you know.

558
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,975
But you've been around, so...

559
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,728
Shoot, that's why they call me the Wizard.

560
00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:39,229
I got...

561
00:46:40,022 --> 00:46:42,149
It's just that I got a...

562
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:45,402
Things got you down?

563
00:46:46,195 --> 00:46:48,655
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

564
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,367
Yeah, they got me reaI down. ReaI...

565
00:46:57,998 --> 00:46:59,458
I just want to go out...

566
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:03,837
...and you know, really, really do something.

567
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:07,799
Taxi Iife, you mean?

568
00:47:11,637 --> 00:47:13,430
No, it's...

569
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:15,933
I don't know.

570
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,312
I just want to go out...

571
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,567
I reaIIy want to...

572
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:28,862
I got some bad ideas in my head.

573
00:47:30,906 --> 00:47:33,116
Look at it this way.

574
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,247
A man takes a job.

575
00:47:38,747 --> 00:47:40,374
And that job...

576
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:44,920
...you know, that becomes what he is.

577
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:47,005
You know, Iike...

578
00:47:48,548 --> 00:47:51,176
You do a thing, and that's what you are.

579
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,223
I've been a cabbie for 17 years. Ten years at night.

580
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,309
And I stiII don't own my own cab. You know why?

581
00:48:00,102 --> 00:48:04,272
Because I don't want to. That must be what I want.

582
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:07,651
To be on the night shift, driving somebody else's cab.

583
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,528
You understand?

584
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,532
You get a job, you become the job.

585
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,285
One guy Iives in BrookIyn, one guy Iives in Sutton PIace.

586
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,997
You get a Iawyer, another guy's a doctor.

587
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:23,333
Another guy dies, another guy gets well...

588
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:25,335
...and people are born.

589
00:48:25,544 --> 00:48:27,671
I envy you, your youth.

590
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:32,300
Go out and get Iaid. Get drunk. Do anything.

591
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:37,931
You got no choice, anyway. I mean, we're aII fucked.

592
00:48:39,725 --> 00:48:41,852
More or Iess, you know?

593
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:49,776
I don't know. That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard of.

594
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:56,074
It's not Bertrand RusseII, but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

595
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:59,161
I don't even know what you're taIking about.

596
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,663
Maybe I don't know either.

597
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:07,544
Don't worry so much. Relax, kid, you're gonna be all right.

598
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:10,630
I know. I've seen a Iot of peopIe...

599
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,924
...and I know.

600
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,052
Okay. Thanks, man.

601
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:24,603
Yeah, you know. You're all right.

602
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:47,083
<i>What do you think of your opponent's chances in the upcoming primary?</i>

603
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:48,877
<i>Mr. Goodman is a fine man.</i>

604
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:52,422
<i>I would certainly, if it came to it, prefer him...</i>

605
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,175
<i>... to our opponent in the other party.</i>

606
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:59,054
<i>I think that my programs are better defined than his.</i>

607
00:49:59,304 --> 00:50:02,974
<i>They're more imaginative. I have a better chance of winning.</i>

608
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:06,019
<i>It's academic, though. He's not going to win. I am.</i>

609
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,979
<i>I see.</i>

610
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:11,566
<i>Well, one more thing I'd like to ask you.</i>

611
00:50:11,816 --> 00:50:14,027
<i>How do you feel your campaign is going?</i>

612
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,405
<i>When we came up with our slogan "We are the people"...</i>

613
00:50:17,656 --> 00:50:19,908
<i>... when I said "Let the people rule"...</i>

614
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:22,994
<i>...I felt I was being overly optimistic.</i>

615
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:26,790
<i>I must tell you that I am more optimistic now than ever before.</i>

616
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,919
<i>The people are rising to the demands that I have made on them.</i>

617
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:33,588
<i>The people are beginning to rule.</i>

618
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,424
<i>I feel it is a groundswell. I know...</i>

619
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:40,553
<i>... it will continue through the primary and in Miami.</i>

620
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,555
<i>And I know it will rise...</i>

621
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:45,475
<i>... to an unprecedented swell in November.</i>

622
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,980
That bitch! I'II bIow her brains out!

623
00:52:14,189 --> 00:52:18,318
I'II kiII her, goddamn it! I'm gonna get my hands and kiII her!

624
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:19,861
Shoot, goddamn it!

625
00:52:25,617 --> 00:52:27,076
Hey, Sport.

626
00:52:29,621 --> 00:52:32,707
- That guy keeps following us. - Don't look at him.

627
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,433
Hey, guys.

628
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:55,230
Wanna take a walk?

629
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:11,621
<i>Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere.</i>

630
00:53:11,996 --> 00:53:14,415
<i>In bars, in cars...</i>

631
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,293
<i>...sidewalks, stores, everywhere.</i>

632
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:19,837
<i>There's no escape.</i>

633
00:53:20,505 --> 00:53:22,757
<i>I'm God's lonely man.</i>

634
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,388
<i>June 8th.</i>

635
00:53:28,888 --> 00:53:31,349
<i>My life has taken another turn again.</i>

636
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,061
<i>The days move along with regularity, over and over...</i>

637
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,814
<i>... one day indistinguishable from the next.</i>

638
00:53:38,064 --> 00:53:40,525
<i>A long, continuous chain.</i>

639
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,569
<i>And then suddenly...</i>

640
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,862
<i>... there is change.</i>

641
00:53:59,544 --> 00:54:02,380
This here's Easy Andy. He's a traveling salesman.

642
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:04,674
How are you doing, Travis?

643
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:30,116
- You got a .44 Magnum? - It's an expensive weapon.

644
00:54:30,325 --> 00:54:32,368
It's aII right. I got money.

645
00:54:32,577 --> 00:54:34,287
It's a reaI monster.

646
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:39,083
Stop a car at 100 yards, put a round right through the engine.

647
00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:51,804
Here you go.

648
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:54,849
It's a premium, high resaIe weapon.

649
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:00,563
Look at that.

650
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,900
That's a beauty.

651
00:55:08,696 --> 00:55:12,116
I couId seII this gun to some jungIe bunny in HarIem for $500.

652
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:16,412
But I just deaI high-quaIity goods to the right peopIe.

653
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:18,915
How about that?

654
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:22,293
This might be too big for practicaI purposes.

655
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:24,754
In which case, for you, I'd recommend...

656
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,964
...38 snub-nosed.

657
00:55:29,008 --> 00:55:30,384
Look at this.

658
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,014
That's a beautifuI IittIe gun.

659
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:40,102
It's nickeI-pIated, snub-nosed, but basicaIIy a service revoIver.

660
00:55:40,353 --> 00:55:42,522
It'II stop anything that moves.

661
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:46,275
The Magnum, they use that in Africa for killing elephants.

662
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:47,401
That .38...

663
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,570
...that's a funny gun.

664
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:56,911
Some of these guns are Iike toys.

665
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,248
That .38, you go out and hammer nails with it all day...

666
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:03,751
...come back and it'II cut dead center on target every time.

667
00:56:04,168 --> 00:56:07,922
It's got a reaIIy nice action to it and a heck of a waIIop.

668
00:56:10,591 --> 00:56:12,343
You interested in an automatic?

669
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:16,681
It's a CoIt .25 automatic. It's a nice IittIe gun.

670
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:18,099
It's a beautifuI gun.

671
00:56:18,307 --> 00:56:20,893
Holds six shots in the clip, one in the chamber.

672
00:56:21,102 --> 00:56:23,187
If you're dumb enough to put one there.

673
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:25,606
Here.

674
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,108
Look at this.

675
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:28,818
.380 Walther.

676
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:31,279
Holds eight shots in the clip.

677
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,407
That's a nice gun.

678
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,118
That's a beautifuI IittIe gun. Look at that.

679
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:44,834
During World War ll, they used this gun to replace the P 38.

680
00:56:45,626 --> 00:56:47,878
Just given out to officers.

681
00:56:53,634 --> 00:56:55,678
Ain't that a IittIe honey?

682
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,440
- How much for everything? - AII together?

683
00:57:07,648 --> 00:57:11,736
Only a jackass would carry that cannon in the streets like that.

684
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,324
Here's a beautifuI handmade hoIster I had made in Mexico.

685
00:57:16,574 --> 00:57:18,409
Forty dollars.

686
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,330
Three-fifty for the Magnum, two-fifty for the .38...

687
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:25,958
...one and a quarter for the .25, one- fifty for the .380.

688
00:57:26,334 --> 00:57:29,378
Take this and wait here. I'II waIk down with you.

689
00:57:30,296 --> 00:57:33,257
How about dope? Grass? Hash? Coke?

690
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:37,428
Mescaline? Downers? Nebutal? Chloral hydrates?

691
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:41,182
- Uppers, amphetamines? - I'm not interested in that stuff.

692
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:44,060
I can get you crystaI meth, nitrous oxide.

693
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,687
How about a Cadillac? A brand-new Cadillac...

694
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:48,731
...with the pink slip, two grand.

695
00:57:57,365 --> 00:57:58,866
<i>June 29th.</i>

696
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:03,245
<i>I gotta get in shape. Too much sitting has ruined my body.</i>

697
00:58:03,454 --> 00:58:05,581
<i>Too much abuse has gone on for too long.</i>

698
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:08,250
<i>From now on, it'll be 50 pushups each morning.</i>

699
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:11,587
<i>Fifty pull-ups. There will be no more pills.</i>

700
00:58:11,837 --> 00:58:15,966
<i>There will be no more bad food, no more destroyers of my body.</i>

701
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:20,262
<i>It'll be total organization. Every muscle must be tight.</i>

702
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:39,990
<i>Look at the size of that. Oh, yeah.</i>

703
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:44,745
<i>Oh, it looks so good.</i>

704
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:54,547
<i>It's getting harder and harder, and it's throbbing now.</i>

705
00:58:56,090 --> 00:59:00,094
<i>The idea had been growing in my brain for some time.</i>

706
00:59:01,011 --> 00:59:02,471
<i>True force.</i>

707
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:07,268
<i>All the king's men cannot put it back together again.</i>

708
01:01:07,846 --> 01:01:11,767
- Where do we get more? - Where do you think? At headquarters.

709
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:14,144
AII the way back there?

710
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:15,562
- Come on. - They'II work.

711
01:01:15,813 --> 01:01:18,482
- Maybe it's the speakers. - I've done this 100 times.

712
01:01:18,732 --> 01:01:20,984
- You've done this before? - Yes, don't worry.

713
01:01:21,235 --> 01:01:24,113
- When was the Iast time? - I've never done this before.

714
01:01:27,408 --> 01:01:28,242
What?

715
01:01:29,993 --> 01:01:31,995
Come here, come here.

716
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,681
You're a Secret Service man, aren't you?

717
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,852
Just waiting for the senator.

718
01:02:37,728 --> 01:02:39,980
You're waiting for the senator?

719
01:02:43,817 --> 01:02:46,069
That's a very good answer.

720
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,530
Shit, man.

721
01:02:49,406 --> 01:02:51,658
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.

722
01:02:53,577 --> 01:02:57,289
No, the reason I asked if you were a Secret Service man--

723
01:02:57,539 --> 01:02:59,082
I won't say anything--

724
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:00,834
Is because I--

725
01:03:04,796 --> 01:03:07,132
I saw some suspicious-Iooking peopIe over there.

726
01:03:07,382 --> 01:03:09,509
- You did? - They were right over there.

727
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,309
They were just here.

728
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:22,814
They were very, very...

729
01:03:23,023 --> 01:03:24,608
Suspicious.

730
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:30,405
Where did they go?

731
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:33,575
Is it hard to get to be in the Secret Service?

732
01:03:33,784 --> 01:03:34,618
Why?

733
01:03:34,826 --> 01:03:37,788
I was just curious, because I think I'd be good at it.

734
01:03:38,038 --> 01:03:39,831
I'm very observant.

735
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,751
I was in the Marine Corps, you know.

736
01:03:43,043 --> 01:03:45,045
I'm good with crowds.

737
01:03:47,422 --> 01:03:50,926
I noticed your IittIe pin there. It's Iike a signaI, isn't it?

738
01:03:51,176 --> 01:03:52,135
Sort of.

739
01:03:52,386 --> 01:03:56,515
A signaI. A secret signaI for the Secret Service.

740
01:03:59,935 --> 01:04:01,937
What kind of guns you guys carry?

741
01:04:02,187 --> 01:04:07,192
.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums? Something bigger, maybe?

742
01:04:07,442 --> 01:04:12,155
Look, if you're really interested, if you give me your name and address...

743
01:04:12,406 --> 01:04:15,909
...we'II send you aII the information on how to appIy. How's that?

744
01:04:18,495 --> 01:04:21,123
- You will? - Sure.

745
01:04:21,748 --> 01:04:23,208
Why not?

746
01:04:26,795 --> 01:04:28,630
My name is Henry...

747
01:04:30,173 --> 01:04:33,009
...Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

748
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:40,308
154 Hopper Avenue.

749
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,394
Hopper?

750
01:04:44,896 --> 01:04:47,607
You know, Iike a rabbit? Hip, hop.

751
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,612
Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

752
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:56,491
Is there a zip code?

753
01:04:56,741 --> 01:04:59,703
6-1- 0-4-5-2.

754
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:05,709
That's six digits. 6, 1...

755
01:05:06,835 --> 01:05:09,504
Oh, well, 6-1- 0-4-5.

756
01:05:12,465 --> 01:05:15,468
I was thinking of my teIephone number.

757
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:16,803
Well, I've got it all.

758
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:19,764
Henry, we'II get aII the stuff right out to you.

759
01:05:20,015 --> 01:05:23,476
Thanks a Iot. Hey, great. Thanks a Iot. HeII. Jesus.

760
01:05:23,685 --> 01:05:25,520
- Be carefuI today. - Right. WiII do.

761
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:29,941
You have to be carefuI around a pIace Iike this. Bye.

762
01:06:07,354 --> 01:06:10,607
Faster than you. Fucking sick.

763
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,526
I saw you coming, you fuck.

764
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,403
ShitheeI!

765
01:06:18,823 --> 01:06:21,701
I'm standing here. You make the move.

766
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:23,620
You make the move.

767
01:06:24,037 --> 01:06:25,747
It's your move.

768
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:31,002
Don't try it, you fuck.

769
01:06:37,592 --> 01:06:39,386
You talking to me?

770
01:06:41,346 --> 01:06:43,556
You talking to me?

771
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:47,310
You talking to me?

772
01:06:49,562 --> 01:06:52,941
Then who the hell else are you talking to? You talking to me?

773
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:55,443
Well, I'm the only one here.

774
01:06:57,195 --> 01:07:00,657
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

775
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:02,534
Oh, yeah?

776
01:07:13,628 --> 01:07:16,005
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads.</i>

777
01:07:16,214 --> 01:07:18,758
<i>Here is a man who would not take it anymore.</i>

778
01:07:19,008 --> 01:07:21,136
<i>Who would not let--</i>

779
01:07:21,386 --> 01:07:24,222
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads.</i>

780
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:27,892
<i>Here is a man who would not take it anymore.</i>

781
01:07:28,143 --> 01:07:30,186
<i>Who stood up against the scum...</i>

782
01:07:30,395 --> 01:07:32,814
<i>... the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.</i>

783
01:07:33,064 --> 01:07:36,025
<i>Here is someone who stood up.</i>

784
01:07:37,026 --> 01:07:37,861
<i>Here is...</i>

785
01:07:42,866 --> 01:07:44,325
You're dead.

786
01:08:11,227 --> 01:08:13,480
<i>Hey, Travis, qué pasa?</i>

787
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,149
<i>Hi, Melio. Qué pasa?</i>

788
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:26,826
Yeah, man?

789
01:08:27,076 --> 01:08:31,164
Shut your fucking mouth and give me the cash out the drawer. Come on!

790
01:08:31,414 --> 01:08:34,209
- Let's go. Give me the damn cash. - Don't shoot.

791
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:36,628
Stop taking so Iong. Come on!

792
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:39,297
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

793
01:08:39,505 --> 01:08:41,424
- This all you got? - That's it.

794
01:08:41,633 --> 01:08:43,593
I don't have any more money, man.

795
01:08:43,801 --> 01:08:45,595
- That's all I got! - You got more.

796
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:48,973
- I teII you, I got no money! - Reach in your sock.

797
01:08:49,182 --> 01:08:50,975
Give me the rest of the fucking bread.

798
01:08:56,773 --> 01:08:58,983
- Did you get him? - Yeah, I got him.

799
01:09:03,696 --> 01:09:05,907
Shit, man.

800
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:10,703
- Is he dead? - I don't know. His eyes are moving.

801
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:20,129
I ain't got a permit. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

802
01:09:25,051 --> 01:09:26,636
Don't worry. I'II take care of it.

803
01:09:26,844 --> 01:09:27,720
Can I pay you?

804
01:09:28,429 --> 01:09:29,764
Just get out of here.

805
01:09:29,973 --> 01:09:32,475
No, man. I'II take care of it. Go ahead.

806
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:39,148
That's the fifth motherfucker this year!

807
01:11:24,837 --> 01:11:27,423
<i>Walt Whitman, that great American poet...</i>

808
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:29,717
<i>...spoke for all of us when he said...</i>

809
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:32,678
<i>... "I am the man. I suffered.</i>

810
01:11:32,887 --> 01:11:36,057
<i>I was there. " Today I say to you...</i>

811
01:11:36,307 --> 01:11:39,685
<i>... we are the people. We suffered.</i>

812
01:11:39,936 --> 01:11:42,188
<i>We were there.</i>

813
01:11:44,523 --> 01:11:47,693
<i>We, the people, suffered in Vietnam.</i>

814
01:11:47,944 --> 01:11:51,030
<i>We, the people, suffered. We still suffer...</i>

815
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,033
<i>... from unemployment, inflation...</i>

816
01:11:54,283 --> 01:11:56,285
<i>... crime and corruption.</i>

817
01:11:59,705 --> 01:12:01,499
<i>Dear Father and Mother...</i>

818
01:12:01,749 --> 01:12:04,043
<i>...July is the month I remember...</i>

819
01:12:04,252 --> 01:12:07,463
<i>... which brings not only your wedding anniversary...</i>

820
01:12:07,672 --> 01:12:10,883
<i>...but also Father's Day and Mother's birthday.</i>

821
01:12:11,092 --> 01:12:14,011
<i>I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates...</i>

822
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:18,266
<i>...but I hope this card will take care of them all.</i>

823
01:12:18,516 --> 01:12:21,644
<i>I'm sorry, again, I cannot send you my address...</i>

824
01:12:21,852 --> 01:12:24,438
<i>... like I promised to last year.</i>

825
01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:29,777
<i>But the sensitive nature of my work for the government demands utmost secrecy.</i>

826
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:33,072
<i>I know you will understand.</i>

827
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:36,659
<i>I am healthy and well and making lots of money.</i>

828
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:38,953
<i>I've been dating a girl for a few months...</i>

829
01:12:39,161 --> 01:12:41,747
<i>...and I know you'd be proud if you could see her.</i>

830
01:12:42,331 --> 01:12:46,085
<i>Her name is Betsy, but I can tell you no more than that.</i>

831
01:12:46,293 --> 01:12:48,629
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

832
01:12:50,339 --> 01:12:53,718
Come on! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Move it!

833
01:12:55,845 --> 01:12:59,557
<i>-- bear the burden of suffering for the few.</i>

834
01:12:59,765 --> 01:13:03,310
<i>No more will we fight the wars of the few...</i>

835
01:13:03,561 --> 01:13:05,604
<i>... through the heart of the many.</i>

836
01:13:09,442 --> 01:13:13,529
<i>I hope this card finds you all well, as it does me.</i>

837
01:13:13,738 --> 01:13:17,116
<i>I hope no one has died. Don't worry about me.</i>

838
01:13:17,366 --> 01:13:20,745
<i>One day there will be a knock on the door and it'll be me.</i>

839
01:13:21,537 --> 01:13:23,539
<i>Love, Travis.</i>

840
01:13:30,254 --> 01:13:32,006
<i>Don't you have some idea?</i>

841
01:13:32,214 --> 01:13:33,966
<i>I'm not the one who wants to talk.</i>

842
01:13:34,216 --> 01:13:38,220
<i>You must know that the reason that I didn't marry him...</i>

843
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:42,308
<i>... is because I couldn't stand to be a cause of divorce.</i>

844
01:13:45,019 --> 01:13:48,439
<i>Now he's getting a divorce anyway.</i>

845
01:13:52,193 --> 01:13:54,612
<i>Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.</i>

846
01:13:57,907 --> 01:14:00,034
<i>I do love him.</i>

847
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:05,664
<i>What about us, June?</i>

848
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:09,001
<i>Our marriage?</i>

849
01:14:11,795 --> 01:14:13,797
<i>You know our marriage wasn't legal.</i>

850
01:14:14,006 --> 01:14:17,134
<i>In the eyes of God, we are married.</i>

851
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:23,641
<i>Brock, please don't do this to me.</i>

852
01:14:26,268 --> 01:14:27,102
<i>I love him--</i>

853
01:14:36,403 --> 01:14:37,988
Damn.

854
01:14:39,532 --> 01:14:41,534
God damn!

855
01:15:22,016 --> 01:15:24,560
- Are you Iooking for some action? - Yeah.

856
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:31,192
See that guy over there?

857
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,527
Go talk to him. His name is Matthew.

858
01:15:33,736 --> 01:15:35,821
I'II be over there waiting for you.

859
01:15:40,785 --> 01:15:44,163
Your name Matthew? I want some action.

860
01:15:44,664 --> 01:15:46,082
Officer.

861
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:51,295
I swear I'm cIean. I'm just waiting here for a friend.

862
01:15:51,504 --> 01:15:53,756
You're gonna bust me for nothing, man?

863
01:15:54,006 --> 01:15:56,342
I'm not a cop. I ain't a--

864
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,761
Then why are you asking me for action?

865
01:16:01,347 --> 01:16:03,349
Because she sent me over.

866
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:08,396
I suppose that ain't a .38 you got in your sock.

867
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:10,231
.38?

868
01:16:11,941 --> 01:16:14,694
I'm cIean, man.

869
01:16:14,944 --> 01:16:17,321
Shit, you're a reaI cowboy?

870
01:16:17,822 --> 01:16:21,283
That's nice, man. AII right. That's aII right.

871
01:16:21,534 --> 01:16:25,246
15 dollars, 15 minutes. 25 dollars, half an hour.

872
01:16:26,872 --> 01:16:28,374
Shit.

873
01:16:28,749 --> 01:16:30,000
Cowboy, huh?

874
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:33,963
I once had a horse. On Coney IsIand.

875
01:16:34,213 --> 01:16:35,881
She got hit by a car.

876
01:16:38,426 --> 01:16:40,261
Well, take it or leave it.

877
01:16:40,469 --> 01:16:43,848
If you wanna save yourseIf some money, don't fuck her.

878
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:45,474
She'II be back for more.

879
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:49,645
She's 12 years old. You ain't never had no pussy like that.

880
01:16:50,521 --> 01:16:52,565
Do anything you want. Come on her...

881
01:16:52,773 --> 01:16:55,693
...fuck her in the mouth, in the ass. Come on her face.

882
01:16:55,901 --> 01:16:59,238
She'II get your cock so hard, she'II make it expIode.

883
01:17:01,323 --> 01:17:04,660
But no rough stuff. AII right?

884
01:17:09,498 --> 01:17:11,333
AII right, I'II take it.

885
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:15,171
Hey, man! Don't take out no money over here.

886
01:17:15,379 --> 01:17:16,589
You gonna fuck me?

887
01:17:16,839 --> 01:17:19,884
You're gonna fuck her. You give her the money.

888
01:17:21,302 --> 01:17:22,887
Catch you Iater, copper.

889
01:17:24,138 --> 01:17:25,055
What'd you say?

890
01:17:25,306 --> 01:17:26,390
See you Iater, copper.

891
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:29,852
I'm no cop, man.

892
01:17:31,353 --> 01:17:34,481
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.

893
01:17:37,902 --> 01:17:38,777
I'm hip.

894
01:17:39,987 --> 01:17:42,198
Funny, you don't Iook hip.

895
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,662
Have yourself a good time. Go ahead, man.

896
01:17:57,463 --> 01:17:59,506
You're a funny guy.

897
01:18:02,635 --> 01:18:04,720
But Iooks aren't everything.

898
01:18:05,137 --> 01:18:07,014
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

899
01:18:56,313 --> 01:18:58,482
The room'II cost you ten bucks.

900
01:19:11,495 --> 01:19:13,414
I'm timing you too.

901
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:33,976
Come on.

902
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:45,154
Are you really twelve?

903
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:51,285
Listen, mister, it's your time. 15 minutes ain't Iong.

904
01:19:53,829 --> 01:19:56,707
When that cigarette burns out, your time is up.

905
01:20:00,919 --> 01:20:02,337
How old are you?

906
01:20:04,298 --> 01:20:06,091
You won't tell me?

907
01:20:06,508 --> 01:20:08,177
What's your name?

908
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:09,595
Easy.

909
01:20:09,803 --> 01:20:11,138
That's not any kind of name.

910
01:20:11,388 --> 01:20:12,723
It's easy to remember.

911
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:15,392
Yeah, but what's your reaI name?

912
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:17,144
I don't Iike my reaI name.

913
01:20:17,394 --> 01:20:19,354
What's your reaI name?

914
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:24,651
Iris.

915
01:20:25,235 --> 01:20:27,154
What's wrong? It's a nice name.

916
01:20:27,738 --> 01:20:29,448
That's what you think.

917
01:20:36,622 --> 01:20:39,750
No, don't do that. Don't you remember me?

918
01:20:40,751 --> 01:20:44,087
Remember when you got into a taxi? It was a checkered taxi.

919
01:20:44,338 --> 01:20:46,381
You got in and that guy Matthew came by...

920
01:20:46,632 --> 01:20:49,092
...and he said he wanted to take you away.

921
01:20:49,343 --> 01:20:50,427
He pulled you away.

922
01:20:52,554 --> 01:20:53,805
I don't remember that.

923
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:56,350
You don't remember?

924
01:20:59,561 --> 01:21:01,146
I'm gonna get you out of here.

925
01:21:01,396 --> 01:21:03,649
We better make it or Sport will get mad.

926
01:21:03,857 --> 01:21:06,944
- How do you wanna make it? - I don't want to. Who's Sport?

927
01:21:07,152 --> 01:21:09,905
That's Matthew. I caII him Sport.

928
01:21:14,993 --> 01:21:16,995
Wanna make it Iike this?

929
01:21:22,918 --> 01:21:24,253
Listen, I...

930
01:21:24,461 --> 01:21:25,963
Can't you understand something?

931
01:21:26,213 --> 01:21:27,923
You came into my cab.

932
01:21:28,173 --> 01:21:29,758
You wanted to get out of here.

933
01:21:30,008 --> 01:21:31,426
I must've been stoned.

934
01:21:32,094 --> 01:21:33,637
Why? They drug you?

935
01:21:33,845 --> 01:21:35,264
Come off it, man.

936
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:38,892
What are you doing?

937
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:41,103
Don't you wanna make it?

938
01:21:44,356 --> 01:21:46,441
I don't wanna make it. I wanna heIp you.

939
01:21:47,526 --> 01:21:49,319
Well, I could help you.

940
01:21:53,907 --> 01:21:55,200
Damn, man!

941
01:21:55,867 --> 01:21:57,452
Goddamn it!

942
01:22:01,498 --> 01:22:04,668
Shit, man. What the hell's the matter with you?

943
01:22:05,544 --> 01:22:07,337
We don't have to make it, mister.

944
01:22:07,546 --> 01:22:09,589
Damn it! Don't you want out of here?

945
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,011
Can you understand why I'm here?

946
01:22:15,262 --> 01:22:17,472
I think I understand.

947
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:20,976
I tried to get into your cab...

948
01:22:21,184 --> 01:22:23,729
...and now you wanna come and take me away.

949
01:22:25,147 --> 01:22:26,565
Is that it?

950
01:22:26,815 --> 01:22:28,567
Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

951
01:22:28,817 --> 01:22:30,402
I can Ieave any time I want.

952
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:32,696
Then what about that one night?

953
01:22:34,781 --> 01:22:36,867
Look, I was stoned.

954
01:22:39,244 --> 01:22:41,455
That's why they stopped me.

955
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:46,168
When I'm not stoned I got no pIace eIse to go.

956
01:22:47,502 --> 01:22:49,421
So they just...

957
01:22:49,963 --> 01:22:52,132
...protect me from myself.

958
01:22:59,598 --> 01:23:01,016
I don't know.

959
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,854
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

960
01:23:07,606 --> 01:23:09,107
I understand.

961
01:23:09,357 --> 01:23:11,693
And it means something, really.

962
01:23:14,988 --> 01:23:16,823
Well look, can I see you again?

963
01:23:17,073 --> 01:23:19,367
- That's not hard to do. - Not Iike that.

964
01:23:19,618 --> 01:23:23,371
I mean, you know, reguIarIy. This is nothing for a person to do.

965
01:23:23,872 --> 01:23:25,582
How about breakfast tomorrow?

966
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:27,792
- Tomorrow? - I get up at 1:00.

967
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:30,045
One o'clock?

968
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:35,050
Well, I got that thing. I don't know--

969
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,551
Do you want to or not?

970
01:23:36,801 --> 01:23:38,803
Yeah, I want-- Okay, aII right.

971
01:23:39,012 --> 01:23:40,514
- One o'clock. - One o'clock.

972
01:23:40,764 --> 01:23:43,391
Okay. See you tomorrow.

973
01:23:44,684 --> 01:23:47,604
Oh, Iris. My name is Travis.

974
01:23:48,813 --> 01:23:50,899
Thanks a Iot, Travis.

975
01:23:52,567 --> 01:23:55,904
So Iong, Iris. See you tomorrow.

976
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:59,241
Sweet Iris.

977
01:24:23,265 --> 01:24:25,141
This is yours.

978
01:24:25,392 --> 01:24:26,977
Spend it right.

979
01:24:32,357 --> 01:24:34,192
Come back anytime, cowboy.

980
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:36,236
I wiII.

981
01:24:55,005 --> 01:24:57,674
Why do you want me to go back to my parents?

982
01:24:57,924 --> 01:24:59,384
They hate me.

983
01:24:59,592 --> 01:25:02,887
Why do you think I spIit? There ain't nothing there.

984
01:25:03,138 --> 01:25:06,599
But you can't Iive Iike this. It's a heII.

985
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,685
A girI shouId Iive at home.

986
01:25:09,519 --> 01:25:11,312
Didn't you ever hear of women's Iib?

987
01:25:11,563 --> 01:25:13,314
What do you mean, "women's lib"?

988
01:25:13,523 --> 01:25:16,401
You're a young girI. You shouId be at home now.

989
01:25:16,609 --> 01:25:18,737
You should be dressed up, going out with boys.

990
01:25:18,945 --> 01:25:20,488
You should be going to school.

991
01:25:20,739 --> 01:25:24,451
- You know, that kind of stuff. - Oh, God, are you square.

992
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:26,661
I'm not square. You're square.

993
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:28,788
You're full of shit, man.

994
01:25:28,997 --> 01:25:30,999
What do you mean? You walk out with...

995
01:25:31,207 --> 01:25:33,752
...fucking creeps, IowIifes and degenerates...

996
01:25:34,002 --> 01:25:37,422
...and you sell your little pussy for nothing, man?

997
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:39,549
For some Iow-Iife pimp?

998
01:25:39,799 --> 01:25:41,843
Stands in a hall.

999
01:25:43,136 --> 01:25:46,097
I'm square? You're the one that's square, man.

1000
01:25:46,347 --> 01:25:49,726
I don't go screw and fuck with kiIIers and junkies Iike you.

1001
01:25:50,769 --> 01:25:52,687
You call that being hip?

1002
01:25:53,563 --> 01:25:55,398
What world you from?

1003
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,154
Who's a killer?

1004
01:26:01,404 --> 01:26:03,364
That guy Sport's a killer.

1005
01:26:03,615 --> 01:26:05,033
Sport never killed nobody.

1006
01:26:05,283 --> 01:26:06,701
- He killed-- - He's a Libra.

1007
01:26:06,951 --> 01:26:08,119
He's a what?

1008
01:26:08,328 --> 01:26:11,664
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get aIong so weII.

1009
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,711
He Iooks Iike a kiIIer to me.

1010
01:26:16,961 --> 01:26:20,632
I think that Cancers make the best Iovers...

1011
01:26:21,174 --> 01:26:23,051
...but my whole family's air signs.

1012
01:26:23,259 --> 01:26:24,469
He's also a dope-shooter.

1013
01:26:25,428 --> 01:26:28,640
What makes you so high and mighty? Will you tell me that?

1014
01:26:29,224 --> 01:26:32,018
Don't you ever Iook at your own eyebaIIs in the mirror?

1015
01:26:38,107 --> 01:26:40,443
What'II you do about Sport and that oId guy?

1016
01:26:40,652 --> 01:26:42,737
- When? - When you Ieave.

1017
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:47,575
I'II just Ieave them.

1018
01:26:47,826 --> 01:26:49,661
- Just Ieave? - They got other girIs.

1019
01:26:49,869 --> 01:26:52,747
You can't just do that. What are you gonna do?

1020
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:57,085
Want me to call the cops?

1021
01:26:57,335 --> 01:26:59,837
The cops don't do nothing. You know that.

1022
01:27:00,463 --> 01:27:04,175
Sport never treated me bad. He didn't beat me up once.

1023
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:07,762
But you can't allow him to do the same to other girls.

1024
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:09,556
You can't allow him to do that.

1025
01:27:09,806 --> 01:27:11,975
He's the Iowest kind of person.

1026
01:27:12,225 --> 01:27:14,102
Somebody's got to do something to him.

1027
01:27:14,352 --> 01:27:15,812
He's the scum of the earth.

1028
01:27:16,062 --> 01:27:17,564
He's the worst...

1029
01:27:18,856 --> 01:27:21,359
...sucking scum I have ever, ever seen.

1030
01:27:24,112 --> 01:27:26,531
You know what he told me about you?

1031
01:27:28,825 --> 01:27:32,579
He called you names. He called you a little piece of chicken.

1032
01:27:35,373 --> 01:27:37,166
He doesn't mean it.

1033
01:27:39,502 --> 01:27:42,797
I'II move up to one of them communes in Vermont.

1034
01:27:47,176 --> 01:27:50,138
I never seen a commune before, but I don't know...

1035
01:27:50,388 --> 01:27:52,515
I saw...

1036
01:27:52,807 --> 01:27:55,935
...some photos once in a magazine. It didn't Iook very cIean.

1037
01:27:56,519 --> 01:27:58,438
Why don't you come with me?

1038
01:27:58,688 --> 01:28:02,233
What? Come to the commune with you? No, no.

1039
01:28:02,442 --> 01:28:03,860
Why not?

1040
01:28:05,737 --> 01:28:08,489
I don't go to pIaces Iike that.

1041
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:09,615
Come on, why not?

1042
01:28:09,866 --> 01:28:11,868
I don't get aIong with peopIe Iike that.

1043
01:28:12,368 --> 01:28:13,870
Are you a Scorpion?

1044
01:28:14,495 --> 01:28:17,832
That's it. You're a Scorpion. I can teII every time.

1045
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:21,002
Besides, I gotta stay here.

1046
01:28:21,252 --> 01:28:22,128
Come on. Why?

1047
01:28:22,337 --> 01:28:24,005
I got something important to do.

1048
01:28:24,213 --> 01:28:25,798
So what's so important?

1049
01:28:27,633 --> 01:28:29,927
Doing something for the government.

1050
01:28:30,762 --> 01:28:33,014
The cab thing is just part-time.

1051
01:28:34,182 --> 01:28:35,683
Are you a narc?

1052
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,312
Do I Iook Iike a narc?

1053
01:28:42,523 --> 01:28:44,317
I am a narc.

1054
01:28:45,443 --> 01:28:48,905
God! I don't know who's weirder, you or me.

1055
01:28:55,203 --> 01:28:59,207
- Sure you don't wanna come with me? - I'II give you the money to go.

1056
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:02,460
- You don't have to. - I want you to take it.

1057
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:05,463
I don't want you to take anything from them.

1058
01:29:05,797 --> 01:29:07,507
And I wanna do it.

1059
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,259
I don't have anything better to do with my money.

1060
01:29:12,136 --> 01:29:14,430
I might be going away for a whiIe.

1061
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:43,459
You're just a IittIe tense, that's aII.

1062
01:29:43,709 --> 01:29:46,170
I don't Iike what I'm doing, Sport.

1063
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:49,382
Baby, I never wanted you to Iike what you're doing.

1064
01:29:49,632 --> 01:29:53,553
If you ever Iiked what you were doing, you wouIdn't be my woman.

1065
01:29:55,263 --> 01:29:57,765
You never spend any time with me anymore.

1066
01:29:57,974 --> 01:30:01,060
Well, I got to attend to business, baby.

1067
01:30:02,103 --> 01:30:04,605
You miss your man, don't you?

1068
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,360
I don't Iike to be away from you either.

1069
01:30:09,569 --> 01:30:12,113
You know how I feeI about you.

1070
01:30:13,239 --> 01:30:15,241
I depend on you.

1071
01:30:17,618 --> 01:30:18,828
I'd be Iost without you.

1072
01:30:20,329 --> 01:30:22,748
Don't you ever forget that.

1073
01:30:32,174 --> 01:30:34,427
How much I need you.

1074
01:30:36,554 --> 01:30:38,389
Come to me, baby.

1075
01:30:48,482 --> 01:30:50,276
Let me hold you.

1076
01:30:56,824 --> 01:31:01,120
When you're close to me like this, I feel so good.

1077
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:10,296
I onIy wish every man couId know what it's Iike to be Ioved by you.

1078
01:31:15,259 --> 01:31:18,220
That every woman, everywhere...

1079
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:23,017
...had a man who Ioves her Iike I Iove you.

1080
01:31:26,854 --> 01:31:30,316
God, it's good so close.

1081
01:31:42,286 --> 01:31:44,288
You know, at times Iike this...

1082
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:47,625
...I know I'm a Iucky man.

1083
01:31:50,378 --> 01:31:53,672
Touching a woman who wants me and needs me.

1084
01:32:00,137 --> 01:32:03,057
It's onIy you that keeps me together.

1085
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,985
<i>Now I see it clearly. My whole life is pointed...</i>

1086
01:33:38,235 --> 01:33:41,947
<i>... in one direction. I see that now.</i>

1087
01:33:42,197 --> 01:33:45,242
<i>There never has been any choice for me.</i>

1088
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:21,362
Ladies and gentlemen...

1089
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:25,824
...the next president of the U.S., Senator Charles Palantine.

1090
01:34:32,247 --> 01:34:33,582
Thank you, Tom.

1091
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:36,001
Ladies and gentlemen...

1092
01:34:37,002 --> 01:34:41,340
...we are met today at a crossroads, Columbus Circle.

1093
01:34:41,548 --> 01:34:43,675
This is no ordinary place.

1094
01:34:43,926 --> 01:34:48,722
It is a pIace where many roads and many Iives intersect.

1095
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:52,559
It is appropriate that we meet here today...

1096
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:56,105
...because these are not ordinary times.

1097
01:34:56,355 --> 01:35:00,234
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1098
01:35:00,818 --> 01:35:04,738
For far too Iong, the wrong roads have been taken.

1099
01:35:04,988 --> 01:35:09,243
The wrong roads have Ied us into war, into poverty...

1100
01:35:09,493 --> 01:35:12,329
...into unemployment and inflation.

1101
01:35:13,205 --> 01:35:16,917
Today I say to you, we have reached the turning point.

1102
01:35:20,671 --> 01:35:24,883
No Ionger wiII we, the peopIe, suffer for the few.

1103
01:35:33,058 --> 01:35:37,354
I wouId Iie to you if I toId you the new roads wouId be easy.

1104
01:35:38,021 --> 01:35:40,107
They will not be easy.

1105
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:43,861
Nothing that is right and good has ever been easy.

1106
01:35:44,111 --> 01:35:46,113
We, the people, know that.

1107
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:54,329
And we, the people, know the right roads and the good.

1108
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:59,668
Today I say to you, we are the peopIe, you and I.

1109
01:35:59,877 --> 01:36:03,172
And it is time to Iet the peopIe ruIe!

1110
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,631
Thank you.

1111
01:36:20,731 --> 01:36:23,150
AII right, Iet him through. PuII back.

1112
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:45,756
Over there. Get that man.

1113
01:36:48,091 --> 01:36:49,718
Give him some air!

1114
01:36:50,385 --> 01:36:52,346
Give him some air, will you?

1115
01:36:52,596 --> 01:36:54,514
- I never saw him. - I saw him run.

1116
01:36:54,765 --> 01:36:56,683
- I saw him. - Where was he?

1117
01:37:23,293 --> 01:37:24,461
What's happening?

1118
01:37:24,711 --> 01:37:26,004
Got the money?

1119
01:37:37,265 --> 01:37:38,725
Iris in her room?

1120
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:17,722
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1121
01:38:17,931 --> 01:38:20,016
Okay, okay, my man. How--

1122
01:38:21,518 --> 01:38:24,438
- Where do I know you from, man? - I don't know.

1123
01:38:24,646 --> 01:38:26,898
How's everything in the pimp business?

1124
01:38:28,108 --> 01:38:29,192
Do I know you?

1125
01:38:29,443 --> 01:38:30,277
No.

1126
01:38:30,485 --> 01:38:31,903
Do I know you?

1127
01:38:32,195 --> 01:38:34,030
Get out of here. Get Iost.

1128
01:38:34,281 --> 01:38:35,866
Do I know you?

1129
01:38:38,201 --> 01:38:39,619
How's Iris?

1130
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,288
You know Iris.

1131
01:38:41,496 --> 01:38:44,207
No, I don't know nobody named Iris.

1132
01:38:44,416 --> 01:38:46,501
Iris? Come on, get out of here, man.

1133
01:38:47,002 --> 01:38:49,004
You don't know Iris?

1134
01:38:49,254 --> 01:38:51,715
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1135
01:38:52,215 --> 01:38:53,466
No?

1136
01:38:54,009 --> 01:38:56,344
Get back to your tribe before you get hurt.

1137
01:38:56,595 --> 01:38:59,014
I don't want no troubIe, okay?

1138
01:39:00,515 --> 01:39:01,933
You got a gun?

1139
01:39:03,185 --> 01:39:06,313
Get the fuck out of here, man. Get out of here.

1140
01:39:06,771 --> 01:39:08,398
Suck on this.

1141
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:24,724
You crazy son of a bitch!

1142
01:40:24,974 --> 01:40:26,393
Fucking son of a bitch!

1143
01:40:26,643 --> 01:40:28,478
I'II kiII you!

1144
01:40:28,687 --> 01:40:31,272
I'II kiII you! I'II kiII you!

1145
01:40:32,774 --> 01:40:34,442
I'II fucking kiII you!

1146
01:40:34,651 --> 01:40:35,568
Son of a bitch!

1147
01:40:35,819 --> 01:40:36,778
I'II kiII you!

1148
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:59,342
You fucking bastard! I'II kiII you!

1149
01:40:59,592 --> 01:41:03,263
You crazy son of a bitch! I'II kiII you!

1150
01:41:24,492 --> 01:41:25,493
Don't shoot him!

1151
01:46:05,022 --> 01:46:06,524
<i>Dear Mr. Bickle.</i>

1152
01:46:06,774 --> 01:46:10,695
<i>I can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma and I were...</i>

1153
01:46:10,903 --> 01:46:13,864
<i>... to hear that you are well and recuperating.</i>

1154
01:46:14,115 --> 01:46:16,951
<i>We tried to visit you at the hospital...</i>

1155
01:46:17,201 --> 01:46:19,912
<i>... when we were in New York to pick up Iris...</i>

1156
01:46:20,162 --> 01:46:22,748
<i>...but you were still in a coma.</i>

1157
01:46:22,999 --> 01:46:25,084
<i>There is no way we can repay you...</i>

1158
01:46:25,292 --> 01:46:28,421
<i>... for returning our Iris to us.</i>

1159
01:46:28,671 --> 01:46:30,339
<i>We thought we had lost her...</i>

1160
01:46:30,589 --> 01:46:33,718
<i>...and now our lives are full again.</i>

1161
01:46:34,218 --> 01:46:35,553
<i>Needless to say...</i>

1162
01:46:35,803 --> 01:46:40,307
<i>...you are something of a hero around this household.</i>

1163
01:46:41,017 --> 01:46:44,520
<i>I'm sure you want to know about Iris.</i>

1164
01:46:44,729 --> 01:46:48,274
<i>She's back in school and working hard.</i>

1165
01:46:48,524 --> 01:46:51,569
<i>The transition has been very hard for her...</i>

1166
01:46:51,777 --> 01:46:53,696
<i>...as you can well imagine.</i>

1167
01:46:53,904 --> 01:46:56,157
<i>But we have taken steps to see...</i>

1168
01:46:56,365 --> 01:47:00,536
<i>...she has never cause to run away again.</i>

1169
01:47:01,162 --> 01:47:02,538
<i>In conclusion...</i>

1170
01:47:02,788 --> 01:47:06,500
<i>...Mrs. Steensma and I would like to again thank you...</i>

1171
01:47:06,751 --> 01:47:09,420
<i>... from the bottom of our hearts.</i>

1172
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:13,716
<i>Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again...</i>

1173
01:47:13,966 --> 01:47:17,887
<i>... to thank you in person, or we surely would.</i>

1174
01:47:18,137 --> 01:47:20,973
<i>But if you should ever come to Pittsburgh...</i>

1175
01:47:21,223 --> 01:47:25,770
<i>...you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home.</i>

1176
01:47:26,061 --> 01:47:30,983
<i>Our deepest thanks, Burt and Ivy Steensma.</i>

1177
01:47:31,901 --> 01:47:36,447
Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up and says, " I want to swap tires."

1178
01:47:36,655 --> 01:47:38,240
I say, "These are new tires.

1179
01:47:38,783 --> 01:47:41,660
Why not throw in something else, like your wife?"

1180
01:47:41,869 --> 01:47:43,621
She was Miss New Jersey, 1957.

1181
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:45,915
That's why the fleet has no spares.

1182
01:47:46,165 --> 01:47:48,542
Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.

1183
01:47:48,751 --> 01:47:51,212
- Charlie T. - What's happening?

1184
01:47:51,712 --> 01:47:53,714
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1185
01:47:55,216 --> 01:47:56,467
Shit.

1186
01:47:57,301 --> 01:47:58,719
Well, see you later.

1187
01:47:58,969 --> 01:48:00,596
See you, Travis.

1188
01:48:21,742 --> 01:48:23,536
Hello, Travis.

1189
01:48:24,954 --> 01:48:26,205
Hello.

1190
01:48:47,101 --> 01:48:49,812
I hear PaIantine got the nomination.

1191
01:48:51,105 --> 01:48:54,191
Yeah, won't be Iong now. Seventeen days.

1192
01:48:55,276 --> 01:48:57,111
Well, I hope he wins.

1193
01:49:10,749 --> 01:49:13,836
I read about you in the papers. How are you?

1194
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:19,425
It was nothing, reaIIy. I got over that.

1195
01:49:21,927 --> 01:49:24,430
Papers always blow these things up.

1196
01:49:26,265 --> 01:49:29,518
Just a IittIe stiffness. That's aII.

1197
01:50:05,763 --> 01:50:07,014
Travis...

1198
01:50:08,515 --> 01:50:09,767
I'm...

1199
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,189
How much was it?

1200
01:50:24,364 --> 01:50:25,616
So Iong.
