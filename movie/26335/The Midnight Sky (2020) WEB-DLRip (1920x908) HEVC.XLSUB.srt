You subscribe to the idea that the formative years...

but if you don't go back and see what's real and what's not real,

165
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,971

then you're missing your way into reality,

166
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,099

which is what spirituality is all about, as far as I'm concerned.

167
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,727

It's distinguishing what's real from what's not real.

168
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,437

And that's why a teacher is needed,

-So-- -What's the river?

00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,777

It's reality, with its...

00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,531
����˵������㿴����������磬

316
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:54,495
��ᷢ����һֱ�ڲ��ϱ仯��
you'll see that it's constantly changing and transforming all the time.

00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,503

But you can't unless you're in presence.

320
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,173

Because if you're in your mental thinking mind,

321
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,176

it's your ordinary mind and you won't be able to do it.

Right.

323
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,764

So, it's just really easy.

324
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,641

You can move back and forth

Right. And that thing outside of space and time is...

00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,446

00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,243

'Cause all of that is just...

00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,521

Just, "Hmm, I wonder..." something.

"I wonder how come blah, blah, blah."

00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,863

And, generally speaking, the very first thing that is gonna come up

00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,197

is a judgment about it.

00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,265

388
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,691

they try to punish everyone around them with the thing that they got.

-Exactly. -Right.
