1
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,541
<i>Still time to change your mind.</i>

2
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,916
<i>Like a race to see who'd die first.</i>

3
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,916
Terminal patient
outlives the rest of humanity.

4
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,958
Someone should
put you in a medical journal.

5
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,375
Nobody around to read it.

6
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,125
If you stop the transfusions,
you won't last a week.

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,166
If I was in a hurry to die,
I'd go with you.

8
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,500
- We all want to be home.
- Where is that?

9
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,041
Well, for you, I guess that's here.

10
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,541
As good a place as any.

11
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,083
<i>Ana? Ana!</i>

12
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,833
- Leave everything behind.
- Ana! Ana?

13
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,041
- Leave all belongings behind.
- Ana!

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,541
- My little girl is missing!
- What?

15
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,625
- I can't find my daughter. She isn't here.
- What's the problem?

16
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,958
I can't find her!

17
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,000
- Katherine!
- Ana?

18
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,541
- She already left.
- What?

19
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,833
They put her on another helicopter.
I saw her.

20
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,791
- What? She was alone?
- No, with Doctor Rogg.

21
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,500
He said to tell you
he will meet you on the ground.

22
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,125
- We have to go.
- Come on.

23
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,916
<i>Are you checking off names?</i>

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,958
Nobody gave me a list.
I just put people on the chopper.

25
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,833
What about him?

26
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,375
He's staying.

27
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,583
Let's go!

28
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,541
<i>In our galaxy alone,</i>
<i>there are billions of stars,</i>

29
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,291
<i>each one a sun to its own solar system.</i>

30
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,625
And most of those suns have planets,

31
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,708
{\an8}so it stands to reason that

32
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,875
{\an8}of these hundreds of billions
of exoplanets that exist in our galaxy,

33
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,458
{\an8}at least one of them
has the potential to support life.

34
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,291
This is K-23,
Jupiter's previously undiscovered moon.

35
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,250
Not quite an exoplanet.

36
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,625
The moon's atmosphere
is governed not by the sun,

37
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,541
but by its thermal volcanic activity.

38
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,291
In simpler terms,
when studying K-23's lunar spectrum,

39
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,416
its biomarkers and water vapors,

40
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,250
{\an8}it appears as though
it's being heated from the inside out.

41
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,750
While further probing will need to test
for atmospheric habitability,

42
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,750
we can confidently say

43
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,000
{\an8}that based on its mass,
radial velocity, and orbit,

44
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,666
{\an8}it could be just right.

45
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,875
I haven't met him personally,

46
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,500
{\an8}but I gathered research for his partner
years ago, read his papers.

47
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,000
{\an8}Was that at Oxford?

48
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,500
No, Michigan.

49
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,583
Oh, Michigan.

50
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,583
Very cold.

51
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,416
{\an8}Yeah. Have you been?

52
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,291
What are you drinking?

53
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,166
Whiskey. What are you drinking?

54
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,083
Same as you.

55
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,000
{\an8}There's a place called Portobello Beach.

56
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,416
{\an8}- Have you heard of this?
- No.

57
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,583
{\an8}It's so beautiful. You should go there.
Just off the coast near Edinburgh.

58
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,166
In the height of summer,
it's probably gonna be raining.

59
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,000
- It's a tourist trap.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

60
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,291
You should go to the beach.

61
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,791
- It's beautiful.
- I will.

62
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:15,291
{\an8}But, um, while I have you,
can I ask you a very serious question

63
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,833
{\an8}about your very serious book?

64
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,541
How much of
what you're searching for is reality,

65
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,666
and how much of your planet is just

66
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,875
bullshit?

67
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,500
List active missions.

68
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,625
<i>Neowise, inactive.</i>

69
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,333
<i>Voyager 3, inactive.</i>

70
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,041
<i>International Space Station, evacuated.</i>

71
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,000
<i>Orion 2, inactive.</i>

72
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,125
<i>Aether, active.</i>

73
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,666
<i>Geofen 3, inactive.</i>

74
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,333
<i>- Jason 4...</i>
- Show me Aether.

75
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,791
How long till Aether's
in range for direct contact?

76
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,958
<i>Aether will be</i>
<i>in range in 11 hours and 54 minutes.</i>

77
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,291
- Set an alarm for notification.
<i>- Alarm is set.</i>

78
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,416
On my way.

79
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,583
No! Wait!

80
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,958
Ade!

81
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,333
Wait! I'm here!

82
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,458
You awake, Maya?

83
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm awake. How are you feeling?

84
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,750
Like a moose.

85
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,291
- Morning, Sully.
- I'm not speaking to you.

86
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,500
Why is that?

87
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,000
I had a dream you left me
on K-23, so I'm not talking to you.

88
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,750
- You started early.
- Champions never rest.

89
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,166
You still trying to beat your boys' times?

90
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,458
- They pay you to distract me, don't they?
- Nah, I do it for free.

91
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,916
- You hear anything from home?
- I'm trying.

92
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,958
- Good morning, Sanchez.
- Morning, Sully.

93
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,791
Your decaf.

94
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,916
Whoa! Thank you, thank you.

95
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,041
- Anything yet?
- Nothing yet.

96
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,500
This is Aether Mission K-23,
open on all channels.

97
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,958
Does anyone copy?

98
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,625
Repeat.

99
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,083
Does anyone copy?

100
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,541
- What's she hearing?
- What frequency is this?

101
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,541
I'm running S, X, and Ka.

102
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,875
- That puts our last contact...
- Including the control blackout?

103
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,291
- Post-blackout.
- Three weeks.

104
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,666
If Mojave goes offline, then Spain
or Australia immediately grabs the signal.

105
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,791
No gaps. We're not receiving anything.

106
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,666
I've taken everything apart, rebooted
it a dozen times, and nothing works.

107
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,458
I also couldn't make contact
with the K-23 colony flight,

108
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,666
which should've been
in the air a week ago.

109
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,916
I mean, it could be atmospheric,

110
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,041
RF pollution,
or maybe a geomagnetic storm.

111
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:31,250
But none of that could last this long
or disrupt both hemispheres.

112
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,208
No.

113
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:53,083
Hello, this is Barbeau Observatory.
A family member has been left behind.

114
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,125
Somebody needs to come back for her.

115
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:05,416
Hello, this is Barbeau Observatory.
An outpost child has been left. Sh...

116
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,541
What's your name?

117
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,333
Your name... What's your name?

118
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,500
She's a...
She's an unidentified child.

119
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,416
She's seven or eight. She's alone.

120
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,833
Somebody has to come back. Sh...

121
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,166
Is anyone out there?

122
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,541
Hey.

123
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,958
Somebody's gotta be coming back for you,

124
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,083
because I can't help you.

125
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,833
You understand?

126
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,708
I'm the wrong person.

127
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,375
I'm the wrong person.

128
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,375
Are you hungry?

129
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,833
You have any brothers or sisters?

130
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,916
You're not deaf, right?
You can hear me talking?

131
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,125
Hey.

132
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,208
Well, that's clear.

133
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,375
You just can't talk?

134
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,625
Or you won't?

135
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,333
You just want to piss me off.

136
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,125
What is that? Is that an iris?

137
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,375
Is it...

138
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:14,958
Iris?

139
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,708
Okay.

140
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,416
<i>Aether is within direct contact range.</i>

141
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
<i>There are no incoming messages.</i>

142
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,791
Come in, Aether.
This is Barbeau Observatory.

143
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,166
Are you receiving this?

144
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,875
Come in, Aether.
This is Barbeau Observatory.

145
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,375
Are you receiving this?

146
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,666
Don't... Don't touch anything.

147
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,250
Come in, Aether.
This is Barbeau Observatory.

148
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,708
Are you receiving this?

149
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
No touching.

150
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,916
Come in, Aether.

151
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,291
This is Barbeau Observatory.
Are you receiving this?

152
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,625
That's Aether.

153
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,916
It's a spaceship, far away,

154
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,500
coming back from a planet that we...

155
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,500
We hoped would be our future, but…

156
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,666
Things didn't quite turn out that way.

157
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,250
That's why I have to contact them.

158
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,833
Now, before it's too late.

159
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,833
You understand?

160
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,083
No, no, no, no.

161
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,333
This is my room.

162
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,125
This is my room.

163
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,416
Here.

164
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,583
You sleep in here.

165
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,291
No.

166
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,166
Okay.

167
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,708
The antenna's our problem.
It's not strong enough.

168
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,125
Doesn't matter
what direction we put it in.

169
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,916
They're not answering us
because they can't hear us.

170
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,916
Well, that's something.

171
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:59,250
Given all the variables,
the fact that we can't contact

172
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,041
the K-23 colony flight

173
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,541
and can't raise Mojave on any frequency,

174
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,958
our obvious conclusion must be…

175
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,750
That the fault lies with us.

176
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:17,583
<i>But we have exhausted
every possible trouble area on our side</i>

177
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,583
<i>and simply cannot find it.</i>

178
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,166
<i>If this were</i>
<i>a less experienced crew,</i>

179
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,250
<i>this ship would be in full-blown panic.</i>

180
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,833
<i>Slow down.</i>

181
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:32,041
<i>Mission Specialist Sullivan</i>
<i>is now breaking every protocol</i>

182
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,833
<i>as she attempts
to make any kind of contact,</i>

183
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:37,708
<i>including China, India…</i>

184
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:40,875
<i>And Russia.</i>

185
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,000
This action is under my direction.

186
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,208
<i>Mitchell is…</i>

187
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,125
<i>Simply the best flyer there is,</i>

188
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,833
<i>but he's anxious to get home.</i>

189
00:27:55,208 --> 00:28:01,166
<i>Maya and Sanchez are on 12-hour shifts
as they boot and reboot the comms system,</i>

190
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,250
<i>again at my order.</i>

191
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:09,125
<i>Overall, the crew's spirit remains high
as we near the end of our journey.</i>

192
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,500
<i>Our two-year mission to K-23</i>

193
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,666
<i>has us returning
with more answers than questions.</i>

194
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,916
<i>Can it sustain life? Yes.
Can it expand? Yes.</i>

195
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,875
<i>Could it be home?</i>

196
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,250
Yes, it could.

197
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,208
Every question
we set out to answer, we did…

198
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,375
<i>Except the one that lingers in the air.</i>

199
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,166
<i>"Why is it so quiet?"</i>

200
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,208
<i>Your breakfast</i>
<i>has timed out. Would you like another?</i>

201
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,583
No. Almost done.

202
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,458
I know.

203
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,458
Doesn't make much sense to me either.

204
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,500
You know, there's no rule that says
you have to touch everything.

205
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,333
Polaris.

206
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
You see it?

207
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,916
It's the most important star in the sky.

208
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,291
If you ever get lost,
it'll help you find your way.

209
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,750
I called you. You didn't answer.

210
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,791
Sorry, I was working.

211
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,166
Can't answer your phone
when you're working?

212
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,791
I can. I just didn't.

213
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,375
I called to tell you I'm not pregnant.

214
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,583
You're safe.

215
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:36,791
It was just a…

216
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,416
Possible sighting of a life-form
that ultimately proved false.

217
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,750
You want to be an explorer, Augustine.

218
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,708
To discover new worlds,
to… give life some hope.

219
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,958
But while you're doing all that,
your own life is just

220
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,416
slipping away.

221
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:09,666
And that breaks my heart.

222
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,333
But, you know…

223
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,666
I'm sure it's for the best.

224
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,708
It shouldn't be up this far.

225
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,083
Not yet.

226
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:55,000
There is an antenna
that's stronger than ours.

227
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,708
It's up north.

228
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,458
There.

229
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,500
Lake Hazen.

230
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,750
It's a weather station.

231
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,625
It's protected by this mountain range.

232
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,375
So the air might still be good.

233
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:21,833
At least for a while.

234
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,583
We get to that antenna,
somebody'll hear us.

235
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,083
It's a long way.

236
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,666
It's okay.

237
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,166
It's all right. You have to.

238
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:46,416
So do I.

239
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:49,166
Just take a deep breath.

240
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,875
That's not so bad, right?

241
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,375
Hmm? Okay.

242
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:08,250
Never take it off, no matter what.

243
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,875
<i>- Right?</i>
<i>- And I hear this, like…</i>

244
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,416
<i>- Sniffing.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

245
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,875
<i>Then I heard this voice</i>
<i>that was like, "Oh, damn, you smell good."</i>

246
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,750
- <i>What?</i>
<i>- And it was the guy!</i>

247
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,125
- <i>No way, you're lying.</i>
<i>- Why would I lie?</i>

248
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,250
- <i>He did that?</i>
<i>- No, he didn't.</i>

249
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,291
- <i>Oh my God. He did that?</i>
<i>- Yeah, he did.</i>

250
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,708
- <i>But why?</i>
<i>- 'Cause I smell good!</i>

251
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,291
<i>So, what? He was behind you?</i>

252
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:20,125
<i>He was right behind me.</i>
<i>He came down onto my neck.</i>

253
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,958
It's okay. You can come in.

254
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,916
No.

255
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,916
Come in!

256
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,916
<i> Is he hot?</i>

257
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,958
Okay.

258
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,875
<i>- If you're late, you're not hot.</i>
<i>- Yeah, but… Okay.</i>

259
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,833
<i>So you don't mind if someone's...</i>

260
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,791
<i>No, I wanted</i>
<i>to know if he was hot.</i>

261
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,000
So, this is my sister.

262
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:41,250
And that is my very,
very best friend from high school.

263
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,041
- <i> So he turns up.</i>
- Oh.

264
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,125
<i>- He turns up.</i>
- Wait for it.

265
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,416
Here it comes.

266
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:54,041
The world's smartest cat, Einstein.

267
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:58,416
<i>- Hey, baby!</i>
<i>- Hey, honeybun.</i>

268
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,083
He still likes me best.

269
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,500
<i>I need to hear what happened.</i>

270
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:07,375
- <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>- I told you, the guy with…</i>

271
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,625
<i>Is it the sniffer?</i>

272
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,916
<i>Oh, no! What?</i>

273
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,375
<i>I'm so frightened.</i>

274
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:19,583
<i>I'm so sorry for so many things.</i>

275
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,500
<i>I love you, Margaret.</i>

276
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,250
<i>I love you.</i>

277
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,083
<i>I love you.</i>

278
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,458
<i>Do you want to change games?</i>

279
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,875
<i>- I'm on about a two-month winning streak.</i>
<i>- I'm pacing myself.</i>

280
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:45,291
I got into NASA
'cause I was damn good at mathematics.

281
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:48,166
Now, I don't like to
use the word "prodigy," but...

282
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah, I read your bio.

283
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:53,333
You also broke the family dog's leg
when you strapped it to a wooden rocket.

284
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,625
- That's irrelevant.
- Not to the dog.

285
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,583
Did you know there are
over 60 billion possible combinations

286
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,666
of rummy hands at the start of the game?

287
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,958
So this little streak you're on…

288
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:12,208
A streak that's lasted from
one side of the universe to the other.

289
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,166
…Is nothing more than
a minuscule blip of luck

290
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,166
among 60 billion possible combinations.

291
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,500
But when you apply…

292
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,916
Genius-level math skills to the equation,

293
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,916
you can shift

294
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,333
those combinations to your favor.

295
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,208
Hmm. And that is what you're doing now?

296
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,666
Overpowering me with math?

297
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,583
You, my friend,

298
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:42,250
are what my fellow mathematicians
refer to as… a simpleton.

299
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,500
Oh! A simpleton!

300
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:57,375
- We've deviated off course.
- How far?

301
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,541
Can't tell yet.
Auto-deactivated at some point.

302
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:03,125
<i>Shut us down. Kill the engines</i>
<i>before we get completely sideways.</i>

303
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,625
- Problem with navigation.
- So we're off course. How far?

304
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,666
No idea.

305
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay, we'll need to figure that out.

306
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,666
What is the variance for the alarm?

307
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,041
- 0.4 degrees.
- And it sounded for what? 80 seconds?

308
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:24,291
- <i>At 30,000 miles per hour.</i>
- Plus coast speed after engine kill.

309
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,791
Guidance and telemetry are...

310
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,833
- Non-existent without comms.
- Sanchez, shut off the alarm.

311
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,833
Sully? What do you hear?

312
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:49,666
<i>Jupiter probes,</i>
<i>the beacon we left behind at K-23,</i>

313
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,625
the supply probe on its way
there now, some dying satellites...

314
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,291
We can use that.

315
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:58,958
We can reference
the K-23 beacon as our starting point.

316
00:40:59,041 --> 00:40:59,916
It's behind us.

317
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,291
We can still build a course
from there to the satellite.

318
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,208
Start building.

319
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,000
Sully, get him exact numbers
on the beacon and pulse.

320
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,208
<i>Maya,</i>
<i>help Sanchez with the course design.</i>

321
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,625
<i>And move fast.
We're drifting while we work.</i>

322
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,333
And the hits keep coming.

323
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:19,333
Ten models, ten matching results.

324
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,041
<i>You sure about the numbers?</i>

325
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:25,708
Yes.

326
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:31,500
Yeah, but it puts us in zones
that haven't been cleared for passage.

327
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,666
Any risks you're aware of?

328
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,958
Well, we know
there was meteor activity here,

329
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,750
and we can avoid that, but…

330
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,625
This area…

331
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:47,625
We haven't mapped.

332
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:49,625
Nobody's mapped it.

333
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:54,458
Anyone else have
a better idea of how to get home?

334
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,791
Okay, then. That's our course.

335
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:05,208
Okay, boss, but I sure don't like passing
through zones that haven't been cleared.

336
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,333
I sure don't either.

337
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,666
We're okay for now.

338
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:37,583
No need to keep checking it.
The air is safe here.

339
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:41,458
We're safe.

340
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:46,375
Yeah.

341
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,041
We gotta get some sleep.

342
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:54,833
You need to sleep.

343
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,666
I need to sleep.

344
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,375
Stay here.

345
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:03,916
You… gotta help me, please.

346
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,333
What?

347
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,166
Please…

348
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:18,208
Get out of here. Go!

349
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:32,791
Okay.

350
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,208
Let's go.

351
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:05,416
Take care of yourself
Goodbye!

352
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,500
Come on, then.
Let's get you in the car. Come on.

353
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:10,583
In you go.

354
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,083
Okay, sweetheart, buckle up.

355
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,666
We were on the island.

356
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:36,666
My, uh…

357
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,208
My father had a stroke,
so we wanted to spend time with him.

358
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:42,250
Mmm. I'm sorry.

359
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:46,375
Well, you know, life.

360
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,833
Did you tell her about me?

361
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:06,041
If you want her to know about you,
you can introduce yourself.

362
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:17,625
Take care of yourself, Augustine.

363
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:49,458
You know,
this machine was actually designed

364
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:53,083
to detect alien life-forms
that might invade our system.

365
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:55,375
That sounds about right.

366
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,416
You wanna know if it's a girl or a boy?

367
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,166
Absolutely not.

368
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,916
<i>We're having a girl.</i>

369
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,291
A girl?

370
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:10,541
Nervous?

371
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:12,791
Are you?

372
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,750
I just didn't see this coming.

373
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,791
Well, you're only human.

374
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,333
Are you saying I couldn't help myself?

375
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,000
- No, you said that, not me.
- Did I say that?

376
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,416
I didn't see it coming either.

377
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,833
So, what are we gonna name her?

378
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:37,666
Trudy?

379
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,750
Roxy?

380
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,958
Penelope?

381
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,791
Margot?

382
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,500
Maggie?

383
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,333
Henrietta?

384
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,916
This'll do.

385
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,291
For now.

386
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,916
Is that your mom?

387
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,041
I knew a face like that once.

388
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:37,208
Yeah. Her hair was
a little different shade, but…

389
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,958
She was as loud as you are quiet.

390
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,833
When she'd laugh,
everybody would turn and look.

391
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:52,875
I think she'd laugh so much

392
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:57,166
because she was that much smarter
than everybody else, and she knew it.

393
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:06,791
I wish you'd tell me
something about your life, Iris.

394
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,666
Anything would do.

395
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,333
Hey, Iris.

396
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:19,958
Ask me a question.

397
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:25,833
Did you love her?

398
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:27,875
Run!

399
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,541
We shouldn't have stopped.

400
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:14,125
It's all we have.

401
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,791
No, thank you.

402
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:26,958
I like these better.

403
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,250
When we get to Lake Hazen,

404
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:45,125
there's gonna be every kind of food there.

405
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,166
There's gonna be

406
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,458
pizza…

407
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,541
And cheeseburgers.

408
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:58,875
Anything you want.

409
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:03,958
No peas.

410
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:25,250
We keep going in that direction.

411
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:29,083
Come on.

412
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:14,083
It's all right.

413
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,166
We're gonna be fine.

414
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:21,791
We'll be fine.

415
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,041
I see you!

416
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:27,333
I see you!

417
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:39,958
Iris?

418
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:44,083
Iris? I'm here!

419
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,416
Come to my voice!

420
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,083
I'm here.

421
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:57,791
There's no tracks.

422
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,208
Iris!

423
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:05,916
I'm here.

424
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,208
I'm here!

425
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:18,375
I'm here.

426
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:25,250
Iris?

427
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,708
I thought I'd lost you.

428
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,833
I thought I'd lost you.

429
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,208
Look what you did.

430
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:44,708
All good?

431
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,791
Just going where Sanchez tells me to go.

432
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,375
Anything from Sully?

433
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:56,791
Nothing yet. It's just a glitch.

434
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,208
You really believe that?

435
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:03,541
Until someone tells me different, Tom.

436
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,208
I understand it's a girl.

437
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:15,166
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

438
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Hyacinth.

439
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:26,208
What?

440
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,208
It was my mother's name.

441
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's a flower.

442
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:38,625
- Hyacinth?
- Hmm.

443
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,250
Some kind of flower.

444
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:08,416
<i>81-40 North.</i>

445
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,125
<i>72-58 West.</i>

446
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:13,041
<i>Are you there?</i>

447
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:20,083
This is the spaceship Aether
returning from Jupiter Mission.

448
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:22,291
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yes.

449
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,250
Yes. I'm receiving.

450
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,458
This is Lake Hazen Weather Station.

451
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:34,666
Lake Hazen, I can't tell you
how happy I am to hear your voice.

452
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:37,916
For some reason, you're the only person
who wants to talk to me.

453
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,333
We've lost contact with NASA
and everyone else.

454
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:43,416
<i>Do you have information
on our transmission blackout?</i>

455
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,833
Lake Hazen, are you there?

456
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:53,041
How much have you picked up
about the conditions on Earth?

457
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,541
We've received nothing.

458
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:58,041
<i> I wish I...</i>

459
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,416
I'm sorry, Lake Hazen,
I missed that last transmission.

460
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,041
Is that Mission Control?

461
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,291
Lake Hazen, are you receiving this?

462
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:16,458
I don't know all the details.
I know it was a mistake.

463
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,250
<i>It started with...</i>

464
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:21,666
<i>…also...</i>

465
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:31,958
Lake Hazen, do you copy?

466
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,625
- What is it?
- I can't pull it up on radar.

467
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:53,250
- Can you rotate on this axis?
- Trying now.

468
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,916
What the hell is that?

469
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,166
It's what happens
when you fly in the goddamn dark.

470
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:12,250
Aether? Mission Specialist Sullivan,
do you copy? Hello?

471
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:14,000
Lake Hazen, can you hear me?

472
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,000
Lake Hazen, do you copy?

473
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:49,291
Stay on current
to assess any damage beyond the comms.

474
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It's over.

475
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:56,083
For now.

476
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,708
Sully, bridge status.

477
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,875
Contained. There's damage to a lab wall.

478
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:05,166
<i>What's the status on</i>
<i>secondary and tertiary communications?</i>

479
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,916
Lost communications.

480
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:10,666
And lost radar.

481
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,125
Son of a bitch.

482
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:22,500
Full reports on all systems,
and let's at least get the radar fixed.

483
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:24,208
On it.

484
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,208
Let's see what we got.

485
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:33,708
There's the lab wall.

486
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,041
The printer can fix that.

487
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:41,500
That's the radar.

488
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,125
Okay.

489
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:53,041
And there's the comms.

490
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:56,541
And there's the comms.

491
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,125
It can be rebuilt.

492
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:06,958
But it's gonna take a walk outside.

493
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,791
Where did you get this?

494
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,875
Stole it from the LM platform support.

495
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:01,875
NASA can worry about how to unload
their supply canisters when we get back.

496
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,458
That should do the trick.

497
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,958
- Hey, Maya?
- Hmm?

498
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,875
What do you think of the name Caroline?

499
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:15,333
Uh, it's okay.

500
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,291
Better than Hyacinth?

501
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:20,166
- Yeah.
- Yup.

502
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:21,833
How are we doing?

503
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:23,583
Should come in under the deadline.

504
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:26,458
I've been thinking.
It's gotta be me and Maya going out.

505
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:31,250
Okay, I'll probably tag along,
help carry that thing.

506
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:35,375
There's no gravity out there. It's not
gonna be too heavy for us girls to handle.

507
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,125
I don't like to miss a chance
to stroll around the block.

508
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,708
Is he going because he's worried about you
or because I've never walked before?

509
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:52,416
You've trained for this.

510
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,291
He wouldn't send you out
if he wasn't sure you could do it.

511
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:59,708
Good. As long as one of us is.

512
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,375
That's her fourth.

513
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:17,958
I mean, she's so small.
Where does it all keep coming from?

514
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:24,583
How you feeling?

515
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,125
I could throw up again.

516
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,041
Now you know how I feel.

517
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,583
Do it now
before you secure the helmet.

518
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:37,583
It's a bitch to get off.

519
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,208
- You need help?
- Uh-huh.

520
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,458
Thanks.

521
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,458
Now that's just wrong.

522
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,041
You good, Maya?

523
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:21,916
We can go as fast or slow
as you're comfortable out here.

524
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,333
That goes for you too, Sully.

525
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,458
No rush, understood?

526
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:36,958
Oh my God.

527
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:39,708
No view quite like it.

528
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:04,000
- <i>There's your radar.</i>
- Yep.

529
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,791
<i>The installation site</i>
<i>should be coming up.</i>

530
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:46,833
<i>I see it.</i>

531
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:55,208
Twenty-five meters.

532
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:58,333
<i>Twenty meters.</i>

533
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,208
Got eyes on the antenna site.

534
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:41,291
<i> Hey, Sully.</i>
<i>What do you think of the name Florence?</i>

535
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:44,500
The kids would call her "Flo."

536
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,291
Yeah, good point.

537
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:50,583
How's the radar look?

538
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:54,250
Might just be knocked loose.

539
01:16:55,916 --> 01:17:00,666
We've got some detached wires,
but the nose is intact.

540
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:05,250
I'm sorry? Did you say "the nose"?

541
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,833
<i>Everybody's a critic.</i>

542
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:14,250
- Hey, Sanchez.
- Yep?

543
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:16,208
How about a little inspiration?

544
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:19,875
Ooh.

545
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:22,708
Yeah, I think I might have
the song for you.

546
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:26,125
<i>Uh, right here. Here you go. Enjoy, kids.</i>

547
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:32,541
Oh, yeah.

548
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:38,958
I don't know this song.

549
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,458
Nope, don't know it.

550
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:10,666
Okay, Mitchell,
let's see if we've got any radar.

551
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,708
Copy that. Give me a second.

552
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,750
All right, fantastic.
Rebooting now.

553
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,458
Woo-hoo!

554
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:22,500
I am in the wrong profession.

555
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:24,458
I've been saying that for two years.

556
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:27,208
Maya, are we secure?

557
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,041
Yeah, just let me
finish this last connection.

558
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:32,666
Let's get back
and see who wants to talk to us.

559
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,416
- Sully, you take the lead.
- Okay.

560
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:43,416
Okay, everybody, good job. Sanchez?

561
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,833
Can't tell about comms,
but radar looks like...

562
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,833
What do we got?

563
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:55,000
Maya, move!

564
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:08,000
Ade, you need to move fast.
You need to go.

565
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:10,208
- Get out of there.
- Go now, Ade!

566
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:13,541
- <i>Maya! Get out of there now!</i>
- I'm stuck!

567
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:16,750
Maya! Move!

568
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:45,666
Sully!

569
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,458
I'm here, Ade!

570
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:01,041
That's it.

571
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,208
It's over.

572
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:08,458
<i>Is everybody all right? Everybody safe?</i>

573
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,375
- You okay?
- Son of a bitch!

574
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:13,833
What the fuck?

575
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:15,541
Okay, okay.

576
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:18,875
Let's get inside
before Maya breaks something else.

577
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,000
Me?

578
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,583
Status report?

579
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,250
Radar is still up, and…

580
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,666
Comms is still up.

581
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,666
Punching in now. Fingers crossed on comms.

582
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:41,875
Ugh, I need a drink.

583
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:46,708
I am gonna celebrate
the first and last time I walk in space.

584
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:50,583
No, no, I'm gonna have two drinks.

585
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:52,375
<i>We could all use a drink.</i>

586
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,083
<i>Who said that?</i>

587
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:57,791
<i>Sully.</i>

588
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,375
Help me.

589
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:28,708
Help... Help me.

590
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:29,833
Maya?

591
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,083
Maya?

592
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:46,541
I'm bleeding.

593
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,333
<i>Penetration wound.</i>

594
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:14,041
<i>Sanchez, have med-pack ready
to meet us in the airlock.</i>

595
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,666
Sanchez is on it.

596
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:18,291
Ade, her oxygen levels are falling fast.

597
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,458
Let's get her tied down.

598
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:33,625
- What did I do wrong?
- You didn't do anything wrong.

599
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:38,958
Okay.

600
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,208
You're gonna be fine.

601
01:23:47,916 --> 01:23:49,208
Is it bad?

602
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:51,833
Let's get this backpack off.

603
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:55,875
- Just breathe, Maya.
- Sanchez, get that med-pack in here!

604
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:08,125
Come on, come on.

605
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,166
Just breathe.

606
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:14,583
That's it.

607
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,375
Thirty seconds!

608
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:19,625
I'm with you. Look at me. I'm with you.

609
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,791
- I'm gonna take your helmet off.
- Okay.

610
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:23,791
- Okay? You're gonna be fine.
- Okay.

611
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,458
Twenty seconds.

612
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:29,708
Just breathe.

613
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:32,666
How long have we got? That's it.

614
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:35,291
Ten seconds! Come on!

615
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:45,583
Now! Go! Clear!

616
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,875
- That's too much blood.
- It's okay.

617
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:16,625
- There's too much blood.
- You're okay.

618
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:19,375
- We don't have time. Put pressure.
- Here? Hang on.

619
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:21,500
- I got it.
- You got her?

620
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:24,708
There's too much blood.
Too much blood.

621
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:29,208
- I got it.
- You're gonna be fine. Okay?

622
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,416
- Maya? Maya, breathe.
- Hmm?

623
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,708
Maya, please breathe. Okay?

624
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:36,833
Puncture wound to the lower back.

625
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:38,416
Maya?

626
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:43,333
Maya?

627
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:45,166
- Maya?
- Yes?

628
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:48,500
You're gonna be fine.

629
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:50,791
- You're gonna be fine. Yes.
- No.

630
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,166
- Maya.
- Why won't the blood stop?

631
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:56,291
<i>Keep looking at me.</i>

632
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,333
- Maya.
- I have to stay here.

633
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,541
- Okay, hold on.
- Mitchell, get us ready.

634
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:05,958
Maya. Keep looking at me.
Maya. Maya. Breathe.

635
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:10,083
- Please.
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

636
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,250
Maya.

637
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:21,000
<i>Just breathe. Breathe.</i>

638
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:22,500
<i>Maya. Maya.</i>

639
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:30,833
Lake Hazen, this is Aether.
Are you receiving?

640
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:24,916
<i>Captain,</i>
<i>we just got our first view of Earth.</i>

641
01:30:28,916 --> 01:30:33,916
I tied into the signals
of the old Astron satellite telescope.

642
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,666
What do we do?

643
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:10,666
<i>Lake Hazen,</i>
<i>this is Aether. Are you receiving?</i>

644
01:31:13,791 --> 01:31:15,208
<i>I repeat,</i>

645
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:19,375
<i>Lake Hazen, this is Aether.
Are you receiving this transmission?</i>

646
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:24,500
<i>Lake Hazen, do you copy?</i>

647
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:27,208
Yes, Aether.

648
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:30,625
<i>Our comm system went offline.</i>

649
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:37,125
We're operational now
and just got a visual on Earth.

650
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:45,458
I'm afraid we didn't do a good job

651
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,875
of looking after the place
while you were away.

652
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:52,000
<i>Do you see any new data</i>

653
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:54,541
<i>that suggests possible
safe entry points for us?</i>

654
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,333
No.

655
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:06,875
<i>All survivable areas are underground.</i>

656
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:09,916
<i>And those are temporary.</i>

657
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,791
I'd like to suggest something.

658
01:32:23,416 --> 01:32:25,083
Does this make sense to you?

659
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:31,916
If we want to get back to K-23, yes.

660
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,666
It's actually a pretty good plan.

661
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:37,166
Deviate our approach to Earth,

662
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:41,416
then make gravity our friend
to save fuel on the turnaround.

663
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,541
- Why would we do that?
- There's nothing left for us down there.

664
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:48,000
- We're not slingshotting back into space.
- We'll die if we go back.

665
01:32:48,083 --> 01:32:50,791
- He's still alive.
- Poles will be the last areas hit.

666
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:53,250
- Air contamination is rising.
- We don't know anything.

667
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:54,583
We all saw what it looked like.

668
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:58,041
Our mission was to go to K-23,
turn around, and come home.

669
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,125
We're going home.

670
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:37,208
<i>Lake Hazen,</i>
<i>are you still picking this up?</i>

671
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,666
I'm here, Aether.

672
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:44,791
<i>Lake Hazen, this is</i>
<i>Aether Flight Commander Gordon Adewole.</i>

673
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,541
Your numbers are intriguing,

674
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:51,666
but they have me curious
as to how you came up with them,

675
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:54,458
and how you know
so much about our flight plan.

676
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:58,166
Who exactly are you?

677
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:03,666
<i> Augustine Lofthouse.</i>

678
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:10,041
Dr. Lofthouse.

679
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:15,375
I had hoped to meet you upon our return.

680
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:21,458
<i>Unfortunately, that seems
less likely as of the last few days.</i>

681
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:24,208
Yes.

682
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:30,916
<i>Given your location,</i>
<i>are you certain there are no safe regions</i>

683
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:33,083
<i>in the southern hemisphere?</i>

684
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:35,416
<i>Antarctica?</i>

685
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:39,541
No, there's nowhere.

686
01:34:51,666 --> 01:34:52,666
I'm sorry.

687
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:59,833
We'll discuss our options up here
and hopefully, speak again.

688
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:17,791
There is a message for you.

689
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:20,750
It's downloading.

690
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,041
When was it sent?

691
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:29,958
Ten days ago.

692
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,625
<i>My love, I…</i>

693
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:38,291
<i>Um, I don't know if you know
what's going on down here,</i>

694
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:42,291
<i>but, um, we're being asked to evacuate.</i>

695
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:46,000
<i>Uh… the boys are sick.</i>

696
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:49,500
<i>I…</i>

697
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,458
<i>I want you to know where we're going,</i>

698
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:58,791
<i>because I won't be able
to contact you anymore.</i>

699
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:04,208
<i>I love you… so much.</i>

700
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,083
Captain, you got a minute?

701
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:48,208
Of course.

702
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:53,750
It's funny when I think about
how long I've been doing this.

703
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,583
You know, 20 years ago, Kath and I,

704
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,041
we used to talk about the risks.

705
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:08,083
A certain amount
of danger is involved, and…

706
01:37:09,583 --> 01:37:11,375
We took that into account.

707
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:16,541
I was the one
that was supposed to be at risk.

708
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:20,833
And they were supposed to be safe.

709
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:28,166
Home…

710
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:31,500
And safe.

711
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,041
You have two reentry pods on this ship,
and I'd like to take one of them.

712
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:40,291
And you were right.

713
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,375
It's your job to turn the ship around,
start a new life.

714
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:48,041
Do better this time.

715
01:37:50,291 --> 01:37:51,458
But it's my job…

716
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:56,083
To keep a promise
that I made to my family.

717
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,375
I understand.

718
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:03,791
I'd feel the same way.

719
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:06,625
I know you would.

720
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:48,916
- It takes two to fly that.
- I'll manage.

721
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:54,833
I'm going to go with you.

722
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:06,666
- Why would you wanna do that?
- I've been thinking.

723
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:09,916
That's your first mistake.

724
01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:15,500
Been thinking a lot about time…

725
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,750
And how it gets used and why.

726
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:25,208
Why one person lives a lifetime

727
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:28,458
and another only gets a few years.

728
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:37,458
My daughter, Maria,
she died when she was four.

729
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:41,791
She would have been the same age as Maya.

730
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:47,458
Sometimes at night, when I couldn't sleep,

731
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:51,208
I would pretend that they were friends.

732
01:39:52,416 --> 01:39:54,125
They'd talk about school together.

733
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:55,750
Or boys.

734
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:11,625
I want to take Maya home.

735
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:15,833
It seems like the best use of my time.

736
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:27,833
So I was thinking I'll take
a ride home with my buddy, if that's okay.

737
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:33,083
Okay.

738
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:12,833
Bye, Sully.

739
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:19,541
Take care of yourself, okay?
And our little Caroline.

740
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,625
I hope you find your family.

741
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:15,583
Wish us luck.

742
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,083
Good luck.

743
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:32,000
This is Aether. Are you receiving?

744
01:43:35,541 --> 01:43:37,500
<i>Dr. Lofthouse, can you hear me?</i>

745
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:39,375
I hear you.

746
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:45,541
<i>We're headed into</i>
<i>an ionization blackout,</i>

747
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:47,125
<i>so I'm gonna lose you soon.</i>

748
01:43:48,708 --> 01:43:51,708
But I wanted to
contact you first to thank you.

749
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:55,541
Commander Adewole and I are turning back.

750
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,250
That's good.

751
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:08,500
<i>Captain Mitchell</i>
<i>and Specialist Sanchez decided on reentry.</i>

752
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,125
They have family down here?

753
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:16,958
<i>Yes.</i>

754
01:44:22,458 --> 01:44:23,708
<i>I understand.</i>

755
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:30,375
Flight Engineer Maya Lawrence,

756
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:33,458
she suffered
an accident during the flight.

757
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:41,208
I'm sorry.

758
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,041
What you did…

759
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:53,208
You discovered so much up here.

760
01:44:59,166 --> 01:45:00,458
I just point.

761
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:07,750
<i>Well, you pointed</i>
<i>to an incredible world.</i>

762
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:11,208
<i>I wish you could have seen it.</i>

763
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:20,333
<i> Lake Hazen will have to do.</i>

764
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:25,625
How did you end up there?

765
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:33,666
I thought maybe I could help someone.

766
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:37,583
<i>Well, you've definitely done that.</i>

767
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,708
You know, you're one of the reasons
I joined the space program.

768
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:47,916
You had done some work
with my mother, Jean Sullivan.

769
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:51,208
<i>She brought home a moon rock you gave her.</i>

770
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:55,125
<i>I thought it was
the most amazing thing ever.</i>

771
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:57,833
<i>It made me want to go up and find more.</i>

772
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:04,583
<i>I wish I could have thanked you
for it in person, Dr. Lofthouse.</i>

773
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:08,208
Augustine.

774
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:11,250
Augustine.

775
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,416
And I'm Iris.

776
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:20,708
I know.

777
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:44,583
It's very nice to finally meet you.

778
01:46:51,875 --> 01:46:53,791
<i>What's it like there, Iris?</i>

779
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:56,500
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

780
01:46:58,041 --> 01:46:59,333
It's amazing.

781
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:05,541
The colony site, it feels like Colorado.

782
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:11,125
Have you ever been there,
to the mountains?

783
01:47:12,958 --> 01:47:15,083
Yes.

784
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:20,500
<i>The air is so crisp, and…</i>

785
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:23,958
<i>And the planet has that smell.</i>

786
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:27,583
<i>It's like pine trees
are hidden somewhere underground,</i>

787
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:29,166
<i>waiting to burst through.</i>

788
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:35,125
<i>First weeks we were there,</i>

789
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:38,250
<i>I kept looking up,
expecting to see a blue sky,</i>

790
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,791
<i>but it was orange</i>

791
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,500
from the light reflecting off Jupiter.

792
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:48,041
When the orbit is just right,

793
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:51,791
<i>Jupiter feels so close that…</i>

794
01:47:54,666 --> 01:47:56,666
<i>You're sure you could almost touch it.</i>

795
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:02,750
<i>And that light, it makes
all the colors explode, everything.</i>

796
01:48:04,166 --> 01:48:05,541
<i>Water…</i>

797
01:48:07,166 --> 01:48:08,500
<i>Flowers…</i>

798
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:13,833
<i>It's like landing in Oz
and seeing real color for the first time.</i>

799
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:21,625
<i>I've never seen anything so beautiful.</i>

800
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:32,041
<i>Dr. Lofthouse?</i>

801
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:36,416
<i>Augustine?</i>

802
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:43,583
Think I lost him.

803
01:48:49,208 --> 01:48:50,708
I guess it's just us now.

804
01:48:56,125 --> 01:48:57,125
Just us?
