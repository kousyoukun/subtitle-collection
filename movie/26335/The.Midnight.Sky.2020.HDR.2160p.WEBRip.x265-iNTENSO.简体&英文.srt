00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,500
巴伯天文台

3
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,290
北极圈

4
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,330
2049年2月

5
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:34,000
事件发生三周后

6
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,900
你还有时间改变主意
Still time to change your mind.

7
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,310
这就像在比赛 看谁先死
Like a race to see who'd die first.

8
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,040
绝症病人比剩下的所有人类活得更久
Terminal patient outlives the rest of humanity.

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
应该有人把你写进医学期刊
Someone should put you in a medical journal.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,690
那时候也没人会读了
Nobody around to read it.

11
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,520
如果不输血 你撑不过一周
If you stop the transfusions, you won't last a week.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,400
如果我着急送死 就和你一起走了
If I was in a hurry to die, I'd go with you.

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,900
-我们都想回家   -家在哪？
-We all want to be home.   -Where is that?

14
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,100
对你来说 我想就是这里
Well, for you, I guess that's here.

15
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,600
这里已经很好了
As good a place as any.

16
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,980
安娜
Ana? Ana!

17
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,910
-什么都不要带   -安娜？
-Leave everything behind.   -Ana! Ana?

18
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,440
-所有行李都放下   -安娜
-Leave all belongings behind.   -Ana!

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,620
-我女儿不见了   -什么？
-My little girl is missing!   -What?

20
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,700
-我找不到我女儿了 她不见了   -出什么事了？
-I can't find my daughter. She isn't here.   -What's the problem?

21
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,040
我找不到她了
I can't find her!

22
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,080
-凯瑟琳   -安娜呢？
-Katherine!   -Ana?

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,620
-她已经走了   -什么？
-She already left.   -What?

24
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,830
他们让她上了另一架直升机
They put her on another helicopter.

25
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,910
我看见她了
I saw her.

26
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,870
-什么？她一个人？   -不 她和罗格医生在一起
-What? She was alone?   -No, with Doctor Rogg.

27
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,580
他让我转告你 着陆后见
He said to tell you he will meet you on the ground.

28
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,520
-我们得走了   -快
-We have to go.   -Come on.

29
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
在查名单吗？
Are you checking off names?

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,150
没人给过我名单 ?我只负责把人运上直升机
Nobody gave me a list. I just put people on the chopper.

31
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,020
他呢？
What about him?

32
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,770
他要留下
He's staying.

33
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,980
我们走吧
Let's go!

34
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,950
NETFLIX 出品

35
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,540
在我们的星系 就有数十亿颗恒星
In our galaxy alone, there are billions of stars,

36
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,370
每一颗都像太阳一样 ?拥有自己的太阳系
each one a sun to its own solar system.

37
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,700
这些恒星大多都有行星
And most of those suns have planets,

38
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,790
由此可见
so it stands to reason that

39
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,950
在我们星系这上千亿颗地外行星中
of these hundreds of billions of exoplanets that exist in our galaxy,

40
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,850
至少有一颗有适宜生存的潜质
at least one of them has the potential to support life.

41
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,400
这是K-23 ?木星以前未被发现的卫星
This is K-23, Jupiter's previously undiscovered moon.

42
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,330
它不是地外行星
Not quite an exoplanet.

43
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,700
卫星的大气不是由恒星控制
The moon's atmosphere is governed not by the sun,

44
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,620
而是受地热火山活动影响
but by its thermal volcanic activity.

45
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,370
简单地说 ?在研究K-23的卫星光谱
In simpler terms, when studying K-23's lunar spectrum,

46
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,810
生物标志物和水蒸气时
its biomarkers and water vapors,

47
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,370
我们发现它内部似乎有热能
it appears as though it's being heated from the inside out.

48
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,830
尽管还要进一步探究测试 ?大气的宜居性
While further probing will need to test for atmospheric habitability,

49
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,830
我们可以自信地说
we can confidently say

50
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,400
从它的质量、径向速度和轨道来看
that based on its mass, radial velocity, and orbit,

51
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,060
它就是我们要找的星球
it could be just right.

52
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,910
我还没有和他见过面
I haven't met him personally,

53
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,580
但我几年前为他的合作伙伴 ?收集过研究资料 读过他的论文
but I gathered research for his partner years ago, read his papers.

54
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,400
是在牛津吗？
Was that at Oxford?

55
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,900
不 是在密歇根
No, Michigan.

56
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,980
密歇根
Oh, Michigan.

57
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,980
那里很冷
Very cold.

58
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,810
是的 你去过吗？
Yeah. Have you been?

59
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,230
你喝的是什么？
What are you drinking?

60
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,560
威士忌 你呢？
Whiskey. What are you drinking?

61
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
我也是
Same as you.

62
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,750
波托贝洛海滩
There's a place called Portobello Beach.

63
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,500
?-你听说过吗？   -没有
-Have you heard of this?   -No.

64
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,660
那里太美了 你应该去一次 ?就在爱丁堡的海岸边
It's so beautiful. You should go there. Just off the coast near Edinburgh.

65
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,250
在仲夏时节 那里可能在下雨
In the height of summer, it's probably gonna be raining.

66
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,160
-那里专门赚游客的钱   -肯定的
-It's a tourist trap.   -Yeah, I'm sure.

67
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,910
-但是记得去海滩 很美   -我会的
-You should go to the beach. It's beautiful.   -I will.

68
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,330
?趁现在 我能问你一个 ?很严肃的问题吗？
But, um, while I have you, can I ask you a very serious question

69
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,230
关于你那本很严肃的书？
about your very serious book?

70
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,940
你在找的东西 有多少是事实
How much of what you're searching for is reality,

71
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,350
你的星球有多少信息只是…
and how much of your planet is just

72
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,150
胡扯？
bullshit?

73
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,370
改编自莉莉布鲁克斯-道尔顿 ?《永夜漂流》

74
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,020
列出运行中的任务

-Jason 4--   -Show me Aether.

82
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,290
追踪返航轨道 ?以太号-返航最终航段

83
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,870
以太号进入直接联络范围还要多久？
How long till Aether's in range for direct contact?

84
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,040
以太号将在11小时54分钟后进入范围
Aether will be in range in 11 hours and 54 minutes.

85
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,690
-设定提醒闹钟   -闹钟设置完毕
-Set an alarm for notification.   -Alarm is set.

86
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,650
马上来
On my way.

87
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,980
不 等等
No! Wait!

88
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,350
艾迪
Ade!

89
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,440
等等
Wait! I'm here!

90
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,540
你醒了吗 玛雅？
You awake, Maya?

91
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,400
我醒了 你感觉如何？
I'm awake. How are you feeling?

92
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,150
像麋鹿一样
Like a moose.

93
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,770
早 萨利
Morning, Sully.

94
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,690
我不想跟你说话
I'm not speaking to you.

95
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,500
为什么？
Why is that?

96
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,270
我梦到你把我留在K-23上了 ?所以我不想跟你说话
I had a dream you left me on K-23, so I'm not talking to you.

97
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,830
-你起得真早   -冠军从不休息
-You started early.   -Champions never rest.

98
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,250
你还在努力超过 ?你儿子们的用时排名？
You still trying to beat your boys' times?

99

-他们花钱请你来让我分心的吗？   -不 这活儿我免费干
-They pay you to distract me, don't they?   -Nah, I do it for free.

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,310
谢谢
Whoa! Thank you, thank you.

104
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,020
-收到联络了吗？   -还没有
-Anything yet?   -Nothing yet.

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,900
这里是以太号任务K-23 ?所有频道开放
This is Aether Mission K-23, open on all channels.

106
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,400
有人收到吗？
Does anyone copy?

107
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,020
重复
Repeat.

108
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,480
有人收到吗？
Does anyone copy?

109
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,620
-她听到什么了？   -这是什么频率？
-What's she hearing?   -What frequency is this?

110
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,270
我的频率设置是S、X和KA
I'm running S, X, and Ka.

111
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,160
-我们和控制中心的最后一次联络是…   -包括那次联络中断？
-That puts our last contact--   -Including the control blackout?

112
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,690
-在那之后   -三周之前
-Post-blackout.   -Three weeks.

113
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,750
如果莫哈韦站掉线 ?西班牙或澳大利亚站会立刻获取信号
If Mojave goes offline, then Spain or Australia immediately grabs the signal.

114
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,870
无间隔 我们什么都收不到
No gaps. We're not receiving anything.

115
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,980
我把所有东西拆分 ?重启了十几次 都没用
I've taken everything apart, rebooted it a dozen times, and nothing works.

116
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,540
我也联系不上K-23殖民飞船
I also couldn't make contact with the K-23 colony flight,

117
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,060
它一周前就该起飞了
which should've been in the air a week ago.

118
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,000
也许是因为大气层
I mean, it could be atmospheric,

119
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,150
广播频率污染或者地磁风暴
RF pollution, or maybe a geomagnetic storm.

120
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,520
但这些都不可能持续这么久 ?或是同时影响两个半球
But none of that could last this long or disrupt both hemispheres.

121
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,540
巴伯天文台

122
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
不
No.

123
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,160
你好 这里是巴伯天文台 ?有一名家庭成员被落下了
Hello, this is Barbeau Observatory. A family member has been left behind.

124
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,190
需要有人回来接她
Somebody needs to come back for her.

125
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,500
你好 这里是巴伯天文台 ?一名居民点的儿童被遗落…
Hello, this is Barbeau Observatory. An outpost child has been left. Sh--

126
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,940
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

127
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,190
你叫什么名字？
Your name-- What's your name?

128
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,580
她是…一名身份不明的儿童
She's a-- She's an unidentified child.

129
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,810
她大概七八岁 独自一人
She's seven or eight. She's alone.

130
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,020
必须派人回来 她是…
Somebody has to come back. Sh--

131
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,560
有人吗？
Is anyone out there?

132
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,810
嘿
Hey.

133
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,230
得有人回来接你 因为我没法照顾你
Somebody's gotta be coming back for you, because I can't help you.

134
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,980
你明白吗？
You understand?

135
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,810
我不合适
I'm the wrong person.

136
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
我不合适
I'm the wrong person.

137
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,150
你饿吗？
Are you hungry?

138
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,440
你有兄弟姐妹吗？
You have any brothers or sisters?

139
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,310
你不是聋子吧？能听见我说话吗？
You're not deaf, right? You can hear me talking?

140
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,940
嘿
Hey.

141
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,150
看来不聋
Well, that's clear.

142
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,770
你只是不会说话？
You just can't talk?

143
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,020
还是你不愿说话？
Or you won't?

144
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,730
你只是想惹我生气
You just want to piss me off.

145
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,060
那是什么？
What is that?

146
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,520
那是鸢尾花艾莉丝吗？
Is that an iris?

147
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,600
是…
Is it--

148
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,350
你叫艾莉丝？
Iris?

149
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,810
好吧
Okay.

150
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,900
以太号进入直接联络范围 ?没有接收到信息
Aether is within direct contact range. There are no incoming messages.

151
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,410
请回答 以太号
Come in, Aether.

152
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,440
这里是巴伯天文台 能收到吗？
This is Barbeau Observatory. Are you receiving this?

153
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,330
请回答 以太号
Come in, Aether.

154
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,770
这里是巴伯天文台 能收到吗？
This is Barbeau Observatory. Are you receiving this?

155
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,060
别乱碰东西
Don't-- Don't touch anything.

156
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,330
请回答 以太号 这里是巴伯天文台
Come in, Aether. This is Barbeau Observatory.

157
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,100
能收到吗？
Are you receiving this?

158
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,400
不要碰
No touching.

159
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,000
请回答 以太号
Come in, Aether.

160
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,690
这里是巴伯天文台 能收到吗？
This is Barbeau Observatory. Are you receiving this?

161
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,290
以太号

162
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,770
那是以太号
That's Aether.

163
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,310
是个宇宙飞船 离我们很远
It's a spaceship, far away,

164
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,730
它从一个星球返航 我们…
coming back from a planet that we--

165
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,940
我们本希望那里是未来的居所 但…
we hoped would be our future, but…

166
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,400
事情未遂人愿
Things didn't quite turn out that way.

167
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,650
所以我要联系他们
That's why I have to contact them.

168
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,230
现在就联系 不然就晚了
Now, before it's too late.

169
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,230
你明白吗？
You understand?

170
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,160
不
No, no, no, no.

171
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,730
这是我的房间
This is my room.

172
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,350
这是我的房间
This is my room.

173
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,690
来
Here.

174
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,560
你睡这里
You sleep in here.

175
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,650
不
No.

176
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,520
好
Okay.

177
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,790
天线是个问题 它信号不够强
The antenna's our problem. It's not strong enough.

178
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,020
无论放在什么方向都不行
Doesn't matter what direction we put it in.

179
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,310
他们不回答是因为听不到我们的信息
They're not answering us because they can't hear us.

180
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,310
也算是发出了点声音
Well, that's something.

181
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:01,440
考虑到所有变量 ?我们联系不上K-23殖民飞船
Given all the variables, the fact that we can't contact the K-23 colony flight

182
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,940
在任何频道都联系不上莫哈韦
and can't raise Mojave on any frequency,

183
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,350
我们显然可以得出结论…
our obvious conclusion must be…

184
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,150
问题出在我们这里
that the fault lies with us.

185
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,660
但我们已经排查了 ?我们这边所有可能出问题的区域
But we have exhausted every possible trouble area on our side

186
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,980
就是找不到问题
and simply cannot find it.

187
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,330
还好这里的船员们很有经验 ?不然我们现在已经彻底恐慌了
If this were a less experienced crew, this ship would be in full-blown panic.

188
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,850
慢点
Slow down.

189
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,120
任务专员萨利文现在打破一切规定
Mission Specialist Sullivan is now breaking every protocol

190
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,910
她在尝试进行任何可能的联络
as she attempts to make any kind of contact,

191
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,270
包括和中国、印度…
including China, India…

192
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,270
还有俄罗斯
and Russia.

193
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,400
这个行动是受我指示
This action is under my direction.

194
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,600
米切尔是…
Mitchell is…

195
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,520
这里最棒的飞行员
simply the best flier there is,

196
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,230
但他归心似箭
but he's anxious to get home.

197
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,560
玛雅和桑彻斯每12小时换班 ?不断重启通讯系统
Maya and Sanchez are on 12-hour shifts as they boot and reboot the comms system,

198
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,650
同样是受我指示
again at my order.

199
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,520
总的来说 随着我们的旅途接近终点 ?船员们情绪一直很好
Overall, the crew's spirit remains high as we near the end of our journey.

200
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,580
我们前往K-23 ?进行为期两年的任务
Our two-year mission to K-23

201
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,690
让我们带回的答案多于问题
has us returning with more answers than questions.

202
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,160
以太号任务轨道 4.75年 1734天

203
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,000
它可以维系生命吗？可以 ?可以扩张吗？可以
Can it sustain life? Yes. Can it expand? Yes.

204
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,650
可以成为家园吗？是的 可以
Could it be home? Yes, it could.

205
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,600
我们所有的问题都得到了回答
Every question we set out to answer, we did…

206
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,770
只有一个悬而未决的疑问
except the one that lingers in the air.

207
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,560
那里为什么这么安静？
"Why is it so quiet?"

208
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,600
你的早餐情景超时了 要续播吗？
Your breakfast has timed out. Would you like another?

209
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,980
不 我快吃完了
No. Almost done.

210
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,850
我知道
I know.

211
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,520
我也觉得不合理
Doesn't make much sense to me either.

212
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,900
没有规定说你什么都要碰
You know, there's no rule that says you have to touch everything.

213
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,520
北极星
Polaris.

214
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,730
你看到了吗？
You see it?

215
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,020
那是天上最重要的星星
It's the most important star in the sky.

216
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,690
假如你迷路了 它会帮你找到方向
If you ever get lost, it'll help you find your way.

217
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,150
我给你打电话了 你没接
I called you. You didn't answer.

218
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,190
抱歉 我当时在工作
Sorry, I was working.

219
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,190
工作的时候不能接电话？
Can't answer your phone when you're working?

220
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,190
能接 但我没接
I can. I just didn't.

221
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,770
我打电话是要跟你说 我没怀孕
I called to tell you I'm not pregnant.

222
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,980
你安全了
You're safe.

223
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,190
那只是…
It was just a…

224
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,810
可能看到了生命形式 但最终证伪
possible sighting of a life-form that ultimately proved false.

225
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,020
你想成为探险家 奥古斯丁
You want to be an explorer, Augustine.

226
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,440
发现新世界
To discover new worlds, to…

227
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,020
给生命一点希望
give life some hope.

228
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,100
但你在做这些事的同时 ?你自己的人生就…
But while you're doing all that, your own life is just

229
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,810
这样溜走了
slipping away.

230
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,730
这…
And that...

231
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,020
让我心碎
breaks my heart.

232
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,730
不过嘛
But, you know…

233
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,900
我确信这都是为了最好的未来
I'm sure it's for the best.

234
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,980
不应该到这里的
It shouldn't be up this far.

235
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,480
还没到时候
Not yet.

236
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,400
有个天线比我们的信号更强
There is an antenna that's stronger than ours.

237
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,100
在北方
It's up north.

238
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,690
那里
There.

239
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,730
哈森湖
Lake Hazen.

240
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,850
是个气象站
It's a weather station.

241
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,020
受这片山区保护
It's protected by this mountain range.

242
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,350
那里的空气也许还很好
So the air might still be good.

243
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,230
至少可以保持一阵子
At least for a while.

244
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,980
我们到那个天线那里去 ?就会有人听到我们的信息
We get to that antenna, somebody'll hear us.

245
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,480
路途很远
It's a long way.

246
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,000
未探测到信号

247
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,940
没关系
It's okay.

248
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,560
没事的 这个必须戴
It's all right. You have to.

249
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,650
我也要戴
So do I.

250
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,560
深呼吸一次
Just take a deep breath.

251
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,190
没那么难受 是吧？
That's not so bad, right?

252
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,770
好
Okay.

253
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,650
绝对不要拿下来 无论发生什么
Never take it off, no matter what.

254
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,500
-是吧？我听到像是嗅鼻子的声音   -什么？
-Right? And I hear this, like Sniffing.   -What?

255
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,040
然后我听到一个声音说 “哦 天啊 你真好闻”
Then I heard this voice that was like, "Oh, damn, you smell good."

256
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,870
-什么？   -就是那个人
-What?   -And it was the guy!

257
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,080
-不可能 你在说谎   -我为什么要说谎？
-No way, you're lying.   -Why would I lie?

258
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,330
-他闻你了？   -不 他没有
-He did that?   -No, he didn't.

259
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,370
-哦 我的天 他闻你了？   -是 他闻了
-Oh my God. He did that?   -Yeah, he did.

260
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,790
-可是为什么啊？   -因为我很好闻
-But why?   -'Cause I smell good!

261
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,330
所以呢？他在你身后？
So, what? He was behind you?

262
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,200
他就在我背后 弯下腰靠近我的脖子
He was right behind me. He came down onto my neck.

263
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,040
没关系的 你可以进来
It's okay. You can come in.

264
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,400
不了
No.

265
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,850
进来
Come in!

266
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,660
好吧
Okay.

267
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,790
如果迟到了 你就不性感了
If you're late, you're not hot.

268
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,950
是啊 可是…好吧
Yeah, but… Okay.

269
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,200
所以你不介意别人是否…
So you don't mind if someone's--

270
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,870
不 我就想知道他是否性感
No, I wanted to know if he was hot.

271
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,080
这是我姐姐
So, this is my sister.

272
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,650
这是我高中最好的朋友
And that is my very, very best friend from high school.

273
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,120
然后他出现了
-So he turns up.   -Oh.

274
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
他出现了
He turns up.

275
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,520
等一下
Wait for it.

276
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,810
来了
Here it comes.

277
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,440
世界上最聪明的猫 爱因斯坦
The world's smartest cat, Einstein.

278
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,560
嘿 宝贝 嘿 小亲亲
Hey, baby! Hey, honeybun.

279
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,480
它还是最喜欢我
He still likes me best.

280
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,040
-好 我要听听事情的经过   -什么事情？
I need to hear what happened.

281
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,450
-我不知道   -我已经说了 那个家伙…
-I don't know.   -I told you, the guy with…

282
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,700
是那个闻你的人吗？
Is it the sniffer?

283
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,310
哦 不 什么？
Oh, no! What?

284
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,770
我太害怕了
I'm so frightened.

285
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,980
我为很多事情感到抱歉
I'm so sorry for so many things.

286
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,900
我爱你 玛格丽特
I love you, Margaret.

287
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,650
我爱你
I love you.

288
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,480
我爱你
I love you.

289
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,200
你要换个游戏吗？
Do you want to change games?

290
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,160
我已经连赢两个月了
I'm on about a two-month winning streak.

291
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,270
我在循序渐进
I'm pacing myself.

292
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,370
我进宇航局是因为数学特别好
I got into NASA 'cause I was damn good at mathematics.

293
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,250
我不喜欢用“天才”这个词 不过…
Now, I don't like to use the word "prodigy," but--

294
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,870
是 我读过你的履历
Yeah, I read your bio.

295
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,730
你还曾把家里的狗绑在木火箭上 ?让它摔断了腿
You also broke the family dog's leg when you strapped it to a wooden rocket.

296
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,020
-这不重要   -对狗来说很重要
-That's irrelevant.   -Not to the dog.

297
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,750
你知道吗？拉米牌开局手牌
Did you know there are over 60 billion possible combinations

298
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,000
有六百亿种排列组合
of rummy hands at the start of the game?

299
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,040
所以你的连胜运势…
So this little streak you're on…

300
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,290
这个连胜运势 ?从宇宙一端延续到了另一端
A streak that's lasted from one side of the universe to the other.

301
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,580
只是在这六百亿种排列组合中
…is nothing more than a minuscule blip of luck

302
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,690
极微小的一种运气 但当你使用…
among 60 billion possible combinations. But when you apply…

303
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,310
天才级别的数学技巧进行对战
genius-level math skills to the equation,

304
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,310
你可以改变…
you can shift

305
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,730
那些排列组合 为己所用
those combinations to your favor.

306
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,600
你现在就是这么做的吗？
Hmm. And that is what you're doing now?

307
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,060
用数学压制我？
Overpowering me with math?

308
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,940
我的朋友 ?你就是我的数学家同行们所说的…
You, my friend, are what my fellow mathematicians refer to as…

309
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,000
傻瓜
a simpleton.

310
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,650
傻瓜
A simpleton!

311
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,290
-我们偏离航向了   -偏离了多远？
-We've deviated off course.   -How far?

312
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,620
还不清楚 在某个时刻自动关闭了
Can't tell yet. Auto-deactivated at some point.

313
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,230
关掉 在我们完全偏航前熄灭引擎
Shut us down. Kill the engines before we get completely sideways.

314
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,580
-导航有问题   -我们偏航了 偏航多远？
-Problem with navigation.   -So we're off course. How far?

315
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,750
不清楚
No idea.

316
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,900
好 那就搞清楚
Okay, we'll need to figure that out.

317
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,480
触发警报的偏差值是多少？
What is the variance for the alarm?

318
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,120
-零点四度   -响了多久？80秒？
-0.4 degrees.   -And it sounded for what? 80 seconds?

319
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,370
-时速四万八千公里   -加上引擎熄灭后的滑行速度
-At 30,000 miles per hour.   -Plus coast speed after engine kill.

320
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,870
导航和遥感勘测…
Guidance and telemetry are--

321
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,120
没有通讯所以不存在
Non-existent without comms.

322
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,100
桑彻斯 关掉警报
Sanchez, shut off the alarm.

323
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,910
萨利？你能听到什么？
Sully? What do you hear?

324
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,750
木星探测器 ?我们在K-23留下的信标
Jupiter probes, the beacon we left behind at K-23,

325
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,700
正在前往的补给探测器 ?一些废弃卫星…
the supply probe on its way there now, some dying satellites--

326
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,370
我们可以加以利用
We can use that.

327
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,620
我们可以把K-23信标 ?用作我们的起点
We can reference the K-23 beacon as our starting point.

328
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,700
它在我们身后
It's behind us.

329
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,660
我们还是可以规划 ?从那里出发前往卫星的航线
We can still build a course from there to the satellite.

330
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,270
开始规划
Start building.

331
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,080
萨利 给他准确的信标和脉冲数据
Sully, get him exact numbers on the beacon and pulse.

332
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,290
玛雅 帮桑彻斯设计航线
Maya, help Sanchez with the course design.

333
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,020
动作快 准备过程中我们一直在漂流
And move fast. We're drifting while we work.

334
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,310
真是麻烦不断
And the hits keep coming.

335
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,410
十个模型 十个匹配结果
Ten models, ten matching results.

336
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,440
这些数字你确定吗？
You sure about the numbers?

337
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,900
确定
Yes.

338
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:31,580
但这就让我们进入了未清障的区域
Yeah, but it puts us in zones that haven't been cleared for passage.

339
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,060
有什么已知风险吗？
Any risks you're aware of?

340
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,040
我们知道这里有流星活动
Well, we know there was meteor activity here,

341
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,150
我们可以避开 但是…
and we can avoid that, but…

342
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,020
这片区域…
this area…

343
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,020
我们没有测绘过
we haven't mapped.

344
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,020
没人测绘过
Nobody's mapped it.

345
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,770
有人有更好的方法带我们回家吗？
Anyone else have a better idea of how to get home?

346
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,190
好吧 那这就是我们的航线
Okay, then. That's our course.

347
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,230
好 但我不喜欢经过没有清障的区域
Okay, boss, but I sure don't like passing through zones that haven't been cleared.

348
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,730
我也不喜欢
I sure don't either.

349
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,690
我们现在没事了
We're okay for now.

350
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,980
不用一直看 这里的空气是安全的
No need to keep checking it. The air is safe here.

351
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,850
我们是安全的
We're safe.

352
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,940
对
Yeah.

353
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,020
我们要睡一会儿
We gotta get some sleep.

354
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,230
你需要睡觉
You need to sleep.

355
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,060
我需要睡觉
I need to sleep.

356
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,770
待在这儿
Stay here.

357
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,310
你得帮帮我 求你了
You… gotta help me, please.

358
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,730
什么？
What?

359
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,600
出去 快
Get out of here. Go!

360
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,100
好吧
Okay.

361
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,440
我们走
Let's go.

362
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,400
照顾好自己 再见
Take care of yourself  Goodbye!

363
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,480
来吧 我们上车 进去吧
Come on, then. Let's get you in the car. Come on. In you go.

364
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,900
好了 宝贝 系上安全带
Okay, sweetheart, buckle up.

365
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,060
我们当时在岛上
We were on the island.

366
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,940
我的…
My, uh…

367
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,770
我父亲得了中风 所以我们想陪陪他
My father had a stroke, so we wanted to spend time with him.

368
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,650
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

369
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,190
唉
Well,

370
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,770
人生就是这样
you know, life.

371
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,560
你跟她提过我吗？
Did you tell her about me?

372
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,440
如果你想让她认识你 ?你可以去自我介绍
If you want her to know about you, you can introduce yourself.

373
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,020
保重 奥古斯丁
Take care of yourself, Augustine.

374
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:49,540
这个机器的实际设计初衷
You know, this machine was actually designed

375
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,480
是探测可能入侵我们系统的 ?外星生命形态
to detect alien life-forms that might invade our system.

376
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,770
听起来很合理
That sounds about right.

377
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,400
你想知道是女孩还是男孩吗？
You wanna know if it's a girl or a boy?

378
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,560
绝对不要
Absolutely not.

379
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:00,310
我们要有女儿了
We're having a girl.

380
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,690
女儿？
A girl?

381
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,940
紧张吗？
Nervous?

382
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,560
你呢？
Are you?

383
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,150
这是我没想到的
I just didn't see this coming.

384
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,190
你也只是个普通人嘛
Well, you're only human.

385
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,410
你是说我控制不了自己吗？
Are you saying I couldn't help myself?

386
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:25,400
-不 这是你说的 不是我   -我说了吗？
-No, you said that, not me.   -Did I say that?

387
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,810
我也没想到
I didn't see it coming either.

388
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,730
那么…
So,

389
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,230
我们要给她取什么名字？
what are we gonna name her?

390
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,850
楚迪？
Trudy?

391
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,150
罗茜？
Roxy?

392
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,560
佩妮洛普？
Penelope?

393
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,190
玛格？
Margot?

394
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,900
麦齐？
Maggie?

395
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,730
汉丽埃塔？
Henrietta?

396
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,310
目前在这里…
This'll do.

397
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,520
就行了
For now.

398
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,310
那是你妈妈？
Is that your mom?

399
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,440
我曾认识一个长得很像她的人
I knew a face like that once.

400
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,350
是的 她的发色不太一样 但…
Yeah. Her hair was a little different shade, but…

401
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,350
她非常吵闹 不像你这么安静
She was as loud as you are quiet.

402
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:48,690
她笑的时候 所有人都会转头看她
When she'd laugh, everybody would turn and look.

403
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,950
我觉得她之所以这么爱笑
I think she'd laugh so much

404
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:57,560
是因为她知道自己比别人聪明太多
because she was that much smarter than everybody else, and she knew it.

405
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,850
我希望你能 ?跟我讲讲你的人生 艾莉丝
I wish you'd tell me something about your life, Iris.

406
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,060
讲什么都行
Anything would do.

407
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,520
嘿 艾莉丝
Hey, Iris.

408
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,350
问我一个问题
Ask me a question.

409
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,230
你爱过她吗？
Did you love her?

410
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,270
跑啊
Run!

411
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,650
我们不该停留的
We shouldn't have stopped.

412
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,310
我们只有这些了
It's all we have.

413
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,850
不 谢谢
No, thank you.

414
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,060
我更喜欢这些
I like these better.

415
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,650
等我们到了哈森湖
When we get to Lake Hazen,

416
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,520
那里的食物应有尽有
there's gonna be every kind of food there.

417
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,400
会有披萨…
There's gonna be pizza…

418
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,940
和芝士汉堡
and cheeseburgers.

419
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,020
想要什么都有
Anything you want.

420
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,350
没有豌豆
No peas.

421
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,560
我们继续往那个方向走
We keep going in that direction.

422
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,480
来
Come on.

423
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,350
没关系
It's all right.

424
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,310
我们会没事的
We're gonna be fine.

425
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,190
我们会没事的
We'll be fine.

426
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:10,440
我看到你了
I see you!

427
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,730
我看到你了
I see you!

428
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:40,350
艾莉丝？
Iris?

429
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,480
艾莉丝？我在这儿
Iris? I'm here!

430
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,810
顺着我的声音过来
Come to my voice!

431
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,480
我在这里
I'm here.

432
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,190
这里没有脚印
There's no tracks.

433
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,600
艾莉丝
Iris!

434
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:06,310
我在这儿
I'm here.

435
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,600
我在这儿
I'm here!

436
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:18,600
我在这儿
I'm here.

437
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,650
艾莉丝？
Iris?

438
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,690
我以为失去你了
I thought I'd lost you.

439
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,020
我以为失去你了
I thought I'd lost you.

440
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:35,350
你还真是了不起
Look what you did.

441
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,900
都还好吗？
All good?

442
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:49,190
就是按照桑彻斯告诉我的路线走
Just going where Sanchez tells me to go.

443
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,770
萨利有什么消息吗？
Anything from Sully?

444
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,810
还没有
Nothing yet.

445
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,190
这只是个小故障
It's just a glitch.

446
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:00,600
你真的这么认为吗？
You really believe that?

447
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,770
除非有人能告诉我不是 汤姆
Until someone tells me different, Tom.

448
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,310
我听说是个女孩
I understand it's a girl.

449
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,650
是的
Yeah.

450
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,400
海欣斯
Hyacinth.

451
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,440
什么？
What?

452
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,650
是我母亲的名字
It was my mother's name.

453
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,400
是某种花的意思
It's a flower.

454
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,440
海欣斯？
Hyacinth?

455
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,190
某种花
Some kind of flower.

456
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,810
北纬81-40
81-40 North.

457
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,520
西经72-58
72-58 West.

458
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,440
有人在吗？
Are you there?

459
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:21,450
这里是从木星任务返航的以太号飞船 ?能听到我说话吗？
This is the spaceship Aether returning from Jupiter Mission. Can you hear me?

460
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,770
可以
Yes.

461
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,650
是 我能收到
Yes. I'm receiving.

462
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:30,850
这里是哈森湖气象站
This is Lake Hazen Weather Station.

463
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:34,600
哈森湖 能听到你的声音 ?我简直太高兴了
Lake Hazen, I can't tell you how happy I am to hear your voice.

464
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,910
你是唯一愿意和我通话的人
For some reason, you're the only person who wants to talk to me.

465
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,410
我们和宇航局 ?以及其他人都失去了联系
We've lost contact with NASA and everyone else.

466
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,730
你知道有关 ?我们失去信号的任何信息吗？
Do you have information on our transmission blackout?

467
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,480
哈森湖 你还在吗？
Lake Hazen, are you there?

468
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:52,850
地球上的信息你知道了多少？
How much have you picked up about the conditions on Earth?

469
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,940
我们什么信息都没收到
We've received nothing.

470
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,150
我希望我…
I wish I--

471
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:02,600
对不起 哈森湖 上次通讯丢失了
I'm sorry, Lake Hazen, I missed that last transmission.

472
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,120
是控制中心吗？
Is that Mission Control?

473
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,370
哈森湖 你能收到吗？
Lake Hazen, are you receiving this?

474
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:16,850
我不了解全部细节 ?我知道那是个失误
I don't know all the details. I know it was a mistake.

475
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,650
开始是…
It started with--

476
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,060
还有…
…also--

477
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:32,350
哈森湖 你收到了吗？
Lake Hazen, do you copy?

478
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:42,020
-怎么回事？   -我在雷达上找不到
-What is it?   -I can't pull it up on radar.

479
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,330
-你可以在这个轴上转动吗？   -正在尝试
-Can you rotate on this axis?   -Trying now.

480
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,080
那是怎么回事？
What the hell is that?

481
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,560
在未知区域飞行就是会遇到这种事
It's what happens when you fly in the goddamn dark.

482
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:12,330
以太号？任务专员萨利文 ?你收到了吗？喂？
Aether? Mission Specialist Sullivan, do you copy? Hello?

483
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,400
哈森湖 能听到我的声音吗？
Lake Hazen, can you hear me?

484
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,400
哈森湖 能收到吗？
Lake Hazen, do you copy?

485
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,120
正在计算损毁情况

486
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:49,350
持续评估通讯系统以外的损毁
Stay on current to assess any damage beyond the comms.

487
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,400
结束了
It's over.

488
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,480
只是暂时的
For now.

489
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,100
萨利 主控室状态
Sully, bridge status.

490
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,950
已控制 有一面实验室墙壁受损
Contained. There's damage to a lab wall.

491
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:05,270
二级、三级通讯系统如何？
What's the status on secondary and tertiary communications?

492
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,310
失去联络…
Lost communications.

493
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:11,060
丢失雷达
And lost radar.

494
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,520
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

495
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,810
全面报告所有系统状态 ?我们至少要把雷达修好
Full reports on all systems, and let's at least get the radar fixed.

496
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,600
我来
On it.

497
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,270
看看我们情况如何
Let's see what we got.

498
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:34,100
那里是实验室墙壁
There's the lab wall.

499
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,440
3D打印机可以解决
The printer can fix that.

500
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,730
那是雷达
That's the radar.

501
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,520
好
Okay.

502
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:53,350
那里是通讯系统
And there's the comms.

503
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,830
正在计算损毁情况

504
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:56,690
那里是通讯系统
And there's the comms.

505
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:57,790
严重

506
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,400
可以重建
It can be rebuilt.

507
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,150
但需要外出行走
But it's gonna take a walk outside.

508
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,870
这是从哪找来的？
Where did you get this?

509
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:57,950
从登月舱平台支持那里偷来的
Stole it from the LM platform support.

510
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:01,950
等我们返航后 ?让宇航局去操心怎样卸下供给罐吧
NASA can worry about how to unload their supply canisters when we get back.

511
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,850
这样应该就可以了
That should do the trick.

512
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,600
嘿 玛雅？
Hey, Maya?

513
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:10,270
你觉得卡洛琳这个名字怎么样？
What do you think of the name Caroline?

514
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,730
还可以
It's okay.

515
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,690
比海欣斯要好？
Better than Hyacinth?

516
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,560
-是的   -对
-Yeah.   -Yup.

517
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,910
我们进展如何？
How are we doing?

518
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,660
截止时间之前应该能好
Should come in under the deadline.

519
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,850
应该让我和玛雅出去
I've been thinking. It's gotta be me and Maya going out.

520
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:31,650
好的 我可能也会一起 帮忙背那个
Okay, I'll probably tag along, help carry that thing.

521
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,410
外面没有重力
There's no gravity out there.

522
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,770
我们女孩儿也拿得动
It's not gonna be too heavy for us girls to handle.

523
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,400
我从不会错过出门散步的机会
I don't like to miss a chance to stroll around the block.

524
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,790
他去是因为担心你 ?还是因为我以前从没有外出行走过？
Is he going because he's worried about you or because I've never walked before?

525
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:52,500
你接受过训练
You've trained for this.

526
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,480
如果他不确定你能做到 ?就不会派你出去
He wouldn't send you out if he wasn't sure you could do it.

527
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,100
很好 只要我们中有一个有信心就行
Good. As long as one of us is.

528
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,450
她已经用了第四个了
That's her fourth.

529
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:18,350
她个子这么小 ?哪来这么多东西要吐？
I mean, she's so small. Where does it all keep coming from?

530
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:24,980
你感觉如何？
How you feeling?

531
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,520
我可以再吐一次
I could throw up again.

532
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:30,440
现在你知道我的感受了
Now you know how I feel.

533
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,900
在扣紧头盔前再吐一次
Do it now before you secure the helmet.

534
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,980
头盔非常难摘
It's a bitch to get off.

535
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,100
需要帮忙吗？
You need help?

536
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,850
谢谢
Thanks.

537
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,900
这是不对的
Now that's just wrong.

538
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:18,440
你还好吗 玛雅？
You good, Maya?

539
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:22,230
我们可以按你舒适的速度行进
We can go as fast or slow as you're comfortable out here.

540
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,730
对你也是一样 萨利
That goes for you too, Sully.

541
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:27,850
不着急 明白吗？
No rush, understood?

542
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,350
哦 我的天
Oh my God.

543
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,100
这景象无与伦比
No view quite like it.

544
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,270
-这是你的雷达   -是
-There's your radar.   -Yep.

545
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,480
安装位置应该要出现了
The installation site should be coming up.

546
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,230
我看到了
I see it.

547
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,480
25米
Twenty-five meters.

548
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,500
20米
Twenty meters.

549
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,600
看到天线位置了
Got eyes on the antenna site.

550
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:41,690
嘿 萨利 你觉得 ?佛罗伦斯这个名字怎么样？
Hey, Sully. What do you think of the name Florence?

551
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,900
孩子们会叫她“佛罗”
The kids would call her "Flo."

552
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,690
是 有道理
Yeah, good point.

553
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,600
雷达状况如何？
How's the radar look?

554
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:54,650
可能只是撞松了
Might just be knocked loose.

555
01:16:55,910 --> 01:17:01,060
有一些脱离的线路 但头部没有受损
We've got some detached wires, but the nose is intact.

556
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,650
什么？你说“头部”？
I'm sorry? Did you say "the nose"?

557
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,230
真爱吹毛求疵
Everybody's a critic.

558
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,650
-嘿 桑彻斯   -怎么了？
-Hey, Sanchez.   -Yep?

559
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,520
来点激励如何？
How about a little inspiration?

560
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,100
好 我觉得有首歌正适合你们
Yeah, I think I might have the song for you.

561
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:26,520
来吧 请欣赏 孩子们
Right here. Here you go. Enjoy, kids.

562
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:32,940
太棒了
Oh, yeah.

563
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,350
我没听过这首歌
I don't know this song.

564
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:08,850
没错 没听过
Nope, don't know it.

565
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:10,750
好了 米切尔 ?看看我们有没有收到雷达信号
Okay, Mitchell, let's see if we've got any radar.

566
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,270
收到
Copy that.

567
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,940
稍等
Give me a second.

568
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:17,150
好 很棒 正在重启
All right, fantastic. Rebooting now.

569
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,580
我入错行了
I am in the wrong profession.

570
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,850
这话我说了两年了
I've been saying that for two years.

571
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:27,520
玛雅 完成了吗？
Maya, are we secure?

572
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:30,120
是 让我完成最后一个连接
Yeah, just let me finish this last connection.

573
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,750
我们回去看看有谁想和我们通话
Let's get back and see who wants to talk to us.

574
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,270
-萨利 你带头   -好
-Sully, you take the lead.   -Okay.

575
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:43,500
好 各位 做得好 桑彻斯？
Okay, everybody, good job. Sanchez?

576
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:47,440
通讯系统不好说 不过雷达看起来…
Can't tell about comms, but radar looks like--

577
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,230
怎么了？
What do we got?

578
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,310
玛雅 快走
Maya, move!

579
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:08,080
艾迪 你得快点走 马上离开
Ade, you need to move fast. You need to go.

580
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,290
-离开那里   -马上 艾迪
-Get out of there.   -Go now, Ade!

581
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:13,940
-玛雅 马上离开   -我卡住了
-Maya! Get out of there now!   -I'm stuck!

582
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,150
玛雅 快走
Maya! Move!

583
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,060

I'm here, Ade!

585
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,440
好了
That's it.

586
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,600
结束了
It's over.

587
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:08,850
大家都还好吗？大家安全吗？
Is everybody all right? Everybody safe?

588
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,770
-你还好吗？   -混蛋 搞什么？
-You okay?   -Son of a bitch! What the fuck?

589
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,620
好了
Okay, okay.

590
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,950
我们在玛雅弄坏其他东西前进去吧
Let's get inside before Maya breaks something else.

591
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:20,400
我？
Me?

592
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,980
状态报告？
Status report?

593
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,650
雷达还在运转 然后…
Radar is still up, and…

594
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,750
通讯系统还在运转
comms is still up.

595
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:37,060
开始了 希望通讯系统一切顺利
Punching in now. Fingers crossed on comms.

596
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,270
我要喝一杯
Ugh, I need a drink.

597
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:47,100
我要庆祝第一次 ?也是最后一次太空行走
I am gonna celebrate the first and last time I walk in space.

598
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,950
不 我要喝两杯
No, no, I'm gonna have two drinks.

599
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:52,690
我们都要喝点
We could all use a drink.

600
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:55,600
谁说的？
Who said that?

601
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:58,020
萨利
Sully.

602
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,770
帮帮我
Help me.

603
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,790
帮帮我
Help-- Help me.

604
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:30,230
玛雅？
Maya?

605
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:35,060
玛雅？
Maya?

606
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:46,940
我在流血
I'm bleeding.

607
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,150
刺入伤
Penetration wound.

608
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:14,120
桑彻斯 带上医疗包来气闸见我们
Sanchez, have med-pack ready to meet us in the airlock.

609
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:18,190
桑彻斯在准备了 ?艾迪 她的氧气水平掉得很快
Sanchez is on it. Ade, her oxygen levels are falling fast.

610
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:18,830
玛雅

611
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,850
我们要把她固定住
Let's get her tied down.

612
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:34,020
-我做错什么了？   -你没有做错任何事
-What did I do wrong?   -You didn't do anything wrong.

613
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:39,190
好
Okay.

614
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,730
你会没事的 好吗？
You're gonna be fine.

615
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:49,600
很严重吗？
Is it bad?

616
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:52,230
我们把背包卸下来
Let's get this backpack off.

617
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:56,270
-呼吸 玛雅   -桑彻斯 把医疗包带进来
-Just breathe, Maya.   -Sanchez, get that med-pack in here!

618
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,520
快
Come on, come on.

619
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,600
呼吸
Just breathe.

620
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,980
对
That's it.

621
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,450
30秒
Thirty seconds!

622
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:19,700
我陪着你呢 看着我
I'm with you. Look at me. I'm with you.

623
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,870
-我来把你的头盔摘下来   -好
-I'm gonna take your helmet off.   -Okay.

624
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:23,870
-好吗？你会没事的   -好的
-Okay? You're gonna be fine.   -Okay.

625
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:25,850
20秒
Twenty seconds.

626
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:30,100
保持呼吸
Just breathe.

627
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:33,060
我们还有多长时间？就这样
How long have we got? That's it.

628
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,690
10秒 快
Ten seconds! Come on!

629
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,980
马上 快 可以通行
Now! Go! Clear!

630
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,270
-失血太多了   -没事的
-That's too much blood.   -It's okay.

631
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,700
-血太多了   -你没事的
-There's too much blood.   -You're okay.

632
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:20,370
-我们没时间了 加压   -这里？等等
-We don't have time. Put pressure.   -Here? Hang on.

633
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:21,900
你扶住她了吗？
You got her?

634
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,790
血太多了
There's too much blood. Too much blood.

635
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:29,290
-我可以的   -你会没事的 好吗？
-I got it.   -You're gonna be fine. Okay?

636
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,810
玛雅？呼吸
Maya? Maya, breathe.

637
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:37,230
-玛雅 拜托你呼吸 好吗？   -刺入伤直至背部下侧
-Maya, please breathe. Okay?   -Puncture wound to the lower back.

638
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:38,810
玛雅？
Maya?

639
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,190
玛雅？
Maya?

640
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,560
-玛雅？   -嗯
-Maya?   -Yes?

641
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,560
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine.

642
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:51,190
-你会没事的 是的   -不
-You're gonna be fine. Yes.   -No.

643
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,560
-玛雅   -血为什么止不住？
-Maya.   -Why won't the blood stop?

644
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:56,370
继续看着我
Keep looking at me.

645
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:58,410
-玛雅   -我要留在这里
-Maya.   -I have to stay here.

646
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:00,620
-好 等等   -米切尔 帮我们做好准备
-Okay, hold on.   -Mitchell, get us ready.

647
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:06,350
玛雅 继续看着我 呼吸
Maya. Keep looking at me. Maya. Maya. Breathe.

648
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:10,480
-拜托   -我在努力
-Please.   -I'm trying. I'm trying.

649
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:14,650
玛雅
Maya.

650
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:21,000
保持呼吸
Just breathe. Breathe.

651
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,230
玛雅
Maya. Maya.

652
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,230
哈森湖 这里是以太号 你能收到吗？
Lake Hazen, this is Aether. Are you receiving?

653
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:22,520
船长
Captain,

654
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,310
我们刚刚第一次看到地球
we just got our first view of Earth.

655
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:34,310
我连接到了 ?老阿斯特朗卫星望远镜的信号
I tied into the signals of the old Astron satellite telescope.

656
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:02,060
我们要怎么办？
What do we do?

657
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,060
哈森湖 这里是以太号 能收到吗？
Lake Hazen, this is Aether. Are you receiving?

658
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:15,290
重复…
I repeat,

659
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:19,770
哈森湖 这里是以太号 ?是否收到这次通讯？
Lake Hazen, this is Aether. Are you receiving this transmission?

660
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:24,900
哈森湖 收到了吗？
Lake Hazen, do you copy?

661
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,600
是 以太号
Yes, Aether.

662
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:31,020
我们的通讯系统之前掉线了
Our comm system went offline.

663
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:37,520
我们现在恢复运行 刚刚看到了地球
We're operational now and just got a visual on Earth.

664
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,540
很遗憾 我们在你们离开期间
I'm afraid we didn't do a good job

665
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,940
没有照顾好这里
of looking after the place while you were away.

666
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:55,150
你是否能看到任何新数据 ?为我们建议安全的进入点？
Do you see any new data that suggests possible safe entry points for us?

667
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,730
不能
No.

668
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,270
所有可生存区域都在地下
All survivable areas are underground.

669
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,060
而且那些也只是暂时的
And those are temporary.

670
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,980
我想提个建议
I'd like to suggest something.

671
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:25,480
你觉得合理吗？
Does this make sense to you?

672
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:32,000
如果是回K-23 我觉得合理
If we want to get back to K-23, yes.

673
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,150
这其实是个不错的计划
It's actually a pretty good plan.

674
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,560
我们脱离前往地球的路线
Deviate our approach to Earth,

675
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:41,500
然后利用重力在掉头时节省燃料
then make gravity our friend to save fuel on the turnaround.

676
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,700
我们为什么要这么做？
Why would we do that?

677
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:44,620
那里对我们来说什么都不剩了
There's nothing left for us down there.

678
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:46,540
我们不能利用重力助推回到宇宙中
We're not slingshotting back into space.

679
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:48,080
我们回去会死
We'll die if we go back.

680
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,040
他还活着
He's still alive.

681
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,870
两极是最后受影响的区域
Poles will be the last areas hit.

682
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:53,160
-他说大气污染在加重   -我们还不确定
-Air contamination is rising.   -We don't know anything.

683
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,790
我们看到它的状态了
We all saw what it looked like.

684
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:58,400
我们的任务是前往K-23 ?然后返航回家
Our mission was to go to K-23, turn around, and come home.

685
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,520
我们要回家
We're going home.

686
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:37,600
哈森湖 你还能收到吗？
Lake Hazen, are you still picking this up?

687
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:39,940
我在 以太号
I'm here, Aether.

688
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:45,190
哈森湖 我是以太号飞行指挥官 ?戈登艾迪沃利
Lake Hazen, this is Aether Flight Commander Gordon Adewole.

689
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,620
你的数字很有意思
Your numbers are intriguing,

690
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:51,830
但我很好奇你是怎么得出它们的
but they have me curious as to how you came up with them,

691
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:55,100
以及你为什么 ?这么了解我们的飞行计划
and how you know so much about our flight plan.

692
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:58,560
你到底是谁？
Who exactly are you?

693
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,020
奥古斯丁洛夫豪斯
Augustine Lofthouse.

694
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,150
洛夫豪斯博士
Dr. Lofthouse.

695
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,690
我本希望在返程后见到你
I had hoped to meet you upon our return.

696
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:21,850
不幸的是 从过去几天的情况来看 ?这越来越不可能了
Unfortunately, that seems less likely as of the last few days.

697
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:24,600
是的
Yes.

698
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:29,540
考虑到你的位置 你确认
Given your location, are you certain

699
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:33,440
南半球没有安全的区域吗？
there are no safe regions in the southern hemisphere?

700
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,810
南极洲？
Antarctica?

701
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:39,940
不 没有了
No, there's nowhere.

702
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:53,060
对不起
I'm sorry.

703
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:59,940
我们会再讨论可行的方案 ?希望还能再次通话
We'll discuss our options up here and hopefully, speak again.

704
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,190
有一条给你的留言
There is a message for you.

705
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,150
正在下载
It's downloading.

706
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:27,440
什么时候发的？
When was it sent?

707
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,190
十天前
Ten days ago.

708
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,020
亲爱的
My love, I…

709
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:38,370
我不知道你是否了解下面的情况
Um, I don't know if you know what's going on down here,

710
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:42,690
但我们被要求撤离
but, um, we're being asked to evacuate.

711
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,400
儿子们病了
the boys are sick.

712
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,600
我希望你能知道我们要去哪
I want you to know where we're going,

713
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,940
因为以后我再也不能联络你了
because I won't be able to contact you anymore.

714
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,310
我爱你
I love you…

715
01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:04,940
很爱
so much.

716
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,020
很爱
so much.

717
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,480
船长 你有时间吗？
Captain, you got a minute?

718
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,600
当然
Of course.

719
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:53,980
我一想到干这行干了多久 ?就觉得很有意思
It's funny when I think about how long I've been doing this.

720
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,980
20年前 我和凯西
You know, 20 years ago, Kath and I,

721
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,440
我们讨论过风险
we used to talk about the risks.

722
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:08,650
这里面有一定的危险因素
A certain amount of danger is involved, and…

723
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,770
我们把它考虑在内
we took that into account.

724
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:17,100
我才应该是那个面临风险的人
I was the one that was supposed to be at risk.

725
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,100
而他们应该是安全的
And they were supposed to be safe.

726
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,560
留在家里…
Home…

727
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:31,650
保证安全
and safe.

728
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,310
这艘船上有两个返回舱 ?我想用其中一个
You have two reentry pods on this ship, and I'd like to take one of them.

729
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,440
你是对的
And you were right.

730
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,650
你的职责是掉转航向 开始新生活
It's your job to turn the ship around, start a new life.

731
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:48,270
这次好好把握
Do better this time.

732
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:51,940
但我的职责…
But it's my job…

733
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:56,480
是遵守和家人的约定
to keep a promise that I made to my family.

734
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,770
我明白
I understand.

735
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,940
我也会这么做
I'd feel the same way.

736
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:06,810
我知道你会
I know you would.

737
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:47,650
驾驶需要两个人
It takes two to fly that.

738
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:49,190
我自己可以的
I'll manage.

739
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:55,230
我要和你一起
I'm going to go with you.

740
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:04,850
你为什么要这样做？
Why would you wanna do that?

741
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:07,250
我一直在思考
I've been thinking.

742
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:09,230
这是你犯的第一个错误
That's your first mistake.

743
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:15,900
关于时间我想了很多
Been thinking a lot about time…

744
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:21,150
以及它的利用方式和原因
and how it gets used and why.

745
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,600
为什么有的人可以安度一生…
Why one person lives a lifetime

746
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:28,850
有的人只能活几年
and another only gets a few years.

747
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:37,690
我女儿玛利亚 四岁时去世了
My daughter, Maria, she died when she was four.

748
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:41,940
她活着的话 应该和玛雅一样大
She would have been the same age as Maya.

749
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:47,850
有些夜晚 我睡不着时
Sometimes at night, when I couldn't sleep,

750
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:51,270
我会想象她们是朋友
I would pretend that they were friends.

751
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:56,020
一起聊学校的事 或者聊男孩子
They'd talk about school together. Or boys.

752
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,020
我想带玛雅回家
I want to take Maya home.

753
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:15,600
感觉这是我利用时间的最佳方式
It seems like the best use of my time.

754
01:40:24,370 --> 01:40:28,480
所以我想 如果可以的话 ?和自己的伙伴一起搭车回家
So I was thinking I'll take a ride home with my buddy, if that's okay.

755
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,480
好
Okay.

756
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:13,230
再见 萨利
Bye, Sully.

757
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,940
照顾好自己 好吗？ ?还有我们的小卡洛琳
Take care of yourself, okay? And our little Caroline.

758
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:39,940
希望你能找到你的家人
I hope you find your family.

759
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,980
祝我们好运
Wish us luck.

760
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,480
祝你们好运
Good luck.

761
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:32,400
这里是以太号 能收到吗？
This is Aether. Are you receiving?

762
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:37,730
洛夫豪斯博士 能听见我说话吗？
Dr. Lofthouse, can you hear me?

763
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:39,650
我能听见
I hear you.

764
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:47,270
我们进入了电离层黑障区 ?所以很快会和你失去联系
We're headed into an ionization blackout, so I'm gonna lose you soon.

765
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:52,100
但我想先联系你 对你表示感谢
But I wanted to contact you first to thank you.

766
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:56,100
艾迪沃利指挥官和我现在调转方向了
Commander Adewole and I are turning back.

767
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,650
很好
That's good.

768
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:08,900
米切尔船长和桑彻斯专员决定返回
Captain Mitchell and Specialist Sanchez decided on reentry.

769
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:13,940
他们有家人在这里？
They have family down here?

770
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,230
是的
Yes.

771
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,900
我理解
I understand.

772
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:30,450
飞行工程师玛雅劳伦斯
Flight Engineer Maya Lawrence,

773
01:44:30,450 --> 01:44:33,850
在飞行中遭遇事故
she suffered an accident during the flight.

774
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,600
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

775
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:49,270
你做的一切…
What you did…

776
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:53,600
你发现了宇宙中的很多奥秘
You discovered so much up here.

777
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,850
我只是指路
I just point.

778
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,810
你指向了一个很棒的世界
Well, you pointed to an incredible world.

779
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:11,600
我真希望你也能看到
I wish you could have seen it.

780
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:20,440
我只能看哈森湖了
Lake Hazen will have to do.

781
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:26,020
你怎么会跑到那儿去？
How did you end up there?

782
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:33,730
我想着也许可以帮助别人
I thought maybe I could help someone.

783
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:37,440
你真的帮到了
Well, you've definitely done that.

784
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:42,690
你是我加入太空计划的原因之一
You know, you're one of the reasons I joined the space program.

785
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:48,310
你和我母亲共事过 珍萨利文
You had done some work with my mother, Jean Sullivan.

786
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,560
她曾带回家一块你送给她的月岩
She brought home a moon rock you gave her.

787
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:55,160
我觉得那是最棒的东西
I thought it was the most amazing thing ever.

788
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:58,230
它让我想到月亮上找到更多月岩
It made me want to go up and find more.

789
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,520
我希望能当面谢谢你 洛夫豪斯博士
I wish I could have thanked you for it in person, Dr. Lofthouse.

790
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,600
叫我奥古斯丁
Augustine.

791
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:11,650
奥古斯丁
Augustine.

792
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,600
我叫艾莉丝
And I'm Iris.

793
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:21,100
我知道
I know.

794
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:44,900
终于能认识你真好
It's very nice to finally meet you.

795
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:54,190
那里怎么样 艾莉丝？
What's it like there, Iris?

796
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:56,650
跟我说说
Tell me about it.

797
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,600
很棒
It's amazing.

798
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:05,940
殖民站感觉像科罗拉多
The colony site, it feels like Colorado.

799
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:08,730
你去过吗？
Have you ever been there,

800
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:11,520
那里的山区？
to the mountains?

801
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,350
去过
Yes.

802
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,900
空气很新鲜
The air is so crisp, and…

803
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:24,040
那个星球有一种味道
and the planet has that smell.

804
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:27,660
像是地下藏着松树
It's like pine trees are hidden somewhere underground,

805
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:29,560
等待破土而出
waiting to burst through.

806
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:35,410
我们刚到的最初几周
First weeks we were there,

807
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:38,330
我一直抬头看 期待能看到蓝天
I kept looking up, expecting to see a blue sky,

808
01:47:38,330 --> 01:47:40,190
但它却是橘黄色的
but it was orange

809
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,900
那是来自木星反射的光线
from the light reflecting off Jupiter.

810
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:48,440
运行到合适的位置时
When the orbit is just right,

811
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,190
木星感觉很近
Jupiter feels so close that…

812
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:56,850
让人觉得触手可及
you're sure you could almost touch it.

813
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,940
那光线让所有色彩都更加鲜明 ?一切事物的色彩
And that light, it makes all the colors explode, everything.

814
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,310
水
Water…

815
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,650
花…
flowers…

816
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:14,060
就像《绿野仙踪》中刚进入奥兹王国 ?第一次看到真正的色彩一样
It's like landing in Oz and seeing real color for the first time.

817
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:22,020
我从没见过这么美的东西
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

818
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:32,350
洛夫豪斯博士？
Dr. Lofthouse?

819
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,650
奥古斯丁？
Augustine?

820
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:43,770
好像和他失去联络了
Think I lost him.

821
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,100
看来就剩我们了
I guess it's just us now.

822
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,520
就剩我们？
Just us?
