1
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,541
Still time to change your mind.

2
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,916
Like a race to see who'd die first.

3
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,916
<i>Terminal patient</i>
<i>outlives the rest of humanity.</i>

4
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,958
<i>Someone should</i>
<i>put you in a medical journal.</i>

5
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>Nobody around to read it.</i>

6
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,125
<i>If you stop the transfusions,</i>
<i>you won't last a week.</i>

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,166
<i>If I was in a hurry to die,</i>
<i>I'd go with you.</i>

8
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,500
<i>- We all want to be home.</i>
<i>- Where is that?</i>

9
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,041
<i>Well, for you, I guess that's here.</i>

10
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,541
<i>As good a place as any.</i>

11
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,083
Ana? Ana!

12
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,833
<i>- Leave everything behind.</i>
<i>- Ana! Ana?</i>

13
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,041
<i>- Leave all belongings behind.</i>
<i>- Ana!</i>

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,541
<i>-My little girl is missing!</i>
<i>-What?</i>

15
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,625
<i>-I can't find my daughter. She isn't here.</i>
<i>-What's the problem?</i>

16
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,958
<i>I can't find her!</i>

17
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>- Katherine!</i>
<i>- Ana?</i>

18
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,541
<i>- She already left.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

19
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,833
<i>They put her on another helicopter.</i>
<i>I saw her.</i>

20
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,791
<i>- What? She was alone?</i>
<i>- No, with Doctor Rogg.</i>

21
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,500
<i>He said to tell you</i>
<i>he will meet you on the ground.</i>

22
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,125
<i>- We have to go.</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

23
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,916
Are you checking off names?

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,958
<i>Nobody gave me a list.</i>
<i>I just put people on the chopper.</i>

25
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,833
<i>What about him?</i>

26
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,375
<i>He's staying.</i>

27
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,583
<i>Let's go!</i>

In our galaxy alone,
there are billions of stars,

38
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,291
<i>each one a sun to its own solar system.</i>

39
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,625
<i>And most of those suns have planets,</i>

40
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,708
{\an8}<i>so it stands to reason that</i>

41
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,875
{\an8}<i>of these hundreds of billions</i>
<i>of exoplanets that exist in our galaxy,</i>

42
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,458
{\an8}<i>at least one of them</i>
<i>has the potential to support life.</i>

43
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,291
<i>This is K-23,</i>
<i>Jupiter's previously undiscovered moon.</i>

44
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,250
<i>Not quite an exoplanet.</i>

45
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,625
<i>The moon's atmosphere</i>
<i>is governed not by the sun,</i>

46
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,541
<i>but by its thermal volcanic activity.</i>

47
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,291
<i>In simpler terms,</i>
<i>when studying K-23's lunar spectrum,</i>

48
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,416
<i>its biomarkers and water vapors,</i>

49
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,250
{\an8}<i>it appears as though</i>
<i>it's being heated from the inside out.</i>

50
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,750
<i>While further probing will need to test</i>
<i>for atmospheric habitability,</i>

51
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,750
<i>we can confidently say</i>

52
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,000
{\an8}<i>that based on its mass,</i>
<i>radial velocity, and orbit,</i>

53
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,666
{\an8}<i>it could be just right.</i>

54
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,875
<i>I haven't met him personally,</i>

55
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,500
{\an8}<i>but I gathered research for his partner</i>
<i>years ago, read his papers.</i>

56
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,000
{\an8}<i>Was that at Oxford?</i>

57
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,500
<i>No, Michigan.</i>

58
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,583
<i>Michigan.</i>

59
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,583
<i>Very cold.</i>

60
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,416
{\an8}<i>-Yeah. Have you been?</i>

61
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,291
<i>What are you drinking?</i>

62
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,166
<i>Whiskey. What are you drinking?</i>

63
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,083
<i>Same as you.</i>

64
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,000
{\an8}<i>There's a place called Portobello Beach.</i>

65
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,416
{\an8}<i>-Have you heard of this?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

66
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,583
{\an8}<i>It's so beautiful. You should go there.</i>
<i>Just off the coast near Edinburgh.</i>

67
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,166
<i>In the height of summer,</i>
<i>it's probably gonna be raining.</i>

68
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,000
<i>-It's a tourist trap.</i>
<i>-Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

69
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,291
<i>You should go to the beach.</i>

70
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,791
<i>-It's beautiful.</i>
<i>-I will.</i>

71
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:15,291
{\an8}<i>But, um, while I have you,</i>
<i>can I ask you a very serious question</i>

72
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,833
{\an8}<i>about your very serious book?</i>

73
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,541
<i>How much of</i>
<i>what you're searching for is reality,</i>

74
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,666
<i>and how much of your planet is just</i>

75
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,875
<i>bullshit?</i>

76
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,500
<i>List active missions.</i>

77
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,625
Neowise, inactive.

78
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,333
<i>Voyager 3, inactive.</i>

79
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,041
<i>International Space Station, evacuated.</i>

80
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,000
<i>Orion 2, inactive.</i>

81
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,125
<i>Aether, active.</i>

82
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,666
<i>Geofen 3, inactive.</i>

83
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,333
<i>-Jason 4--</i>
-Show me Aether.

84
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,791
<i>How long till Aether's</i>
<i>in range for direct contact?</i>

85
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,958
Aether will be
in range in 11 hours and 54 minutes.

86
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,291
<i>- Set an alarm for notification.</i>
<i>- </i>Alarm is set.

87
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,416
<i>On my way.</i>

88
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,583
<i>No! Wait!</i>

89
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,958
<i>Ade!</i>

90
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,333
<i>Wait! I'm here!</i>

91
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,458
<i>You awake, Maya?</i>

92
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>I'm awake. How are you feeling?</i>

93
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,750
<i>Like a moose.</i>

94
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,291
<i>- Morning, Sully.</i>
<i>- I'm not speaking to you.</i>

95
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,500
<i>Why is that?</i>

96
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,000
<i>I had a dream you left me</i>
<i>on K-23, so I'm not talking to you.</i>

97
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,750
<i>- You started early.</i>
<i>- Champions never rest.</i>

98
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,166
<i>You still trying to beat your boys' times?</i>

99
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,458
<i>-They pay you to distract me, don't they?</i>
<i>-Nah, I do it for free.</i>

100
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,916
<i>- You hear anything from home?</i>
<i>- I'm trying.</i>

101
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,958
<i>-Good morning, Sanchez.</i>
<i>-Morning, Sully.</i>

102
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,791
<i>Your decaf.</i>

103
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,916
<i>Whoa! Thank you, thank you.</i>

104
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,041
<i>- Anything yet?</i>
<i>- Nothing yet.</i>

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,500
<i>This is Aether Mission K-23,</i>
<i>open on all channels.</i>

106
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,958
<i>Does anyone copy?</i>

107
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,625
<i>Repeat.</i>

108
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,083
<i>Does anyone copy?</i>

109
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,541
<i>- What's she hearing?</i>
<i>- What frequency is this?</i>

110
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,541
<i>I'm running S, X, and Ka.</i>

111
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,875
<i>- That puts our last contact--</i>
<i>- Including the control blackout?</i>

112
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,291
<i>- Post-blackout.</i>
<i>- Three weeks.</i>

113
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,666
<i>If Mojave goes offline, then Spain</i>
<i>or Australia immediately grabs the signal.</i>

114
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,791
<i>No gaps. We're not receiving anything.</i>

115
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,666
<i>I've taken everything apart, rebooted</i>
<i>it a dozen times, and nothing works.</i>

116
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,458
<i>I also couldn't make contact</i>
<i>with the K-23 colony flight,</i>

117
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>which should've been</i>
<i>in the air a week ago.</i>

118
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,916
<i>I mean, it could be atmospheric,</i>

119
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,041
<i>RF pollution,</i>
<i>or maybe a geomagnetic storm.</i>

120
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:31,250
<i>But none of that could last this long</i>
<i>or disrupt both hemispheres.</i>

121
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,208
<i>No.</i>

122
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:53,083
<i>Hello, this is Barbeau Observatory.</i>
<i>A family member has been left behind.</i>

123
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,125
<i>Somebody needs to come back for her.</i>

124
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:05,416
<i>Hello, this is Barbeau Observatory.</i>
<i>An outpost child has been left. Sh--</i>

125
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,541
<i>What's your name?</i>

126
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,333
<i>Your name-- What's your name?</i>

127
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,500
<i>She's a--</i>
<i>She's an unidentified child.</i>

128
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,416
<i>She's seven or eight. She's alone.</i>

129
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,833
<i>Somebody has to come back. Sh--</i>

130
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,166
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

131
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,541
<i>Hey.</i>

132
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,958
<i>Somebody's gotta be coming back for you,</i>

133
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,083
<i>because I can't help you.</i>

134
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,833
<i>You understand?</i>

135
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,708
<i>I'm the wrong person.</i>

136
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,375
<i>I'm the wrong person.</i>

137
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,375
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

138
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,833
<i>You have any brothers or sisters?</i>

139
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,916
<i>You're not deaf, right?</i>
<i>You can hear me talking?</i>

140
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,125
<i>Hey.</i>

141
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,208
<i>Well, that's clear.</i>

142
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,375
<i>You just can't talk?</i>

143
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,625
<i>Or you won't?</i>

144
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,333
<i>You just want to piss me off.</i>

145
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,125
<i>What is that? Is that an iris?</i>

146
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,375
<i>Is it--</i>

147
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:14,958
<i>Iris?</i>

148
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,708
<i>Okay.</i>

149
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,416
Aether is within direct contact range.

150
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
<i>There are no incoming messages.</i>

151
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,791
<i>Come in, Aether.</i>
<i>This is Barbeau Observatory.</i>

152
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,166
<i>Are you receiving this?</i>

153
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,875
<i>Come in, Aether.</i>
<i>This is Barbeau Observatory.</i>

154
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,375
<i>Are you receiving this?</i>

155
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,666
<i>Don't-- Don't touch anything.</i>

156
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,250
<i>Come in, Aether.</i>
<i>This is Barbeau Observatory.</i>

157
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,708
<i>Are you receiving this?</i>

158
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
<i>No touching.</i>

159
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,916
<i>Come in, Aether.</i>

160
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,291
<i>This is Barbeau Observatory.</i>
<i>Are you receiving this?</i>

161
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,625
<i>That's Aether.</i>

162
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,916
<i>It's a spaceship, far away,</i>

163
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,500
<i>coming back from a planet that we--</i>

164
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,500
<i>we hoped would be our future, but…</i>

165
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,666
<i>Things didn't quite turn out that way.</i>

166
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,250
<i>That's why I have to contact them.</i>

167
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,833
<i>Now, before it's too late.</i>

168
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,833
<i>You understand?</i>

169
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,083
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

170
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,333
<i>This is my room.</i>

171
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,125
<i>This is my room.</i>

172
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,416
<i>Here.</i>

173
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,583
<i>You sleep in here.</i>

174
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,291
<i>No.</i>

175
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,166
<i>Okay.</i>

176
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,708
<i>The antenna's our problem.</i>
<i>It's not strong enough.</i>

177
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,125
<i>Doesn't matter</i>
<i>what direction we put it in.</i>

178
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,916
<i>They're not answering us</i>
<i>because they can't hear us.</i>

179
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,916
<i>Well, that's something.</i>

180
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:59,250
<i>Given all the variables,</i>
<i>the fact that we can't contact</i>

181
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,041
<i>the K-23 colony flight</i>

182
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,541
<i>and can't raise Mojave on any frequency,</i>

183
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,958
<i>our obvious conclusion must be…</i>

184
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,750
<i>that the fault lies with us.</i>

185
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:17,583
<i>But we have exhausted</i>
<i>every possible trouble area on our side</i>

186
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,583
<i>and simply cannot find it.</i>

187
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,166
If this were
a less experienced crew,

188
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,250
<i>this ship would be in full-blown panic.</i>

189
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,833
Slow down.

190
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:32,041
Mission Specialist Sullivan
is now breaking every protocol

191
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,833
<i>as she attempts</i>
<i>to make any kind of contact,</i>

192
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:37,708
<i>including China, India…</i>

193
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:40,875
<i>and Russia.</i>

194
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,000
<i>This action is under my direction.</i>

195
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,208
<i>Mitchell is…</i>

196
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,125
<i>simply the best flier there is,</i>

197
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,833
<i>but he's anxious to get home.</i>

198
00:27:55,208 --> 00:28:01,166
<i>Maya and Sanchez are on 12-hour shifts</i>
<i>as they boot and reboot the comms system,</i>

199
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,250
<i>again at my order.</i>

200
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:09,125
<i>Overall, the crew's spirit remains high</i>
<i>as we near the end of our journey.</i>

201
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,500
<i>Our two-year mission to K-23</i>

202
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,666
<i>has us returning</i>
<i>with more answers than questions.</i>

203
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,916
<i>Can it sustain life? Yes.</i>
<i>Can it expand? Yes.</i>

204
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,875
<i>Could it be home?</i>

205
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,250
<i>Yes, it could.</i>

206
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,208
<i>Every question</i>
<i>we set out to answer, we did…</i>

207
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,375
<i>except the one that lingers in the air.</i>

208
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,166
<i>"Why is it so quiet?"</i>

209
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,208
Your breakfast
has timed out. Would you like another?

210
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,583
<i>No. Almost done.</i>

211
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,458
<i>I know.</i>

212
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,458
<i>Doesn't make much sense to me either.</i>

213
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,500
<i>You know, there's no rule that says</i>
<i>you have to touch everything.</i>

214
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,333
<i>Polaris.</i>

215
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>You see it?</i>

216
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,916
<i>It's the most important star in the sky.</i>

217
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,291
<i>If you ever get lost,</i>
<i>it'll help you find your way.</i>

218
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,750
<i>I called you. You didn't answer.</i>

219
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,791
<i>Sorry, I was working.</i>

220
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,166
<i>Can't answer your phone</i>
<i>when you're working?</i>

221
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,791
<i>I can. I just didn't.</i>

222
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,375
<i>I called to tell you I'm not pregnant.</i>

223
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,583
<i>You're safe.</i>

224
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:36,791
<i>It was just a…</i>

225
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,416
<i>possible sighting of a life-form</i>
<i>that ultimately proved false.</i>

226
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,750
<i>You want to be an explorer, Augustine.</i>

227
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,708
<i>To discover new worlds,</i>
<i>to… give life some hope.</i>

228
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,958
<i>But while you're doing all that,</i>
<i>your own life is just</i>

229
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,416
<i>slipping away.</i>

230
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:09,666
<i>And that breaks my heart.</i>

231
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,333
<i>But, you know…</i>

232
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,666
<i>I'm sure it's for the best.</i>

233
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,708
<i>It shouldn't be up this far.</i>

234
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,083
<i>Not yet.</i>

235
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:55,000
<i>There is an antenna</i>
<i>that's stronger than ours.</i>

236
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,708
<i>It's up north.</i>

237
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,458
<i>There.</i>

238
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,500
<i>Lake Hazen.</i>

239
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,750
<i>It's a weather station.</i>

240
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,625
<i>It's protected by this mountain range.</i>

241
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,375
<i>So the air might still be good.</i>

242
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:21,833
<i>At least for a while.</i>

243
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,583
<i>We get to that antenna,</i>
<i>somebody'll hear us.</i>

244
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,083
<i>It's a long way.</i>

245
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,666
<i>It's okay.</i>

246
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,166
<i>It's all right. You have to.</i>

247
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:46,416
<i>So do I.</i>

248
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:49,166
<i>Just take a deep breath.</i>

249
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,875
<i>That's not so bad, right?</i>

250
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,375
<i>Okay.</i>

251
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:08,250
<i>Never take it off, no matter what.</i>

252
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,875
- Right?
- And I hear this, like…

253
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,416
<i>- Sniffing.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

254
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,875
Then I heard this voice
that was like, "Damn, you smell good."

255
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,750
<i>- </i>What?
<i>- </i> And it was the guy!

256
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,125
<i>- </i>No way, you're lying.
<i>- </i>Why would I lie?

257
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,250
<i>- </i>He did that?
<i>- </i>No, he didn't.

258
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,291
<i>- </i>My God. He did that?
<i>- </i>Yeah, he did.

259
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,708
<i>- </i>But why?
<i>- </i>'Cause I smell good!

260
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,291
So, what? He was behind you?

261
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:20,125
He was right behind me.
He came down onto my neck.

262
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,958
<i>It's okay. You can come in.</i>

263
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,916
<i>No.</i>

264
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,916
<i>Come in!</i>

265
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,916
Is he hot?

266
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,958
<i>Okay.</i>

267
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,875
- If you're late, you're not hot.
-  Yeah, but… Okay.

268
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,833
So you don't mind if someone's--

269
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,791
No, I wanted
to know if he was hot.

270
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,000
<i>So, this is my sister.</i>

271
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:41,250
<i>And that is my very,</i>
<i>very best friend from high school.</i>

272
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,041
<i>- </i> So he turns up.
<i>.</i>

273
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,125
He turns up.
<i>- Wait for it.</i>

274
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,416
<i>Here it comes.</i>

275
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:54,041
<i>The world's smartest cat, Einstein.</i>

276
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:58,416
- Hey, baby!
- Hey, honeybun.

277
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,083
<i>He still likes me best.</i>

278
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,500
I need to hear what happened.

279
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:07,375
<i>- </i>I don't know.
<i>- </i>I told you, the guy with…

280
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,625
<i>Is it the sniffer?</i>

281
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,916
<i>No! What?</i>

282
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,375
I'm so frightened.

283
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:19,583
I'm so sorry for so many things.

284
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,500
<i>I love you, Margaret.</i>

285
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,250
<i>I love you.</i>

286
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,083
<i>I love you.</i>

287
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,458
Do you want to change games?

288
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,875
<i>- I'm on about a two-month winning streak.</i>
<i>- I'm pacing myself.</i>

289
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:45,291
<i>I got into NASA</i>
<i>'cause I was damn good at mathematics.</i>

290
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:48,166
<i>Now, I don't like to</i>
<i>use the word "prodigy," but--</i>

291
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,000
<i>Yeah, I read your bio.</i>

292
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:53,333
<i>You also broke the family dog's leg</i>
<i>when you strapped it to a wooden rocket.</i>

293
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,625
<i>-That's irrelevant.</i>
<i>-Not to the dog.</i>

294
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,583
<i>Did you know there are</i>
<i>over 60 billion possible combinations</i>

295
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,666
<i>of rummy hands at the start of the game?</i>

296
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,958
<i>So this little streak you're on…</i>

297
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:12,208
<i>A streak that's lasted from</i>
<i>one side of the universe to the other.</i>

298
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,166
<i>…is nothing more than</i>
<i>a minuscule blip of luck</i>

299
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,166
<i>among 60 billion possible combinations.</i>

300
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,500
<i>But when you apply…</i>

301
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,916
<i>genius-level math skills to the equation,</i>

302
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,916
<i>you can shift</i>

303
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,333
<i>those combinations to your favor.</i>

304
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,208
<i>And that is what you're doing now?</i>

305
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,666
<i>Overpowering me with math?</i>

306
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,583
<i>You, my friend,</i>

307
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:42,250
<i>are what my fellow mathematicians</i>
<i>refer to as… a simpleton.</i>

308
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,500
<i>! A simpleton!</i>

309
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:57,375
<i>- We've deviated off course.</i>
<i>- How far?</i>

310
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,541
<i>Can't tell yet.</i>
<i>Auto-deactivated at some point.</i>

311
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:03,125
Shut us down. Kill the engines
before we get completely sideways.

312
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,625
<i>-Problem with navigation.</i>
<i>-So we're off course. How far?</i>

313
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,666
<i>No idea.</i>

314
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,750
<i>Okay, we'll need to figure that out.</i>

315
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,666
<i>What is the variance for the alarm?</i>

316
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,041
<i>- 04 degrees.</i>
<i>- And it sounded for what? 80 seconds?</i>

317
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:24,291
<i>- </i>At 30,000 miles per hour.
<i>- Plus coast speed after engine kill.</i>

318
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,791
<i>Guidance and telemetry are--</i>

319
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,833
<i>-Non-existent without comms.</i>
<i>-Sanchez, shut off the alarm.</i>

320
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,833
<i>Sully? What do you hear?</i>

321
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:49,666
Jupiter probes,
the beacon we left behind at K-23,

322
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,625
<i>the supply probe on its way</i>
<i>there now, some dying satellites--</i>

323
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,291
<i>We can use that.</i>

324
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:58,958
<i>We can reference</i>
<i>the K-23 beacon as our starting point.</i>

325
00:40:59,041 --> 00:40:59,916
<i>It's behind us.</i>

326
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,291
<i>We can still build a course</i>
<i>from there to the satellite.</i>

327
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,208
<i>Start building.</i>

328
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,000
<i>Sully, get him exact numbers</i>
<i>on the beacon and pulse.</i>

329
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,208
Maya,
help Sanchez with the course design.

330
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,625
<i>And move fast.</i>
<i>We're drifting while we work.</i>

331
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,333
<i>And the hits keep coming.</i>

332
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:19,333
<i>Ten models, ten matching results.</i>

333
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,041
You sure about the numbers?

334
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:25,708
<i>Yes.</i>

335
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:31,500
<i>Yeah, but it puts us in zones</i>
<i>that haven't been cleared for passage.</i>

336
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,666
<i>Any risks you're aware of?</i>

337
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,958
<i>Well, we know</i>
<i>there was meteor activity here,</i>

338
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,750
<i>and we can avoid that, but…</i>

339
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,625
<i>this area…</i>

340
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:47,625
<i>we haven't mapped.</i>

341
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:49,625
<i>Nobody's mapped it.</i>

342
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:54,458
<i>Anyone else have</i>
<i>a better idea of how to get home?</i>

343
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,791
<i>Okay, then. That's our course.</i>

344
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:05,208
<i>Okay, boss, but I sure don't like passing</i>
<i>through zones that haven't been cleared.</i>

345
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,333
<i>I sure don't either.</i>

346
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,666
<i>We're okay for now.</i>

347
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:37,583
<i>No need to keep checking it.</i>
<i>The air is safe here.</i>

348
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:41,458
<i>We're safe.</i>

349
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:46,375
<i>Yeah.</i>

350
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,041
<i>We gotta get some sleep.</i>

351
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:54,833
<i>You need to sleep.</i>

352
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,666
<i>I need to sleep.</i>

353
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,375
<i>Stay here.</i>

354
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:03,916
<i>You… gotta help me, please.</i>

355
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,333
<i>What?</i>

356
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,166
<i>Please…</i>

357
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:18,208
<i>Get out of here. Go!</i>

358
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:32,791
<i>Okay.</i>

359
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,208
<i>Let's go.</i>

360
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:05,416
<i>Take care of yourself</i>
<i>Goodbye!</i>

361
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,500
<i>Come on, then.</i>
<i>Let's get you in the car. Come on.</i>

362
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:10,583
<i>In you go.</i>

363
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,083
<i>Okay, sweetheart, buckle up.</i>

364
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,666
<i>We were on the island.</i>

365
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:36,666
<i>My, …</i>

366
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,208
<i>My father had a stroke,</i>
<i>so we wanted to spend time with him.</i>

367
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:42,250
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

368
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:46,375
<i>Well, you know, life.</i>

369
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,833
<i>Did you tell her about me?</i>

370
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:06,041
<i>If you want her to know about you,</i>
<i>you can introduce yourself.</i>

371
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:17,625
<i>Take care of yourself, Augustine.</i>

372
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:49,458
<i>You know,</i>
<i>this machine was actually designed</i>

373
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:53,083
<i>to detect alien life-forms</i>
<i>that might invade our system.</i>

374
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:55,375
<i>That sounds about right.</i>

375
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,416
<i>You wanna know if it's a girl or a boy?</i>

376
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,166
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

377
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,916
We're having a girl.

378
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,291
<i>A girl?</i>

379
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:10,541
<i>Nervous?</i>

380
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:12,791
<i>Are you?</i>

381
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,750
<i>I just didn't see this coming.</i>

382
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,791
<i>Well, you're only human.</i>

383
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,333
<i>Are you saying I couldn't help myself?</i>

384
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,000
<i>-No, you said that, not me.</i>
<i>-Did I say that?</i>

385
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,416
<i>I didn't see it coming either.</i>

386
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,833
<i>So, what are we gonna name her?</i>

387
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:37,666
<i>Trudy?</i>

388
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,750
<i>Roxy?</i>

389
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,958
<i>Penelope?</i>

390
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,791
<i>Margot?</i>

391
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,500
<i>Maggie?</i>

392
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,333
<i>Henrietta?</i>

393
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,916
<i>This'll do.</i>

394
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,291
<i>For now.</i>

395
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,916
<i>Is that your mom?</i>

396
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,041
<i>I knew a face like that once.</i>

397
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:37,208
<i>Yeah. Her hair was</i>
<i>a little different shade, but…</i>

398
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,958
<i>She was as loud as you are quiet.</i>

399
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,833
<i>When she'd laugh,</i>
<i>everybody would turn and look.</i>

400
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:52,875
<i>I think she'd laugh so much</i>

401
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:57,166
<i>because she was that much smarter</i>
<i>than everybody else, and she knew it.</i>

402
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:06,791
<i>I wish you'd tell me</i>
<i>something about your life, Iris.</i>

403
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,666
<i>Anything would do.</i>

404
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,333
<i>Hey, Iris.</i>

405
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:19,958
<i>Ask me a question.</i>

406
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:25,833
<i>Did you love her?</i>

407
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:27,875
<i>Run!</i>

408
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,541
<i>We shouldn't have stopped.</i>

409
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:14,125
<i>It's all we have.</i>

410
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,791
<i>No, thank you.</i>

411
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:26,958
<i>I like these better.</i>

412
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,250
<i>When we get to Lake Hazen,</i>

413
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:45,125
<i>there's gonna be every kind of food there.</i>

414
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,166
<i>There's gonna be</i>

415
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,458
<i>pizza…</i>

416
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,541
<i>and cheeseburgers.</i>

417
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:58,875
<i>Anything you want.</i>

418
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:03,958
<i>No peas.</i>

419
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:25,250
<i>We keep going in that direction.</i>

420
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:29,083
<i>Come on.</i>

421
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:14,083
<i>It's all right.</i>

422
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,166
<i>We're gonna be fine.</i>

423
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:21,791
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

424
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,041
<i>I see you!</i>

425
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:27,333
<i>I see you!</i>

426
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:39,958
<i>Iris?</i>

427
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:44,083
<i>Iris? I'm here!</i>

428
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,416
<i>Come to my voice!</i>

429
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,083
<i>I'm here.</i>

430
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:57,791
<i>There's no tracks.</i>

431
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,208
<i>Iris!</i>

432
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:05,916
<i>I'm here.</i>

433
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,208
<i>I'm here!</i>

434
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:18,375
<i>I'm here.</i>

435
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:25,250
<i>Iris?</i>

436
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,708
<i>I thought I'd lost you.</i>

437
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,833
<i>I thought I'd lost you.</i>

438
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,208
<i>Look what you did.</i>

439
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:44,708
<i>All good?</i>

440
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,791
<i>Just going where Sanchez tells me to go.</i>

441
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,375
<i>Anything from Sully?</i>

442
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:56,791
<i>Nothing yet. It's just a glitch.</i>

443
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,208
<i>You really believe that?</i>

444
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:03,541
<i>Until someone tells me different, Tom.</i>

445
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,208
<i>I understand it's a girl.</i>

446
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:15,166
<i>Yeah.</i>

447
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
<i>Hyacinth.</i>

448
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:26,208
<i>What?</i>

449
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:30,208
<i>It was my mother's name.</i>

450
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
<i>It's a flower.</i>

451
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:38,625
<i>Hyacinth?</i>

452
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,250
<i>Some kind of flower.</i>

453
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:08,416
81-40 North.

454
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,125
<i>72-58 West.</i>

455
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:13,041
<i>Are you there?</i>

456
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:20,083
<i>This is the spaceship Aether</i>
<i>returning from Jupiter Mission.</i>

457
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:22,291
<i>-Can you hear me?</i>
-Yes.

458
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,250
<i>Yes. I'm receiving.</i>

459
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,458
<i>This is Lake Hazen Weather Station.</i>

460
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:34,666
<i>Lake Hazen, I can't tell you</i>
<i>how happy I am to hear your voice.</i>

461
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:37,916
<i>For some reason, you're the only person</i>
<i>who wants to talk to me.</i>

462
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,333
<i>We've lost contact with NASA</i>
<i>and everyone else.</i>

463
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:43,416
<i>Do you have information</i>
<i>on our transmission blackout?</i>

464
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,833
<i>Lake Hazen, are you there?</i>

465
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:53,041
<i>How much have you picked up</i>
<i>about the conditions on Earth?</i>

466
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,541
<i>We've received nothing.</i>

467
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:58,041
I wish I--

468
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,416
<i>I'm sorry, Lake Hazen,</i>
<i>I missed that last transmission.</i>

469
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,041
<i>Is that Mission Control?</i>

470
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,291
<i>Lake Hazen, are you receiving this?</i>

471
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:16,458
<i>I don't know all the details.</i>
<i>I know it was a mistake.</i>

472
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,250
<i>It started with--</i>

473
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:21,666
<i>…also--</i>

474
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:31,958
<i>Lake Hazen, do you copy?</i>

475
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,625
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- I can't pull it up on radar.</i>

476
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:53,250
<i>-Can you rotate on this axis?</i>
<i>-Trying now.</i>

477
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,916
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

478
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,166
<i>It's what happens</i>
<i>when you fly in the goddamn dark.</i>

479
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:12,250
<i>Aether? Mission Specialist Sullivan,</i>
<i>do you copy? Hello?</i>

480
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:14,000
<i>Lake Hazen, can you hear me?</i>

481
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,000
<i>Lake Hazen, do you copy?</i>

482
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:49,291
<i>Stay on current</i>
<i>to assess any damage beyond the comms.</i>

483
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
<i>It's over.</i>

484
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:56,083
<i>For now.</i>

485
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,708
<i>Sully, bridge status.</i>

486
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,875
<i>Contained. There's damage to a lab wall.</i>

487
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:05,166
What's the status on
secondary and tertiary communications?

488
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,916
<i>Lost communications.</i>

489
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:10,666
<i>And lost radar.</i>

490
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,125
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

491
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:22,500
<i>Full reports on all systems,</i>
<i>and let's at least get the radar fixed.</i>

492
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:24,208
<i>On it.</i>

493
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,208
<i>Let's see what we got.</i>

494
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:33,708
<i>There's the lab wall.</i>

495
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,041
<i>The printer can fix that.</i>

496
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:41,500
<i>That's the radar.</i>

497
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,125
<i>Okay.</i>

498
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:53,041
<i>And there's the comms.</i>

499
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:56,541
<i>And there's the comms.</i>

500
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,125
<i>It can be rebuilt.</i>

501
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:06,958
<i>But it's gonna take a walk outside.</i>

502
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,791
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

503
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,875
<i>Stole it from the LM platform support.</i>

504
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:01,875
<i>NASA can worry about how to unload</i>
<i>their supply canisters when we get back.</i>

505
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,458
<i>That should do the trick.</i>

506
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,958
<i>Hey, Maya?</i>

507
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,875
<i>What do you think of the name Caroline?</i>

508
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:15,333
<i>It's okay.</i>

509
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,291
<i>Better than Hyacinth?</i>

510
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:20,166
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Yup.</i>

511
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:21,833
<i>How are we doing?</i>

512
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:23,583
<i>Should come in under the deadline.</i>

513
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:26,458
<i>I've been thinking.</i>
<i>It's gotta be me and Maya going out.</i>

514
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:31,250
<i>Okay, I'll probably tag along,</i>
<i>help carry that thing.</i>

515
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:35,375
<i>There's no gravity out there. It's not</i>
<i>gonna be too heavy for us girls to handle.</i>

516
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,125
<i>I don't like to miss a chance</i>
<i>to stroll around the block.</i>

517
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,708
<i>Is he going because he's worried about you</i>
<i>or because I've never walked before?</i>

518
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:52,416
<i>You've trained for this.</i>

519
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,291
<i>He wouldn't send you out</i>
<i>if he wasn't sure you could do it.</i>

520
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:59,708
<i>Good. As long as one of us is.</i>

521
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,375
<i>That's her fourth.</i>

522
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:17,958
<i>I mean, she's so small.</i>
<i>Where does it all keep coming from?</i>

523
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:24,583
<i>How you feeling?</i>

524
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,125
<i>I could throw up again.</i>

525
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,041
<i>Now you know how I feel.</i>

526
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,583
<i>Do it now</i>
<i>before you secure the helmet.</i>

527
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:37,583
<i>It's a bitch to get off.</i>

528
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,208
<i>You need help?</i>

529
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,458
<i>Thanks.</i>

530
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,458
<i>Now that's just wrong.</i>

531
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,041
<i>You good, Maya?</i>

532
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:21,916
<i>We can go as fast or slow</i>
<i>as you're comfortable out here.</i>

533
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,333
<i>That goes for you too, Sully.</i>

534
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,458
<i>No rush, understood?</i>

535
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:36,958
<i>My God.</i>

536
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:39,708
<i>No view quite like it.</i>

537
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:04,000
<i>- </i>There's your radar.
<i>- Yep.</i>

538
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,791
The installation site
should be coming up.

539
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:46,833
I see it.

540
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:55,208
<i>Twenty-five meters.</i>

541
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:58,333
<i>Twenty meters.</i>

542
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,208
<i>Got eyes on the antenna site.</i>

543
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:41,291
Hey, Sully.
What do you think of the name Florence?

544
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:44,500
<i>The kids would call her "Flo."</i>

545
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,291
<i>Yeah, good point.</i>

546
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:50,583
<i>How's the radar look?</i>

547
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:54,250
<i>Might just be knocked loose.</i>

548
01:16:55,916 --> 01:17:00,666
<i>We've got some detached wires,</i>
<i>but the nose is intact.</i>

549
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:05,250
<i>I'm sorry? Did you say "the nose"?</i>

550
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,833
<i>Everybody's a critic.</i>

551
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:14,250
<i>- Hey, Sanchez.</i>
<i>- Yep?</i>

552
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:16,208
<i>How about a little inspiration?</i>

553
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:19,875
<i>Ooh.</i>

554
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:22,708
<i>Yeah, I think I might have</i>
<i>the song for you.</i>

555
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:26,125
<i>Right here. Here you go. Enjoy, kids.</i>

556
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:32,541

01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:38,958

580
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,708
<i>Copy that. Give me a second.</i>

581
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,750
<i>All right, fantastic.</i>
<i>Rebooting now.</i>

582
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,458
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

583
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:22,500
<i>I am in the wrong profession.</i>

584
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:24,458
<i>I've been saying that for two years.</i>

585
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:27,208
<i>Maya, are we secure?</i>

586
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,041
<i>Yeah, just let me</i>
<i>finish this last connection.</i>

587
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:32,666
<i>Let's get back</i>
<i>and see who wants to talk to us.</i>

588
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,416
<i>- Sully, you take the lead.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

589
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:43,416
<i>Okay, everybody, good job. Sanchez?</i>

590
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,833
<i>Can't tell about comms,</i>
<i>but radar looks like--</i>

591
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,833
<i>What do we got?</i>

592
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:55,000
<i>Maya, move!</i>

593
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:08,000
<i>Ade, you need to move fast.</i>
<i>You need to go.</i>

594
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:10,208
<i>- Get out of there.</i>
<i>- Go now, Ade!</i>

595
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:13,541
<i>- </i>Maya! Get out of there now!
<i>- I'm stuck!</i>

596
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:16,750
<i>Maya! Move!</i>

597
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:45,666
<i>Sully!</i>

598
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,458
<i>I'm here, Ade!</i>

599
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:01,041
<i>That's it.</i>

600
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,208
<i>It's over.</i>

601
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:08,458
<i>Is everybody all right? Everybody safe?</i>

602
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,375
<i>-You okay?</i>
<i>-Son of a bitch!</i>

603
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:13,833
<i>What the fuck?</i>

604
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:15,541
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

605
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:18,875
<i>Let's get inside</i>
<i>before Maya breaks something else.</i>

606
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,000
<i>Me?</i>

607
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,583
<i>Status report?</i>

608
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,250
<i>Radar is still up, and…</i>

609
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,666
<i>comms is still up.</i>

610
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,666
<i>Punching in now. Fingers crossed on comms.</i>

611
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:41,875
<i>I need a drink.</i>

612
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:46,708
<i>I am gonna celebrate</i>
<i>the first and last time I walk in space.</i>

613
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:50,583
<i>No, no, I'm gonna have two drinks.</i>

614
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:52,375
We could all use a drink.

615
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,083
Who said that?

616
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:57,791
Sully.

617
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,375
<i>Help me.</i>

618
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:28,708
<i>Help-- Help me.</i>

619
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:29,833
<i>Maya?</i>

620
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,083
<i>Maya?</i>

621
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:46,541
<i>I'm bleeding.</i>

622
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,333
Penetration wound.

623
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:14,041
<i>Sanchez, have med-pack ready</i>
<i>to meet us in the airlock.</i>

624
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,666
<i>Sanchez is on it.</i>

625
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:18,291
<i>Ade, her oxygen levels are falling fast.</i>

626
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,458
<i>Let's get her tied down.</i>

627
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:33,625
<i>- What did I do wrong?</i>
<i>- You didn't do anything wrong.</i>

628
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:38,958
<i>Okay.</i>

629
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,208
<i>You're gonna be fine.</i>

630
01:23:47,916 --> 01:23:49,208
<i>Is it bad?</i>

631
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:51,833
<i>- Let's get this backpack off.</i>

632
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:55,875
<i>- Just breathe, Maya.</i>
<i>- Sanchez, get that med-pack in here!</i>

633
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:08,125
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

634
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,166
<i>Just breathe.</i>

635
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:14,583
<i>- That's it.</i>

636
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,375
<i>Thirty seconds!</i>

637
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:19,625
<i>I'm with you. Look at me. I'm with you.</i>

638
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,791
<i>-I'm gonna take your helmet off.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

639
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:23,791
<i>-Okay? You're gonna be fine.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

640
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,458
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

641
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:29,708
<i>Just breathe.</i>

642
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:32,666
<i>How long have we got? That's it.</i>

643
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:35,291
<i>- Ten seconds! Come on!</i>

644
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:45,583
<i>Now! Go! Clear!</i>

645
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,875
<i>- That's too much blood.</i>
<i>- It's okay.</i>

646
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:16,625
<i>- There's too much blood.</i>
<i>- You're okay.</i>

647
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:19,375
<i>- We don't have time. Put pressure.</i>
<i>- Here? Hang on.</i>

648
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:21,500
<i>-I got it.</i>
<i>-You got her?</i>

649
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:24,708
<i>There's too much blood.</i>
<i>Too much blood.</i>

650
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:29,208
<i>-I got it.</i>
<i>-You're gonna be fine. Okay?</i>

651
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,416
<i>Maya? Maya, breathe.</i>

652
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,708
<i>Maya, please breathe. Okay?</i>

653
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:36,833
<i>Puncture wound to the lower back.</i>

654
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:38,416
<i>Maya?</i>

655
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:43,333
<i>Maya?</i>

656
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:45,166
<i>- Maya?</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

657
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:48,500
<i>You're gonna be fine.</i>

658
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:50,791
<i>- You're gonna be fine. Yes.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

659
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,166
<i>- Maya.</i>
<i>- Why won't the blood stop?</i>

660
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:56,291
Keep looking at me.

661
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,333
<i>-Maya.</i>
<i>-I have to stay here.</i>

662
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,541
<i>- Okay, hold on.</i>
<i>- Mitchell, get us ready.</i>

663
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:05,958
<i>Maya. Keep looking at me.</i>
<i>Maya. Maya. Breathe.</i>

664
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:10,083
<i>- Please.</i>
<i>- I'm trying. I'm trying.</i>

665
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,250
<i>Maya.</i>

666
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:21,000
Just breathe. Breathe.

667
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:22,500
<i>Maya. Maya.</i>

668
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:30,833
<i>Lake Hazen, this is Aether.</i>
<i>Are you receiving?</i>

669
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:24,916
Captain,
we just got our first view of Earth.

670
01:30:28,916 --> 01:30:33,916
<i>I tied into the signals</i>
<i>of the old Astron satellite telescope.</i>

671
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,666
<i>What do we do?</i>

672
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:10,666
Lake Hazen,
this is Aether. Are you receiving?

673
01:31:13,791 --> 01:31:15,208
<i>I repeat,</i>

674
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:19,375
<i>Lake Hazen, this is Aether.</i>
<i>Are you receiving this transmission?</i>

675
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:24,500
<i>Lake Hazen, do you copy?</i>

676
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:27,208
<i>Yes, Aether.</i>

677
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:30,625
Our comm system went offline.

678
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:37,125
<i>We're operational now</i>
<i>and just got a visual on Earth.</i>

679
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:45,458
<i>I'm afraid we didn't do a good job</i>

680
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,875
<i>of looking after the place</i>
<i>while you were away.</i>

681
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:52,000
Do you see any new data

682
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:54,541
<i>that suggests possible</i>
<i>safe entry points for us?</i>

683
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,333
<i>No.</i>

684
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:06,875
<i>All survivable areas are underground.</i>

685
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:09,916
<i>And those are temporary.</i>

686
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,791
<i>I'd like to suggest something.</i>

687
01:32:23,416 --> 01:32:25,083
<i>Does this make sense to you?</i>

688
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:31,916
<i>If we want to get back to K-23, yes.</i>

689
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,666
<i>It's actually a pretty good plan.</i>

690
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:37,166
<i>Deviate our approach to Earth,</i>

691
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:41,416
<i>then make gravity our friend</i>
<i>to save fuel on the turnaround.</i>

692
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,541
<i>- Why would we do that?</i>
<i>- There's nothing left for us down there.</i>

693
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:48,000
<i>-We're not slingshotting back into space.</i>
<i>-We'll die if we go back.</i>

694
01:32:48,083 --> 01:32:50,791
<i>- He's still alive.</i>
<i>- Poles will be the last areas hit.</i>

695
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:53,250
<i>- Air contamination is rising.</i>
<i>- We don't know anything.</i>

696
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:54,583
<i>We all saw what it looked like.</i>

697
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:58,041
<i>Our mission was to go to K-23,</i>
<i>turn around, and come home.</i>

698
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,125
<i>We're going home.</i>

699
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:37,208
Lake Hazen,
are you still picking this up?

700
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,666
<i>I'm here, Aether.</i>

701
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:44,791
Lake Hazen, this is
Aether Flight Commander Gordon Adewole.

702
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,541
<i>Your numbers are intriguing,</i>

703
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:51,666
<i>but they have me curious</i>
<i>as to how you came up with them,</i>

704
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:54,458
<i>and how you know</i>
<i>so much about our flight plan.</i>

705
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:58,166
<i>Who exactly are you?</i>

706
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:03,666
Augustine Lofthouse.

707
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:10,041
<i>Dr. Lofthouse.</i>

708
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:15,375
<i>I had hoped to meet you upon our return.</i>

709
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:21,458
<i>Unfortunately, that seems</i>
<i>less likely as of the last few days.</i>

710
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:24,208
<i>Yes.</i>

711
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:30,916
Given your location,
are you certain there are no safe regions

712
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:33,083
<i>in the southern hemisphere?</i>

713
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:35,416
<i>Antarctica?</i>

714
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:39,541
<i>No, there's nowhere.</i>

715
01:34:51,666 --> 01:34:52,666
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

716
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:59,833
<i>We'll discuss our options up here</i>
<i>and hopefully, speak again.</i>

717
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:17,791
<i>There is a message for you.</i>

718
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:20,750
<i>It's downloading.</i>

719
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,041
<i>When was it sent?</i>

720
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:29,958
<i>Ten days ago.</i>

721
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,625
My love, I…

722
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:38,291
<i>Um, I don't know if you know</i>
<i>what's going on down here,</i>

723
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:42,291
<i>but, um, we're being asked to evacuate.</i>

724
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:46,000
<i>… the boys are sick.</i>

725
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:49,500
I…

726
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,458
<i>I want you to know where we're going,</i>

727
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:58,791
<i>because I won't be able</i>
<i>to contact you anymore.</i>

728
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:04,208
<i>I love you… so much.</i>

729
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,083
<i>Captain, you got a minute?</i>

730
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:48,208
<i>Of course.</i>

731
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:53,750
<i>It's funny when I think about</i>
<i>how long I've been doing this.</i>

732
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,583
<i>You know, 20 years ago, Kath and I,</i>

733
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,041
<i>we used to talk about the risks.</i>

734
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:08,083
<i>A certain amount</i>
<i>of danger is involved, and…</i>

735
01:37:09,583 --> 01:37:11,375
<i>we took that into account.</i>

736
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:16,541
<i>I was the one</i>
<i>that was supposed to be at risk.</i>

737
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:20,833
<i>And they were supposed to be safe.</i>

738
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:28,166
<i>Home…</i>

739
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:31,500
<i>and safe.</i>

740
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,041
<i>You have two reentry pods on this ship,</i>
<i>and I'd like to take one of them.</i>

741
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:40,291
<i>And you were right.</i>

742
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,375
<i>It's your job to turn the ship around,</i>
<i>start a new life.</i>

743
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:48,041
<i>Do better this time.</i>

744
01:37:50,291 --> 01:37:51,458
<i>But it's my job…</i>

745
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:56,083
<i>to keep a promise</i>
<i>that I made to my family.</i>

746
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,375
<i>I understand.</i>

747
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:03,791
<i>I'd feel the same way.</i>

748
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:06,625
<i>I know you would.</i>

749
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:48,916
<i>- It takes two to fly that.</i>
<i>- I'll manage.</i>

750
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:54,833
<i>I'm going to go with you.</i>

751
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:06,666
<i>-Why would you wanna do that?</i>
<i>-I've been thinking.</i>

752
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:09,916
<i>That's your first mistake.</i>

753
01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:15,500
<i>Been thinking a lot about time…</i>

754
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,750
<i>and how it gets used and why.</i>

755
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:25,208
<i>Why one person lives a lifetime</i>

756
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:28,458
<i>and another only gets a few years.</i>

757
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:37,458
<i>My daughter, Maria,</i>
<i>she died when she was four.</i>

758
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:41,791
<i>She would have been the same age as Maya.</i>

759
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:47,458
<i>Sometimes at night, when I couldn't sleep,</i>

760
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:51,208
<i>I would pretend that they were friends.</i>

761
01:39:52,416 --> 01:39:54,125
<i>They'd talk about school together.</i>

762
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:55,750
<i>Or boys.</i>

763
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:11,625
<i>I want to take Maya home.</i>

764
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:15,833
<i>It seems like the best use of my time.</i>

765
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:27,833
<i>So I was thinking I'll take</i>
<i>a ride home with my buddy, if that's okay.</i>

766
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:33,083
<i>Okay.</i>

767
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:12,833
<i>Bye, Sully.</i>

768
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:19,541
<i>Take care of yourself, okay?</i>
<i>And our little Caroline.</i>

769
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,625
<i>I hope you find your family.</i>

770
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:15,583
<i>Wish us luck.</i>

771
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,083
<i>Good luck.</i>

772
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:32,000
<i>This is Aether. Are you receiving?</i>

773
01:43:35,541 --> 01:43:37,500
Dr. Lofthouse, can you hear me?

774
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:39,375
<i>I hear you.</i>

775
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:45,541
We're headed into
an ionization blackout,

776
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:47,125
<i>so I'm gonna lose you soon.</i>

777
01:43:48,708 --> 01:43:51,708
<i>But I wanted to</i>
<i>contact you first to thank you.</i>

778
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:55,541
<i>Commander Adewole and I are turning back.</i>

779
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,250
<i>That's good.</i>

780
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:08,500
Captain Mitchell
and Specialist Sanchez decided on reentry.

781
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,125
<i>They have family down here?</i>

782
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:16,958
Yes.

783
01:44:22,458 --> 01:44:23,708
I understand.

784
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:30,375
<i>Flight Engineer Maya Lawrence,</i>

785
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:33,458
<i>she suffered</i>
<i>an accident during the flight.</i>

786
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:41,208
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

787
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,041
<i>What you did…</i>

788
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:53,208
<i>You discovered so much up here.</i>

789
01:44:59,166 --> 01:45:00,458
<i>I just point.</i>

790
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:07,750
Well, you pointed
to an incredible world.

791
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:11,208
<i>I wish you could have seen it.</i>

792
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:20,333
Lake Hazen will have to do.

793
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:25,625
<i>How did you end up there?</i>

794
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:33,666
<i>I thought maybe I could help someone.</i>

795
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:37,583
Well, you've definitely done that.

796
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,708
<i>You know, you're one of the reasons</i>
<i>I joined the space program.</i>

797
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:47,916
<i>You had done some work</i>
<i>with my mother, Jean Sullivan.</i>

798
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:51,208
<i>She brought home a moon rock you gave her.</i>

799
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:55,125
<i>I thought it was</i>
<i>the most amazing thing ever.</i>

800
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:57,833
<i>It made me want to go up and find more.</i>

801
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:04,583
<i>I wish I could have thanked you</i>
<i>for it in person, Dr. Lofthouse.</i>

802
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:08,208
<i>Augustine.</i>

803
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:11,250
<i>Augustine.</i>

804
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,416
<i>And I'm Iris.</i>

805
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:20,708
<i>I know.</i>

806
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:44,583
<i>It's very nice to finally meet you.</i>

807
01:46:51,875 --> 01:46:53,791
<i>What's it like there, Iris?</i>

808
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:56,500
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

809
01:46:58,041 --> 01:46:59,333
<i>It's amazing.</i>

810
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:05,541
<i>The colony site, it feels like Colorado.</i>

811
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:11,125
<i>Have you ever been there,</i>
<i>to the mountains?</i>

812
01:47:12,958 --> 01:47:15,083
<i>Yes.</i>

813
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:20,500
<i>The air is so crisp, and…</i>

814
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:23,958
<i>and the planet has that smell.</i>

815
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:27,583
<i>It's like pine trees</i>
<i>are hidden somewhere underground</i>,

816
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:29,166
<i>waiting to burst through.</i>

817
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:35,125
<i>First weeks we were there,</i>

818
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:38,250
<i>I kept looking up,</i>
<i>expecting to see a blue sky,</i>

819
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,791
<i>but it was orange</i>

820
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,500
<i>from the light reflecting off Jupiter.</i>

821
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:48,041
<i>When the orbit is just right,</i>

822
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:51,791
<i>Jupiter feels so close that…</i>

823
01:47:54,666 --> 01:47:56,666
<i>you're sure you could almost touch it.</i>

824
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:02,750
<i>And that light, it makes</i>
<i>all the colors explode, everything.</i>

825
01:48:04,166 --> 01:48:05,541
<i>Water…</i>

826
01:48:07,166 --> 01:48:08,500
<i>flowers…</i>

827
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:13,833
<i>It's like landing in Oz</i>
<i>and seeing real color for the first time.</i>

828
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:21,625
<i>I've never seen anything so beautiful.</i>

829
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:32,041
<i>Dr. Lofthouse?</i>

830
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:36,416
<i>Augustine?</i>

831
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:43,583
<i>Think I lost him.</i>

832
01:48:49,208 --> 01:48:50,708
<i>I guess it's just us now.</i>

833
01:48:56,125 --> 01:48:57,125
<i>Just us?</i>
