01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:34,919
May?

652
01:02:35,211 --> 01:02:36,629
It's not him.

653
01:02:38,965 --> 01:02:42,218
-It's not, uh? 
-[May] No, it's not.

654
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,387
Oh, too bad.

655
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:46,014
Who is it, then?

656
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:49,351
[May] Somebody else.

657
01:02:51,644 --> 01:02:56,358
It's a big, huge, extra-long black Mercedes Benz.

658
01:02:57,317 --> 01:02:59,319
[Eddie] This is a motel, isn't it?

659
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:02,572
Rich people have to sleep too.

660
01:03:04,324 --> 01:03:07,911
[May] This ain't a black Mercedes Benz type
of motel, Eddie.

661
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:13,375
Somebody's just standing out there
in front of that car.

662
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:15,919
Just standing there looking at me.

663
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:19,089
What are they doing?

664
01:03:21,132 --> 01:03:25,053
I don't think it's a they, Eddie. 
I think it's a she.

665
01:03:25,345 --> 01:03:27,097
May, get away from the door. Come on!

666
01:03:27,389 --> 01:03:28,306
You wouldn't happen to know anybody

667
01:03:28,598 --> 01:03:30,225
with a black Mercedes Benz, would you, Eddie?

668
01:03:30,517 --> 01:03:31,684
-[gunshot] 
-[May screams]

669
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:32,811
Stay down, okay?

670
01:03:33,103 --> 01:03:34,062
[May] Who the hell is that?

671
01:03:34,354 --> 01:03:36,648
[Eddie] How should I know? 
Just stay down, okay?

672
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,316
It's okay.

673
01:03:39,526 --> 01:03:42,070
-[gunshots] 
-[May screams]

674
01:03:42,362 --> 01:03:45,365
[music starts playing on the jukebox]

675
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:48,701
[Eddie] I don't know who she is. 
Just stay down.

676
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:51,538
[both arguing]

677
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:52,956
[gunshot]

678
01:03:53,248 --> 01:03:56,459
[May] You don't know her? 
That's the kind of car a countess drives.

679
01:03:56,751 --> 01:03:59,504
-Stay down! 
-[May shouts]

680
01:03:59,796 --> 01:04:01,131
-[gunshot] 
-[glass breaking]

681
01:04:01,423 --> 01:04:04,134
-[Eddie] You okay? Stay down. 
-[May] I'm down!

682
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:06,469
-How crazy is she? 
-[Eddie] Pretty crazy.

683
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:09,806
-Just stay down. 
-Have you balled her yet?

684
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:13,059
-[engine revving] 
-[screams]

685
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:24,112
[Eddie] She's blown the goddamn windshield
out of my truck!

686
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:26,614
She what?

687
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:29,451
She blew the windshield out of my goddamn truck!

688
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:30,869
You should've thought of this!

689
01:04:31,161 --> 01:04:33,538
[Eddie] Where are you going? Wait a second.

690
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:36,374
-Keep those lights off. 
-Don't you tell me what to do!

691
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:39,002
[Eddie] She's gonna come back. 
We gotta get outta here.

692
01:04:39,294 --> 01:04:40,837
-We gotta get your stuff
-Stop it!

693
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:43,131
Don't you dare pick me up!

694
01:04:44,466 --> 01:04:48,052
[May shouting]

695
01:04:48,344 --> 01:04:49,929
Put me down!

696
01:04:50,221 --> 01:04:53,016
I came here to get you. 
What's the matter with you?

697
01:04:53,308 --> 01:04:54,851
I came all this way to get you.

698
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:56,728
Do you think I'd do that for anybody else?

699
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,855
[harmonica playing]

700
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:02,275
-[May screaming] Put me down! 
-[Eddie] Listen to me!

701
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:05,361
[Old Man] The amazing thing is, neither one
of you look a bit familiar to me.

702
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:07,071
[May and Eddie continue arguing]

703
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:09,491
[Old Man] Can't figure that one out.

704
01:05:09,782 --> 01:05:12,660
I don't recognize myself in either one of you. 
Never have.

705
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:17,916
Now get your stuff. We're getting outta here.

706
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:21,544
No, I'm not leaving, 
but you're leaving for sure!

707
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,380
You broke my bed.

708
01:05:24,672 --> 01:05:26,716
I am not leaving without you, May.

709
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:29,177
If you're staying here, I'm staying here.

710
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,054
You'll never get rid of me.

711
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:34,766
I'll track you down, no matter where you go.

712
01:05:35,058 --> 01:05:37,435
I know exactly how your mind works.

713
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:39,604
I've been right every time.

714
01:05:39,896 --> 01:05:41,356
Every single time.

715
01:05:42,482 --> 01:05:44,817
You gotta give this up, Eddie.

716
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:48,071
I don't know what's in your head any more, 
I really don't.

717
01:05:48,363 --> 01:05:51,157
Now you desperately need me?

718
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:53,785
Now you can't live without me?

719
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:58,122
Why should I believe you now?

720
01:05:59,332 --> 01:06:00,833
'Cause it's true?

721
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,461
Cause it was supposed to be true
every other time.

722
01:06:03,753 --> 01:06:07,131
Every other time before this, 
and it's true again.

723
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:09,634
You've been jerking me off for 15 years.

724
01:06:09,926 --> 01:06:11,636
For 15 years I've been a yo-yo to you.

725
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,683
You know what? I never been split either.

726
01:06:16,975 --> 01:06:19,310
I never thought one way or another about it.

727
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:21,938
I either loved you or I didn't love you.

728
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:24,941
You know what, Eddie?

729
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:28,027
Now I just plain don't love you.

730
01:06:29,112 --> 01:06:31,114
You understand?

731
01:06:31,406 --> 01:06:34,325
You hear me, Eddie? You understand?

732
01:06:35,702 --> 01:06:37,954
I don't love you,

733
01:06:38,246 --> 01:06:41,791
I don't need you and I don't want you.

734
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:44,127
-You get it? 
-[Eddie] Get in the bathroom.

735
01:06:44,419 --> 01:06:46,254
[screaming] I'm not getting in the bathroom!

736
01:06:47,297 --> 01:06:49,507
[May] I'm not gonna hide in my own house!

737
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:50,925
I'm gonna go out

738
01:06:51,217 --> 01:06:54,178
and I'm gonna tear her damn head off!

739
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:55,805
-[Eddie] May
-[May] I'm gonna whack her ass.

740
01:06:56,097 --> 01:06:57,682
That's right! Come on in here

741
01:06:57,974 --> 01:07:01,269
with your damn gun. Bring all your weapons.

742
01:07:01,561 --> 01:07:03,813
-[car door closes] 
-[May keeps shouting]

743
01:07:05,148 --> 01:07:07,525
[May screams]

744
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:10,945
Stop!

745
01:07:11,237 --> 01:07:13,990
No!

746
01:07:14,282 --> 01:07:17,327
Oh, no. It's all right.

747
01:07:17,619 --> 01:07:21,539
It's all right. 
We were just having an argument. It's okay.

748
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:25,293
It's okay. It's just a little argument, that's all.

749
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:27,587
Oh, God.

750
01:07:27,879 --> 01:07:29,881
I heard you screaming when I drove up

751
01:07:30,173 --> 01:07:31,341
and then all the lights went out.

752
01:07:31,633 --> 01:07:35,511
I thought someone was trying to...

753
01:07:35,803 --> 01:07:37,597
No, they weren't.

754
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:41,184
I better turn my truck lights off.

755
01:07:41,476 --> 01:07:42,727
The battery will run down.

756
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:43,978
[May] Yeah, you better.

757
01:07:47,398 --> 01:07:50,818
It sure looked like you were getting, you know...

758
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:53,821
[May] No, I wasn't.

759
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:56,199
-[Eddie] That's him? 
-I'm gonna kill you.

760
01:07:56,491 --> 01:07:58,368
[laughs and groans]

761
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:04,332
Oh, Martin, this is...

762
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:06,959
This is my cousin.

763
01:08:08,044 --> 01:08:10,129
-Eddie. 
-[Eddie laughing]

764
01:08:11,756 --> 01:08:14,258
-I'm sorry. 
-She's lying.

765
01:08:17,387 --> 01:08:19,472
Oh, no. You wanna come on in

766
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:22,016
and have a drink. I bet you need one after this.

767
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:24,102
Yes, sure.

768
01:08:24,394 --> 01:08:29,565
[nervously] I'm gonna have to get you a... 
Wash you a glass, okay?

769
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:31,317
-Yeah. 
-[May] Okay?

770
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:32,402
Okay.

771
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,492
She keeps the glasses in the bathroom. 
Isn't that weird?

772
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:45,456
I was starting to think you weren't gonna come.

773
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:46,708
[Martin] I'm sorry.

774
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:50,837
I had to water the football field down
at the high school.

775
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:52,880
-Forgot all about it. 
-[May] You did?

776
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:56,175
-Forgot all about what? 
-I forgot about the watering.

777
01:08:56,467 --> 01:08:59,178
I was halfway here when I remembered.

778
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:01,180
There you go.

779
01:09:01,472 --> 01:09:03,558
[Eddie] I thought you forgot about her.

780
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:05,435
[scoffs] Oh, no.

781
01:09:06,978 --> 01:09:09,397
How far was halfway?

782
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:11,023
[banging]

783
01:09:12,984 --> 01:09:14,068
Excuse me?

784
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:18,489
How far was it when you were halfway here?

785
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:21,159
I don't know. I guess a couple of miles or so.

786
01:09:21,451 --> 01:09:25,455
A couple of miles? A couple of lousy, stinking miles?

787
01:09:25,747 --> 01:09:27,290
[Eddie screaming] You wanna know how
many miles I came?

788
01:09:27,582 --> 01:09:28,666
You wanna know?

789
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:32,295
-Huh? 
-Agh! I'm so sorry.

790
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,133
It's okay. We've been drinking a little bit.

791
01:09:38,134 --> 01:09:39,886
[Eddie] She's in deep shit.

792
01:09:40,178 --> 01:09:41,512
[whispers] I'm gonna kill you.

793
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:45,224
What's the matter, May?

794
01:09:46,434 --> 01:09:49,353
What? Nothing.

795
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,691
[Martin] How come you had all the lights off?

796
01:09:55,276 --> 01:09:58,154
Oh, yeah, we were gonna go out.

797
01:09:58,738 --> 01:09:59,739
But you--

798
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:02,241
I mean, we were gonna go out 
and we were gonna come back.

799
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,702
No, no, no!

800
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:07,663
That's not what we were gonna do.

801
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:12,710
That's not what we were gonna do, Marty. No.

802
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:17,298
We were actually having
a big argument about you.

803
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:21,886
-About me? 
-[Eddie] Uh-huh.

804
01:10:22,178 --> 01:10:25,306
We were in the middle 
of a big argument about you.

805
01:10:25,598 --> 01:10:28,142
It got so heated up, 
we had to turn the lights off.

806
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:32,897
-He's just joking. 
-What was it about?

807
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:34,273
[Eddie laughing]

808
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:39,695
[Eddie] It was about whether 
or not you're actually a man or not.

809
01:10:41,614 --> 01:10:45,493
Whether you're a man or just a guy.

810
01:10:45,785 --> 01:10:47,620
[mouths]

811
01:10:47,912 --> 01:10:49,163
See, she says

812
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:51,999
that you're a man. Did you know that?

813
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:55,169
Did you know that's what she calls you? 
A man.

814
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:56,838
No, I didn't know that.

815
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:58,798
Martin, I didn't call you a man. 
Just don't worry about it.

816
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,633
It's okay. I don't mind it.

817
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,555
Didn't we say we were going to the movies?

818
01:11:05,847 --> 01:11:07,932
Yeah, sure. That's what I thought.

819
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:10,560
[May] We drink on up and we go, okay?

820
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:12,854
[Eddie grunts]

821
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:15,982
[May] I'll be back.

822
01:11:21,863 --> 01:11:23,322
[grunting]

823
01:11:25,992 --> 01:11:27,660
[Martin] She's not mad or anything, is she?

824
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:31,414
I didn't mean to make her mad.

825
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:32,832
[Eddie] Huh.

826
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:53,144
What are you gonna go see, Marty?

827
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:56,105
I can't decide.

828
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,402
What do you mean you can't decide?

829
01:12:01,694 --> 01:12:03,946
You're supposed to have all that worked
 out ahead of time, aren't you?

830
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:06,949
[Martin] Yeah, but I'm not sure what she likes.

831
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:08,451
[Eddie] What difference does that make?

832
01:12:08,743 --> 01:12:10,620
You're taking her out to movies, right?

833
01:12:10,912 --> 01:12:12,622
[Martin] Yeah.

834
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:16,584
You pick the movie. 
The guy is supposed to pick the movie.

835
01:12:16,876 --> 01:12:19,712
The guy always picks the movie.

836
01:12:20,004 --> 01:12:22,506
[Martin] Yeah, but I don't wanna take her

837
01:12:22,798 --> 01:12:24,133
to something she doesn't wanna see.

838
01:12:24,425 --> 01:12:26,928
How do you know what she wants to see?

839
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:30,264
[Martin] I don't. 
That's the reason I can't decide.

840
01:12:30,556 --> 01:12:31,349
Uh-huh.

841
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:34,936
What if I take her to something
she's seen before?

842
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:37,772
[Eddie] No, you missed the whole point, Marty.

843
01:12:38,064 --> 01:12:40,942
The reason you're taking her out to the movies

844
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:44,737
isn't to see something 
that she hasn't seen before.

845
01:12:45,613 --> 01:12:47,573
-No? 
-[Eddie] No.

846
01:12:47,865 --> 01:12:50,326
The reason you're taking her out to the movies

847
01:12:50,618 --> 01:12:53,287
is you just wanna be with her, right?

848
01:12:53,579 --> 01:12:57,708
You just wanna... be close to her, right?

849
01:13:00,962 --> 01:13:03,798
-Yeah, I guess. 
-[Eddie] Yeah.

850
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:06,008
You could take her just about anywhere.

851
01:13:07,677 --> 01:13:11,722
After a while, you probably won't even have
to take her out at all.

852
01:13:12,014 --> 01:13:15,184
You can hang around here, 
save yourself a lot of money.

853
01:13:15,726 --> 01:13:17,019
[Martin] Yeah.

854
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:21,440
-[Eddie] Oops. 
-What' we do here?

855
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:25,695
Well, you could...

856
01:13:25,987 --> 01:13:29,991
You could... tell each other stories.

857
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:31,534
-Stories? 
-[Eddie] Yeah.

858
01:13:31,826 --> 01:13:34,537
-I don't know any stories. 
-Well, make 'em up.

859
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:35,705
That'd be lying, wouldn't it?

860
01:13:35,997 --> 01:13:40,209
[Eddie] No. Only when you believe it's true.

861
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:43,587
If you already know it's a lie, then it's not lying.

862
01:13:43,879 --> 01:13:47,967
-You want a hand up off the floor? 
-[Eddie] No.

863
01:13:48,259 --> 01:13:50,761
I like it down here. There's less tension.

864
01:13:51,053 --> 01:13:53,848
You notice when you're standing up
there's a lot more tension?

865
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,182
[Martin] Yeah, I noticed it.

866
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:58,894
A lot of times when I'm working 
I'm down on my hands and knees.

867
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:01,022
What line of work do you follow, Martin?

868
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:02,565
Yard work, mostly.

869
01:14:02,857 --> 01:14:08,487
[Eddie] Oh. You mean lawns and stuff?

870
01:14:09,155 --> 01:14:10,072
Yeah, maintenance.

871
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:12,742
You do lawns on your hands and knees?

872
01:14:13,034 --> 01:14:15,411
Well, edging. Trimming around the edges.

873
01:14:15,703 --> 01:14:16,954
[Eddie] Oh, yeah?

874
01:14:17,246 --> 01:14:19,373
[Martin] Weeding around the sprinkler heads, 
stuff like that.

875
01:14:19,665 --> 01:14:20,750
[Eddie] I get you.

876
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:24,712
Yeah, I always noticed how much
more relaxed I get

877
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:29,050
when I'm down on my hands and knees, 
close to the ground.

878
01:14:29,341 --> 01:14:32,178
[Eddie] You can get down on your hands
and knees right now

879
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,597
if you want to, Martin. I don't mind.

880
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:38,434
-No, I'll stand, thanks. 
-[Eddie] Suit yourself.

881
01:14:38,726 --> 01:14:43,314
[in a deep voice] You're just gonna get more
and more tense.

882
01:14:43,606 --> 01:14:45,483
Huh? [Eddie laughing]

883
01:14:45,775 --> 01:14:48,986
So you're May's cousin, huh?

884
01:14:49,278 --> 01:14:50,946
Yeah. See that right there?

885
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:54,658
That's the result of tension, asking me that.

886
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:55,826
What?

887
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:58,662
Asking me if I'm her cousin. 
You know I'm not her cousin.

888
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:00,539
How would I know that?

889
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:02,500
[Eddie] Do I look like her cousin?

890
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:03,626
[Martin] Well, she said that you were.

891
01:15:03,918 --> 01:15:05,086
[Eddie] She's lying.

892
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:08,506
What are you, then?

893
01:15:10,883 --> 01:15:13,469
[Eddie] You're really getting tense.

894
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:15,346
Maybe I just better go on.

895
01:15:15,638 --> 01:15:18,432
[Eddie] No, wait. Martin, don't go.

896
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:20,392
Don't go, Marty.

897
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:24,688
It is blue and lonely out there in the black night.

898
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,857
I'll tell you what.

899
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:29,902
Let's go over to the bar and have us a little drink.

900
01:15:30,194 --> 01:15:31,695
What do you say? Okay?

901
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:32,613
She gonna be okay?

902
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:35,574
[Eddie] Yeah. She's always okay.

903
01:15:35,866 --> 01:15:40,079
She's just taking her time just to torture you.

904
01:15:40,371 --> 01:15:41,747
How will she know where we went?

905
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:44,125
She knows. She's got a sixth sense.

906
01:15:57,513 --> 01:16:00,724
[Eddie] Come on, Marty. Come on. There we go.

907
01:16:01,016 --> 01:16:03,561
There we go. There we go.

908
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,348
What exactly is the matter with May anyway?

909
01:16:42,683 --> 01:16:44,351
[Eddie] She's in a state of shock.

910
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:47,354
[Martin] Shock? How come?

911
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:49,481
[Eddie] Well...

912
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:52,276
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

913
01:16:52,568 --> 01:16:57,740
Me and her, we go back quite a way. 
High school.

914
01:16:58,032 --> 01:16:59,867
Oh, really?

915
01:17:01,076 --> 01:17:02,077
I didn't know that.

916
01:17:02,369 --> 01:17:04,205
Yeah. A lot of miles.

917
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:08,292
So you're not really cousins, then?

918
01:17:08,584 --> 01:17:12,254
[Eddie] Well, not really, no.

919
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:17,760
-You're her husband? 
-No.

920
01:17:19,845 --> 01:17:21,013
No.

921
01:17:31,774 --> 01:17:33,734
She's my sister.

922
01:17:37,738 --> 01:17:40,157
-Your sister? 
-[Eddie] Mmm-hmm.

923
01:17:40,449 --> 01:17:44,536
Hmm. So you knew each other even
before high school?

924
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:48,165
No. I never even knew I had a sister
until it was too late.

925
01:17:48,457 --> 01:17:49,583
How do you mean?

926
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:52,378
By the time I found out, we'd already...

927
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:58,509
you know, fooled around.

928
01:18:02,346 --> 01:18:03,597
[swallows]

929
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,517
[pouring]

930
01:18:09,228 --> 01:18:13,232
-You fooled around? 
-[Eddie] Yeah. Mm-hm.

931
01:18:16,944 --> 01:18:19,280
That's illegal, isn't it?

932
01:18:19,571 --> 01:18:22,783
-Only if you get caught. 
-Hey. Who is this guy?

933
01:18:23,075 --> 01:18:25,286
[Martin] Is that true? She's really your sister?

934
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:26,954
[Eddie] Half. Only half.

935
01:18:27,246 --> 01:18:29,915
-Which half? 
-The top half.

936
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:32,042
In horses, we call that the top side.

937
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:33,752
[Old Man] And the mare is what?

938
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:38,173
The mare is distaff.

939
01:18:38,465 --> 01:18:40,926
Ain't that the bottom half? Distaff.

940
01:18:41,218 --> 01:18:43,762
It's funny I should remember that.

941
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:51,812
You fooled around in high school together?

942
01:18:52,104 --> 01:18:53,939
Yeah, sure. Everybody fooled around in high school.

943
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:55,691
-Didn't you, Marty? 
-No, I never did.

944
01:18:55,983 --> 01:18:58,694
-Maybe you should have. 
-Not with my sister, anyway.

945
01:18:58,986 --> 01:19:01,196
[Eddie] I wouldn't recommend that.

946
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:09,330
How could that happen? I mean...

947
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:11,999
Well, see...

948
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:18,756
Our daddy fell in love twice.

949
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:23,969
That's basically how it happened.

950
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:28,891
Once with my mom and once with her mom.

951
01:19:29,183 --> 01:19:30,726
It was the same love,

952
01:19:31,018 --> 01:19:33,354
it just got split in two, that's all.

953
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:41,695
How come you didn't know each other
until high school?

954
01:19:41,987 --> 01:19:45,115
He lived two separate lives.

955
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:49,078
[Eddie] Two completely separate lives.

956
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:53,749
He'd live with me and my mom for a while

957
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:57,086
and then he'd go and live with her and her mom.

958
01:19:57,378 --> 01:19:59,171
Don't be too hard on me, boy.

959
01:19:59,463 --> 01:20:02,257
It's happened to the best of us.

960
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:06,011
You never knew what was going on?

961
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:08,097
No.

962
01:20:09,515 --> 01:20:12,893
Never knew. Neither did my mother.

963
01:20:13,185 --> 01:20:15,020
-She knew. 
-She never knew.

964
01:20:15,312 --> 01:20:17,940
She must have suspected something was going on.

965
01:20:18,816 --> 01:20:19,733
[Eddie] Well...

966
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:24,488
if she did, she never let on to me about it.

967
01:20:27,825 --> 01:20:30,828
Maybe she was afraid of finding out.

968
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:36,333
Or maybe she just...

969
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:39,169
loved him. I don't know.

970
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:42,506
He'd disappear.

971
01:20:44,258 --> 01:20:46,760
Months at a time he'd disappear.

972
01:20:50,389 --> 01:20:53,016
She never once asked where he went.

973
01:20:53,308 --> 01:20:54,476
[horn honking]

974
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:56,854
[Eddie] She was always glad to see him, though.

975
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,150
I remember,

976
01:21:01,442 --> 01:21:03,902
me and her, 
we used to go running out of the house

977
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:06,238
to meet him as soon as we saw him

978
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:10,159
coming up in the old Studebaker driving
across the fields.

979
01:21:10,451 --> 01:21:11,869
[Older Man] It was a Willis.

980
01:21:13,662 --> 01:21:16,915
I never owned a goddamn Studebaker.

981
01:21:18,876 --> 01:21:20,669
It was a Willis Knight.

982
01:21:28,177 --> 01:21:30,220
[door closes]

983
01:21:30,512 --> 01:21:32,389
[Martin] How did you finally find out

984
01:21:32,681 --> 01:21:34,892
that she was your sister?

985
01:21:36,185 --> 01:21:38,604
[Eddie] This went on for years, see.

986
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:42,316
Honey.

987
01:21:42,608 --> 01:21:45,611
[Eddie] He kept disappearing and then reappearing.

988
01:21:52,743 --> 01:21:57,206
And then, one day, it stopped.

989
01:22:01,543 --> 01:22:03,128
He just stayed home for a while.

990
01:22:07,466 --> 01:22:10,552
He stayed in the house. He never went outside.

991
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:18,018
He just sat in his chair, staring.

992
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:21,522
Then he started going on these walks.

993
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:24,441
[singing]

994
01:22:24,733 --> 01:22:25,943
[Eddie] He'd go on these long walks

995
01:22:26,235 --> 01:22:28,987
and he'd walk all day and he'd walk all night.

996

-[Old Man saying hello]

[Old Man] Ellie!

998
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:38,622
[Eddie] He'd just disappear in the dark.

999
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:44,962
[indistinct chatter]

1000
01:22:49,466 --> 01:22:53,470
[Eddie] I remember watching him
from my bedroom window.

1001
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,682
He'd just disappear in the dark

1002
01:22:56,974 --> 01:22:58,392
with his overcoat on.

1003
01:23:00,394 --> 01:23:02,396
[Martin] Where was he going?

1004
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:06,191
[Eddie] Just walking.

1005
01:23:09,528 --> 01:23:11,196
[clears throat] I was making a decision.

1006
01:23:13,115 --> 01:23:15,075
And one night...

1007
01:23:17,244 --> 01:23:18,954
I asked him if I could go with him.

1008
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:27,254
And he took me.

1009
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:32,968
We walked straight out across the fields together.

1010
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:35,721
I remember it was just ploughed

1011
01:23:36,013 --> 01:23:38,473
and our feet sank down in the powder.

1012
01:23:40,017 --> 01:23:43,103
[Eddie] The dirt came up over the tops of my shoes

1013
01:23:43,395 --> 01:23:44,646
and weighed me down.

1014
01:23:44,938 --> 01:23:47,899
I wanted to stop and empty my shoes
out but he wouldn't stop.

1015
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,902
He kept walking straight ahead.

1016
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:52,487
[indistinct chatter]

1017
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:54,031
I was afraid of losing him in the dark,

1018
01:23:54,323 --> 01:23:56,241
so I just kept up as best I could.

1019
01:24:02,372 --> 01:24:05,042
And we were completely silent the whole time.

1020
01:24:06,335 --> 01:24:08,337
We never said a word to each other.

1021
01:24:09,463 --> 01:24:11,548
We could barely see a foot in front of us

1022
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,343
and these white owls kept swooping down out of nowhere,

1023
01:24:14,635 --> 01:24:16,511
hunting for jack rabbits,

1024
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:20,015
diving right past our heads and disappearing.

1025
01:24:20,307 --> 01:24:22,351
We just kept walking silent like that for miles

1026
01:24:22,643 --> 01:24:23,977
until we got to town.

1027
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:31,777
I remember seeing the old man through
the glass door

1028
01:24:32,069 --> 01:24:34,237
of the liquor store as he paid for the bottle.

1029
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,950
-[Old Man] Three what? 3.12? 
-[clerk] No, 3.33.

1030
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:41,870
[Old Man] Three, thirty-three.

1031
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,126
Have a good evening.

1032
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:49,461
[Eddie] Then he came outside

1033
01:24:49,753 --> 01:24:51,755
with the bottle wrapped in a brown paper sack.

1034
01:24:52,047 --> 01:24:56,468
[Old Man] Wait a minute, what are you doing? 
Attacking me or something?

1035
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,971
[Eddie] He opened the bottle up and offered it to me.

1036
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:03,058
Before he even took a drink, 
he offered it to me first.

1037
01:25:04,184 --> 01:25:06,937
I took it and drank it and handed it back to him.

1038
01:25:08,313 --> 01:25:10,565
We just kept passing it back and forth like that

1039
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:13,568
till we drank the whole thing dry.

1040
01:25:15,028 --> 01:25:17,072
Finally we reached this little white house

1041
01:25:17,364 --> 01:25:20,409
with a red awning on the far side of town.

1042
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:23,912

1044
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:29,751
[Eddie] We walked right up to the front porch

1045
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:32,254
and he rang the bell.

1046
01:25:32,546 --> 01:25:33,880
[doorbell ringing]

1047
01:25:37,843 --> 01:25:41,096
[continues singing]

1048
01:25:55,444 --> 01:25:56,737
[Eddie] I remember getting real nervous

1049
01:25:57,028 --> 01:25:59,698
because I wasn't expecting to visit anybody.

1050
01:26:01,366 --> 01:26:05,412
And then this woman comes to the door.

1051
01:26:05,704 --> 01:26:06,872
[harmonica playing]

1052
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:11,042
This real pretty woman with red hair.

1053
01:26:11,334 --> 01:26:13,295
And she throws herself into his arms

1054
01:26:13,587 --> 01:26:14,629
I'm not that kind of a guy.

1055
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:16,131
[Eddie] And he starts crying.

1056
01:26:16,423 --> 01:26:18,800
He just breaks down right there in front of me.

1057
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:21,052
[woman] I'll show you what kind of guy you are.

1058
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:24,055
[Eddie] She's kissing him all on the face.

1059
01:26:24,347 --> 01:26:26,641
He's just crying like a little baby.

1060
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:33,106
And then...

1061
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:41,740
through the doorway behind them both, 
I see this girl.

1062
01:26:44,326 --> 01:26:46,286
She just appears.

1063
01:26:49,122 --> 01:26:51,875
She's just standing there staring at me.

1064
01:26:57,464 --> 01:26:59,758
And I'm staring back at her.

1065
01:27:05,764 --> 01:27:08,642
Can't take our eyes off each other.

1066

It was like...

1067
01:27:15,816 --> 01:27:17,400
we knew each other from somewhere

1068
01:27:17,692 --> 01:27:19,152
but we couldn't place where.

1069
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:27,202
But the second we saw each other, 
that very second...

You start telling him a story like that.

None of it's true, Martin.

He's had this weird, sick idea for years.

He's a bit nuts.

She's a little embarrassed about
the whole thing.

You can't blame her, really.

-Hand me a glass, please. 
-You heard that, huh?

01:28:37,188 --> 01:28:39,441
Oh, yeah, I heard it.

1089
01:28:39,733 --> 01:28:41,818
I heard it, every word of it,

1090
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:44,112
and I followed it very carefully.

1091
01:28:44,404 --> 01:28:46,990
He's told me the same story a thousand times

1092
01:28:47,282 --> 01:28:49,826
and it always changes. Always.

1093
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:53,204
[Eddie] I never, ever repeat myself.

1094
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:55,165
You do nothing but repeat yourself.

1095
01:28:55,457 --> 01:28:57,792
That's all you do. 
You go around in one big circle.

1096
01:28:58,084 --> 01:28:59,419
Round and round.

1097
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:00,670
Did you think it was a story, Martin?

1098
01:29:00,962 --> 01:29:03,006
Did you think I made that whole thing up?

1099
01:29:03,298 --> 01:29:06,885
At the time you were telling it, 
it seemed real.

1100
01:29:07,177 --> 01:29:10,263
But now you're doubting it because she
says it's a lie?

1101
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:11,640
She suggests it's a lie

1102
01:29:11,932 --> 01:29:13,767
and, all of a sudden, you change your mind?

1103
01:29:14,059 --> 01:29:16,311
You go from true to false like 
that in a second? Huh?

1104
01:29:16,603 --> 01:29:17,437
Come on. Let's go to the movies.

1105
01:29:17,729 --> 01:29:19,606
Nobody is going to the movies.

1106
01:29:20,899 --> 01:29:23,193
There's not a movie in a hundred miles

1107
01:29:23,485 --> 01:29:24,653
that can match the story I'm gonna tell.

1108
01:29:24,945 --> 01:29:26,363
I'm gonna finish this story, okay?

1109
01:29:26,655 --> 01:29:27,530
[May] Eddie

1110
01:29:29,074 --> 01:29:31,242
You want to hear the rest of the story, 
don't you, Marty?

1111
01:29:31,534 --> 01:29:32,535
Sure, yeah.

1112
01:29:32,827 --> 01:29:34,663
Okay, good.

1113
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:39,334
[Old Man] I'm dying to hear it myself.

1114
01:29:40,752 --> 01:29:41,586
Yeah.

1115
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:44,589
[May] You think this is gonna change something?

1116
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:45,840
No.

1117
01:29:48,343 --> 01:29:49,552
Then what's the point?

1118
01:29:49,844 --> 01:29:52,180
It's absolutely pointless.

1119
01:29:55,058 --> 01:29:56,768
Why put everybody through this?

1120
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,896
Martin don't wanna hear 
this bullshit and neither do I.

1121
01:30:00,188 --> 01:30:01,982
I know you don't wanna hear it.

1122
01:30:05,527 --> 01:30:08,113
Don't try and pass it off on me, Eddie.

1123
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,158
You got it turned around.

1124
01:30:14,294 --> 01:30:16,129
You got it all turned around.

1125
01:30:17,339 --> 01:30:20,050
You don't even know which end is up any more.

1126
01:30:28,183 --> 01:30:30,101
I don't need either of you.

1127
01:30:31,353 --> 01:30:33,230
I don't need any of it.

1128
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:38,193
Cause I know the whole rest of the story.

1129
01:30:38,485 --> 01:30:40,821
I know exactly how it happened.

1130
01:30:41,112 --> 01:30:44,157
Without adding any little tricks onto it, Eddie.

1131
01:30:44,449 --> 01:30:47,160
-What does she know? 
-She's lying.

1132
01:30:52,123 --> 01:30:56,086
Want me to finish it for you, Eddie? Huh?

1133
01:30:56,378 --> 01:30:59,047
[May] Want me to finish the story for you, 
Eddie?

1134
01:31:07,597 --> 01:31:10,392
See, my mother...

1135
01:31:11,268 --> 01:31:12,227
May?

1136
01:31:12,519 --> 01:31:17,023
[May] My momma, the pretty red-haired lady.

1137
01:31:19,943 --> 01:31:21,862
She was. She was...

1138
01:31:24,823 --> 01:31:27,617
She was desperately in love with the old man.

1139
01:31:29,452 --> 01:31:33,290
Wasn't she, Eddie? You could see it in her eyes.

1140
01:31:33,582 --> 01:31:34,916
She was so obsessed with him

1141
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:39,421
that she couldn't stand to be without him.

1142
01:31:40,881 --> 01:31:41,965
Even for a second.

1143
01:31:44,426 --> 01:31:48,138
So she kept hunting for him from town to town.

1144
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:50,432
And following little clues he'd leave behind,

1145
01:31:50,724 --> 01:31:55,020
like a postcard, a motel matchbook.

1146
01:31:57,063 --> 01:31:59,232
He didn't ever leave anything simple behind.

1147
01:31:59,524 --> 01:32:02,944
like a telephone number

1148
01:32:03,528 --> 01:32:05,113
or an address.

1149
01:32:06,781 --> 01:32:09,868
Because, you see, my mom was his little secret.

1150
01:32:11,953 --> 01:32:13,622
She hounded him.

1151
01:32:15,123 --> 01:32:17,250
Hounded him for years and years.

1152
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:28,094
And he just kept trying to keep her at a distance.

1153
01:32:30,805 --> 01:32:34,726
Cause, see, the closer these two separate lives,

1154
01:32:36,728 --> 01:32:38,855
these two separate kids,

1155
01:32:40,148 --> 01:32:43,485
these two separate women got together,

1156
01:32:45,946 --> 01:32:48,114
the more nervous he got.

1157
01:32:50,867 --> 01:32:53,662
And the more filled with terror

1158
01:32:55,747 --> 01:33:00,085
that these two lives would find
out about each other

1159
01:33:01,419 --> 01:33:04,339
and his little secret would devour him whole,

1160
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,176
just take him by the throat.

1161
01:33:13,473 --> 01:33:16,101
She finally caught up with him.

1162
01:33:17,102 --> 01:33:19,270
She just dulled him down.

1163
01:33:21,272 --> 01:33:25,443
I remember that day when we got to that town

1164
01:33:25,735 --> 01:33:27,487
and she kept saying...

1165
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:30,281
She was on fire, she was crazy. She kept saying

1166
01:33:30,573 --> 01:33:31,825
"This is it.

1167
01:33:32,117 --> 01:33:35,036
This is the place, May. This is the place."

1168
01:33:36,204 --> 01:33:39,207
And her whole body was trembling like this

1169
01:33:39,499 --> 01:33:43,003
as we were walking through the streets looking
for this house.

1170
01:33:44,587 --> 01:33:48,842
I remember she was holding my hand so tight,

1171
01:33:49,134 --> 01:33:52,095
I thought she was gonna crush all the bones
in my fingers.

1172
01:33:54,347 --> 01:33:57,183
She was so terrified.

1173
01:33:57,475 --> 01:34:01,021
She was so terrified she was gonna run
into him by accident.

1174
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:04,024
Because she knew she was trespassing.

1175
01:34:06,609 --> 01:34:11,531
She knew she was crossing into
the forbidden zone.

1176
01:34:18,121 --> 01:34:20,081
But she couldn't help herself.

1177
01:34:33,428 --> 01:34:37,390
So we walked all day in that stupid hick town.

1178
01:34:38,558 --> 01:34:40,518
All day.

1179
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:44,981
Going up and down every street in all
these neighborhoods,

1180
01:34:46,483 --> 01:34:49,486
looking in on every dumb family,

1181
01:34:49,778 --> 01:34:52,405
peering through all these open windows.

1182
01:34:53,698 --> 01:34:57,243
I remember it was exactly supper time

1183
01:34:57,535 --> 01:34:59,162
'cause everybody was sitting around the table

1184
01:34:59,454 --> 01:35:00,914
and they were having fried chicken.

1185
01:35:01,206 --> 01:35:02,832
That's how close we were to the window.

1186
01:35:03,124 --> 01:35:05,001
We could see what they were eating.

1187
01:35:05,293 --> 01:35:06,211
We could hear the voices

1188
01:35:06,503 --> 01:35:09,380
but we couldn't make out what they were saying.

1189
01:35:09,672 --> 01:35:11,758
But Eddie and his momma were talking

1190
01:35:13,176 --> 01:35:16,721
and the old man, he just sat there.

1191
01:35:17,013 --> 01:35:17,972
He didn't say nothing.

1192
01:35:18,556 --> 01:35:19,682
Did he, Eddie?

1193
01:35:21,309 --> 01:35:25,438
He just sat there in silence, 
eating his fried chicken.

1194
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,940
Is she ever off the wall with this one.

1195
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,733
You gotta do something about this.

1196
01:35:36,157 --> 01:35:41,079
The funny thing was, almost as soon
as we found him,

1197
01:35:41,371 --> 01:35:42,747
he disappeared.

1198
01:35:46,042 --> 01:35:48,628
She wasn't with him but a couple of weeks.

1199
01:35:49,712 --> 01:35:52,507
He just vanished.

1200
01:35:55,927 --> 01:35:59,264
Nobody ever saw him after that, ever.

1201
01:36:05,895 --> 01:36:09,816
And Momma, she just turned herself inside out.

1202
01:36:11,568 --> 01:36:13,736
I couldn't understand it

1203
01:36:14,028 --> 01:36:17,949
cause she grieved like somebody had died
or something.

1204
01:36:18,241 --> 01:36:20,660
I just couldn't understand that.

1205
01:36:21,703 --> 01:36:24,706
Cause I was feeling just the opposite.

1206
01:36:29,043 --> 01:36:31,004
See, I...

1207
01:36:34,424 --> 01:36:36,384
I was in love.

1208
01:36:42,557 --> 01:36:47,520
I remember I'd come home from school
after being with Eddie,

1209
01:36:49,272 --> 01:36:52,400
and I was filled with this joy that...

1210
01:36:59,824 --> 01:37:02,368
And there she'd be.

1211
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,662
She'd be standing in the kitchen

1212
01:37:04,954 --> 01:37:07,081
just staring at the sink.

1213
01:37:08,833 --> 01:37:10,960
And her eyes looked like a funeral.

1214
01:37:11,252 --> 01:37:12,295
I didn't know what to say to her.

1215
01:37:12,587 --> 01:37:14,923
I didn't even feel sorry for her.

1216
01:37:16,591 --> 01:37:19,219
Cause all I could think of was him.

1217
01:37:21,387 --> 01:37:24,140
And all he could think about was me.

1218
01:37:24,432 --> 01:37:26,142
Isn't that right, Eddie?

1219
01:37:29,103 --> 01:37:32,023
We couldn't take a breath without thinking
of each other.

1220
01:37:33,483 --> 01:37:36,986
We couldn't eat, couldn't sleep unless
we were together.

1221
01:37:38,446 --> 01:37:41,866
Eddie's mom didn't know what was wrong
with him.

1222
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:46,079
But my momma...

1223
01:37:48,414 --> 01:37:50,250
My momma knew exactly.

1224
01:37:52,961 --> 01:37:55,338
Right down to her bones.

1225
01:37:56,714 --> 01:38:01,302
She went to Eddie and she begged him
not to see me.

1226
01:38:06,266 --> 01:38:10,228
She went to Eddie's mom and begged her.

1227
01:38:17,986 --> 01:38:19,904
But Eddie's mother...

1228
01:38:24,325 --> 01:38:27,495
Eddie's mother blew her brains out, 
didn't she, Eddie?

1229
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,581
She blew her brains right out.

1230
01:38:36,212 --> 01:38:40,300
Now, wait a second. 
Just a goddamn second here.

1231
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:42,427
This story doesn't hold water.

1232
01:38:44,387 --> 01:38:45,596
You ain't gonna let her off the hook

1233
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,764
with that one, are you?

1234
01:38:48,057 --> 01:38:51,144
That's the dumbest version I ever heard
in my whole life.

1235
01:38:52,437 --> 01:38:56,482
She never blew her brains out. 
Nobody ever told me that.

1236
01:38:57,817 --> 01:39:00,194
Where in the hell did that come from?

1237
01:39:02,822 --> 01:39:03,906
Well?

1238
01:39:04,991 --> 01:39:06,492
Well, stand up.

1239
01:39:08,244 --> 01:39:10,038
Get on your feet now, goddammit!

1240
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:12,623
I wanna hear the male side of this thing!

1241
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:14,834
You're gonna represent me now.

1242
01:39:15,126 --> 01:39:16,627
You're gonna speak on my behalf.

1243
01:39:16,919 --> 01:39:18,880
There's nobody to speak for me now.

1244
01:39:20,089 --> 01:39:21,341
Get up.

1245
01:39:22,925 --> 01:39:24,427
Well, tell her, then.

1246
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,304
Tell her what really happened.

1247
01:39:27,347 --> 01:39:28,848
[gunshot]

1248
01:39:37,273 --> 01:39:39,233
It was your shotgun.

1249
01:39:47,575 --> 01:39:49,786
Same one we used to duck-hunt with.

1250
01:39:51,162 --> 01:39:52,872
Browning.

1251
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:58,086
She'd never fired a gun in her whole life.

1252
01:39:59,462 --> 01:40:00,797
[gunshot]

1253
01:40:03,883 --> 01:40:05,843
That was her first time.

1254
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:16,854
Nobody ever told me that.

1255
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:21,275
I was left completely in the dark on that one.

1256
01:40:22,026 --> 01:40:23,528
You were gone.

1257
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,530
I was gone but somebody could have found me.

1258
01:40:25,822 --> 01:40:28,783
They could have hunted me down. 
I wasn't impossible to find.

1259
01:40:29,075 --> 01:40:30,076
You were gone.

1260
01:40:30,368 --> 01:40:33,746
Gone? I know I was gone, God damn you!

1261
01:40:35,415 --> 01:40:37,375
I was gone!

1262
01:40:38,626 --> 01:40:41,796
But I wasn't disconnected.

1263
01:40:42,088 --> 01:40:44,966
There was nothing cutoff in me. 
Don't you forget that.

1264
01:40:45,258 --> 01:40:48,052
Everything went on just the same
as it did before I left.

1265
01:40:48,344 --> 01:40:49,887
Nothing changed.

1266
01:40:57,311 --> 01:40:59,439
But your mother...

1267
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:02,108
Your mother wouldn't give it up, would she?

1268
01:41:03,151 --> 01:41:04,735
She drew me to her.

1269
01:41:05,027 --> 01:41:07,196
She went out of her way to draw me in.

1270
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:09,198
She was a force.

1271
01:41:10,741 --> 01:41:12,577
I told her I'd never come across for her.

1272
01:41:12,869 --> 01:41:14,579
I told her that from the very beginning.

1273
01:41:14,871 --> 01:41:16,998
But she kept opening up to me.

1274
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:18,082
She kept...

1275
01:41:26,466 --> 01:41:28,009
See, she...

1276
01:41:29,677 --> 01:41:33,890
[stammering] She kept opening up her heart
to me, see.

1277
01:41:34,182 --> 01:41:36,392
You know, how could I turn her down

1278
01:41:36,684 --> 01:41:39,479
when she loved me like that?

1279
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:42,106
How could I turn away from her?

1280
01:41:42,398 --> 01:41:45,193
We were completely whole.

1281
01:41:47,653 --> 01:41:48,946
What are you doing?

1282
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:54,744
Speak to her! Bring her round to our side.

1283
01:41:55,036 --> 01:41:57,205
Make her see this thing in a clear light!

1284
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,876
Stay away from her, now.

1285
01:42:02,168 --> 01:42:05,463
What the hell are you doing? 
Keep away from her!

1286
01:42:05,755 --> 01:42:08,341
You two can't come together.

1287
01:42:08,633 --> 01:42:10,635
You gotta hold up my end of this deal.

1288
01:42:10,927 --> 01:42:12,845
I got nobody now.

1289
01:42:13,137 --> 01:42:14,972
You can't betray me now.

1290
01:42:17,934 --> 01:42:19,477
You're my son.

1291
01:42:40,414 --> 01:42:43,251
I ain't staying. I ain't.

Wait a minute, May. May?

Do you need some help or anything?

01:43:46,564 --> 01:43:49,233
I got a truck. 
I can drive you anywhere you wanna go.

[Martin] Where are you going?

01:44:07,084 --> 01:44:08,544
May?

1305
01:44:11,297 --> 01:44:14,050
You're not going with him, are you?

1306
01:44:14,467 --> 01:44:15,718
He's gone.

1307
01:44:18,262 --> 01:44:19,180
May?
