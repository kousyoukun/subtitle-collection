00:02:49,355 --> 00:02:51,789
# Listen to me, woman

2
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,395
# Listen to me

3
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:56,313
# I want you to understand

4
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,825
... country KAFH...

5
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:27,996
# Come on, baby, let's ride

6
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:37,192
# I can hear the sound
of your headlights on the ground

7
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,434
# Looking for me

8
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:47,313
-  It's 70 degrees...
- # Make new plans for the kitchen too...

9
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:52,072
# Make me smell the sweat

10
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:57,831
# On the red leather seat...

11
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,076
# Come on, baby, let's ride

12
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,030
# Come on, baby, let's ride

13
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,708
# Slide on into your four-wheel drive

14
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,553
# Let's ride

15
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,675
# Let me feel you moving with the moon

16
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,079
# Like the storming desert rain

17
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,672
# Come on, baby, let's ride

18
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:40,598
# Let me see the eyes that you hide

19
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,509
# Under your hair

20
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:50,715
# Come on, baby, let's ride

21
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:55,000
# Come on, baby, let's ride

22
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:58,593
# Slide on into your four-wheel drive

23
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,199
# Let's ride

24
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,673
# Let's ride

25
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:09,119
# Let's ride

26
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,881
# Let's ride

27
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:48,198
# Listen to me, woman

28
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:49,758
# Listen to me

29
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:52,240
# I want you to understand

30
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,524
Mr Valdes? I'm locking up.

31
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:59,285
I'll put the laundry in your car.

32
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:28,039
# Come on, baby, let's ride

33
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,964
# Come on, baby, let's ride

34
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:36,524
# Slide on into your four-wheel drive

35
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:40,317
# Let's ride

36
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,165
# Let's ride

37
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:46,884
# Let's ride

38
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:50,677
# Let's ride

39
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,490
Hey! Anybody?

40
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:25,019
Move.

41
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,100
Move!

42
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:52,695
You gonna do the laundry now?

43
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:59,900
- You don't have to do the laundry for me.
- How'd you find me?

44
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:02,539
I saw the old Chevy layin' tits-up out there.

45
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:05,863
I figured you died in a car crash
or you settled in for a while.

46
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:09,023
- Wouldn't make much difference to you.
- What's that?

47
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,102
If I died in some car crash.

48
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:17,297
I knew I shoulda had 'em burn
that damn thing. Or bury it.

49
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:22,626
You'd have gone right past
if it hadn't been for that car, right?

50
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,942
I'd have found you one way or the other.

51
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:34,385
Eddie.

52
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:40,304
You want me
to take those sheets for you?

53
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,340
I've been doin' my own laundry
for months now.

54
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:46,107
I'm real good at it.

55
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:49,186
You just plunk the old quarters in
and let it rip.

56
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,824
Come on, honey, let me do your laundry.

57
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:56,782
- You wanna do my laundry?
- Hey! Whoa, whoa!

58
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,820
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey! Whoa!

59
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,099
Do you do her laundry?

60
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,220
You want an aspirin or somethin', huh?

61
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,105
You got a headache?

62
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,106
You want some water?

63
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,861
May.

64
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:50,186
May, come on.

65
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:51,824
Honey?

66
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:57,470
You want me to make you
some hot tea or somethin'?

67
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:01,790
You want some tea?
I'll make you some tea like I used to, OK?

68
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:03,868
With lemon?

69
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:12,143
You want some Ovaltine? May...

70
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:16,822
May, you gotta let go of me now, OK?
Honey.

71
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:25,026
You want me to go, huh?

72
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:30,147
- What do you want, then?
- You smell.

73
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,988
Your fingers smell.

74
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:35,752
- Horses.
- Pussy.

75
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:39,264
- Oh, come on, May!
- They do. They smell like metal.

76
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,828
I am not gonna start this shit.

77
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:44,826
Rich pussy.

78
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:49,429
- Very clean pussy.
- I came to see if you were all right.

79
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,673
- I don't need you.
- Oh? OK. Good. Great.

80
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,555
What the hell are you doing in that truck?

81
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,586
- Eddie, don't go!
- Get outta here!

82
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:13,706
God damn... What kinda dump is this?

83
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:18,270
You live here?

84
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:34,867
What am I gonna do?
What am I supposed to do now?

85
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,873
What?

86
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:44,233
Oh, shit.

87
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:50,954
You're gonna erase me.

88
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:53,546
What are you talkin' about?

89
00:15:56,478 --> 00:16:00,711
You're gonna erase me. You're
gonna erase me or have me erased.

90
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:03,671
Why would I want... Are you crazy?

91
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,516
- Cos I'm in the way.
- Whoa, May.

92
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,790
- Don't talk like that.
- I am.

93
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,628
May, I am tryin' to take care of you,
all right?

94
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,512
Sure you are

95
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,278
Get back. Come on, back.

96
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,550
You're just guilty.

97
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,430
- You're gutless and you're guilty.
- That's real cute. Great. Gutless.

98
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,599
- What are you doing with these horses?
- I'm unloading them.

99
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,553
Haven't been out of this rig in 200 miles.

100
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,310
Even my horses
have to suffer because of you.

101
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,030
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Who?

102
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:50,832
- Who?
- Don't talk like that, will ya?

103
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:55,910
I am. I'm gonna kill her
and then I'm gonna kill you.

104
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,997
You're scaring me to death.

105
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:04,559
- Back up. Get back.
- Two very sharp knives.

106
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:08,436
Two separate knives.
One for you and one for her.

107
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,518
So the blood don't mix.

108
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:16,795
Do you know what I'm gonna do
to her first? I'm gonna torture her.

109
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:19,039
- Do you hear me?
- Uh-huh.

110
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,076
- I'm gonna torture her first.
- Oh, great.

111
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:28,837
- Not you. I'm gonna let you have it.
- Thanks.

112
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:30,919
That's right.

113
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:37,357
Probably in the midst of a kiss, after
you think everything's been healed up.

114
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:40,601
Right when you think
you've buffaloed me again.

115
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:43,963
That's right when you die.

116
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,640
You know how many miles I went
out of my way to come and see you?

117
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,404
- Nobody asked you to come here!
- 2,482.

118
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:56,404
- Where you been, Katmandu?
- 2,482 miles!

119
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,481
So what?

120
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,406
I missed you, you know.

121
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,206
I did.

122
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,370
More than anything
I ever missed in my whole life.

123
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,768
Kept thinkin' about you
the whole time I was driving.

124
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:44,847
I kept seeing you.

125
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:50,647
Sometimes just a part of you.

126
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,811
Yeah? Like which part?

127
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:59,367
- Your neck.
- My neck?

128
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,925
- Yeah.
- You missed my neck?

129
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:11,248
Yeah. Well, I missed all of you, but... your
neck kept comin' up for some reason.

130
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:13,932
- I kept cryin' about your neck.
- You were cryin'?

131
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:16,043
- Yeah.
- Crying?

132
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:17,607
Yeah.

133
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:22,611
Was this before or after
your fling with the countess?

134
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:26,203
There wasn't any fling with any countess.

135
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,642
- You're a liar.
- I took her to dinner once.

136
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:31,333
- You're a liar.
- OK, twice.

137
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:36,208
You were bumpin' on a regular basis.
Don't stand there and give me this shit.

138
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:48,891
- I'm takin' you back, May.
- Back to that idiot trailer? Oh, no.

139
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:53,724
No, I'm movin'. I got a piece of ground
up in Wyoming now.

140
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,811
- Wyoming?
- Yeah.

141
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,926
I'm not goin' to Wyoming.

142
00:20:58,054 --> 00:21:01,171
What's up there?
Marlboro Man or somethin'?

143
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:04,412
- Well, you can't stay here.
- Why not?

144
00:21:04,535 --> 00:21:08,005
Why not? I'm a regular citizen now.

145
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,365
And I got me a job.

146
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:16,374
You got a job?

147
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:19,692
That's right.
You think I'm helpless or somethin'?

148
00:21:19,816 --> 00:21:21,886
That's what you think, right?

149
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,689
- Yeah, it is.
- No, I just...

150
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,808
Been a long time since you had a job.

151
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,290
Well, I'm a cook.

152
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:39,257
A cook?
You can't even flip an egg, can you?

153
00:21:40,857 --> 00:21:43,530
- I'm not talkin' to you any more.
- May!

154
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:48,174
May! Goddammit!
Quit doin' this, will ya?

155
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:53,052
I got it all worked out now.
I been thinkin' about this for weeks.

156
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:58,457
I'll build a corral for the horses. We can
have a vegetable garden and chickens.

157
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:00,375
I hate chickens.

158
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,168
I hate horses
and I hate all that other shit too.

159
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:08,256
You have me confused
with somebody else, don't ya?

160
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:11,131
Unbelievable!

161
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,218
I'm not lettin' go of you this time, May.

162
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,536
You never had me to begin with, Eddie.

163
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,738
You keep comin' up with
this lame country dream,

164
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,169
life in the country,
vegetables and chickens and stuff.

165
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,532
I hate all that stuff.
It makes me puke to even think about it.

166
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:48,729
What do you think it's like sitting in a tin
trailer waiting for the butane to arrive?

167
00:22:48,861 --> 00:22:52,171
Then hiking down the Laundromat.
You think that's thrilling?

168
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,815
What?

169
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:18,416
- Get outta here, Eddie.

170
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:20,578
Turn off this goddamn thing.

171
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:25,015
Don't touch me.
Now get outta here. Dammit.

172
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:34,619
Couldn't you just stay put?
I told you I was comin' back to get you.

173
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:38,213
I bought you all them magazines.
I thought you liked that.

174
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:41,494
- Those French kinds.
- Oh, God.

175
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:44,900
Yeah. I did. You're right.

176
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,935
I especially liked the one
with the countess on the cover.

177
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:50,703
That was real cute.

178
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,499
I liked that one a lot.

179
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:02,575
All right.

180
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:05,299
All right what?

181
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:15,063
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm gonna sleep in the truck.

182
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:29,019
- You're gonna spend the night?
- I'll be gone in the morning.

183
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:35,620
# He was branded by the Wyoming wind

184
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:40,377
# He belongs to her until he dies

185
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:43,704
No. Wait.

186
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:48,304
#... from the Laramie river

187
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:54,697
# And his heartbeat's Cheyenne

188
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:59,948
# Why, oh, Wyoming

189
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:06,546
# You make me wonder why

190
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:13,299
# Why, oh, Wyoming

191
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:18,819
# Why?

192
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:48,305
# She liked the crowds

193
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,866
# He looked up in the clouds

194
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,985
# So they never saw eye to eye

195
00:25:57,631 --> 00:26:01,340
# She had her magazine dreams

196
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:04,269
# Of faraway scenes

197
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:11,184
# And he had the Wyoming sky

198
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:16,147
# Why, oh, Wyoming

199
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:21,864
# You make me wonder why

200
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:29,471
# Why, oh, Wyoming

201
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:35,705
# Why?

202
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:41,992
# Why, oh, Wyoming

203
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:49,143
# You make me wonder why

204
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,984
# Why, oh, Wyoming

205
00:26:55,355 --> 00:27:01,749
# Why?

206
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:07,267
# Why, oh, Wyoming

207
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:14,703
# You make me wonder why

208
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:19,785
# Why, oh, Wyoming

209
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:25,990
# Why?

210
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:47,512
You can take it.
You're a stunt man. Right?

211
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,397
- You got any tequila?
- You already drank my tequila!

212
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,319
- Come on, I wanna show you somethin'.
- I'm in the middle of somethin' here.

213
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,831
- I'm tryin' to talk to somebody.
- Show you something.

214
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,599
Look at that.

215
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,677
Remember that?

216
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:58,350
- Where'd you get this?

217
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:03,030
Take a look at that picture over there.

218
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:06,756
- You know who that is?
- I'm not sure.

219
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:13,151
It's Barbara Mandrell.

220
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:17,595
That's who that is. Barbara Mandrell.

221
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,838
You heard of her?

222
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,915
Yeah, sure.

223
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:27,633
Would you believe me
if I told you I was married to her?

224
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:29,719
- No.
- Uh-huh.

225
00:29:29,842 --> 00:29:32,721
You see, that's the difference right there.

226
00:29:33,163 --> 00:29:36,871
I'm actually married to Barbara Mandrell
in my mind.

227
00:29:37,003 --> 00:29:39,676
Can you understand that?

228
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:43,159
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, good.

229
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,478
I'm glad we have an understanding.

230
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:42,117
I swear to God
I didn't hate you even more.

231
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:49,401
It just grows. Just grows and grows.

232
00:30:49,527 --> 00:30:54,123
But I mean to see you no more.
See you no more.

233
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:57,319
Just to see a picture of you.
No, not just you.

234
00:30:57,448 --> 00:31:00,804
I've seen a picture of you and her,
that bitch.

235
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:35,442
I don't understand how I could hate you
so much after so much time.

236
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:40,162
I don't remember
how much I'd like to hate you.

237
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:43,521
I hate you even more. That's right.

238
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,087
I hate you even more
and all it does is just grow.

239
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,000
If I see you in the morning...

240
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,599
See a picture of you...

241
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,965
Of you and that bitch.

242
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:08,445
I don't care.

243
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:20,367
It just invades my head.

244
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:24,602
It invades my head all the time.

245
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:28,487
Bet you love that, don't you?

246
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:36,728
This picture stings me more
than seeing you with her.

247
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,363
It stings me more.

248
00:32:42,534 --> 00:32:45,411
And it cuts me. Always cuts me.

249
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,169
Cuts me up.

250
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:52,609
Cuts me...

251
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:55,406
And he kinda just comes...

252
00:32:55,534 --> 00:33:00,085
Uninvited, like.

253
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,207
Right when I don't expect it.
Like a little torture.

254
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:08,530
Like a little torture.

255
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,611
I blame you more. I do.

256
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:16,526
I blame you more for this torture
than I actually do for what you did.

257
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,444
If you love her, I could kill you.

258
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:23,805
If I really wanted to, I could.

259
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:26,325
I don't care
that much about you to kill you.

260
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,809
You forgot your sweater.

261
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,968
You better go.
It's better that you go right now.

262
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:48,693
- I wish you'd make up your mind...
- I got somebody comin' here to get me.

263
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:50,773
Here?

264
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:54,287
Yeah, here.
Where you think they're gonna go?

265
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:57,250
- Who you been seein'?
- Don't you come near me!

266
00:33:57,377 --> 00:33:59,811
Don't you even think about it.

267
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,729
This time... Makes me so sick...

268
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,173
# Low down leaving sun, I've done

269
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,418
# Did everything that needs done

270
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,216
# But woe is me

271
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:03,332
# Why can't I see?

272
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:07,773
# I'd best be leaving well enough alone

273
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:09,857
# Them neon light nights

274
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,336
# Couldn't stay out of fights

275
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:16,340
# Keep a-haunting me in memories

276
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:18,692
# Well, there's one in every crowd

277
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:21,051
# For crying out loud

278
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:24,776
# Why was it always turning out to be me?

279
00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:27,618
# Where does it go?

280
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:29,699
# The good Lord only knows

281
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:32,860
# Seems like it was just the other day

282
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:36,058
# I was down at Green Gables

283
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:38,377
# A-hawking them tables

284
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:42,098
# And generally blowing
all my hard-earned pay

285
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:44,979
# Piano rolled blues

286
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:47,173
# Danced holes in my shoes

287
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:51,502
# There weren't another other way to be

288
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:55,821
# For lovable losers, no-account boozers

289
00:35:55,944 --> 00:36:00,256
# And honky tonk heroes like me

290
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,579
Hey, hey.

291
00:36:07,824 --> 00:36:09,940
# Where does it go?

292
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:12,056
# The good Lord only knows

293
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:15,938
# Seems like it was just the other day

294
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,581
You got any glasses?

295
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,940
They're in the bathroom.

296
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:40,297
- What they doing in the bathroom?
- I keep everything there.

297
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:43,816
- It's safer.
- Where are the damn glasses?

298
00:36:43,947 --> 00:36:47,178
- In the medicine cabinet.
- What are they doing there?

299
00:36:48,347 --> 00:36:51,896
There are no germs
in the medicine cabinet.

300
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:54,700
Oh, germs. Germs.

301
00:36:54,827 --> 00:36:57,216
Germs.

302
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,542
- Germs.
- That's right.

303
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,624
Do you want some of this?

304
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:04,263
No. I'm on the wagon.

305
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:08,504
- Good. It's about time.

306
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:47,899
-  I have returned.

307
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:19,461
- Wait a minute. I'm not that kind of a guy.
- Oh, you know you are.

308
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:28,345
Not on the first date.

309
00:38:36,872 --> 00:38:40,263
# With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin

310
00:38:40,393 --> 00:38:43,510
# And a rose of a different name

311
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,429
# The devil made me do it the first time

312
00:38:48,553 --> 00:38:51,751
# The second time I done it on my own

313
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:55,071
# Lord, put a handle
on a simple-handed man

314
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:58,550
# And help him leave that black rose alone

315
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:18,226
# When the devil made that woman

316
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:21,586
# Lord, he threw the pattern away

317
00:39:21,715 --> 00:39:24,866
# She was built for speed
with the tools you need

318
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,192
# To make a new fool every day

319
00:39:30,555 --> 00:39:33,228
# Way down deep and dirty

320
00:39:33,356 --> 00:39:36,428
# On the darker side of shame

321
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:40,185
# I caught a cane-cutting man
and a bottle of gin

322
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:43,388
# With a rose of a different name

323
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,667
# The devil made me do it the first time

324
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:52,187
# The second time I done it on my own

325
00:39:52,316 --> 00:39:55,115
# Lord, put a handle
on a simple-handed man

326
00:39:55,237 --> 00:39:58,388
# And help him leave that black rose alone

327
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,627
# The devil made me do it the first time

328
00:40:03,757 --> 00:40:06,510
# The second time I done it on my own

329
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,115
# Lord, put a handle
on a simple-handed man

330
00:40:10,238 --> 00:40:13,708
# And help him leave that black rose alone

331
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:30,271
- What are you gonna do with that?
- Clean it.

332
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,556
Eddie, this is a very friendly person
comin' here.

333
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,716
He's not malicious in any way.

334
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:47,351
- Did you hear what I said?
- About what?

335
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,274
- About the man who's comin' here.
- What man?

336
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,791
First off, it can't be very serious.

337
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:05,836
- Oh, really? And why is that?
- Cos you call him a man.

338
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:11,635
- What am I supposed to call him?
- A guy.

339
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,116
If you called him a guy, I'd be worried.

340
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:17,233
Since you call him a man,
you give yourself away.

341
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:21,593
You're in a dumb situation with this guy
by callin' him a man.

342
00:41:21,722 --> 00:41:27,194
- You put yourself below him.
- What the hell do you know about it?

343
00:41:27,322 --> 00:41:32,077
Anybody who don't kill himself
by fallin' off horses and ridin' steers

344
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:35,478
- is a twerp in your book, isn't that right?
- Yeah, that is right.

345
00:41:35,602 --> 00:41:37,833
What are you supposed to call yourself?

346
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:41,591
You supposed to call yourself a guy
or call yourself a man?

347
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:44,873
If you ain't a cowboy, you ain't shit.

348
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,837
- Why's everything a contest with you?

349
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:51,761
He's not competing with you.
He doesn't know you exist.

350
00:41:51,883 --> 00:41:55,592
- You can introduce me.
- You can't keep messing me around.

351
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:59,797
You have no right to be jealous of me.
Not after all the bullshit I've been through.

352
00:41:59,924 --> 00:42:05,282
- We got a pact. Remember that?
- We haven't got anything any more.

353
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:08,476
Is that right?
How come you're so excited?

354
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:13,553
- I'm not excited!
- Yeah, you are. You're beside yourself.

355
00:42:13,685 --> 00:42:16,563
You're drivin' me crazy, that's why.

356
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:19,152
You know we're connected, May.

357
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:23,995
We'll always be connected.
That was decided a long time ago.

358
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,878
Nothing was decided, Eddie.
You screwed up.

359
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:31,283
- You know what happened.
- You promised me that.

360
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:34,125
You promised
you'd never bring that up again.

361
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:36,885
A promise can't stop that. It happened.

362
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:40,681
- Nothing happened, Eddie!
- Innocent to the last drop.

363
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:42,762
Nothing happened!

364
00:42:42,886 --> 00:42:46,845
- You're a traitor.
- Eddie, nothing ever happened!

365
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:50,042
Eddie!

366
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:54,963
Eddie!

367
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:30,447
Baby?

368
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,930
You know something, honey?

369
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:45,012
There is one thing I'll never forget.

370
00:45:46,696 --> 00:45:48,766
I'll never forget this as long as I live.

371
00:45:52,656 --> 00:45:56,969
I don't even know
why I remember it exactly.

372
00:45:57,097 --> 00:46:01,170
But you and me and your mother

373
00:46:02,297 --> 00:46:07,815
were drivin' through southern Utah once,
I think it was,

374
00:46:08,377 --> 00:46:10,333
in that old Plymouth we had.

375
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:16,207
You remember that Plym?
It had a white plastic hood.

376
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:19,535
A replica of the Mayflower, I think it was.

377
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:41,452
Well, it was some kind of ship.

378
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,457
Anyway, we'd been drivin' all night

379
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,414
and you were sound asleep
in the back seat

380
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,532
and your momma was sound asleep
in the front.

381
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:56,609
# You lied your way right into my heart

382
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:01,973
# Said all those things
I thought I'd never hear

383
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:06,173
# You held my hand
when we went out walking

384
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,657
Then all of a sudden you woke up crying.

385
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,935
Just busting a gut over something.
I don't know what it was.

386
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:17,939
A nightmare or something.

387
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:22,331
Woke your momma right up.

388
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,413
She climbed over the seat
there in the back with you

389
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:44,976
to try to get you settled down.

390
00:47:47,182 --> 00:47:50,811
But you just kept wailing.
Wouldn't shut up for hell nor high water.

391
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,817
So I stopped the Plymouth
by the side of the road,

392
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:58,333
middle of nowhere.

393
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:08,736
Can't even remember
where it was exactly.

394
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:10,934
Pitch-black.

395
00:48:28,064 --> 00:48:34,061
And I picked you up out of the back seat
there and carried you out into this field.

396
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,624
Thought the cold air
might quiet you down.

397
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:41,338
But you just kept howling.

398
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:47,661
And all of a sudden
I saw something move out there.

399
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:51,744
Something bigger
than both of us put together.

400
00:48:53,706 --> 00:48:57,620
And it started to move toward us,
kinda slow.

401
00:48:57,746 --> 00:49:03,265
And then it started to get joined up
by some other things just like it.

402
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:05,776
Same shape and everything.

403
00:49:07,787 --> 00:49:13,020
But these things started
to kind of move in on us.

404
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:20,378
I looked back at the car
to see if your mother was all right

405
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:26,025
and just then these things started to moo.

406
00:49:29,388 --> 00:49:31,344
They all started mooing away.

407
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,666
- The cows?

408
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:46,899
Sure enough, there we were standing
in the middle of a goddamn herd of cattle.

409
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:51,339
You never heard a baby
pipe down so fast.

410
00:50:06,391 --> 00:50:12,387
You just never made a peep after that
the whole rest of the trip.

411
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:20,899
You got any gin in there?

412
00:51:28,915 --> 00:51:30,870
# Rosa

413
00:51:31,915 --> 00:51:35,146
# He told me about you

414
00:51:36,195 --> 00:51:40,746
# He said that you danced like the wind

415
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:43,993
# Go, Rosa, go

416
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:49,030
# Rosa

417
00:51:49,155 --> 00:51:53,513
# I came here to warn you

418
00:51:53,636 --> 00:51:58,232
# That hombre belongs to me

419
00:51:58,356 --> 00:52:01,189
# Go, Rosa, go

420
00:52:01,796 --> 00:52:04,152
# Rosa

421
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:08,474
# Stop looking that way at him

422
00:52:08,597 --> 00:52:13,193
# My patience is wearing thin

423
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:16,468
# Now you better go

424
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:20,990
# Go, Rosa, go

425
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:25,354
# Go back to Mexico

426
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:30,511
# You and I, we are strangers

427
00:52:30,638 --> 00:52:34,153
# But your life is in danger

428
00:52:36,478 --> 00:52:38,469
# Rosa

429
00:52:39,518 --> 00:52:43,353
# Your eyes are as black as sin

430
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:47,188
# They're casting a spell on him

431
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,833
# No, Rosa, no

432
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:53,676
# Rosa

433
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:58,910
# Here north of the border

434
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,316
# When you take a man like that

435
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,035
# There's no law and order

436
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,594
# Rosa

437
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,190
# Stop looking that way at him

438
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,479
# My patience is wearing thin

439
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,832
# Now you better go

440
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:25,835
# Go, Rosa, go

441
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:31,077
# Go back to Mexico

442
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:35,549
# You and I, we are strangers

443
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:39,516
# But your life is in danger

444
00:54:42,325 --> 00:54:44,555
- Asshole.

445
00:55:03,446 --> 00:55:07,200
Oh, that cow got away?
Come on, boy.

446
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:51,679
Decided to jump off the wagon, huh?

447
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:55,085
Hm. Mm.

448
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:06,039
- What are you doing?
- Just a little practice.

449
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,880
Gotta stay in practice these days.

450
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:15,368
There's kids out there
ropin' cattle in six seconds dead.

451
00:56:15,491 --> 00:56:18,243
They got it down to a science.

452
00:56:18,371 --> 00:56:22,444
- I thought you were leaving.
- Yeah, I was gonna.

453
00:56:22,571 --> 00:56:25,722
But then I got
about ten miles down the road there

454
00:56:25,851 --> 00:56:30,641
and it suddenly occurred to me there
probably isn't any man comin' here at all.

455
00:56:30,771 --> 00:56:34,684
Probably isn't any guy
or any man or anybody.

456
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:38,920
You just made all that up.

457
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:48,770
- Why would I do that?
- Just to get even.

458
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:02,569
So that's how it is.

459
00:57:02,693 --> 00:57:05,924
Gonna get real mean and sloppy,
just like old times.

460
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:08,966
- Well...
- Like old times.

461
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:12,608
I haven't drunk in quite a while, honey.
I've been real good.

462
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:15,725
I figure I owe it to myself for once.

463
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:27,092
Have you balled him yet?

464
00:57:29,374 --> 00:57:31,331
Hm?

465
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:35,090
I'm just curious.

466
00:57:36,935 --> 00:57:40,530
You don't have to tell me.
I already know it.

467
00:57:47,136 --> 00:57:50,047
I hope this man comes over here.

468
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,565
I really hope he does.

469
00:57:52,696 --> 00:57:55,847
I wanna see him walk through that door.

470
00:57:59,136 --> 00:58:03,209
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna nail his ass to the floor.

471
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,452
Directly.

472
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,728
I'm not stickin' around for this.

473
00:58:13,817 --> 00:58:18,288
- Wait. Come on, take it easy.

474
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:21,853
Honey! I'll back off, OK? I'll be real nice.

475
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:24,889
I'll be just like a little old pussycat, OK?

476
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:29,170
You can introduce me to him
as your brother, OK?

477
00:58:30,898 --> 00:58:35,015
- OK? Maybe not your brother.
- Maybe not.

478
00:58:35,138 --> 00:58:37,698
Your cousin, OK?
I just wanna meet him.

479
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:41,936
- No! Why do you wanna meet him?
- You don't understand these things.

480
00:58:42,058 --> 00:58:44,857
You can tell a lot about a person
by the company they keep.

481
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:48,175
- No. I'm just gonna go in the office.
- Come on.

482
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:51,655
- We'll try and forget the whole thing.
- Good. OK.

483
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,656
Great.

484
00:58:58,979 --> 00:59:01,698
Uh-oh.

485
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:03,252
Great.

486
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,852
Why don't you run out there and throw
yourself into his arms or something?

487
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,097
- What are you gonna do?
- Put my hooks on.

488
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,973
I wanna look good,
give him the right impression.

489
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,251
- I'm your cousin, after all.
- I swear to God, if you hurt him...

490
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,770
- I'm not gonna hurt him.
- He's just an ordinary date.

491
00:59:21,901 --> 00:59:27,897
- I'm gonna turn him into a fig.
- Just this once, Eddie, do me a favour.

492
00:59:28,021 --> 00:59:31,252
Just one time.
Just this once, Eddie.

493
00:59:31,381 --> 00:59:34,054
Anything you want, honey.
Anything you want.

494
00:59:48,942 --> 00:59:52,491
What are you doing? May?

495
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:56,898
May, what are you doing? May?

496
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:01,377
- May?
- It's not him.

497
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:06,780
- It's not, uh?
- No, it's not.

498
01:00:07,423 --> 01:00:10,415
Oh, too bad. Who is it, then?

499
01:00:12,144 --> 01:00:14,737
Somebody else.

500
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:20,295
It's a big, huge, extra-Iong
black Mercedes Benz.

501
01:00:21,104 --> 01:00:23,698
This is a motel, isn't it?

502
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:26,258
Rich people have to sleep too.

503
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:31,339
This ain't a black Mercedes Benz
type of motel, Eddie.

504
01:00:33,184 --> 01:00:36,415
Somebody's just standin' out there
in front of that car.

505
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:39,013
Just standin' there lookin' at me.

506
01:00:40,865 --> 01:00:43,902
What are they doin'?

507
01:00:44,025 --> 01:00:47,575
I don't think it's a they, Eddie.
I think it's a she.

508
01:00:47,705 --> 01:00:49,822
May, get away from the door.

509
01:00:49,945 --> 01:00:52,824
Not that you know anybody
with a black Mercedes Benz...

510
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:55,301
Stay down.

511
01:00:55,426 --> 01:00:58,941
- Who the hell is that?
- How should I know? Stay there.

512
01:00:59,065 --> 01:01:01,660
It's OK.

513
01:01:07,466 --> 01:01:10,504
I don't know who she is.
Just stay there.

514
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:13,299
That is the kind of car a countess drives.

515
01:01:14,706 --> 01:01:17,937
You don't know her?
That's the kind of car a countess drives.

516
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:20,900
- Stay down!

517
01:01:22,547 --> 01:01:25,300
- You OK? Stay down.
- I'm down!

518
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:27,544
- How crazy is she?
- Pretty crazy.

519
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:30,501
- Just stay down.
- Have you balled her yet?

520
01:01:41,709 --> 01:01:45,384
She's blown the goddamn windshield
out of my truck!

521
01:01:45,509 --> 01:01:48,945
- She what?
- She's blown the windshield out.

522
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:53,497
- You should have thought of this!
- Where are you going? Wait a second.

523
01:01:53,629 --> 01:01:56,223
- Keep those lights off.
- Don't you tell me what to do!

524
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:58,738
She's gonna come back.
We gotta get outta here.

525
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:03,784
- We gotta get your stuff...
- Stop it! Don't you dare pick me up!

526
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:12,145
- Put me down!
- I came here to get you.

527
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:17,788
I came all this way to get you. Do you
think I'd do that for anybody else?

528
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:21,028
- Put me down!
- Listen to me!

529
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:25,622
The amazing thing is, neither one of you
look a bit familiar to me.

530
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,945
Can't figure that one out.

531
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:30,983
I don't recognise myself
in either one of you. Never have.

532
01:02:32,991 --> 01:02:36,108
Now get your stuff.
We're gettin' outta here.

533
01:02:36,231 --> 01:02:39,541
No, I'm not leavin',
but you're leavin' for sure!

534
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:44,504
- You broke my bed.
- I am not leavin' without you, May.

535
01:02:44,632 --> 01:02:47,669
If you're stayin' here, I'm stayin' here.

536
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:51,705
You'll never get rid of me. I'll track you
down, no matter where you go.

537
01:02:52,392 --> 01:02:54,781
I know exactly how your mind works.

538
01:02:54,912 --> 01:02:56,868
I've been right every time.

539
01:02:56,993 --> 01:03:01,270
- Every single time.
- You gotta give this up, Eddie.

540
01:03:01,393 --> 01:03:04,942
I don't know what's in your head
any more, I really don't.

541
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,906
Now you desperately need me?

542
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:10,467
Now you can't live without me?

543
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:14,631
Why should I believe you now?

544
01:03:15,674 --> 01:03:19,712
Cos it's true? Cos it was
supposed to be true every other time.

545
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:23,224
Every other time before this,
and it's true again.

546
01:03:23,354 --> 01:03:25,629
You've been jerkin' me off for 15 years.

547
01:03:25,754 --> 01:03:29,303
For 15 years I've been a yo-yo to you.

548
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,393
You know what?
I never been split either.

549
01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:38,272
I never thought one way or another about
it. I either loved you or I didn't love you.

550
01:03:38,395 --> 01:03:40,350
You know what, Eddie?

551
01:03:40,475 --> 01:03:43,308
Now I just plain don't love you.

552
01:03:44,275 --> 01:03:46,266
You understand?

553
01:03:46,395 --> 01:03:49,353
You hear me, Eddie?
You understand?

554
01:03:50,595 --> 01:03:55,874
I don't love you, I don't need you
and I don't want you.

555
01:03:55,996 --> 01:03:58,510
- You get it?
- Get in the bathroom.

556
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,595
I'm not gettin' in the bathroom!

557
01:04:01,716 --> 01:04:03,911
I'm not gonna hide in my own house!

558
01:04:04,036 --> 01:04:08,393
I'm gonna go out
and I'm gonna tear her damn hair off!

559
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:10,905
- May...
- I'm gonna whack her ass. That's right.

560
01:04:11,036 --> 01:04:15,075
Come on in here with your damn gun.
Bring all your weapons.

561
01:04:22,157 --> 01:04:24,432
Stop!

562
01:04:24,557 --> 01:04:26,991
No!

563
01:04:27,477 --> 01:04:30,549
Oh, no. It's all right. It's all right.

564
01:04:30,678 --> 01:04:34,670
It's all right. We were just
havin' an argument. It's OK.

565
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,233
It's OK. It's just a little argument, that's all.

566
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:40,474
Oh, God.

567
01:04:40,598 --> 01:04:44,069
I heard you screamin' when I drove up
and then all the lights went out.

568
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:47,827
- I thought someone was tryin' to...
- Oh.

569
01:04:47,959 --> 01:04:50,348
No, they weren't.

570
01:04:51,318 --> 01:04:54,994
I better turn my truck lights off.
The battery will run down.

571
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,155
Yeah, you better.

572
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:03,511
It sure looked like you was gettin'...
you know...

573
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:05,595
No, I wasn't.

574
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:07,836
-  That's him?
- I'm gonna kill you.

575
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:19,037
Oh, Martin, this is... this is my cousin.

576
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,230
Ed... die.

577
01:05:22,681 --> 01:05:25,877
- I'm sorry.
- She's lyin'.

578
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:30,237
- Oh?
- Oh, no. You wanna come on in?

579
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:34,070
- Have a drink. I bet you need one.
- Yeah.

580
01:05:34,801 --> 01:05:39,875
I'm gonna have to get you a...
wash you a glass, OK?

581
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:41,559
- Yeah.
- OK?

582
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,638
OK.

583
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,392
She keeps the glasses in the bathroom.
Isn't that weird?

584
01:05:52,722 --> 01:05:55,077
I was startin' to think
you weren't gonna come.

585
01:05:55,202 --> 01:06:00,230
I'm sorry. I had to water the football field
down at the high school.

586
01:06:00,362 --> 01:06:02,193
- Forgot all about it.
- You did?

587
01:06:02,323 --> 01:06:05,473
- Forgot all about what?
- I forgot about the waterin'.

588
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:08,992
I was halfway here when I remembered.

589
01:06:09,123 --> 01:06:13,241
- There you go.
- I thought you forgot about her.

590
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:15,399
Oh, no.

591
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:18,754
How far was halfway?

592
01:06:21,364 --> 01:06:23,319
Excuse me?

593
01:06:23,444 --> 01:06:26,356
How far was it
when you were halfway here?

594
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,362
I don't know.
I guess a couple of miles or so.

595
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:33,443
A couple of miles?
A couple of lousy, stinkin' miles?

596
01:06:33,564 --> 01:06:36,557
You wanna know how many miles
I came? You wanna know?

597
01:06:36,684 --> 01:06:41,361
- Huh?
- Agh! I'm so sorry.

598
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:45,444
It's OK. We've been drinkin' a little bit.

599
01:06:45,564 --> 01:06:47,317
She's in deep shit.

600
01:06:47,445 --> 01:06:49,800
I'm gonna kill you.

601
01:06:51,045 --> 01:06:53,400
What's the matter, May?

602
01:06:53,525 --> 01:06:56,403
What? Nothin'.

603
01:06:58,325 --> 01:07:01,158
How come you had all the lights off?

604
01:07:01,966 --> 01:07:05,163
Oh... Yeah, we were gonna go out.

605
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:08,517
- But you...
- And we were gonna come back.

606
01:07:08,646 --> 01:07:11,035
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

607
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:13,919
That's not what we were gonna do.

608
01:07:15,086 --> 01:07:18,761
That's not
what we were gonna do, Marty. No.

609
01:07:18,886 --> 01:07:23,165
We were actually
havin' a big argument about you.

610
01:07:25,367 --> 01:07:27,517
- About me?
- Uh-huh.

611
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:30,844
We were in the middle
of a big argument about you.

612
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:33,561
It got so heated up,
we had to turn the lights off.

613
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:39,199
- He's just joking.
- What was it about?

614
01:07:39,327 --> 01:07:45,325
It was about whether or not
you're actually a man or not.

615
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:50,156
Whether you're a man... or just a guy.

616
01:07:52,288 --> 01:07:56,407
See, she says that you're a man.
Did you know that?

617
01:07:56,529 --> 01:07:59,042
Did you know that's what she calls you?
A man.

618
01:07:59,169 --> 01:08:02,878
- I didn't know that.
- I didn't. Don't worry about it.

619
01:08:03,009 --> 01:08:05,000
It's OK. I don't mind it.

620
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,405
Didn't we say
we were goin' to the movies?

621
01:08:09,529 --> 01:08:11,646
Yeah. That's what I thought.

622
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:16,403
- We drink on up and we go, OK?

623
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,206
I'll be back.

624
01:08:28,931 --> 01:08:32,081
She's not mad or anything, is she?

625
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:34,247
I didn't mean to make her mad.

626
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:36,441
Huh.

627
01:08:52,972 --> 01:08:56,044
What are you gonna go see, Marty?

628
01:08:56,172 --> 01:08:58,322
I can't decide.

629
01:09:00,732 --> 01:09:05,363
What do you mean? Supposed to have
all that worked out, aren't you?

630
01:09:05,492 --> 01:09:08,246
Yeah, but I'm not sure what she likes.

631
01:09:08,372 --> 01:09:11,809
What difference does that make?
You're takin' her out, right?

632
01:09:11,932 --> 01:09:13,685
Yeah.

633
01:09:13,813 --> 01:09:17,283
You pick the movie.
The guy is supposed to pick the movie.

634
01:09:17,413 --> 01:09:20,564
The guy always picks the movie.

635
01:09:20,693 --> 01:09:24,811
Yeah, but I don't wanna take her
to somethin' she doesn't wanna see.

636
01:09:24,934 --> 01:09:27,494
How do you know
what she wants to see?

637
01:09:27,614 --> 01:09:31,732
- I don't. That's the reason I can't decide.
- Uh-huh.

638
01:09:31,854 --> 01:09:35,164
What if I take her
to somethin' she's seen before?

639
01:09:35,294 --> 01:09:37,888
No, you missed the whole point, Marty.

640
01:09:38,014 --> 01:09:40,892
The reason
you're takin' her out to the movies

641
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:45,167
isn't to see somethin'
that she hasn't seen before.

642
01:09:45,294 --> 01:09:47,251
- No?
- No.

643
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:49,889
The reason
you're takin' her out to the movies

644
01:09:50,015 --> 01:09:52,734
is you just wanna be with her, right?

645
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,973
You just wanna... be close to her, right?

646
01:10:00,016 --> 01:10:02,813
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.

647
01:10:02,935 --> 01:10:04,927
You could take her just about anywhere.

648
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:10,375
After a while you probably won't
even have to take her out at all.

649
01:10:10,496 --> 01:10:13,693
You can hang around here,
save yourself a lot of money.

650
01:10:13,816 --> 01:10:15,773
Yeah.

651
01:10:17,136 --> 01:10:20,094
- Oops.
- What'll we do here?

652
01:10:21,857 --> 01:10:27,727
Well, you could...
You could uh... tell each other stories.

653
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,415
- Stories?
- Yeah.

654
01:10:29,537 --> 01:10:32,097
- I don't know any stories.
- Well, make 'em up.

655
01:10:32,217 --> 01:10:37,736
- That'd be lyin', wouldn't it?
- No. Only when you believe it's true.

656
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:40,975
When you know it's a lie, it's not lyin'.

657
01:10:41,097 --> 01:10:45,137
- You want a hand up off the floor?
- No.

658
01:10:45,258 --> 01:10:47,852
I like it down here.
There's less tension.

659
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:50,936
You notice when you're standin' up
there's more tension?

660
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:55,654
Yeah. A lot of times when I'm workin'
I'm down on my hands and knees.

661
01:10:55,778 --> 01:10:59,169
- What line of work do you follow?
- Yard work, mostly.

662
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:04,327
Oh. You mean lawns and stuff?

663
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:08,849
- Maintenance.
- You do lawns on your hands and knees?

664
01:11:08,979 --> 01:11:12,938
- Edgin'. Trimmin' around the edges.
- Oh, yeah?

665
01:11:13,059 --> 01:11:16,655
- Weedin' around the sprinkler heads.
- I get you.

666
01:11:16,779 --> 01:11:20,409
Yeah, I always noticed
how much more relaxed I get

667
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:24,579
when I'm down on my hands and knees,
close to the ground.

668
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:29,330
You can get down on your hands
and knees right now. I don't mind.

669
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,336
- No, I'll stand, thanks.
- Suit yourself.

670
01:11:33,461 --> 01:11:38,251
You're just gonna get
more and more tense.

671
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:40,337
Huh?

672
01:11:40,461 --> 01:11:45,535
- So you're May's cousin, huh?
- Yeah. See that right there?

673
01:11:45,662 --> 01:11:49,097
That's the result of tension, askin' me that.

674
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,452
- What?
- Askin' me if I'm her cousin.

675
01:11:51,581 --> 01:11:54,733
- You know I'm not her cousin.
- How would I know that?

676
01:11:54,862 --> 01:11:57,695
- Do I look like her cousin?
- She said you were.

677
01:11:57,822 --> 01:12:02,373
- She's lyin'.
- Well, what are you, then?

678
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:07,137
You're really gettin' tense.

679
01:12:07,262 --> 01:12:11,972
- Maybe I just better go on.
- No, wait. Martin, don't go.

680
01:12:12,103 --> 01:12:13,855
Don't go, Marty.

681
01:12:13,983 --> 01:12:17,976
It is blue and Ionely
out there in the black night.

682
01:12:18,103 --> 01:12:20,059
I'll tell you what.

683
01:12:20,183 --> 01:12:24,654
Let's go over to the bar and
have us a little drink. What do you say?

684
01:12:24,783 --> 01:12:28,333
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah. She's always OK.

685
01:12:28,464 --> 01:12:32,695
She's just takin' her time just to torture ya.

686
01:12:32,824 --> 01:12:38,456
- How will she know where we went?
- She knows. She's got a sixth sense.

687
01:12:49,344 --> 01:12:52,496
Come on, Marty.
Come on. There we go.

688
01:12:52,624 --> 01:12:55,219
There we go. There we go.

689
01:13:27,907 --> 01:13:32,139
What exactly
is the matter with May anyway?

690
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:35,899
- She's in a state of shock.
- Shock?

691
01:13:36,027 --> 01:13:39,258
- How come?
- Well...

692
01:13:39,388 --> 01:13:41,537
We haven't seen each other
in a long time.

693
01:13:42,068 --> 01:13:47,142
Me and her, we go back quite a way.
High school.

694
01:13:47,268 --> 01:13:49,224
Oh, really? Oh.

695
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:54,181
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah. A lot of miles.

696
01:13:54,308 --> 01:13:57,301
So you're not really cousins, then?

697
01:13:57,428 --> 01:14:01,104
Well, not really, no.

698
01:14:04,029 --> 01:14:06,418
- You're her husband?
- No.

699
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:10,305
No.

700
01:14:19,749 --> 01:14:21,706
She's my sister.

701
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:27,819
- Your sister?
- Mm.

702
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:32,023
Hm. So you knew each other
even before high school?

703
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:35,506
No. I never even knew I had a sister
until it was too late.

704
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:39,418
- How do you mean?
- By the time I found out, we'd already...

705
01:14:41,631 --> 01:14:45,419
you know... fooled around.

706
01:14:55,632 --> 01:14:57,826
- You fooled around?
- Yeah.

707
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,227
Mm-hm.

708
01:15:02,992 --> 01:15:05,028
That's illegal, isn't it?

709
01:15:05,152 --> 01:15:08,701
- Only if you get caught.
- Hey. Who is this guy?

710
01:15:08,832 --> 01:15:12,427
- Is that true? She's really your sister?
- Half. Only half.

711
01:15:12,552 --> 01:15:15,545
- Which half?
- The top half.

712
01:15:15,673 --> 01:15:17,629
In horses we call that the top side.

713
01:15:17,752 --> 01:15:23,032
And the mare is what?
The mare is distaff.

714
01:15:23,634 --> 01:15:26,101
Ain't that the bottom half? Distaff.

715
01:15:26,234 --> 01:15:28,872
It's funny I should remember that.

716
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:36,106
You fooled around
in high school together?

717
01:15:36,234 --> 01:15:40,273
- Everybody fools around in high school.
- I never did.

718
01:15:40,394 --> 01:15:43,147
- Maybe you should have.
- Not with my sister, anyway.

719
01:15:43,274 --> 01:15:45,550
I wouldn't recommend that.

720
01:15:50,714 --> 01:15:53,354
How could that happen? I mean...

721
01:15:53,475 --> 01:15:55,625
Well, see...

722
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:02,425
Our daddy fell in love twice.

723
01:16:04,955 --> 01:16:07,424
That's basically how it happened.

724
01:16:07,555 --> 01:16:12,107
Once with my mom
and once with her mom.

725
01:16:12,236 --> 01:16:16,388
It was the same love,
it just got split in two, that's all.

726
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:24,267
How come you didn't know each other
until high school?

727
01:16:24,397 --> 01:16:27,116
He lived two separate lives.

728
01:16:27,797 --> 01:16:31,391
Two completely separate lives.

729
01:16:34,157 --> 01:16:38,753
He'd live with me and my mom and then
he'd go and live with her and her mom.

730
01:16:39,277 --> 01:16:44,113
Don't be too hard on me, boy.
It's happened to the best of us.

731
01:16:45,957 --> 01:16:49,507
- You never knew what was goin' on?
- No.

732
01:16:50,838 --> 01:16:53,910
Never knew.
Neither did my mother.

733
01:16:54,038 --> 01:16:56,347
- She knew.
- She never knew.

734
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,788
She must have suspected
somethin' was going on.

735
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:04,992
Well... if she did,
she never let on to me about it.

736
01:17:08,519 --> 01:17:11,511
Maybe she was afraid of findin' out.

737
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:19,469
Or maybe she just... loved him.
I don't know.

738
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,439
He'd disappear.

739
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,118
Months at a time he'd disappear.

740
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,594
She never once asked where he went.

741
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,432
She was always glad to see him, though.

742
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,877
I remember, me and her, we used to go
runnin' out of the house to meet him

743
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:48,995
as soon as we saw him in the old
Studebaker, drivin' across the fields.

744
01:17:49,121 --> 01:17:51,077
It was a Willis.

745
01:17:52,442 --> 01:17:55,673
I never owned a goddamn Studebaker.

746
01:17:57,402 --> 01:18:00,279
It was a Willis Knight.

747
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:12,959
How'd you finally find out
that she was your sister?

748
01:18:14,082 --> 01:18:16,517
This went on for years, see.

749
01:18:17,882 --> 01:18:20,078
Honey.

750
01:18:20,202 --> 01:18:23,832
He kept disappearing
and then reappearing.

751
01:18:29,923 --> 01:18:34,236
And... then one day it stopped.

752
01:18:38,364 --> 01:18:40,924
He just stayed home for a while.

753
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,632
He stayed in the house.
He never went outside.

754
01:18:49,844 --> 01:18:57,638
He just sat in his chair, starin'.
Then he started goin' on these walks.

755
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:06,441
He'd go on these long walks and he'd
walk all day and he'd walk all night.

756
01:19:06,565 --> 01:19:08,522
Ellie!

757
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:14,038
He'd just disappear in the dark.

758
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:28,286
I remember watchin' him
from my bedroom window.

759
01:19:29,326 --> 01:19:33,683
He'd just disappear in the dark
with his overcoat on.

760
01:19:34,806 --> 01:19:36,797
Where was he going?

761
01:19:38,927 --> 01:19:40,883
Just walkin'.

762
01:19:43,527 --> 01:19:46,883
I was making a decision.

763
01:19:47,007 --> 01:19:48,964
And one night...

764
01:19:50,928 --> 01:19:53,725
I asked him if I could go with him.

765
01:19:58,728 --> 01:20:00,685
And he took me.

766
01:20:03,128 --> 01:20:06,166
We walked straight out
across the fields together.

767
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:11,443
I remember it was just ploughed
and our feet sank down in the powder.

768
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:17,365
The dirt came up over the tops
of my shoes and weighed me down.

769
01:20:17,489 --> 01:20:21,244
I wanted to stop and empty my shoes out
but he wouldn't stop.

770
01:20:21,369 --> 01:20:24,839
He kept walkin' straight ahead.

771
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:30,602
I was afraid of losin' him in the dark,
so I just kept up as best I could.

772
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,925
And we were completely silent
the whole time.

773
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:40,928
We never said a word to each other.

774
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:43,121
We could barely see a foot in front of us

775
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:47,881
and these white owls kept swooping down
out of nowhere, hunting forjack rabbits,

776
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:51,287
diving right past our heads
and disappearing.

777
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:56,930
We just kept walkin' silent like that
for miles until we got to town.

778
01:21:00,451 --> 01:21:06,482
I remember seein' the old man in
the liquor store as he paid for the bottle.

779
01:21:18,372 --> 01:21:22,651
Then he came out with the bottle
wrapped in a brown paper sack.

780
01:21:22,772 --> 01:21:26,243
What are you doin'?
Attacking me or something?

781
01:21:26,373 --> 01:21:29,604
He opened the bottle up
and offered it to me.

782
01:21:29,733 --> 01:21:33,442
Before he even took a drink,
he offered it to me first.

783
01:21:33,574 --> 01:21:37,328
I took it and drank it
and handed it back to him.

784
01:21:37,453 --> 01:21:42,528
We just kept passing it back and forth
like that till we drank the whole thing dry.

785
01:21:43,934 --> 01:21:49,214
Finally we reached this little white house
with a red awning on the far side of town.

786
01:21:49,334 --> 01:21:52,566
# Listen to me, woman
Listen to me

787
01:21:52,694 --> 01:21:55,925
# I want you to understand

788
01:21:56,055 --> 01:22:00,332
We walked right up to the front porch
and he rang the bell.

789
01:22:22,696 --> 01:22:28,249
I remember gettin' real nervous because
I wasn't expecting to visit anybody.

790
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:32,370
And then this woman comes to the door.

791
01:22:33,457 --> 01:22:36,608
This real pretty woman with red hair.

792
01:22:36,737 --> 01:22:41,447
And she throws herself into his arms
and he starts crying.

793
01:22:41,577 --> 01:22:45,331
He just breaks down
right there in front of me.

794
01:22:46,377 --> 01:22:49,130
She's kissing him all on the face.

795
01:22:49,258 --> 01:22:52,215
He's just cryin' like a little baby.

796
01:22:55,978 --> 01:22:57,934
And then...

797
01:23:02,498 --> 01:23:06,936
through the doorway behind them both,
I see this girl.

798
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:10,574
She just appears.

799
01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:16,574
She's just standin' there starin' at me.

800
01:23:21,219 --> 01:23:23,494
And I'm starin' back at her.

801
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:32,013
Can't take our eyes off each other.

802
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:42,133
It was like we knew each other from
somewhere but we couldn't place where.

803
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:49,816
But the second we saw each other,
that very second,

804
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:54,817
we knew we'd never stop bein' in love.

805
01:24:14,662 --> 01:24:19,736
Boy, you're incredible.
You're just unbelievable.

806
01:24:19,862 --> 01:24:23,014
Martin comes all the way over here,
doesn't know you from Adam.

807
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:26,817
You start tellin' him a story like that.
Are you crazy?

808
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:31,336
Are you?

809
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:37,058
None of it's true, Martin.
He's had this weird, sick idea for years.

810
01:24:37,183 --> 01:24:42,212
It's totally made up. I don't know
where he got it from. He's a bit nuts.

811
01:24:43,944 --> 01:24:47,220
I don't know where he got it from,
but he's completely nuts.

812
01:24:47,344 --> 01:24:52,465
She's a little embarrassed about
the whole thing. You can't blame her.

813
01:24:52,584 --> 01:24:56,214
- Hand me a glass, please.
- You heard that, huh?

814
01:24:56,344 --> 01:24:58,654
Oh, yeah, I heard it.

815
01:24:58,785 --> 01:25:03,097
I heard it, every word of it,
and I followed it very carefully.

816
01:25:03,225 --> 01:25:08,345
He's told me the same story a thousand
times and it always changes. Always.

817
01:25:08,465 --> 01:25:13,494
- I never, ever repeat myself.
- You do nothin' but repeat yourself.

818
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:17,778
That's all you do. You go around
in one big circle. Round and round.

819
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:21,216
Did you think it was a story?
Did you think I made that whole thing up?

820
01:25:21,346 --> 01:25:24,782
At the time you were tellin' it
it seemed real.

821
01:25:24,906 --> 01:25:28,182
But now you're doubtin' it
because she says it's a lie?

822
01:25:28,306 --> 01:25:33,745
She suggests it's a lie and
all of a sudden you change your mind?

823
01:25:33,867 --> 01:25:37,143
- Let's go to the movies.
- Nobody is goin' to the movies.

824
01:25:37,267 --> 01:25:41,943
There's not a movie in a hundred miles
that can match the story I'm gonna tell.

825
01:25:42,067 --> 01:25:46,061
- I'm gonna finish this story, OK?
- Eddie...

826
01:25:46,187 --> 01:25:49,543
- You wanna hear the rest of the story?
- Sure.

827
01:25:49,668 --> 01:25:51,623
OK. Good.

828
01:25:54,428 --> 01:25:58,182
- I'm dyin' to hear it myself.
- Yeah.

829
01:25:58,308 --> 01:26:01,141
You think
this is gonna change something?

830
01:26:01,268 --> 01:26:03,224
No.

831
01:26:04,668 --> 01:26:09,106
- Then what's the point?
- It's absolutely pointless.

832
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:12,820
Why put everybody through this?

833
01:26:12,949 --> 01:26:15,782
Martin don't wanna hear
this bullshit and neither do I.

834
01:26:15,908 --> 01:26:18,343
I know you don't wanna hear it.

835
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:24,186
Don't try and pass it off on me, Eddie.

836
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:28,383
You got it turned around.

837
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:32,503
You got it all turned around.

838
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:36,179
You don't even know
which end is up any more.

839
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,942
I don't need either of you.

840
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,459
I don't need any of it.

841
01:26:49,711 --> 01:26:52,669
Cos I know the whole rest of the story.

842
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,179
I know exactly how it happened.

843
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:58,383
Without adding any little tricks onto it,
Eddie.

844
01:26:58,511 --> 01:27:01,628
- What does she know?
- She's lyin'.

845
01:27:05,912 --> 01:27:08,904
Want me to finish it for you, Eddie? Huh?

846
01:27:09,912 --> 01:27:13,348
Want me to finish the story for ya, Eddie?

847
01:27:20,753 --> 01:27:24,142
See, my mother...

848
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:25,228
May?

849
01:27:25,353 --> 01:27:29,869
My momma, the pretty red-haired lady.

850
01:27:32,593 --> 01:27:34,549
She was. She was...

851
01:27:37,313 --> 01:27:40,750
She was desperately in love
with the old man.

852
01:27:41,793 --> 01:27:45,503
Wasn't she, Eddie?
You could see it in her eyes.

853
01:27:45,633 --> 01:27:51,391
She was so obsessed with him
that she couldn't stand to be without him.

854
01:27:52,674 --> 01:27:54,790
Even for a second.

855
01:27:56,074 --> 01:27:59,703
So she kept hunting for him
from town to town

856
01:27:59,835 --> 01:28:06,308
and following clues he'd leave behind,
like a postcard, a motel matchbook.

857
01:28:08,195 --> 01:28:13,907
He didn't ever leave anything simple
behind like a telephone number

858
01:28:14,035 --> 01:28:15,992
or an address.

859
01:28:17,516 --> 01:28:21,508
Cos, you see,
my momma was his little secret.

860
01:28:22,476 --> 01:28:24,432
She hounded him.

861
01:28:25,476 --> 01:28:28,593
Hounded him for years and years.

862
01:28:34,117 --> 01:28:38,076
And he just kept tryin'
to keep her at a distance.

863
01:28:40,596 --> 01:28:44,431
Cos, see,
the closer these two separate lives,

864
01:28:46,277 --> 01:28:48,347
these two separate kids,

865
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:52,833
these two separate women got together,

866
01:28:55,078 --> 01:28:57,273
the more nervous he got.

867
01:28:59,837 --> 01:29:02,591
And the more filled with terror

868
01:29:04,478 --> 01:29:08,710
that these two lives
would find out about each other

869
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:14,031
and his little secret
would devour him whole,

870
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,467
just take him by the throat.

871
01:29:21,478 --> 01:29:24,039
She finally caught up with him.

872
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:27,109
She just dulled him down.

873
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,073
I remember that day
when we got to that town

874
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,716
and she kept sayin' - she was on fire,
she was crazy - she kept sayin'

875
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,277
"This is it.
This is the place, May. This is the place."

876
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,279
And her whole body was tremblin' like this

877
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,519
as we were walkin' through the streets
lookin' for this house.

878
01:29:51,321 --> 01:29:55,473
I remember
she was holdin' my hand so tight,

879
01:29:55,601 --> 01:29:59,753
I thought she was gonna crush
all the bones in my fingers.

880
01:30:00,681 --> 01:30:03,479
She was so terrified.

881
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:08,117
She was so terrified
she was gonna run into him by accident,

882
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,994
cos she knew she was trespassin'.

883
01:30:12,482 --> 01:30:17,237
She knew she was crossin'
into the forbidden zone.

884
01:30:23,522 --> 01:30:26,515
But she couldn't help herself.

885
01:30:38,203 --> 01:30:42,082
So we walked all day
in that stupid hick town.

886
01:30:43,123 --> 01:30:45,080
All day.

887
01:30:45,203 --> 01:30:50,596
Goin' up and down every street
in all these neighbourhoods,

888
01:30:50,724 --> 01:30:53,682
lookin' in on every dumb family,

889
01:30:53,804 --> 01:30:57,353
peerin' through all these open windows.

890
01:30:57,485 --> 01:31:01,079
I remember it was exactly supper time

891
01:31:01,204 --> 01:31:04,561
cos everybody was sittin'
around the table havin' fried chicken.

892
01:31:04,684 --> 01:31:08,473
That's how close we were to the window.
We could see what they were eatin'.

893
01:31:08,604 --> 01:31:12,678
We could hear the voices but we couldn't
make out what they were sayin'.

894
01:31:12,805 --> 01:31:16,115
But Eddie and his momma were talkin'

895
01:31:16,245 --> 01:31:19,715
and the old man, he just sat there.

896
01:31:19,846 --> 01:31:22,882
He didn't say nothin', did he, Eddie?

897
01:31:24,086 --> 01:31:28,159
He just sat there in silence,
eatin' his fried chicken.

898
01:31:28,286 --> 01:31:31,164
She's off the wall.
You gotta do something about this.

899
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:44,283
The funny thing was, almost as soon
as we found him, he disappeared.

900
01:31:47,767 --> 01:31:51,203
She weren't with him
but a couple of weeks.

901
01:31:51,327 --> 01:31:54,081
He just... vanished.

902
01:31:57,288 --> 01:32:00,519
Nobody ever saw him after that. Ever.

903
01:32:06,808 --> 01:32:10,642
And Momma,
she just turned herself inside out.

904
01:32:12,249 --> 01:32:18,484
I couldn't understand it. She grieved
like somebody had died or somethin'.

905
01:32:18,608 --> 01:32:21,919
I just couldn't understand that.

906
01:32:22,049 --> 01:32:25,007
Cos I was feelin'just the opposite.

907
01:32:29,049 --> 01:32:31,006
See, I...

908
01:32:34,209 --> 01:32:36,166
I was in love.

909
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:46,845
I remember I'd come home from school
after bein' with Eddie

910
01:32:48,451 --> 01:32:51,523
and I was filled with this joy that...

911
01:32:58,571 --> 01:33:01,085
And there she'd be.

912
01:33:01,211 --> 01:33:05,967
She'd be standin' in the kitchen
just starin' at the sink.

913
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:09,287
And her eyes looked like a funeral.

914
01:33:09,412 --> 01:33:14,485
I didn't know what to say to her.
I didn't even feel sorry for her.

915
01:33:14,612 --> 01:33:17,206
Cos all I could think of was him.

916
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:21,760
And all he could think about was me.

917
01:33:21,892 --> 01:33:24,167
Isn't that right, Eddie?

918
01:33:26,692 --> 01:33:30,766
We couldn't take a breath
without thinkin' of each other.

919
01:33:30,892 --> 01:33:34,727
We couldn't eat,
couldn't sleep unless we were together.

920
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:39,612
Eddie's mom didn't know
what was wrong with him.

921
01:33:40,853 --> 01:33:46,804
But my momma...
my momma knew exactly.

922
01:33:49,533 --> 01:33:51,889
Right down to her bones.

923
01:33:53,134 --> 01:33:58,083
She went to Eddie
and she begged him not to see me.

924
01:34:02,294 --> 01:34:06,174
She went to Eddie's mom and begged her.

925
01:34:13,495 --> 01:34:15,451
But Eddie's mother...

926
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:22,773
Eddie's mother blew her brains out,
didn't she, Eddie?

927
01:34:24,016 --> 01:34:26,450
She blew her brains right out.

928
01:34:31,016 --> 01:34:35,009
Now, wait a second.
Just a goddamn second here.

929
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:37,809
This story doesn't hold water.

930
01:34:38,857 --> 01:34:42,246
You ain't gonna let her off the hook
with that one, are you?

931
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:46,495
That's the dumbest version
I ever heard in my whole life.

932
01:34:46,617 --> 01:34:51,611
She never blew her brains out.
Nobody ever told me that.

933
01:34:51,737 --> 01:34:54,695
Where in the hell did that come from?

934
01:34:56,537 --> 01:34:58,493
Well?

935
01:34:58,618 --> 01:35:00,573
Well, stand up.

936
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:06,016
Get on your feet now, goddammit!
I wanna hear the male side of this thing!

937
01:35:06,138 --> 01:35:09,687
You're gonna represent me now.
You're gonna speak on my behalf.

938
01:35:09,818 --> 01:35:12,890
There's nobody to speak for me now.

939
01:35:13,018 --> 01:35:15,408
Get up.

940
01:35:15,538 --> 01:35:19,737
Well, tell her, then.
Tell her what really happened.

941
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:31,535
It was your shotgun.

942
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:44,614
Same one we used to duck-hunt with.
Browning.

943
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,858
She'd never fired a gun in her whole life.

944
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:57,017
That was her first time.

945
01:36:05,381 --> 01:36:07,576
Nobody ever told me that.

946
01:36:09,262 --> 01:36:11,570
I was left completely in the dark
on that one.

947
01:36:12,461 --> 01:36:15,897
- You were gone.
- Somebody could have found me.

948
01:36:16,021 --> 01:36:19,014
They could have hunted me down.
I wasn't impossible to find.

949
01:36:19,142 --> 01:36:23,772
- You were gone.
- I know I was gone, God damn you!

950
01:36:25,262 --> 01:36:27,219
I was gone!

951
01:36:28,343 --> 01:36:31,460
But I wasn't disconnected.

952
01:36:31,582 --> 01:36:34,494
There was nothing cut off in me.
Don't you forget that.

953
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:39,139
Everything went on just the same
as before I left. Nothing changed.

954
01:36:46,183 --> 01:36:51,736
But your mother... Your mother
wouldn't give it up, would she?

955
01:36:51,863 --> 01:36:56,142
She drew me to her.
She went out of her way to draw me in.

956
01:36:56,264 --> 01:36:58,380
She was a force.

957
01:36:59,144 --> 01:37:02,580
I told her I'd never come across for her
from the very beginning,

958
01:37:02,704 --> 01:37:05,172
but she kept opening up to me.

959
01:37:05,304 --> 01:37:07,944
She kept...

960
01:37:14,265 --> 01:37:16,381
See, she... She...

961
01:37:17,345 --> 01:37:21,463
She... She kept
opening up her heart to me, see.

962
01:37:21,585 --> 01:37:26,580
You know, how could I turn her down
when she loved me like that?

963
01:37:26,705 --> 01:37:29,345
How could I turn away from her?

964
01:37:29,466 --> 01:37:32,299
We were completely whole.

965
01:37:34,586 --> 01:37:36,736
What are you doing?

966
01:37:38,146 --> 01:37:41,343
Speak to her.
Bring her round to our side.

967
01:37:41,466 --> 01:37:43,697
Make her see this thing in a clear light!

968
01:37:45,947 --> 01:37:47,938
Stay away from her, now.

969
01:37:48,387 --> 01:37:51,379
What the hell are you doing?
Keep away from her!

970
01:37:51,827 --> 01:37:54,136
You two can't come together.

971
01:37:54,587 --> 01:37:58,705
You gotta hold up my end of this deal.
I got nobody now.

972
01:37:58,827 --> 01:38:00,818
You can't betray me now.

973
01:38:03,587 --> 01:38:05,146
You're my son.

974
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,946
I ain't staying. I ain't.

975
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:02,187
May?

976
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:04,700
- Hey, May!

977
01:39:09,591 --> 01:39:13,027
The whole place is burnin' down, May.

978
01:39:13,151 --> 01:39:16,063
Wait a minute, May. May?

979
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:20,185
Do you need some help or anything?

980
01:39:28,592 --> 01:39:31,231
I got a truck. I can drive you
anywhere you wanna go.

981
01:39:46,073 --> 01:39:48,030
Where are you goin'?

982
01:39:48,153 --> 01:39:50,109
May?

983
01:39:52,274 --> 01:39:54,993
You're not goin' with him, are you?

984
01:39:55,113 --> 01:39:57,070
He's gone.

985
01:39:58,754 --> 01:39:59,708
May?

986
01:40:14,355 --> 01:40:16,424
May!
