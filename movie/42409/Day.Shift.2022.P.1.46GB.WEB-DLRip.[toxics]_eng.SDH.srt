36

Doing the same thing over and over

62
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,416
I'm calling because your husband
is late again picking up Paige.

63
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,875
Do you have an ETA
of when we should expect him?

64
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,375
All right, but this is
the third time this week that he's late.

65
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,250
I shouldn't have to remind you that…

66
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,500
-Just a sec. He's pulling up.

67
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,500
Paige!

68
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,750

-Come on, baby!

69
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,500

70
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,583
-Who's your favorite daddy?
-You.

71
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,958
I'm your only daddy, I hope. What's up?

72
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,625
-You're late, you know?
-What?

73
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,958
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

74
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,166
You know why I'm late? 'Cause this job.

75
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,041
-Work is dumb.
-Oh, well, yes, it is.

76
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,333
And what do you have in your hand? Oh…

77
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,666
-A little something.
-Shaboom! I love that.

78

-How about this? Hmm?

79
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,958
-All right.
-Can we go to Yogurtworld?

80
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,333
Yogurtworld. Oh, Pickle, I don't know.

because we're late.

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,625

95
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,416
-Boom!
-Yeah. Boom.

96
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,208
Got it.

97
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,916
Got it.

98
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,916

this morning?

-Exactly.
-Right.

123
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,250
Whose house was it?

124
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,500
It was Mrs… uh… Mrs. Jones' house.

125
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,416
Where's she live?

126
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,041
She, uh…

127
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,208
With Mr. Jones. That's exactly…

128
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,125
-Right over there on Mr. Jones Way.
-Oh my God. Bud.

129
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,375
We'd get much further
if you'd be straight with me.

130
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,041
-I am being straight.
-You're not.

131
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,458
I am being straight, but the question is,
what is that sponge doing on the ground?

132
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,208
And this? What is all this?

133
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,041
I am fixing the broken tile.

134
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,500
Mm-hmm. I see that. And why?

135
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,833
Uh, what does it matter?

136
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,458
-You don't live here anymore.
-Wow, that's what we doing?

137
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,833
What I was gonna tell you
is that this tile goes…

138
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,791
Joss, what's this? This a new door?

139
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,875
Uh…

140
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,625
A door with five locks doesn't exactly

141
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,875
send the right impression
to potential buyers.

142
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,000
Buyers? Buyers?
What are you talking about, Joss?

143
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,333
I didn't want to tell you this way, but…

144
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,875
I'm thinking about selling the house
and taking my mom up on her offer.

145
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,625
You and your momma.

146
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,750
Florida?

147
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,333
What are you talking about?
You can't move to Florida.

148
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,458
All her friends are here.
I'm here. Her world is here.

149
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,541
She needs stability.

150
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,000
She has stability.
She got you. She got me.

151
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,250
She got Yogurtworld.
Ain't no Yogurtworld in Florida!

152
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,875
Yeah, and she also has a school

153
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,208
that she's not gonna be able to go to
unless we pay tuition by Monday.

154
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,583
Then let's pay the tu… Mon--

155
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,708
Monday? Monday, like in seven days?

156
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,666
Yeah, which you would know
if you had checked your voice mails.

157
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,541
Is that the stability you talk about?

158
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,125
-How much is it?
-Five grand.

159
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,916
Five thousand dollars for a child?

160
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,458
Mm-hmm. And she needs braces.

161
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,875
-What's wrong?
-Her teeth are jacked up.

162
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,041
She always says she likes her teeth
'cause they look like my teeth.

163
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,208
That's my point.

164
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,583
Okay. Well, how much are braces?
What? Five, six hundred dollars?

165
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,250
-Without insurance, try six grand.
-Six grand?

166
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,791
But I did find a guy who quoted me $4,800.

167
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,166
-I know we done been through a whole lot.
-Yeah.

168
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,541
Just, please, don't take my daughter away.

169
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,625
Till Monday. Just give me till Monday.

170
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,875
Ten grand. Tuition, teeth, everything.

171
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,666
Okay, fine. I will give you till Monday.

172
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,583
Come on, hug me.

173
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,958
-Hug me.
-I'm hugging you.

174
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,416
-Stop listening to your mom. She drinks.
-What?

175
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,333
-Uh, Bud.
-What?

176
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,750
I have one more question.

177
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,416
Paige said that there's
a porn star living in your building?

178
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,750
How does she even know
what a porn star is?

179
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,416
It's the Valley, Joss.

194
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,250
Decided to take me up on my offer?

195
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,041
Not today, not tomorrow, not anytime.

196
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,041

-Ooh. Thank you!

Snake Eyes ain't for sale now.

You just have to be desperate enough.

200

-So, what do you got for Troy?
-Desperate, huh?

201
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,458
Mm-hmm.

202
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,375
-That's what I got for Troy.

203
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,041
Money. All right.

204
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,125
Right there.

205
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,083
-Ooh, nice.
-Count that.

206
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,666
Let's see, uh…

207
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,000
-Oh, this is a young male.
-Mm-hmm.

208
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,708
Garden-variety, it's like Eastern…

209
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,583
Hey, smoker…

210
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,500
-Nasty habit, don't you think?
-Yeah.

211
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,208
He would have died from smoking
if he wasn't dead already.

212
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,291
Count the shit up.

213
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,125
Let's check this out.
Uh, yeah, you see there?

214
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,291
-Yeah, solid bloodline.
-Mm-hmm.

215
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,791
Must've gotten here
through Mexico or something.

216
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,791
-He fed recently, you see that?
-Yeah.

217
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,083
Okay. Well, how much?

218
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,708
{\an8}Eight hundred? $800? A piece?

219
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,916
No, both.

220
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,375
Troy, what are you talking about?
Look at that again.

221
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,000
-That's worth at least four grand.
-Down at the Union.

222
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,833
-Why don't you try the Union?
-Come on.

223
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,458
I can't go to the Union. You know that.

224
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,708
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I… I forgot you can't go to the Union.

225
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,375
-That's why you're coming to me. Huh?

226
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,958
And I'm offering you 800 for both.

227
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,958
All right, forget it.
Just check the Elder's.

228
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,000
Elder?

229
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,500
That's a different story. That's 20 grand.

230
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,375
Boom. Perfect. Done.

231
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,791
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,041
If she had been an Elder,

233
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,291
which she's not.

234
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,500
Check this out.

235
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,041
A decade early
and a whole lot of dollars short,

236
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,375
so I can give you like two grand for this.

237
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,666
-Two thousand, Troy?
-Mm-hmm.

238
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,958
Two thousand?

239
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,333
Listen, I don't think you understand.
I need cash today.

240
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,625
Then go and rob a bank or do something.
I'm a businessman!

241
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,208
Forget the Elder's.
How about this? Silver.

242
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,250
Hmm?

243
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,125
Silver? This is…

244
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,791
-Just gonna put that in your mouth, huh?
-This plated shit? Please, Bud.

245
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,083
You wanna make a deal or not?

246
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,333
Shit.

247
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,333
Snake Eyes, 1,500.

248
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,083
Ah, twelve.

249
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,166
You said 1,500 when I walked in here.
It is 1,500.

250
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
Before I knew you were desperate.

251
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,041
That's everything I have.

252
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,708
Well, I think you have something else.

253
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,625
Are those Jordans?

254
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,166
What size?

255
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,541
Hey. Hey, Pickle. How you doing?

256
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,166
Dad, are we moving?

257
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,375
-Are we what?
-Are we moving?

258
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,458
No. No. What makes you think that?

259
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,875
Mom says I might have
to start a new school.

260
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,708
That's what Mom says, huh?

261
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:44,541
Well, you know Mom is a jokester,
and I love her to death, but…

262
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,833
But we're not going anywhere.

263
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,833
You're not going anywhere, okay?

264
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,250
Okay, good. Thanks, Daddy.

265
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,958
-I love you.
-I love you too!

266
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,458
I need you, bro.

267
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,750
We have already agreed
to take delivery of the product

268
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,375
and to help with placement in Simi Valley.

269
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,416
You had no authority to take out Sasha.

270
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,083
I'm going to have to rethink our deal.

271
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,625
Sasha is the past,
and I am the future.

272
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,000
We already own the night,

273
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,291
but my product
will allow us to seize the day.

274
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,333
So here is your choice.

275
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:50,000
You join me, and we take over the Valley,
or you can join him. Comprendes?

I see you. What's happening?

290
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,208
You know me,
cutting necks and cashing checks.

291

Yeah. Thanks for meeting me, man.

292
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:29,083
Least I can do for the player that
snatched my ass out the sandbox twice.

293
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,000
How's Seeger?

294
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:31,916
Same.

295
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,291
-Or worse.
-Damn.

296
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,541
You think he'll listen?

297
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,916
-Things have changed since you left.
-I ain't never left, Big J.

298
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,250
Well, since you got
your ass kicked out the Union.

299
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,583
Look here. I'm putting my name and my ass
on the line by vouching for you.

300
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,083
Can you play this shit by the books?

301
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,250
I got to. I got to get that Union card,
or I'm gonna lose my family.

302
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,583
Look, I need ten large
in the next five days,

303
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,666
or Joss is gonna take Paige
down to Florida.

304
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,583
That's bad.

305
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,375
The Union is the only place
gonna give me that kind of coin.

306
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,583
-I got you. Lock and load.
-All right.

307
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,750
She's done this before, man.
Pump faking, whatever.

308
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,458
But right now, it seems like it's real.

309
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,875
Hi, Momoko!

310
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,000
How are you?

311
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,083
Momoko.

312
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,416
Yes?

313
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,708
Pink penguin puffy pants.

314
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,291
See you ain't missed a step, Big J.

315
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,791
JJ Perry to the trade counter.

316
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,541
-Wow.
-JJ Perry to the trade counter.

317
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,416
I don't know how I feel about this.

318
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,291
Things really done changed
around here, huh?

319
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:07,541
Yeah, we ain't just 818 no more.
We done went international.

320
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,666
Look, Paris even blowing up tonight.

321
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,666
Hmm.

322
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,208
Bet money's good out there.

323
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,000
Let's go and get this thing over with.

324
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,416
How's the shirt look?

325
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,375
Stop being nervous, man.
Pull yourself together.

326
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,583
Hey, Big John.

327
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,833
Well, hello, sunshine.

328
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:34,208
He's expecting you,
but he's in one of his moods today.

329
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,458
I took this meeting
out of respect for you, Big John.

330
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:56,166
God knows I wouldn't be
sitting here without your support.

331
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,416
But, uh, I'm certain we all remember

332
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,583
that Mr. Jablonski's previous tenure
as a Union member was…

333
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,458
chock-full of incidents.

334
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,500
Let's just take a look.

335
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,541
Northridge, 2014, violated code 103.

336
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:20,041
Encino, 2015, fleshed out a nest

337
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:23,666
while a child's birthday party
was unfolding next door,

338
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:29,166
endangering civilians,
violating codes 921, 833, and 605,

339
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,250
the worst of which was the failure
to notify law enforcement in due time.

340
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:36,583
-That was a good bust. What happened was--
-And to top it all off…

341
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,125
Canoga Park, 2017,

342
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:45,166
violated code 101,
endangering a fellow Union member's life.

343
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,458
Critical injury sustained.

344
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:52,166
He already had g… gout. He had gout.

345
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,791
Each of these incidents…
meriting a lifelong suspension.

346
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:02,333
And yet, time and again,
you were given warnings.

347
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:06,958
Why should I extend you
yet another lifeline?

348
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:09,583
Ralph, let me be the first to tell you.

349
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,708
-Bud here, he's a new man.
-Yeah.

350
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,958
Is that right?

351
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,333
Yes, sir. Absolutely. I'm a changed man.

352
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,708
I've cut out, uh…

353
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:22,916
pork and cartoons and minimal white women.

354
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:25,625
Bud, I'm curious. Uh…

355
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,833
If you were in my position,

356
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:31,125
sitting across
from a man such as yourself,

357
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:35,791
would you let you back in?

358
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:39,833
If that person
that is in question admits fault

359
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,625
and be apologetic, which I am, and,

360
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,416
on top of that, I just…

361
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,000
Look, Ralph…

362
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,958
Mr. Seeger, I just…

363
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,375
I really need to get out there.
I need to do good.

364
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,541
I promise,
if you give me that opportunity,

365
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,166
I'm not gonna mess it up.

366
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,541
One last chance.

367
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,291
Now that we, uh, got that part settled,

368
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:12,708
I'm gonna go freshen up my coffee
and let you gentlemen cross those T's.

369
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,500
That's a great guy. Great guy.

370
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,375
Really appreciate this second chance.

371
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,750
I don't know what the hell
that man sees in you, Jablonski.

372
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,541
I mean, I know you served together,
but, frankly, I don't care.

373
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:32,458
I've made it my life's work
keeping cowboys like you out of the Union,

374
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,208
so I'll be watching you.

375
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,375
♪ Every step you make ♪

376
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,250
♪ Every shit you take ♪

377
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,791
-♪ Every time you-- ♪
-Everything good?

378
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,916
Quite.

379
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,125
Fill these out, all of them.

380
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,250
Once you pay your initial dues,

381
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,125
we'll get you started
on the health care plan.

382
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,458
There's dental included, right?

383
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,208
After a probationary period lasting…

384
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,500
30 days.

385
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,958
Come on, man. Three days.

386
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,583
Two weeks.

387
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:06,625
-One.

388
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,083
Fine.

389
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,708
With a Union rep
accompanying him in the field.

390
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,583
-Generous. Thank you.
-Great.

391
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,041
All right. Thanks, and, uh…

392
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,166
…I want the night shift.

393
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,083
-Not on my life.
-Come on, Seeger.

394
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,625
-That's where the big money is!
-No. Not a chance.

395
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:28,791
Amount of shit
you stirred up working night shift,

396
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,791
you expect me to let you
back out there where the sun don't shine?

397
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,166
Fine.

398
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,375
Day shift.

399
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,458
Good. Anything else?

400
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:38,958
No.

401
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:43,041
Oh, yeah. I got some,
uh, teeth I need to sell.

402
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,041
Go to the cage.

403
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,166
Seeger, thank you kindly.

404
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,250
Mm-hmm.

405
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,083
And remember, Bud,

406
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,750
one last strike.

407
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,666
Is… Are you referring to bowling, because…

408
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:00,291
-I'm saying there's a strike in bowl--
-You're back. That's all that matters.

409
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:13,791
Carol.

410
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,666
Carol, did you eat my yogurt again?

411
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,000
I even wrote my name on the lid today,

412
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,750
so you literally had to peel back
my name to get to the yogurt.

413
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,750
Oh, what? You can't hear me?

414
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,208
I'm gonna fart in my yogurt,
and you're gonna eat my fart.

415
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,416
Next.

416
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:37,916
Mr. Jablonski?

417
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah. Teeth.

418
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,708
So I look at it like this.
I get back out there, do what I gotta do,

419
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,916
you know, for Mr. Mullet.

420
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,625
This is chipped, female.

421
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:55,291
Appears to be an almost Elder,
roughly 90 years old.

422
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,125
Ninety? You probably need
to check that again.

423
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,125
-You sure it's 90?
-I'm sure.

424
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,041
Huh.

425
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,541
Okay, whatever.

426
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,666
Full price still, right?

427
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,250
I'm sorry. Code 107 in the book
clearly states anything--

428
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,166
Enough of the codes. It's fine.

429
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:19,000
-That's the net for the teeth.
-Yeah, I'll come in… Hey!

430
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:22,666
However, due to
the truncated processing time,

431
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,750
Mr. Seeger would like me to inform you
we need your dues up front,

432
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,375
which, of course, is $5,000.

433
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,875
$5,000? I thought it was two?

434
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,291
Those are 2017 rates, Mr. Jablonski.

435
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,166
Then there is 15%
off the top of every fang,

436
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,833
and we have to hold 50%
until we receive your paperwork.

437
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,916
And, of course, $10
for your membership card,

438
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,083
which gets you one free app
at Cheesecake Factory.

439
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,958
-I don't like cheesecake.
-Do you have that?

440
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,541
Why won't you take the $10 out of that?
Taking everything else.

441
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:52,083
You don't have cash on you?
You really wanna make me split this?

442
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,958
Okay, you are good to go.

443
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:58,958
Am I?

444
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,916
If you have any issues with this,

445
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,500
Carol right here would be happy
to further assist you.

446
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,291
Oh, great. I see you met your Union rep.

447
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:09,875
Huh.

448
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:10,916
What?

449
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,125
Come on, Bud.

450
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:19,625
Sir, please.

451
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,541
That new girl's a smoke show.

452
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,916
Right, but I'm begging you to reconsider.
I'm not meant for the field.

453
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,541
I just bought an ergonomic chair
with my own money. I'm all in on the desk.

454
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,458
That's why I need you out there with him.

455
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,500
Right? Someone who knows
the codes to the letter.

456
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,750
-Okay, but--
-Hey, hey, hey.

457
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,375
Do you wanna move up here?

458
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,750
You gotta get your ass
out in the field. All right?

459
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:38,833
Think about it this way,

460
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,833
you're gonna be
my eyes and ears, my friend.

461
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:41,750
-Right?
-Right--

462
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:45,416
And the minute he messes up,
the minute he goes against code,

463
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,333
you'll be there
reporting it back to me, right?

464
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,916
The sooner he fucks up,

465
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,791
the sooner
your sweet cheeks are in Carol's desk.

466
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,208
You work out?

467
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,500
-A little.
-Yeah, thought so.

468
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,708
♪ I remember ♪

469
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,125
♪ When I was just a bad little boy ♪

470
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:20,750

471
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,583
You're late.

472
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,291
Close it.

473
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,625
I was actually here an hour ago,
but you weren't,

474
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,416
so I went to go get us breakfast.

475
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,833
I got you an organic,
gluten-free, paleo bran muffin.

476
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,208
Really? Thank you.

477
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,666
-I was starving.
-That was a six-dollar muffin.

478
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,541
-What do you have on?
-What?

479
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,125
-What are you wearing?
-Just, like, normal clothes.

480
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,791
The handbook says blend in on the hunt.
Be inconspicuous.

481
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,125
You have on a suit.
How's that inconspicuous?

482
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,541
You have on a suit.
We're in the Valley. In the summertime.

483
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,375
-It's a summery suit.
-A summery suit?

484
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,541
-Juniper green. Yes.
-What is juniper green?

485
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:14,416
A hue of green I found to be complementary
against my skin tone.

486
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,458
Whatever it is, don't wear it again.

487
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:21,291
Look, I'll put myself together,
and we'll take off, all right?

488
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,541
-Do you have somewhere I can hang this?
-Yep.

489
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,000
Not there.

490
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,458
I'll just… hold on to it.

491
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,791
This ain't gonna last.

492
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,583
Got enough weapons and ammo in here
to take down El Jefe, huh?

493
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,625
What you know about El Jefe?

494
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:58,625
Oh, come on.
Legendary 700-year-old European vampire.

495
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,541
Some say he's
at the top of the LA drug trade,

496
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,500
just waiting for his moment to reemerge.

497
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,583
Fangs so sharp, with just one,
you could buy a mansion in Bel Air.

498
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,791
Hmm.

499
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,333
You sound like Big John.

500
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,750
Whole lot of gibberish.
You know that's a crock of shit, right?

501
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,333
I didn't take you for
an arts and crafts guy.

502
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,958
-What are these all about?
-Wanna keep your hands off my shit?

503
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,625
It's my trophy case.

504
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,500
For each one that I kill, I, uh…

505
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,208
They're already dead,
but you get my drift.

506
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,708
'Cause they're allergic to wood. Smart.

507
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,500
They're allergic to wood,
but not just any wood. It's mpingo wood.

508
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:42,500
The strongest African hardwood.
Not that Ikea shit.

509
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,416
We mix it with the garlic.
The wooden bullets pierce the heart.

510
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,125
-The silver--
-Silver to the throat. Right.

511
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:50,083
Yeah. Cuts the head off… usually.

512
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,541
Usually. Right, you are
referring to Uber Vamps,

513
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,333
who have come back from decapitation.

514
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,916
Not if you blast the heart with wood
before you cut their throats with silver.

515
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,208
Mm-hmm. You also forgot to mention
that you can kill them by burning them.

516
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,791
I didn't forget anything.
That's how I get my money.

517
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,833
Why would I burn the fangs?
I don't do that.

518
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,000
Listen, Guacamole Suit,

519
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,000
right there on the shelf,
grab that for me.

520
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,000
Get that, we'll take off.

521
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,625
And remember, whatever you do, don't…

522
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,916
drop my shit.

523
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,500
So, uh, where we going?

524
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:28,250
I'm going hunting. I don't know about you.

530
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,916
Um, yeah,

531
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,458
I mean, usually the seat belts aren't
like this complicated and heavy. But--

532
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,583
It's not complicated.
It's just a seat belt. It protects you.

533
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,500
Sure.

534
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,750
Sure. It's still protecting me though.
If anything happened, it's just--

535
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,833
See? It still catches me.

536
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,416

what we're doing at an animal shelter?

542
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,541
I'm gonna tell you shit.

543
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,708
What you know about Juvies?

544
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:26,291
Juvies or Juveniles, AKA Zombie Vamps,

545
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:29,166
formed when an already young vamp
turns somebody else.

546
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,083
Instead of the strength of a full vamp,

547
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:34,083
they lack regenerative abilities
and appear more dead than alive.

548
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,833
They can't process human blood yet,
so what do they do?

549
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,291
-I'm aware.
-They feed off of small animals, rodents.

550
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,541
So you've read the book?

551
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,375
I don't have to read it. I'm out here.

552
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,083
What do you know
about different species of vampires?

553
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,291
I know there are five types.

554
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,625
Southern, Eastern,
Spider, Uber, and Juvenile.

555
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:52,916
They are largely solitary,
but when together, there is a hierarchy.

556
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,791
They organize by age. What else?

557
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,750
The sunlight is the only thing
they're scared of.

558
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,875
They can't reproduce,
but they can turn people.

559
00:38:58,958 --> 00:38:59,833
Should I continue?

560
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,541
-What about familiars?
-You think this guy's one of them?

561
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,125
I don't know. You tell me.

562
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,333
-Hmm?
-I think he fits the profile.

563
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,666
-You think so?
-Absolutely.

564
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,958
More powerful vamps
have more powerful familiars.

565
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,500
And when it comes to Juvies,
a little kid like this,

566
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,791
he's probably grabbing those cats for 'em,
try to get 'em turned.

567
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,583
-Oh man.
-What?

568
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:24,875
No, I'm just a big cat lover.
I got two of them myself.

569
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,250
Oh. Okay.

570
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,791
Well, that explains it.

571
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,666
-Want to see a picture?
-No, I don't.

572
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,000
Maybe later.

573
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,958
All right. Here we go.

574
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,250
There's his car.

575
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,958
Canoga Bowl. Closed for 18 months.

576
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:57,666
It's perfect.

577
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,125
-Can I offer some advice?
-No.

578
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:03,333
I mean, economically speaking,
why go after Juvies?

579
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,875
Why not let them ripen,
come back when their teeth are valuable?

580
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:09,041
I could come back in September,
but right now, I'm out of time.

581
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,458
And beggars can't be choosers.

582
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,083
Plus, you don't want
these things biting people, do you?

583
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:15,416
Wait. Why don't you have time?

584
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,208
-Why you ask me so many questions?
-I'm just--

585
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,958
Just stay in the truck
and do your business.

586
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:23,333
Stay in the truck? No, I have to be
with you at all times in the field.

587
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,166
-Union rules.
-Other than keeping you alive,

588
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,500
I don't give a shit about rules.

589
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,791
No, no, you don't understand. All times.

590
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:31,125
You're gonna stay in this car.
With that in mind, here.

591
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:34,500
-What? No, I don't believe in guns.
-You don't believe in 'em?

592
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,458
No, they're amoral.
They're killing machines.

593
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,583
They're not for me.

594
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,041
When I was a kid,
I tried shooting a squirrel with a BB gun,

595
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,541
and I just couldn't. All right?

596
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,041
I still have nightmares
where I can see his little face

597
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:49,625
making little squirrel noises,
and I still have nightmares about it.

598
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,041
Made squirrel noises, huh?

599
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,500
-What does a squirrel noise sound like?
-It's like…

600
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,166
Whatever! I don't wanna talk about it.

601
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,583
Stay in the truck.

602
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,833
It's impossible.

603
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,541
How the hell can you be here?

604
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:40,791
It's daytime.

605
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,666
You've been a bad boy, Troy.

606
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,958
Did you know that a vampire
cannot live without its fangs?

607
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:05,416
And yet, for whatever reason,
whatever cruel joke from the gods…

608
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,625
they are the one thing
we cannot regenerate.

609
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,000
Everything that makes a vampire a predator

610
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:19,500
is in its fangs.

611
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:26,833
Each set is a life
that could have lived a thousand lives.

612
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,750
Lives that you had a part in ending.

613
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,333
Yet it wasn't always like this, you know?

614
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,625
There was a time when you humans,
you worshiped us as gods.

615
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:51,708
Right here in this valley, you built
temples of blood and bone to honor us.

616
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,500
And then you turned on us.

617
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,916
Well, guess what?

618
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,625
I'm gonna take back what's ours,

619
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,958
one property at a time.

620
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:12,416
The way I see it,
you have two choices, two doors.

621
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,333
One, you bend the knee
and join me in service, and you live.

622
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:17,666
And two…

623
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,291
you don't.

624
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:25,625
All right.
So, what the hell do you want? Huh?

625
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,791
Who brought you this tooth?

626
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:33,875
A name.

627
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,791
You're so full of shit, lady.

628
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,541
You think you're a god?

629
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,958
You're not gods. You're a big mistake.

630
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:47,500
You're a genetic mutation
that would've died out

631
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,541
if there hadn't been a stinking hole
for y'all to crawl into.

632
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:53,375
Door number two it is.

633
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,916
No. No!

634
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,625
No!

635
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,583
Time for the tooth fairy.

636
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,041
-Ah!

637
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:05,916
♪ Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh ♪

638
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,375
Hello, sir.

639
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,000
How are we on this fine morning?

640
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,000
Any violations to report?

641
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,791
He is certainly heading that way,

642
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,500
but nothing verified quite yet.

643
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:18,916
Well, where is he now?

644
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,083
He left me in the car
and went into a bowling alley.

645
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,125
You didn't follow him?

646
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,583
I thought he was gonna shoot me!
He's very difficult to reason with, sir.

647
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,500
Kid! You want your promotion?

648
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:34,875
You want Carol's desk?

649
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:39,208
Then get off your ass,
get in there, and verify those violations.

650
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:45,166
Ugh! Hair on your nipples!

651
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,083
-Bud?
-Seth!

652
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,833
-Seth!
-Shit.

653
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,583
-Bud!
-Hurry up! Shoot it!

654
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,833
I… I don't have my gun!

655
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,666
-Give me my shotgun!

656
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm… I'm just an observer!

657
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,416
Your gonna be hors d'œuvre
if you don't give me that gun!

658
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,125
Shit! Shit! Shit!

659
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:08,958
Whoa! I'm sorry!

660
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:12,000
Next time I tell you, "Gimme that
goddamn gun," you gimme that goddamn gun!

661
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,291
-Now duck!
-What?

662
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:14,250
I said duck!

663
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,291
You okay?

664
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,875
Oh, jeez. That was horrible.

665
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,375
These Juvie teeth ain't worth shit,
but get enough of 'em…

666
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:39,125
It's a number game like you said.
Uh, you okay?

667
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:40,833
What's going on?

668
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,916
Oh, come on. No, no, I'm not okay.

669
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,666
-All right? Look at me!
-What?

670
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,833
Vampires just tried to kill me.

671
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,375
You put a gun in my face,

672
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:52,208
and now I just pissed
my favorite fucking suit!

673
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:54,416
Hey, hey. Relax. You did good in there.

674
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,750
You did good in there.

675
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,750
Besides, everybody pisses themselves
the first time.

676
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,875
-Really?
-Yeah.

677
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:04,375
-Did you?
-No, I… No, I didn't. But listen, you did.

678
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:08,791
Here, dry your eyes. Dry your eyes, okay.

679
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:09,791
You know what?

680
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,875
Put it on me. My bad.
We bit off more than we could chew today.

681
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:15,541
So why don't we go home, get some rest.

682
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,166
In the morning,
we'll kick some motherfucking ass. Okay?

683
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,083
-Okay.
-All right, come on.

684
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:21,500
Let's get in the car.

685
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:23,875
What the fuck is that?
What'd you eat today?

686
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,541
You know what?

687
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,000
Let's have you get in the back.

688
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:30,250
Don't want you
to get that on my vintage seats.

689
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,291
-What, are you serious?
-Damn right.

690
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,458
Come on. Gotta move.

691
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,833
Hang your leg out the back
so we can air dry.

692
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:05,625
Hey. Hey!

693
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,416
-You forgot your man-purse.
-Wait. That's expens--

694
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,833
You gotta get some of this too.

695
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,791
I'm sure you know, Mr. Union Man.
But when vamps are killed,

696
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:18,166
they release a gas that gets on you
that other vamps can sniff out.

697
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,083
So you gotta get all of that off.
Here, take this.

698
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,500
It's my special blend,
like a little, uh, skunk musk, okay?

699
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:26,666
-Now, get that on you, in the shower.
-Oh Jesus.

700
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,250
On every inch of you, okay?

701
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,833
Be extremely careful.
Don't get it in your eyes.

702
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,083
And whatever you do,

703
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,291
don't get it in your butthole.

704
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:35,750
What happens in the butthole?

705
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,833
I mean, it can't kill you, but…

706
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,458
Jesus Christ.

707
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,416
By the way, lock your doors,
don't come out after dark, and, uh…

708
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,875
-Guess what?
-What?

709
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,041
You're dried up.

710
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:28,708
Oh!

711
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,375
-Oh God. It's okay.
-I'm sorry about that.

712
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,833
-No, no, me. I got it.
-It's okay.

713
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:34,791
It's my fault.
I couldn't see over my baskets.

714
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,375
I got it. This is a… You a… you a doctor?

715
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,000
Uh, nurse, actually.

716
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:42,958
Hope you don't think this is weird,
but you got a lot of scrubs.

717
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:46,875
Yeah, I mean, I hate doing laundry,
so I kind of just kept buying new ones.

718
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,500
-Got out of control.
-Okay.

719
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:51,083
But, hey, new apartment.
Why not start off on the right foot?

720
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:55,208
Yeah. Well, welcome to the building.
I'm right there in 20.

721
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:59,000
-Oh! Well, I'm Heather. I'm in 19.
-Well, I'm Bud 20.

722
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,750
Can you help me with that, actually?

723
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:01,791
Oh. Yeah.

724
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:03,291
-Thanks.
-Yeah, no problem.

725
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,333
-You can just put that down anywhere.
-Sure. Okay.

726
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:11,166
-See you've got a retro vibe poppin', huh?
-Mm-hmm.

727
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,500
-Dig that.
-Thanks.

728
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:15,500
I wish I had a beer
or something to offer you.

729
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:19,666
Uh, a previous tenant left some ice cream
in the freezer, if you're interested.

730
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,416
No, thanks. I'll take a rain check.

731
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,583
-You sure?
-Yeah. Welcome to the building.

732
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,166
Thank you.

733
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:49,166
Feeling better?

734
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,750
Not really.

735
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,833
Got a little bit of that
yellow stuff in my butthole.

736
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:56,375
It was so much worse
than what you even described.

737
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:57,541
Bet it was.

738
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,166
You looking for something?

739
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,916
-Whoa. Hey, that's personal.
-No, no, no.

740
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,375
"Violation code 101, terminated vamps
and didn't report to the Union."

741
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:15,541
"Violation code 276, breaking and entering
without Union sanctions."

742
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:18,000
-That did happen.
-Violation. Violation. Violation.

743
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:21,791
Oh, look at this. "Needs to reimburse me
for six-dollar muffin"?

744
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,416
It's a standard part of Union procedure.

745
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,125
-I have to document everything.
-It's not.

746
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,208
It's for Seeger to keep me out the Union.
Ain't that great?

747
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,958
You almost got me killed yesterday.

748
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,916
You almost got yourself killed yesterday.

749
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I told you stay your punk-ass in the car.
That's why I work by myself.

750
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:38,458
Listen. What? You're gonna die
in the name of kissing your boss's ass?

751
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,416
Well, he didn't give me a choice, okay?

752
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,416
Listen to me, Mr. Union Fellow.

753
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,583
I may not follow all the Union rules,
but let me tell you something.

754
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:48,375
If we went by the book,
we'd both be dead by now!

755
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,791
And you saw that yesterday.

756
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:03,541
Look. Just give me a couple of days.

757
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,000
Okay, a couple days.

758
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,333
So, what's on the agenda today?

759
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:15,541
Like every day.

760
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,125
Hunting vampires.

761
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:27,625
Bud, what are we
doing at a pawn shop?

762
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:31,083
This dude's cheap as shit,
but he got goods we need in order to, uh…

763
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:32,625
What the hell?

764
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,875
Oh Jesus.

765
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,333
Shut up. Shut up.

766
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,166
Hey, hey.

767
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,958
Don't you puke in here!
Don't touch nothing. Don't leave your DNA.

768
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:53,125
I swallowed it.

769
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,166
Troy.

770
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,083
Troy?

771
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:04,833
Damn it.

772
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,583
Wait, is that…

773
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:11,916
It was.

774
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,875
Oh no.

775
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,416
Who… who does that?

776
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:20,875
All right, we gotta move.

777
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,041
Wait a minute. Take this.

778
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,000
Ow!

779
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:28,666
Are you kidding me?

780
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,625
-It's not right, okay. Wait--
-Damn right. How you think he feels, huh?

781
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,666
Come on, let's go.

782
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,833
Wait. You can't leave.
That's against protocol.

783
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:36,750
We have to call the Union
and wait for them.

784
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:39,833
-Code 233 says any hunter who encounters…
-Code? I don't give a shit.

785
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,708
…suspicious civilian death
will be under a 30-day suspension--

786
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,541
We don't have 30 days. I don't give fuck!

787
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,875
We gotta leave.
There's other vamps around here. Let's go.

788
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,916
No, no. I'm calling.

789
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,833
Whoa! We have dead humans here.
We have to report this.

790
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:54,250
That ain't no dead human!
That's my friend!

791
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,666
Listen, I'm not telling you
you cannot report it.

792
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,583
I'm just telling you to delay it.

793
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:02,291
We'll make an anonymous call to the cops,
and, after 24 hours,

794
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,291
you can make
your funky little report. Let's go!

795
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,708
Why do you care?
What difference does a day make?

796
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:09,333
I'm gonna lose my family in a day!
That's the difference!

797
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,375
What?

798
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:14,708
Look, if I don't score some prices
at Union wages by Monday,

799
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:16,625
my wife and my daughter move to Florida.

800
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:20,583
That means, if you call Seeger,
I'm gonna lose my family.

801
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,458
I'm… I'm sorry.

802
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:26,708
Yeah, I bet you are.

803
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:32,666
So what you're saying
is you… you kinda need me.

804
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,583
But…

805
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:36,458
No, I didn't… I didn't say I need you.
I didn't say that.

806
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,250
-No, I just mean…
-I didn't say that.

807
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:41,083
You told me your secrets.
I'm gonna break protocol for you.

808
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,625
-So we're like a team, partners, whatever.
-I didn't say partners.

809
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:45,041
-Crockett and Tubbs.
-No.

810
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,458
-Any partnership you find satisfactory.
-Listen.

811
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,166
What I'm saying is this,

812
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,500
is as a man,
just give me till the weekend.

813
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,708
Yeah, okay. Until the weekend.

814
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:58,875
Yeah.

815
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:07,291
Look. What do you want me to do?
If I keep… he's gonna suspect something.

816
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:08,958
Just relax.

817
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:41,416
I got a tip on this house
from Big J.

818
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:44,541
Why don't you
check the glove box right now?

819
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,708
Yeah.

820
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:49,916
That's what we're doing right there.

821
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,166
That's what we doing.

822
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,208
These… garlic grenades.

823
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:56,000
Pull the pin, garlic and sawdust
comes out, clears the room.

824
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,875
I think. Haven't actually had to use it.

825
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:01,083
But, in theory,
that's what's gonna happen.

826
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,875
An unproven weapon
for my first real vampire fight.

827
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,541
-That's wonderful. Thank you.
-Shit. Shit!

828
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,625
What? What?

829
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,125
Goddamn Nazarian Brothers.

830
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:12,000
Wait, the Nazarian brothers.
Oh, they're big-time hunters.

831
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,833
Yeah, not bigger than me though.

832
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,333
They cleared out all of Glendale.
Now they're headed west.

833
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,458
-Hey, Bud.

834
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:25,000
I thought I smelled chlorine.

835
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,791
Funny. Thought I smelled shit.

836
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,000
-Who's the cupcake?
-Seth.

837
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:34,708
I'm his Union rep. But you can
call me Cupcake or whatever you prefer.

838
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,541
-I'm a big fan, by the way.
-Want to get a selfie for your Instagram?

839
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,083
What you guys doing in Simi Valley?

840
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,916
You know what we're doing here, bro.

841
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,875
We let you do the hard part for us,

842
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,583
figure out which house
is hiding the goods, then, you know.

843
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:50,125
You got me twisted.
I did the work, but I ain't do it for you.

844
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:52,083
Oh, come on, Bud. Think about it.

845
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:56,208
Waste a week waiting for the right moment
that we just might take from you?

846
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:58,083
Or we run up there in force right now.

847
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,666
Sack the place together.
Split the money down the middle.

848
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,541
Well, one, ain't nobody
taking shit from me.

849
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:05,791
And two…

850
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,625
Yeah. It's a good idea.

851
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,625
-Wanna get a selfie?

852
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:21,375
Right now? Is that appropriate?

853
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,500
-We can wait--
-That's not appropriate at all.

854
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:27,333
-What's this?
-Keep your neck from getting chewed out.

855
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,958
Take this. Stay behind me.
I keep you alive.

856
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:33,583
Don't shoot where they are.
Shoot where they're gonna be.

857
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:36,541
You ready? Let's go.

Any vamp gets close to me,

melt hole in their fucking head.

871
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:31,333
Bro, you got any more gum?

872
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,541
-You always share that with your brother?
-We share everything.

873
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,333
D, you're supposed
to pry that shit open, not smash it.

874
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,333
Hey. Are we inside the house or not, bro?

875
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,125
Don't even think about it.

876
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,666
-Got him.

877
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,000
Nice shot, bro.

878
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,291
Time to get paid.

879
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,458
Open up.

880
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:10,666
I told him not to do it.

881
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:15,375
-Really?
-I'm sorry.

882
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:16,750
-Put that gun down.
-Okay.

883
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:18,791
-Take your finger off the trigger.
-Right. Okay.

884
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:20,125
Just watch my six.

885
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,958
Six… Uh…

886
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,000
-It's a hive.
-What?

887
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:45,666
Showtime, bro.

888
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:11,916
Head on out.

889
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:14,291
Bitch-ass.

890
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:29,083
Keep your head on a swivel, all right?
And stay away from the walls.

891
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:31,458
-Oh shit! Bud!

892
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,208
Bud! I don't… What do I do?

893
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:38,416
Ah! You gotta stop wiggling!

894
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:40,666
Oh no!

895
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,833
No!

896
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:43,916
-Oh shit! The gun's broken!

897
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,416
-Take the safety off!
-Help, Bud! My gun's not working.

898
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,833
Oh, come on!

899
01:00:58,708 --> 01:00:59,750
Oh God!

900
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:01,958
Ah!

901
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,000
Ah!

902
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:20,666
Buckshot mouthwash, baby.

903
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:25,000
Nice, bro. Yes.

904
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,250
I got six.

905
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:28,250
You got six. I got five.
I'll catch you up.

906
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh shit! Bud, help me!

907
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:46,125
-Wait, hold up! Wait, hold on! Ah!

908
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,666
Don't let it bite you, Seth!

909
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,833
Haircut time, bro.

910
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:06,666
I'm out!

911
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,333
Ah!

912
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,500
Bud, help me! Bud, help!

913
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,708
This motherfucker threw me up the stairs?

914
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:56,750
-Ah!

915
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:09,875
Bro, send one!

916
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,458
No good!

917
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:29,333
Nice work, bro.

918
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:31,375
Help! Help me!

919
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,791
-Seth, my shotgun!

920
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,583
-Big money, baby.
-Huh? This is what I was talking about.

921
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:07,250
-This was good, yes?
-Very good.

922
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:09,708
What happened to you? You piss your pants?

923
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:14,166
It's kinda my thing.

924
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,750
-Bro.
-What you doing? What're you doing?

925
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,125
Listen, pee-pee pants,
this is man's world, not little boy.

926
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:22,541
Gonna get you a Pamper.
Anyway, listen. Be safe, man. Okay?

927
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:26,375
I'mma take this and put it
towards my baby girl's tuition, you know?

928
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,125
That's why I'm out here. You know…

929
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,416
Familiar on the run.

930
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,333
I got it.

931
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,041
-He's up again. That was vampire.
-I know.

932
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,083
Streets done changed.

933
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,333
I hear they got this sunscreen
that they put on.

934
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:44,458
It's real thick, and they can now last
out in the sunlight like 15, 20 minutes.

935
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:46,916
You know it's made
from the shell of desert tortoise.

936
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,875
It's illegal in 40 countries, right, bro?

937
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:51,500
Vampire sunscreen? The Valley?
I don't like the sound of this.

938
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,708
-Hey, wait, this doesn't make sense.
-'Sup?

939
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:57,041
Okay, that's a Spider, but that's an Uber.

940
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,916
Those are Southerns, and…

941
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,958
Yeah, that's an Eastern.
You can tell by his fangs in the front.

942
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,833
Ain't Bloods and Crips.
It's the Valley. They cross-pollinate.

943
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,500
No, these vamps would never
choose to live together.

944
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,375
Ubers are solo-nesters.

945
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:11,875
Spiders cohabitate,
but never with Easterns and Southerns.

946
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,250
-They'd steal their food.
-Listen to this kid. Huh?

947
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:17,416
This joker reads a few books,
he thinks he knows more than the pros.

948
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,416
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Kid makes a good point.

949
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,333
-But…

950
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,833
But I'm outta time. I gotta go
pick up the little one. Come on.

951
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:28,666
Pull these fangs. And why don't you
go to the bathroom and dry off your dick.

952
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:37,125
You okay?

953
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:40,375
I don't know.

954
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,666
I just keep thinking about
how all those vampires we just killed

955
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,458
used to be regular people.

956
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,458
There you go.

957
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:52,208
The old vampires-are-just-like-us routine.

958
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:54,000
But they're not, Seth.

959
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:58,083
You know what I see when I see a vamp?
Big old dollar signs.

960
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:01,250
'Cause all they are
is murderers and liars.

961
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,416
It ain't Brad Pitt in a leather jacket
and some blood raves.

962
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,041
It's not Eclipse. It's not New Moon.
It's not Breaking Dawn Part One.

963
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:10,500
It ain't like that, all right?

964
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,708
Why do you know the names
to all the specific Twilight films?

965
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,791
What's your gripe
with Breaking Dawn Part 2?

966
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:18,375
It's the exciting conclusion
of the whole Twilight Saga.

967
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:20,833
Wha… Have you seen Part 2?

968
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:23,333
Bella has her baby now. It's insane.

969
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:26,166
-She had the baby?
-Oh, I wish I was you!

970
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,875
To experience that the first time.
You're in for a treat.

971
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:31,708
My daughter hipped me to all that.
I don't really get into all that.

972
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,666
But you got something different, Seth.

973
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,416
You're tougher than you think you are.

974
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:38,916
No.

975
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:40,458
I'm serious.

976
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:42,750
You're just saying that
so I don't report you to Seeger.

977
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:46,291
No, I'm not. You got what it takes.
I'm telling you. You have that instinct.

978
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:48,166
You could be a real hunter out here.

979
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:50,166
Telling you right now.

980
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,125
Fuck Carol.

981
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:53,625
Fuck accounting.

982
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,375
You could do this.

983
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:08,041
-Hey. Hey!
-Hi, Dad!

984
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:11,083
-Dad? What happened to "Daddy"?
-Little kids say, "Daddy."

985
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:13,125
Oh, is that right? "Dad," huh?

986
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,125
Everything's changing around here.

987
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,166
You're late. Again.

988
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,708
So, what is all this?

989
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:25,208
Well, I can't actually sell the house
without putting it on the market.

990
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:28,750
Yeah. Last I checked,
it's three days until Monday.

991
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:31,166
Come on, Dad.
We're gonna be late to the party.

992
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,458
You know, I was thinking,
what if we don't go?

993
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:37,875
What if we stay here at the house
and eat pizza, some ice cream--

994
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:41,750
Bud. No. She's been talking about this
all week. You promised.

995
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:45,125
Yeah, well, I just didn't think
it was the right time right now.

996
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:46,750
What? Okay, give me a reason why.

997
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,750
Right. So, Daddy was just kidding.
He was just being weird.

998
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,375
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you guys are going to a party!

999
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:58,458
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
-See, Daddy was just being strange.

1000
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,291
-Strange, yeah.
-Yeah.

1001
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:01,625
-Come on.
-Bye.

1002
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:02,833
-Bye, baby.
-Bye.

1003

Hello?

1008
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:22,750
I've been looking for you, Bud.

1009
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:24,666
Who is this?

1010
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,416
Troy spoke so highly of you.

1011
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,500
Your name was the last thing
on his lips when he died.

You know how this ends, don't you?

You tell me.

We gotta go, baby. That's so nice.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,458
Up, up, up.

1024
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,916
Look, buckle yourself in, okay?

1025
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,083
Look, in here, all right.
Now let's put your headphones on, okay?

1026
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:15,416
Got your iPad right here.
Now listen. Dad's gonna be driving.

1027
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,583
You might feel a little swerving,
but that's just my special driving.

1028
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,291
Just pick up, pick up, pick up.

1029
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,916
Can't talk. Meeting a realtor.

1030
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,416
-Don't hang up!
-Why? Is Paige okay?

1031
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,208
-Uh, yeah, she's great, but, uh…

1032
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:00,083
Look, Joss, we're in trouble, okay?
All of us.

1033
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,666
What? What are you talking about?

1034
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,250
There's a lot I need to tell you.

1035
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,916
I know you've had trouble
trusting me in the past.

1036
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,750
I know you think I keep things from you,
but right now, you gotta trust me.

1037
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,916
-I don't want to lose either of you.
-Now you're freaking me out.

1038
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,208
Pack your bags, be ready to go,
and I will explain everything, okay?

1039
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:20,500
-A bag?

1040
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:21,791
All right.

1041
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,791
Hey. You took your headphones off, huh?

1042
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,750
I already won my race.
Besides, looks like you can use my help.

1043
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,750
Uh, you're not wrong on that.

1044
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,208
Light!

1045
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,208
-Whoa!

1046
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:47,458
Car!

1047
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,416
Thank you!

1048
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:41,916
All right, big jump. Big jump!

1049
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,750
Woo-hoo!

1050
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:47,166
There's a guy on the right!

1051
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,000
Hold on.

1052
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:14,958
Cover your ears, sweetie.

1053
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,958
That was awesome.

1054
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:43,916
Yeah? Just don't tell your mother.

1055
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:55,500
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

1056
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:58,750
Come on. All right. Come on. Let's run.

1057
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:01,291
-You ever heard of Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
-Uh, no.

1058
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:03,125
-I'll show her to you.
-Okay.

1059
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:09,125
-No! No! No!

1060
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:11,208
No!

1061
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:14,583
No, no, no! Stop!

1062
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,333
Hola, Bud.

1063
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:21,041
I told you you'd be on your knees
begging for their lives.

1064
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,250
It's okay. It's okay.

1065
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,458
So beg.

1066
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,250
-Go to hell.
-Oh, your compadre said the same thing.

1067
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:30,125
Oh shit. Baby, I'm sorry.

1068
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:32,375
I'm sorry for this, Joss. Are you okay?

1069
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,333
Yeah.

1070
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,083
What is happening, Bud?

1071
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:38,416
I could try to explain it right now,
but it's not gonna make any sense.

1072
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,250
-But--
-But what?

1073
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:44,666
I'm not exactly a pool cleaner.

1074
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,208
Well, then, what are you?

1075
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,083
I…

1076
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,000
hunt vampires.

1077
01:14:53,916 --> 01:14:56,166
-What?
-Yeah. I hunt vampires.

1078
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,416
-Vampires?
-Yeah. That's what I do.

1079
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:01,166
-Vampires?
-Yeah.

1080
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:06,416
Okay, so all of the lies, all of
the late-night calls, all of the locks…

1081
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,541
Come on, man.

1082
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,416
The reason I'm separated
from the man I love is vampires? Ow!

1083
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,875
Stop choking her like that!

1084
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:15,375
Come on, Bud. We said
we were gonna be honest with each other.

1085
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:16,416
We are.

1086
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:19,958
-I know. Don't look at it.
-Oh my God!

1087
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:21,916
-Listen…

1088
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,166
I wanted to tell you.
I just didn't know how.

1089
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,666
Okay. Okay, so…

1090
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:30,541
Uh, what do you want?

1091
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:31,625
What do I want?

1092
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,625
You and your daughter.

1093
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:38,291
-They're not a part of this!
-Pendejo, you made them a part of it!

1094
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,750
-Don't touch me!
-Don't touch her!

1095
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:44,958
I'm not afraid of you.

1096
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,375
Such a brave muñeca.

1097
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:48,291
Take them.

1098
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,333
-No! No!
-No, don't touch her!

1099
01:15:50,416 --> 01:15:52,708
-Leave her alone! Get your hands off her!
-Don't touch her!

1100
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:54,041
I'll come get you!

1101
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:55,458
-Daddy!

1102
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:58,458
-I'mma fix all of this. I love y'all!
-Cálmate, Bud.

1103
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,958
A new day is dawning,

1104
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:02,333
and your little girl's
gonna be a part of it.

1105
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:03,583
Get off of me.

1106
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:08,458
First, I'm gonna turn her,

1107
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,583
and then I'm gonna watch
as she drinks your wife.

1108
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:15,083
I wish
you could be there to see it,

1109
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,875
but I'm afraid
someone's having you for dinner.

1110
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:39,500
Daddy!

1111
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:49,041
Oh, I'm alive.

1112
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,666
Oh, Bud.

1113
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:54,416
Oh!

1114
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,375
Oh, I feel weird.

1115
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,208
Yeah, I bet… I bet you do.

1116
01:16:58,291 --> 01:16:59,708
What happened to me?

1117
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:02,916
Just some bullshit. You know how shit go.

1118
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,125
But, uh…

1119
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:07,416
-You probably wanna… check your teeth.

1120
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,583
Check my teeth?

1121
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:11,041
Yeah, just check them.
There's a mirror over there.

1122
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,125
Oh…

1123
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,583
Oh! Oh no!

1124
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,750
Oh no. Oh, that's not good.

1125
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:23,208
-What! That was totally involuntary.
-It's like a hiccup, probably.

1126
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:26,458
-I'm sorry, man, it was all my fault.

1127
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,541
How you feel?

1128
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:30,791
Pretty horrified
about the fact that I'm a vampire.

1129
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,625
-Right. Right.
-But also like…

1130
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,708
-I don't know, kind of amazing.
-Yeah, like--

1131
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:37,541
Like my blood, it just…
it feels like it's on fire--

1132
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,916
Like you had, like,
a lot of energy drinks.

1133
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,083
Oh, I can smell everything!

1134
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:46,083
Oh God, did I shit myself this time?

1135
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:47,500
No, no, no, you look fine.

1136
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,541
-Is there like a mark?
-No, you look good.

1137
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:50,958
Everything looks great.

1138
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,791
Listen, let's just take it easy.

1139
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:54,875
-We're gonna work this out.

1140
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:56,041
Oh wow.

1141
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,250
Mainly I just…

1142
01:17:57,958 --> 01:17:59,208
Whoa, I just feel

1143
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:00,583
hungry!

1144
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,416
Goddamn it, Seth.

1145
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:11,541
I'm sorry, kid.

1146
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:13,708
I'm actually gonna miss you, man,
you know?

1147
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:16,041
It's crazy how
you get attached to someone.

1148
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,208
Oh shit.

1149
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,166
Bud?

1150
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,708
Huh?

1151
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:25,750
You cut my head off.
I thought we were friends.

1152
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,958
I… You rushed me.

1153
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,541
It's just reaction. That's what I do.

1154
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:34,291
It's in my blood. It's like…
You ever see Tyson? He…

1155
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,833
You don't walk up on Tyson either.

1156
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,000
Friendship is complicated, huh?

1157
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:42,916
Yeah, friendships are complicated.

1158
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,208
All right, wait. Follow my voice.
Left, there. Yep, okay.

1159
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:48,458
Easy. No. Okay, easy, easy.

1160
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,083
Okay, here we go.

1161
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,166
The fuck?

1162
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:53,916
Okay, gentle.

1163
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:56,083
Gentle.

1164
01:18:58,375 --> 01:18:59,708
Huh. Still fits.

1165
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,083
Wha…

1166
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,333
Oh, it's been quite the week.

1167
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:09,666
Yeah, it has. You good?

1168
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:12,375
-How do I look?
-You look all right.

1169
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:14,041
-You feel all right?
-You swear?

1170
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,083
-Yeah.

1171
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:17,416
-Hey!
-Sorry. Just kidding.

1172
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,458
-Okay. All right.
-Too soon. Too soon. All right.

1173
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,666
Hey, I'm sorry I tried to eat you.

1174
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,916
How 'bout we not report this
to Seeger until Monday?

1175
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,625
Seeger, shit. Oh, what?
You don't think he's gonna notice?

1176
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:33,083
What, am I just supposed to
wear turtlenecks from now on?

1177
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:37,000
I mean, I do look good in a T-neck,
but that's not sustainable.

1178
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:40,916
-Wait. Where are we going?
-Going to get my family back.

1179
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,333
I have to stop at my place
and get some information.

1180
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:46,583
What's going on with your neck?
Is it repairing itself?

1181
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:48,708
I actually think it is.

1182
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:50,916
Okay, just be careful.
Don't go over any speed bumps.

1183
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,000
Damn. Damn.

1184
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,750
My bad.

1185
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:05,375
You have a driving problem.
You know that, right?

1186
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,166
I gotta go to apartment 19.

1187
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:09,041
I'll be back in five.

1188
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,708
Heather, you just moved in.
Leaving so soon?

1189
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:20,875
Bud, just listen to me.

1190
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:24,458
Look, we need to talk.

1191
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,958
Talk? Vampires kidnapped my family.
You wanna talk?

1192
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:29,166
-I didn't have a choice.
-I don't give a rat's ass.

1193
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,708
This is stupid, Bud.
Let me at least explain.

1194
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:49,916
Okay, listen.

1195
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,541
Because of you, my family got kidnapped,
and my friend is dead.

1196
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:55,000
Or undead.

1197
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,833
So I don't want no problems, I just…

1198
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:01,000
That's what she does, Bud.

1199
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:03,708
-She turns people against their will.

1200
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:07,208
I wasn't even a familiar.
She just… just did this to me.

1201
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:09,166
You think I wanna
work for a monster like her?

1202
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,583
Then why do you?

1203
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,166
-She's my maker, okay?
-What?

1204
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,250
And an Uber Vamp.

1205
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:20,083
Look, she forced me to get close to you.

1206
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:22,250
She wanted to get back at you
for what you did to her.

1207
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:23,333
What you talking about?

1208
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:27,916
She just…
She just wanted to know how to hurt you.

1209
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:28,958
Why?

1210
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,833
So, you just gonna
light your finger on fire, huh?

1211
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:46,291
You killed a vampire Monday, didn't you?

1212
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,666
-Sweet old lady?
-Not so sweet, actually.

1213
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,416
That was Audrey's daughter.

1214
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:54,708
Daughter? How?

1215
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:57,750
When she came over, she had
a little girl she had to leave behind.

1216
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:01,458
So by the time they went back,
found her, and turned her, she was old.

1217
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,833
-And I killed her.
-And you killed her.

1218
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,791
And now they got Paige and Jocelyn.

1219
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:06,958
I'm sorry.

1220
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:10,500
-Hey, Bud. I don't feel so good.

1221
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:13,250
Could you hold my head for a little?

1222
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:17,791
Holy shit.

1223
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:26,666
You're walking on sacred ground.
You should be honored.

1224
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:28,791
Where are you taking us?

1225
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:31,375
-Why, are you frightened?
-No.

1226
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:32,291
You should be.

1227
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:34,625
Well, then you don't know me
that well, bitch. Ah!

1228
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:38,166
Why are you doing this?

1229
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,541
Paige, don't talk to her.

1230
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,916
She has a right to know.

1231
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,916
You don't get to decide--

1232
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:49,916
I had a daughter once, feisty like you.

1233
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,458
I wanted to make a better world for her.

1234
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:55,375
A world where
she could be free from hiding.

1235
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:58,375
But your father took that away from me.

1236
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,708
Now, you see,
it's only fair I take you away from him.

1237
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:04,541
-If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

1238
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:06,291
But I'm already dead.

1239
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,083
I'm not gonna hurt her, Ms. Jablonski.

1240
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:12,541
I'm gonna make sure
no one can ever hurt her again.

1241
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,875
-You should thank me.

1242
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:16,416
A war is coming,

1243
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,125
and your little girl's
gonna be on the winning side.

1244
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:21,625
-No!
-Paige!

1245
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,708
Let me go!

1246
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:26,541
No. No!

1247
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,166
-Come on.

1248
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:40,916
-Seth, hold your head still.

1249
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:43,583
Looks like they've turned him
with Uber blood,

1250
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:45,583
so he'll be unpredictable for a while.

1251
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:47,583
He'll get under control eventually.

1252
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:51,000
Here.

1253
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:53,208
No, I'm pescatarian.

1254
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,291
Come on.

1255
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,458
-Mm. Mmm!
-There we go.

1256
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Mmm.

1257
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:01,916
You hunters are always
complaining about LA running dry.

1258
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,916
That's what Audrey's trying to change.

1259
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,750
It's, like, sweet but a little tangy.

1260
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:08,750
That's nice.
Oh yeah, get inside of me.

1261
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:11,666
She uses her cover as a realtor
to buy properties all over the Valley

1262
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,166
and move vamps
back in amongst the rest of us.

1263
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,125
Within a year, all vamp activity in LA

1264
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:18,625
will be traceable
to her sitting at the top.

1265
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,250
Not if I get to her first.

1266
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:21,958
I'll lead the way.

1267
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:24,958
-All right, I'm coming too.
-No, no, no. No. Hell no, Seth.

1268
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:27,375
You got too much energy now.
You fresh off some blood.

1269
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:30,000
I don't want you to switch up on me,
try to bite my kidneys out.

1270
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:31,541
No, Bud, listen. They tortured me.

1271
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:34,583
Okay, they drank my blood.
They cut my head off.

1272
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:39,041
I guess technically, you cut my head off,
but they turned me into this, okay?

1273
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:41,083
-I want to help take her down.
-Okay.

1274
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:44,083
We'll get you changed,
head back to my spot, and we'll gear up.

1275
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:46,333
-Oh, right now?
-Yeah, right now.

1276
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:48,833
What? It's dark out.
That's a suicide mission.

1277
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:52,333
Welcome to the motherfucking night shift.

1297
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,875
Bud, what do we do?
We're surrounded.

1298
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,125
Black Cowboy.

1299
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,125
Get down.

1300
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,125
How the hell you get here?

1301
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:45,583
The snowflake.

1302
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,666
I might have texted him.

1303
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:50,500
-Welcome to the fucking Union, brother.
-Thank you.

1304
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:53,000
-Hey, hey, if you don't get your ass off--
-Oh. Sorry.

1305
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:54,041
-This way.
-Sorry.

1306
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:55,166
Come on, Big J.

1307
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:56,083
After you.

1308
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:09,333
Bud, in the back, look for the staircase.
That's the entrance to her tunnel.

1309
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:11,250
Keep going down, and you'll find her.

1310
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,791
There's a faster way down,
but you wouldn't survive it.

1311
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:15,125
We survive everything.

1312
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,958
See me fighting a bear,
you pour honey on me.

1313
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,583
You two go ahead. We'll catch up.

1314
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:25,583
Come on. Let's get cracking.

1315
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:58,000
Just like old times.

1316
01:28:58,083 --> 01:28:59,125
I'm out.

1317
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:03,166
Look at this shit here. Jackpot.

1318
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,833
Man, look at all this gear.

1319
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:07,833
Okay.

1320
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:13,041
Ugh. Shit, look at this.
All this sunscreen.

1321
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:16,208
Vamps runnin' around in the day.
She could take over the Valley.

1322
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:20,791
Handle him, J!

1323
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:22,583
Okay.

1324
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:24,291
-Oh shit.

1325
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:27,041
I see you. He didn't know, did he?

1326
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,041
He didn't know.

1327
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,250
-Whoo! Get him, J.

1328
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,458
Stay down, fool.

1329
01:29:35,541 --> 01:29:38,208
Yo. You did that
without even stretching, huh?

1330
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:41,875
That was my weak leg.

1331
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,625
See all this? Huh?

1332
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:46,333
All these guns?

1333
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:49,583
Check it out.
Silver-tipped wooden bullets.

1334
01:29:49,666 --> 01:29:50,791
Vampire killers.

1335
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:52,041
What's that about?

1336
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:54,375
Is she El Jefe?

1337
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,458
Nah. El Jefe is bigger than this, brother.

1338
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:59,666
But, either way,
that bitch got an ass-whooping coming.

1339
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:01,791
Yeah.

1340
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,833
Yeah, they down here.

1341
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:19,291
Let's get cracking.

1342
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:20,791
Just like old times.

1343
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,208
He's coming.

1344
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:29,000
I can smell him.

1345
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:33,833
I don't know how all this works,
but I know my husband,

1346
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:36,000
and he's gonna murder you.

1347
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:38,666
-Ex-husband.
-See, now you're just being a bitch.

1348
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,666
{\an8}Bring him to me.

1349
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:43,708
Paige.

1350
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:55,541
-This place ain't creepy at all.
-Tell me about it.

1351
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,333
Here we go.

1352
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:30,166
Bud!

1353
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:41,083
Jablonski…

1354
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,666
John!

1355
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:15,041
That's how we do, baby.

1356
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:18,083
You know how we do.
We bag 'em, and we tag 'em.

1357
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,500
That's how we get it done.

1358
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:21,666
-What's going on with you?

1359
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:24,291
Ain't nothing going on.
Ain't nothing wrong with me, man.

1360
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:27,208
-You all right?
-Shit. You know they can't fuck with me.

1361
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:28,750
Okay, but why you leaning like that?

1362
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,041
We been battle-tested.
This don't mean nothing.

1363
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:32,916
-All right.
-Nothing but a flesh wound, dog.

1364
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,583
Okay. Still, it don't look too good.
Come on, let's get up out of here.

1365
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:41,166
Come on. We ain't got much time.
Gotta get you out of here. Come on, man.

1366
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:45,291
Come on!

1367
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:49,333
-Big John, what the hell is you doing?
-I'm saving your Black ass.

1368
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:50,500
What are you talking about?

1369
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:52,500
Go get your family right now. I got this.

1370
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:55,000
-We can't do it like this.
-You know I work alone.

1371
01:32:55,958 --> 01:32:57,666
-You crazy motherfucker.
-Go.

1372
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,416
-You better stay alive.
-Go!

1373
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:02,166
I'll be here waiting for you!

1374
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,375
All right, motherfuckers, come on!

1375
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,000
West side for life!

1376
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:01,333
John…

1377
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:11,916
I'm not supposed to kill you yet,
but you've been a real pain in the ass,

1378
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:13,875
so give me one good reason.

1379
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:14,916
Burn in hell.

1380
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,125
Good enough.

1381
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:37,375
-You're working on that landing, huh?
-No, I planned it like that.

1382
01:34:37,458 --> 01:34:38,583
Go, we've got him.

1383
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:04,458
-No!

1384
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:08,500
Paige! Stay back.

1385
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:10,916
Daddy!

1386
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,250
-Joss, you okay?
-Yeah.

1387
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:16,083
All right. I'll let you go.

1388
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:18,750
A life for a life
or whatever the hell you have.

1389
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,708
You took my daughter, Jablonski.

1390
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:27,541
-I'm just returning the favor.
-No.

1391
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:30,875
-Mommy!
-Baby!

1392
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:34,625
What do you think, muñeca?

1393
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,833
I'm gonna kill your daddy,

1394
01:35:36,916 --> 01:35:39,208
then I'm gonna make you
drink your mean old mommy,

1395
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:42,958
and then I'm gonna be
your new, improved mommy.

1396
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:45,041
-How does that sound?

1397
01:35:45,125 --> 01:35:45,958
I hate you!

1398
01:35:46,666 --> 01:35:48,291
That's not very nice.

1399
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:49,833
I hate you too.

1400
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:02,250
Daddy!

1401
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,041
Ah!

1402
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,416
I should've just got another job.

1403
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,750
Ah!

1404
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:49,166
-Baby, get up!
-Come on, Daddy, get up!

1405
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:50,500
Baby, I'm trying.

1406
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:52,291
-Try harder.
-Oh, okay.

1407
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,958
{\an8}In the end,
the devil comes for everyone.

1408
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:18,750
That's what you get.

1409
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,291
{\an8}Bitch.

1410
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:22,500
No!

1411
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:24,833
Mommy!

1412
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:35,583
Pull!

1413
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:04,708
Wood to the heart, silver to the neck.

1414
01:38:20,416 --> 01:38:22,666
Your last bullet, cabrón?

1415
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,333
No!

1416
01:38:49,083 --> 01:38:50,583
{\an8}Fucking pool boy.

1417
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,583
The best.

1418
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,583
Y'all good?

1419
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,041
Works every time.

1420
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:04,125
Let's go.

1421
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,625
Come on, babe. Let's go.

1422
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:13,916
All right.

1423
01:39:15,666 --> 01:39:17,375
-Hey. Where's Seth?
-Hey.

1424
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:20,041
-Whoa!
-No, no, no. Babe, babe, no.

1425
01:39:20,125 --> 01:39:21,500
They're the good vampires.

1426
01:39:21,583 --> 01:39:24,250
That's my girl Heather.
That's my guy Seth.

1427
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,583
-Hey.

1428
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:26,666
Whose arm is that?

1429
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:28,958
Oh. Sorry.

1430
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:32,333
But, Bud… got my first pair of fangs.

1431
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:33,416
Whoa.

1432
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:35,583
That's big money right there.

1433
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:36,791
-Guess what?
-What's that?

1434
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:38,333
I didn't pee myself this time.

1435
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:41,208
-Get out.
-Vampires don't pee or poop.

1436
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,666
Nah, they don't.

1437
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:47,083
-Please let me have this little victory.
-Of course you can. C'mon. Let's go.

1438
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:51,500
Do they really not pee or poop?

1439
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:54,708
-Does that mean they're full of shit?
-Language!

1440
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:03,791
Big John.

1441
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,250
I'll miss you, baby.

1442
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:14,166
Oh, no.

1443
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,375
Go ahead. Come on.

1444
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:17,708
It's got good energy in that.

1445
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:22,000
All right.

1446
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:25,458
We were hiding right over there.
Right over there.

1447
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:26,875
Jablonski!

1448
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:30,791
Seeger? What the hell you doing,
walking all fast like that?

1449
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,916
New shoe boots on.

1450
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:36,791
And you. What are you, sick?

1451
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,416
-Uh, pink eye.
-What?

1452
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,416
It's when poo particles get in your eye.

1453
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,583
Where's Big John?

1454
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,500
Oh goddamn it!

1455
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:51,958
I did you a solid.

1456
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:55,916
But now you have
graciously returned the favor

1457
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,416
because after the shit
you pulled here tonight,

1458
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,625
I'll never have to deal with you again.

1459
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:02,958
For starters,

1460
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:07,583
flagrantly violating code 682,
operating outside of your shift.

1461
01:41:07,666 --> 01:41:09,041
Actually, sir, if I may.

1462
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:12,916
Code 741 states that,
"If a hunter is in a 911 situation,

1463
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,875
he may circumvent normal operating hours

1464
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:17,833
so long as he notifies the Union
before entering," which he did.

1465
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:19,875
Thank you. Thank you for that.

1466
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:23,625
There's also code 584,
unlawful termination of familiars

1467
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:25,583
without prior authorization.

1468
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:28,375
Yes, sir, that is correct,
but Section 4 states,

1469
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:31,208
"When fired on, a hunter is
lawfully allowed to return fire,"

1470
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:32,625
which is what happened here.

1471
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:37,333
Code 424, "A Union hunter
must make all reasonable efforts

1472
01:41:37,416 --> 01:41:41,375
to limit collateral damage to property
while engaging in a hunt."

1473
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:42,333
Boom!

1474
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:44,416
-Sir, code 42--
-I got this.

1475
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:49,166
Code 424 was rescinded by
the national office in January.

1476
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:51,208
Boom. Boom.

1477
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:53,708
-Someone's been reading.
-Saw it in the newsletter.

1478
01:41:53,791 --> 01:41:55,916
Yeah. I see what's going on here.

1479
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:56,833
Uh-huh.

1480
01:41:57,375 --> 01:41:58,333
Loopholes.

1481
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,458
Think you're smarter than me?

1482
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:04,875
Then you can probably spell "traitor."

1483
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,833
Sure.

1484
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:09,666
T-R-A-I-T-O-R. What was the point of that?

1485
01:42:13,708 --> 01:42:15,916
Carol's keeping her fucking desk.

1486
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,916
Good! She can have it.

1487
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,125
I'm a field man now!
Mowing down vamps with my best friend Bud.

1488
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:27,833
-That felt good.
-You did that.

1489
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:30,125
Wait. Shit. What are you
gonna do about the money?

1490
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:32,000
-Oh, I'm good.

1491
01:42:32,083 --> 01:42:33,750
Think I'm gonna be all right.

1492
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:34,666
And, uh…

1493
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,083
fuck Carol.

1494
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,708
Hey, should I drink Carol?

1495
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:41,291
No, no, that's a lot of cholesterol.

1496
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:42,333
Right, okay.

1497
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:45,041
I won't go out of my way,
but if, like, there's a chance encounter

1498
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:46,500
outside her house at night or…

1499
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,000
-Yeah. Later.
-See you, guys!

1500
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:49,416
-Bye.
-See you, guys.

1501
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:51,916
What about us?

1502
01:42:53,583 --> 01:42:54,666
What about us?

1503
01:42:55,166 --> 01:42:57,666
I was thinking,
what if we tried this whole, you know,

1504
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:59,500
stay on the same groove type thing.

1505
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:01,708
You know, me cooking breakfast. You know?

1506
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:05,458
How about we take it
one day at a time, but no more lies.

1507
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:08,666
After what we've seen tonight,
there is no reason to lie.

1508
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:12,541
So I ask you a question,
and you give me a straight answer.

1509
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:15,208
I can live under those terms, you know.

1510
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:16,125
Okay.

1511
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:18,625
Yeah, I don't think we're there yet.

1512
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:21,000
Mm-hmm. You just gonna leave me like this?

1513
01:43:25,791 --> 01:43:28,333
Mmm. Jump back, want to kiss myself.

1514
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:31,166
I'm gonna be a vampire hunter too.

1515
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:32,541
Uh…

1516
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:33,916
-No.
-No.

1517
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:38,375
-Daddy, why do you call me Pickle?
-Because that's what you are, baby.

1518
01:43:38,458 --> 01:43:41,333
Sometimes you're a sweet pickle,
sometimes you're a sour pickle,

1519
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:43,375
and sometimes you're a salty pickle.

1520
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:44,791
I love you, Daddy.

1521
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:02,750
That's what I love about LA.

1522
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,958
