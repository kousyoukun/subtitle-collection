1
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,490
Hello there, Mr. Neff.

2
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,370
- Working pretty late aren't you, Mr. Neff?
- Late enough. Let's ride.

3
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,330
- You look kind of all in at that.
- I'm fine.

4
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,180
- How's the insurance business, Mr. Neff?
- Okay.

5
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,010
They wouldn't ever sell me any.
They say I've got something loose in my heart.

6
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,860
- Uh-huh.
- I say it's rheumatism.

7
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,260
Twelve.

8
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,040
Office memorandum

9
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,920
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

10
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,960
Los Angeles, July 16th, 1938.

11
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,960
Dear Keyes:

12
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,040
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

13
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,640
I don't like the word confession.

14
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,270
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see

15
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,230
because it was smack up
against your nose.

16
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,520
You think you're such a hot potato
as a claims manager...

17
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,630
such a wolf on a phoney claim.

18
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,330
Well, maybe you are, Keyes

19
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,410
but let's take a look
at this Dietrichson claim

20
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,370
Accident and Double Indemnity.

21
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,450
You were pretty good
in there for a while, Keyes.

22
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,400
You said it wasn't an accident. Check.

23
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,680
You said it wasn't suicide. Check.

24
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,290
You said it was murder.

25
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,570
Check.

26
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,090
You thought you had it cold, didn't you?

27
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,410
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

28
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,250
It was perfect

29
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,220
except that it wasn't,
because you made a mistake

30
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,290
just one tiny little mistake.

31
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,170
When it came to picking the killer,
you picked the wrong guy.

32
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,180
Want to know who killed Dietrichson?

33
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,050
Hold tight to that cheap cigar
of yours, Keyes.

34
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,010
I killed Dietrichson.

35
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,940
Me, Walter Neff

36
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,850
insurance salesman, 35 years old,
unmarried, no visible scars.

37
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,420
Until a little while ago, that is.

38
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,580
Yes, I killed him.

39
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,700
I killed him for money

40
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,980
and a woman

41
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,020
and I didn't get the money and I...

42
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,100
didn't get the woman.

43
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,980
Pretty, isn't it?

44
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,150
It began last May.

45
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,100
About the end of May, it was.

46
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,990
I had to run out to Glendale
to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks.

47
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,580
On the way back I remembered
this auto renewal on Los Feliz Blvd.

48
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,590
So I decided to run over there.

49
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,460
It was one of those California spanish houses
everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago.

50
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,750
This one must have cost somebody
about 30,000 bucks

51
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,630
that is, if he ever finished
paying for it.

52
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,230
- Mr. Dietrichson in?
- Who wants to see him?

53
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,310
- The name is Neff. Walter Neff.
- If you're selling something...

54
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,020
It's Mr. Dietrichson I'd like to talk to,
and it's not magazine subscriptions.

55
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,570
Listen, Mr. Dietrichson's not in.

56
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,610
How soon do you expect him?

57
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,570
He'll be home when he gets here,
if that's any help to you.

58
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,280
- What is it, Nettie? Who is it?
- It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

59
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,230
- I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?
- How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson.

60
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,360
- I'm Walter Neff, Pacific All-Risk.
- Pacific all-what?

61
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,230
Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company.
It's about some renewals on the automobiles.

62
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,390
I've been trying to contact your husband
for the past two weeks.

63
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,930
...but he's never at his office.

64
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,120
Is there anything I can do?

65
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,000
The insurance ran out on the fifteenth.
I'd hate to think of your getting

66
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,870
a smashed fender or something
while you're not fully covered.

67
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,000
Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff.

68
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,160
- I've just been taking a sun bath.
- No pigeons around, I hope...

69
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,450
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson...
I hate to take up your time...

70
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,600
That's all right.

71
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,240
If you can wait till I put something on,
I'll be right down.

72
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,120
Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room.

73
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,370
- Where would the living room be?
- In there, but they keep the liquor locked up.

74
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,200
That's okay. I always carry my own keys.

75
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,080
The living room was still stuffy
from last night's cigars.

76
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,290
The windows were closed
and the sunshine coming in through

77
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,130
the Venetian blinds
showed up the dust in the air.

78
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,530
On the piano, in couple of fancy frames,
were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...

79
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,810
his daughter by his first wife.

80
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,810
They had a bowl of those little red
goldfish on the table behind the davenport,

81
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,200
but, to tell you the truth, Keyes...

82
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,660
I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.

83
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,770
nor in auto renewals, nor in
Mr. Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.

84
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,450
I was thinking about that dame upstairs
and the way she had looked at me

85
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,140
and I wanted to see her again, close
without that silly staircase between us.

86
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,210
- I wasn't long, was I?
- Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

87
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,420
I hope I've got my face on straight.

88
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,020
- It's perfect for my money.
- Neff is the name, isn't it?

89
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,540
With two f's, like in Philadelphia.
If you know the story.

90
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,120
What story?

91
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,900
The Philadelphia Story.

92
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,340
Suppose we sit down and
you tell me about the insurance.

93
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,880
My husband never tells me anything.

94
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,590
It's on your two cars,
the La Salle and the Plymouth.

95
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,820
We've been handling this insurance for 3 years
and we hate to see these policies lapse.

96
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,220
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

97
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,620
As I was saying,
we'd hate to see the policies lapse.

98
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,020
Of course, we give him 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

99
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,620
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

100
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,620
Could I catch him home some evening
for a few minutes?

101
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,770
I suppose so.
But he's never home much before eight.

102
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,880
That would be fine with me.

103
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,400
You're not connected
with the Automobile Club, are you?

104
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,360
No, the All-Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

105
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,660
Somebody from the Automobile Club
tried to get him.

106
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,350
- Do they have a better rate?
- If your husband's a member.

107
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,580
No, he isn't.

108
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,130
Well, he'd have to
buy the membership to start with.

109
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,340
I never knock the other
fellow's merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

110
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,460
The Automobile Club is fine.

111
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,350
I can do just as well for you, though.
I have a very attractive policy here.

112
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,780
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

113
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,670
For instance, we're writing a new kind of
50% retention feature in the collision coverage.

114
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,060
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

115
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,750
I've had 11 years of it.

116
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,270
- Doing pretty well?
- It's a living.

117
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,570
You handle just automobile insurance
or all kinds?

118
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,010
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft...

119
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,720
public liability, group insurance,
industrial stuff and so on.

120
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,370
Accident insurance?

121
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,960
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

122
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,990
I wish you'd tell me
what's engraved on that anklet.

123
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,840
- Just my name.
- As for instance?

124
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,600
- Phyllis.
- Phyllis. I think I like that.

125
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,910
But you're not sure?

126
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,540
I'd have to drive it
around the block a couple of times

127
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,790
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by
tomorrow evening about 8:30 ?

128
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,600
- He'll be in then.
- Who?

129
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,760
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him weren't you?

130
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,640
Yeah I was but I'm only getting
over it a little. If you know what I mean.

131
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,560
There's a speed limit in this state,
Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

132
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,920
- How fast was I going, officer?
- I'd say about 90.

133
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,120
Suppose you get down off
your motorcycle and give me a ticket.

134
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,270
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

135
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,620
Suppose it doesn't take.

136
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,360
Suppose I have to whack
you over the knuckles.

137
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,120
Suppose I bust out crying
and put my head on your shoulder.

138
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,260
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

139
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,960
That tears it.

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,120
- Eight-thirty tomorrow evening then.
- That's what I suggested.

141
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,680
- Will you be here, too?
- I guess so. I usually am.

142
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,330
- Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?
- I wonder if I know what you mean.

143
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,970
I wonder if you wonder.

144
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,330
It was a hard-afternoon and I can still
remember the smell of honeysuckle in that street.

145
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,490
How could I have known that murder
sometimes can smell like honeysuckle...

146
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,210
Maybe you would've known Keyes the minute
she mentioned the accident insurance.

147
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,050
But I didn't. I felt like a million.

148
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,410
I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.

149
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,290
It was the day you had that truck driver
from Inglewood on the carpet. Remember Keyes?

150
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,420
Oh, Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see you.
He's been yelling for you all afternoon.

151
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,850
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

152
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,720
Here, park these for me, sweetheart.

153
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,090
C'mon, Gorlopis. You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

154
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,480
You're in a jam and you know it.

155
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,300
- Sez you. All I want is my money.
- Sez you. All you're gonna get is the cops.

156
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,930
Hello, Walter.
This is Sam Gorlopis from Inglewood.

157
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,170
Sure, I know Mr. Gorlopis.

158
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,580
Wrote a policy on his truck.

159
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,580
- How are you, Mr. Gorlopis?
- I ain't so good. My truck burned down.

160
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,670
Yeah! Now look, Gorlopis.

161
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,060
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

162
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,620
Some of them are phonies, and I know which ones.
How do I know? Because my little man tells me.

163
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,940
- What little man?
- The little man in here.

164
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,780
Every time one of those phonies comes along
he ties knots in my stomach. I can't eat.

165
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,020
And yours was one of them, Gorlopis.
That's how I knew your claim was crooked.

166
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,550
So what did I do?

167
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,370
I sent a tow car out to your garage
this afternoon...

168
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,240
and they jacked up
that burned-out truck of yours.

169
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,510
And what did they find?

170
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,270
They found what was left
of a pile of shavings.

171
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,450
What shavings?

172
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,190
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

173
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,440
Look, mister, I'm just a poor guy.
Maybe I made a mistake.

174
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,320
That's one way of putting it.

175
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,710
- I ain't feelin' so good, Mr. Keyes.
- Sign this and you'll feel fine.

176
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,980
- Sign what?
- Right there. It's a waiver on your claim.

177
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,890
Now you're an honest man again.
Goodbye, Gorlopis.

178
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,720
But I ain't got no more truck.

179
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,630
$2600.
That's a lot of dough where I live.

180
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,630
What's the matter, Gorlopis?
Don't you know how to open the door?

181
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,520
Just put your hand on the knob,
turn it to the left

182
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,630
- pull it toward you... that's the boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

183
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,830
What kind of an outfit is this anyway?

184
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,080
Are we an insurance company,
or a bunch of dimwitted amateurs

185
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,320
- ...writing a policy on a mugg like that?
- Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef.

186
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,120
I clipped a note to that Gorlopis application
to have him thoroughly investigated...

187
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,180
before we accepted the risk.

188
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,640
I know you did, Walter. I'm not beefing at you.
It's the company. The way they do things.

189
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,130
The way they don't do things.

190
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,910
The way they'll write anything
just to get it down on the sales sheet.

191
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,650
And I'm the guy that has to sit
here up to my neck in phony claims

192
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,770
so they won't throw more money out of
the window than they take in at the door.

193
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,960
Okay, turn the record over
and let's hear the other side.

194
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,220
I get darn sick of picking up...

195
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,460
after a gang of fast-talking salesmen
dumb enough...

196
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,180
to sell life insurance
to a guy that sleeps in the same bed...

197
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,690
with four rattlesnakes.

198
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,430
- I've had 26 years of that, and I...
- And you loved every minute of it,
Keyes. You love it.

199
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,330
Only you worry about it too much,
you and your little man.

200
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,010
You're so darn conscientious
you're driving yourself crazy.

201
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,200
You wouldn't even say today is
Tuesday without you looked at the calendar

202
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,690
and then you would check if it
was this year's or last year's calendar

203
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,250
and then you would find out
what company printed the calendar

204
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,250
then find out if their calendar
checks with the World Almanac's calendar.

205
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,970
That's enough from you, Walter.
Get out of here before I throw my desk at you.

206
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,570
I love you, too.

207
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,810
I really did, too, you old crab, always yelling
your fat head off, always sore at everybody.

208
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,370
You never fooled me... not for a second.

209
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,250
The kind I always knew that behind the cigar ashes
on your vest you had a heart as big as a house...

210
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,210
Back in my office there was a phone message
from Mrs. Dietrichson about the renewals.

211
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,540
She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening.

212
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,410
She wanted me to come
Thursday afternoon at 3:30 instead.

213
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,620
I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon,

214
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,370
including a trip down to Santa Monica to see a couple
of live prospects about some group insurance.

215
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,060
But I kept thinking about Phyllis Dietrichson
and the way that anklet of hers cut into her leg.

216
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,580
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

217
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,940
I'm considering it.

218
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,490
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

219
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,870
Last night wasn't so convenient.

220
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,010
That's alright.
I was working on my stamp collection.

221
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,660
I was just fixing some iced tea.
Would you like a glass?

222
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,440
Unless you have a bottle of beer
that's not working.

223
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,430
There might be some.
I never know what's in the ice box. Nettie!...

224
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,870
- About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

225
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,190
- You did?
Yes. He'll renew with you he told me so.

226
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,390
In fact,
I thought he'd be here this afternoon.

227
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,500
- But he's not?
- No.

228
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,220
That's terrible.

229
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,140
Nettie!... Nettie!...
Oh, I forgot, it's the maid's day off.

230
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,190
- Nevermind the beer, ice tea will be fine.
- Lemon? Sugar?

231
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,110
Fix it your way.

232
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,990
Seeing it's the maid's day off
maybe there's something I can do for you.

233
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,730
Like running the vacuum cleaner.

234
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,430
- Fresh.
- I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.

235
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,460
Not much money
but you learn a lot about life.

236
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,480
I didn't think you learned it
from a correspondence course.

237
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,440
Where did you pick up this tea drinking?

238
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,840
- You're not English, are you?
- No. Californian.

239
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,570
Born right here in Los Angeles.

240
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,550
They say native Californians all
come from Iowa.

241
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,400
- Mr. Neff, I.....
- Make it Walter.

242
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,670
- Walter.
- Right.

243
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,040
Tell me, Walter...
how much commission do you make?

244
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,400
20%. Why?

245
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,020
I thought maybe
I could throw more business your way.

246
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,980
I can always use it.

247
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,290
I was thinking about my husband.

248
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,820
I worry a lot about him,
down in those oil fields.

249
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,080
It's very dangerous.

250
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,480
- Not for an executive, is it?
- He doesn't just sit behind a desk.

251
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,040
He's right down there with the
drilling crews. It's got me worried sick.

252
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,320
You mean some dark night
a crown block might fall on him?

253
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,810
- Please don't talk like that.
- But that's the idea.

254
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,400
The other day a casing line snapped
and caught the foreman.

255
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,630
He's in the hospital with a broken back.

256
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,270
It's bad.

257
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,550
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

258
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,350
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband?

259
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,280
It could.

260
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,560
Don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance?

261
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,800
Uh-huh.

262
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,240
- What kind of insurance could he have?
- Enough to cover doctors' and hospital bills.

263
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,440
Say a 100 and 25 a week cash benefit.
And he'd rate around $50,000 capital sum.

264
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,130
- Capital sum? What's that?
- In case he gets killed.

265
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,730
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

266
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,930
I suppose you have to think of everything
in your business.

267
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,040
Your husband would understand.

268
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm sure I could sell him on the idea
of some accident protection.

269
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,390
Why don't I talk to him about it?

270
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,770
- You could try. But he's pretty tough going.
- They're all tough at first.

271
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,060
He's got a lot on his mind.

272
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,520
He doesn't seem to want to
listen to anything...

273
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,830
except maybe baseball on the radio.

274
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,460
Sometimes we sit all evening
without a word to each other.

275
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,880
Sounds pretty dull.

276
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,050
- So I just sit and knit.
- Is that what you married him for?

277
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,260
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

278
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,130
Anytime his thumbs get tired...
with me around you wouldn't have to knit.

279
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,420
Wouldn't I?
- I bet your life you wouldn't.

280
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,540
Why not a little rum
that gets this up on its feet?

281
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,900
I want to ask you something, Walter.

282
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,980
Could I get him an accident policy
without bothering him at all?

283
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,940
How's that again?

284
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,420
That would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

285
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,590
I have a little allowance of my own.
I could pay for it...

286
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,090
and he needn't know anything about it.

287
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,170
Why shouldn't he know?

288
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,460
Because he doesn't want accident insurance.

289
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,140
- He's superstitious about it.
- A lot of people are. Funny, isn't it?

290
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,630
If there was a way to get it
like that, all the worry would be over.

291
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,060
- You see what I mean, Walter?
- Sure. I've got good eyesight.

292
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,950
You want him to have the policy
without him knowing it.

293
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,900
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know.

294
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,710
- That's the set-up, isn't it?
- Is there anything wrong with it?

295
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,030
No, I think it's lovely.

296
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,530
And then, some dark wet night,
if a crown block fell on him...

297
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,310
What crown block?

298
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,470
Only sometimes it can't quite make
it on its own so it has to have a little help.

299
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,060
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block.

300
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,030
It can be a car backing over him,
or he can fall out of an upstairs window.

301
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,270
Any little thing like that,
as long as it's a morgue job.

302
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,590
Are you crazy?

303
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,480
Not that crazy.

304
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,350
- Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
- What's the matter?

305
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,480
Look, baby, you can't get away with it.

306
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,790
- You want to knock him off, don't you.
- That's a horrible thing to say!

307
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,110
Who'd you think I was, anyway?

308
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,870
A guy that walks into a good-looking dame's
front parlor...

309
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,310
and says "Good afternoon,
I sell accident insurance on husbands.

310
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,700
You got one that's been around too long?

311
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,080
Somebody you'd like to
turn into a little hard cash?

312
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,870
Just give me a smile and I'll help you collect."
Boy, what a dope you must think I am!

313
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,260
I think you're rotten.

314
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,050
I think you're swell.
So long as I'm not your husband.

315
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,270
- Get out of here.
- You bet I'll get out of here, baby.

316
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,700
I'll get out of here but quick.

317
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,720
So I let her have it,
straight between the eyes.

318
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,940
She didn't fool me for a minute,
not this time.

319
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,440
I knew I had hold of a redhot poker and the
time to drop it was before it burned my hand off.

320
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,120
I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle
of beer, the one I had wanted all along,

321
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,840
only I wanted it worse now,
to get rid of the sour taste of her iced tea...

322
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,390
and everything that went with it.

323
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,600
I didn't want to go back to the office...

324
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,350
so I dropped by a bowling alley
at Third and Western and rolled a few lines

325
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,250
to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.

326
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,120
I didn't feel like eating dinner
when I left, and I didn't feel like a show

327
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,210
so I drove home, put the car away
and went up to my apartment.

328
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,250
It had begun to rain outside and I watched it
get dark and didn't even turn on the light.

329
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,610
That didn't help me either.

330
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,040
I was all twisted up inside,
and I was still holding on to that red-hot poker.

331
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,290
And right then it came over me
that I hadn't walked out on anything at all,

332
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,930
that the hook was too strong,
that this wasn't the end between her and me.

333
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,730
It was only the beginning.

334
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,470
So at eight o'clock the bell would ring...

335
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,780
and I would know
who it was without even having to think...

336
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,210
as if it was the most natural thing
in the world.

337
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,330
- Hello. You forgot your hat this afternoon.
- Did I?

338
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,140
- Don't you want me to bring it in?
- Sure.

339
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,820
Put it on the chair.

340
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,460
- How did you know where I live?
- It's in the phone book.

341
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,260
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

342
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,140
Peel off your coat and sit down.

343
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,090
Your husband out?

344
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,980
Yes, Long Beach.
They're spudding in a new well.

345
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,020
He phoned he'd be late. About 9:30.

346
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,820
- It's about time you said you're glad to see me.
- I knew you wouldn't leave it like that.

347
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,620
- Like what?
- Like it was this afternoon.

348
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,900
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

349
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,940
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

350
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,740
- Okay.
- It's not okay.
Not if you don't believe me.

351
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,620
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to be nice to me.

352
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,830
- Like the first time you came to the house.
- It can't be like the first time.

353
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,670
- Something has happened.
- I know it has.

354
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,430
It's happened to us.

355
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,990
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares about me. Not any more.

356
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,310
But he keeps me on a leash.
So tight I can't breathe.

357
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,670
- He's in Long Beach, isn't he? Relax.
- Maybe I oughtn't to have come.

358
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,950
- Maybe you oughtn't.
- You want me to go?

359
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,470
- If you want to.
- Right now?

360
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,350
Sure. Right now.

361
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,390
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you, Walter.

362
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,030
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

363
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,670
I don't know.
I bought it down at Ensenada.

364
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,600
We ought to have some of that pink wine
to go with it. The kind that bubbles.

365
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,960
But all I have is bourbon.

366
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,830
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

367
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,200
Get a couple of glasses, will you.

368
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,080
- Soda?
- Plain water, please.

369
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,360
You know, about six months ago...

370
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,020
a guy slipped on the soap in his bathtub...

371
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,200
and knocked himself cold and drowned.

372
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,520
Only he had accident insurance. So they
had an autopsy and she didn't get away with it.

373
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,130
- Who didn't?
- His wife.

374
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,140
There was another case
where a guy was found shot...

375
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,410
and his wife said he was cleaning a gun
and his stomach got in the way.

376
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,050
All she collected
was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

377
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,130
Perhaps it was worth it to her.

378
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,370
See if you can carry this
as far as the living room.

379
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,580
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

380
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,600
A colored woman comes in twice a week.

381
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,130
- Cook your own breakfast?
- I squeeze a grapefruit once in a while .

382
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,800
The rest I get at the corner drugstore.
- It sounds wonderful.

383
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,810
Just strangers beside you.

384
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,730
You don't know them.
You don't hate them.

385
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,400
You don't have to sit across the table...

386
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,280
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

387
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,500
What daughter?

388
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,470
- Oh, that little girl on the piano.
- Mmm. Lola. She lives with us.

389
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,100
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

390
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,620
- Ever think of a divorce?
- He wouldn't give me a divorce.

391
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,130
I suppose
because it would cost him money.

392
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,540
He hasn't got money.
Not since he went into oil business.

393
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,740
But he had when you married him?

394
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,610
Yes, he had. And I wanted a home.
Why not?

395
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,020
But that wasn't the only reason.

396
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,700
I was his wife's nurse.
She was sick for a long time.

397
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,580
When she died,
he was all broken up.

398
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,100
- I.... pitied him so.
- And now you hate him.

399
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,060
Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me.

400
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,650
Every-time I buy a dress
or a pair of shoes he yells his head off.

401
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,710
He won't let me go anywhere.

402
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,380
He keeps me shut up.
He's always been mean to me.

403
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,270
Even his life insurance
all goes to that daughter of his.

404
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,830
- That Lola.
- Nothing for you at all, huh?

405
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,190
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

406
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,060
So you lie awake in the dark
and listen to him snore and get ideas.

407
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,260
Walter, I don't want to kill him.
I never did.

408
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,150
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

409
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,500
- Only sometimes you wish he was dead.
- Perhaps I do.

410
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,390
And you wish it was an accident
and you had that policy. For $50,000.

411
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,350
- Is that it?
- Perhaps that too.

412
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,230
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

413
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,530
When we got into the garage...

414
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,240
he just sat there with his head
on the steering wheel...

415
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,490
and the motor still running.

416
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,470
And I thought what it would be like
if I didn't switch it off

417
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,320
...just closed the garage door
and left him there.

418
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,640
I'll tell you what it would be like...

419
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,060
if you had that accident policy,
and tried to pull a monoxide job.

420
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,310
We have a guy in our office
named Keyes.

421
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,960
For him a set-up like that would be
just like a slice of rare roast beef.

422
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,710
In 3 minutes
he'd know it wasn't an accident.

423
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,880
In 10 minutes
you'd be sitting under the hot lights.

424
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,320
In half an hour
you'd be signing your name to a confession.

425
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,180
But Walter,
I didn't and I'm not going to do it.

426
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,190
Not if there's an insurance company
in the picture, baby.

427
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,210
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

428
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,720
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

429
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,960
They'll hang you as sure as
ten dimes will buy a dollar.

430
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
And I don't want you to hang, baby.

431
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,640
Stop thinking about it, will you.

432
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,920
So we just sat there, and she started
crying softly, like the rain on the window

433
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,360
and we didn't say anything. Maybe she had
stopped thinking about it, but I hadn't.

434
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,410
I couldn't. Because it all tied up with
something I had been thinking about for years

435
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,200
since long before I ever ran into
Phyllis Dietrichson.

436
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,840
Because, in this business you can't sleep
for trying to figure out the tricks...

437
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,350
they could pull on you.

438
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,990
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

439
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,790
watching the customers to make sure
they don't crook the house.

440
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,890
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

441
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,360
And do it smart. Because you've
got that wheel right under your hands.

442
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,650
And you know every notch in it by heart.

443
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,450
And you figure all you need
is a plant out in front

444
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,010
a shill to put down the bet.

445
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,350
And suddenly the doorbell rings...

446
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,800
and the whole set-up is right there
in the room with you.

447
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,250
Look, Keyes,
I'm not trying to whitewash myself.

448
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:52,140
I fought it, only...
I guess I didn't fight it hard enough.

449
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,010
The stakes were $50,000,
but they were the life of a man, too

450
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,530
a man who'd never done me any dirt,
except...

451
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,410
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about

452
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,340
and I did...

453
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,690
Will you phone me?

454
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,060
Walter!

455
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,940
I hate him. I loathe going back to him.
You believe me, don't you, Walter?

456
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,340
Sure I believe you.

457
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,450
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

458
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,030
You're not going to hang, baby.

459
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,290
It's better than going on this way.

460
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,230
...because you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

461
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,780
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Sure I know what I'm saying.

462
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,140
We're gonna do it and we're gonna
do it right. And I'm the guy that knows how.

463
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,740
- Walter, you're hurting me.
- There isn't going to be any slip up.

464
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,620
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.
It's got to be perfect.

465
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,960
Call me tomorrow.

466
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,620
But not from your house.
From a booth.

467
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,360
And watch your step.
Every single minute.

468
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,950
It's got to be perfect, understand.
Straight down the line.

469
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,830
Straight down the line.

470
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,240
That was it Keyes.

471
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,680
The machine reels started the movement
and nothing could stop it.

472
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,390
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

473
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,280
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

474
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,320
So I had to make him sign
without his knowing what he was signing.

475
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,920
And I wanted a witness besides Phyllis
to hear me give him a sales talk.

476
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,040
I was trying to think with your brains, Keyes.
I wanted all the answers ready for all the...

477
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,280
questions you were going to spring
as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

478
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,440
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

479
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,380
Everything looked fine...

480
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,840
except I didn't like the witness
Phyllis had brought in.

481
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,760
It was Dietrichson's daughter Lola

482
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,490
and it made me feel a little queer
in the belly to....

483
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,210
have her sitting right there
in the room, playing Chinese checkers,

484
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,490
as if nothing was going to happen.

485
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,170
I suppose you realize, Mr. Dietrichson,
that, not being an employee,

486
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,330
you are not covered by
the State Compensation Insurance Act.

487
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,930
The only way you can protect yourself
is by having a personal policy of your own.

488
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,130
Yeah! I know all about that.
The next thing you'll tell me

489
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,010
I need earthquake insurance
and lightning insurance and hail insurance.

490
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,820
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

491
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,740
we'd stay broke
paying for it, wouldn't we, honey?

492
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,650
What keeps us broke is you going out
and buying five hats at a crack.

493
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,580
Who needs a hat in California?

494
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,010
Dollar for dollar, accident insurance
is the cheapest coverage you can buy.

495
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,170
Maybe some other time, Mr. Neff.
I had a tough day.

496
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,130
Just as you say.

497
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,020
Suppose we just settle
that automobile insurance tonight.

498
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,980
Sure.

499
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,690
All we need on that is for you
to sign an application for renewal.

500
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:28,650
Phyllis, mind if we don't finish this game?
It bores me stiff.

501
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,570
- Got some thing better to do?
- Yes, I have.

502
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,380
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

503
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,740
Run along where? Who with?

504
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,060
- Just Anne. We're going roller skating.
- Anne who?

505
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,860
- Anne Matthews.
- It's not that Nino Zachetti again?

506
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,920
It better not be that Zachetti guy.
If I ever catch you with that...

507
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,220
It's Anne Matthews, I told you.
I also told you we're going roller skating.

508
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,730
I'm meeting her at the corner
of Vermont and Franklin

509
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,250
the north-west corner,
in case you're interested.

510
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,790
And I'm late already.

511
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,140
I hope that is all clear. Father.

512
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,340
- Good night, Phyllis.
- Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

513
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
- Oh, I'm sorry. Good night, Mr...
- ...Neff.

514
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,260
Good night, Mr. Neff.

515
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,420
A great little fighter for her weight.

516
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,020
- Now if you just sign these,
Mr. Dietrichson.
- Sign what?

517
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,460
The applications for your auto renewals.

518
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,600
So you'll be covered
until the new policies are issued.

519
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,180
- When will that be?
- In about a week.

520
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,070
- Just so I'm covered when I drive up North.
- San Francisco?

521
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,470
- Palo Alto.
- He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff.

522
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,030
- And he still goes to his class reunion every year.
- What's wrong with that?

523
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,860
- Can't I have a little fun even once a year?
- Great football school, Stanford.

524
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,310
- Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?
- Left guard. Almost made the varsity, too.

525
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,190
- Where do I sign?
- Bottom line.

526
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,030
- Both copies, please.
- Sign twice, huh?

527
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,970
One is the agent's copy.
I need it for my files.

528
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:45,180
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

529
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,750
Thank you, Mr. Dietrichson.

530
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,230
No hurry about the check.
I can pick it up at your office some morning.

531
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,630
- How much you taking me for?
- One forty-seven fifty.

532
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,960
- I guess that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.
- Plenty.

533
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,280
Bring me some soda when you come up, Phyllis.
Good night, Mr. Neff.

534
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,240
- Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.
- I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

535
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,400
Good night, Mr. Neff.

536
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,680
- All right, Walter?
- Fine.

537
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,000
- He signed it, didn't he?
- Sure he signed it. You saw him.

538
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,710
Listen. That trip to Palo Alto
When does he leave?

539
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,290
End of the month.

540
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,440
- He drives, huh?
- He always drives.

541
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,160
- Not this time.
You're going to make him take the train.
- Why?

542
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,680
Because it's all worked out
for a train. Listen, baby.

543
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,050
There's a clause in every accident policy,
a little something called double indemnity.

544
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,800
The insurance companies put it in
as a sort of come-on for the customers.

545
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,120
It means they pay double
on certain accidents.

546
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,920
The kind that almost never happen.

547
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,970
Like for instance
if a guy got killed on a train

548
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,490
- they'd pay a $100,000 instead of $50,000.
- I see.

549
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,930
We're hitting it for the limit, baby.
That's why it's got to be a train.

550
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,360
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

551
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:08,250
Straight down the line.

552
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,860
Hello, Mr. Neff.

553
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,690
It's me.

554
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,100
- Anything wrong?
- I've been waiting for you.

555
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,030
For me? Why?

556
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,060
I thought you could drive me,
if you're going my way.

557
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,740
- Which way would that be?
- Down the hill. Down Vermont.

558
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,620
Oh, sure. Vermont and Franklin.
North-west corner, wasn't it?

559
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,490
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

560
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,530
- Roller skating, eh?
You like roller skating?
- I can take it or leave it.

561
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,420
Only tonight you're leaving it?

562
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,740
Yes, I am.

563
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,010
I'm having a very tough time at home.

564
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,770
My father doesn't understand me
and Phyllis hates me.

565
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,340
- That does sound tough, all right.
- That's why I have to lie sometimes.

566
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,500
- You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin?
- It's Vermont and Franklin all right.

567
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,780
Only it's not Anne Matthews.

568
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,700
It's Nino Zachetti.

569
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,700
- You won't tell on me, will you?
- I'd have to think it over.

570
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,860
Nino's not what my father says at all.
He just had bad luck.

571
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,740
He was doing pre-med at U.S.C. and working
nights as an usher in a theater downtown.

572
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,140
He got behind in his credits and flunked out.

573
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,100
Then he lost his job for talking back.

574
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,150
He's so hot-headed.

575
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,400
That comes expensive, doesn't it?

576
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,730
I guess my father thinks
nobody's good enough for his daughter

577
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,030
except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil.
I wish he'd see it my way.

578
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,990
I can't give Nino up.

579
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,510
It'll straighten out all right,
Miss Dietrichson.

580
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,710
I suppose it will sometime.

581
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,670
This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

582
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,470
Nino! Over here Nino!

583
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,030
- This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
- Hello, Nino.

584
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,350
- The name is Zachetti.
- Nino. Please.

585
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,910
Mr. Neff gave me a ride from the house.
I told him all about us.

586
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,470
- Why does he have to get told about us?
- We don't have to worry about Mr. Neff, Nino.

587
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,610
I'm not worrying.
Just don't you broadcast so much.

588
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,140
What's the matter with you, Nino?

589
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,400
- He's a friend.
- I don't have any friends.

590
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,680
And if I did,
I like to pick them myself. C'mon!

591
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,180
Look, sonny, she needed the ride
and I brought her along.

592
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,810
Is that anything to get tough about?

593
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,880
All right, Lola, make up your mind.
Coming or not?

594
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,480
Of course I'm coming.

595
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,720
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
Thanks a lot. You're awfully sweet.

596
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,360
She was a nice kid

597
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,440
and maybe he was a little
better than he sounded.

598
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,720
But right then it gave me a nasty feeling
to be thinking about them at all

599
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,160
with that briefcase right behind
my head and her father's signature in it.

600
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,570
And what that signature meant.

601
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,690
He was a dead pigeon.

602
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,520
It was only a question of time,
not much time at then.

603
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,840
You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?

604
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,320
That's the place Phyllis
and I had picked for a meeting place.

605
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,210
I already had most of the plan in my head,
but a lot of details had to be worked out.

606
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,560
And she had to know them
all by heart, when the time came.

607
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,050
We had to be very careful from now on.

608
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,650
We couldn't let anybody
see us together.

609
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,610
We couldn't even talk
to each other on the telephone.

610
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,970
Not from her house
or at my office anyway.

611
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,850
So she used to be in the market
every morning about 11 o'clock buying stuff.

612
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,930
And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.

613
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,810
Sort of accidentally on purpose.

614
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,660
- Walter, I ....
- Not so loud.

615
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,470
I wanted to talk to you
ever since yesterday.

616
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,440
Let me talk first.

617
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,810
It's all set. The accident policy
came through. I've got it in my pocket.

618
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,530
I got his check too.

619
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,710
I saw him down in the oil fields.

620
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,540
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

621
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,570
The check's just made out
to the company. It could be for anything.

622
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,340
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see.

623
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,340
It's all right that way,
because one of the cars is in your name.

624
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,220
Quick, open your bag.

625
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,540
- Can you get into his safe deposit box?
- Yes. We both have keys.

626
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,780
Fine. But don't put the policy in there yet.
I'll tell you when.

627
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,900
- And remember, you never touched it
or even saw it, understand?

628
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,180
- I'm not a fool.
- Okay. When is he taking the train?

629
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,420
- That's just it. He isn't going.
- What?

630
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,400
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
The trip is off.

631
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,360
What's happened?

632
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,360
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

633
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,770
That one up there!

634
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:47,030
I don't know why they always have
to put what I want on the top shelf.

635
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,230
Go ahead. I'm listening.

636
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,840
He had a fall down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

637
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,420
- Broke his leg?
- What do we do, Walter?

638
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,020
- Nothing. Just wait.
- Wait for what?

639
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,540
Until he can take a train.
I told you it's got to be a train.

640
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,650
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

641
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,580
We won't grab a hammer and do it quick,
just to get over it.

642
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,850
There are other ways.

643
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,510
Only we're not going to do it other ways.

644
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,770
But we can't leave it like this.
What do you think would happen...

645
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,180
if he found out about this accident policy?

646
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,380
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death-house.

647
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,850
Don't ever talk like that.

648
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,580
Just don't let's start losing our heads.

649
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,120
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.

650
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,160
Excuse me.

651
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,170
We're going to do it right.
That's all I said.

652
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,900
It's the waiting that's getting me.

653
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,150
It's getting me just as bad, baby.
But we've got to wait.

654
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,990
Maybe we have, Walter. Only...

655
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,190
it's so tough without you.

656
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,150
It's like a wall between us.

657
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,040
I better go baby.
I'm thinking of you every minute.

658
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,840
After that a full week went by
and I didn't see her once.

659
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,390
I tried to keep my mind off her
and off the whole idea.

660
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,260
I kept telling myself that maybe those fates...

661
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,970
they say watch over you had gotten together

662
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,110
and broken his leg to give me a way out.

663
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,200
Then it was the 15th of June.

664
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,000
You may remember that date, Keyes.

665
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,720
You came into my office around 3
in the afternoon...

666
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,090
Hello, Keyes.

667
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,320
I just came from Norton's office.

668
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,720
The semi-annual sales records are out.
You're high man, Walter.

669
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,690
- That's twice in a row. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

670
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,400
How would you like a cheap drink?

671
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,160
How would you like a $50 cut in salary?

672
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,610
Do I laugh now,
or wait until it gets funny?

673
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,430
I'm serious, Walter.
I've been talking to Norton.

674
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:28,730
There's too much stuff piling up on my desk.
Too much pressure on my nerves.

675
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,810
I spend half the night walking up and down in my bed.
I've got to have an assistant.

676
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,000
- I thought that you...
- Me? Why pick on me?

677
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,250
Because I've got a crazy idea
you might be good at the job.

678
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,880
That's crazy all right.
I'm a salesman.

679
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,210
Yeah. A peddler,
a glad-hander, a back-slapper.

680
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,170
- You're too good to be a salesman.
- Nobody's too good to be a salesman.

681
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,050
Phooey. All you guys do is ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

682
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,170
- What's troubling you is that 50 buck cut, isn't it?
- That'd trouble anybody!

683
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,610
Look, Walter. The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

684
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,850
It takes more guts
than there is in 50 salesman.

685
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,180
It's the hottest job in the business.

686
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,240
It's still a desk job.
I don't want to be nailed to a desk.

687
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,690
A desk job. Is that all you can see in it?

688
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,650
Just a hard chair to park your pants on
from nine to five.

689
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,470
Just a pile of papers to shuffle around...

690
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,760
and five sharp pencils
and a scratch pad to make figures on

691
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,650
maybe a little doodling on the side.

692
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,770
That's not the way I see it, Walter.

693
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,050
To me a claims man is a surgeon

694
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,940
and that desk is an operating table,
and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels.

695
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,020
And those papers are not just forms
and statistics and claims for compensation.

696
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,660
They're alive!

697
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,540
They're packed with drama!
With twisted hopes and crooked dreams.

698
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,500
A claims man, Walter,
is a doctor and a blood-hound and a....

699
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,140
Who?

700
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,450
Okay, hold on a minute.

701
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,780
A claims man is a doctor and
a blood-hound and a cop and a judge

702
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,260
and a jury and a father confessor,
all in one.

703
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,540
And you want to tell me you're not interested.
You don't want to work with your brains.

704
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,530
All you want to work with
is your finger on a doorbell.

705
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,010
For a few bucks more a week.

706
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,500
There's a dame on your phone.

707
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,770
Walter Neff speaking.

708
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,490
I had to call you, Walter.
It's terribly urgent.

709
00:42:54,630 --> 00:43:00,380
- Are you with somebody?
- Yes I am. Can't I call you back... Margie?

710
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,220
I've only got a minute. It can't wait.

711
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,910
Listen. He's going tonight. On the train.

712
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,780
- Are you listening? Walter!
- Yeah I'm listening, Margie.

713
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,940
Only uh... make it snappy will you?

714
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,980
He's on crutches.
The doctor says he can go if he's careful.

715
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,100
The change will do him good.

716
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,350
It's wonderful, Walter.
Just the way you wanted it. On the train.

717
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,190
- Only with the crutches
it's ever so much better, isn't it?
- Yeah!

718
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,710
One hundred percent better.

719
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,900
Hold the line, will you?

720
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,960
Keyes, suppose I join you in your office

721
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,440
It's alright. I'll wait.
Only tell her not to take all day.

722
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,070
- Go ahead.
- It's the 10:15 from Glendale. I'm driving him.

723
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,950
Is it still that same dark street, isn't it?
The signal is three honks on the horn.

724
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,990
- Okay, anything else?
- No. Oh...

725
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,800
- What color did you pick?
- Blue. Navy blue.

726
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,230
And the cast on his left leg.

727
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,400
- That suits me fine.
- This is it, Walter.

728
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,390
I'm shaking like a leaf.

729
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:58,620
But it's straight down the line
now for both of us.

730
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,840
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

731
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,440
- Sorry, Keyes.
- What's the matter?
The dames chasing you again? Or still?

732
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,830
- Or is it none of my business?
- If I told you it was a customer...

733
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,520
Margie! I bet she drinks from the bottle.

734
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

735
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,850
Why don't you, for instance?

736
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,120
- I almost did, once. A long time ago.
- Now look, Keyes, I've got a call on prospect.

737
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,910
We even had the church picked out,
the dame and I.

738
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,140
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

739
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,760
And I was on my way out
to the jewerly store to buy the ring.

740
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,760
Then suddenly that little man in here
started working on me.

741
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,120
So you went back
and had her investigated.

742
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,160
Yeah. And the stuff that came out.

743
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,570
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was sixteen.

744
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,000
And there was a manic-depressive
in her family on her mother's side.

745
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,840
And she already had one husband

746
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:43,750
He was a professional pool player in Baltimore.
As for her brother...

747
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,720
I get the general idea.

748
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,480
- She was a tramp from a long line of tramps.
- Yeah. All right. What am I to say to Norton?

749
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,640
- How about that job I want you for?
- I don't think I want it, Keyes.

750
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,810
- Thanks, just the same.
- Fair enough.

751
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,450
Only get this:

752
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,330
I picked you for the job,
not because I think you're so darn smart

753
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,240
but because I thought
you were a shade less dumb...

754
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,730
than the rest of the outfit.

755
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,690
Guess I was wrong. You're not smarter,
Walter. You're just a little taller.

756
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:30,500
Yes, Keyes. Those fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.

757
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,500
Now they had thrown the switch.
The gears had meshed.

758
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,450
The time for thinking had all run out.

759
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,100
I wanted my movements accounted
for up to the last possible moment.

760
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,980
So when I left the office I put my rate book
on the desk as if I had forgotten it.

761
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,500
That was part of the alibi.

762
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,180
From here on there was a question
of following the time table. Move by move.

763
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,820
I got home about seven
and drove right into the garage.

764
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,700
This was another item to establish my alibi.

765
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,020
- Hiya there, Mr. Neff.
- Hello Charlie.

766
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,520
How about giving the heap a wash?

767
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,100
How soon you want it?
I got a couple of cars ahead of you.

768
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,500
- Anytime you get to it, Charlie.
I'm staying in tonight.
- Okay.

769
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,380
Up in my apartment I called Lou Schwartz,
one of the salesmen that shared my office.

770
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,380
He lived in Westwood. That made it a toll call
and there'd be a record of it.

771
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,810
I told him
I had forgotten my rate book...

772
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,740
and needed some dope
on the public liability bond I was figuring.

773
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,910
I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.

774
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,990
Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures...

775
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,550
I stuffed a hand towel
and a roll of adhesive tape into my pockets

776
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,550
so I could make it look like
a cast on a broken leg.

777
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,480
Next I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...

778
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,760
so that it would fall down
if the bell rang.

779
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,550
That way I'd know if anybody had called
while I was away.

780
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:50,030
Then I did the same thing to the doorbell
in case anybody came to see me.

781
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,030
I left the apartment by the service stairs.
Nobody saw me.

782
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,110
I walked all the way from
my apartment to the Dietrichson house.

783
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,290
I didn't want to take the bus
because there was always a chance...

784
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:02,480
that someone might remember seeing me on it.

785
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,950
I was being that careful.

786
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,890
I could smell that honeysuckle again,

787
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,330
only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.

788
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,080
I slipped the garage door open
as quietly as I could.

789
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,040
She backed the car in,
just the way I told her to.

790
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,920
I figured it was safer that way, in case he got
into the car before she drove it up.

791
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,960
I got into the back of the car.

792
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,640
I laid there on the floor and waited.

793
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,520
All the time I was thinking about that dark street
on the way to the station, when I was to do it.

794
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,840
and the three honks on the horn
that were to be the signal...

795
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,230
About ten minutes later they came down.

796
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,040
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

797
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,920
I'll have the car out in a second.

798
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,800
- Take it easy, honey.
We've got lots of time.
- Yeah.

799
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,840
Remember what the doctor said.

800
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,260
If you get careless you might end up
with a shorter leg.

801
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,970
So what? I could break the other one
and match them up again.

802
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,720
Makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

803
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,120
It's only for four days.
I'll be back Monday at the latest.

804
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,460
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

805
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,780
What are you doing that for?

806
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,660
What are you honking the horn for?

807
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,720
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

808
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,490
Don't worry.

809
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,910
Keep them away from me as you can.
I don't want help.

810
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,250
I said don't worry, Walter.

811
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,920
You start just as soon as the train leaves.

812
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,320
When you get to the dairy turn off
the highway onto the dirt road.

813
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:34,840
From there it's exactly 8/10
of a mile to the dump beside the tracks.

814
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,680
- Remember?
- I remember everything.

815
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,640
You don't want any cops
stopping you with him in the back.

816
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,940
Walter, we've been through all that
so many times!

817
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,150
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

818
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,320
I'll be back in the observation platform.
I'll drop off as close to the spot as I can.

819
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,920
Let the train pass,
then blink your lights twice.

820
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,700
San Francisco train, lady?

821
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,470
Car 9, section 11.
Just my husband going.

822
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,360
Car 9, section 11.
This way please.

823
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,490
Thank you.
My husband doesn't like to be helped.

824
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,830
Car number 8 up there.

825
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,040
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

826
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,650
Here's the tickets.
Take good care of yourself with that leg.

827
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,000
Yeah, you take it easy driving home.

828
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,870
I'll miss you, honey.

829
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,840
Section 11, suh.

830
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,770
- All aboard!
- Thank you.

831
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:38,650
Good bye, honey.

832
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,410
Good luck, honey!

833
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,810
- Can you make up my berth right away?
- Yes, sir.

834
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,700
I'm going back
to the observation car for a smoke.

835
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,080
Right this way, sir.

836
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,500
You'd like a chair?

837
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,380
No thanks, I'd rather stand.

838
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,420
- You going far?
- Palo Alto.

839
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,080
My name's Jackson.
I'm going to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

840
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,050
Uh-huh.

841
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,670
Had a broken arm myself once.

842
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,730
That darn cast sure itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

843
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,970
I thought I'd go crazy with mine.

844
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:57,820
Palo Alto's a nice little town.
You a Stanford man?

845
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,490
I eh... used to be.

846
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:03,970
Oh-oh.... I bet you left something behind.
I always do.

847
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,940
My cigar case.

848
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,270
Must have left it in my overcoat
back in the section.

849
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,510
Would you care to roll yourself a cigarette,
Mr...?

850
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,910
Dietrichson. No, thanks.
I really prefer cigar.

851
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,440
Maybe the porter could....

852
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,870
Well, I could get it for you.
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.

853
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,010
Oh, if it's not too much trouble.
Car 9, section 11.

854
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:25,780
Car 9, section 11. A pleasure.

855
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,960
Okay. This is got to be fast.

856
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,130
Take his hat and pick up
the crutches back in the tracks.

857
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:44,450
Okay, baby. That's it.

858
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,300
All right, let's go.

859
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,550
On the way back
we went over once more...

860
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,060
what she was to do
at the inquest, if they had one

861
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,540
and about the insurance,
when that came up.

862
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,510
I was afraid she might go to pieces a little,
now that we had done it,

863
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,860
but she was perfect.

864
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:04,820
No nerves. Not a tear,
not even a blink of the eyes...

865
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:08,540
She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.

866
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,460
Walter!

867
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,350
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

868
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,390
It's straight down the line, isn't it?

869
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,470
- I love you, Walter.
- I love you, baby.

870
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:43,150
It was two minutes past 11
as I went up the fire stairs again.

871
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,670
Nobody saw me this time either.

872
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,910
In the apartment I checked the bells.
The cards hadn't moved.

873
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,430
No calls. No visitors.

874
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,640
Then I changed my clothes again.

875
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,110
That left one last thing to do.

876
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,470
I had to go down to the garage.

877
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:02,270
I wanted Charlie to see me again.

878
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,390
You going to use your car after all?
I'm not quite through.

879
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:11,010
Oh. It's all right, Charlie.

880
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,070
Just going up the drug store
for something to eat.

881
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,180
Working upstairs all evening.
My stomach's getting sore.

882
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,820
Yes, Mr. Neff.

883
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,440
That was all there was to it.

884
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,980
Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked

885
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,880
there was nothing to give us away.

886
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,960
And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down
the street to the drug store

887
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,320
suddenly it came over me
that everything would go wrong.

888
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,680
It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true so help me:

889
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,560
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.

890
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,930
It was the walk of a dead man.

891
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,170
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes

892
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,890
and the next day was worse,
when the story broke in the papers

893
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,600
and they started talking about it
at the office

894
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,090
and the day after that
when you started digging into it.

895
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,890
I kept my hands in my pockets
because I... thought they were shaking

896
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,210
and I put on dark glasses
so people couldn't see my eyes

897
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:13,040
and then I took them off again so people
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

898
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,810
I was trying to hold myself together,
but...

899
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,690
I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces....

900
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:24,370
- Oh, Walter.
- Hello, Keyes.

901
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,530
- Come along, the big boss wants to see us.
- That Dietrichson case?

902
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,810
- Must be.
- Anything wrong?

903
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:31,710
The guy's dead,
we had him insured...

904
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,400
and it's going to cost us dough.
That's always wrong.

905
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:35,750
What have you got so far?

906
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,510
Autopsy report.
No heart failure, no apoplexy...

907
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,570
...no predisposing medical cause
of any kind.

908
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,490
He died of a broken neck.

909
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:43,480
When is the inquest?

910
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,600
They had it this morning.
His wife and daughter made the identification.

911
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,450
The train people and some passengers told
how he went through to the observation car...

912
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:54,340
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict, accidental death.

913
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,620
What do the police figure?

914
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,440
That he got tangled up in his crutches
and fell off the train.

915
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,020
They're satisfied.
It's not their dough.

916
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,220
Come on, Walter.

917
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:09,100
All right, thank you very much, gentlemen.
I believe the legal position is now clear.

918
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,740
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

919
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:15,620
Come in, Mr. Keyes!
You too, Mr. Neff.

920
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,050
You find this an uncomfortably warm day
Mr. Keyes?

921
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,500
Sorry, Mr. Norton.
I didn't know this was formal.

922
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,500
Sit down, gentlemen.
Any new developments?

923
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,980
I just talked to this Jackson
long distance, Medford, Oregon.

924
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,550
Who's Jackson?

925
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:31,170
The last man that saw Dietrichson alive.

926
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,770
They were out on the observation platform
together talking.

927
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,470
Dietrichson wanted a cigar and Jackson went
to get Dietrichson's cigar case for him.

928
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:39,940
When he returned to the
observation platform, no Dietrichson.

929
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,680
Jackson didn't think anything was wrong...

930
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,770
until a wire caught up with the train
at Santa Barbara.

931
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,390
They had found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

932
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,820
Very interesting, about the cigar case.

933
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,810
- Anything else?
- Not much.

934
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,670
Dietrichson's secretary says
she didn't know anything about the policy.

935
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:54,920
There is a daughter.

936
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,410
but all she remembers is Neff
talking to her father...

937
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,470
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

938
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,780
I couldn't sell him at first.

939
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,280
Mrs. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

940
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,510
Later on I saw him in the oil fields
and closed him.

941
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:08,390
He signed the application and gave me his check.

942
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,200
A fine piece of salesmanship that was, Mr. Neff.

943
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,480
There's no sense in pushing Neff around.
He's got the best sales record in the office.

944
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,830
Are your salesmen supposed to know that
the customer is going to fall off a train?

945
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:21,690
Fall off a train?
Are we sure Dietrichson fell off the train?

946
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,740
I don't get it.

947
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,080
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

948
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,030
Then what do you think of this case?
This policy might cost us a great deal of money.

949
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,880
It contains a double indemnity clause.
What's your opinion?

950
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,330
No opinion at all.

951
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,310
Not even a hunch?
One of those interesting hunches of yours?

952
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:36,460
Nope. Not even a hunch.

953
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,280
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes.
I've formed a very definite opinion.

954
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,920
I think I know...
in fact I know I know what happened.

955
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,360
You know you know what?

956
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,040
I know it was not an accident.

957
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,810
- What do you say to that?
- Me?

958
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,800
You've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

959
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:01,330
There's a widespread feeling
that just because a man has a large office...

960
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,490
Yes?... Have her come in, please.

961
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,680
There's a widespread feeling
that just because a man has a large office

962
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,890
he must be an idiot.

963
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,610
- I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.
- Oh.

964
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,490
No, no.
I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

965
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:16,880
Mrs. Dietrichson.

966
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,490
Thank you very much for coming,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

967
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,410
I assure you I appreciate it.

968
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,000
- This is Mr. Keyes.
- How do you do.

969
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,330
- How do you do.
- And Mr. Neff.

970
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:32,880
- I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.
- Mrs. Dietrichson, won't you sit down?

971
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,090
May I extend our sympathy
in your bereavement.

972
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,130
I hesitated before asking you
to come here so soon after your loss.

973
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,780
But now that you're here
I hope you won't mind...

974
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,360
if I plunge straight into business.

975
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,210
You know why we asked you
to come, don't you?

976
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,070
No. All I know is
that your secretary made it sound very urgent.

977
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,000
Your husband had an accident policy
with this company.

978
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,840
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

979
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,490
No. I remember some talk at the house
but he didn't seem to want it.

980
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:56,020
He took it out a few days later,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

981
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,830
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

982
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,880
His safe deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

983
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,980
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

984
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,420
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

985
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,840
you are being subjected to
any questioning.

986
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:07,500
But there are a few things
we should like to know.

987
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,800
What sort of things?

988
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:11,180
We have the report
of the coroner's inquest.

989
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,330
Accidental death.

990
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,090
We are not entirely satisfied.

991
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:18,310
In fact ...
we are not satisfied at all.

992
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:22,060
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect ...

993
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:25,940
a suicide.

994
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:30,260
- I'm sorry.
Would you like a glass of water?
- Please.

995
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,420
Thank you.

996
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,980
Had your husband been moody
or depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

997
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:47,470
Did he seem to have financial
worries, for instance?

998
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:51,040
He was perfectly alright
and I don't know of any financial worries.

999
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,940
Let us examine this so-called accident.

1000
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:57,180
First, your husband takes out
this policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1001
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,910
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1002
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,870
Do what?

1003
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:03,510
Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone.
He has to be alone.

1004
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,020
He hobbles all the way out
to the observation platform,

1005
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,740
very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a strong reason.

1006
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,990
Once there, he finds he is not alone.
There is a man there.

1007
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:16,830
- What was his name, Keyes?
- His name was Jackson. Probably still is.

1008
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:20,710
So he gets rid of this Jackson
with some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1009
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,830
- And then he is alone. And then he does it.
- Does what?

1010
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:27,710
He jumps. Suicide.
In which case the company is not liable.

1011
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,110
You know that, of course.

1012
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,360
Now we could go to court...

1013
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,700
I don't know anything.
In fact I don't know why I came here.

1014
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,550
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1015
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,510
What I want to suggest
is a compromise on both sides.

1016
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,000
A settlement for a certain sum,
a part of the policy value...

1017
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,150
Don't bother, Mr. Norton.

1018
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,580
When I came in here I had no idea
you owed me any money.

1019
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,660
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1020
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,220
Now you tell me you want to
pay me a part of it, whatever it is.

1021
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,120
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1022
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,440
I don't like your insinuations about my husband
and I don't like your methods.

1023
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,080
In fact I don't like you,
Mr. Norton.

1024
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,720
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1025
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,960
Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1026
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,600
Only you fumbled on the goal line.

1027
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,840
Then you heaved an illegal forward pass
and got thrown for a forty-yard loss.

1028
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,320
Now you can't pick yourself up
cause you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1029
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,180
I haven't eh?

1030
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:19,840
- She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.
- Can we?

1031
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,400
Mr. Norton, the first thing
that hit me was that suicide angle.

1032
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,160
Only I dumped it in the
wastepaper basket just 3 seconds later.

1033
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,200
You ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1034
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,080
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1035
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,420
Mr. Keyes,
I was raised in the insurance business.

1036
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,920
Yeah. In the front office.

1037
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,020
Come on, you never read
an actuarial table in your life, have you?

1038
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,290
I've got ten volumes on suicide alone.

1039
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:46,130
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation, by sex,
by seasons of the year, by time of day.

1040
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:46,880
Suicide, how committed:

1041
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,290
by poisons, by fire-arms,
by drowning, by leaps.

1042
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,610
Suicide by poison,
subdivided by types of poison

1043
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:56,060
such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous,
narcotic, alkaloid, protein, and so forth.

1044
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:58,690
Suicide by leaps,
subdivided by leaps from high places

1045
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:02,570
under wheels of trains, under wheels of trucks,
under the feet of horses, from steamboats.

1046
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:07,410
But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on record,
there's not one single case of suicide...

1047
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,450
by leap from the rear end
of a moving train.

1048
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:12,220
And do you know how fast that train was going
at the point where the body was found?

1049
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:13,770
15 miles an hour.

1050
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:16,010
Now how could anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1051
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,300
with any kind of expectation
of killing himself?

1052
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:22,450
No soap, Mr. Norton.
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1053
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,420
May I have this?

1054
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:32,020
Come on, Walter.

1055
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,540
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1056
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:54,460
I could have hugged you right then
and there, Keyes, you and your statistics.

1057
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,230
You were the only one
we were really scared of

1058
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:00,180
and instead you were almost
playing on our team...

1059
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,070
That evening
when I got home my nerves had eased off.

1060
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:05,020
I could feel the ground
under my feet again,

1061
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,440
and it looked like easy going
from there on it.

1062
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,240
A 100,000 bucks goes safe
for Phyllis and me...

1063
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,690
as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.

1064
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,950
Hello...

1065
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,950
Hello, baby....

1066
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,790
Sure, everything is fine...

1067
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,280
You were wonderful in Norton's office.

1068
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,900
I felt so funny.
I wanted to look at you all the time.

1069
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,030
How do you think I felt, baby?

1070
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,870
- Where are you?
- At the drug store. Just a block away.

1071
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,100
Can I come up?

1072
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,550
Okay. But be careful.
Don't let anybody see you.

1073
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,710
Hello, Keyes.

1074
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,720
- What's on your mind?
- That broken leg.

1075
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,840
The guy had a broken leg.

1076
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,520
- What are you talking about?
- Talking about Dietrichson.

1077
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,720
- He had accident insurance, didn't he?
- Yeah.

1078
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,840
- Then he broke his leg, didn't he?
- So what?

1079
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,880
And he didn't put in a claim.
Why didn't he put in a claim? Why?

1080
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,920
What are you driving at?
- Walter! I had dinner two hours ago.

1081
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,530
- It stuck half way.
- The little man is acting up again.

1082
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,790
There's something wrong
with that Dietrichson case.

1083
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,540
Because he didn't file a claim?

1084
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:42,890
- Maybe he just didn't have time.
- Oh maybe he just didn't know he was insured.

1085
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,830
No. that couldn't be it.

1086
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:48,650
- You delivered the policy personally, didn't you?
- Yeah.

1087
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,280
- And you got his check.
- Sure, I did.

1088
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,650
- Got any bicarbonate of soda?
- No I haven't.

1089
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:58,370
Walter. I've been living
with this little man for 26 years.

1090
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:01,260
He's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1091
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,770
Maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1092
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,760
No. Not suicide.

1093
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,970
But not an accident either.

1094
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,490
What else?

1095
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:10,730
Look, Walter.

1096
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:14,370
A man takes out an accident policy that is worth
a $100,000 dollars if he is killed on a train.

1097
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,140
Then, two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1098
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:20,010
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

1099
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,650
Do you know what
the mathematical probability of that is?

1100
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,290
One out of....
I don't know how many billions.

1101
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,290
And add to that the broken leg.

1102
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:31,210
Now it just can't be the way it looks.

1103
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:34,060
Something has been worked on us.

1104
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:38,610
Such as what?

1105
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:44,500
Murder?

1106
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,380
- Don't you have any peppermint or anything?
- I'm sorry.

1107
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,860
- Soda water?
- No, no, no.

1108
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,770
- Who do you suspect?
- Maybe I like to make it easy for myself,

1109
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,640
but I always tend to
suspect the beneficiary.

1110
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:58,140
- The wife?
- That wide-eyed dame...

1111
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,750
that just didn't know anything
about anything.

1112
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,240
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1113
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,490
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1114
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,600
I don't claim to know how it was worked,
or who worked it,

1115
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,520
but I know that it was worked.

1116
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,940
I've got to get to a drug store.
It feels like a hunk of concrete inside me.

1117
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,340
- Good night, Walter.
- Good night, Keyes.

1118
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:18,220
- See you at the office in the morning.
- Yeah.

1119
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,870
But I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight

1120
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:24,740
if it wasn't for Norton and his
stripe-pants ideas about company policy.

1121
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,670
I'd have the cops after her
so quick her head would spin.

1122
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:31,540
They'd put her through the wringer,
and, brother, what they would squeeze out.

1123
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,950
- Only you haven't got a single thing
to go on, Keyes.
- Not too much.

1124
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:37,560
Just 26 years experience,
all the percentage there is,

1125
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:39,810
and this lump of concrete
in my stomach.

1126
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:46,430
Have you got one of those things?

1127
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:58,710
- Good night, Keyes.
- So long, Walter.

1128
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:14,000
- How much does he know?
- He doesn't know anything.

1129
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,310
It's those stinking hunches of his.

1130
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,490
But he can't prove anything, can he?

1131
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,660
Not if we're careful.
Not if we don't see each other for a while.

1132
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,800
- For how long a while?
- Until all this dies down.

1133
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,080
You don't know Keyes. Once he gets his
teeth into something he never lets go.

1134
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,550
He'll investigate you.
He'll have you shadowed.

1135
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,470
He'll watch you every minute
from now on.

1136
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,560
- Are you afraid, baby?
- Yes, I'm afraid.

1137
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,440
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us.

1138
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,040
We're not the same any more.

1139
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,320
We did it so we could be together, but instead
of that it's pulling us apart. Isn't it?

1140
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,680
- What are you talking about?
- And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1141
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:54,120
Shut up, baby.

1142
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,920
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1143
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:06,570
- Hello.
- Lola Dietrichson.
Don't you remember me?

1144
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,010
- Yes. Of course.
- Could I talk to you,
just for a few minutes?

1145
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:12,720
Somewhere where we can be alone?

1146
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,570
Oh Yeah uh... Come on into my office.

1147
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:24,720
- Is it something about... what happened?
- Yes, Mr. Neff.

1148
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:27,770
It's about my father's death.

1149
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:31,650
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.

1150
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:35,570
Lou, do you mind
if I use the office alone for a few minutes?

1151
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:37,780
It's all yours, Walter.

1152
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:47,930
Look at me Mr. Neff, I'm not crazy,
not hysterical, not even crying

1153
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,380
but I have an awful feeling
that something's wrong.

1154
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,700
And I had that same feeling
once before.

1155
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,970
- When my mother died.
- When your mother died?

1156
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,450
We were up at Lake Arrowhead.

1157
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:03,440
That was six years ago. We had a cabin there.
It was winter and very cold

1158
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:05,930
and my mother was very sick
with pneumonia.

1159
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,660
She had a nurse with her.

1160
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,780
There were just the three of us
in the cabin.

1161
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,980
One night I got up
and went into my mother's room.

1162
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,920
She was delirious with fever.

1163
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,900
All the bed covers were on the floor
and the windows were wide open.

1164
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,260
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1165
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,240
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1166
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,500
Just then I heard a door open
behind me.

1167
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,740
The nurse stood there.

1168
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:32,300
She didn't say a word, but there was
a look in her eyes I'll never forget.

1169
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:38,900
Two days later my mother was dead.

1170
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,300
- Do you know who that nurse was?
- No. Who?

1171
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,090
Phyllis! I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then

1172
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,060
and he wouldn't listen to me.

1173
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,040
Six months later she married him

1174
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,040
and I kind of talked myself out of the idea...

1175
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,640
that she could have done anything like that.

1176
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,820
But now it's all back again,

1177
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,290
now that something has happened
to my father, too.

1178
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:02,150
You're not making sense,
Miss Dietrichson.

1179
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,710
- Your father fell off a train.
- Yes...

1180
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:06,590
and two days before he fell off
that train what was Phyllis doing?

1181
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,020
She was in her room in front of a mirror,
with a black hat on,

1182
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:09,980
and she was pinning a black veil to it...

1183
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,590
as if she couldn't wait
to see how she would look in mourning.

1184
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,800
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1185
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,360
Aren't you just imagining all this?

1186
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,570
I caught her eyes in the mirror
and they had that look in them...

1187
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:21,400
....they had before my mother died.

1188
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:23,410
That same look.

1189
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,680
You don't like your step-mother,
do you?

1190
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,750
Isn't it just
because she is your step-mother?

1191
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,050
I loathe her. Because she did it.

1192
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,910
She did it for the money.
Only you're not going to pay her,
are you, Mr. Neff?

1193
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,950
She's not going to get away with it
this time. I'm going to speak up.

1194
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,770
I'm going to tell everything I know.

1195
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:38,170
You'd better be careful,
saying things like that.

1196
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,190
I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1197
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,760
I'm sorry.

1198
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,920
I didn't mean to act like this.

1199
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,080
All this that you've been telling me...

1200
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:01,000
- who else have you told?
- No one.

1201
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,920
- How about your step-mother?
- Of course not.

1202
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,800
I moved out.
I'm not living at home any more.

1203
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,190
And you didn't tell
that boy-friend of yours? Zachetti.

1204
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:14,780
I'm not seeing him any more.
We had a fight.

1205
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:20,560
- Where are you living now?
- I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood.

1206
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,570
Four walls, and you just sit
and look at them, huh?

1207
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,470
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1208
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,520
So that evening I took her to dinner...

1209
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,720
at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera Street
where nobody would see us.

1210
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:36,050
I wanted to cheer her up..

1211
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:39,400
Next day was Sunday and we went
for a ride down to the beach.

1212
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,490
She had loosened up a bit
and she was even laughing...

1213
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:45,770
I had to make sure she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.

1214
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:48,730
It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.

1215
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:52,610
And I had no chance to talk to Phyllis.
You were watching her like a hawk, Keyes.

1216
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:56,530
I couldn't even phone her for
fear you had the wires tapped.

1217
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:00,850
Monday morning there was a note on my desk
that you wanted to see me, Keyes.

1218
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,930
For a minute I wondered if
it could be about Lola. It was worse.

1219
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:09,850
Outside your door was the last guy
in the world I wanted to see.

1220
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,740
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1221
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:23,540
Hello, Keyes.

1222
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,380
I want to ask you something.

1223
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,540
After all the years we've known each other,
do you mind if I make a rather blunt statement?

1224
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,860
- About what?
- About me.

1225
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,700
Walter, I'm a very great man.
This Dietrichson business.

1226
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,140
It's murder,
and murders don't come any neater.

1227
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:40,820
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into.

1228
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,690
Smart and tricky and almost perfect, but...

1229
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,560
I think Papa has it all figured out...

1230
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:50,070
figured out and wrapped up in tissue paper
with pink ribbons on it.

1231
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,430
Go ahead, I'm listening.

1232
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:52,980
You know what?

1233
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:56,860
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1234
01:15:56,990 --> 01:16:00,310
- He wasn't?
- No, he wasn't.

1235
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:01,140
Now look Walter,

1236
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,770
you can't be sure of killing a man
by throwing him off a train...

1237
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:05,590
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1238
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:08,050
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1239
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:10,010
and then
throw his body on the tracks.

1240
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:12,180
That would mean either killing him
on the train...

1241
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:15,070
or... and this is where
it really gets fancy...

1242
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,070
you kill him somewhere else
and put him on the tracks.

1243
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,950
Two possibilities,
and I personally buy the second.

1244
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:24,950
- You're way ahead of me, Keyes.
- Look, Walter, it was like this.

1245
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:28,830
They killed the guy...
the wife and somebody else...

1246
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:32,160
and then the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson

1247
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:33,750
and then the somebody else jumped off

1248
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,270
and then they put the body on the tracks
where the train had passed.

1249
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:38,230
An impersonation, see.

1250
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,710
And a cinch to work.

1251
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:40,800
Because it was night,

1252
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,430
very few people were about,
they had the crutches to stare at

1253
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,390
and they never really looked at the man at all.

1254
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:48,120
It's fancy all right, Keyes.
Maybe it's a little too fancy.

1255
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,640
Is it? I tell you it fits together
like a watch.

1256
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,110
And now let's see
what we have in the way of proof.

1257
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,780
The only guy that really got a good look
at this supposed Dietrichson...

1258
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:58,640
is sitting right outside my office.

1259
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,480
I took the trouble
to bring him down here from Oregon.

1260
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,480
- Come in, Mr. Jackson.
- Yes sir, Mr. Keyes.

1261
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,760
- These are fine cigars you smoke.
- Two for a quarter.

1262
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,440
- That's what I said.
Did you study those photographs?
- Yes, indeed.

1263
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,480
I studied them thoroughly.
Very thoroughly.

1264
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,420
Did you make up your mind?

1265
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:17,040
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1266
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,480
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our minds...

1267
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,410
Well, you're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry.

1268
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:22,360
Let's have it.

1269
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,200
- Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?
- Yes

1270
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,400
Then my answer is no.

1271
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:30,360
- What do you mean no?
- I mean this is not the man
that was on the train.

1272
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,440
- Will you swear to that?
- I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.

1273
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,680
And if I say it, I mean it,
and if I mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1274
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,140
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1275
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:39,680
Oh, this is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1276
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:41,490
Please to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased indeed.

1277
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:43,210
- How are you?
- Very fine, thank you. Never was better.

1278
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:44,850
Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1279
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:48,200
How would you describe the man
you saw on that platform?

1280
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,730
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man

1281
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:53,850
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1282
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:55,670
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1283
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:57,550
51, according to the policy.

1284
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,850
The man I saw
was nothing like 51 years old.

1285
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:03,450
Of course,
it was pretty dark on that platform

1286
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:05,850
come to think of it,
he tried to keep his back towards me.

1287
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,730
- But I'm positive just the same.
- Thank you, Jackson.

1288
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,650
Of course you understand
this matter is strictly confidential.

1289
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:13,860
We may need you again here
if the case comes to court.

1290
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,440
Any time you need me,
I'm at your entire disposal.

1291
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:18,060
Expenses paid, of course.

1292
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:21,210
Of course.

1293
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:24,450
Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.

1294
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:26,370
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1295
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:30,260
Listen, I'm sending a man named
Jackson to you with an expense account.

1296
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:34,300
Oh, we brought him down here
from Medford Oregon ....

1297
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,250
Uh-huh.

1298
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,460
Oh, take care of his hotel, will you?

1299
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,340
- Ever been in Medford, Mr. Neff?
- Never been up there.

1300
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,410
Do you go trout fishing?

1301
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:46,610
- Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way?
- Nope.

1302
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,780
I don't fish.

1303
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,780
Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1304
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:54,860
- There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis.
- No relation.

1305
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,900
Let me see.
This man's an automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1306
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,550
Very reputable man, too, I'm told.

1307
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:00,740
All right, Mr. Jackson.
Suppose you go down to the cashier's office...

1308
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:03,030
Room 27 on the 11th floor.
They'll take care of your expense account

1309
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,820
- ....and the ticket for the train tonight.
- Tonight?

1310
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,710
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.

1311
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:11,160
There's a very good osteopath here
I want to see before I leave.

1312
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:15,130
Osteopath?
Well, just don't put her on the expense account.

1313
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:20,500
- Well, goodbye, gentlemen.
It's been a pleasure.
- Goodbye.

1314
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:26,180
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1315
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,110
A murder's never perfect.
It always comes apart sooner or later.

1316
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,510
And when two people are involved
it's usually sooner.

1317
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:34,860
We know the Dietrichson dame is in it,
and somebody else.

1318
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,830
Pretty soon we're going to know
who that somebody else is.

1319
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:37,830
He'll show. He's got to show.

1320
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,510
Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet.
Their emotions are all kicked up.

1321
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:43,870
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1322
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,470
They think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1323
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:50,030
But it's not twice as safe.
It's ten times twice as dangerous.

1324
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:52,910
They've committed a murder and that's
not like taking a trolley ride together

1325
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,700
where each one can get off
at a different stop.

1326
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,660
They're stuck with each other.

1327
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,520
They've got to ride all the way
to the end of the line.

1328
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:00,550
It's a one-way trip
and the last stop is the cemetery.

1329
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:04,960
She put in her claim and I'm going
to throw it right back at her.

1330
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,920
Let her sue us if she dares.
I'll be ready for her...

1331
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:17,800
and that somebody else.
They'll be digging their own graves.

1332
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,080
Mrs. Dietrichson?...
This is Jerry's market.

1333
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,570
We just got in a shipment of that English soap
you were asking about.

1334
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,040
Will you be coming by the day?

1335
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,810
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1336
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,120
Hello, Walter.

1337
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:07,010
Come over here.

1338
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:10,920
- What's the matter?
- Everything's the matter.

1339
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,770
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1340
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:16,170
He's sitting back with his mouth watering,
waiting for you to sue.

1341
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,700
He wants you to sue.
But you're not going to.

1342
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,650
What's he got to stop me?

1343
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:20,540
He's got plenty.

1344
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:26,530
He's figured out how it was worked.
He knows it was somebody else on the train.

1345
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,100
He's dug up a witness
he thinks will prove it.

1346
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:30,520
Prove it how?
If he rejects that claim, I have to sue.

1347
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:33,890
Yeah? And then you're in court and
a lot of other things are going to come up.

1348
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:37,650
Like, for instance,
about you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1349
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,330
- What about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson?
- The way she died.

1350
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:43,490
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1351
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:46,180
Lola's been telling you some of her
cockeyed stories. She's been seeing you.

1352
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:47,620
I've been seeing her,
if you want to know.

1353
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:49,580
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1354
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:52,210
She's been putting on an act,
crying all over your shoulder and lying...

1355
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:53,170
Keep her out of this.

1356
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,480
All I'm telling you is
we're not going to sue.

1357
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,490
Because you don't want the money,
even if you could get it?

1358
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,340
Because she's made you feel
like a heel all of sudden.

1359
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,850
It isn't the money any more.
It's our necks.

1360
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:02,300
- We're pulling out, understand.
- Because of what Keyes can do?

1361
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,000
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1362
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,280
It's because of Lola.
What you did to her father.

1363
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,140
You're afraid she might find out some day,
you can't take it, can you?

1364
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,290
I said, leave her out of this.

1365
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:18,520
It's me I'm talking about.
I don't want to be left out of it.

1366
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,480
Stop saying that.
It's just that it hasn't worked out...

1367
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:21,790
...the way we wanted.
We can't go though with it. That's all.

1368
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:22,750
We have gone through with it, Walter.

1369
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:26,600
The tough part is all behind us. We just have
to hold on now and not go soft inside

1370
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,080
...and stick together, close,
the way we started out.

1371
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:30,710
Watch it.

1372
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:50,190
I loved you, Walter. And I hated him.

1373
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:53,630
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1374
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:57,510
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1375
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:00,030
Yeah, and I was the one
that fixed him so he was dead.

1376
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:01,950
Is that what you're telling me?

1377
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,990
And nobody's pulling out.

1378
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:06,590
We went into it together,
and we're coming out at the end together.

1379
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,730
It's straight down the line
for both of us

1380
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:13,310
Remember?

1381
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:19,310
Yes, I remembered.

1382
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,680
Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...

1383
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,480
about that trolley car ride...

1384
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,910
and how there was no way to getting off
until the end of the line...

1385
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,190
where the cementary was.

1386
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:36,040
And I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1387
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,670
They're to put dead people in,

1388
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:44,800
I guess that was the first time I ever
thought about Phyllis that way. Dead, I mean...

1389
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:49,560
and how it would be if she was dead.

1390
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,000
I saw Lola 3 or 4 times that week.

1391
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,040
One night we went up into
the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl...

1392
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:58,760
I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but...

1393
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,130
it was only with her
that I could relax and let go a little.

1394
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:33,370
Why are you crying?

1395
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,720
You won't tell me?

1396
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:38,770
Of course I will, Walter.

1397
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:42,650
I wouldn't tell anybody else but you.
It's about Nino.

1398
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,530
- Zachetti? What about him?
- They killed my father together.

1399
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:50,410
He and Phyllis. He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1400
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:53,060
What makes you say that?

1401
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,210
I've been following him.
He's been to her house, night after night.

1402
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,610
It was Phyllis and him all alone.

1403
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:01,300
Maybe he was going with me
just for a blind.

1404
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:04,380
- And the night of the murder...
- You promised not to talk that way any more.

1405
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:07,900
...he was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at U.C.L.A.

1406
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,580
but he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1407
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:15,010
Sick!

1408
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:17,020
He couldn't show up,

1409
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:20,890
because the train was leaving
with my father on it.

1410
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:28,300
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all just in my mind.

1411
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:32,430
- Sure, it's all in your mind.
- I only wish it were, Walter

1412
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:37,300
...because I still love him.

1413
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,620
Zachetti.

1414
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:45,420
Phyllis and Zachetti.

1415
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:48,190
What was he doing up at her house?

1416
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,990
I couldn't figure that one out.

1417
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:54,340
I tried to make sense
out of it and got nowhere.

1418
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:57,700
But the real brain-twister
came the next day.

1419
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,390
You sprang it on me, Keyes....

1420
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:03,740
after office hours, when you caught
me down in the lobby of the building.

1421
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:07,630
Oh, Walter, just a minute.

1422
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:13,150
- Hello, Keyes.
- Just hang onto your hat, Walter.

1423
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:14,250
What for?

1424
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:18,080
Nothing much.
The Dietrichson case just busted wide open.

1425
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:22,150
- How do you mean?
- The guy showed. That's how.

1426
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:24,550
- What guy?
- The guy who helped to do it.

1427
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:27,150
- The somebody else?
- Mm-hmm.

1428
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:29,750
- No kidding?
- Yeah, she's filed suit against us

1429
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:31,190
and it's okay by me.

1430
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,350
When we get into that courtroom
I'll tear them to pieces - both of them.

1431
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,550
- Come on - I'll buy you a martini.
- No thanks, Keyes.

1432
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,610
With two olives.

1433
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,450
I've got to get a shave and a shoeshine.
I've got a date.

1434
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:43,390
Margie.
I still bet she drinks from the bottle.

1435
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:46,380
They give matches when you buy cigars.
Just ask for them.

1436
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,260
I don't like them.
They always explode in my pockets.

1437
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:49,910
So long, Walter.

1438
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,600
I was scared stiff, Keyes.

1439
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,280
Maybe you were playing
cat-and-mouse with me.

1440
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,720
Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.

1441
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,840
That's what I had to find out

1442
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,720
and I knew where to look...
in your office.

1443
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,970
Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential.

1444
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,680
Dietrichson File.

1445
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,450
With regard to your proposal
to put Walter Neff under surveillance

1446
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:46,490
I disagree absolutely.

1447
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:48,920
I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...

1448
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,570
and he is definitely
placed in his apartment from 7:15 PM on.

1449
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:56,420
In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years,

1450
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:59,010
and I personally vouch for him,
without reservation...

1451
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:08,190
Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...

1452
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:10,470
between Walter Neff
and Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson

1453
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,220
whereas I am now able to report...

1454
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,710
that such a connection has been established
between her and another man.

1455
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,980
This man has been observed
to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...

1456
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:22,480
on the night of
July 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.

1457
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:26,580
We have succeeded in identifying him
as one Nino Zachetti

1458
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:28,770
former medical student, aged 28

1459
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:32,700
residing at Lilac Court Apartments
12281/2 N. La Brea Avenue.

1460
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:37,900
We have checked Zachetti's
movements on the night of the crime

1461
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:41,060
and have found
that they cannot be accounted for.

1462
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,220
I am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration

1463
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:45,310
and it is my belief...

1464
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:49,190
that we already have sufficient evidence
against Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson

1465
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:51,140
to justify police action.

1466
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:53,080
I strongly urge that this whole matter...

1467
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,670
be turned over
to the office of the District Attorney.

1468
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:59,620
Respectfully, Barton Keyes.

1469
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:34,950
Phyllis? Walter.

1470
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:37,550
I've got to see you... Tonight...

1471
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:40,230
Yes, it has to be tonight...

1472
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:42,550
How's eleven o'clock?

1473
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:44,270
Don't worry about Keyes.

1474
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,230
Leave the door on the latch
and put the lights out.

1475
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:50,510
No, nobody's watching the house...
not any more.

1476
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,910
It's just for the neighbors...

1477
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,470
I told you not to worry about Keyes.

1478
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,790
See you eleven o'clock.

1479
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:59,910
Yeah.

1480
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:03,800
Goodbye, baby.

1481
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,960
I guess I don't have to tell you
what I intended to do at eleven o'clock, Keyes.

1482
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:12,960
For the first time I saw a way
to get clear of the whole mess I was in

1483
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,200
and of Phyllis, too, all at the same time.

1484
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,710
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1485
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:22,600
But what I didn't know was
that she had plans of her own.

1486
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:22,730
In here, Walter.

1487
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:38,220
Hello, baby.

1488
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:42,090
- Anybody else in the house?
- Nobody. Why?

1489
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:46,420
- What's that music?
- A radio up the street.

1490
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:56,060
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1491
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,210
We were talking about automobile insurance.

1492
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:02,700
Only you were thinking about murder.

1493
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:06,540
- And I was thinking about that anklet.
- And what are you thinking about now?

1494
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:07,950
I'm all through thinking, baby.

1495
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:12,730
- I Just came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye? Where are you going?

1496
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:15,540
You're the one that's going, baby.
Not me.

1497
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,820
I'm getting off the trolley car right
at this corner.

1498
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:20,530
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1499
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:22,300
All right, I tell you.

1500
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,660
A friend of mine
has got a funny theory.

1501
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,390
He says when two people commit a murder
it's sort of like a riding a trolley car together -

1502
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:31,060
one can't get off without the other.
They're stuck with each other.

1503
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:34,150
They have to go on riding clear
to the end of the line.

1504
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:37,790
- And the last stop is the cemetery.
- Maybe he's got something there.

1505
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,500
You bet he has.

1506
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,110
Two people are going to ride
to the end of the line, all right.

1507
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:45,990
Only I'm not going to be one of them.
I've got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1508
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:51,070
- Just who are you talking about?
- An acquaintance of yours. A Mr. Zachetti.

1509
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:53,280
Come on, baby, I just got into this...

1510
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,820
because I knew a little something
about insurance, didn't I?

1511
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:57,190
I was a sucker.

1512
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,540
I'd have been brushed-off
as soon as you got the money.

1513
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,100
Nobody wanted to brush you off.

1514
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,480
Save it. I'm telling this...

1515
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:05,380
- It's been you and that Zachetti guy all along,
hasn't it?
- That's not true.

1516
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:09,950
It doesn't make any difference
whether it's true or not.

1517
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:13,870
The point is Keyes believes Zachetti
is the guy he's been looking for.

1518
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:16,370
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what happened to him.

1519
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:18,580
And what's happening to me all this time?

1520
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,830
Don't be silly, baby.

1521
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:28,760
What do you think is going to happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1522
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:32,470
That's what Keyes thinks. And what's good enough
for Keyes is good enough for me.

1523
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:36,360
Maybe it's not good enough for me, Walter.
Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1524
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,670
- Maybe I'd rather talk.
- Sometimes people are where they can't talk.

1525
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,520
Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1526
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,250
And if it was you, they'd just charge it up
to Zachetti, wouldn't they?

1527
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,440
Sure they would.

1528
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,260
That's just what's going to happen, baby.

1529
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,660
Because he's coming here, tonight...
in about 15 minutes.

1530
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,880
With the cops right behind him.

1531
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:58,560
It's all taken care of.

1532
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:01,850
- And that'd make everything lovely for you,
wouldn't it?
- Right.

1533
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,320
And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial

1534
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:05,890
and Lola gets a chance to sound off

1535
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:09,130
and they trip you up on the stand,
and you start to fold up and drag me down with you.

1536
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,050
Maybe I had Zachetti here so
they won't get a chance to trip me up.

1537
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:14,490
- So we can get that money and be together.
- That's cute. Say it again.

1538
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:16,240
He came here the first time just
to ask where Lola was.

1539
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,640
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1540
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:20,050
He's crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered.

1541
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:22,430
I kept hammering into him
that she was with another man,

1542
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:25,720
so he'd get into his jealous rage
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1543
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:28,290
And you know
what he'd have done to her,

1544
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:29,360
- don't you, Walter?
- Yeah.

1545
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:33,970
And for once I believe you.
Because it's just rotten enough.

1546
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:37,410
- We're both rotten.
- Only you're just a little more rotten.

1547
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:40,970
You got me to take care of your husband
for you and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola

1548
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:42,890
and maybe take care of me too

1549
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:45,860
and then somebody else would have come
along to take care of Zachetti for you.

1550
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:47,440
That's the way you operate isn't it, baby?

1551
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,900
Suppose it is. Is what you've cooked up
for tonight any better?

1552
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:54,850
I don't like this music anymore.

1553
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:58,740
Do you mind if I close the window?

1554
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:18,620
You can do better than that,
can't you baby?

1555
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:22,460
Better try again!

1556
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,740
Maybe if I came a little closer?

1557
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:39,140
How's this?
Do you think you can do it now?

1558
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:50,070
Why didn't you shoot again, baby?

1559
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:57,940
Don't tell me it's because you've been
in love with me all this time.

1560
01:35:58,030 --> 01:36:01,550
No. I never loved you, Walter.
Not you, or anybody else.

1561
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:04,710
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1562
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:08,150
That's all you ever meant to me....

1563
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:10,830
...until a minute ago.

1564
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:14,710
When I couldn't fire that second shot.

1565
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:18,510
I didn't think anything like that
could ever happen to me.

1566
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,000
I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.

1567
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,320
I'm not asking you to buy.
Just hold me close.

1568
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:32,830
Goodbye, baby.

1569
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,240
Zachetti!

1570
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:30,130
Come here!

1571
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:36,730
I said come here.

1572
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:38,260
The name is Neff.

1573
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:41,290
Yeah? And I still don't like it.
What do you want?

1574
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:45,570
Look, kiddo,
I want to give you a present.

1575
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:48,410
- Here's a nice new nickel.
- What's the gag?

1576
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:51,120
Suppose you go back down the hill
to a store and make a call.

1577
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:53,090
Keep your nickel
and buy yourself an ice cream cone.

1578
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:57,390
Number Granite 0386.
Ask for Miss Dietrichson, first name Lola.

1579
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:58,720
She isn't worth a nickel.

1580
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:01,330
And if I ever talk to her,
it's not going to be over any telephone.

1581
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:03,880
Tough, aren't you?
Take the nickel and call her. She wants you to.

1582
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:05,710
She doesn't want any part of me.

1583
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,090
I know who told you that,
and it's not true.

1584
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:10,340
She's in love with you.
She always has been.

1585
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,070
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1586
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:16,780
Here. Granite 0386,
go on and call her.

1587
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:20,650
Go on! That way.

1588
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:31,650
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1589
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,620
It's cold.

1590
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:38,180
I wonder if she's still
lying there alone in that house

1591
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:41,820
or whether they've found her by now.

1592
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:45,700
I wonder a lot of things,
but they don't matter any more

1593
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:52,740
except I want to ask you to do me a favor.

1594
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:57,780
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open...

1595
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:02,870
I want you to take care of her
and that guy Zachetti

1596
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:10,950
so he doesn't get pushed around too much.

1597
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:15,220
Hello, Keyes.

1598
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:26,150
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1599
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:30,030
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1600
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:33,030
Or did your little man
pull you out of bed?

1601
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,350
The janitor did.

1602
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,230
Seems you leaked a little blood
on the way in here.

1603
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:43,400
Wouldn't be surprised.

1604
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,310
I wanted to straighten you out
that Dietrichson case.

1605
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,030
So I gather.

1606
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:53,110
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

1607
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:55,990
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1608
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,270
One you didn't quite figure out.

1609
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:01,460
You can't figure them all, Walter.

1610
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:05,400
That's right. You can't, can you?

1611
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:08,840
And now I suppose
I get the big speech

1612
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:12,720
the one with all the two-dollar words in it.

1613
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,720
Let's have it, Keyes.

1614
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,600
Walter, you're all washed up.

1615
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:25,040
Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.

1616
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:28,920
I'm going to call a doctor.

1617
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:32,720
What for? So they can patch me up?

1618
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,610
So they can nurse me along
till I'm back on my feet?

1619
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:38,560
So I can walk under my own power
into that gas chamber up in San Quentin?

1620
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:42,450
- Is that it, Keyes?
- Something like that, Walter.

1621
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:45,160
- Well, I've got a different idea.
- Yeah?

1622
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:47,980
Look, Keyes.
Suppose you went back to bed...

1623
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:51,160
and didn't find these cylinders
till tomorrow morning, when the office opens.

1624
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:54,010
From then on you can play it
any way you like.

1625
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:57,090
Would you do that much for me, Keyes?

1626
01:40:57,130 --> 01:41:00,610
- Give me one good reason.
- I need four hours to get where I'm going.

1627
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:04,450
- You're not going anywhere, Walter.
- You bet I am.

1628
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:05,530
I'm going across the border.

1629
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:09,050
- You haven't got a chance, Walter.
- Good enough to try for.

1630
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:12,930
- You'll never make the border.
- That's what you think.

1631
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:14,930
Watch me.

1632
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:17,210
You'll never even make the elevator.

1633
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:21,100
So long, Keyes.

1634
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:48,020
Hello...

1635
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:51,900
Send an ambulance to the Pacific Building
on Olive Street...

1636
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:55,900
Yeah... It's a police job.

1637
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:17,220
- How you doing, Walter?
- I'm fine.

1638
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:21,790
Only somebody moved the elevator
a couple of miles away.

1639
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:24,700
They're on the way.

1640
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:30,230
You know
why you didn't figure this one, Keyes?

1641
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:32,230
Let me tell you.

1642
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:35,510
The guy you were looking for
was too close.

1643
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:38,270
He was right across the desk
from you.

1644
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:42,150
Closer than that, Walter.

1645
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,870
I love you too.
