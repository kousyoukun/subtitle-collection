1
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:07,639
Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.

2
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:24,093
- Working pretty late, aren't you,
Mr. Neff? - Late enough. Let's ride.

3
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:30,338
- You look kind of all in, at that.
- I'm fine.

4
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:33,867
- How is the insurance business,
Mr. Neff? - Okay.

5
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:36,541
They wouldn't ever
sell me any.

6
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:38,342
They said I have
something loose in my heart.

7
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:41,914
- I say it's rheumatism.
- Yeah?

8
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,047
Twelve.

9
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,463
Office memorandum.

10
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:45,473
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

11
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,971
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

12
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:52,414
Dear Keyes...

13
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:57,009
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

14
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,452
Well, I don't like
the word confession.

15
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,649
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

16
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,419
because it was smack up
against your nose.

17
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:06,687
You think you're such a hot potato
as a Claims Manager...

18
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:08,958
such a wolf on a phony claim.

19
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,968
Maybe you are, but let's take a look
at that Dietrichson claim.

20
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,368
Accident and double indemnity.

21
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:21,404
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

22
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:24,305
You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

23
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:27,148
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

24
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:31,147
You said it was murder. Check.

25
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,814
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

26
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:39,089
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

27
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:40,686
It was perfect.

28
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:44,289
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

29
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:46,267
just one little mistake.

30
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:51,303
When it came to picking the killer,
you picked the wrong guy.

31
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,971
You want to know who
killed Dietrichson?

32
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:58,671
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

33
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:01,674
I killed Dietrichson.

34
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,618
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

35
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,822
35 years old, unmarried,
no visible scars...

36
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:12,085
until a while ago, that is.

37
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:15,224
Yes, I killed him.

38
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,958
I killed him for money...

39
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:20,627
and for a woman.

40
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:26,602
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

41
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:30,438
Pretty, isn't it?

42
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,158
It all began last May.

43
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,624
Around the end of May, it was.

44
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,930
<i>I'd been out to Glendale to deliver</i>
<i>a policy on some dairy trucks.</i>

45
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:58,496
<i>On the way back I remembered this</i>
<i>auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.</i>

46
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:00,508
<i>So I drove over there.</i>

47
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:02,539
<i>It was one of those</i>
<i>California Spanish houses...</i>

48
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:05,513
<i>everyone was nuts about</i>
<i>10 or 15 years ago.</i>

49
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:09,017
<i>This one must've cost somebody</i>
<i>about $30,000.</i>

50
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:11,549
<i>That is, if he ever</i>
<i>finished paying for it.</i>

51
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:15,924
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

52
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:18,517
- Who wants to see him?
- My name is Neff. Walter Neff.

53
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:21,825
- If you're selling something... - Look,
it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...

54
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:23,058
and it's not
magazine subscriptions.

55
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,532
- Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in.
- How soon do you expect him?

56
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:27,796
He'll be home when he gets here,
if that's any help to you.

57
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,599
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

58
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:31,469
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

59
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,634
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.
What is it?

60
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,777
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?

61
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,779
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

62
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:41,010
- Pacific all what? - The Pacific
All Risk Insurance Company.

63
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,074
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

64
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,712
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

65
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:48,951
but he's never in his office.
Is there anything I can do?

66
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:50,515
The insurance ran out
on the 15th.

67
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:52,720
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

68
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:54,422
or something
while you're not...

69
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:55,759
fully covered.

70
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,230
Perhaps I know
what you mean, Mr. Neff.

71
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:03,136
- I've just been taking a sunbath.
- No pigeons around, I hope.

72
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,268
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

73
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,674
Oh, that's all right.

74
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:11,235
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

75
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:14,215
Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

76
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,217
Where would
the living room be?

77
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:20,721
In there, but they keep
the liquor locked up.

78
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,782
It's all right.
I always carry my own keys.

79
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,828
<i>The living room</i>
<i>was still stuffy...</i>

80
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:34,563
<i>from last night's cigars.</i>

81
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:36,598
<i>The windows were closed...</i>

82
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,697
<i>and the sunshine coming in</i>
<i>through the venetian blinds...</i>

83
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:41,004
<i>showed up the dust in the air.</i>

84
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:45,974
<i>On the piano, in a couple of fancy frames,</i>
<i>were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

85
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:48,278
<i>his daughter</i>
<i>by his first wife.</i>

86
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,782
<i>They had a bowl of those</i>
<i>little red goldfish...</i>

87
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:54,254
<i>on the table behind</i>
<i>the big davenport.</i>

88
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:55,685
<i>But to tell you</i>
<i>the truth, Keyes...</i>

89
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:58,784
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested</i>
<i>in goldfish right then.</i>

90
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:02,820
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr. Dietrichson</i>
<i>and his daughter Lola.</i>

91
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:06,800
<i>I was thinking about that dame upstairs,</i>
<i>and the way she had looked at me...</i>

92
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:09,565
<i>and I wanted</i>
<i>to see her again, close...</i>

93
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,369
<i>without that silly staircase</i>
<i>between us.</i>

94
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:20,081
- I wasn't long, was I?
- Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

95
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,641
- Hope I've got my face on straight.
- It's perfect, for my money.

96
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,152
- Neff is the name, isn't it?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:27,519
With two "F's," like in Philadelphia,
if you know the story.

98
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,150
- What story?
- <i>The Philadelphia Story.</i>

99
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:32,384
Suppose we sit down and you tell me
about the insurance.

100
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,952
My husband never
tells me anything.

101
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:38,398
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

102
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:42,861
We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

103
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:45,463
and we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

104
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,675
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

105
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,404
As I was saying, we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

106
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:55,279
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

107
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:57,842
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

108
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,115
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

109
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:02,123
I suppose so. But he's never
home much before 8:00.

110
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,522
That's fine with me.

111
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:05,617
You're not connected
with the Automobile Club, are you?

112
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,095
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

113
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:11,133
Somebody from the Automobile Club
has been trying to get him.

114
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,033
- Do they have a better rate?
- If your husband's a member.

115
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:15,161
No, he isn't.

116
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:18,400
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

117
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:21,170
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

118
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:25,202
The Automobile Club's fine.
I can do just as well for you, though.

119
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:27,476
I have a very attractive
policy here.

120
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,212
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

121
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,846
For instance, we're writing
a new kind of 50% retention feature...

122
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:34,947
in the collision coverage.

123
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,925
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

124
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:40,553
- Well, I've been at it 11 years.
- Doing pretty well?

125
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:41,994
It's a living.

126
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:46,293
You handle just automobile insurance,
or all kinds?

127
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:49,805
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

128
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:52,306
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

129
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,703
Accident insurance?

130
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:56,006
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:01,144
Wish you'd tell me
what's engraved on that anklet.

132
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:04,109
- Just my name.
- As, for instance?

133
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,417
- Phyllis.
- Phyllis, huh?

134
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,888
- I think I like that.
- But you're not sure?

135
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,123
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

136
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:16,926
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by
tomorrow evening around 8:30?

137
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,864
- He'll be in then.
- Who?

138
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:22,165
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

139
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:25,139
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

140
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,572
if you know what I mean.

141
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:30,078
There's a speed limit in this state,
Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

142
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:33,411
- How fast was I going, officer?
- I'd say around 90.

143
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:36,116
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

144
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:38,415
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

145
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,216
Suppose it doesn't take.

146
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:42,655
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

147
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:45,626
Suppose I bust out crying
and put my head on your shoulder.

148
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:48,822
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

149
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:50,388
That tears it.

150
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:58,070
- 8:30 tomorrow evening then.
- That's what I suggested.

151
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,802
- Will you be here, too?
- I guess so, I usually am.

152
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,208
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

153
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,304
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

154
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:08,215
I wonder if you wonder.

155
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:14,287
<i>It was a hot afternoon</i>
<i>and I can still remember...</i>

156
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:17,291
<i>the smell of honeysuckle</i>
<i>all along that street.</i>

157
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:21,591
<i>How could I have known that murder</i>
<i>can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

158
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:22,858
<i>Maybe you would</i>
<i>have known, Keyes...</i>

159
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:26,561
<i>the minute she mentioned</i>
<i>accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

160
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,500
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

161
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:32,470
<i>I went back to the office</i>
<i>to see if I had any mail.</i>

162
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,836
<i>It was the day you had that truck driver</i>
<i>from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

163
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,208
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

164
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,679
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

165
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:41,648
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

166
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,685
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

167
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:45,777
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

168
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,291
- Hello, Walter.
- Hi, George.

169
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:55,522
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

170
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:57,463
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

171
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,592
- You're in a jam and you know it.
- Says you.

172
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:01,898
- All I want is my money.
- Says you.

173
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:04,599
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

174
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,834
- This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood.
- Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

175
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,845
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

176
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:15,179
- I ain't so good. My truck burned down.
- Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

177
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:18,419
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

178
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:20,785
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

179
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:23,848
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

180
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,961
- What little man?
- The little man in here.

181
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:31,257
Every time one of these phonies
comes along, it ties knots in my stomach.

182
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,766
I can't eat.

183
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:36,066
Yours is one of them, Garlopis.
That's how I knew your claim was crooked.

184
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:37,662
So what did I do?

185
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,334
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

186
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,274
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

187
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:43,868
And what did they find?

188
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:47,245
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

189
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:48,876
What shavings?

190
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:52,512
The ones you soaked with kerosene
and dropped a match on.

191
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:58,283
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor guy.
Maybe I made a mistake.

192
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,654
That's one way of putting it.

193
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:02,959
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

194
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,262
Here. Just a minute.
Sign this and you'll feel fine.

195
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:08,201
- Sign what? - It's a waiver
on your claim. Right here.

196
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:10,803
- Here?
- Here.

197
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,573
Now you're an honest man again.
Goodbye, Garlopis.

198
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,580
But I ain't got no more truck.

199
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:22,048
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

200
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:24,608
What's the matter, Garlopis,
don't you know how to open the door?

201
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:27,986
Just put your hand
on the knob, turn it to the left.

202
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:30,825
Now pull it toward you.

203
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,587
- That's the boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

204
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:41,229
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

205
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:44,033
Are we an insurance company,
or just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

206
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,334
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

207
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:47,034
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

208
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:48,667
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

209
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:49,733
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

210
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,541
- before we accepted the risk.
- I know you did, Walter.

211
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:54,276
I'm not beefing at you. It's the company.
It's the way they do things.

212
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,442
The way they don't do things!

213
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:58,247
The way they'll write anything
just to get it down on the sales sheet.

214
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,811
And I'm the guy that has to
sit here up to my neck in phony claims...

215
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:03,824
so they won't throw more money out
the window than they take in at the door.

216
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:05,723
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

217
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:09,127
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick up
after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

218
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:10,893
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

219
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,831
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

220
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:15,495
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

221
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:17,539
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

222
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:21,440
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

223
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,842
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

224
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:26,642
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

225
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:29,309
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

226
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:30,784
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

227
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:33,651
and find out if their calendar checked
with the <i>World Almanac's</i> calendar.

228
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:34,916
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

229
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,221
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

230
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,256
I love you, too.

231
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:52,230
<i>I really did, too,</i>
<i>you old crab...</i>

232
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:55,606
<i>always yelling your head off,</i>
<i>always sore at everybody.</i>

233
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:59,474
<i>But you never fooled me with your</i>
<i>song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

234
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:02,016
<i>I kind of always knew that behind</i>
<i>the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

235
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:04,484
<i>you had a heart</i>
<i>as big as a house.</i>

236
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:07,716
<i>Back in my office there was</i>
<i>a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

237
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,519
<i>about the renewals.</i>

238
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:12,793
<i>She didn't want me to come</i>
<i>tomorrow evening.</i>

239
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:16,556
<i>She wanted me to come</i>
<i>Thursday afternoon at 3.30 instead.</i>

240
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:20,365
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up</i>
<i>for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

241
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:22,403
<i>including a trip</i>
<i>down to Santa Monica...</i>

242
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:26,237
<i>to see a couple of live prospects</i>
<i>about some group insurance.</i>

243
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:29,402
<i>But I kept thinking</i>
<i>about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

244
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:32,013
<i>and the way that</i>
<i>anklet of hers cut into her leg.</i>

245
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:42,117
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

246
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:44,754
I'm considering it.

247
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,959
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

248
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:52,000
- Last night wasn't so convenient.
- That's all right.

249
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,160
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

250
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:56,397
I was just fixing some iced tea.
Would you like a glass?

251
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:58,736
Yeah, unless you've got
a bottle of beer that's not working.

252
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:01,401
There may be some.
I never know what's in the icebox.

253
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,670
Nettie.

254
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:10,276
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

255
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:13,082
- Oh, you did? - Yes. He'll renew
with you, he told me so.

256
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,715
As a matter of fact,
I thought he'd be here this afternoon.

257
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,951
- But he's not?
- No.

258
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:19,719
That's terrible.

259
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:22,353
Nettie!

260
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:25,726
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

261
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:29,703
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

262
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:32,070
- Lemon? Sugar?
- Fix it your way.

263
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:37,337
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

264
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:40,575
- Like running the vacuum cleaner.
- Fresh.

265
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,449
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

266
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,453
Not much money,
but you learn a lot about life.

267
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:49,218
I didn't think you'd learned it
from a correspondence course.

268
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,989
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

269
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:55,256
- You're not English, are you?
- No. Californian.

270
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,389
Born right here
in Los Angeles.

271
00:17:57,466 --> 00:18:00,560
They say all native Californians
come from Iowa.

272
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,161
- Mr. Neff, I...
- Make it Walter, huh?

273
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,104
- Walter.
- That's right.

274
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:10,877
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

275
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,546
Twenty percent. Why?

276
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:15,242
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

277
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:17,911
- I can always use it.
- I was thinking about my husband.

278
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:20,386
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

279
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,753
- It's very dangerous.
- Not for an executive, is it?

280
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:24,224
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

281
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,591
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

282
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:27,890
It's got me worried sick.

283
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:30,295
You mean, some dark night
a crown block might fall on him?

284
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:32,833
- Please don't talk like that.
- But that's the idea.

285
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,893
The other day a casing line snapped
and caught the foreman.

286
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:38,769
- He's in the hospital
with a broken back. - That's bad.

287
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:41,332
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

288
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,640
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

289
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:45,407
- It could.
- Well...

290
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:50,081
don't you think he ought
to have accident insurance?

291
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,451
What kind of insurance
could he have?

292
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:55,752
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

293
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:57,883
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

294
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,360
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

295
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,694
- Capital sum? What's that?
- In case he gets killed.

296
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:06,899
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

297
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:09,335
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

298
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:10,803
Well, your husband
would understand.

299
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,671
I'm sure I could sell him on the idea
of some accident protection.

300
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:15,300
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

301
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,538
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

302
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:19,706
They're all tough at first.

303
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:21,743
He has a lot on his mind.

304
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:23,546
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

305
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:26,452
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

306
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:30,724
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

307
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:34,455
- Sounds pretty dull.
- So, I just sit and knit.

308
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:37,162
Is that what you
married him for?

309
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:40,395
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

310
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:43,133
Anytime his thumbs
get tired...

311
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,571
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

312
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,734
- Wouldn't I?
- You bet your life, you wouldn't.

313
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:54,248
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

314
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,843
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

315
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:04,684
Could I get an accident policy for him
without bothering him at all?

316
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,784
How's that, again?

317
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:08,830
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

318
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:10,421
I have a little
allowance of my own.

319
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:13,696
I could pay for it and he needn't
know anything about it.

320
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:17,332
Why shouldn't he know?

321
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,806
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

322
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,811
- He's superstitious about it. - A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

323
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:28,043
If there was a way to get it like that,
all the worry would be over.

324
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:32,078
- See what I mean, Walter?
- Sure. I got good eyesight.

325
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:34,884
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

326
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:37,983
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

327
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,858
- That's the setup, isn't it?
- Is there anything wrong with it?

328
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,260
No, I think it's lovely.

329
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,765
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

330
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,891
What crown block?

331
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:49,062
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

332
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:50,468
I don't know what
you're talking about.

333
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:51,972
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

334
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,134
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

335
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,303
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

336
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:59,609
- Are you crazy?
- Not that crazy.

337
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:03,412
- Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
- What's the matter?

338
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:08,382
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

339
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:11,850
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

340
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,394
That's a horrible
thing to say.

341
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:14,759
What'd you think
I was, anyway?

342
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,196
A guy that walks into a good looking
dame's front parlor and says:

343
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:19,233
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

344
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:20,563
"You got one that's been
around too long?

345
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:22,296
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

346
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:24,271
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect."

347
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:28,002
- Boy, what a dope you must think I am.
- I think you're rotten.

348
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:30,271
I think you're swell,
so long as I'm not your husband.

349
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:33,280
- Get out of here.
- You bet I'll get out of here, baby.

350
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:35,543
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

351
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:47,961
<i>So I let her have it</i>
<i>straight between the eyes.</i>

352
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,555
<i>She didn't fool me</i>
<i>for a minute, not this time.</i>

353
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,266
<i>I knew I had hold</i>
<i>of a red-hot poker...</i>

354
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:55,064
<i>and the time to drop it</i>
<i>was before it burned my hand off.</i>

355
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:59,706
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer,</i>
<i>the one I had wanted all along...</i>

356
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:03,643
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get</i>
<i>rid of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

357
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:05,612
<i>and everything</i>
<i>that went with it.</i>

358
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:08,877
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office</i>
<i>so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

359
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,475
<i>at Third and Western</i>
<i>and rolled a few lines...</i>

360
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:14,647
<i>to get my mind thinking about</i>
<i>something else for a while.</i>

361
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,722
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when</i>
<i>I left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

362
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:23,196
<i>So, I drove home, put the car away</i>
<i>and went up to my apartment.</i>

363
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:27,433
<i>It had begun to rain outside</i>
<i>and I watched it get dark...</i>

364
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:29,561
<i>and didn't even</i>
<i>turn on the light.</i>

365
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:31,438
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

366
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:33,338
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

367
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:36,241
<i>and I was still holding on</i>
<i>to that red-hot poker.</i>

368
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:40,377
<i>And right then it came over me that</i>
<i>I hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

369
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:42,914
<i>That the hook</i>
<i>was too strong...</i>

370
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:45,544
<i>that this wasn't the end</i>
<i>between her and me.</i>

371
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,279
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

372
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:52,791
<i>So at 8.00 the bell would ring and I'd know</i>
<i>who it was without even having to think.</i>

373
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:55,790
<i>As if it was the most</i>
<i>natural thing in the world.</i>

374
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:02,503
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

375
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:05,933
- Did I?
- Don't you want me to bring it in?

376
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:07,767
Sure.

377
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:11,273
Put it on the chair.

378
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:22,456
- How'd you know where I live?
- It's in the phone book.

379
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:25,054
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

380
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:27,993
Peel off your coat
and sit down.

381
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:32,157
Your husband out?

382
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,225
Yes. Long Beach.
They're spudding in a new well.

383
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:36,463
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

384
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:39,834
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

385
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:41,341
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

386
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:44,401
- Like what?
- Like it was this afternoon.

387
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:47,778
I must have said something that gave you
a terribly wrong impression.

388
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:50,750
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

389
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,081
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

390
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:54,987
- Not if you don't believe me.
- What do you want me to do?

391
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:57,686
I want you to be nice to me.

392
00:23:58,493 --> 00:24:00,984
Like the first time
you came to the house.

393
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:03,292
It can't be
like the first time.

394
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:06,163
- Something's happened.
- I know it has.

395
00:24:06,968 --> 00:24:08,731
It's happened to us.

396
00:24:11,273 --> 00:24:15,266
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

397
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:19,580
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

398
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:22,173
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

399
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:24,576
Maybe I oughtn't
to have come.

400
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:27,349
- Maybe you oughtn't.
- You want me to go?

401
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,720
- If you want to.
- Right now?

402
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,088
Sure, right now.

403
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:50,606
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you, Walter.

404
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:53,405
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

405
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:56,442
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

406
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:59,713
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

407
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:02,689
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.

408
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:05,723
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

409
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,632
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

410
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:24,211
- Club soda?
- Plain water, please.

411
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,077
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

412
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,482
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

413
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:33,921
Only he had
accident insurance.

414
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,514
So they had an autopsy
and she didn't get away with it.

415
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:38,684
- Who didn't?
- His wife.

416
00:25:40,795 --> 00:25:43,263
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

417
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:46,562
His wife said he was cleaning a gun
and his stomach got in the way.

418
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:50,261
All she collected was
a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

419
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:53,131
Perhaps it was
worth it to her.

420
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:57,971
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

421
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,944
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

422
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,614
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

423
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:10,749
- Cook your own breakfast?
- Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.

424
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,760
- Get the rest down at the
corner drugstore. - Sounds wonderful.

425
00:26:13,828 --> 00:26:15,557
Just strangers beside you.

426
00:26:15,997 --> 00:26:18,329
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

427
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,024
You don't have to
sit across the table...

428
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:23,298
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

429
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:26,636
What daughter? You mean
the little girl on the piano?

430
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:28,737
Lola. She lives with us.

431
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,335
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

432
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:34,146
- You ever think of a divorce?
- He wouldn't give me a divorce.

433
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:35,648
I suppose because
it'd cost him too much money.

434
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:38,277
He hasn't got any money.
Not since he went into the oil business.

435
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:40,116
But he had
when you married him?

436
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:44,718
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

437
00:26:45,894 --> 00:26:49,193
But that's not the only reason.
I was his wife's nurse.

438
00:26:49,264 --> 00:26:52,859
She was sick a long time.
When she died, he was terribly broken up.

439
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:56,395
- I pitied him so.
- And now you hate him.

440
00:26:56,604 --> 00:26:59,368
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

441
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:02,403
Every time I buy a dress or
a pair of shoes he yells his head off.

442
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:04,206
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

443
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,974
He's always been mean to me.

444
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:09,944
Even his life insurance
all goes to that daughter of his.

445
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:13,152
- That Lola.
- Nothing for you at all?

446
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:15,654
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

447
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:20,126
So you lie awake in the dark
and listen to him snore and get ideas.

448
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:23,196
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

449
00:27:23,998 --> 00:27:26,592
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

450
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:32,497
- Only sometimes you wish he was dead.
- Perhaps I do.

451
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:36,305
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

452
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:38,905
- Is that it?
- Perhaps that, too.

453
00:27:41,082 --> 00:27:44,176
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

454
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,080
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

455
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:49,885
and the motor still running.

456
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:53,953
And I thought what it would be like
if I didn't switch it off...

457
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:57,390
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

458
00:27:57,465 --> 00:27:58,625
I'll tell you what
it'd be like.

459
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,294
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

460
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:03,462
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

461
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:06,530
For him a setup like that'd be
just like a slice of rare roast beef.

462
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:08,438
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

463
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,603
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

464
00:28:10,678 --> 00:28:12,839
In a half-hour you'd be
signing your name to a confession.

465
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:14,745
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

466
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:17,080
Not if there's an insurance company
in the picture, baby.

467
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:19,245
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

468
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,811
And if there's a death mixed up in it,
you haven't got a prayer.

469
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,950
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

470
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:27,318
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

471
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:32,299
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

472
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:37,532
<i>So we just sat there.</i>

473
00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:41,967
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain</i>
<i>on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

474
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:45,041
<i>Maybe she had stopped</i>
<i>thinking about it, but I hadn't.</i>

475
00:28:45,313 --> 00:28:46,337
I couldn't.

476
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:49,850
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

477
00:28:49,918 --> 00:28:52,648
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

478
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:55,589
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

479
00:28:56,124 --> 00:28:57,284
In this business
you can't sleep...

480
00:28:57,358 --> 00:29:00,191
for trying to figure out
all the tricks they could pull on you.

481
00:29:00,261 --> 00:29:01,728
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

482
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:05,095
watching the customers to make sure
they don't crook the house.

483
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,831
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

484
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:10,427
And do it smart.

485
00:29:10,505 --> 00:29:12,598
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

486
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:14,801
You know every notch in it
by heart.

487
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:17,568
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

488
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:19,709
A shill to put down the bet.

489
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:21,874
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

490
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,384
and the whole setup
is right there in the room with you.

491
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:31,317
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

492
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:35,751
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

493
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:41,062
The stakes were $50,000,
but they were the life of a man, too.

494
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:44,437
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

495
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:47,733
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

496
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,504
<i>And I did.</i>

497
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:05,659
Will you phone me?
Walter?

498
00:30:08,563 --> 00:30:11,361
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

499
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:14,366
- You believe me, don't you, Walter?
- Sure I believe you.

500
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:20,333
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

501
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:22,740
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

502
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,368
It's better than
going on this way.

503
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:25,605
They're not gonna
hang you because...

504
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,477
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

505
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:30,245
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Sure, I know what I'm saying.

506
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:31,808
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

507
00:30:31,886 --> 00:30:35,014
- And I'm the guy that knows how.
- Walter, you're hurting me.

508
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:38,081
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

509
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,592
It's got to be perfect.

510
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,965
Call me tomorrow.
But not from your house. From a booth.

511
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,908
And watch your step
every single minute.

512
00:30:56,978 --> 00:31:00,106
This has got to be perfect, you understand?
Straight down the line.

513
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:03,340
Straight down the line.

514
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:47,588
<i>That was it, Keyes.</i>

515
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,688
<i>The machinery had started to move</i>
<i>and nothing could stop it.</i>

516
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:54,857
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

517
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:59,069
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

518
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:02,633
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

519
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:07,712
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

520
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:10,212
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

521
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:12,411
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

522
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:16,981
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

523
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:19,523
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

524
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:24,355
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

525
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,926
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

526
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:30,496
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

527
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:33,631
to have her sitting right there
in the room, playing Chinese checkers...

528
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,301
<i>as if nothing</i>
<i>were going to happen.</i>

529
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,873
I suppose you realize,
Mr. Dietrichson...

530
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:41,244
that, not being an employee...

531
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:43,613
you are not covered by
the State Compensation Insurance Act.

532
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:46,984
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

533
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,215
Yeah, I know
all about that.

534
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:49,756
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

535
00:32:49,824 --> 00:32:53,351
earthquake insurance and
lightning insurance and hail insurance.

536
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:55,157
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

537
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:57,026
we'd stay broke paying for it,
wouldn't we, honey?

538
00:32:57,098 --> 00:33:00,966
What keeps us broke is you going out
and buying five hats at a crack.

539
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:02,730
Who needs a hat in California?

540
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:04,499
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

541
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:07,006
accident insurance is
the cheapest coverage you can buy.

542
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:09,942
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

543
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:11,103
Just as you say.

544
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,977
Suppose we just settle
that automobile insurance tonight.

545
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:15,276
Sure.

546
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:18,917
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

547
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:20,884
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

548
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:23,321
- It bores me stiff.
- Got something better to do?

549
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:24,653
Yes, I have.

550
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:27,758
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

551
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:30,957
- Run along where? Who with?
- Just Anne. We're going roller-skating.

552
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:32,795
- Anne who?
- Anne Matthews.

553
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:34,835
It's not that
Nino Zachetti again, is it?

554
00:33:34,902 --> 00:33:36,301
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

555
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,598
If I ever catch you
with that...

556
00:33:37,672 --> 00:33:39,037
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

557
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:41,200
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

558
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:44,369
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

559
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:46,913
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

560
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:49,541
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

561
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:51,981
- Good night, Phyllis.
- Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

562
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:54,044
- I'm sorry. Good night, Mr...
- Neff.

563
00:33:54,122 --> 00:33:55,783
Good night, Mr. Neff.

564
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:00,794
A great little fighter
for her weight.

565
00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:04,289
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

566
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:06,765
- Sign what? - The applications
for the auto renewals.

567
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,802
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

568
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,565
- When will that be?
- About a week.

569
00:34:10,638 --> 00:34:12,572
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

570
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,471
- San Francisco?
- Palo Alto.

571
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,271
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

572
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:18,778
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

573
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:22,407
What's wrong with that? Can't I have
a little fun, even once a year?

574
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:24,144
Great football school,
Stanford.

575
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:26,209
- Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?
- Left guard.

576
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:27,914
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

577
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,320
The bottom line.

578
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:35,986
- Both copies, please.
- Sign twice, huh?

579
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:37,360
Yes. One is
the agent's copy.

580
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:41,390
- I need it for my files.
- Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

581
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,608
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

582
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:51,509
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

583
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:53,809
- How much you taking me for?
- $147.50.

584
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:56,577
I think that's enough
insurance for one evening, Mr. Neff.

585
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:57,845
Plenty.

586
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:04,418
Bring me some soda when you
come up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.

587
00:35:04,492 --> 00:35:05,516
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

588
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:08,187
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

589
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:25,508
Good night, Mr. Neff.

590
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:29,376
- All right, Walter?
- Fine.

591
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,350
- He signed it, didn't he?
- Sure he signed it. You saw him.

592
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:33,353
Now, listen. That trip to Palo Alto.
When does he leave?

593
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:34,410
End of the month.

594
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:35,477
- He drives, huh?
- He always drives.

595
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:37,183
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

596
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:38,816
- Why? - Because it's
all worked out for a train.

597
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,259
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

598
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:43,194
a little thing called
double indemnity.

599
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,165
The insurance companies put it in
as a sort of come-on for the customers.

600
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:48,395
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

601
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:50,096
The kind that almost
never happen.

602
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:52,662
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

603
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,174
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

604
00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:57,677
- I see.
- We're hitting it for the limit, baby.

605
00:35:57,745 --> 00:36:00,270
That's why
it's got to be the train.

606
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:04,415
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

607
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:06,385
Straight down the line.

608
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:27,365
Hello, Mr. Neff.

609
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:30,004
It's me.

610
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:33,111
- Is anything wrong?
- I've been waiting for you.

611
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,272
For me? Why?

612
00:36:34,348 --> 00:36:37,647
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

613
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,248
- Which way would that be?
- Down the hill. Down Vermont.

614
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:49,319
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

615
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:50,728
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

616
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,137
Going roller-skating, huh?

617
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:00,638
- You like roller-skating?
- I can take it or leave it.

618
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,710
- Only tonight you're leaving it?
- Yes, I am.

619
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:08,741
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

620
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:12,183
My father doesn't understand me
and Phyllis hates me.

621
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,147
- Sounds tough, all right.
- That's why I have to lie sometimes.

622
00:37:16,223 --> 00:37:17,622
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

623
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:19,626
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

624
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:22,822
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

625
00:37:23,998 --> 00:37:25,966
You won't tell on me,
will you?

626
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:28,763
- I'd have to think it over.
- Nino's not what my father says at all.

627
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:31,930
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

628
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:34,975
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

629
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:37,704
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

630
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:41,804
Then he lost his job for talking back.
He's so hot-headed.

631
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:44,314
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

632
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:46,876
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

633
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:49,184
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

634
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:53,022
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

635
00:37:54,428 --> 00:37:56,623
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

636
00:37:56,697 --> 00:38:00,861
I suppose it will sometime.
This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

637
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:06,068
Nino? Over here, Nino.

638
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:17,309
- This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
- Hello, Nino.

639
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:19,018
The name is Zachetti.

640
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:21,748
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave me
a ride from the house.

641
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:22,914
I told him all about us.

642
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,355
Why does he have to
get told about us?

643
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,416
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

644
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:28,052
I'm not doing any worrying.

645
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:29,426
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

646
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:31,226
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

647
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:33,789
- Why, he's a friend.
- I don't have any friends.

648
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:36,132
If I did, I like to pick them myself.
Come on.

649
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:38,535
Look, sonny, she needed a ride,
so I brought her along.

650
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:40,767
Is that anything
to get tough about?

651
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:43,309
All right, Lola, make up your mind.
Are you coming or aren't you?

652
00:38:43,377 --> 00:38:45,174
Of course I'm coming.

653
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:51,014
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

654
00:38:51,085 --> 00:38:53,417
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

655
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:00,523
<i>She was a nice kid.</i>

656
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:03,764
<i>Maybe he was a little better</i>
<i>than he sounded.</i>

657
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:07,267
<i>But right then it gave me a nasty feeling</i>
<i>to be thinking about them at all...</i>

658
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:11,031
<i>with that briefcase right behind my head</i>
<i>that had her father's signature in it...</i>

659
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:13,232
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

660
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:15,537
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

661
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:19,678
<i>It was only a question of time,</i>
<i>and not very much time at that.</i>

662
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:22,477
<i>You know that big market</i>
<i>up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

663
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,777
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I</i>
<i>had picked for a meeting place.</i>

664
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:28,947
<i>I already had most of</i>
<i>the plan in my head...</i>

665
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:31,321
<i>but a lot of details</i>
<i>had to be worked out.</i>

666
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:34,953
<i>And she had to know them</i>
<i>all by heart when the time came.</i>

667
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:37,990
<i>We had to be very careful</i>
<i>from now on.</i>

668
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:40,760
<i>We couldn't let anybody</i>
<i>see us together.</i>

669
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:43,736
<i>We couldn't even talk to each other</i>
<i>on the telephone.</i>

670
00:39:43,804 --> 00:39:46,671
<i>Not from her house</i>
<i>or at my office, anyway.</i>

671
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:51,674
<i>So she was to be in the market</i>
<i>every morning about 11.00, buying stuff.</i>

672
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:55,348
<i>And I could sort of run into her there</i>
<i>any day I wanted to.</i>

673
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,748
<i>Sort of accidentally</i>
<i>on purpose.</i>

674
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,110
- Walter, I wanted to...
- Not so loud.

675
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:04,251
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

676
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:06,452
Let me talk first.
It's all set.

677
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:09,018
The accident policy came through.
I've got it in my pocket.

678
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:12,031
I got his check, too.
I saw him down in the oil fields.

679
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:14,226
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

680
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:17,168
The check's just made out to the company,
so it could be for anything.

681
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:20,036
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

682
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:23,167
It'll be all right that way,
because one of the cars is in your name.

683
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:25,007
Open your bag. Quick.

684
00:40:30,184 --> 00:40:31,583
Can you get in
the safe-deposit box?

685
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:33,643
- Yes. We both have keys.
- Fine.

686
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:36,019
But don't put the policy
in there yet. I'll tell you when.

687
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,820
Remember, you never saw it, you never
even touched it, you understand?

688
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:41,487
- I'm not a fool. - Okay.
When is he leaving on the train?

689
00:40:41,562 --> 00:40:43,029
- That's just it. He isn't going.
- What?

690
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:44,997
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

691
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:46,657
What happened?

692
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:51,238
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

693
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:52,966
That one up there?

694
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:58,743
I don't know why they always put
what I want on the top shelf.

695
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:01,708
Go ahead. I'm listening.

696
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:04,148
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

697
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:06,948
- Broke his leg?
- What do we do now, Walter?

698
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:09,648
- Nothing. We just wait.
- Wait for what?

699
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:11,190
Until he can
take the train.

700
00:41:11,258 --> 00:41:12,486
I told you it's got
to be the train.

701
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,891
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

702
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,953
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

703
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:19,795
- There are other ways.
- We're not gonna do it other ways.

704
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:20,959
But we can't leave it
like this.

705
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:23,970
What do you suppose would happen if
he found out about the accident policy?

706
00:41:24,038 --> 00:41:26,097
Plenty. But not as bad as sitting
in that death house.

707
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:28,971
Don't ever talk like that. - Don't let's
start losing our heads, that's all.

708
00:41:29,043 --> 00:41:31,238
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.

709
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:36,480
Excuse me.

710
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:41,179
We're gonna do it right.
That's all I said.

711
00:41:41,255 --> 00:41:42,745
It's the waiting
that's getting me.

712
00:41:42,823 --> 00:41:44,290
It's getting me
just as bad, baby.

713
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:47,384
- But we've got to wait.
- Maybe we have, Walter, only...

714
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:50,919
it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

715
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:56,032
I better go, baby.
I'm thinking of you every minute.

716
00:42:02,076 --> 00:42:05,637
<i>After that, a full week went</i>
<i>by and I didn't see her once.</i>

717
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:09,204
<i>I tried to keep my mind off her</i>
<i>and off the whole idea.</i>

718
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:12,183
<i>I kept telling myself that maybe</i>
<i>those Fates they say watch over you...</i>

719
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:15,984
<i>had gotten together and broken his leg</i>
<i>to give me a way out.</i>

720
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,049
<i>Then it was the 15th of June.</i>
<i>You may remember that date, Keyes.</i>

721
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:24,795
<i>You came into my office</i>
<i>around 3.00 in the afternoon.</i>

722
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:26,763
Hello, Keyes.

723
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:28,062
I just came
from Norton's office.

724
00:42:28,135 --> 00:42:29,625
The semiannual sales
records are out.

725
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:32,604
You're high man, Walter.
That's twice in a row. Congratulations.

726
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:35,369
Thanks. How would you
like a cheap drink?

727
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:37,933
How would you like
a $50 cut in salary?

728
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:40,276
- Do I laugh now or wait till
it gets funny? - No, I'm serious.

729
00:42:40,347 --> 00:42:43,646
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

730
00:42:43,717 --> 00:42:45,048
Too much pressure
on my nerves.

731
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,144
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

732
00:42:47,221 --> 00:42:49,121
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

733
00:42:49,189 --> 00:42:50,588
Me? Why pick on me?

734
00:42:50,658 --> 00:42:53,183
Well, because I've got a crazy idea
you might be good at the job.

735
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,659
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

736
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:57,925
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

737
00:42:58,499 --> 00:42:59,761
You're too good
to be a salesman.

738
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,960
- Nobody's too good to be a salesman.
- Phooey!

739
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:05,528
All you guys do is just ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

740
00:43:05,606 --> 00:43:07,767
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

741
00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:09,365
- Well, that'd trouble anybody.
- Now look, Walter.

742
00:43:09,443 --> 00:43:12,412
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

743
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:14,379
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

744
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:15,574
It's the hottest job
in the business.

745
00:43:15,649 --> 00:43:16,877
Yeah, but it's still
a desk job.

746
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,077
- I don't want to be nailed to a desk.
- Desk job?

747
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:20,745
Is that all you can see in it?

748
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:23,790
Just a hard chair to park your pants on
from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

749
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:26,587
Just a pile of papers to shuffle around,
and five sharp pencils...

750
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,029
and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

751
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:33,123
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

752
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,296
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

753
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:40,204
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

754
00:43:40,274 --> 00:43:44,074
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

755
00:43:44,144 --> 00:43:47,272
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

756
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,676
with twisted hopes
and crooked dreams.

757
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,981
A claims man, Walter,
is a doctor and a bloodhound and a...

758
00:43:55,456 --> 00:43:57,583
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

759
00:43:57,858 --> 00:44:00,986
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury...

760
00:44:01,061 --> 00:44:02,756
and a father confessor,
all in one.

761
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,388
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

762
00:44:04,465 --> 00:44:05,625
You don't want to work
with your brains?

763
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:07,758
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

764
00:44:07,835 --> 00:44:11,362
for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

765
00:44:11,438 --> 00:44:13,963
- Walter Neff speaking.
- I had to call you, Walter.

766
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,406
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?

767
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,038
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

768
00:44:20,748 --> 00:44:23,945
No, you can't.
I've only got a minute. It can't wait.

769
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:27,316
Listen. He's going tonight. On the train.
Are you listening?

770
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:29,982
- Walter?
- Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

771
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:33,216
- Only, make it snappy, will you?
- He's on crutches.

772
00:44:33,293 --> 00:44:36,626
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

773
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:39,461
It's wonderful, Walter.
Just the way you wanted it, on a train.

774
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:42,093
Only with the crutches
it makes it much better, doesn't it?

775
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:44,603
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

776
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:47,503
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

777
00:44:47,574 --> 00:44:50,304
- Keyes, suppose I join you in your office?
- That's all right. I'll wait.

778
00:44:50,377 --> 00:44:52,811
Only tell her
not to take all day.

779
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:55,707
Go ahead.

780
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:59,109
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

781
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:01,017
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

782
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:04,353
And the signal is three honks
on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

783
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,149
No.

784
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:07,416
Oh, uh...

785
00:45:07,995 --> 00:45:09,587
what color did you pick?

786
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:12,564
Blue. Navy blue.
And the cast is on his left leg.

787
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,494
Mmm-hmm.

788
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:16,559
Yeah, that suits me fine.

789
00:45:16,637 --> 00:45:18,901
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

790
00:45:18,972 --> 00:45:21,998
But it's straight down the line
for both of us.

791
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:24,202
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

792
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,180
- Sorry, Keyes.
- What's the matter?

793
00:45:28,248 --> 00:45:30,978
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

794
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:32,916
If I told you
it was a customer...

795
00:45:33,086 --> 00:45:35,145
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

796
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:37,087
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

797
00:45:37,157 --> 00:45:41,218
- Why don't you, for instance?
- I almost did, once. Long time ago.

798
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:43,058
Now look, Keyes,
I've got to call on a prospect.

799
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,655
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

800
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:47,962
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

801
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:50,868
I was on my way to the jewelry store
to buy the ring.

802
00:45:50,938 --> 00:45:53,532
And then suddenly that little man
in here started working on me.

803
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:55,131
So you went back
and had her investigated?

804
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:57,643
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

805
00:45:58,612 --> 00:46:00,978
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

806
00:46:01,048 --> 00:46:03,573
There was a manic depressive
in her family, on her mother's side.

807
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,277
She already had one husband.

808
00:46:05,352 --> 00:46:07,445
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

809
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:09,580
- And as for her brother...
- I get the general idea.

810
00:46:09,656 --> 00:46:13,285
- She was a tramp from a long line
of tramps. - Yeah. All right, all right.

811
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,090
Now what do I say to Norton?
What about this job I want you for?

812
00:46:16,163 --> 00:46:17,721
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.

813
00:46:17,798 --> 00:46:20,289
- Thanks just the same.
- Fair enough.

814
00:46:21,235 --> 00:46:23,465
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

815
00:46:23,537 --> 00:46:25,698
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

816
00:46:25,772 --> 00:46:29,105
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

817
00:46:36,283 --> 00:46:39,275
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

818
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,647
You're just a little taller.

819
00:46:52,566 --> 00:46:53,931
<i>Yes, Keyes.</i>

820
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:57,596
<i>Those Fates I was talking about</i>
<i>had only been stalling me off.</i>

821
00:46:57,671 --> 00:47:01,038
<i>Now they had thrown the switch.</i>
<i>The gears had meshed.</i>

822
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,769
<i>The time for thinking</i>
<i>had all run out.</i>

823
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:08,242
<i>I wanted my movements accounted for</i>
<i>up to the last possible moment.</i>

824
00:47:08,315 --> 00:47:12,445
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate book</i>
<i>on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

825
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:14,544
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

826
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:18,719
<i>From here on, it was a question</i>
<i>of following the timetable...</i>

827
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:19,816
<i>move by move.</i>

828
00:47:21,662 --> 00:47:24,756
<i>I got home about 7.00 and</i>
<i>drove right into the garage.</i>

829
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:27,766
<i>This was another item</i>
<i>to establish my alibi.</i>

830
00:47:29,136 --> 00:47:31,434
- Hi, Mr. Neff.
- Hello, Charlie.

831
00:47:31,505 --> 00:47:33,336
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

832
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:34,567
How soon you gonna want it?

833
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:36,040
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

834
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:37,633
Any time you get
to it, Charlie.

835
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:39,941
- I'm staying in tonight.
- Okay.

836
00:47:40,047 --> 00:47:42,015
<i>Up in my apartment</i>
<i>I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

837
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:44,380
<i>one of the salesmen</i>
<i>that shared my office.</i>

838
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:47,852
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll call</i>
<i>and there'd be a record of it.</i>

839
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:50,219
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my rate book</i>
<i>and needed some dope...</i>

840
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,225
<i>on the public liability bond</i>
<i>I was figuring.</i>

841
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,126
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit like</i>
<i>Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

842
00:47:57,197 --> 00:48:00,291
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back</i>
<i>and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

843
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:02,801
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and</i>
<i>a roll of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

844
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:06,862
<i>so I could fake something that</i>
<i>looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

845
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,965
<i>Next, I stuck a card</i>
<i>inside the telephone box...</i>

846
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:11,875
<i>so that it would fall down</i>
<i>if the bell rang.</i>

847
00:48:11,945 --> 00:48:15,437
<i>That way I'd know if anybody had</i>
<i>called me while I was away.</i>

848
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:19,713
<i>Then I did the same thing to the doorbell</i>
<i>in case anybody came to see me.</i>

849
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,849
<i>I left the apartment</i>
<i>by the service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

850
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:28,123
<i>I walked all the way from my apartment</i>
<i>to the Dietrichson house.</i>

851
00:48:28,195 --> 00:48:29,560
<i>I didn't want</i>
<i>to take the bus...</i>

852
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,293
<i>because there was always the chance that</i>
<i>someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

853
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:35,358
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

854
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:38,363
<i>I could smell that</i>
<i>honeysuckle again.</i>

855
00:48:38,472 --> 00:48:41,635
<i>Only it was even stronger,</i>
<i>now that it was night.</i>

856
00:48:46,046 --> 00:48:49,243
<i>I slid the garage door open</i>
<i>as quietly as I could.</i>

857
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:52,643
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,</i>
<i>just the way I told her to.</i>

858
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:54,209
<i>I'd figured it was</i>
<i>safer that way...</i>

859
00:48:54,287 --> 00:48:57,347
<i>in case he got into the car</i>
<i>before she drove it out.</i>

860
00:48:57,424 --> 00:48:59,722
<i>I got into</i>
<i>the back of the car.</i>

861
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:02,261
<i>I lay there on the floor</i>
<i>and waited.</i>

862
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:05,423
<i>All the time I was thinking about that</i>
<i>dark street on the way to the station...</i>

863
00:49:05,499 --> 00:49:07,296
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

864
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:10,131
<i>and the three honks on the horn</i>
<i>that were to be the signal.</i>

865
00:49:10,203 --> 00:49:12,603
<i>About 10 minutes later</i>
<i>they came down.</i>

866
00:49:12,673 --> 00:49:14,402
- All right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

867
00:49:14,474 --> 00:49:16,908
I'll have the car out
in a second.

868
00:49:53,714 --> 00:49:57,013
- Take it easy, honey.
We've got lots of time. - Yeah.

869
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:18,462
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

870
00:50:18,538 --> 00:50:20,267
you might end up
with a shorter leg.

871
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,140
So what? I could break
the other one and match them up again.

872
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:27,002
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

873
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,777
It's only for four days.
I'll be back Monday at the latest.

874
00:50:46,867 --> 00:50:50,166
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

875
00:50:54,107 --> 00:50:56,234
What are you doing that for?

876
00:50:57,244 --> 00:50:59,712
What are you
honking the horn for?

877
00:51:59,873 --> 00:52:01,864
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

878
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:04,274
- Don't worry.
- Keep away from me as much as you can.

879
00:52:04,344 --> 00:52:06,812
- Tell them I don't want to be helped.
- I said, don't worry, Walter.

880
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,110
You start as soon as
the train leaves.

881
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:11,844
When you get to the refinery,
turn off the highway onto the dirt road.

882
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:13,476
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

883
00:52:13,553 --> 00:52:14,986
to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.

884
00:52:15,055 --> 00:52:17,580
- I remember everything.
- No speeding.

885
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:21,621
You don't want any cops stopping you
with him in the back.

886
00:52:21,695 --> 00:52:24,061
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

887
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,394
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

888
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:28,592
I'll be back on
the observation platform.

889
00:52:28,668 --> 00:52:31,330
I'll drop off as close to
the spot as I can.

890
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:34,464
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

891
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,945
- San Francisco train, lady?
- Car 9, section 11. Just my husband.

892
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:42,504
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.

893
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,524
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

894
00:52:52,592 --> 00:52:54,457
Car number 8. Up there.

895
00:52:59,766 --> 00:53:03,361
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

896
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:08,372
- Here're the tickets. - Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

897
00:53:08,441 --> 00:53:09,806
Yeah. You take it easy
driving home.

898
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:13,312
- I'll miss you, honey.
- Section 11, sir.

899
00:53:15,215 --> 00:53:17,080
- All aboard!
- Thank you.

900
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,310
- Goodbye, honey.
- All aboard!

901
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,752
Good luck, honey.

902
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:36,960
Porter, will you make up
my berth right away?

903
00:53:37,037 --> 00:53:38,095
Yes, sir.

904
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,866
I'm going back to
the observation car for a smoke.

905
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,635
Right this way, sir.

906
00:54:13,473 --> 00:54:14,940
Like a chair?

907
00:54:17,143 --> 00:54:20,078
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

908
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:24,882
- You going far?
- Palo Alto.

909
00:54:25,752 --> 00:54:26,810
My name's Jackson.

910
00:54:26,886 --> 00:54:30,083
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

911
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,481
I had a broken arm once.

912
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:36,292
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

913
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:38,694
I thought I'd go crazy
with mine.

914
00:54:38,765 --> 00:54:42,826
Palo Alto's a nice little town.
You a Stanford man?

915
00:54:43,636 --> 00:54:47,834
- I used to be. - I'll bet you
left something behind.

916
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:50,007
I always do.

917
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:53,543
My cigar case. I guess I left it
in my overcoat back in the section.

918
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:56,946
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister...

919
00:54:57,017 --> 00:54:58,006
Dietrichson.

920
00:54:58,518 --> 00:55:01,009
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.

921
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:04,918
- Maybe the porter could...
- Well, I could get your cigars for you.

922
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:08,358
- Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
- If it's not too much trouble.

923
00:55:08,428 --> 00:55:12,228
- Car 9, section 11.
- Car 9, section 11. With pleasure.

924
00:55:56,509 --> 00:55:58,067
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

925
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:01,636
Here, take his hat.
Pick up the crutches back on the tracks.

926
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,775
Okay, baby. That's it.

927
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:32,867
All right. Let's go.

928
00:57:42,749 --> 00:57:44,580
<i>On the way back,</i>
<i>we went over once more...</i>

929
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:46,084
<i>what she was to do</i>
<i>at the inquest...</i>

930
00:57:46,152 --> 00:57:49,883
<i>if they had one, and about the insurance,</i>
<i>when that came up.</i>

931
00:57:50,023 --> 00:57:53,083
<i>I was afraid she might go to pieces</i>
<i>a little, now that we had done it.</i>

932
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:57,755
<i>But she was perfect. No nerves.</i>
<i>Not a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.</i>

933
00:57:58,765 --> 00:58:01,825
<i>She dropped me a block</i>
<i>from my apartment house.</i>

934
00:58:02,635 --> 00:58:06,093
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

935
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,638
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

936
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:21,842
- I love you, Walter.
- I love you, baby.

937
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:38,767
<i>It was two minutes past 11.00,</i>
<i>as I went up the service stairs again.</i>

938
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:42,831
<i>Nobody saw me this time either.</i>
<i>In the apartment I checked the bells.</i>

939
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:45,901
<i>The cards hadn't moved.</i>
<i>No calls. No visitors.</i>

940
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:51,372
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.</i>
<i>That left one last thing to do.</i>

941
00:58:52,352 --> 00:58:56,345
<i>I had to go down to the garage.</i>
<i>I wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

942
00:59:03,029 --> 00:59:05,930
You gonna use your car, after all?
I'm not quite through.

943
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:07,864
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.

944
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:10,027
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

945
00:59:10,103 --> 00:59:13,072
Been working upstairs all night.
My stomach's getting a little sore at me.

946
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:14,731
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

947
00:59:16,676 --> 00:59:18,667
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

948
00:59:18,745 --> 00:59:21,407
<i>Nothing had slipped,</i>
<i>nothing had been overlooked.</i>

949
00:59:21,481 --> 00:59:23,881
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>to give us away.</i>

950
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:27,579
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down</i>
<i>the street to the drugstore...</i>

951
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:31,090
<i>suddenly it came over me that</i>
<i>everything would go wrong.</i>

952
00:59:31,157 --> 00:59:34,354
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,</i>
<i>but it's true, so help me.</i>

953
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,927
<i>I couldn't hear</i>
<i>my own footsteps.</i>

954
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:42,329
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

955
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:52,803
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

956
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:56,747
and the next day was worse,
when the story had broke in the papers...

957
00:59:56,816 --> 00:59:58,716
and they started talking
about it at the office...

958
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:02,016
and the day after that,
when you started digging into it.

959
01:00:02,088 --> 01:00:06,024
I kept my hands in my pockets because
I thought they were shaking.

960
01:00:06,092 --> 01:00:08,322
I put on dark glasses
so people couldn't see my eyes.

961
01:00:08,394 --> 01:00:12,353
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

962
01:00:12,432 --> 01:00:15,128
I tried to
hold myself together, but...

963
01:00:15,468 --> 01:00:18,460
<i>I could feel my nerves</i>
<i>pulling me to pieces.</i>

964
01:00:21,207 --> 01:00:24,040
- Oh, Walter?
- Hello, Keyes.

965
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,471
Come along. The big boss
wants to see us.

966
01:00:26,546 --> 01:00:28,844
- The Dietrichson case?
- Must be.

967
01:00:29,015 --> 01:00:30,983
- Anything wrong?
- Well, the guy is dead.

968
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,952
We had him insured and it's gonna
cost us dough. That's always wrong.

969
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:37,285
- What have they got so far?
- Autopsy report.

970
01:00:37,357 --> 01:00:40,986
No heart failure, no apoplexy,
no predisposing medical cause of any kind.

971
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,925
Died of a broken neck.

972
01:00:43,062 --> 01:00:45,087
- When's the inquest?
- Had it this morning.

973
01:00:45,164 --> 01:00:47,223
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

974
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,098
The train people and some of
the passengers told how he went through...

975
01:00:50,169 --> 01:00:51,431
to the observation car.

976
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:55,065
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

977
01:00:56,676 --> 01:00:58,143
What do the police figure?

978
01:00:58,211 --> 01:01:00,873
That he got tangled up
in his crutches and fell off the train.

979
01:01:00,947 --> 01:01:02,574
They're satisfied.

980
01:01:02,648 --> 01:01:05,276
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.

981
01:01:06,753 --> 01:01:08,618
All right. Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

982
01:01:08,755 --> 01:01:10,916
I believe the legal position
is now clear.

983
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,322
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

984
01:01:13,393 --> 01:01:16,260
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

985
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,898
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

986
01:01:22,969 --> 01:01:25,961
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton,
but I didn't know this was formal.

987
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:27,403
- Sit down, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

988
01:01:27,473 --> 01:01:28,497
Any new developments?

989
01:01:28,574 --> 01:01:31,202
I just talked to this Jackson
long distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

990
01:01:31,277 --> 01:01:32,301
Who's Jackson?

991
01:01:32,378 --> 01:01:33,902
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

992
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,540
They were out on the
observation platform together, talking.

993
01:01:36,616 --> 01:01:38,675
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

994
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:40,412
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

995
01:01:40,486 --> 01:01:42,852
When he returned to the
observation platform, no Dietrichson.

996
01:01:42,922 --> 01:01:44,787
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

997
01:01:44,857 --> 01:01:46,825
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

998
01:01:46,893 --> 01:01:49,623
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

999
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,186
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

1000
01:01:52,265 --> 01:01:54,256
Anything else?
No, not much.

1001
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:57,325
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1002
01:01:57,403 --> 01:02:00,770
There's a daughter, but all she remembers
is Neff talking to her father...

1003
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,070
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1004
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:04,507
I couldn't sell him at first.

1005
01:02:04,577 --> 01:02:07,512
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1006
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,777
Later I saw him
in the oil fields and closed him.

1007
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,875
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1008
01:02:12,952 --> 01:02:15,352
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1009
01:02:15,421 --> 01:02:17,048
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1010
01:02:17,123 --> 01:02:19,091
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

1011
01:02:19,158 --> 01:02:22,423
Are your salesmen supposed to know
a customer is going to fall off the train?

1012
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:26,295
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1013
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:28,964
- I don't get it.
- You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1014
01:02:29,035 --> 01:02:30,525
Then what do you
think of this case?

1015
01:02:30,603 --> 01:02:32,366
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1016
01:02:32,438 --> 01:02:34,565
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1017
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,403
Just what is your opinion?

1018
01:02:36,476 --> 01:02:38,205
- No opinion at all.
- Not even a hunch?

1019
01:02:38,277 --> 01:02:40,643
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1020
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,044
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1021
01:02:42,114 --> 01:02:45,811
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes.
I've formed a very definite opinion.

1022
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:49,548
I think I know. In fact, I know
I know what happened to Dietrichson.

1023
01:02:49,622 --> 01:02:52,989
- You know you know what?
- I know it was not an accident.

1024
01:02:56,362 --> 01:02:58,922
- What do you say to that?
- Me?

1025
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:02,699
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1026
01:03:02,768 --> 01:03:06,329
There's a widespread feeling that
just because a man has a large office...

1027
01:03:09,408 --> 01:03:12,104
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1028
01:03:12,645 --> 01:03:14,203
There's a widespread
feeling that...

1029
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,579
just because a man has a large office,
he must be an idiot.

1030
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,584
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1031
01:03:19,652 --> 01:03:22,621
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1032
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,315
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1033
01:03:28,494 --> 01:03:30,928
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1034
01:03:30,997 --> 01:03:33,761
I assure you I appreciate it.
This is Mr. Keyes.

1035
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,300
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1036
01:03:35,368 --> 01:03:37,393
- And Mr. Neff.
- I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1037
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:40,030
- Mrs. Dietrichson.
- Won't you sit down?

1038
01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:44,506
May I extend our sympathy
in your bereavement?

1039
01:03:44,577 --> 01:03:47,068
I hesitated before asking you
to come here so soon after your loss.

1040
01:03:47,146 --> 01:03:50,809
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1041
01:03:50,883 --> 01:03:52,441
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1042
01:03:52,518 --> 01:03:55,112
No. All I know is that your secretary
made it sound very urgent.

1043
01:03:55,187 --> 01:03:57,314
Your husband had
an accident policy with this company.

1044
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:59,085
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1045
01:03:59,158 --> 01:04:01,888
No. I remember some talk at the house,
but he didn't seem to want it.

1046
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:05,260
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1047
01:04:05,331 --> 01:04:07,822
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1048
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,663
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1049
01:04:09,735 --> 01:04:11,726
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

1050
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:13,499
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1051
01:04:13,573 --> 01:04:15,006
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

1052
01:04:15,074 --> 01:04:16,701
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1053
01:04:16,776 --> 01:04:17,800
What sort of things?

1054
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,371
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

1055
01:04:20,446 --> 01:04:23,506
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1056
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:26,177
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1057
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,748
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1058
01:04:31,991 --> 01:04:33,322
a suicide.

1059
01:04:36,729 --> 01:04:40,096
- I'm sorry. Would you like
a glass of water? - Please.

1060
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,201
Thank you.

1061
01:04:52,178 --> 01:04:55,739
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1062
01:04:55,815 --> 01:04:58,579
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1063
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:01,984
He was perfectly all right and
I don't know of any financial worries.

1064
01:05:02,054 --> 01:05:04,181
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

1065
01:05:04,256 --> 01:05:08,386
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1066
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:11,462
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1067
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,192
- Do what? - Next, he goes
on this trip entirely alone.

1068
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:17,861
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1069
01:05:17,937 --> 01:05:21,600
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1070
01:05:21,841 --> 01:05:24,935
Once there, he finds he is not alone.
There is a man there.

1071
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:28,742
- What was his name, Keyes?
- His name was Jackson. Probably still is.

1072
01:05:29,248 --> 01:05:32,945
So he gets rid of this Jackson
with some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1073
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:36,318
- And then he is alone.
And then he does it. - Does what?

1074
01:05:36,389 --> 01:05:40,086
He jumps. Suicide. In which case,
the company is not liable.

1075
01:05:40,459 --> 01:05:43,326
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1076
01:05:43,396 --> 01:05:47,196
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1077
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,699
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1078
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:53,671
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1079
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:56,207
A settlement for a certain sum,
a part of the policy value.

1080
01:05:56,275 --> 01:05:59,972
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1081
01:06:00,046 --> 01:06:02,071
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1082
01:06:02,148 --> 01:06:04,582
Now you tell me you want to
pay me a part of it, whatever it is.

1083
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:06,982
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1084
01:06:07,053 --> 01:06:10,420
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1085
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:14,220
In fact, I don't like you, Mr. Norton.
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1086
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:22,296
Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1087
01:06:22,368 --> 01:06:23,733
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

1088
01:06:23,803 --> 01:06:27,000
Then you heaved an illegal forward pass
and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1089
01:06:27,073 --> 01:06:30,008
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1090
01:06:30,076 --> 01:06:33,102
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1091
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:34,669
Oh, can we?

1092
01:06:34,747 --> 01:06:38,581
Mr. Norton, the first thing
that struck me was that suicide angle.

1093
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:42,382
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1094
01:06:42,455 --> 01:06:46,016
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1095
01:06:46,092 --> 01:06:48,560
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1096
01:06:48,627 --> 01:06:50,754
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1097
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,593
Yeah, in the front office.

1098
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:55,828
Come now, you've never read
an actuarial table in your life, have you?

1099
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:58,165
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1100
01:06:58,237 --> 01:07:00,034
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1101
01:07:00,106 --> 01:07:02,097
by sex, by seasons of the year,
by time of day.

1102
01:07:02,174 --> 01:07:05,541
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1103
01:07:05,611 --> 01:07:08,273
Suicide by poison,
subdivided by types of poison...

1104
01:07:08,347 --> 01:07:10,975
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1105
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:12,517
alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

1106
01:07:12,585 --> 01:07:15,281
Suicide by leaps, subdivided by
leaps from high places...

1107
01:07:15,354 --> 01:07:17,481
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1108
01:07:17,556 --> 01:07:20,821
under the feet of horses,
from steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1109
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,587
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1110
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:26,028
from the rear end
of a moving train.

1111
01:07:26,098 --> 01:07:27,861
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1112
01:07:27,933 --> 01:07:30,902
at the point where the body was found?
15 miles an hour.

1113
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,131
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1114
01:07:33,205 --> 01:07:36,072
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1115
01:07:36,142 --> 01:07:37,837
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1116
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:41,004
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1117
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,672
May I have this?

1118
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:47,610
Come on, Walter.

1119
01:07:50,756 --> 01:07:52,951
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1120
01:08:09,408 --> 01:08:11,842
<i>I could have hugged you</i>
<i>right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1121
01:08:11,911 --> 01:08:13,469
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1122
01:08:13,546 --> 01:08:16,276
<i>You were the only one</i>
<i>we were really scared of...</i>

1123
01:08:16,348 --> 01:08:19,078
<i>and instead you were</i>
<i>almost playing on our team.</i>

1124
01:08:19,565 --> 01:08:22,591
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1125
01:08:22,668 --> 01:08:24,693
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

1126
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:27,568
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1127
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,904
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1128
01:08:29,976 --> 01:08:32,638
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

1129
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:43,454
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1130
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,848
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

1131
01:08:45,925 --> 01:08:49,156
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1132
01:08:49,228 --> 01:08:51,753
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

1133
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:54,425
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

1134
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:56,760
- Can I come up?
- Okay. But be careful.

1135
01:08:56,836 --> 01:08:58,599
Don't let anybody see you.

1136
01:09:24,897 --> 01:09:26,364
Hello, Keyes.

1137
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:34,666
- What's on your mind?
- That broken leg.

1138
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:38,302
- The guy had a broken leg.
- What are you talking about?

1139
01:09:38,377 --> 01:09:41,904
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1140
01:09:42,181 --> 01:09:44,240
- Yeah.
- Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1141
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:46,251
- So what?
- And he didn't put in a claim.

1142
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,085
- Why didn't he put in a claim? Why?
- What are you driving at?

1143
01:09:50,256 --> 01:09:55,057
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1144
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:56,822
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1145
01:09:56,896 --> 01:09:59,228
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1146
01:09:59,298 --> 01:10:03,132
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1147
01:10:03,202 --> 01:10:06,194
Maybe he just didn't know
that he was insured.

1148
01:10:08,374 --> 01:10:09,864
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1149
01:10:09,942 --> 01:10:12,137
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1150
01:10:12,211 --> 01:10:13,235
- Yeah.
- You got his check?

1151
01:10:13,312 --> 01:10:14,472
Sure I did.

1152
01:10:15,281 --> 01:10:18,216
- Got any bicarbonate of soda?
- No, I haven't.

1153
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:22,614
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1154
01:10:23,155 --> 01:10:25,783
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1155
01:10:25,858 --> 01:10:28,292
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1156
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:29,953
No. Not suicide.

1157
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:33,623
- But not an accident, either.
- What else?

1158
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:35,394
Now look, Walter.

1159
01:10:35,468 --> 01:10:38,437
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

1160
01:10:38,504 --> 01:10:39,562
if he's killed on a train.

1161
01:10:39,639 --> 01:10:41,539
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1162
01:10:41,607 --> 01:10:45,600
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

1163
01:10:45,678 --> 01:10:48,340
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1164
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:51,315
One out of I don't know
how many billions.

1165
01:10:52,084 --> 01:10:56,748
And add to that the broken leg.
No, it just can't be the way it looks.

1166
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:01,317
- Something has been worked on us.
- Such as what?

1167
01:11:09,335 --> 01:11:10,529
Murder?

1168
01:11:11,037 --> 01:11:12,902
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

1169
01:11:12,972 --> 01:11:15,770
- Sorry. Want a little soda water?
- No, no, no.

1170
01:11:17,143 --> 01:11:18,132
Who do you suspect?

1171
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,144
Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

1172
01:11:20,212 --> 01:11:22,237
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

1173
01:11:22,315 --> 01:11:23,407
- You mean the wife?
- Yeah.

1174
01:11:23,482 --> 01:11:26,042
That wide-eyed dame that just
didn't know anything about anything.

1175
01:11:26,118 --> 01:11:28,143
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1176
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,482
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1177
01:11:29,555 --> 01:11:31,785
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

1178
01:11:31,857 --> 01:11:34,291
but all I know is that
it was worked.

1179
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,089
I've got to
get to a drugstore.

1180
01:11:36,162 --> 01:11:39,131
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1181
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:41,894
- Good night, Walter.
- Good night, Keyes.

1182
01:11:42,234 --> 01:11:45,169
- See you at the office in the morning.
- Yeah.

1183
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:48,799
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

1184
01:11:48,874 --> 01:11:53,038
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

1185
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:55,774
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

1186
01:11:55,848 --> 01:11:57,406
They'd put her
through the wringer...

1187
01:11:57,483 --> 01:12:00,316
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1188
01:12:00,386 --> 01:12:02,411
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

1189
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:04,786
Oh, not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

1190
01:12:04,857 --> 01:12:09,089
all the percentage there is, and
this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

1191
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,527
Can I have
one of those things?

1192
01:12:24,377 --> 01:12:26,868
- Good night, Keyes.
- So long, Walter.

1193
01:12:40,292 --> 01:12:43,489
- How much does he know?
- He doesn't know anything.

1194
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,291
It's those stinking
hunches of his.

1195
01:12:46,365 --> 01:12:47,696
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

1196
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:51,760
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

1197
01:12:53,773 --> 01:12:56,333
- How long a while?
- Until this dies down.

1198
01:12:56,409 --> 01:12:57,398
You don't know Keyes.

1199
01:12:57,476 --> 01:12:59,535
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1200
01:12:59,612 --> 01:13:01,307
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

1201
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,178
He'll watch you
every minute from now on.

1202
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:06,741
- You afraid, baby?
- Yes, I'm afraid.

1203
01:13:07,853 --> 01:13:11,812
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us.
We're not the same anymore.

1204
01:13:11,891 --> 01:13:15,054
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1205
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:16,890
- Isn't it, Walter?
- What are you talking about?

1206
01:13:16,962 --> 01:13:20,659
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1207
01:13:22,134 --> 01:13:23,624
Shut up, baby.

1208
01:13:27,873 --> 01:13:30,273
<i>Pacific All Risk.</i>
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

1209
01:13:32,577 --> 01:13:34,169
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1210
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,205
- Hello.
- Lola Dietrichson.

1211
01:13:37,582 --> 01:13:40,517
- Don't you remember me?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

1212
01:13:40,652 --> 01:13:42,847
Could I talk with you
just a few minutes?

1213
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:45,355
Somewhere where
we could be alone?

1214
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,785
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1215
01:13:54,132 --> 01:13:56,293
Is it something about
what happened?

1216
01:13:56,368 --> 01:13:59,963
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

1217
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:02,631
I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

1218
01:14:06,378 --> 01:14:08,972
Lou, do you mind if I use the office
alone for a few minutes?

1219
01:14:09,047 --> 01:14:10,947
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1220
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:19,481
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1221
01:14:19,558 --> 01:14:23,016
I'm not crazy. I'm not hysterical.
I'm not even crying.

1222
01:14:24,095 --> 01:14:27,553
But I have the awful feeling
that something's wrong...

1223
01:14:27,866 --> 01:14:31,666
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

1224
01:14:31,736 --> 01:14:32,760
When your mother died?

1225
01:14:32,838 --> 01:14:35,238
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1226
01:14:35,307 --> 01:14:36,296
We had a cabin there.

1227
01:14:36,374 --> 01:14:40,708
It was winter and very cold.
My mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1228
01:14:41,012 --> 01:14:42,741
She had a nurse with her.

1229
01:14:42,848 --> 01:14:45,840
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

1230
01:14:45,951 --> 01:14:48,647
One night I got up
and went into my mother's room.

1231
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,585
She was delirious with fever.

1232
01:14:50,655 --> 01:14:54,352
All the bed covers were on the floor
and the windows were wide open.

1233
01:14:54,459 --> 01:14:55,619
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1234
01:14:55,694 --> 01:14:57,889
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1235
01:14:57,963 --> 01:15:00,693
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

1236
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:03,198
The nurse stood there.

1237
01:15:03,735 --> 01:15:07,364
She didn't say a word,
but there was a look in her eyes...

1238
01:15:07,539 --> 01:15:09,200
I'll never forget.

1239
01:15:11,276 --> 01:15:14,370
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1240
01:15:17,682 --> 01:15:20,014
Do you know who
that nurse was?

1241
01:15:20,218 --> 01:15:21,879
- No. Who?
- Phyllis.

1242
01:15:22,354 --> 01:15:24,720
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1243
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:27,952
He wouldn't listen to me.
Six months later she married him...

1244
01:15:28,026 --> 01:15:32,429
and I kind of talked myself out of the idea
she could have done anything like that.

1245
01:15:32,497 --> 01:15:36,957
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1246
01:15:37,035 --> 01:15:40,869
You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson.
Your father fell off a train.

1247
01:15:40,939 --> 01:15:43,965
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1248
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:46,533
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1249
01:15:46,611 --> 01:15:47,942
pinning a black veil to it.

1250
01:15:48,013 --> 01:15:51,414
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1251
01:15:51,516 --> 01:15:53,541
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1252
01:15:53,618 --> 01:15:55,245
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

1253
01:15:55,353 --> 01:15:56,786
I caught her eyes
in the mirror.

1254
01:15:56,855 --> 01:15:59,881
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1255
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,448
That same look.

1256
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,923
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

1257
01:16:03,995 --> 01:16:05,826
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1258
01:16:05,897 --> 01:16:08,331
I loathe her because she did it.
She did it for the money.

1259
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,732
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1260
01:16:10,802 --> 01:16:13,930
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

1261
01:16:14,005 --> 01:16:15,495
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

1262
01:16:15,574 --> 01:16:19,908
- You'd better be careful, saying things...
- I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1263
01:16:28,219 --> 01:16:29,550
I'm sorry.

1264
01:16:32,924 --> 01:16:35,222
I didn't mean to
act like this.

1265
01:16:36,494 --> 01:16:39,554
All this that you've been telling me,
who else have you told?

1266
01:16:39,631 --> 01:16:40,825
No one.

1267
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:43,457
- How about your stepmother?
- Of course not.

1268
01:16:44,436 --> 01:16:45,960
I've moved out.

1269
01:16:47,072 --> 01:16:49,199
I'm not living
at home anymore.

1270
01:16:49,274 --> 01:16:51,834
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1271
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:54,811
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

1272
01:16:56,414 --> 01:16:58,245
Where are you living now?

1273
01:16:58,316 --> 01:17:01,308
I got myself a little
apartment in Hollywood.

1274
01:17:01,586 --> 01:17:04,555
Four walls, and you just sit
and look at them?

1275
01:17:05,423 --> 01:17:06,913
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1276
01:17:09,761 --> 01:17:11,285
<i>So that evening</i>
<i>I took her to dinner...</i>

1277
01:17:11,363 --> 01:17:15,026
<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera</i>
<i>Street where nobody would see us.</i>

1278
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,091
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1279
01:17:17,502 --> 01:17:20,938
<i>The next day was Sunday and we went</i>
<i>for a ride down to the beach.</i>

1280
01:17:21,006 --> 01:17:23,736
<i>She had loosened up a bit,</i>
<i>she was even laughing.</i>

1281
01:17:23,808 --> 01:17:27,369
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell</i>
<i>that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

1282
01:17:27,445 --> 01:17:30,380
<i>It was dynamite,</i>
<i>whether it was true or not.</i>

1283
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:32,413
<i>And I had no chance</i>
<i>to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1284
01:17:32,484 --> 01:17:34,679
<i>You were watching her</i>
<i>like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1285
01:17:34,753 --> 01:17:39,087
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I</i>
<i>was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

1286
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:43,283
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my</i>
<i>desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

1287
01:17:43,361 --> 01:17:46,330
<i>For a minute I wondered</i>
<i>if it could be about Lola.</i>

1288
01:17:46,398 --> 01:17:47,865
<i>It was worse.</i>

1289
01:17:48,433 --> 01:17:52,392
<i>Outside your door was the last guy</i>
<i>in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1290
01:18:01,546 --> 01:18:03,537
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1291
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,951
- Hello, Keyes.
- I want to ask you something.

1292
01:18:08,386 --> 01:18:10,251
After all the years
we've known each other...

1293
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:12,255
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1294
01:18:12,323 --> 01:18:13,915
- About what?
- About me.

1295
01:18:14,526 --> 01:18:17,188
- Walter, I'm a very great man.
- Yeah?

1296
01:18:17,262 --> 01:18:20,026
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1297
01:18:20,098 --> 01:18:22,089
and murders don't come
any neater.

1298
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:25,034
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1299
01:18:25,103 --> 01:18:27,367
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1300
01:18:28,273 --> 01:18:30,741
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

1301
01:18:30,809 --> 01:18:34,643
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

1302
01:18:34,713 --> 01:18:37,443
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- You know what?

1303
01:18:37,816 --> 01:18:40,751
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1304
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,945
- He wasn't?
- No, he wasn't.

1305
01:18:45,523 --> 01:18:47,821
Now look, Walter.
You can't be sure of killing a man...

1306
01:18:47,892 --> 01:18:51,020
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1307
01:18:51,096 --> 01:18:53,564
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1308
01:18:53,631 --> 01:18:55,565
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

1309
01:18:55,633 --> 01:18:57,828
Now that would mean
either killing him on the train...

1310
01:18:57,902 --> 01:19:01,633
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1311
01:19:01,706 --> 01:19:02,900
and put him on the tracks.

1312
01:19:02,974 --> 01:19:06,239
Two possibilities,
and I personally buy the second.

1313
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:09,003
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

1314
01:19:09,114 --> 01:19:10,877
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1315
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:14,812
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1316
01:19:15,086 --> 01:19:18,487
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1317
01:19:18,556 --> 01:19:20,319
then the somebody
else jumped off...

1318
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:22,951
then they put the body on the tracks
where the train had passed.

1319
01:19:23,027 --> 01:19:25,689
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1320
01:19:26,498 --> 01:19:28,625
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1321
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,224
they have the crutches
to stare at...

1322
01:19:30,301 --> 01:19:32,769
they never really looked
at the man at all.

1323
01:19:32,837 --> 01:19:34,998
Fancy all right, Keyes,
but maybe it's a little too fancy.

1324
01:19:35,073 --> 01:19:38,440
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1325
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:41,010
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1326
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:43,980
The only guy who really got a good look
at this supposed Dietrichson...

1327
01:19:44,048 --> 01:19:46,175
is sitting
right outside my office.

1328
01:19:46,251 --> 01:19:49,687
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1329
01:19:51,422 --> 01:19:54,255
- Come here, Mr. Jackson.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1330
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:56,020
These are fine cigars
you smoke.

1331
01:19:56,094 --> 01:19:57,823
- Two for a quarter.
- That's what I said.

1332
01:19:57,896 --> 01:19:59,454
Well, did you study
those photographs?

1333
01:19:59,531 --> 01:20:01,556
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1334
01:20:01,633 --> 01:20:03,464
- Very thoroughly.
- Have you made up your mind?

1335
01:20:03,535 --> 01:20:05,526
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1336
01:20:05,603 --> 01:20:07,764
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1337
01:20:07,839 --> 01:20:10,865
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1338
01:20:10,942 --> 01:20:13,172
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1339
01:20:13,244 --> 01:20:14,233
Yes.

1340
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,974
- Then my answer is no.
- What do you mean, no?

1341
01:20:17,048 --> 01:20:19,243
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1342
01:20:19,317 --> 01:20:20,511
Will you swear to that?

1343
01:20:20,585 --> 01:20:22,576
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1344
01:20:22,654 --> 01:20:25,020
If I say it, I mean it.
If I mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1345
01:20:25,089 --> 01:20:26,716
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1346
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:28,452
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1347
01:20:28,526 --> 01:20:30,517
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
- Pleased, indeed.

1348
01:20:30,595 --> 01:20:31,960
- How are you?
- Very fine, thank you.

1349
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:34,396
- Never was better.
- Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1350
01:20:34,465 --> 01:20:37,832
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1351
01:20:37,902 --> 01:20:40,632
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1352
01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:43,707
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1353
01:20:43,775 --> 01:20:45,800
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1354
01:20:45,877 --> 01:20:48,277
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1355
01:20:48,346 --> 01:20:51,213
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1356
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:53,940
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1357
01:20:54,018 --> 01:20:56,282
Come to think of it,
he tried to keep his back towards me.

1358
01:20:56,354 --> 01:20:58,982
- But I'm positive just the same.
- Thank you, Jackson.

1359
01:20:59,057 --> 01:21:01,491
Of course, you understand
this matter is strictly confidential?

1360
01:21:01,559 --> 01:21:04,653
We may need you again down here in
Los Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1361
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:07,493
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1362
01:21:07,565 --> 01:21:10,864
- Expenses paid, of course.
- Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1363
01:21:12,437 --> 01:21:15,065
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1364
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:17,799
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1365
01:21:17,876 --> 01:21:21,972
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1366
01:21:22,046 --> 01:21:24,844
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1367
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:26,679
the Dietrichson claim.

1368
01:21:27,752 --> 01:21:29,879
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

1369
01:21:29,954 --> 01:21:31,046
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1370
01:21:31,122 --> 01:21:32,146
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1371
01:21:32,223 --> 01:21:33,747
No. Never been up there.

1372
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:36,552
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1373
01:21:36,628 --> 01:21:40,291
- Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way.
- Nope. I don't fish.

1374
01:21:40,598 --> 01:21:43,897
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1375
01:21:44,435 --> 01:21:47,029
- There's a family of Neffs
in Corvallis. - No relation.

1376
01:21:47,105 --> 01:21:49,505
Let me see. This man's
an automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1377
01:21:49,574 --> 01:21:51,906
- A very reputable man, too, I'm told.
- All right, Mr. Jackson.

1378
01:21:51,976 --> 01:21:53,500
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1379
01:21:53,578 --> 01:21:55,045
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1380
01:21:55,113 --> 01:21:58,412
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1381
01:21:58,483 --> 01:21:59,472
Tonight?

1382
01:21:59,584 --> 01:22:02,815
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1383
01:22:02,887 --> 01:22:05,685
- I'd like to see before I leave.
- Osteopath?

1384
01:22:06,224 --> 01:22:09,284
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1385
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:11,718
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1386
01:22:11,796 --> 01:22:14,094
- It's been a pleasure.
- Goodbye.

1387
01:22:16,401 --> 01:22:20,337
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1388
01:22:20,405 --> 01:22:23,135
Murder's never perfect.
Always comes apart sooner or later.

1389
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:25,675
And when two people are involved,
it's usually sooner.

1390
01:22:25,743 --> 01:22:28,644
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1391
01:22:28,713 --> 01:22:30,738
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1392
01:22:30,815 --> 01:22:33,682
He'll show. He's got to show.
Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet.

1393
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:35,048
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

1394
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:38,555
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1395
01:22:38,623 --> 01:22:41,091
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1396
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:42,558
But it isn't twice as safe.

1397
01:22:42,627 --> 01:22:45,790
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1398
01:22:45,863 --> 01:22:47,990
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1399
01:22:48,066 --> 01:22:49,829
where they can get off
at different stops.

1400
01:22:49,901 --> 01:22:52,165
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1401
01:22:52,236 --> 01:22:53,703
all the way to
the end of the line.

1402
01:22:53,771 --> 01:22:56,103
And it's a one-way trip,
and the last stop is the cemetery.

1403
01:22:56,174 --> 01:22:57,971
She put in her claim.

1404
01:22:58,609 --> 01:23:01,203
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

1405
01:23:06,784 --> 01:23:08,547
Let her sue us if she dares.

1406
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:11,417
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

1407
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:14,014
They'll be digging
their own graves.

1408
01:23:22,467 --> 01:23:25,129
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1409
01:23:25,203 --> 01:23:28,195
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1410
01:23:28,272 --> 01:23:31,833
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1411
01:23:58,903 --> 01:24:01,531
- Hello, Walter.
- Come over here.

1412
01:24:05,243 --> 01:24:08,178
- What's the matter?
- Everything's the matter.

1413
01:24:10,214 --> 01:24:11,545
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1414
01:24:11,616 --> 01:24:14,210
He's sitting back with his
mouth watering, waiting for you to sue.

1415
01:24:14,285 --> 01:24:16,082
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1416
01:24:16,154 --> 01:24:19,055
- What's he got to stop me?
- He's got plenty.

1417
01:24:21,926 --> 01:24:23,291
He's figured out how
it was worked.

1418
01:24:23,361 --> 01:24:25,158
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1419
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:27,060
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1420
01:24:27,131 --> 01:24:29,497
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1421
01:24:29,567 --> 01:24:33,059
Yeah? And then you're in court and a lot
of other things are going to come up.

1422
01:24:33,137 --> 01:24:36,971
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1423
01:24:37,141 --> 01:24:38,972
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1424
01:24:39,043 --> 01:24:40,067
The way she died.

1425
01:24:40,144 --> 01:24:43,170
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1426
01:24:43,247 --> 01:24:45,010
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1427
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:47,415
- She's been seeing you. - I've been
seeing her, if you want to know.

1428
01:24:47,485 --> 01:24:49,180
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1429
01:24:49,253 --> 01:24:51,983
She's putting on an act for you,
crying all over your shoulder, the lying...

1430
01:24:52,056 --> 01:24:54,388
Keep her out of this. All I'm telling you
is we're not going to sue.

1431
01:24:54,459 --> 01:24:55,653
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1432
01:24:55,726 --> 01:24:56,920
even if you could have it,
because she's...

1433
01:24:56,994 --> 01:24:58,188
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

1434
01:24:58,262 --> 01:25:01,527
It isn't the money anymore. It's our necks.
We're pulling out, do you understand?

1435
01:25:01,599 --> 01:25:04,534
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1436
01:25:04,602 --> 01:25:06,866
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1437
01:25:06,938 --> 01:25:09,805
You're afraid she might find out someday
and you can't take it, can you?

1438
01:25:09,874 --> 01:25:11,808
I said, leave her out of this.

1439
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:18,043
It's me I'm talking about.

1440
01:25:18,116 --> 01:25:20,277
- I don't want to be left out of it.
- Stop saying that.

1441
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:21,750
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

1442
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:24,447
- We can't go through with it, that's all.
- We have gone through with it.

1443
01:25:24,522 --> 01:25:25,614
The tough part
is all behind us.

1444
01:25:25,723 --> 01:25:28,191
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1445
01:25:28,593 --> 01:25:30,993
stick close together
the way we started out.

1446
01:25:31,062 --> 01:25:32,324
Watch it.

1447
01:25:50,114 --> 01:25:52,708
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1448
01:25:52,783 --> 01:25:56,275
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1449
01:25:56,354 --> 01:25:59,983
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1450
01:26:00,558 --> 01:26:03,220
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1451
01:26:03,294 --> 01:26:06,991
- Is that what you're telling me?
- And nobody's pulling out.

1452
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:09,725
We went into this together,
we're coming out at the end together.

1453
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,531
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1454
01:26:20,244 --> 01:26:21,905
<i>Yes, I remembered.</i>

1455
01:26:23,247 --> 01:26:26,546
<i>Just like I remembered</i>
<i>what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1456
01:26:26,617 --> 01:26:29,085
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1457
01:26:29,153 --> 01:26:31,553
<i>and how there was no getting off</i>
<i>till the end of the line...</i>

1458
01:26:33,191 --> 01:26:35,091
...where the cemetery was.

1459
01:26:36,527 --> 01:26:39,792
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1460
01:26:40,464 --> 01:26:42,694
They're to put dead people in.

1461
01:26:44,435 --> 01:26:48,098
I guess that was the first time
I ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1462
01:26:48,172 --> 01:26:49,696
Dead, I mean.

1463
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:53,469
And how it would be
if she were dead.

1464
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:57,577
<i>I saw Lola three or four times</i>
<i>that week.</i>

1465
01:26:58,249 --> 01:27:02,083
<i>One night we went up into the hills</i>
<i>behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

1466
01:27:02,286 --> 01:27:05,119
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,</i>
<i>but it was only with her that...</i>

1467
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:07,623
<i>I could relax</i>
<i>and let go a little.</i>

1468
01:27:37,788 --> 01:27:39,517
Why are you crying?

1469
01:27:41,425 --> 01:27:43,655
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1470
01:27:43,828 --> 01:27:47,730
Of course I will, Walter.
I wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1471
01:27:48,966 --> 01:27:51,867
- It's about Nino.
- Zachetti? What about him?

1472
01:27:52,036 --> 01:27:54,903
They killed my father together.
He and Phyllis.

1473
01:27:54,972 --> 01:27:57,463
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1474
01:27:58,276 --> 01:28:00,244
What makes you say that?

1475
01:28:00,645 --> 01:28:03,944
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1476
01:28:04,015 --> 01:28:06,415
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

1477
01:28:06,684 --> 01:28:10,745
Maybe he was just going with me as
a blind. And the night of the murder...

1478
01:28:10,821 --> 01:28:12,914
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1479
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:16,517
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1480
01:28:16,594 --> 01:28:19,495
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1481
01:28:20,298 --> 01:28:21,390
Sick!

1482
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:27,870
He couldn't show up, because the train
was leaving with my father on it.

1483
01:28:33,477 --> 01:28:36,776
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1484
01:28:37,815 --> 01:28:39,840
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1485
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:44,013
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1486
01:28:50,394 --> 01:28:53,795
<i>Zachetti.</i>
<i>Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

1487
01:28:55,499 --> 01:28:59,560
<i>What was he doing up at her house?</i>
<i>I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

1488
01:29:01,205 --> 01:29:04,299
<i>I tried to make sense out of it</i>
<i>and got nowhere.</i>

1489
01:29:04,809 --> 01:29:07,801
<i>But the real braintwister</i>
<i>came the next day.</i>

1490
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:12,375
<i>You sprang it on me, Keyes,</i>
<i>after office hours, when you caught me...</i>

1491
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:14,350
<i>down in the lobby</i>
<i>of the building.</i>

1492
01:29:14,418 --> 01:29:16,648
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1493
01:29:21,292 --> 01:29:24,318
- Hello, Keyes.
- Just hang on to your hat, Walter.

1494
01:29:24,395 --> 01:29:26,363
- What for?
- Oh, nothing much.

1495
01:29:26,597 --> 01:29:29,498
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

1496
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:32,793
- How do you mean?
- The guy showed. That's how.

1497
01:29:34,004 --> 01:29:36,234
- What guy?
- The guy who helped her do it.

1498
01:29:36,307 --> 01:29:38,002
The somebody else?

1499
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:41,605
- No kidding?
- Yeah. She just filed suit against us.

1500
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:42,976
It's okay by me.

1501
01:29:43,047 --> 01:29:46,107
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1502
01:29:46,183 --> 01:29:48,413
- Come on. I'll buy you a martini, Walter.
- No thanks, Keyes.

1503
01:29:48,486 --> 01:29:49,475
With two olives.

1504
01:29:49,553 --> 01:29:51,851
No, I've got to get a shave
and a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1505
01:29:51,922 --> 01:29:55,016
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

1506
01:29:55,626 --> 01:29:57,355
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1507
01:29:57,428 --> 01:29:58,725
All you have to do is
ask for them.

1508
01:29:58,796 --> 01:30:02,926
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1509
01:30:07,271 --> 01:30:09,296
<i>I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

1510
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:12,440
<i>Maybe you were playing</i>
<i>cat-and-mouse with me.</i>

1511
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:15,673
<i>Maybe you knew all along</i>
<i>I was the somebody else.</i>

1512
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:20,278
<i>I had to find out, and I knew</i>
<i>where to look. In your office.</i>

1513
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,340
<i>Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

1514
01:30:54,418 --> 01:30:56,079
<i>Confidential.</i>
<i>Dietrichson file.</i>

1515
01:30:56,887 --> 01:30:59,651
<i>With regard to your proposal</i>
<i>to put Walter Neff under surveillance...</i>

1516
01:30:59,723 --> 01:31:01,418
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

1517
01:31:01,492 --> 01:31:03,858
<i>I have investigated his</i>
<i>movements on the night of the crime...</i>

1518
01:31:03,928 --> 01:31:07,762
<i>and he's definitely placed</i>
<i>in his apartment from 7.15 p.m. on.</i>

1519
01:31:08,365 --> 01:31:11,801
<i>In addition to this, I have known</i>
<i>Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

1520
01:31:11,869 --> 01:31:15,168
<i>and I personally vouch for him</i>
<i>without reservation.</i>

1521
01:31:20,911 --> 01:31:23,812
<i>Furthermore, no connection whatsoever</i>
<i>has been established...</i>

1522
01:31:23,881 --> 01:31:26,247
<i>between Walter Neff and</i>
<i>Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

1523
01:31:26,317 --> 01:31:30,117
<i>whereas I am now able to report that</i>
<i>such a connection has been established...</i>

1524
01:31:30,187 --> 01:31:32,314
<i>between her and another man.</i>

1525
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:35,357
<i>This man has been observed</i>
<i>to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

1526
01:31:35,426 --> 01:31:38,793
<i>on the nights of July 9th,</i>
<i>10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

1527
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:43,261
<i>We have succeeded in</i>
<i>identifying him as one Nino Zachetti...</i>

1528
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:45,858
<i>former medical student,</i>
<i>age of 28...</i>

1529
01:31:45,936 --> 01:31:48,200
<i>residing at</i>
<i>Lilac Court Apartments...</i>

1530
01:31:48,272 --> 01:31:51,173
<i>12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.</i>

1531
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:55,167
<i>We have checked Zachetti's movements</i>
<i>on the night of the crime...</i>

1532
01:31:55,246 --> 01:31:58,044
<i>and have found that</i>
<i>they cannot be accounted for.</i>

1533
01:31:58,482 --> 01:32:01,713
<i>I am preparing a more detailed report</i>
<i>for your consideration.</i>

1534
01:32:01,785 --> 01:32:05,482
<i>It is my belief that we already have</i>
<i>sufficient evidence against Zachetti...</i>

1535
01:32:05,556 --> 01:32:08,616
<i>and Mrs. Dietrichson</i>
<i>to justify police action.</i>

1536
01:32:08,893 --> 01:32:11,885
<i>I strongly urge that this whole matter</i>
<i>be turned over to the office...</i>

1537
01:32:11,962 --> 01:32:13,896
<i>of the district attorney.</i>

1538
01:32:13,964 --> 01:32:16,057
<i>Respectfully, Barton Keyes.</i>

1539
01:32:52,236 --> 01:32:55,967
Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.

1540
01:32:57,408 --> 01:32:59,433
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1541
01:33:00,044 --> 01:33:01,443
How's 11:00?

1542
01:33:02,613 --> 01:33:04,410
Don't worry about Keyes.

1543
01:33:04,481 --> 01:33:07,450
Just leave the front door unlocked
and put the lights out.

1544
01:33:07,518 --> 01:33:10,453
No, nobody's watching
the house. Not anymore.

1545
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:15,014
It's just for the neighbors.
I told you not to worry about Keyes.

1546
01:33:16,093 --> 01:33:18,994
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

1547
01:33:20,798 --> 01:33:22,288
Goodbye, baby.

1548
01:33:26,236 --> 01:33:27,965
<i>I guess I don't have to</i>
<i>tell you...</i>

1549
01:33:28,038 --> 01:33:30,700
<i>what I intended to do</i>
<i>at 11.00, Keyes.</i>

1550
01:33:30,774 --> 01:33:34,335
<i>For the first time, I saw a way to get</i>
<i>clear of the whole mess I was in...</i>

1551
01:33:34,411 --> 01:33:37,244
<i>and of Phyllis, too,</i>
<i>all at the same time.</i>

1552
01:33:37,581 --> 01:33:39,708
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

1553
01:33:40,351 --> 01:33:43,718
<i>What I didn't know was that</i>
<i>she had plans of her own.</i>

1554
01:34:43,213 --> 01:34:44,805
In here, Walter.

1555
01:34:59,663 --> 01:35:01,062
Hello, baby.

1556
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,996
- Anybody else in the house?
- Nobody. Why?

1557
01:35:07,538 --> 01:35:10,439
- What's that music?
- A radio up the street.

1558
01:35:18,949 --> 01:35:21,884
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1559
01:35:21,952 --> 01:35:24,785
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

1560
01:35:25,155 --> 01:35:27,680
Only you were thinking
about murder.

1561
01:35:28,759 --> 01:35:30,659
I was thinking about
that anklet.

1562
01:35:30,728 --> 01:35:32,593
And what are you
thinking about now?

1563
01:35:32,663 --> 01:35:34,961
I'm all through thinking,
baby.

1564
01:35:35,165 --> 01:35:37,429
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?

1565
01:35:37,668 --> 01:35:41,661
- Where are you going? - You're
the one that's going, baby. Not me.

1566
01:35:41,939 --> 01:35:44,533
I'm getting off the trolley car
right at this corner.

1567
01:35:44,608 --> 01:35:47,099
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1568
01:35:47,177 --> 01:35:50,613
All right, I'll tell you.
A friend of mine's got a funny theory.

1569
01:35:51,014 --> 01:35:53,983
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1570
01:35:54,051 --> 01:35:56,679
on a trolley car together.
One can't get off without the other.

1571
01:35:56,754 --> 01:35:59,052
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1572
01:35:59,123 --> 01:36:01,421
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

1573
01:36:01,492 --> 01:36:03,790
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

1574
01:36:03,861 --> 01:36:07,024
- Maybe he's got something there.
- You bet he has.

1575
01:36:07,131 --> 01:36:09,861
Two people are gonna ride
to the end of the line, all right.

1576
01:36:09,933 --> 01:36:14,370
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1577
01:36:14,438 --> 01:36:17,896
- Just who are you talking about?
- An acquaintance of yours.

1578
01:36:17,975 --> 01:36:19,306
A Mr. Zachetti.

1579
01:36:19,376 --> 01:36:21,173
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1580
01:36:21,245 --> 01:36:23,873
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1581
01:36:23,947 --> 01:36:24,971
I was a sucker.

1582
01:36:25,048 --> 01:36:27,812
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1583
01:36:27,885 --> 01:36:30,547
- Nobody wanted to brush you off.
- Save it. I'm telling this.

1584
01:36:30,988 --> 01:36:33,047
It's been you and that
Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?

1585
01:36:33,123 --> 01:36:34,715
That's not true.

1586
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:37,920
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1587
01:36:39,196 --> 01:36:42,688
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1588
01:36:42,766 --> 01:36:45,826
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1589
01:36:45,903 --> 01:36:49,270
- What's happening to me all this time?
- Don't be silly, baby.

1590
01:36:54,545 --> 01:36:58,709
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1591
01:36:58,782 --> 01:37:00,079
That's what Keyes thinks.

1592
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:02,414
And what's good enough
for Keyes is good enough for me.

1593
01:37:02,486 --> 01:37:06,820
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1594
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:08,755
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1595
01:37:08,892 --> 01:37:13,386
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1596
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:17,757
And if it was you, they'd charge that up
to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1597
01:37:17,835 --> 01:37:21,532
Sure they would, and that's just
what's gonna happen, baby.

1598
01:37:21,972 --> 01:37:24,463
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1599
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:27,999
With the cops right behind him.
It's all taken care of.

1600
01:37:29,112 --> 01:37:31,376
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1601
01:37:31,448 --> 01:37:35,350
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1602
01:37:35,419 --> 01:37:36,886
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

1603
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:40,180
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1604
01:37:40,257 --> 01:37:42,589
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1605
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:44,092
so we can get the money
and be together.

1606
01:37:44,494 --> 01:37:47,622
- That's cute. Say it again. - He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

1607
01:37:47,698 --> 01:37:49,757
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1608
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:51,824
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1609
01:37:51,902 --> 01:37:54,097
I kept hammering into him
that she was with another man...

1610
01:37:54,171 --> 01:37:58,574
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1611
01:37:58,642 --> 01:38:01,338
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1612
01:38:01,411 --> 01:38:05,472
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1613
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:08,011
We're both rotten.

1614
01:38:08,118 --> 01:38:09,779
Only you're
a little more rotten.

1615
01:38:09,853 --> 01:38:11,946
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1616
01:38:12,022 --> 01:38:15,549
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1617
01:38:15,626 --> 01:38:18,686
Then somebody else would have come along
to take care of Zachetti for you.

1618
01:38:18,762 --> 01:38:21,458
- That's the way you operate,
isn't it, baby? - Suppose it is.

1619
01:38:21,531 --> 01:38:24,830
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1620
01:38:25,669 --> 01:38:29,366
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1621
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:52,595
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1622
01:38:52,829 --> 01:38:54,592
Better try it again.

1623
01:38:57,367 --> 01:38:59,699
Maybe if I came
a little closer?

1624
01:39:10,213 --> 01:39:12,704
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1625
01:39:21,725 --> 01:39:24,125
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

1626
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:33,792
Don't tell me it's because you've been
in love with me all this time.

1627
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:37,328
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1628
01:39:37,574 --> 01:39:40,805
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1629
01:39:40,877 --> 01:39:43,311
That's all you
ever meant to me...

1630
01:39:44,481 --> 01:39:46,210
until a minute ago...

1631
01:39:47,351 --> 01:39:49,979
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

1632
01:39:51,588 --> 01:39:54,318
I never thought
that could happen to me.

1633
01:39:55,325 --> 01:39:57,885
- Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
- I'm not asking you to buy.

1634
01:39:57,961 --> 01:39:59,690
Just hold me close.

1635
01:40:06,136 --> 01:40:07,626
Goodbye, baby.

1636
01:41:02,259 --> 01:41:03,521
Zachetti.

1637
01:41:05,695 --> 01:41:07,026
Come here.

1638
01:41:12,903 --> 01:41:14,564
I said, come here.

1639
01:41:17,307 --> 01:41:20,333
- My name is Neff.
- Yeah, and I still don't like it.

1640
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:22,037
What do you want?

1641
01:41:22,112 --> 01:41:23,409
Look, kid.

1642
01:41:24,581 --> 01:41:27,846
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1643
01:41:28,018 --> 01:41:30,077
- What's the gag?
- Suppose you go on back down the hill...

1644
01:41:30,153 --> 01:41:31,745
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

1645
01:41:31,822 --> 01:41:33,915
Keep your nickel and buy yourself
an ice-cream cone.

1646
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:35,753
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1647
01:41:35,826 --> 01:41:38,386
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1648
01:41:38,462 --> 01:41:39,554
She isn't worth a nickel.

1649
01:41:39,629 --> 01:41:42,120
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1650
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:43,223
Tough, aren't you?

1651
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,325
Here, take the nickel
and call her. She wants you to.

1652
01:41:45,402 --> 01:41:47,165
She doesn't want
any part of me.

1653
01:41:47,437 --> 01:41:49,997
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1654
01:41:50,073 --> 01:41:52,598
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1655
01:41:52,676 --> 01:41:54,906
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1656
01:41:54,978 --> 01:41:58,243
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1657
01:41:58,915 --> 01:42:00,507
Go on. That way.

1658
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,921
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1659
01:42:14,297 --> 01:42:15,355
It's cold.

1660
01:42:17,434 --> 01:42:21,029
I wonder if she's still lying alone
up there in that house...

1661
01:42:21,104 --> 01:42:23,231
or if they've found her
by now.

1662
01:42:24,908 --> 01:42:28,207
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1663
01:42:32,482 --> 01:42:35,474
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1664
01:42:36,353 --> 01:42:41,290
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1665
01:42:42,959 --> 01:42:46,656
And I want you to take care of her
and that guy Zachetti...

1666
01:42:51,268 --> 01:42:54,066
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1667
01:42:56,039 --> 01:42:57,506
Hello, Keyes.

1668
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:09,577
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1669
01:43:11,021 --> 01:43:14,354
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1670
01:43:15,091 --> 01:43:18,254
Or did that little man of yours
pull you out of bed?

1671
01:43:18,328 --> 01:43:19,920
The janitor did.

1672
01:43:20,764 --> 01:43:23,392
Seems you leaked a little blood
on the way in here.

1673
01:43:23,466 --> 01:43:24,558
Yeah.

1674
01:43:25,035 --> 01:43:26,900
Wouldn't be surprised.

1675
01:43:28,338 --> 01:43:31,899
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1676
01:43:32,275 --> 01:43:33,674
So I gather.

1677
01:43:35,345 --> 01:43:38,712
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

1678
01:43:38,782 --> 01:43:41,774
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1679
01:43:42,686 --> 01:43:44,677
One you didn't
quite figure out.

1680
01:43:44,754 --> 01:43:47,188
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1681
01:43:47,824 --> 01:43:50,554
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1682
01:43:51,828 --> 01:43:54,422
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

1683
01:43:55,465 --> 01:43:58,400
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

1684
01:43:59,603 --> 01:44:01,400
Let's have it, Keyes.

1685
01:44:02,772 --> 01:44:05,969
Walter, you're all washed up.

1686
01:44:08,578 --> 01:44:11,103
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1687
01:44:12,449 --> 01:44:14,576
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1688
01:44:16,786 --> 01:44:19,414
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1689
01:44:20,490 --> 01:44:23,152
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1690
01:44:23,226 --> 01:44:26,627
So I can walk into that gas chamber up
at San Quentin on my own power?

1691
01:44:26,696 --> 01:44:28,288
Is that it, Keyes?

1692
01:44:28,365 --> 01:44:30,026
Something like that.

1693
01:44:31,001 --> 01:44:33,299
- I've got a different idea.
- Yeah?

1694
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:34,735
Look, Keyes.

1695
01:44:35,105 --> 01:44:37,505
Suppose you went back to bed
and didn't find these cylinders...

1696
01:44:37,574 --> 01:44:39,940
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1697
01:44:40,010 --> 01:44:42,604
After that you can
play it any way you like.

1698
01:44:42,679 --> 01:44:45,273
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

1699
01:44:45,548 --> 01:44:49,484
- Give me one good reason. - I need
four hours to get where I'm going.

1700
01:44:49,552 --> 01:44:52,749
- You're not going anywhere, Walter.
- You bet I am.

1701
01:44:53,657 --> 01:44:56,558
- I'm going across the border.
- You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1702
01:44:56,626 --> 01:44:58,184
Good enough to try for.

1703
01:44:58,261 --> 01:45:01,697
- You'll never make the border.
- That's what you think.

1704
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:03,889
Just watch me.

1705
01:45:04,334 --> 01:45:06,495
You'll never even make
the elevator.

1706
01:45:06,736 --> 01:45:07,725
So long, Keyes.

1707
01:45:37,367 --> 01:45:38,664
Hello...

1708
01:45:38,735 --> 01:45:41,363
send an ambulance to
the Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1709
01:45:43,573 --> 01:45:45,541
Yeah. It's a police job.

1710
01:46:05,362 --> 01:46:07,922
- How you doing, Walter?
- Fine.

1711
01:46:10,166 --> 01:46:13,693
Only somebody moved the elevator
a couple of miles away.

1712
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:15,999
They're on the way.

1713
01:46:20,343 --> 01:46:22,971
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1714
01:46:23,046 --> 01:46:24,536
I'll tell you.

1715
01:46:25,081 --> 01:46:28,346
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1716
01:46:28,418 --> 01:46:31,046
He was right across
the desk from you.

1717
01:46:31,254 --> 01:46:33,245
Closer than that, Walter.

1718
01:46:37,394 --> 01:46:38,918
I love you, too.

1719
01:46:45,394 --> 01:46:55,918
