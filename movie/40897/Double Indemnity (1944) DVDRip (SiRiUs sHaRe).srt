Dear Keyes...

00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:58,254
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

Well, I don't like
the word confession.

You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

and for a woman.

50
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:27,801

Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

119
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:56,466
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

120
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,010
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

121
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:01,304
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

122
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:03,306
I suppose so. But he's
never home much before 8:00.

123
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,724
That's fine with me.

124
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:06,810
You're not connected with
the Automobile Club, are you?

125
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:09,270
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

126
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:12,315
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

127
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,235
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.

128
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:16,361
No, he isn't.

129
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:19,572
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

130
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:22,367
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:26,371
The Automobile Club's fine. I can
do just as well for you, though.

132
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,665
I have a very attractive
policy here.

133
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:31,376
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

134
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,045
For instance, we're writing a new
kind of 50% retention feature...

135
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:36,130
in the collision coverage.

You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:41,719
Well, I've been at it 11
years. Doing pretty well?

138
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:43,179
It's a living.

139
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,475
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

140
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:50,978
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

141
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:53,481
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

142
00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:54,899

I think I like that.
But you're not sure?

149
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:15,294
I'd have to drive it around

Mr. Neff, why don't you drop

151
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:20,049
He'll be in then.
Who?

152
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:23,344
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:26,305
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

154
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:27,765
if you know what I mean.

155
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:31,268
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

156
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,563
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.

157
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:37,274
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

158
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,568
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

159
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:41,403
Suppose it doesn't take.

160
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:43,823
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

161
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:46,784
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

162
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,995
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

163
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,538
That tears it.

164
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:59,254
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
That's what I suggested.

165
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:01,965
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.

166
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:04,385
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

167
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,470
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

168
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:09,390
I wonder if you wonder.

169
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,437
<i>(Walter) It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...</i>

170
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:18,440
<i>the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.</i>

171
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:22,736
<i>How could I have known that murder
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

172
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:24,029
<i>Maybe you would
have known, Keyes...</i>

173
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:27,741
<i>the minute she mentioned
accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

174
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:29,660
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

175
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,622
<i>I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.</i>

176
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:37,000
<i>It was the day you had that truck
driver from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

177
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:38,377
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

178
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,837
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

179
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,798
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

180
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,841
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

181
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:46,927
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

182
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:53,433
Hello, Walter.
Hi, George.

183
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,686
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

184
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,605
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

185
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:00,732
You're in a jam and
you know it. Says you.

186
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:03,068
All I want is my money. Says you.

187
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:05,737
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

188
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:08,990
This is Sam Garlopis from
Inglewood. Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

189
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:11,993
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

190
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:16,331
I ain't so good. My truck burned
down. Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

191
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:19,584
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

192
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:21,961
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

193
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:25,006
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

194
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:29,135
What little man?
The little man in here.

195
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:32,430
Every time one of these phonies comes
along, it ties knots in my stomach.

196
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:33,932
I can't eat.

197
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:37,227
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's
how I knew your claim was crooked.

198
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,811
So what did I do?

199
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:41,481
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

200
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:43,441
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

201
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,026
And what did they find?

202
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:48,404
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

203
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:50,031
What shavings?

204
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:53,660
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

205
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:59,415
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor
guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

206
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:01,793
That's one way
of putting it.

207
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,128
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

208
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,422
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

209
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:09,342
Sign what? It's a waiver
on your claim. Right here.

210
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:11,969
Here?
Here.

211
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:18,726
Now you're an honest man
again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

212
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,728
But I ain't got no more truck.

213
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:23,189
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

214
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:25,775
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't
you know how to open the door?

215
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:29,111
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

216
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:31,989
Now pull it toward you.

217
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:36,744
That's the boy.
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

218
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,374
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

219
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,169
Are we an insurance company, or
just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

220
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:46,462
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

221
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,172
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

222
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,798
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

223
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:50,883
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

224
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,676
before we accepted the risk.
I know you did, Walter.

225
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,429
I'm not beefing at you. It's the
company. It's the way they do things.

226
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:56,597
The way they don't do things!

227
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,391
The way they'll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet.

228
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:01,936
And I'm the guy that has to sit
here up to my neck in phony claims...

229
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,980
so they won't throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door.

230
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:06,857
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

231
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,277
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick
up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

232
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:12,029
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

233
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,989
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

234
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:16,617
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

235
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,660
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

236
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:22,581
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

237
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:25,000
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

238
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,794
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

239
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:30,464
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

240
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:31,924
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

241
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,801
<i>and find out if their calendar checked
with the World Almanac's calendar.</i>

242
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:36,053
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

243
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,348
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

244
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:42,726
[Flicking match]

245
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,394
I love you, too.

246
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:53,361
<i>(Walter) I really did,
too, you old crab...</i>

247
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:56,740
<i>always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.</i>

248
00:15:56,948 --> 00:16:00,619
<i>But you never fooled me with your
song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

249
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:03,163
<i>I kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

250
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:05,624
<i>you had a heart
as big as a house.</i>

251
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,835
<i>Back in my office there was a phone
message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

252
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,629
<i>about the renewals.</i>

253
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,924
<i>She didn't want me to come
tomorrow evening.</i>

254
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,677
<i>She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.</i>

255
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,514
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

256
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:23,516
<i>including a trip
down to Santa Monica...</i>

257
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,353
<i>to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.</i>

258
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:30,523
<i>But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

259
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,151
<i>and the way that anklet
of hers cut into her leg.</i>

260
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:43,244
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

261
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:45,872
I'm considering it.

262
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:50,084
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

263
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:53,129
Last night wasn't so
convenient. That's all right.

264
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,298
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

265
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,508
I was just fixing some iced
tea. Would you like a glass?

266
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:59,844
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

267
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:02,513
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

268
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:03,806
Nettie.

269
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:11,397
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

270
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:14,192
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll
renew with you, he told me so.

271
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,819
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

272
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,070
But he's not?
No.

273
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,155
[Chuckles]

274
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,823
That's terrible.

275
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,492
Nettie!

276
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,829
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

277
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,833
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

278
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,169
Lemon? Sugar?
Fix it your way.

279
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:38,466
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

280
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:41,677
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

281
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,555
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

282
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:46,557
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

283
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,352
I didn't think you'd learned
it from a correspondence course.

284
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:54,106
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

285
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,358
You're not English, are you?
No. Californian.

286
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,485
Born right here
in Los Angeles.

287
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:01,655
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

288
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,284
Mr. Neff, I...
Make it Walter, huh?

289
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,202
Walter.
That's right.

290
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,999
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

291
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,667
Twenty percent. Why?

292
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,336
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

293
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,006
I can always use it. I was
thinking about my husband.

294
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:21,508
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

295
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,886
It's very dangerous.
Not for an executive, is it?

296
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:25,345
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

297
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,681
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

298
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:29,016
It's got me worried sick.

299
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:31,393
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

300
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,937
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.

301
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:37,024
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

302
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:39,860
He's in the hospital with
a broken back. That's bad.

303
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:42,446
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

304
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,740
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

305
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,533
It could.
Well...

306
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:51,204
don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.

307
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:54,541
What kind of insurance
could he have?

308
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:56,877
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

309
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,004
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

310
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,465
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

311
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:04,801
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.

312
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:08,013
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

313
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:10,432
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

314
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:11,892
Well, your husband
would understand.

315
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:14,769
I'm sure I could sell him on the
idea of some accident protection.

316
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,396
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

317
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,648
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

318
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,817
They're all tough at first.

319
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,861
He has a lot on his mind.

320
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,654
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

321
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:27,574
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

322
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:31,828
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

323
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:35,540
(Walter) Sounds pretty dull.
So, I just sit and knit.

324
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,251
Is that what you
married him for?

325
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:41,504
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

326
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,215
Anytime his thumbs
get tired...

327
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,676
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

328
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,845
Wouldn't I? You bet
your life, you wouldn't.

329
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:55,351
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

330
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,939
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

331
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:05,778
Could I get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all?

332
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:06,863
How's that, again?

333
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:09,907
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

334
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,534
I have a little
allowance of my own.

335
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:14,787
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

336
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:18,416
Why shouldn't he know?

337
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,918
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

338
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,922
He's superstitious about it. A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

339
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:29,135
If there was a way to get it like
that, all the worry would be over.

340
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:33,180
See what I mean, Walter?
Sure. I got good eyesight.

341
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,975
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

342
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:39,061
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

343
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,939
That's the setup, isn't it? Is
there anything wrong with it?

344
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,357
No, I think it's lovely.

345
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,860
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

346
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:46,986
What crown block?

347
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,156
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

348
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,574
I don't know what
you're talking about.

349
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:53,075
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

350
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:56,245
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

351
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,372
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

352
00:20:58,455 --> 00:21:00,708
Are you crazy?
Not that crazy.

353
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,503
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
What's the matter?

354
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,466
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

355
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:12,928
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

356
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:14,471
That's a horrible
thing to say.

357
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:15,848
What'd you think
I was, anyway?

358
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:18,267
A guy that walks into a good
looking dame's front parlor and says:

359
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,310
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

360
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:21,645
"You got one that's been
around too long?

361
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,397
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

362
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,357
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect. "

363
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:29,069
Boy, what a dope you must think
I am. I think you're rotten.

364
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,363
I think you're swell, so
long as I'm not your husband.

365
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:34,366
Get out of here. You bet
I'll get out of here, baby.

366
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,618
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

367
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:49,047
<i>(Walter) So I let her have
it straight between the eyes.</i>

368
00:21:49,131 --> 00:21:51,633
<i>She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.</i>

369
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:53,343
<i>I knew I had hold
of a red-hot poker...</i>

370
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:56,138
<i>and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.</i>

371
00:21:56,888 --> 00:22:00,767
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer, the one I had wanted all along...</i>

372
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:04,730
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

373
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:06,690
<i>and everything
that went with it.</i>

374
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:09,943
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office
so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

375
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,571
<i>at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...</i>

376
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:15,740
<i>to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.</i>

377
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:20,787
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when
I left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

378
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:24,291
<i>So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.</i>

379
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:28,503
<i>It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...</i>

380
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,630
<i>and didn't even
turn on the light.</i>

381
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:32,507
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

382
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:34,426
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

383
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:37,303
<i>and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.</i>

384
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,433
<i>And right then it came over me that I
hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

385
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:43,977
<i>That the hook
was too strong...</i>

386
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,604
<i>that this wasn't the end
between her and me.</i>

387
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:48,356
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

388
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,440
[Doorbell ringing]

389
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:53,862
<i>So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd
know who it was without even having to think.</i>

390
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:56,865
<i>As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.</i>

391
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:03,579
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

392
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:07,000
Did I? Don't you want me to bring it in?

393
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:08,835
Sure.

394
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:12,338
Put it on the chair.

395
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:23,516
How'd you know where I live?
It's in the phone book.

396
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:26,102
It's raining.
Yeah.

397
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:29,063
Peel off your coat
and sit down.

398
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,234
Your husband out?

399
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:35,278
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

400
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:37,530
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

401
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:40,908
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

402
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:42,410
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

403
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:45,454
Like what?
Like it was this afternoon.

404
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:48,833
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

405
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,794
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

406
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,129
Okay.
No, it's not okay.

407
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:56,048
Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?

408
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:58,759
I want you to be nice to me.

409
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:02,054
Like the first time
you came to the house.

410
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:04,348
It can't be
like the first time.

411
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:07,226
Something's happened.
I know it has.

412
00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:09,812
It's happened to us.

413
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:16,318
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

414
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:20,656
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

415
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:23,242
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

416
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:25,619
Maybe I oughtn't
to have come.

417
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:28,414
Maybe you oughtn't.
You want me to go?

418
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:30,791
If you want to.
Right now?

419
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,167
Sure, right now.

420
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:48,100
[Walter sighing]

421
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:51,645
I'm crazy about you, baby.
I'm crazy about you, Walter.

422
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:54,481
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

423
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:57,484
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

424
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,779
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

425
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:03,740
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.

426
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:06,785
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

427
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:15,669
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

428
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:25,262
Club soda?
Plain water, please.

429
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,141
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

430
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:32,519
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

431
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:34,980
Only he had
accident insurance.

432
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:37,565
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

433
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:39,734
Who didn't?
His wife.

434
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:44,322
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

435
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:47,617
His wife said he was cleaning a
gun and his stomach got in the way.

436
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:51,287
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

437
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:54,165
Perhaps it was
worth it to her.

438
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:59,003
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

439
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:05,969
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

440
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:08,638
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

441
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,808
Cook your own breakfast? Squeeze
a grapefruit once in a while.

442
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:14,811
Get the rest down at the corner
drugstore. Sounds wonderful.

443
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:16,604
Just strangers beside you.

444
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:19,357
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

445
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:21,067
You don't have to
sit across the table...

446
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,362
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

447
00:26:24,404 --> 00:26:27,698
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

448
00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:29,784
Lola. She lives with us.

449
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:32,370
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

450
00:26:32,787 --> 00:26:35,206
You ever think of a divorce?
He wouldn't give me a divorce.

451
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:36,707
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

452
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:39,335
He hasn't got any money. Not since
he went into the oil business.

453
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:41,170
But he had
when you married him?

454
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:45,758
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

455
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:50,221
But that's not the only
reason. I was his wife's nurse.

456
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:53,891
She was sick a long time. When she
died, he was terribly broken up.

457
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:57,436
I pitied him so.
And now you hate him.

458
00:26:57,645 --> 00:27:00,398
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

459
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:03,442
Every time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off.

460
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:05,236
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

461
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,029
He's always been mean to me.

462
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:10,991
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

463
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:14,203
That Lola.
Nothing for you at all?

464
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:16,705
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

465
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:21,168
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas.

466
00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:24,213
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

467
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:27,633
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

468
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:33,514
Only sometimes you wish
he was dead. Perhaps I do.

469
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:37,351
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

470
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,937
Is that it?
Perhaps that, too.

471
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:45,192
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

472
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:49,112
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

473
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,906
and the motor still running.

474
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:54,993
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

475
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:58,413
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

476
00:27:58,497 --> 00:27:59,665
I'll tell you what
it'd be like.

477
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:02,334
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

478
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,503
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

479
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,547
For him a setup like that'd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef.

480
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:09,466
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

481
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,635
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

482
00:28:11,718 --> 00:28:13,845
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

483
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:15,764
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

484
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:18,100
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

485
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:20,268
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

486
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,854
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

487
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:25,982
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

488
00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:28,360
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

489
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:33,323
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

490
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:38,536
<i>(Walter)
So we just sat there.</i>

491
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:42,999
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain
on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

492
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:46,044
<i>Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.</i>

493
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:47,379
I couldn't.

494
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,882
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

495
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:53,676
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

496
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:56,596
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

497
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,306
In this business
you can't sleep...

498
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:01,226
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

499
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:02,727
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

500
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:06,105
watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

501
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:09,859
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

502
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,444
And do it smart.

503
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:13,613
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

504
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:15,823
You know every notch in it
by heart.

505
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:18,576
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

506
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,745
A shill to put down the bet.

507
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:22,872
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

508
00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:25,416
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

509
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:32,340
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

510
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,761
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

511
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:42,058
The stakes were $50,000, but
they were the life of a man, too.

512
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:45,436
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

513
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:48,731
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

514
00:29:50,316 --> 00:29:51,525
<i>And I did.</i>

515
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:06,665
Will you phone me? Walter?

516
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:12,379
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

517
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:15,382
You believe me, don't you,
Walter? Sure I believe you.

518
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:21,347
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

519
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,766
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

520
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,392
It's better than
going on this way.

521
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:26,602
They're not gonna
hang you because...

522
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:28,479
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

523
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:31,231
Do you know what you're saying?
Sure, I know what I'm saying.

524
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:32,816
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

525
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,028
And I'm the guy that knows
how. Walter, you're hurting me.

526
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:39,073
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

527
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:40,616
It's got to be perfect.

528
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:55,964
Call me tomorrow. But not
from your house. From a booth.

529
00:30:56,048 --> 00:30:57,925
And watch your step
every single minute.

530
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:01,094
This has got to be perfect, you
understand? Straight down the line.

531
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:04,348
Straight down the line.

532
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,460
[Rain pattering]

533
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:38,048
[Car engine starts]

534
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,093
[Car driving away]

535
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,600
<i>(Walter)
That was it, Keyes.</i>

536
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:51,686
<i>The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.</i>

537
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:55,857
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

538
00:31:56,316 --> 00:32:00,070
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

539
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:03,615
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

540
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:08,703
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

541
00:32:09,454 --> 00:32:11,206
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

542
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,416
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

543
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:17,962
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

544
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:20,506
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

545
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,345
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

546
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:27,930
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

547
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,476
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

548
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,604
to have her sitting right there in
the room, playing Chinese checkers...

549
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:37,273
<i>as if nothing
were going to happen.</i>

550
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:40,860
(Walter) I suppose you
realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

551
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:42,236
that, not being an employee...

552
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,614
you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.

553
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:47,950
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

554
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,202
Yeah, I know
all about that.

555
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:50,745
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

556
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:54,332
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

557
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:56,125
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

558
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,002
we'd stay broke paying
for it, wouldn't we, honey?

559
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:01,964
What keeps us broke is you going
out and buying five hats at a crack.

560
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:03,716
Who needs a hat in California?

561
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,468
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

562
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,970
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

563
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:10,931
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

564
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:12,099
Just as you say.

565
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:14,977
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

566
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,270
Sure.

567
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:19,899
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

568
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:21,859
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

569
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:24,320
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?

570
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:25,613
Yes, I have.

571
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:28,741
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

572
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:31,952
Run along where? Who with? Just
Anne. We're going roller-skating.

573
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:33,787
Anne who?
Anne Matthews.

574
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:35,831
It's not that Nino
Zachetti again, is it?

575
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:37,291
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

576
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,584
If I ever catch you
with that...

577
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,002
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

578
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,171
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

579
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:45,340
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

580
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,885
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

581
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:50,512
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

582
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,973
Good night, Phyllis. Good
night, Miss Dietrichson.

583
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:55,017
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

584
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,768
Good night, Mr. Neff.

585
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,773
A great little fighter
for her weight.

586
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:05,277
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

587
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,738
Sign what? The applications
for the auto renewals.

588
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,781
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

589
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:11,533
When will that be?
About a week.

590
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:13,535
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

591
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,454
San Francisco?
Palo Alto.

592
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:17,247
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

593
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:19,750
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

594
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:23,378
What's wrong with that? Can't I
have a little fun, even once a year?

595
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,130
Great football school,
Stanford.

596
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:27,174
Did you play football, Mr.
Dietrichson? Left guard.

597
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:28,884
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

598
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,302
The bottom line.

599
00:34:34,931 --> 00:34:36,975
Both copies, please.
Sign twice, huh?

600
00:34:37,017 --> 00:34:38,351
Yes. One is
the agent's copy.

601
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:42,355
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

602
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:49,571
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

603
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,490
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

604
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:54,784
How much you taking me for?
$147.50.

605
00:34:54,868 --> 00:34:57,537
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

606
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,830
Plenty.

607
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:05,378
Bring me some soda when you come
up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.

608
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:06,463
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

609
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:09,174
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

610
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,482
Good night, Mr. Neff.

611
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,320
All right, Walter?
Fine.

612
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,322
He signed it, didn't he? Sure
he signed it. You saw him.

613
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,324
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?

614
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,366
End of the month.

615
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,451
He drives, huh?
He always drives.

616
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,161
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

617
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,787
Why? Because it's all
worked out for a train.

618
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,206
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

619
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,167
a little thing called
double indemnity.

620
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,128
The insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers.

621
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,338
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

622
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:51,048
The kind that almost
never happen.

623
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:53,634
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

624
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,137
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

625
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,639
I see. We're hitting
it for the limit, baby.

626
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,225
That's why
it's got to be the train.

627
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,354
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

628
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:07,356
Straight down the line.

629
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:28,335
(Lola)
Hello, Mr. Neff.

630
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:30,963
It's me.

631
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:34,049
Is anything wrong?
I've been waiting for you.

632
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:35,217
For me? Why?

633
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:38,596
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

634
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:47,187
Which way would that be?
Down the hill. Down Vermont.

635
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,274
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

636
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:51,692
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

637
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,073
Going roller-skating, huh?

638
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,577
You like roller-skating?
I can take it or leave it.

639
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:05,664
Only tonight you're
leaving it? Yes, I am.

640
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:09,710
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

641
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:13,130
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

642
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:17,092
Sounds tough, all right. That's
why I have to lie sometimes.

643
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,552
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

644
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:20,554
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

645
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:23,765
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

646
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,893
You won't tell on me,
will you?

647
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:29,688
I'd have to think it over. Nino's
not what my father says at all.

648
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:32,858
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

649
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,902
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

650
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,655
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

651
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,742
Then he lost his job for
talking back. He's so hot-headed.

652
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:45,245
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

653
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,831
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

654
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:50,125
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

655
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,962
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

656
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,549
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

657
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,803
I suppose it will sometime. This
is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

658
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:07,016
(Lola)
Nino? Over here, Nino.

659
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:18,236
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
Hello, Nino.

660
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:19,946
The name is Zachetti.

661
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:22,699
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

662
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,867
I told him all about us.

663
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:25,285
Why does he have to
get told about us?

664
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:27,370
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

665
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:28,997
I'm not doing any worrying.

666
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,373
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

667
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:32,166
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

668
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,711
Why, he's a friend.
I don't have any friends.

669
00:38:34,794 --> 00:38:37,046
If I did, I like to pick
them myself. Come on.

670
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,465
Look, sonny, she needed a
ride, so I brought her along.

671
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:41,718
Is that anything
to get tough about?

672
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:44,262
All right, Lola, make up your
mind. Are you coming or aren't you?

673
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:46,097
Of course I'm coming.

674
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:51,936
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

675
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:54,355
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

Walter, I wanted to...
Not so loud.

I wanted to talk to you,

It's all set.

The accident policy came
through. I've got it in my pocket.

699
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:12,933
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

700
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:15,143
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

701
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:18,105
The check's just made out to the
company, so it could be for anything.

702
00:40:18,146 --> 00:40:20,941
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

703
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:24,069
Itll be all right that way, because
one of the cars is in your name.

704

Yes. We both have keys.
Fine.

But don't put the policy in
there yet. I'll tell you when.

Remember, you never saw it, you
never even touched it, you understand?

710
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:42,421
I'm not a fool. Okay. When
is he leaving on the train?

711
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:43,964
That's just it. He isn't going. What?

it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

738
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:56,953
I better go, baby. I'm
thinking of you every minute.

739
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,546
<i>(Walter) After that, a full week
went by and I didn't see her once.</i>

740
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:10,091
<i>I tried to keep my mind off
her and off the whole idea.</i>

741
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:13,094
<i>I kept telling myself that maybe
those Fates they say watch over you...</i>

742
00:42:13,177 --> 00:42:16,889
<i>had gotten together and broken
his leg to give me a way out.</i>

743
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:20,935
<i>Then it was the 15th of June.
You may remember that date, Keyes.</i>

744
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:25,690
<i>You came into my office
around 3:00 in the afternoon.</i>

745
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,650
Hello, Keyes.

746
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:28,943
I just came
from Norton's office.

747
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:30,528
The semiannual sales
records are out.

748
00:42:30,611 --> 00:42:33,489
You're high man, Walter. That's
twice in a row. Congratulations.

749
00:42:33,572 --> 00:42:36,283
Thanks. How would you
like a cheap drink?

750
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:38,828
How would you like
a $50 cut in salary?

751
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:41,163
Do I laugh now or wait till
it gets funny? No, I'm serious.

752
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:44,542
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

753
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:45,960
Too much pressure
on my nerves.

754
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:48,045
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

755
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:50,005
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

756
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,507
Me? Why pick on me?

757
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:54,093
Well, because I've got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job.

758
00:42:54,176 --> 00:42:55,552
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

759
00:42:55,636 --> 00:42:58,806
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

760
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,641
You're too good
to be a salesman.

761
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:02,851
Nobody's too good to
be a salesman. Phooey!

762
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:06,438
All you guys do is just ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

763
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:08,649
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

764
00:43:08,732 --> 00:43:10,275
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.

765
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:13,320
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

766
00:43:13,362 --> 00:43:15,280
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

767
00:43:15,364 --> 00:43:16,490
It's the hottest job
in the business.

768
00:43:16,532 --> 00:43:17,783
Yeah, but it's still
a desk job.

769
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:19,952
I don't want to be nailed
to a desk. Desk job?

770
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:21,620
Is that all you can see in it?

771
00:43:21,703 --> 00:43:24,665
Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

772
00:43:24,748 --> 00:43:27,501
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around, and five sharp pencils...

773
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:31,922
and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

774
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:34,007
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

775
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:38,178
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

776
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:41,098
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

777
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:44,976
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

778
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:48,146
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

779
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:50,565
with twisted hopes
and crooked dreams.

780
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:53,860
A claims man, Walter, is a
doctor and a bloodhound and a...

781
00:43:53,944 --> 00:43:55,403
[telephone ringing]

782
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:58,490
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

783
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,868
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury...

784
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:03,662
and a father confessor,
all in one.

785
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:05,288
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

786
00:44:05,372 --> 00:44:06,498
You don't want to work
with your brains?

787
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:08,625
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

788
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:12,253
for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

789
00:44:12,337 --> 00:44:14,839
Walter Neff speaking.
I had to call you, Walter.

790
00:44:14,923 --> 00:44:16,299
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?

791
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:20,929
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

792
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:24,849
No, you can't. I've only
got a minute. It can't wait.

793
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:28,186
Listen. He's going tonight. On
the train. Are you listening?

794
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:30,855
Walter?
Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

795
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:34,108
Only, make it snappy,
will you? He's on crutches.

796
00:44:34,192 --> 00:44:37,529
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

797
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,323
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

798
00:44:40,406 --> 00:44:42,992
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

799
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:45,495
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

800
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,373
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

801
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:51,167
Keyes, suppose I join you in your
office? That's all right. I'll wait.

802
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,711
Only tell her
not to take all day.

803
00:44:55,463 --> 00:44:56,589
Go ahead.

804
00:44:56,923 --> 00:45:00,009
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

805
00:45:00,051 --> 00:45:01,886
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

806
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:05,223
And the signal is three honks
on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

807
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:07,016
No.

808
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:08,309
Oh, uh...

809
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:10,478
what color did you pick?

810
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:13,439
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

811
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,358
Mmm-hmm.

812
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,443
Yeah, that suits me fine.

813
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:19,779
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

814
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:22,865
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

815
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:25,076
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

816
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:29,038
Sorry, Keyes.
What's the matter?

817
00:45:29,121 --> 00:45:31,874
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

818
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:33,793
If I told you
it was a customer...

819
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:36,003
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

820
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:37,963
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

821
00:45:38,047 --> 00:45:42,092
Why don't you, for instance? I
almost did, once. Long time ago.

822
00:45:42,176 --> 00:45:43,928
Now look, Keyes, I've
got to call on a prospect.

823
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:46,514
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

824
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:48,849
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

825
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:51,727
I was on my way to the
jewelry store to buy the ring.

826
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,396
And then suddenly that little
man in here started working on me.

827
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,023
So you went back
and had her investigated?

828
00:45:56,065 --> 00:45:58,525
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

829
00:45:59,485 --> 00:46:01,862
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

830
00:46:01,904 --> 00:46:04,448
There was a manic depressive in
her family, on her mother's side.

831
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:06,158
She already had one husband.

832
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:08,327
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

833
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,454
And as for her brother...
I get the general idea.

834
00:46:10,537 --> 00:46:14,166
She was a tramp from a long line of
tramps. Yeah. All right, all right.

835
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:16,960
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for?

836
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:18,587
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.

837
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,173
Thanks just the same.
Fair enough.

838
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,343
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

839
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:26,553
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

840
00:46:26,637 --> 00:46:29,973
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

841
00:46:37,147 --> 00:46:40,150
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

842
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,527
You're just a little taller.

843
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:54,790
<i>(Walter)
Yes, Keyes.</i>

844
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:58,460
<i>Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.</i>

845
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:01,922
<i>Now they had thrown the
switch. The gears had meshed.</i>

846
00:47:02,005 --> 00:47:04,633
<i>The time for thinking
had all run out.</i>

847
00:47:05,383 --> 00:47:09,095
<i>I wanted my movements accounted
for up to the last possible moment.</i>

848
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:13,308
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate
book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

849
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:15,393
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

850
00:47:16,853 --> 00:47:19,564
<i>From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...</i>

851
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:20,690
<i>move by move.</i>

852
00:47:22,525 --> 00:47:25,612
<i>I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.</i>

853
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,615
<i>This was another item
to establish my alibi.</i>

854
00:47:29,991 --> 00:47:32,285
Hi, Mr. Neff.
Hello, Charlie.

855
00:47:32,368 --> 00:47:34,204
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

856
00:47:34,245 --> 00:47:35,413
How soon you gonna want it?

857
00:47:35,497 --> 00:47:36,915
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

858
00:47:36,956 --> 00:47:38,500
Any time you get
to it, Charlie.

859
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:40,793
I'm staying in tonight.
Okay.

860
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:42,879
<i>(Walter) Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

861
00:47:42,921 --> 00:47:45,256
<i>one of the salesmen
that shared my office.</i>

862
00:47:45,298 --> 00:47:48,718
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll
call and there'd be a record of it.</i>

863
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,095
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my
rate book and needed some dope...</i>

864
00:47:51,137 --> 00:47:54,098
<i>on the public liability bond
I was figuring.</i>

865
00:47:54,223 --> 00:47:57,977
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

866
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:01,147
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

867
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,649
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

868
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:07,695
<i>so I could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

869
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:09,822
<i>Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...</i>

870
00:48:09,906 --> 00:48:12,742
<i>so that it would fall down
if the bell rang.</i>

871
00:48:12,783 --> 00:48:16,287
<i>That way I'd know if anybody
had called me while I was away.</i>

872
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:20,583
<i>Then I did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me.</i>

873
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:24,712
<i>I left the apartment by the
service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

874
00:48:25,713 --> 00:48:28,966
<i>I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.</i>

875
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,426
<i>I didn't want
to take the bus...</i>

876
00:48:30,468 --> 00:48:34,138
<i>because there was always the chance that
someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

877
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:36,223
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

878
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:39,226
<i>I could smell that
honeysuckle again.</i>

879
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,480
<i>Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.</i>

880
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:50,070

Yeah, I'm all right.

891

passengers told how he went through...

crutches and fell off the train.

I just talked to this Jackson long
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

1024

Who's Jackson?

1025
01:01:33,118 --> 01:01:34,620
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

1026
01:01:34,703 --> 01:01:37,289
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

1027
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:39,416
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

1028
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,126
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

1029
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,587
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

1030
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,506
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

1031
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:47,549
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

1032
01:01:47,633 --> 01:01:50,344
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

1033
01:01:50,427 --> 01:01:52,930
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

1034
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,973
Anything else?
No, not much.

1035
01:01:55,057 --> 01:01:58,060
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1036
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:01,521
There's a daughter, but all she
remembers is Neff talking to her father...

1037
01:02:01,563 --> 01:02:03,815
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1038
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:05,233
I couldn't sell him at first.

1039
01:02:05,317 --> 01:02:08,236
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1040
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,490
Later I saw him in the
oil fields and closed him.

1041
01:02:11,573 --> 01:02:13,617
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1042
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,078
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1043
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:17,788
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1044
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:19,831
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

1045
01:02:19,873 --> 01:02:23,168
Are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train?

1046
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:27,005
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1047
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,674
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1048
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:31,259
Then what do you
think of this case?

1049
01:02:31,343 --> 01:02:33,094
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1050
01:02:33,178 --> 01:02:35,305
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1051
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:37,140
Just what is your opinion?

1052
01:02:37,182 --> 01:02:38,934
No opinion at all.
Not even a hunch?

1053
01:02:39,017 --> 01:02:41,353
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1054
01:02:41,436 --> 01:02:42,771
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1055
01:02:42,854 --> 01:02:46,524
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

1056
01:02:46,608 --> 01:02:50,278
I think I know. In fact, I know I
know what happened to Dietrichson.

1057
01:02:50,362 --> 01:02:53,698
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.

1058
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:59,662
What do you say to that?
Me?

1059
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,416
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1060
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,045
There's a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office...

1061
01:03:07,128 --> 01:03:08,296
[intercom buzzing]

1062
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:12,842
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1063
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:14,928
There's a widespread
feeling that...

1064
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:18,306
just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

1065
01:03:18,389 --> 01:03:20,308
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1066
01:03:20,391 --> 01:03:23,353
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1067
01:03:23,394 --> 01:03:25,021
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1068
01:03:29,233 --> 01:03:31,652
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1069
01:03:31,694 --> 01:03:34,489
I assure you I appreciate
it. This is Mr. Keyes.

1070
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:36,032
How do you do?
How do you do?

1071
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:38,117
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1072
01:03:38,201 --> 01:03:40,745
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?

1073
01:03:43,372 --> 01:03:45,208
(Norton) May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

1074
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:47,793
I hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss.

1075
01:03:47,877 --> 01:03:51,505
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1076
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:53,174
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1077
01:03:53,215 --> 01:03:55,843
No. All I know is that your
secretary made it sound very urgent.

1078
01:03:55,885 --> 01:03:58,012
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

1079
01:03:58,095 --> 01:03:59,805
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1080
01:03:59,889 --> 01:04:02,600
No. I remember some talk at the
house, but he didn't seem to want it.

1081
01:04:02,683 --> 01:04:05,978
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1082
01:04:06,062 --> 01:04:08,522
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1083
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:10,357
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1084
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:12,443
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

1085
01:04:12,526 --> 01:04:14,195
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1086
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:15,738
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

1087
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,406
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1088
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,491
What sort of things?

1089
01:04:18,908 --> 01:04:21,076
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

1090
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,205
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1091
01:04:24,288 --> 01:04:26,874
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1092
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:31,462
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1093
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:34,048
a suicide.

1094
01:04:37,426 --> 01:04:40,804
I'm sorry. Would you like
a glass of water? Please.

1095
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:46,894
Thank you.

1096
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:56,445
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1097
01:04:56,528 --> 01:04:59,281
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1098
01:04:59,364 --> 01:05:02,701
He was perfectly all right and I
don't know of any financial worries.

1099
01:05:02,743 --> 01:05:04,870
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

1100
01:05:04,953 --> 01:05:09,082
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1101
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:12,169
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1102
01:05:12,252 --> 01:05:14,880
Do what? Next, he goes on
this trip entirely alone.

1103
01:05:14,963 --> 01:05:18,550
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1104
01:05:18,633 --> 01:05:22,304
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1105
01:05:22,554 --> 01:05:25,640
Once there, he finds he is not
alone. There is a man there.

1106
01:05:25,724 --> 01:05:29,436
What was his name, Keyes? His name
was Jackson. Probably still is.

1107
01:05:29,936 --> 01:05:33,648
So he gets rid of this Jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1108
01:05:33,732 --> 01:05:37,027
And then he is alone. And
then he does it. Does what?

1109
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:40,780
He jumps. Suicide. In which
case, the company is not liable.

1110
01:05:41,156 --> 01:05:44,034
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1111
01:05:44,075 --> 01:05:47,912
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1112
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,416
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1113
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:54,377
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1114
01:05:54,419 --> 01:05:56,921
A settlement for a certain
sum, a part of the policy value.

1115
01:05:56,963 --> 01:06:00,675
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1116
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:02,761
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1117
01:06:02,844 --> 01:06:05,263
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

1118
01:06:05,346 --> 01:06:07,682
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1119
01:06:07,765 --> 01:06:11,102
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1120
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:14,898
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1121
01:06:18,026 --> 01:06:19,068
[Door slamming]

1122
01:06:19,736 --> 01:06:22,989
(Keyes) Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1123
01:06:23,072 --> 01:06:24,407
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

1124
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:27,702
Then you heaved an illegal forward
pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1125
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:30,705
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1126
01:06:30,788 --> 01:06:33,791
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1127
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:35,376
Oh, can we?

1128
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:39,255
Mr. Norton, the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle.

1129
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:43,092
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1130
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:46,721
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1131
01:06:46,762 --> 01:06:49,265
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1132
01:06:49,307 --> 01:06:51,434
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1133
01:06:51,517 --> 01:06:53,269
Yeah, in the front office.

1134
01:06:53,352 --> 01:06:56,522
Come now, you've never read an
actuarial table in your life, have you?

1135
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:58,858
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1136
01:06:58,941 --> 01:07:00,735
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1137
01:07:00,776 --> 01:07:02,778
by sex, by seasons of
the year, by time of day.

1138
01:07:02,862 --> 01:07:06,240
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1139
01:07:06,282 --> 01:07:08,951
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

1140
01:07:09,035 --> 01:07:11,662
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1141
01:07:11,746 --> 01:07:13,205
alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

1142
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:15,958
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

1143
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:18,169
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1144
01:07:18,252 --> 01:07:21,505
under the feet of horses, from
steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1145
01:07:21,755 --> 01:07:25,259
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1146
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:26,719
from the rear end
of a moving train.

1147
01:07:26,802 --> 01:07:28,554
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1148
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:31,599
at the point where the body
was found? 15 miles an hour.

1149
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,809
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1150
01:07:33,893 --> 01:07:36,770
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1151
01:07:36,812 --> 01:07:38,522
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1152
01:07:38,606 --> 01:07:41,692
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1153
01:07:41,775 --> 01:07:43,360
May I have this?

1154
01:07:46,697 --> 01:07:48,282
Come on, Walter.

1155
01:07:51,452 --> 01:07:53,620
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1156
01:08:10,095 --> 01:08:12,514
<i>(Walter) I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1157
01:08:12,598 --> 01:08:14,141
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1158

<i>You were the only one
we were really scared of...</i>

1159

<i>and instead you were
almost playing on our team.</i>

1160
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,983
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1161
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:25,068
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

1162
01:08:25,152 --> 01:08:27,946
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1163
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:30,282
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1164

already deposited in the bank.</i>

1166
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:43,837
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1167
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,256
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

1168
01:08:46,298 --> 01:08:49,551
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1169

How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

Okay. But be careful.

Hello, Keyes.

1175
01:09:32,427 --> 01:09:35,054
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.

1176
01:09:35,596 --> 01:09:38,683
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?

1177
01:09:38,766 --> 01:09:42,270
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1178
01:09:42,562 --> 01:09:44,605
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1179
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:46,649
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.

1180
01:09:46,691 --> 01:09:50,486
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?

1181

Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1182

That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1183
01:09:57,285 --> 01:09:59,620
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1184
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:03,499
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1185
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:06,586
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

1186
01:10:08,754 --> 01:10:10,256
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1187
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,508
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1188
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:13,634
Yeah.
You got his check?

1189
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:14,844
Sure I did.

No, I haven't.

Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1192
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:26,147
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1193
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:28,649
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1194
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:30,317
No. Not suicide.

1195
01:10:30,943 --> 01:10:33,988
But not an accident, either.
What else?

1196

Now look, Walter.

if he's killed on a train.

1199
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,912
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1200
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:45,958
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

One out of I don't know
how many billions.

And add to that the broken leg. No,
it just can't be the way it looks.

Yeah.

didn't know anything about anything.

You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

was worked, or who worked it...

but all I know is that
it was worked.

so fast it'd make her head spin.

they would squeeze out.

one of those things?

But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

1262
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:32,015
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

When your mother died?

1264
01:14:33,183 --> 01:14:35,560
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1265
01:14:35,644 --> 01:14:36,645
We had a cabin there.

1266
01:14:36,728 --> 01:14:41,066
It was winter and very cold. My
mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1267
01:14:41,358 --> 01:14:43,068
She had a nurse with her.

1268
01:14:43,193 --> 01:14:46,196
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

1269
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:48,990
One night I got up and
went into my mother's room.

1270
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:50,909
She was delirious with fever.

1271
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:54,704
All the bed covers were on the
floor and the windows were wide open.

1272
01:14:54,788 --> 01:14:55,956
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1273
01:14:56,039 --> 01:14:58,208
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1274
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:01,044
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

1275
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:03,546
The nurse stood there.

1276
01:15:04,089 --> 01:15:07,717
She didn't say a word, but
there was a look in her eyes...

1277
01:15:07,884 --> 01:15:09,552
I'll never forget.

1278
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:14,724
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1279
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:20,355
Do you know who
that nurse was?

1280
01:15:20,563 --> 01:15:22,232
No. Who?
Phyllis.

1281
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,068
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1282
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:28,279
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

1283
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:32,784
and I kind of talked myself out of the
idea she could have done anything like that.

1284
01:15:32,825 --> 01:15:37,288
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1285
01:15:37,372 --> 01:15:41,209
You're not making sense, Miss
Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.

1286
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:44,295
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1287
01:15:44,379 --> 01:15:46,881
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1288
01:15:46,923 --> 01:15:48,257
pinning a black veil to it.

1289
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:51,761
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1290
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:53,888
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1291
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:55,556
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

1292
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,100
I caught her eyes
in the mirror.

1293
01:15:57,183 --> 01:16:00,228
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1294
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:01,771
That same look.

1295
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,232
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

1296
01:16:04,315 --> 01:16:06,150
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1297
01:16:06,234 --> 01:16:08,653
I loathe her because she did
it. She did it for the money.

1298
01:16:08,736 --> 01:16:11,072
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1299
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:14,242
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

1300
01:16:14,325 --> 01:16:15,826
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

1301
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:20,247
You'd better be careful, saying things
like... I'm not afraid. You'll see.

Of course not.

<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.</i>

1318
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:17,387
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1319
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:21,266
<i>The next day was Sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach.</i>

1320
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:24,061
<i>She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.</i>

1321
01:17:24,144 --> 01:17:27,689
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

1322
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:30,692
<i>It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.</i>

1323
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:32,736
<i>And I had no chance
to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1324
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:34,988
<i>You were watching her
like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1325
01:17:35,072 --> 01:17:39,409
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I
was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

1326
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:43,580
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

1327
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:46,625
<i>For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.</i>

1328
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,168
<i>It was worse.</i>

1329
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:52,714
<i>Outside your door was the last
guy in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1330
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:03,850
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1331
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:08,271
Hello, Keyes.
I want to ask you something.

1332
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:10,565
After all the years
we've known each other...

1333
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:12,567
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1334
01:18:12,651 --> 01:18:14,235
About what?
About me.

1335
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:17,489
Walter, I'm a very great man.
Yeah?

1336
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:20,325
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1337
01:18:20,408 --> 01:18:22,410
and murders don't come
any neater.

1338
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:25,330
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1339
01:18:25,413 --> 01:18:27,665
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1340
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:31,044
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

1341
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:34,964
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

1342
01:18:35,006 --> 01:18:37,759
Go ahead. I'm listening.
You know what?

1343
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:41,054
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1344
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:44,265
He wasn't?
No, he wasn't.

1345
01:18:45,808 --> 01:18:48,144
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

1346
01:18:48,186 --> 01:18:51,314
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1347
01:18:51,397 --> 01:18:53,858
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1348
01:18:53,941 --> 01:18:55,860
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

1349
01:18:55,943 --> 01:18:58,112
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

1350
01:18:58,196 --> 01:19:01,949
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1351
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:03,201
and put him on the tracks.

1352
01:19:03,284 --> 01:19:06,537
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

1353
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,290
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

1354
01:19:09,415 --> 01:19:11,167
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1355
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:15,129
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1356
01:19:15,379 --> 01:19:18,799
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1357
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:20,635
then the somebody
else jumped off...

1358
01:19:20,676 --> 01:19:23,262
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

1359
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:25,973
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1360
01:19:26,807 --> 01:19:28,934
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1361
01:19:29,018 --> 01:19:30,519
they have the crutches
to stare at...

1362
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:33,064
they never really looked
at the man at all.

1363
01:19:33,147 --> 01:19:35,316
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

1364
01:19:35,358 --> 01:19:38,736
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1365
01:19:39,403 --> 01:19:41,322
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1366
01:19:41,363 --> 01:19:44,283
The only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed Dietrichson...

1367
01:19:44,325 --> 01:19:46,452
is sitting
right outside my office.

1368
01:19:46,535 --> 01:19:49,997
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1369
01:19:51,707 --> 01:19:54,543
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1370
01:19:54,668 --> 01:19:56,295
These are fine cigars
you smoke.

1371
01:19:56,378 --> 01:19:58,130
Two for a quarter.
That's what I said.

1372
01:19:58,172 --> 01:19:59,757
Well, did you study
those photographs?

1373
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,842
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1374
01:20:01,926 --> 01:20:03,761
Very thoroughly.
Have you made up your mind?

1375
01:20:03,844 --> 01:20:05,804
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford
man. Medford, Oregon.

1376
01:20:05,888 --> 01:20:08,057
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1377
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:11,143
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1378
01:20:11,226 --> 01:20:13,479
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1379
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,521
Yes.

1380
01:20:15,064 --> 01:20:17,274
Then my answer is no.
What do you mean, no?

1381
01:20:17,357 --> 01:20:19,526
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1382
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:20,819
Will you swear to that?

1383
01:20:20,861 --> 01:20:22,863
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1384
01:20:22,946 --> 01:20:25,324
If I say it, I mean it. If I
mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1385
01:20:25,365 --> 01:20:26,992
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1386
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:28,744
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1387
01:20:28,827 --> 01:20:30,787
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

1388
01:20:30,871 --> 01:20:32,247
How are you?
Very fine, thank you.

1389
01:20:32,331 --> 01:20:34,666
Never was better.
Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1390
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:38,128
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1391
01:20:38,211 --> 01:20:40,922
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1392
01:20:41,048 --> 01:20:44,009
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1393
01:20:44,051 --> 01:20:46,094
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1394
01:20:46,178 --> 01:20:48,555
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1395
01:20:48,638 --> 01:20:51,516
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1396
01:20:51,725 --> 01:20:54,227
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1397
01:20:54,311 --> 01:20:56,563
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

1398
01:20:56,646 --> 01:20:59,274
But I'm positive just the
same. Thank you, Jackson.

1399
01:20:59,357 --> 01:21:01,776
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

1400
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,946
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1401
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:07,782
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1402
01:21:07,866 --> 01:21:11,161
Expenses paid, of course.
Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1403
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,332
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1404
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:18,084
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1405
01:21:18,168 --> 01:21:22,255
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1406
01:21:22,339 --> 01:21:25,133
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1407
01:21:25,216 --> 01:21:26,968
the Dietrichson claim.

1408
01:21:28,053 --> 01:21:30,180
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

1409
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:31,347
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1410
01:21:31,389 --> 01:21:32,432
(Keyes)
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1411
01:21:32,515 --> 01:21:34,017
No. Never been up there.

1412
01:21:34,225 --> 01:21:36,853
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1413
01:21:36,895 --> 01:21:40,565
Maybe I saw you up Klamath
Falls way. Nope. I don't fish.

1414
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:44,194
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1415
01:21:44,736 --> 01:21:47,322
There's a family of Neffs
in Corvallis. No relation.

1416
01:21:47,363 --> 01:21:49,782
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1417
01:21:49,866 --> 01:21:52,201
A very reputable man, too, I'm
told. All right, Mr. Jackson.

1418
01:21:52,243 --> 01:21:53,786
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1419
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,330
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1420
01:21:55,371 --> 01:21:58,708
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1421
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,751
Tonight?

1422
01:21:59,876 --> 01:22:03,087
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1423
01:22:03,171 --> 01:22:05,965
I'd like to see before
I leave. Osteopath?

1424
01:22:06,507 --> 01:22:09,552
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1425
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:12,013
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1426
01:22:12,054 --> 01:22:14,390
It's been a pleasure.
Goodbye.

1427
01:22:16,684 --> 01:22:20,605
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1428
01:22:20,688 --> 01:22:23,399
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

1429
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:25,943
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

1430
01:22:26,027 --> 01:22:28,904
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1431
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:30,990
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1432
01:22:31,073 --> 01:22:33,951
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,
somewhere, they've got to meet.

1433
01:22:34,035 --> 01:22:35,328
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

1434
01:22:35,411 --> 01:22:38,831
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1435
01:22:38,914 --> 01:22:41,375
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1436
01:22:41,417 --> 01:22:42,835
But it isn't twice as safe.

1437
01:22:42,877 --> 01:22:46,046
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1438
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:48,257
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1439
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,092
where they can get off
at different stops.

1440
01:22:50,176 --> 01:22:52,428
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1441
01:22:52,511 --> 01:22:53,971
all the way to
the end of the line.

1442
01:22:54,054 --> 01:22:56,390
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

1443
01:22:56,432 --> 01:22:58,225
She put in her claim.

1444
01:22:58,893 --> 01:23:01,478
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

1445
01:23:07,067 --> 01:23:08,819
Let her sue us if she dares.

1446
01:23:08,902 --> 01:23:11,697
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

1447
01:23:11,739 --> 01:23:14,283
They'll be digging
their own graves.

1448
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,377
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1449
01:23:25,461 --> 01:23:28,464
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1450
01:23:28,547 --> 01:23:32,092
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1451
01:23:59,161 --> 01:24:01,788
Hello, Walter.
Come over here.

1452
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,420
What's the matter?
Everything's the matter.

1453
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:11,798
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1454
01:24:11,882 --> 01:24:14,467
He's sitting back with his mouth
watering, waiting for you to sue.

1455
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:16,344
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1456
01:24:16,428 --> 01:24:19,306
What's he got to stop me?
He's got plenty.

1457
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:23,560
He's figured out how
it was worked.

1458
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:25,395
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1459
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:27,314
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1460
01:24:27,397 --> 01:24:29,733
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1461
01:24:29,816 --> 01:24:33,319
Yeah? And then you're in court and a
lot of other things are going to come up.

1462
01:24:33,403 --> 01:24:37,240
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1463
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:39,242
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1464
01:24:39,284 --> 01:24:40,326
The way she died.

1465
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:43,413
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1466
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,248
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1467
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:47,667
She's been seeing you. I've been
seeing her, if you want to know.

1468
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,419
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1469
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:52,255
She's putting on an act for you, crying
all over your shoulder, the lying...

1470
01:24:52,297 --> 01:24:54,632
Keep her out of this. All I'm
telling you is we're not going to sue.

1471
01:24:54,716 --> 01:24:55,883
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1472
01:24:55,967 --> 01:24:57,176
even if you could have it,
because she's...

1473
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,428
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

1474
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:01,764
It isn't the money anymore. It's our
necks. We're pulling out, do you understand?

1475
01:25:01,848 --> 01:25:04,767
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1476
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:07,103
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1477
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:10,064
You're afraid she might find out
someday and you can't take it, can you?

1478
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:12,066
I said, leave her out of this.

1479
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,281
It's me I'm talking about.

1480
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:20,533
I don't want to be left
out of it. Stop saying that.

1481
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:21,993
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

1482
01:25:22,076 --> 01:25:24,704
We can't go through with it, that's
all. We have gone through with it.

1483
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:25,872
The tough part
is all behind us.

1484
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:28,457
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1485
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,252
stick close together
the way we started out.

1486
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:32,587
Watch it.

1487
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,940
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1488
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:56,527
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1489
01:25:56,610 --> 01:26:00,239
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1490
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:03,450
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1491
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:07,246
Is that what you're telling
me? And nobody's pulling out.

1492
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:09,957
We went into this together, we're
coming out at the end together.

1493
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,752
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1494
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,136
<i>(Walter)
Yes, I remembered.</i>

1495
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,765
<i>Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1496
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:29,309
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1497
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:31,770
<i>and how there was no getting
off till the end of the line...</i>

1498
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:35,315
...where the cemetery was.

1499
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:40,028
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1500
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,948
They're to put dead people in.

1501
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:48,328
I guess that was the first time I
ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1502
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:49,913
Dead, I mean.

1503
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,709
And how it would be
if she were dead.

1504

but it was only with her that...</i>

1507
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,848
<i>I could relax
and let go a little.</i>

1508
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:39,754
Why are you crying?

1509
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,883
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1510
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:47,971
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1511
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:52,100
It's about Nino.
Zachetti? What about him?

1512
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:55,144
They killed my father
together. He and Phyllis.

1513
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:57,689
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1514
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:00,483
What makes you say that?

1515
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:04,153
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1516
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:06,656
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

1517
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:10,952
Maybe he was just going with me as a
blind. And the night of the murder...

1518
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:13,121
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1519
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:16,749
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1520
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,710
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1521
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:21,629

1524
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,978

Maybe it's all in my mind.

Oh, nothing much.

Hello, baby.

1604
01:35:03,444 --> 01:35:06,155
Anybody else in the house?
Nobody. Why?

1605
01:35:07,698 --> 01:35:10,618
What's that music?
A radio up the street.

1606
01:35:19,126 --> 01:35:22,046
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1607
01:35:22,129 --> 01:35:24,965
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

1608
01:35:25,299 --> 01:35:27,843
Only you were thinking
about murder.

1609
01:35:28,928 --> 01:35:30,804
I was thinking about
that anklet.

1610
01:35:30,888 --> 01:35:32,765
And what are you
thinking about now?

1611
01:35:32,806 --> 01:35:35,100
I'm all through thinking,
baby.

1612
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:37,603
I just came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?

1613
01:35:37,811 --> 01:35:41,815
Where are you going? You're the
one that's going, baby. Not me.

1614
01:35:42,107 --> 01:35:44,693
I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.

1615
01:35:44,777 --> 01:35:47,237
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1616
01:35:47,321 --> 01:35:50,783
All right, I'll tell you. A friend
of mine's got a funny theory.

1617
01:35:51,158 --> 01:35:54,119
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1618
01:35:54,203 --> 01:35:56,830
on a trolley car together. One
can't get off without the other.

1619
01:35:56,914 --> 01:35:59,208
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1620
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:01,585
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

1621
01:36:01,627 --> 01:36:03,962
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

1622
01:36:04,004 --> 01:36:07,174
Maybe he's got something
there. You bet he has.

1623
01:36:07,299 --> 01:36:10,010
Two people are gonna ride to
the end of the line, all right.

1624
01:36:10,093 --> 01:36:14,514
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1625
01:36:14,598 --> 01:36:18,060
Just who are you talking
about? An acquaintance of yours.

1626
01:36:18,143 --> 01:36:19,478
A Mr. Zachetti.

1627
01:36:19,519 --> 01:36:21,313
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1628
01:36:21,396 --> 01:36:24,024
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1629
01:36:24,107 --> 01:36:25,108
I was a sucker.

1630
01:36:25,192 --> 01:36:27,944
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1631
01:36:28,028 --> 01:36:30,697
Nobody wanted to brush you
off. Save it. I'm telling this.

1632
01:36:31,156 --> 01:36:33,200
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

1633
01:36:33,283 --> 01:36:34,868
That's not true.

1634
01:36:34,951 --> 01:36:38,079
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1635
01:36:39,331 --> 01:36:42,834
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1636
01:36:42,918 --> 01:36:45,962
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1637
01:36:46,046 --> 01:36:49,424
What's happening to me all
this time? Don't be silly, baby.

1638
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:58,850
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1639
01:36:58,933 --> 01:37:00,226
That's what Keyes thinks.

1640
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:02,562
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

1641
01:37:02,645 --> 01:37:06,983
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1642
01:37:07,025 --> 01:37:08,902
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1643
01:37:09,027 --> 01:37:13,531
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1644
01:37:13,865 --> 01:37:17,911
And if it was you, they'd charge that
up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1645
01:37:17,994 --> 01:37:21,664
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

1646
01:37:22,123 --> 01:37:24,626
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1647
01:37:24,667 --> 01:37:28,129
With the cops right behind
him. It's all taken care of.

1648
01:37:29,255 --> 01:37:31,507
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1649
01:37:31,591 --> 01:37:35,511
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1650
01:37:35,553 --> 01:37:37,013
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

1651
01:37:37,263 --> 01:37:40,308
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1652
01:37:40,391 --> 01:37:42,727
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1653
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:44,228
so we can get the money
and be together.

1654
01:37:44,645 --> 01:37:47,773
That's cute. Say it again. He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

1655
01:37:47,857 --> 01:37:49,901
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1656
01:37:49,984 --> 01:37:51,944
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1657
01:37:52,028 --> 01:37:54,238
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

1658
01:37:54,322 --> 01:37:58,701
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1659
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:01,495
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1660
01:38:01,537 --> 01:38:05,624
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1661
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,127
We're both rotten.

1662
01:38:08,252 --> 01:38:09,920
Only you're
a little more rotten.

1663
01:38:10,004 --> 01:38:12,089
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1664
01:38:12,173 --> 01:38:15,676
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1665
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,804
Then somebody else would have come
along to take care of Zachetti for you.

1666
01:38:18,888 --> 01:38:21,599
That's the way you operate,
isn't it, baby? Suppose it is.

1667
01:38:21,682 --> 01:38:24,977
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1668
01:38:25,811 --> 01:38:29,481
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1669
01:38:45,247 --> 01:38:46,623
[Gun fires]

1670
01:38:49,793 --> 01:38:52,713
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1671
01:38:52,963 --> 01:38:54,715
Better try it again.

1672
01:38:57,509 --> 01:38:59,845
Maybe if I came
a little closer?

1673
01:39:10,355 --> 01:39:12,816
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1674
01:39:21,867 --> 01:39:24,244
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

1675
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:33,920
Don't tell me it's because you've
been in love with me all this time.

1676
01:39:34,004 --> 01:39:37,465
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1677
01:39:37,716 --> 01:39:40,927
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1678
01:39:41,011 --> 01:39:43,430
That's all you
ever meant to me...

1679
01:39:44,598 --> 01:39:46,349
until a minute ago...

1680
01:39:47,475 --> 01:39:50,103
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

1681
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:54,441
I never thought
that could happen to me.

1682
01:39:55,442 --> 01:39:57,986
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy.

1683
01:39:58,069 --> 01:39:59,821
Just hold me close.

1684
01:40:06,244 --> 01:40:07,746
Goodbye, baby.

1685
01:40:07,912 --> 01:40:09,706
[Gun fires twice]

1686
01:41:02,383 --> 01:41:03,634
Zachetti.

1687
01:41:05,803 --> 01:41:07,138
Come here.

1688
01:41:13,019 --> 01:41:14,687
I said, come here.

1689
01:41:17,398 --> 01:41:20,443
My name is Neff. Yeah,
and I still don't like it.

1690
01:41:20,526 --> 01:41:22,153
What do you want?

1691
01:41:22,236 --> 01:41:23,529
Look, kid.

1692
01:41:24,697 --> 01:41:27,950
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1693
01:41:28,117 --> 01:41:30,202
What's the gag? Suppose you
go on back down the hill...

1694
01:41:30,244 --> 01:41:31,871
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

1695
01:41:31,912 --> 01:41:34,039
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

1696
01:41:34,081 --> 01:41:35,875
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1697
01:41:35,916 --> 01:41:38,502
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1698
01:41:38,586 --> 01:41:39,670
She isn't worth a nickel.

1699
01:41:39,753 --> 01:41:42,214
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1700
01:41:42,298 --> 01:41:43,340
Tough, aren't you?

1701
01:41:43,424 --> 01:41:45,426
Here, take the nickel and
call her. She wants you to.

1702
01:41:45,509 --> 01:41:47,261
She doesn't want
any part of me.

1703
01:41:47,553 --> 01:41:50,097
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1704
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,683
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1705
01:41:52,766 --> 01:41:55,018
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1706
01:41:55,102 --> 01:41:58,355
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1707
01:41:59,022 --> 01:42:00,607
Go on. That way.

1708
01:42:10,868 --> 01:42:13,036
(Walter)
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1709
01:42:14,413 --> 01:42:15,455
It's cold.

1710
01:42:17,541 --> 01:42:21,128
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house...

1711
01:42:21,211 --> 01:42:23,338
or if they've found her
by now.

1712
01:42:25,007 --> 01:42:28,301
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1713
01:42:29,302 --> 01:42:30,762
[Coughing]

1714
01:42:32,597 --> 01:42:35,559
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1715
01:42:36,435 --> 01:42:41,398
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1716
01:42:43,066 --> 01:42:46,736
And I want you to take care
of her and that guy Zachetti...

1717
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:54,160
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1718
01:42:56,121 --> 01:42:57,580
Hello, Keyes.

1719
01:43:07,549 --> 01:43:09,676
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1720
01:43:11,094 --> 01:43:14,431
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1721
01:43:15,181 --> 01:43:18,351
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

1722
01:43:18,434 --> 01:43:20,019
The janitor did.

1723
01:43:20,854 --> 01:43:23,481
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

1724
01:43:23,565 --> 01:43:24,649
Yeah.

1725
01:43:25,108 --> 01:43:26,985
Wouldn't be surprised.

1726
01:43:28,444 --> 01:43:31,990
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1727
01:43:32,365 --> 01:43:33,783
So I gather.

1728
01:43:35,451 --> 01:43:38,788
How long have you been
standing there? Long enough.

1729
01:43:38,871 --> 01:43:41,874
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1730
01:43:42,792 --> 01:43:44,752
One you didn't
quite figure out.

1731
01:43:44,836 --> 01:43:47,255
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1732
01:43:47,922 --> 01:43:50,633
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1733
01:43:51,926 --> 01:43:54,512
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

1734
01:43:55,555 --> 01:43:58,474
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

1735
01:43:59,684 --> 01:44:01,477
Let's have it, Keyes.

1736
01:44:02,854 --> 01:44:06,065
Walter, you're all washed up.

1737
01:44:08,651 --> 01:44:11,195
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1738
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:14,657
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1739
01:44:16,867 --> 01:44:19,495
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1740
01:44:20,579 --> 01:44:23,249
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1741
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:26,710
So I can walk into that gas chamber
up at San Quentin on my own power?

1742
01:44:26,794 --> 01:44:28,379
Is that it, Keyes?

1743
01:44:28,462 --> 01:44:30,089
Something like that.

1744
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:33,384
I've got a different idea.
Yeah?

1745
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:34,802
Look, Keyes.

1746
01:44:35,177 --> 01:44:37,596
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

1747
01:44:37,638 --> 01:44:40,015
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1748
01:44:40,099 --> 01:44:42,685
After that you can
play it any way you like.

1749
01:44:42,768 --> 01:44:45,354
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

1750
01:44:45,646 --> 01:44:49,566
Give me one good reason. I need
four hours to get where I'm going.

1751
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:52,820
You're not going anywhere,
Walter. You bet I am.

1752
01:44:53,737 --> 01:44:56,615
I'm going across the border.
You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1753
01:44:56,699 --> 01:44:58,242
Good enough to try for.

1754
01:44:58,325 --> 01:45:01,787
You'll never make the border.
That's what you think.

1755
01:45:02,454 --> 01:45:03,956
Just watch me.

1756
01:45:04,415 --> 01:45:06,583
You'll never even make
the elevator.

1757
01:45:06,792 --> 01:45:07,793
So long, Keyes.

1758
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,608
[Phone dialing]

1759
01:45:37,447 --> 01:45:38,740
(Keyes)
Hello...

1760
01:45:38,824 --> 01:45:41,451
send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1761
01:45:43,662 --> 01:45:45,622
Yeah. It's a police job.

1762
01:46:05,433 --> 01:46:07,978
How you doing, Walter?
Fine.

1763
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:13,775
Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away.

1764
01:46:14,317 --> 01:46:16,069
They're on the way.

1765
01:46:20,406 --> 01:46:23,034
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1766
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:24,619
I'll tell you.

1767
01:46:25,161 --> 01:46:28,414
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1768
01:46:28,498 --> 01:46:31,125
He was right across
the desk from you.

1769
01:46:31,334 --> 01:46:33,294
Closer than that, Walter.

1770
01:46:34,212 --> 01:46:35,588
[Panting]

1771
01:46:37,465 --> 01:46:38,967
I love you, too.
