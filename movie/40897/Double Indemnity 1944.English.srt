{3570}{3665}Hello there, Mr. Neff.
{3905}{4012}- Working pretty late aren't you, Mr. Neff?|- Late enough. Let's ride.
{4087}{4161}- You look kind of all in at that.|- I'm fine.
{4162}{4257}- How's the insurance business, Mr. Neff?|- Okay.
{4258}{4353}They wouldn't ever sell me any. |They say I've got something loose in my heart.
{4354}{4449}- Uh-huh.|- I say it's rheumatism.
{4460}{4557}Twelve.
{7262}{7329}Office memorandum
{7330}{7426}Walter Neff to Barton Keyes, Claims Manager.
{7430}{7527}Los Angeles, July 16th, 1938.
{7528}{7602}Dear Keyes:
{7602}{7678}I suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it.
{7679}{7744}I don't like the word confession.
{7745}{7841}I just want to set you right about one thing you couldn't see,| because it was smack up against your nose.
{7865}{7961}You think you're such a hot potato as a claims manager,|such a wolf on a phoney claim.
{7980}{8036}Well, maybe you are, Keyes
{8037}{8113}but let's take a look at this Dietrichson claim
{8114}{8187}Accident and Double Indemnity.
{8188}{8264}You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes.
{8264}{8338}You said it wasn't an accident. Check.
{8338}{8420}You said it wasn't suicide. Check.
{8421}{8485}You said it was murder.
{8485}{8542}Check.
{8543}{8605}You thought you had it cold, didn't you?
{8606}{8688}All wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it.
{8689}{8734}It was perfect
{8735}{8808}except that it wasn't, because you made a mistake
{8809}{8885}just one tiny little mistake.
{8886}{8982}When it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy.
{9001}{9082}Want to know who killed Dietrichson?
{9083}{9179}Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.
{9183}{9228}I killed Dietrichson.
{9229}{9276}Me, Walter Neff
{9277}{9374}insurance salesman, 35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars.
{9430}{9513}Until a little while ago, that is.
{9515}{9592}Yes, I killed him.
{9593}{9645}I killed him for money
{9646}{9727}and a woman
{9728}{9803}and I didn't get the money and I...
{9804}{9881}didn't get the woman.
{9882}{9977}Pretty, isn't it?
{10251}{10331}It began last May.
{10332}{10405}About the end of May, it was.
{10406}{10502}I had to run out to Glendale|to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks.
{10507}{10593}On the way back I remembered|this auto renewal on Los Feliz Blvd.
{10594}{10643}So I decided to run over there.
{10644}{10740}It was one of those California spanish houses|everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago.
{10762}{10846}This one must have cost somebody about 30,000 bucks
{10847}{10943}that is, if he ever finished paying for it.
{10970}{11034}- Mr. Dietrichson in?|- Who wants to see him?
{11035}{11111}- The name is Neff. Walter Neff.|- If you're selling something...
{11112}{11208}- It's Mr. Dietrichson I'd like to talk to, not subscriptions.|- Listen, Mr. Dietrichson's not in.
{11219}{11287}- How soon do you expect him?|- He'll be home when he gets here, if that's any help to you.
{11288}{11384}- What is it, Nettie? Who is it?|- It's for Mr. Dietrichson.
{11387}{11483}- I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?|- How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{11485}{11561}- I'm Walter Neff, Pacific All-Risk.|- Pacific all-what?
{11562}{11658}Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company.|It's about some renewals on the automobiles.
{11668}{11753}I've been trying to contact your husband for the past|two weeks. He's never at his office.
{11754}{11805}Is there anything I can do?
{11806}{11877}The insurance ran out on the fifteenth.|I'd hate to think of your getting
{11878}{11974}a smashed fender or something while you're not fully covered.
{11992}{12052}Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff.
{12054}{12157}- I've just been taking a sun bath.|- No pigeons around, I hope...
{12165}{12260}- About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson... I hate to take up your time...|- That's all right.
{12267}{12334}If you can wait till I put something on, I'll be right down.
{12335}{12431}Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room.
{12474}{12561}- Where would the living room be?|- In there, but they keep the liquor locked up.
{12562}{12658}That's okay. I always carry my own keys.
{12808}{12904}The living room was still stuffy from last night's cigars.
{12920}{12960}The windows were closed|and the sunshine coming in through
{12961}{13056}the Venetian blinds showed up the dust in the air.
{13075}{13226}On the piano, in couple of fancy frames,|were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter by his first wife.
{13253}{13373}They had a bowl of those little red|goldfish on the table behind the davenport,
{13375}{13471}but, to tell you the truth, Keyes, |I wasn't a whole lot interested in goldfish right then,
{13476}{13572}nor in auto renewals, nor in|Mr. Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.
{13574}{13664}I was thinking about that dame upstairs|and the way she had looked at me
{13664}{13781}and I wanted to see her again, close|without that silly staircase between us.
{13927}{13984}- I wasn't long, was I?|- Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{13985}{14038}I hope I've got my face on straight.
{14039}{14103}- It's perfect for my money.|- Neff is the name, isn't it?
{14105}{14182}- With two f's, like in Philadelphia. If you know the story.|- What story?
{14183}{14225}The Philadelphia Story.
{14227}{14261}Suppose we sit down and you tell me about the insurance.
{14262}{14399}- My husband never tells me anything.|- It's on your two cars, the La Salle and the Plymouth.
{14445}{14573}We've been handling this insurance for 3 years|and we hate to see these policies lapse.
{14597}{14683}That's a honey of an anklet|you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{14684}{14744}As I was saying, we'd hate to see the policies lapse.
{14745}{14803}Of course, we give him 30 days.|That's all we're allowed to give.
{14804}{14868}I guess he's been too busy down|at Long Beach in the oil fields.
{14869}{14918}Could I catch him home some evening for a few minutes?
{14919}{15010}- I suppose so. But he's never home much before eight.|- That would be fine with me.
{15011}{15093}- You're not connected with the Automobile Club, are you?|- No, the All-Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{15094}{15190}- Why?|- Somebody from the Automobile Club tried to get him.
{15190}{15261}- Do they have a better rate?|- If your husband's a member.
{15262}{15359}- No, he isn't.|- Well, he'd have to buy the membership to start with.
{15365}{15436}I never knock the other|fellow's merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{15437}{15489}The Automobile Club is fine.
{15490}{15586}I can do just as well for you, though.|I have a very attractive policy here.
{15591}{15648}It wouldn't take me two minutes|to put it in front of your husband.
{15649}{15745}For instance, we're writing a new kind of|50% retention feature in the collision coverage.
{15774}{15870}- You're a smart insurance man, aren't you, Mr. Neff?|- I've had 11 years of it.
{15874}{15960}- Doing pretty well?|- It's a living.
{15961}{16056}- You handle just automobile insurance or all kinds?|- All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft...
{16073}{16170}public liability, group insurance, industrial stuff and so on.
{16173}{16276}- Accident insurance?|- Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{16313}{16403}I wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.
{16404}{16499}- Just my name.|- As for instance?
{16500}{16592}- Phyllis.|- Phyllis. I think I like that.
{16593}{16689}- But you're not sure?|- I'd have to drive it around the block a couple of times.
{16707}{16773}Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening about 8:30 ?
{16774}{16818}- He'll be in then.|- Who?
{16819}{16897}My husband. You were anxious to talk to him weren't you?
{16898}{16994}Yeah I was but I'm only getting|over it a little. If you know what I mean.
{17003}{17092}There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.
{17093}{17175}- How fast was I going, officer?|- I'd say about 90.
{17176}{17231}Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket.
{17232}{17328}- Suppose I let you off with a warning this time.|- Suppose it doesn't take.
{17330}{17387}Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.
{17388}{17456}Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder.
{17457}{17565}- Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder.|- That tears it.
{17678}{17756}- Eight-thirty tomorrow evening then, Mrs. Dietrichson.|- That's what I suggested.
{17757}{17820}- Will you be here, too?|- I guess so. I usually am.
{17821}{17935}- Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?|- I wonder if I know what you mean.
{17956}{18052}I wonder if you wonder.
{18090}{18186}It was a hard-afternoon and I can still|remember the smell of honeysuckle in that street.
{18219}{18315}How could I have known that murder|sometimes can smell like honeysuckle...
{18323}{18408}Maybe you would've known Keyes|the minute she mentioned the accident insurance.
{18409}{18504}But I didn't. I felt like a million.
{18505}{18588}I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.
{18589}{18685}It was the day you had that truck driver|from Inglewood on the carpet. Remember Keyes?
{18692}{18788}Oh, Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see you.|He's been yelling for you all afternoon.
{18802}{18932}Is he sore, or just frothing at the mouth a little?|Here, park these for me, sweetheart.
{19107}{19202}C'mon, Gorlopis. You're not kidding anybody|with that line of bull. You're in a jam and you know it.
{19214}{19310}- Sez you. All I want is my money.|- Sez you. All you're gonna get is the cops.
{19322}{19418}- Come in, Walter. This is Sam Gorlopis from Inglewood.|- Sure, I know Mr. Gorlopis.
{19429}{19525}- Wrote a policy on his truck. How are you, Mr. Gorlopis?|- I ain't so good. My truck burned down.
{19556}{19619}Yeah! Now look, Gorlopis.
{19620}{19679}Every month hundreds of claims come to this desk.
{19680}{19819}Some of them are phonies, and I know which ones.|How do I know? Because my little man tells me.
{19835}{19926}- What little man?|- The little man in here.
{19927}{20022}Every time one of those phonies comes along|he ties knots in my stomach. I can't eat.
{20030}{20103}And yours was one of them, Gorlopis.|That's how I knew your claim was crooked.
{20104}{20142}So what did I do?
{20143}{20239}I sent a tow car out to your garage this afternoon|and they jacked up that burned-out truck of yours.
{20255}{20291}And what did they find?
{20292}{20393}- They found what was left of a pile of shavings.|- What shavings?
{20412}{20508}The ones you soaked with|kerosene and dropped a match on.
{20529}{20664}- Look, mister, I'm just a poor guy. Maybe I made a mistake. |- That's one way of putting it.
{20700}{20796}- I ain't feelin' so good, Mr. Keyes.|- Sign this and you'll feel fine.
{20803}{20899}- Sign what?|- Right there. It's a waiver on your claim.
{21023}{21149}- Now you're an honest man again. Goodbye, Gorlopis.|- But I ain't got no more truck.
{21150}{21219}$2600. That's a lot of dough where I live.
{21220}{21269}What's the matter, Gorlopis?|Don't you know how to open the door?
{21270}{21366}Just put your hand on the knob, turn it to the left
{21371}{21469}- pull it toward you... that's the boy.|- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.
{21627}{21674}What kind of an outfit is this anyway?
{21675}{21730}Are we an insurance company,|or a bunch of dimwitted amateurs
{21731}{21811}- ...writing a policy on a mugg like that?|- Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef.
{21812}{21902}I clipped a note to that Gorlopis application to have him|thoroughly investigated before we accepted the risk.
{21903}{21969}I know you did, Walter. I'm not beefing at you.|It's the company. The way they do things.
{21970}{22066}The way they don't do things. The way they'll write|anything just to get it down on the sales sheet.
{22069}{22144}And I'm the guy that has to sit|here up to my neck in phony claims
{22145}{22197}so they won't throw more money out of|the window than they take in at the door.
{22198}{22294}- Okay, turn the record over and let's hear the other side.|- I get darn sick of picking up after a gang
{22299}{22377}of fast-talking salesmen dumb enough to sell life|insurance to a guy that sleeps in the same bed
{22378}{22420}with four rattlesnakes.
{22421}{22517}- I've had 26 years of that, and I...|- And you loved every minute of it, Keyes. You love it,
{22550}{22636}Only you worry about it too much,|you and your little man.
{22637}{22703}You're so darn conscientious|you're driving yourself crazy.
{22704}{22758}You wouldn't even say today is|Tuesday without you looked at the calendar
{22759}{22821}and then you would check if it|was this year's or last year's calendar
{22821}{22859}and then you would find out|what company printed the calendar
{22860}{22909}then find out if their calendar|checks with the World Almanac's calendar.
{22910}{23027}That's enough from you, Walter.|Get out of here before I throw my desk at you.
{23121}{23217}I love you, too.
{23327}{23423}I really did, too, you old crab, always yelling|your fat head off, always sore at everybody.
{23454}{23537}You never fooled me... not for a second.
{23538}{23684}The kind I always knew that behind the cigar ashes|on your vest you had a heart as big as a house...
{23687}{23783}Back in my office there was a phone message|from Mrs. Dietrichson about the renewals.
{23798}{23866}She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening.
{23867}{23963}She wanted me to come|Thursday afternoon at 3:30 instead.
{23969}{24044}I had a lot of stuff lined up for that Thursday afternoon,
{24045}{24188}including a trip down to Santa Monica to see a couple|of live prospects about some group insurance.
{24192}{24329}But I kept thinking about Phyllis Dietrichson|and the way that anklet of hers cut into her leg.
{24502}{24592}Hello, Mr. Neff. Aren't you coming in?
{24593}{24677}I'm considering it.
{24678}{24774}I hope you didn't mind my changing the appointment.|Last night wasn't so convenient.
{24777}{24872}- That's alright. I was working on my stamp collection.|- I was just fixing some iced tea.
{24883}{24959}- Would you like a glass?|- Unless you have a bottle of beer that's not working.
{24960}{25063}There might be some.|I never know what's in the ice box. Nettie!...
{25159}{25250}- About those renewals, Mr. Neff.|I talked to my husband about it.
{25251}{25307}- You did?| Yes. He'll renew with you he told me so.
{25308}{25363}In fact, I thought he'd be here this afternoon.
{25364}{25460}- But he's not?|- No.|- That's terrible.
{25486}{25582}Nettie!... Nettie!... Oh, I forgot, it's the maid's day off.
{25640}{25733}- Nevermind the beer, ice tea will be fine.|- Lemon? Sugar?
{25733}{25806}Fix it your way.
{25807}{25903}Seeing it's the maid's day off maybe there's something|I can do for you. Like running the vacuum cleaner.
{25949}{26038}- Fresh.|- I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.
{26039}{26197}- Not much money but you learn a lot about life.|- I didn't think you learned it from a correspondence course.
{26215}{26264}Where did you pick up this tea drinking?
{26265}{26361}- You're not English, are you?|- No. Californian. Born right here in Los Angeles.
{26371}{26467}They say native Californians all come from Iowa.
{26472}{26538}- Mr. Neff, I.....|- Make it Walter.
{26539}{26595}- Walter.|- Right.
{26596}{26697}- Tell me, Walter... how much commission do you make?|- 20%. Why?
{26740}{26822}- I thought maybe I could throw more business your way.|- I can always use it.
{26824}{26919}I was thinking about my husband. I worry a lot|about him, down in those oil fields. It's very dangerous.
{26954}{27015}- Not for an executive, is it?|- He doesn't just sit behind a desk.
{27016}{27104}He's right down there with the|drilling crews. It's got me worried sick.
{27105}{27161}You mean some dark night|a crown block might fall on him?
{27162}{27223}- Please don't talk like that.|- But that's the idea.
{27224}{27320}The other day a casing line snapped and caught|the foreman. He's in the hospital with a broken back.
{27337}{27425}- Bad. |- It's got me jittery just thinking about it.
{27426}{27527}- Suppose something like that happened to my husband?|- It could.
{27558}{27658}- Don't you think he ought to have accident insurance?|- Uh-huh.
{27663}{27759}- What kind of insurance could he have?|- Enough to cover doctors' and hospital bills.
{27769}{27889}Say a 100 and 25 a week cash benefit. |And he'd rate around $50,000 capital sum.
{27889}{27981}- Capital sum? What's that?|- In case he gets killed.
{27982}{28047}Maybe I shouldn't have said that.
{28048}{28135}- I suppose you have to think of everything in your business.|- Your husband would understand.
{28136}{28231}I'm sure I could sell him on the idea of some|accident protection. Why don't I talk to him about it?
{28234}{28347}- You could try. But he's pretty tough going.|- They're all tough at first.
{28373}{28469}He's got a lot on his mind. He doesn't seem to want to|listen to anything except maybe baseball on the radio.
{28517}{28639}- Sometimes we sit all evening without a word to each other.|- Sounds pretty dull.
{28659}{28755}- So I just sit and knit.|- Is that what you married him for?
{28771}{28859}Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold up the wool.
{28860}{28957}Anytime his thumbs get tired...|with me around you wouldn't have to knit.
{28968}{29063}Wouldn't I?|- I bet your life you wouldn't.
{29096}{29192}Why not a little rum that gets this up on its feet?
{29229}{29325}I want to ask you something, Walter.
{29343}{29438}- Could I get him an accident policy without bothering him?|- How's that again?
{29446}{29514}That would make it easier for you, too.|You wouldn't even have to talk to him.
{29515}{29651}I have a little allowance of my own.|I could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.
{29705}{29785}- Why shouldn't he know?|- Because I know he doesn't want accident insurance.
{29786}{29882}- He's superstitious about it.|- A lot of people are. Funny, isn't it?
{29889}{29993}If there was a way to get it|like that, all the worry would be over.
{30007}{30080}- You see what I mean, Walter?|- Sure. I've got good eyesight.
{30081}{30152}You want him to have the policy without him knowing it.
{30153}{30226}And that means without the insurance|company knowing that he doesn't know.
{30227}{30296}- That's the set-up, isn't it?|- Is there anything wrong with it?
{30297}{30329}No, I think it's lovely.
{30330}{30410}And then, some dark wet night, if a crown block fell on him...|- What crown block?
{30411}{30490}Only sometimes it can't quite make|it on its own so it has to have a little help.
{30491}{30554}- I don't know what you're talking about.|- Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block.
{30555}{30628}It can be a car backing over him,|or he can fall out of an upstairs window.
{30629}{30724}- Any little thing like that, as long as it's a morgue job.|- Are you crazy?
{30725}{30790}Not that crazy.
{30791}{30887}- Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.|- What's the matter?
{30894}{30990}Look, baby, you can't get away with it.
{30996}{31073}- You want to knock him off, don't you.|- That's a horrible thing to say!
{31074}{31106}Who'd you think I was, anyway?
{31107}{31203}A guy that walks into a good-looking dame's front parlor|and says "Hello, I sell accident insurance on husbands.
{31210}{31284}You got one that's been around too long?|Somebody you'd like to turn into a little hard cash?
{31285}{31375}Just give me a smile and I'll help you collect."|Boy, what a dope you must think I am!
{31376}{31472}- I think you're rotten.|- I think you're swell. So long as I'm not your husband.
{31476}{31579}- Get out of here.|- You bet I'll get out of here, baby. But quick.
{31838}{31934}So I let her have it, straight between the eyes.|She didn't fool me for a minute, not this time.
{31968}{32064}I knew I had hold of a redhot poker and the|time to drop it was before it burned my hand off.
{32085}{32181}I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle |of beer, the one I had wanted all along,
{32184}{32337}only I wanted it worse now, to get rid of the sour|taste of her iced tea and everything that went with it.
{32337}{32464}I didn't want to go back to the office, so I dropped by|a bowling alley at Third and Western and rolled a few lines
{32467}{32559}to get my mind thinking about something else for a while.
{32561}{32656}I didn't feel like eating dinner|when I left, and I didn't feel like a show
{32662}{32759}so I drove home, put the car away|and went up to my apartment.
{32788}{32884}It had begun to rain outside and I watched it|get dark and didn't even turn on the light.
{32908}{33061}That didn't help me either. I was all twisted up|inside, and I was still holding on to that red-hot poker.
{33064}{33160}And right then it came over me that I hadn't walked out on anything at all,
{33164}{33277}that the hook was too strong,|that this wasn't the end between her and me.
{33279}{33347}It was only the beginning.
{33348}{33443}So at eight o'clock the bell would ring|and I would know who it was without even having to think,
{33462}{33558}as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
{33616}{33712}- Hello. You forgot your hat this afternoon.|- Did I?
{33736}{33832}- Don't you want me to bring it in?|- Sure.
{33852}{33948}Put it on the chair.
{34110}{34189}- How did you know where I live?|- It's in the phone book.
{34190}{34259}- It's raining.|- Yeah.
{34260}{34356}Peel off your coat and sit down.
{34382}{34452}- Your husband out?|- Yes, Long Beach. They're spudding in a new well.
{34453}{34529}He phoned he'd be late. About 9:30.
{34529}{34624}- It's about time you said you're glad to see me.|- I knew you wouldn't leave it like that.
{34625}{34694}- Like what?|- Like it was this afternoon.
{34695}{34775}I must have said something that|gave you a terribly wrong impression.
{34776}{34851}You must never think anything|like that about me, Walter.
{34852}{34921}- Okay.|- It's not okay. Not if you don't believe me.
{34922}{35019}- What do you want me to do?|- I want you to be nice to me.
{35031}{35149}- Like the first time you came to the house.|- It can't be like the first time.
{35155}{35244}- Something has happened.|- I know it has.
{35246}{35338}It's happened to us.
{35339}{35453}I feel as if he was watching me. |Not that he cares about me. Not any more.
{35461}{35535}But he keeps me on a leash.|So tight I can't breathe.
{35536}{35645}- He's in Long Beach, isn't he? Relax.|- Maybe I oughtn't to have come.
{35660}{35727}- Maybe you oughtn't.|- You want me to go?
{35728}{35790}- If you want to.|- Right now?
{35791}{35887}Sure. Right now.
{36205}{36288}- I'm crazy about you, baby.|- I'm crazy about you, Walter.
{36289}{36430}- That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it?|- I don't know. I bought it down at Ensenada.
{36455}{36543}We ought to have some of that pink wine|to go with it. The kind that bubbles.
{36544}{36602}But all I have is bourbon.
{36603}{36699}Bourbon is fine, Walter.
{36812}{36909}Get a couple of glasses, will you.
{37045}{37130}- Soda?|- Plain water, please.
{37131}{37228}You know, about six months ago a guy slipped on the soap|in his bathtub and knocked himself cold and drowned.
{37270}{37366}Only he had accident insurance. So they|had an autopsy and she didn't get away with it.
{37385}{37481}- Who didn't?|- His wife.
{37486}{37622}There was another case where a guy was found shot and|his wife said he shot his stomach while cleaning a gun.
{37640}{37734}All she collected was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.
{37735}{37831}Perhaps it was worth it to her.
{37842}{37938}See if you can carry this as far as the living room.
{37990}{38130}- It's nice here, Walter. Who takes care of it for you?|- A colored woman comes in twice a week.
{38132}{38207}- Cook your own breakfast?|- Once in a while I squeeze a grapefruit.
{38208}{38304}- The rest I get at the corner drugstore.|- It sounds wonderful. Just strangers beside you.
{38331}{38397}You don't know them. You don't hate them.
{38398}{38494}You don't have to sit across the table and smile at him|and that daughter of his every morning of your life.
{38507}{38632}- What daughter? Oh, that little girl on the piano.|- Mmm. Lola. She lives with us.
{38640}{38705}He thinks a lot more of her than he does of me.
{38706}{38769}- Ever think of a divorce?|- He wouldn't give me a divorce.
{38770}{38865}- I suppose because it would cost him money.|- He hasn't got money. Not since he went into oil business.
{38870}{38922}But he had when you married him?
{38922}{39019}Yes, he had. And I wanted a home. Why not?
{39049}{39104}But that wasn't the only reason.
{39105}{39170}I was his wife's nurse. She was sick for a long time.
{39171}{39242}When she died, he was all broken up.
{39243}{39306}- I.... pitied him so.|- And now you hate him.
{39307}{39380}Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me.
{39381}{39465}Every-time I buy a dress or a pair of shoes|he yells his head off. He won't let me go anywhere.
{39466}{39537}He keeps me shut up. He's always been mean to me.
{39538}{39634}Even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his.
{39645}{39699}- That Lola.|- Nothing for you at all, huh?
{39700}{39782}No. And nothing is just what I'm worth to him.
{39783}{39879}So you lie awake in the dark|and listen to him snore and get ideas.
{39883}{39960}Walter, I don't want to kill him. I never did.
{39961}{40057}Not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face.
{40095}{40166}- Only sometimes you wish he was dead.|- Perhaps I do.
{40167}{40263}And you wish it was an accident|and you had that policy. For $50,000.
{40266}{40362}- Is that it?|- Perhaps that too.
{40370}{40459}The other night we drove home|from a party. He was drunk again.
{40460}{40586}When we got into the garage he just sat there with|his head on the steering wheel and the motor still running.
{40594}{40689}And I thought what it would be like if I didn't switch it off
{40692}{40788}- ...just closed the garage door and left him there.|- I'll tell you what it would be like
{40788}{40884}if you had that accident policy, and tried to pull|a monoxide job. We have a guy in our office named Keyes.
{40906}{40977}For him a set-up like that would be|just like a slice of rare roast beef.
{40978}{41074}In 3 minutes he'd know it wasn't an accident.|In ten minutes you'd be sitting under the hot lights.
{41082}{41177}- In half an hour you'd be signing your name to a confession.|- But Walter, I didn't and I'm not going to do it.
{41182}{41278}Not if there's an insurance company in the picture, baby.|They know more tricks than a carload of monkeys.
{41285}{41346}And if there's a death mixed up|in it, you haven't got a prayer.
{41347}{41427}They'll hang you as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar.
{41428}{41524}And I don't want you to hang, baby.
{41549}{41645}Stop thinking about it, will you.
{41680}{41776}So we just sat there, and she started|crying softly, like the rain on the window
{41791}{41913}and we didn't say anything. Maybe she had|stopped thinking about it, but I hadn't.
{41918}{42014}I couldn't. Because it all tied up with|something I had been thinking about for years
{42018}{42109}since long before I ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.
{42110}{42257}Because, in this business you can't sleep for|trying to figure out the tricks they could pull on you.
{42268}{42384}You're like the guy behind the roulette wheel, watching|the customers to make sure they don't crook the house.
{42392}{42476}And then one night, you get to thinking|how you could crook the house yourself.
{42477}{42562}And do it smart. Because you've|got that wheel right under your hands.
{42563}{42620}And you know every notch in it by heart.
{42621}{42689}And you figure all you need is a plant out in front
{42690}{42753}a shill to put down the bet.
{42754}{42888}And suddenly the doorbell rings and the whole|set-up is right there in the room with you...
{42940}{43035}Look, Keyes, I'm not trying to whitewash myself.
{43036}{43132}I fought it, only... I guess I didn't fight it hard enough.
{43158}{43254}The stakes were $50,000,|but they were the life of a man, too
{43264}{43341}a man who'd never done me any dirt, except...
{43342}{43438}he was married to a woman|he didn't care anything about
{43440}{43537}and I did...
{43767}{43821}Will you phone me?
{43822}{43905}Walter!
{43905}{44002}I hate him. I loathe going back to him.|You believe me, don't you, Walter?
{44016}{44112}Sure I believe you.
{44117}{44245}- I can't stand it anymore. What if they did hang me?|- You're not going to hang, baby.
{44247}{44343}- It's better than going on this way.|- ...because you're gonna do it and I'm gonna help you.
{44357}{44422}- Do you know what you're saying?|- Sure I know what I'm saying.
{44423}{44507}We're gonna do it and we're gonna|do it right. And I'm the guy that knows how.
{44508}{44572}- Walter, you're hurting me.|- There isn't going to be any slip up.
{44573}{44668}Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.|It's got to be perfect.
{44956}{45052}Call me tomorrow. But not from your house.|From a booth. And watch your step. Every single minute.
{45057}{45152}It's got to be perfect, understand.|Straight down the line.
{45153}{45249}Straight down the line.
{46239}{46285}That was it Keyes.
{46286}{46370}The machine reels started the movement|and nothing could stop it.
{46371}{46463}The first thing we had to do was|fix him up with that accident policy.
{46464}{46560}I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted|was his signature on an application.
{46565}{46661}So I had to make him sign|without his knowing what he was signing.
{46666}{46777}And I wanted a witness besides Phyllis|to hear me give him a sales talk.
{46783}{46879}I was trying to think with your brains, Keyes.|I wanted all the answers ready for all the...
{46889}{46985}questions you were going to spring|as soon as Dietrichson was dead.
{46987}{47065}A couple of nights later I went to the house.
{47065}{47161}Everything looked fine, |except I didn't like the witness Phyllis had brought in.
{47174}{47247}It was Dietrichson's daughter Lola
{47248}{47316}and it made me feel a little queer in the belly to....
{47317}{47409}have her sitting right there|in the room, playing Chinese checkers,
{47410}{47490}as if nothing was going to happen.
{47491}{47558}I suppose you realize, Mr. Dietrichson,|that, not being an employee,
{47559}{47636}you are not covered by |the State Compensation Insurance Act.
{47637}{47702}The only way you can protect yourself|is by having a personal policy of your own.
{47703}{47757}Yeah! I know all about that. |The next thing you'll tell me
{47758}{47854}I need earthquake insurance|and lightning insurance and hail insurance.
{47857}{47944}If we bought all the insurance they can think up,|we'd stay broke paying for it, wouldn't we, honey?
{47945}{48041}What keeps us broke is you going out and buying five|hats at a crack. Who needs a hat in California?
{48085}{48178}Dollar for dollar, accident insurance|is the cheapest coverage you can buy.
{48179}{48275}- Maybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I had a tough day. |- Just as you say.
{48283}{48388}- Suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight.|- Sure.
{48391}{48470}All we need on that is for you|to sign an application for renewal.
{48471}{48568}- Phyllis, mind if we don't finish this game? It bores me stiff.|- Got some thing better to do?
{48580}{48639}Yes, I have.
{48640}{48720}- Father, is it all right if I run along now?|- Run along where? Who with?
{48722}{48780}- Just Anne. We're going roller skating.|- Anne who?
{48781}{48850}- Anne Matthews.|- It's not that Nino Zachetti again?
{48851}{48947}- It better not be that Zachetti guy. If I ever catch you...|- It's Anne Matthews, I told you.
{48959}{49047}I also told you we're going roller skating. |I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont and Franklin
{49048}{49134}the north-west corner, in case|you're interested. And I'm late already.
{49135}{49207}I hope that is all clear. Father.
{49207}{49262}- Good night, Phyllis.|- Good night, Miss Dietrichson.
{49263}{49313}- Oh, I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... |- ...Neff.
{49314}{49410}Good night, Mr. Neff.
{49428}{49514}A great little fighter for her weight.
{49515}{49579}- Now if you just sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.|- Sign what?
{49580}{49668}The applications for your auto renewals.|So you'll be protected until the new policies are issued.
{49669}{49708}- When will that be?|- In about a week.
{49709}{49780}- Just so I'm covered when I drive up North.|- San Francisco?
{49781}{49840}- Palo Alto.|- He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff.
{49841}{49929}- And he still goes to his class reunion every year.|- What's wrong with that?
{49930}{50025}- Can't I have a little fun even once a year?|- Great football school, Stanford.
{50026}{50111}- Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?|- Left guard. Almost made the varsity, too.
{50112}{50208}- Where do I sign?|- Bottom line.
{50273}{50329}- Both copies, please.|- Sign twice, huh?
{50330}{50456}- One is the agent's copy. I need it for my files.|- Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.
{50587}{50622}Thank you, Mr. Dietrichson.
{50623}{50684}No hurry about the check, Mr. Dietrichson.|I can pick it up at your office some morning.
{50685}{50744}- How much you taking me for?|- One forty-seven fifty.
{50745}{50852}- I guess that's enough insurance for one evening, Mr. Neff.|- Plenty.
{50942}{51010}Bring me some soda when you come up, Phyllis.|Good night, Mr. Neff.
{51011}{51133}- Good night, Mr. Dietrichson. |- I think you left your hat in the hall, Mr. Neff.
{51467}{51563}Good night, Mr. Neff.
{51580}{51595}- All right, Walter?|- Fine.
{51596}{51654}- He signed it, didn't he?|- Sure he signed it. You saw him.
{51655}{51704}- Listen. That trip to Palo Alto When does he go?|- End of the month.
{51705}{51739}- He drives, huh?|- He always drives.
{51740}{51783}- Not this time. You're going to make him take the train.|- Why?
{51784}{51845}Because it's all worked out for a train. Listen, baby.
{51847}{51930}There's a clause in every accident policy,|a little something called double indemnity.
{51931}{51999}The insurance companies put it in|as a sort of come-on for the customers.
{52000}{52056}It means they pay double on certain accidents.
{52057}{52102}The kind that almost never happen.
{52103}{52152}Like for instance if a guy got killed on a train
{52153}{52241}- they'd pay a $100,000 instead of $50,000.|- I see.
{52242}{52351}We're hitting it for the limit, baby.|That's why it's got to be a train.
{52372}{52438}It'll be the train, Walter. Just the way you want it.
{52439}{52535}Straight down the line.
{52952}{53025}Hello, Mr. Neff.
{53026}{53071}It's me.
{53072}{53131}- Anything wrong?|- I've been waiting for you.
{53132}{53239}- For me? Why?|- I thought you could drive me, if you're going my way.
{53362}{53447}- Which way would that be?|- Down the hill. Down Vermont.
{53448}{53519}Oh, sure. Vermont and Franklin.|North-west corner, wasn't it?
{53520}{53616}Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.
{53654}{53767}- Roller skating, eh? You like roller skating?|- I can take it or leave it.
{53820}{53864}Only tonight you're leaving it?
{53865}{53921}Yes, I am.
{53923}{53979}I'm having a very tough time at home.
{53980}{54073}My father doesn't understand me and Phyllis hates me.
{54074}{54162}- That does sound tough, all right.|- That's why I have to lie sometimes.
{54163}{54241}- You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin?|- It's Vermont and Franklin all right.
{54242}{54298}Only it's not Anne Matthews.
{54299}{54346}It's Nino Zachetti.
{54347}{54421}- You won't tell on me, will you?|- I'd have to think it over.
{54422}{54500}Nino's not what my father says at all.|He just had bad luck.
{54501}{54597}He was doing pre-med at U.S.C. and working|nights as an usher in a theater downtown.
{54609}{54682}He got behind in his credits and flunked out.
{54683}{54756}Then he lost his job for talking back.
{54757}{54807}He's so hot-headed.
{54808}{54895}- That comes expensive, doesn't it?|- I guess my father thinks nobody's good enough for me
{54896}{55004}except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil.|I wish he'd see it my way.
{55016}{55078}I can't give Nino up.
{55079}{55173}- It'll straighten out all right, Miss Dietrichson.|- I suppose it will sometime.
{55174}{55270}This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.
{55294}{55391}Nino! Over here Nino!
{55559}{55629}- This is Mr. Neff, Nino.|- Hello, Nino.
{55630}{55687}- The name is Zachetti.|- Nino. Please.
{55688}{55751}Mr. Neff gave me a ride from the house. |I told him all about us.
{55752}{55840}- Why does he have to get told about us?|- We don't have to worry about Mr. Neff, Nino.
{55841}{55937}- I'm not worrying. Just don't you broadcast so much.|- What's the matter with you, Nino?
{55955}{56013}- He's a friend.|- I don't have any friends.
{56014}{56071}And if I did, I like to pick them myself. C'mon!
{56072}{56167}Look, sonny, she needed the ride and I brought her along.|Is that anything to get tough about?
{56189}{56305}- All right, Lola, make up your mind. Coming or not?|- Of course I'm coming.
{56350}{56447}Don't mind him, Mr. Neff. |Thanks a lot. You're awfully sweet.
{56619}{56663}She was a nice kid
{56664}{56740}and maybe he was a little better than he sounded.
{56741}{56821}But right then it gave me |a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all
{56822}{56908}with that briefcase right behind|my head and her father's signature in it.
{56909}{56967}And what that signature meant.
{56968}{57020}He was a dead pigeon.
{57021}{57116}It was only a question of time, not much time at then.
{57117}{57200}You know that big market up on Los Feliz, Keyes?
{57201}{57286}That's the place Phyllis|and I had picked for a meeting place.
{57287}{57383}I already had most of the plan in my head,|but a lot of details had to be worked out.
{57400}{57493}And she had to know them|all by heart, when the time came.
{57494}{57554}We had to be very careful from now on.
{57555}{57620}We couldn't let anybody see us together.
{57621}{57694}We couldn't even talk|to each other on the telephone.
{57695}{57777}Not from her house or at my office anyway.
{57778}{57874}So she used to be in the market|every morning about 11 o'clock buying stuff.
{57890}{57977}And I could sort of run into|her there any day I wanted to.
{57978}{58049}Sort of accidentally on purpose.
{58050}{58144}- Walter, I ....|- Not so loud.
{58146}{58218}- I wanted to talk to you ever since yesterday.|- Let me talk first.
{58220}{58299}It's all set. The accident policy|came through. I've got it in my pocket.
{58300}{58342}I got his check too.
{58343}{58421}I saw him down in the oil fields. |He thought he was paying for the auto insurance.
{58422}{58493}The check's just made out |to the company. It could be for anything.
{58494}{58562}But you have to send a check for the auto insurance, see.
{58563}{58637}It's all right that way,|because one of the cars is in your name.
{58638}{58734}Quick, open your bag.
{58810}{58867}- Can you get into his safe deposit box?|- Yes. We both have keys.
{58868}{58948}Fine. But don't put the policy in there yet.|I'll tell you when.
{58949}{59001}- And remember, you never touched it|or even saw it, understand?
{59002}{59083}- I'm not a fool.|- Okay. When is he taking the train?
{59084}{59114}- That's just it. He isn't going.|- What?
{59115}{59233}- That's what I've been trying to tell you. The trip is off.|- What's happened?
{59239}{59340}Mister, could you reach me|that can of coffee? That one up there!
{59398}{59504}I don't see why they always have|to put what I want on the top shelf.
{59540}{59617}- Go ahead. I'm listening.|- He had a fall down at the well. Broke his leg. It's in a cast.
{59618}{59689}- Broke his leg?|- What do we do, Walter?
{59690}{59754}- Nothing. Just wait.|- Wait for what?
{59755}{59851}- Until he can take a train. I told you it's got to be a train.|- But we can't wait. I can't go on like this.
{59863}{59948}- We won't grab a hammer and do it fast, just to get over it.|- There are other ways.
{59949}{59991}Only we're not going to do it other ways.
{59992}{60081}But we can't leave it like this. What do you think|would happen if he found out about this accident policy?
{60081}{60174}- Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in that death-house.|- Don't ever talk like that.
{60175}{60310}- Just don't let's start losing our heads.|- It's not our heads. It's our nerve we're losing.
{60362}{60457}Excuse me.
{60466}{60546}- We're going to do it right. That's all I said.|- It's the waiting that gets me.
{60547}{60607}It's getting me just as bad, baby. But we've got to wait.
{60608}{60653}Maybe we have, Walter. Only...
{60654}{60709}it's so tough without you.
{60710}{60783}It's like a wall between us.
{60784}{60879}I better go baby. I'm thinking of you every minute.
{61014}{61100}After that a full week went by and I didn't see her once.
{61101}{61188}I tried to keep my mind off her and off the whole idea.
{61189}{61346}I kept telling myself that maybe those fates watching over|you had gotten together and broken his leg to give a way out.
{61348}{61408}Then it was the 15th of June.
{61409}{61479}You may remember that date, Keyes.
{61480}{61572}You came into my office around 3 in the afternoon...
{61573}{61605}Hello, Keyes.
{61606}{61636}I just came from Norton's office.
{61638}{61697}The semi-annual sales records are out.|You're high man, Walter.
{61698}{61771}- That's twice in a row. Congratulations.|- Thanks.
{61772}{61814}How would you like a cheap drink?
{61815}{61883}How would you like a $50 cut in salary?
{61883}{61968}- Do I laugh now or wait until it gets funny?|- I'm serious, Walter. I've been talking to Norton.
{61969}{62046}There's too much stuff piling up on my desk.|Too much pressure on my nerves.
{62047}{62123}I spend half the night walking up and down in my bed.|I've got to have an assistant.
{62125}{62179}- I thought that you...|- Me? Why pick on me?
{62180}{62253}- Because I've got a crazy idea you might be good at the job.|- That's crazy all right.
{62254}{62359}- I'm a salesman.|- Yeah. A peddler, a glad-hander, a back-slapper.
{62364}{62433}- You're too good to be a salesman.|- Nobody's too good to be a salesman.
{62434}{62530}Phooey. All you guys do is ring doorbells|and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.
{62536}{62608}- What's troubling you is that 50 buck cut, isn't it?|- That'd trouble anybody!
{62609}{62694}Look, Walter. The job I'm talking about|takes brains and integrity.
{62695}{62750}It takes more guts than there is in 50 salesman.
{62751}{62826}- It's the hottest job in the business.|- It's still a desk job. I don't want to be nailed to a desk.
{62827}{62896}A desk job. Is that all you can see in it?
{62897}{62970}Just a hard chair to park your pants on from nine to five.
{62971}{63067}Just a pile of papers to shuffle around, and five|sharp pencils and a scratch pad to make figures on
{63089}{63145}maybe a little doodling on the side.
{63146}{63199}That's not the way I see it, Walter.
{63199}{63255}To me a claims man is a surgeon
{63256}{63352}and that desk is an operating table, and those pencils|are scalpels and bone chisels.
{63364}{63454}And those papers are not just forms|and statistics and claims for compensation.
{63455}{63495}They're alive!
{63496}{63592}They're packed with drama!|With twisted hopes and crooked dreams.
{63594}{63691}A claims man, Walter, |is a doctor and a blood-hound and a....
{63731}{63757}Who?
{63758}{63790}Okay, hold on a minute.
{63791}{63848}A claims man is a doctor and |a blood-hound and a cop and a judge
{63849}{63910}and a jury and a father confessor, all in one.
{63911}{63967}And you want to tell me you're not interested.|You don't want to work with your brains.
{63968}{64051}All you want to work with is your finger on a doorbell. |For a few bucks more a week.
{64052}{64116}There's a dame on your phone.
{64117}{64188}- Walter Neff speaking.|- I had to call you, Walter. It's terribly urgent.
{64189}{64295}- Are you with somebody?|- Yes I am. Can't I call you back... Margie?
{64338}{64409}I've only got a minute. It can't wait.
{64410}{64476}Listen. He's going tonight. On the train.
{64477}{64573}- Are you listening? Walter!|- Yeah I'm listening, Margie.
{64575}{64627}Only uh... make it snappy will you?
{64628}{64714}He's on crutches. The doctor says he can go if he's careful.|The change will do him good.
{64715}{64788}It's wonderful, Walter. |Just the way you wanted it. On the train.
{64789}{64883}- Only with the crutches it's ever so much better, isn't it?|- Yeah!
{64885}{64946}One hundred percent better.
{64947}{65123}- Hold the line, okay? Keyes, suppose I join your office...|- It's alright. I'll wait. Only tell her not to take all day.
{65165}{65256}- Go ahead.|- It's the 10:15 from Glendale. I'm driving him.
{65257}{65353}Is it still that same dark street, isn't it?|The signal is three honks on the horn.
{65358}{65454}- Okay, anything else?|- No. Oh...
{65486}{65549}- What color did you pick?|- Blue. Navy blue.
{65550}{65634}And the cast on his left leg.
{65635}{65713}- That suits me fine.|- This is it, Walter.
{65715}{65802}I'm shaking like a leaf. |But it's straight down the line now for both of us.
{65803}{65899}I love you, Walter. Goodbye.
{65916}{65990}- Sorry, Keyes.|- What's the matter? The dames chasing you again? Or still?
{65991}{66049}- Or is it none of my business?|- If I told you it was a customer...
{66050}{66117}Margie! I bet she drinks from the bottle.
{66118}{66210}- Why don't you settle down and get married, Walter?|- Why don't you, for instance?
{66211}{66307}- I almost did, once. A long time ago.|- Now look, Keyes, I've got a call on prospect.
{66312}{66408}We even had the church picked out, the dame and I.|She had a white satin dress with flounces on it.
{66429}{66498}And I was on my way out |to the jewerly store to buy the ring.
{66499}{66595}- Then suddenly that little man in here started working on me.|- So you went back and had her investigated.
{66602}{66683}Yeah. And the stuff that came out.
{66684}{66743}She'd been dyeing her hair ever since she was sixteen.
{66744}{66839}And there was a manic-depressive in her family on |her mother's side. And she already had one husband
{66842}{66938}- ...a professional pool player in Baltimore. As for her brother...|- I get the general idea.
{66945}{67041}- She was a tramp from a long line of tramps.|- Yeah. All right. What am I to say to Norton?
{67065}{67145}- How about that job I want you for?|- I don't think I want it, Keyes.
{67146}{67223}- Thanks, just the same.|- Fair enough.
{67224}{67265}Only get this:
{67266}{67337}I picked you for the job, |not because I think you're so darn smart
{67338}{67463}but because I thought maybe you were|a shade less dumb than the rest of the outfit.
{67583}{67696}Guess I was wrong. You're not smarter,|Walter. You're just a little taller.
{67978}{68091}Yes, Keyes. Those fates I was talking about|had only been stalling me off.
{68103}{68191}Now they had thrown the switch. The gears had meshed.
{68192}{68265}The time for thinking had all run out.
{68266}{68356}I wanted my movements accounted |for up to the last possible moment.
{68357}{68453}So when I left the office I put my rate book |on the desk as if I had forgotten it.
{68458}{68541}That was part of the alibi.
{68542}{68658}From here on there was a question |of following the time table. Move by move.
{68678}{68749}I got home about seven and drove right into the garage.
{68750}{68846}This was another item to establish my alibi.
{68856}{68929}- Hiya there, Mr. Neff.|- Hello Charlie.
{68930}{69020}- How about giving the heap a wash?|- How soon you want it? I got two cars ahead of you.
{69021}{69116}- Anytime you get to it, Charlie. I'm staying in tonight.|- Okay.
{69117}{69213}Up in my apartment I called Lou Schwartz, |one of the salesmen that shared my office.
{69220}{69313}He lived in Westwood. That made it a toll call|and there'd be a record of it.
{69314}{69410}I told him I had forgotten my rate book and needed|some dope on the public liability bond I was figuring.
{69434}{69527}I changed into a navy blue suit|like Dietrichson was going to wear.
{69528}{69604}Lou Schwartz called me back |and gave me a lot of figures...
{69604}{69740}I stuffed a hand towel and a roll of adhesive tape into my|pockets so I could make it look like a cast on a broken leg...
{69764}{69860}Next I stuck a card inside the telephone box,|so that it would fall down if the bell rang.
{69882}{69968}That way I would know there had been a|phone call or visitor while I was away.
{69969}{70079}Then I did the same thing to the|doorbell in case anybody came to see me.
{70084}{70179}I left the apartment by the service stairs. Nobody saw me.
{70194}{70282}I walked all the way from |my apartment to the Dietrichson house.
{70283}{70379}I didn't want to take the bus because there was a chance|that someone might remember seeing me on it.
{70395}{70453}I was being that careful.
{70454}{70582}I could smell that honeysuckle again,|only it was even stronger, now that it was night.
{70698}{70781}I slipped the garage door open as quietly as I could.
{70782}{70855}She backed the car in, just the way I told her to.
{70856}{70952}I figured it was safer that way, in case he got|into the car before she drove it up.
{70969}{71028}I got into the back of the car.
{71028}{71095}I laid there on the floor and waited.
{71096}{71192}All the time I was thinking about that dark street|on the way to the station, when I was to do it.
{71214}{71274}and the three honks on the horn|that were to be the signal...
{71275}{71335}About ten minutes later they came down.
{71336}{71380}- You all right, honey?|- Yeah, I'm all right.
{71381}{71477}I'll have the car out in a second.
{72328}{72424}- Take it easy, honey. We've got lots of time.|- Yeah.
{72870}{72956}Remember what the doctor said. If you get careless |you might end up with a shorter leg.
{72957}{73053}So what? I could break the other one|and match them up again.
{73065}{73148}- Makes you feel pretty good to get away from me, doesn't it?|- It's only for four days.
{73149}{73244}I'll be back Monday at the latest.
{73594}{73690}This is not the right street. Why did you turn here?
{73767}{73849}What are you doing that for?
{73850}{73946}What are you honking the horn for?
{75352}{75417}- You take care of the redcap and the conductor.|- Don't worry.
{75418}{75505}- Keep them away from me as you can. I don't want help.|- I said don't worry, Walter.
{75506}{75577}You start just as soon as the train leaves.
{75578}{75637}When you get to the dairy turn off|the highway onto the dirt road.
{75638}{75700}From there it's exactly 8/10|of a mile to the dump beside the tracks.
{75701}{75795}- Remember?|- I remember everything.
{75804}{75870}You don't want any cops|stopping you with him in the back.
{75871}{75966}- Walter, we've been through all that so many times!|- When you turn off the highway, cut all your lights.
{75990}{76086}I'll be back in the observation platform. |I'll drop off as close to the spot as I can.
{76106}{76202}Let the train pass, then blink your lights twice.
{76234}{76316}- San Francisco train, lady?|- Car 9, section 11. Just my husband going.
{76317}{76413}Car 9, section 11. This way please.
{76566}{76679}- Thank you. My husband doesn't like to be helped.|- Car number 8 up there.
{76784}{76880}Car 9, section 11. Thank you.
{76931}{77023}- Here's the tickets. Take good care of yourself with that leg.|- Yeah, you take it easy driving home.
{77024}{77078}I'll miss you, honey.
{77079}{77150}Section 11, suh.
{77151}{77198}- All aboard!|- Thank you.
{77199}{77295}Good bye, honey.
{77393}{77489}Good luck, honey!
{77645}{77699}- Can you make up my berth right away?|- Yes, sir.
{77701}{77815}- I'm going back to the observation car for a smoke.|- Right this way, sir.
{78549}{78641}You'd like a chair?
{78642}{78738}No thanks, I'd rather stand.
{78743}{78839}- You going far?|- Palo Alto.
{78850}{78956}- My name's Jackson. I'm going to Medford. Medford, Oregon. |- Uh-huh.
{78959}{79021}Had a broken arm myself once.
{79022}{79152}That darn cast sure itches something fierce, don't it?|I thought I'd go crazy with mine.
{79160}{79274}- Palo Alto's a nice little town. You a Stanford man?|- I eh... used to be.
{79320}{79432}- Oh-oh.... I bet you left something behind. I always do.|- My cigar case.
{79455}{79551}- Must have left it in my overcoat back in the section.|- Would you care to roll yourself a cigarette Mr...
{79581}{79676}Dietrichson. No, thanks. I really prefer cigars.
{79708}{79804}- Maybe the porter could....|- Well, I could get it for you. Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
{79833}{79962}- Oh, if it's not too much trouble. Car 9, section 11. |- Car 9, section 11. A pleasure.
{81022}{81150}Okay. This is got to be fast. Take his hat|and pick up the crutches back in the tracks.
{81844}{81940}Okay, baby. That's it.
{83290}{83386}All right, let's go.
{83570}{83667}On the way back we went over once more what |she was to do at the inquest, if they had one
{83682}{83743}and about the insurance, when that came up.
{83743}{83840}I was afraid she might go to pieces a little,|now that we had done it, but she was perfect.
{83854}{83949}No nerves. Not a tear, not even a blink of the eyes...
{83953}{84042}She dropped me a block from my apartment house.
{84043}{84090}Walter!
{84091}{84187}What's the matter? Aren't you going to kiss me?
{84242}{84338}It's straight down the line, isn't it?
{84420}{84516}- I love you, Walter.|- I love you, baby.
{84827}{84908}It was two minutes past 11|as I went up the fire stairs again.
{84909}{84970}Nobody saw me this time either.
{84971}{85052}In the apartment I checked the bells.|The cards hadn't moved.
{85053}{85115}No calls. No visitors.
{85116}{85169}Then I changed my clothes again.
{85171}{85232}That left one last thing to do.
{85233}{85290}I had to go down to the garage.
{85290}{85386}I wanted Charlie to see me again.
{85499}{85595}- You going to use your car after all? I'm not quite through.|- Oh. It's all right, Charlie.
{85614}{85656}Just going up the drug store for something to eat.
{85657}{85770}- Working upstairs all evening. My stomach's getting sore.|- Yes, Mr. Neff.
{85816}{85865}That was all there was to it.
{85866}{85962}Nothing had slipped, nothing had been|overlooked, there was nothing to give us away.
{85991}{86078}And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down|the street to the drug store
{86079}{86162}suddenly it came over me|that everything would go wrong.
{86163}{86247}It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true so help me:
{86247}{86344}I couldn't hear my own footsteps.
{86381}{86477}It was the walk of a dead man.
{86621}{86683}That was the longest night I ever lived through, Keyes
{86685}{86776}and the next day was worse,|when the story broke in the papers
{86777}{86819}and they started talking about it at the office
{86820}{86907}and the day after that when you started digging into it.
{86908}{87001}I kept my hands in my pockets|because I... thought they were shaking
{87003}{87059}and I put on dark glasses|so people couldn't see my eyes
{87060}{87155}and then I took them off again so|people wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.
{87156}{87225}I was trying to hold myself together, but...
{87226}{87322}I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces....
{87364}{87438}- Oh, Walter.|- Hello, Keyes.
{87439}{87518}- Come along, the big boss wants to see us.|- That Dietrichson case?
{87519}{87574}- Must be.|- Anything wrong?
{87575}{87671}The guy's dead, we had him insured|and it's going to cost us dough. That's always wrong.
{87698}{87793}- What have you got so far?|- Autopsy report. No heart failure, no apoplexy...
{87794}{87843}...no predisposing medical cause of any kind.
{87844}{87891}He died of a broken neck.
{87892}{87989}- When is the inquest?|- His wife and daughter made the identification this morning.
{87995}{88090}The train people and some passengers told|how he went through to the observation car...
{88091}{88187}It was all over in 45 minutes. Verdict, accidental death.
{88218}{88314}- What do the police figure?|- That he got tangled up in his crutches and fell off the train.
{88319}{88405}They're satisfied. It's not their dough.
{88406}{88459}Come on, Walter.
{88460}{88556}All right, thank you very much, gentlemen.|I believe the legal position is now clear.
{88558}{88623}Please stand by. I may need you later.
{88624}{88720}Come in, Mr. Keyes! You too, Mr. Neff.
{88792}{88888}- You find this an uncomfortably warm day Mr. Keyes?|- Sorry, Mr. Norton. I didn't know this was formal.
{88921}{88992}Sit down, gentlemen. Any new developments?
{88993}{89064}- I just talked to this Jackson long distance, Medford, Oregon.|- Who's Jackson?
{89065}{89161}The last guy that saw Dietrichson alive.|They were out on the observation platform together talking.
{89176}{89265}Dietrichson wanted a cigar and Jackson went|to get Dietrichson's cigar case for him.
{89266}{89328}When he returned to the|observation platform, no Dietrichson.
{89329}{89418}Jackson didn't think anything was wrong until|a wire caught up with the train at Santa Barbara.
{89420}{89488}They had found Dietrichson's body|on the tracks near Burbank.
{89489}{89596}- Very interesting, about the cigar case. Anything else?|- Not much.
{89600}{89671}Dietrichson's secretary says|she didn't know anything about the policy.
{89672}{89798}There is a daughter. All she remembers is Neff talking to her|father about accident insurance at their house one night.
{89805}{89902}I couldn't sell him at first. Mrs. Dietrichson opposed it.|He said he'd think it over.
{89917}{89992}Later on I saw him in the oil fields and closed him.
{89993}{90089}- He signed the application and gave me his check.|- A fine piece of salesmanship that was, Mr. Neff.
{90106}{90191}There's no sense in pushing Neff around.|He's got the best sales record in the office.
{90192}{90275}Are your salesmen supposed to know that|the customer is going to fall off a train?
{90276}{90397}- Fall off a train? Are we sure Dietrichson fell off the train?|- I don't get it.
{90401}{90431}You don't, Mr. Keyes?
{90432}{90505}Then what do you think of this case?|This policy might cost us a great deal of money.
{90506}{90628}- It contains a double indemnity clause. What's your opinion?|- No opinion at all.
{90638}{90734}- Not even a hunch? One of those interesting hunches of yours?|- Nope. Not even a hunch.
{90746}{90837}I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes.|I've formed a very definite opinion.
{90837}{90959}- I think I know... in fact I know I know what happened.|- You know you know what?
{90959}{91056}I know it was not an accident.
{91089}{91174}- What do you say to that?|- Me?
{91175}{91249}You've got the ball. Let's see you run with it.
{91251}{91362}There's a widespread feeling|that just because a man has a large office...
{91401}{91491}Yes?... Have her come in, please.
{91492}{91547}There's a widespread feeling|that just because a man has a large office
{91548}{91601}he must be an idiot.
{91602}{91645}- I'm having a visitor, if you don't mind.|- Oh.
{91646}{91721}No, no. I want you to stay and watch me handle this.
{91722}{91818}Mrs. Dietrichson.
{91859}{91954}Thank you very much for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.|I assure you I appreciate it.
{91965}{92004}- This is Mr. Keyes.|- How do you do.
{92005}{92038}- How do you do.|- And Mr. Neff.
{92039}{92151}- I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.|- Mrs. Dietrichson, won't you sit down?
{92211}{92257}May I extend our sympathy in your bereavement.
{92258}{92380}I hesitated before asking you to come here so soon. But now|I hope you won't mind if I plunge straight into business?
{92397}{92498}- You know why we asked you to come, don't you?|- No. All I know is that the secretary made it sound very urgent.
{92500}{92589}Your husband had an accident policy with this company.|Evidently you don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{92590}{92736}- No. I remember some talk at the house but he didn't seem to want it.|- He took it out a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{92742}{92838}- You'll probably find the policy among his personal effects.|- His safe deposit box hasn't been opened yet.
{92845}{92903}It seems a tax examiner has to be present.
{92904}{92971}Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't want you to think|you are being subjected to any questioning.
{92972}{93052}- But there are a few things we should like to know.|- What sort of things?
{93053}{93141}We have the report of the coroner's inquest.|Accidental death.
{93142}{93204}We are not entirely satisfied. In fact ...
{93205}{93291}we are not satisfied at all.
{93292}{93381}Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect ...
{93382}{93478}a suicide.
{93489}{93585}- I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water?|- Please.
{93694}{93790}Thank you.
{93871}{93953}Had your husband been moody|or depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?
{93954}{94016}Did he seem to have financial|worries, for instance?
{94017}{94113}- He was all right and I don't know of any financial worries.|- Let us examine this so-called accident.
{94153}{94259}First, your husband takes out|this policy in absolute secrecy. Why?
{94262}{94345}- Because he doesn't want his family to suspect his intentions.|- What intentions?
{94346}{94417}Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone. He has to be alone.
{94418}{94544}He hobbles all the way out to the observation platform,|unlikely with his leg in a cast, unless he has a strong reason.
{94574}{94654}Once there, he finds he is not alone. There is a man there.
{94655}{94750}- What was his name, Keyes?|- His name was Jackson. Probably still is.
{94751}{94847}So he gets rid of this Jackson|with some flimsy excuse about cigars.
{94852}{94925}- And then he is alone. And then he does it. |- Does what?
{94926}{95022}He jumps. Suicide. In which case the company is not liable.
{95024}{95057}You know that, of course.
{95057}{95154}- Now we could go to court...|- I don't know anything. In fact I don't know why I came here.
{95192}{95268}Just a moment, please. I said we could|go to court. I didn't say we want to.
{95269}{95342}What I want to suggest is a compromise on both sides.
{95343}{95431}-  A settlement for a certain sum, a part of the policy value...|- Don't bother, Mr. Norton.
{95432}{95528}When I came in here I had no idea you owed me any money.|You told me you did. Then you told me you didn't.
{95538}{95655}Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is.|You want to bargain with me, at a time like this.
{95665}{95740}I don't like your insinuations|about my husband and I don't like your methods.
{95741}{95837}In fact I don't like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.
{95955}{96028}Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure carried that ball.
{96029}{96069}Only you fumbled on the goal line.
{96070}{96150}Then you heaved an illegal forward pass|and got thrown for a forty-yard loss.
{96151}{96233}- Now you can't get up cause you haven't got a leg to stand on.|- I haven't eh?
{96234}{96325}- She can go to court and we can prove it was suicide.|- Can we?
{96326}{96414}Mr. Norton, the first thing|that hit me was that suicide angle.
{96415}{96508}Only I dumped it in the|wastepaper basket just 3 seconds later.
{96509}{96609}You ought to take a look|at the statistics on suicide sometime.
{96609}{96705}- You might learn a little something about the business.|- Mr. Keyes, I was raised in the insurance business.
{96710}{96806}Yeah. In the front office. Come on, you never read|an actuarial table in your life, have you?
{96835}{96886}I've got ten volumes on suicide alone.
{96887}{96982}Suicide by race, by color, by occupation, by sex,|by seasons of the year, by time of day.
{96983}{97001}Suicide, how committed:
{97002}{97062}by poisons, by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps.
{97063}{97120}Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison
{97120}{97217}such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous,|narcotic, alkaloid, protein, and so forth.
{97234}{97296}Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places
{97297}{97393}under wheels of trains, under wheels of trucks,|under the feet of horses, from steamboats.
{97409}{97554}But Mr. Norton, there's not one single case|of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train.
{97563}{97635}And do you know how fast that train was going|at the point where the body was found?
{97635}{97674}15 miles an hour.
{97675}{97785}Now how could anybody jump off a slow moving train|like that with any kind of expectation of killing himself?
{97795}{97891}No soap, Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we'll have to pay|through the nose, and you know it.
{97917}{98013}May I have this?
{98033}{98129}Come on, Walter.
{98147}{98243}Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.
{98594}{98691}I could have hugged you right then|and there, Keyes, you and your statistics.
{98693}{98760}You were the only one we were really scared of
{98761}{98834}and instead you were almost playing on our team...
{98835}{98906}That evening when I got home my nerves had eased off.
{98907}{99003}I could feel the ground under my feet again,|and it looked like easy going from there on in.
{99020}{99162}That 100,000 bucks looked as safe for Phyllis and me|as if we had the check already deposited in the bank.
{99296}{99328}Hello...
{99329}{99378}Hello, baby....
{99378}{99424}Sure, everything is fine...
{99425}{99521}- You were wonderful in Norton's office.|- I felt so funny. I wanted to look at you all the time.
{99545}{99580}How do you think I felt, baby?
{99581}{99676}- Where are you?|- At the drug store. Just a block away.
{99677}{99780}- Can I come up?|- Okay. But be careful. Don't let anybody see you.
{100401}{100497}Hello, Keyes.
{100571}{100647}- What's on your mind?|- That broken leg.
{100649}{100701}The guy had a broken leg.
{100702}{100767}- What are you talking about?|- Talking about Dietrichson.
{100768}{100823}- He had accident insurance, didn't he? |- Yeah.
{100824}{100876}- Then he broke his leg, didn't he?|- So what?
{100876}{100976}And he didn't put in a claim.|Why didn't he put in a claim? Why?
{100979}{101077}What are you driving at?|- Walter! I had dinner two hours ago.
{101095}{101168}- It stuck half way.|- The little man is acting up again.
{101169}{101265}- There's something wrong with that Dietrichson case.|- Because he didn't file a claim?
{101281}{101401}- Maybe he just didn't have time.|- Oh maybe he just didn't know he was insured.
{101440}{101536}- No. Impossible. You delivered the policy personally, right?|- Yeah.
{101542}{101612}- And you got his check.|- Sure, I did.
{101612}{101695}- Got any bicarbonate of soda?|- No I haven't.
{101696}{101788}Walter. I've been living with this little man for 26 years.
{101789}{101915}- He's never failed me yet. There's got to be something wrong.|- Maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was suicide.
{101916}{101976}No. Not suicide.
{101977}{102029}But not accident either.
{102029}{102067}What else?
{102068}{102098}Look, Walter.
{102099}{102189}A man takes out an accident policy that is worth|a $100,000 dollars if he is killed on a train.
{102190}{102232}Then, two weeks later, he is killed on a train.
{102233}{102329}And not in a train accident, mind you,|but falling off some silly observation car.
{102331}{102396}Do you know what|the mathematical probability of that is?
{102397}{102487}One out of.... I don't know how many billions.
{102488}{102537}And add to that the broken leg.
{102538}{102645}Now it just can't be the way it looks.|Something has been worked on us.
{102698}{102794}Such as what?
{102900}{102941}Murder?
{102942}{103013}- Don't you have any peppermint or anything?|- I'm sorry.
{103014}{103101}- Soda water?|- No, no, no.
{103102}{103197}- Who do you suspect?|- Maybe I like to make it easy, but I always suspect the beneficiary.
{103226}{103321}- The wife? |- That wide-eyed dame that didn't know anything about anything.
{103322}{103393}- You're crazy, Keyes. She wasn't even on the train.|- I know she wasn't, Walter.
{103394}{103490}I don't claim to know how it was worked,|or who worked it, but I know that it was worked.
{103507}{103602}I've got to get to a drug store.|It feels like a hunk of concrete inside me.
{103615}{103688}- Good night, Walter.|- Good night, Keyes.
{103689}{103785}- See you at the office in the morning.|- Yeah.
{103790}{103851}But I'd like to move in on her right now, tonight
{103852}{103948}if it wasn't for Norton and his|stripe-pants ideas about company policy.
{103950}{104021}I'd have the cops after her so quick her head would spin.
{104022}{104118}They'd put her through the wringer,|and, brother, what they would squeeze out.
{104135}{104203}- Only you haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.|- Not too much.
{104204}{104342}Just 26 years experience, all the percentage there is,|and this lump of concrete in my stomach.
{104394}{104490}Have you got one of those things?
{104702}{104797}- Good night, Keyes.|- So long, Walter.
{105084}{105179}- How much does he know?|- He doesn't know anything.
{105180}{105237}It's those stinking hunches of his.
{105239}{105391}- But he can't prove anything, can he?|- Not if we're careful. Not if we don't see each other for a while.
{105406}{105474}- For how long a while?|- Until all this dies down.
{105475}{105557}You don't know Keyes. Once he gets his|teeth into something he never lets go.
{105558}{105654}He'll investigate you. He'll have you shadowed.|He'll watch you every minute from now on.
{105661}{105743}- Are you afraid, baby?|- Yes, I'm afraid.
{105744}{105815}But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us.
{105816}{105856}We're not the same any more.
{105857}{105937}We did it so we could be together, but instead|of that it's pulling us apart. Isn't it?
{105938}{106072}- What are you talking about?|- And you don't really care whether we see each other or not.
{106087}{106182}Shut up, baby.
{106344}{106402}Hello, Mr. Neff.
{106403}{106494}- Hello.|- Lola Dietrichson. Don't you remember me?
{106495}{106579}- Yes. Of course.|- Could I talk to you, just for a few minutes?
{106580}{106647}Somewhere where we can be alone?
{106648}{106743}Oh Yeah uh... Come on into my office.
{106852}{106948}- Is it something about... what happened?|- Yes, Mr. Neff.
{106963}{107024}It's about my father's death.
{107025}{107121}I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.
{107157}{107287}- Lou, do you mind if I use the office alone for a few minutes?|- It's all yours, Walter.
{107425}{107527}Look at me Mr. Neff, I'm not crazy,|not hysterical, not even crying
{107576}{107664}but I have an awful feeling that something's wrong.
{107665}{107722}And I had that same feeling once before.
{107723}{107779}- When my mother died.|- When your mother died?
{107780}{107876}We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago.|We had a cabin there. It was winter and very cold
{107915}{107978}and my mother was very sick with pneumonia.
{107979}{108020}She had a nurse with her.
{108022}{108099}There were just the three of us in the cabin.
{108099}{108195}One night I got up and went into my mother's room.|She was delirious with fever.
{108212}{108302}All the bed covers were on the floor|and the windows were wide open.
{108303}{108386}The nurse wasn't in the room.|I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could.
{108386}{108467}Just then I heard a door open behind me.
{108468}{108523}The nurse stood there.
{108524}{108637}She didn't say a word, but there was|a look in her eyes I'll never forget.
{108706}{108802}Two days later my mother was dead.
{108859}{108937}- Do you know who that nurse was?|- No. Who?
{108938}{109034}Phyllis! I tried to tell my father,|but I was just a kid then and he wouldn't listen to me.
{109065}{109201}Six months later she married him and I kind of talked myself|out of the idea that she could have done anything like that.
{109212}{109308}But now it's all back again, now that|something has happened to my father, too.
{109327}{109383}You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson.
{109384}{109422}- Your father fell off a train.|- Yes...
{109423}{109494}and two days before he fell off|that train what was Phyllis doing?
{109495}{109586}She was in her room in front of a mirror,|with a black hat on, and she was pinning a black veil to it
{109587}{109669}as if she couldn't wait|to see how she would look in mourning.
{109670}{109724}You've had a pretty bad shock, Miss Dietrichson.
{109725}{109817}- Aren't you just imagining all this?|- I caught her eyes in the mirror and they had that look in them...
{109818}{109914}....they had before my mother died. That same look.
{109927}{109971}You don't like your step-mother, do you?
{109972}{110053}- Isn't it just because she is your step-mother? |- I loathe her. Because she did it.
{110054}{110128}She did it for the money. Only you're not going|to pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?
{110129}{110203}She's not going to get away with it|this time. I'm going to speak up.
{110204}{110287}- I'm going to tell everything I know.|- You'd better be careful, saying things like that.
{110288}{110384}I'm not afraid. You'll see.
{110552}{110648}I'm sorry.
{110666}{110752}I didn't mean to act like this.
{110753}{110849}- All this that you've been telling me... who else have you told?|- No one.
{110855}{110928}- How about your step-mother?|- Of course not.
{110929}{111025}I moved out. I'm not living at home any more.
{111059}{111209}- And you didn't tell that boy-friend of yours? Zachetti.|- I'm not seeing him any more. We had a fight.
{111231}{111344}- Where are you living now?|- I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood.
{111346}{111453}- Four walls, and you just sit and look at them, huh?|- Yes, Mr. Neff.
{111550}{111666}So I took her to dinner that evening at a Mexican restaurant|down on Olvera Street where nobody would see us.
{111676}{111730}I wanted to cheer her up..
{111731}{111815}Next day was Sunday and we went|for a ride down to the beach.
{111816}{111892}She had loosened up a bit and she was even laughing...
{111893}{111973}I had to make sure she wouldn't tell|that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.
{111974}{112047}It was dynamite, whether it was true or not.
{112048}{112144}And I had no chance to talk to Phyllis.|You were watching her like a hawk, Keyes.
{112146}{112242}I couldn't even phone her for|fear you had the wires tapped.
{112255}{112351}Monday morning there was a note|on my desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.
{112353}{112453}For a minute I wondered if|it could be about Lola. It was worse.
{112476}{112576}Outside your door was the last guy|in the world I wanted to see.
{112797}{112873}Come in. Come in, Walter.
{112874}{112918}Hello, Keyes.
{112919}{112964}I want to ask you something.
{112965}{113043}After all the years we've known each other,|do you mind if I make a rather blunt statement?
{113044}{113101}- About what?|- About me.
{113102}{113196}Walter, I'm a very great man. This Dietrichson business.
{113202}{113283}It's murder, and murders don't come any neater.
{113284}{113350}As fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into.
{113351}{113471}Smart and tricky and almost perfect, but... |I think Papa has it all figured out
{113492}{113589}- ...and wrapped up in tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.|- Go ahead, I'm listening.
{113613}{113654}You know what?
{113655}{113751}That guy Dietrichson was never on the train.
{113754}{113837}- He wasn't?|- No, he wasn't.
{113838}{113963}Now look Walter, you can't be sure of killing a man|by throwing him off a train that's going 15 miles an hour.
{113972}{114068}The only way you can be sure is to kill him first|and then throw his body on the tracks.
{114085}{114134}That would mean either killing him on the train...
{114135}{114206}or... and this is where it really gets fancy...
{114207}{114256}you kill him somewhere else and put him on the tracks.
{114257}{114353}Two possibilities, and I personally buy the second.
{114371}{114453}- You're way ahead of me, Keyes.|- Look, Walter, it was like this.
{114454}{114550}They killed the guy... the wife and somebody else...
{114559}{114633}and then the somebody else took the crutches|and went on the train as Dietrichson
{114634}{114673}and then the somebody else jumped off
{114674}{114737}and then they put the body on the tracks|where the train had passed.
{114738}{114786}An impersonation, see.
{114786}{114822}And a cinch to work.
{114823}{114909}Because it was night, very few people were about,|they had the crutches to stare at
{114910}{115015}- ...and they never really looked at the man at all.|- It's fancy all right, Keyes. Maybe it's a little too fancy.
{115024}{115120}Is it? I tell you it fits together like a watch.
{115133}{115183}And now let's see what we have in the way of proof.
{115184}{115280}The only guy that really got a good look at this|supposed Dietrichson is sitting right outside my office.
{115295}{115391}I took the trouble to bring him down here from Oregon.
{115423}{115491}- Come in, Mr. Jackson.|- Yes sir, Mr. Keyes.
{115493}{115549}- These are fine cigars you smoke.|- Two for a quarter.
{115550}{115641}- That's what I said. Did you study those photographs? |- Yes, indeed.
{115642}{115707}- I studied them thoroughly. Very thoroughly.|- Did you make up your mind?
{115708}{115755}Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.
{115756}{115852}- Up in Medford we take our time making up our minds...|- Well, you're not in Medford now. We're in a hurry.
{115862}{115945}- Let's have it.|- Are these photographs of the late Mr. Dietrichson?
{115946}{116015}- Yes.|- Then my answer is no.
{116016}{116089}- What do you mean no?|- I mean this is not the man that was on the train.
{116090}{116166}- Will you swear to that?|- I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.
{116167}{116272}- And if I say it, I mean it, and if I mean it, of course I'll swear it.|- There you are, Walter. There's your proof.
{116279}{116362}- Oh, this is Mr. Neff, one of our salesmen.|- Please to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased indeed.
{116363}{116410}- How are you?|- Very fine, thank you. Never was better.
{116411}{116451}Sit down, Mr. Jackson.
{116452}{116600}- How would you describe the man you saw on that platform?|- Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger man
{116603}{116676}about 10 or 15 years younger|than the man in these photographs.
{116677}{116773}- Dietrichson was about 50, wasn't he, Walter?|- 51, according to the policy.
{116780}{116851}The man I saw was nothing like 51 years old.
{116852}{116916}Of course, it was pretty dark on that platform
{116917}{116976}come to think of it, he tried to keep his back towards me.
{116977}{117048}- But I'm positive just the same.|- Thank you, Jackson.
{117049}{117096}Of course you understand|this matter is strictly confidential.
{117097}{117233}- We may need you again here if the case comes to court.|- Any time you need me, I'm at your entire disposal.
{117241}{117281}Expenses paid, of course.
{117282}{117360}Of course.
{117361}{117441}Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.
{117442}{117489}Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.
{117490}{117586}Listen, I'm sending a man named|Jackson to you with an expense account.
{117590}{117687}Oh, we brought him down here from Medford Oregon ....
{117704}{117736}Uh-huh.
{117737}{117791}Oh, take care of his hotel, will you?
{117792}{117888}- Ever been in Medford, Mr. Neff?|- Never been up there.
{117891}{118002}- Do you go trout fishing? Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way?|- Nope.
{118010}{118074}I don't fish.
{118075}{118124}Neff. Neff. It's the name.
{118125}{118201}- There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis.|- No relation.
{118203}{118253}Let me see. This man's an automobile dealer in Corvallis.
{118254}{118347}- Very reputable man, too, I'm told.|- All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you go down to the cashier's...
{118349}{118405}Room 27 on the 11th floor.|They'll take care of your expense account
{118406}{118475}- ....and the ticket for the train tonight.|- Tonight?
{118476}{118523}Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
{118524}{118703}- There's a very good osteopath here I want to see before I leave.|- Osteopath? Well, just don't put her on the expense account.
{118746}{118843}- Well, goodbye, gentlemen. It's been a pleasure.|- Goodbye.
{118889}{118985}There it is, Walter. It's beginning|to come apart at the seams already.
{118991}{119058}A murder's never perfect.|It always comes apart sooner or later.
{119059}{119117}And when two people are involved it's usually sooner.
{119118}{119201}We know the Dietrichson dame is in it, and somebody else.
{119202}{119266}Pretty soon we're going to know who that somebody else is.|He'll show. He's got to show.
{119267}{119342}Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet.|Their emotions are all kicked up.
{119343}{119427}Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.|They can't keep away from each other.
{119428}{119491}They think it's twice as safe|because there are two of them.
{119492}{119580}But it's not twice as safe.|It's ten times twice as dangerous.
{119581}{119653}They've committed a murder and that's|not like taking a trolley ride together
{119653}{119718}where each one can get off at a different stop.|They're stuck with each other.
{119719}{119844}They've got to ride all the way to the end of the line.|It's a one-way trip and the last stop is the cemetery.
{119852}{119953}She put in her claim|and I'm going to throw it right back at her.
{120099}{120177}Let her sue us if she dares.|I'll be ready for her...
{120179}{120274}and that somebody else.|They'll be digging their own graves.
{120474}{120557}Mrs. Dietrichson?... This is Jerry's market.
{120558}{120654}We just got in a shipment of that English soap|you were asking about. Will you be coming by the day?
{120675}{120771}Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.
{121356}{121408}Hello, Walter.
{121409}{121505}Come over here.
{121507}{121603}- What's the matter?|- Everything's the matter.
{121625}{121674}Keyes is rejecting your claim.
{121675}{121734}He's sitting back with his mouth watering,|waiting for you to sue.
{121735}{121794}- He wants you to sue. But you're not going to.|- What's he got to stop me?
{121795}{121891}He's got plenty.
{121920}{121993}He's figured out how it was worked.|He knows it was somebody else on the train.
{121994}{122086}- He's dug up a witness he thinks will prove it.|- Prove it how? If he rejects that claim, I have to sue.
{122087}{122177}Yeah? And then you're in court and|a lot of other things are going to come up.
{122178}{122271}Like, for instance, about you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.
{122272}{122338}- What about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson?|- The way she died.
{122339}{122417}And about that black hat you were|trying on before you needed a black hat.
{122418}{122484}Lola's been telling you some of her|cockeyed stories. She's been seeing you.
{122485}{122561}I've been seeing her, if you want to know.|So she won't yell her head off about what she knows.
{122562}{122648}- She's been putting on an act, crying all over your shoulder...|- Keep her out of it.
{122648}{122744}- All I'm telling you is we're not going to sue.|- Because you don't want the money, even if you could get it?
{122745}{122820}- Because she's made you feel like a heel all of sudden.|- It isn't the money any more.  It's our necks now.
{122821}{122887}- We're pulling out, understand.|- Because of what Keyes can do?
{122888}{122984}You're not fooling me, Walter.|It's because of Lola. What you did to her father.
{122986}{123122}- You can't take it that she might find out some day. Can you?|- I said, leave her out of it.
{123226}{123319}- It's me I'm talking about. I don't want to be left out of it.|- Stop saying that. It's just that it hasn't worked out
{123320}{123395}- ...the way we wanted. We can't go though with it. That's all.|- We have gone through with it, Walter.
{123396}{123492}The tough part is all behind us. We just have|to hold on now and not go soft inside
{123497}{123601}- ...and stick together, close, the way we started out.|- Watch it.
{124025}{124084}I loved you, Walter. And I hated him.
{124086}{124170}But I wasn't going to do anything|about it, not until I met you.
{124171}{124267}You planned the whole thing.|I only wanted him dead.
{124269}{124331}Yeah, and I was the one|that fixed him so he was dead.
{124332}{124379}Is that what you're telling me?
{124380}{124430}And nobody's pulling out.
{124431}{124556}We went into it together, and we're coming out at the end|together. It's straight down the line for both of us
{124566}{124662}Remember?
{124744}{124812}Yes, I remembered.
{124813}{124897}Just like I remembered what you had told me, Keyes...
{124898}{124967}about that trolley car ride...
{124968}{125053}and how there was no way to getting off|until the end of the line...
{125053}{125134}where the cementary was.
{125136}{125230}And I got to thinking what cemeteries are for.
{125231}{125322}They're to put dead people in,
{125323}{125449}I guess that was the first time I ever|thought about Phyllis that way. Dead, I mean...
{125479}{125568}and how it would be if she was dead.
{125569}{125655}I saw Lola 3 or 4 times that week.
{125656}{125756}One night we went up into|the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl...
{125757}{125897}I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, but it was|only with her that I could relax and let go a little.
{126601}{126693}Why are you crying?
{126694}{126755}You won't tell me?
{126756}{126799}Of course I will, Walter.
{126800}{126896}I wouldn't tell anybody else but you. It's about Nino.
{126910}{126993}- Zachetti? What about him?|- They killed my father together.
{126994}{127090}He and Phyllis. He helped her do it. I know he did.
{127099}{127156}What makes you say that?
{127157}{127236}I've been following him.|He's been to her house, night after night.
{127237}{127295}It was Phyllis and him all alone.
{127296}{127362}Maybe he was going with me just for a blind.
{127363}{127439}- And the night of the murder...|- You promised not to talk that way any more.
{127440}{127528}...he was supposed to pick me up after a lecture at U.C.L.A.
{127529}{127619}but he never showed up. He said he was sick.
{127620}{127705}Sick!
{127706}{127755}He couldn't show up,
{127756}{127852}because the train was leaving with my father on it.
{127941}{128037}Maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe it's all just in my mind.
{128045}{128141}- Sure, it's all in your mind.|- I only wish it were, Walter
{128167}{128263}...because I still love him.
{128361}{128395}Zachetti.
{128396}{128465}Phyllis and Zachetti.
{128466}{128535}What was he doing up at her house?
{128536}{128605}I couldn't figure that one out.
{128606}{128688}I tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere.
{128689}{128773}But the real brain-twister came the next day.
{128774}{128839}You sprang it on me, Keyes....
{128840}{128924}after office hours, when you caught|me down in the lobby of the building.
{128925}{129021}Oh, Walter, just a minute.
{129085}{129158}- Hello, Keyes.|- Just hang onto your hat, Walter.
{129159}{129268}- What for?|- Nothing much. The Dietrichson case just busted wide open.
{129289}{129384}- How do you mean?|- The guy showed. That's how.
{129385}{129444}- What guy?|- The guy who helped to do it.
{129445}{129509}- The somebody else?|- Mm-hmm.
{129510}{129573}- No kidding?|- Yeah, she's filed suit against us
{129574}{129610}and it's okay by me.
{129611}{129689}When we get into that courtroom|I'll tear them to pieces - both of them.
{129690}{129743}- Come on - I'll buy you a martini.|- No thanks, Keyes.
{129744}{129817}- With two olives.|- I've got to get a shave and a shoeshine. I've got a date.
{129818}{129914}Margie. I still bet she drinks from the bottle.
{129922}{130028}- They give matches when you buy cigars. Just ask for them.|- I don't like them. They always explode in my pockets.
{130030}{130126}So long, Walter.
{130187}{130245}I was scared stiff, Keyes.
{130246}{130312}Maybe you were playing cat-and-mouse with me.
{130313}{130398}Maybe you knew all along I was the somebody else.
{130399}{130451}That's what I had to find out
{130452}{130548}and I knew where to look... in your office.
{131279}{131329}Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential.
{131330}{131372}Dietrichson File.
{131373}{131441}With regard to your proposal|to put Walter Neff under surveillance
{131442}{131492}I disagree absolutely.
{131493}{131644}I have investigated his movements on the night of the crime|and he is definitely placed in his apartment from 7:15 PM on.
{131651}{131823}In addition to this, I have known Neff intimately for 11 years,|and I personally vouch for him, without reservation...
{131949}{132074}...Furthermore, no connection whatsoever has been established|between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson
{132083}{132178}whereas I am now able to report that such a connection|has been established between her and another man.
{132231}{132383}This man has been observed to visit Mrs. Dietrichson|on the night of July 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.
{132399}{132494}We have succeeded in identifying him as one Nino Zachetti
{132495}{132549}former medical student, aged 28
{132550}{132647}residing at|Lilac Court Apartments 12281/2 N. La Brea Avenue.
{132689}{132778}We have checked Zachetti's|movements on the night of the crime
{132779}{132857}and have found that they cannot be accounted for.
{132858}{132935}I am preparing a more detailed|report for your consideration
{132936}{133032}and it is my belief that we already have|sufficient evidence against Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson
{133055}{133108}to justify police action.
{133109}{133205}I strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over|to the office of the District Attorney.
{133225}{133321}Respectfully, Barton Keyes.
{134142}{134204}Phyllis? Walter.
{134205}{134269}I've got to see you... Tonight...
{134270}{134335}Yes, it has to be tonight...
{134336}{134394}How's eleven o'clock?
{134395}{134437}Don't worry about Keyes.
{134438}{134511}Leave the door on the latch and put the lights out.
{134512}{134593}No, nobody's watching the house... not any more.
{134594}{134652}It's just for the neighbors...
{134653}{134717}I told you not to worry about Keyes.
{134718}{134774}See you eleven o'clock.
{134775}{134828}Yeah.
{134829}{134924}Goodbye, baby.
{134958}{135054}I guess I don't have to tell you|what I intended to do at eleven o'clock, Keyes.
{135068}{135154}For the first time I saw a way|to get clear of the whole mess I was in
{135155}{135235}and of Phyllis, too, all at the same time.
{135236}{135298}Yeah, that's what I thought.
{135299}{135395}But what I didn't know was that she had plans of her own.
{136802}{136898}In here, Walter.
{137203}{137285}Hello, baby.
{137286}{137382}- Anybody else in the house?|- Nobody. Why?
{137395}{137491}- What's that music?|- A radio up the street.
{137664}{137731}Just like the first time I came here, isn't it?
{137733}{137811}We were talking about automobile insurance.
{137812}{137897}Only you were thinking about murder.
{137898}{137993}- And I was thinking about that anklet.|- And what are you thinking about now?
{137994}{138128}- I'm all through thinking, baby. Just came to say goodbye.|- Goodbye? Where are you going?
{138155}{138218}You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.
{138219}{138330}- I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.|- Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is.
{138339}{138387}All right, I tell you.
{138387}{138447}A friend of mine has got a funny theory.
{138448}{138540}He says when two people commit a murder|it's sort of like a riding a trolley car together -
{138541}{138606}one can't get off without the other.|They're stuck with each other.
{138607}{138683}They have to go on riding clear to the end of the line.
{138685}{138774}- And the last stop is the cemetery.|- Maybe he's got something there.
{138775}{138818}You bet he has.
{138819}{138883}Two people are going to ride|to the end of the line, all right.
{138884}{138980}Only I'm not going to be one of them.|I've got another guy to finish my ride for me.
{138990}{139107}- Just who are you talking about?|- An acquaintance of yours. A Mr. Zachetti.
{139131}{139227}Come on, baby, I just got into this because|I knew a little something about insurance, didn't I?
{139229}{139260}I was a sucker.
{139261}{139355}- I'd have been brushed-off as soon as you got the money.|- Nobody wanted to brush you off.
{139356}{139481}- Save it. I'm telling it's been you and that Zachetti all along.|- That's not true.
{139484}{139579}It doesn't make any difference whether it's true or not.
{139586}{139677}The point is Keyes believes Zachetti|is the guy he's been looking for.
{139678}{139794}- He'll have him in the gas chamber before he knows what happened.|- And what's happening to me all this time?
{139804}{139901}Don't be silly, baby.
{139952}{140049}What do you think is going to happen to you?|You helped him do the murder, didn't you?
{140059}{140142}That's what Keyes thinks. And what's good enough|for Keyes is good enough for me.
{140143}{140239}Maybe it's not good enough for me, Walter.|Maybe I don't go for the idea.
{140251}{140347}- Maybe I'd rather talk.|- Sometimes people are where they can't talk.
{140354}{140419}Under six feet of dirt, maybe.
{140419}{140511}And if it was you, they'd just charge it up|to Zachetti, wouldn't they?
{140512}{140566}Sure they would.
{140567}{140664}That's just what's going to happen, baby.|Because he's coming here, tonight... in about 15 minutes.
{140678}{140727}With the cops right behind him.
{140728}{140794}It's all taken care of.
{140795}{140876}- And that'd make everything lovely for you, wouldn't it?|- Right.
{140877}{140938}And it's got to be done before|that suit of yours comes to trial
{140939}{141030}and Lola gets a chance to sound off and they trip|you up on the stand and you start to fold up
{141031}{141099}- ...and drag me down with you.|- Maybe I had Zachetti here so they won't get a chance to trip me up.
{141100}{141192}- So we can get that money and be together.|- That's cute. Say it again.
{141193}{141281}He came here the first time just to ask where Lola was.|I made him come back. I was working on him.
{141282}{141331}He's crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered.
{141332}{141469}I kept hammering into him that she was with another, so he'd|get into his jealous rage and then I'd tell him where she was.
{141490}{141586}- And you know what he'd have done to her, don't you, Walter?|- Yeah.
{141594}{141679}And for once I believe you.|Because it's just rotten enough.
{141680}{141766}- We're both rotten.|- Only you're just a little more rotten.
{141767}{141854}You got me to take care of your husband|for you and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola
{141855}{141902}and maybe take care of me too
{141903}{141976}and then somebody else would have come|along to take care of Zachetti for you.
{141977}{142135}- That's the way you operate isn't it, baby?|- Suppose it is. Is what you've cooked up for tonight any better?
{142138}{142202}I don't like this music anymore.
{142203}{142299}Do you mind if I close the window?
{142721}{142796}You can do better than that, can't you baby?
{142796}{142892}Better try again!
{142903}{142998}Maybe if I came a little closer?
{143213}{143309}How's this? Do you think you can do it now?
{143486}{143582}Why didn't you shoot again, baby?
{143683}{143779}Don't tell me it's because you've been|in love with me all this time.
{143781}{143869}No. I never loved you, Walter.|Not you, or anybody else.
{143870}{143948}I'm rotten to the heart.|I used you, just as you said.
{143949}{144034}That's all you ever meant to me....
{144035}{144100}...until a minute ago.
{144101}{144198}When I couldn't fire that second shot.
{144208}{144293}I didn't think anything like that could ever happen to me.
{144294}{144417}- I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.|- I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold me close.
{144555}{144651}Goodbye, baby.
{145893}{145987}Zachetti!
{145988}{146084}Come here!
{146152}{146248}I said come here.
{146259}{146368}- The name is Neff.|- Yeah? And I still don't like it. What do you want?
{146373}{146469}Look, kid, I want to give you a present.
{146483}{146540}- Here's a nice new nickel.|- What's the gag?
{146541}{146648}- Suppose you go back down the hill to a store and make a call.|- Keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice cream cone.
{146658}{146794}Number Granite 0386. Ask for Miss Dietrichson, first name Lola.|- She isn't worth a nickel.
{146804}{146930}- And if I ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone.|- Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel and call her. She wants you to.
{146927}{147023}- She doesn't want any part of me.|- I know who told you that, and it's not true.
{147045}{147141}She's in love with you. Always has been.|Don't ask me why. I couldn't even guess.
{147154}{147249}Here. Granite 0386, go on and call her.
{147250}{147346}Go on! That way.
{147540}{147622}It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.
{147623}{147696}It's cold.
{147697}{147784}I wonder if she's still|lying there alone in that house
{147785}{147876}or whether they've found her by now.
{147877}{147973}I wonder a lot of things, but they don't matter any more
{148058}{148149}except I want to ask you to do me a favor.
{148150}{148274}I want you to be the one to tell Lola,|kind of gently, before it breaks wide open...
{148306}{148402}I want you to take care of her and that guy Zachetti
{148508}{148604}so he doesn't get pushed around too much.
{148616}{148711}Hello, Keyes.
{148903}{148984}Up pretty early, aren't you?
{148985}{149081}I always wondered what time you got down to the office.
{149082}{149156}Or did your little man pull you out of bed?
{149156}{149214}The janitor did.
{149215}{149311}Seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here.
{149320}{149415}Wouldn't be surprised.
{149416}{149529}- I wanted to straighten out that Dietrichson story for you.|- So I gather.
{149565}{149658}- How long have you been standing there?|- Long enough.
{149659}{149779}Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it.|One you didn't quite figure out.
{149798}{149869}You can't figure them all, Walter.
{149870}{149966}That's right. You can't, can you?
{149970}{150051}And now I suppose I get the big speech
{150052}{150148}the one with all the two-dollar words in it.
{150152}{150223}Let's have it, Keyes.
{150224}{150320}Walter, you're all washed up.
{150363}{150457}Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.
{150458}{150554}I'm going to call a doctor.
{150560}{150649}What for? So they can patch me up?
{150650}{150721}So they can nurse me along till I'm back on my feet?
{150722}{150795}So I can walk under my own power|into that gas chamber up in San Quentin?
{150796}{150892}- Is that it, Keyes?|- Something like that, Walter.
{150897}{150959}- Well, I've got a different idea.|- Yeah?
{150960}{151096}Look, Keyes. Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find|these cylinders till tomorrow morning, when the office opens.
{151117}{151180}From then on you can play it any way you like.
{151181}{151258}Would you do that much for me, Keyes?
{151259}{151345}- Give me one good reason.|- I need four hours to get where I'm going.
{151346}{151441}- You're not going anywhere, Walter.|- You bet I am.
{151442}{151468}I'm going across the border.
{151469}{151557}- You haven't got a chance, Walter.|- Good enough to try for.
{151558}{151654}- You'll never make the border.|- That's what you think.
{151657}{151704}Watch me.
{151705}{151760}You'll never even make the elevator.
{151761}{151857}So long, Keyes.
{152495}{152531}Hello...
{152532}{152628}Send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street...
{152633}{152728}Yeah... It's a police job.
{153165}{153261}- How you doing, Walter?|- I'm fine.
{153280}{153375}Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away.
{153376}{153472}They're on the way.
{153524}{153586}You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes?
{153587}{153636}Let me tell you.
{153637}{153718}The guy you were looking for was too close.
{153719}{153787}He was right across the desk from you.
{153788}{153884}Closer than that, Walter.
{153930}{154026}I love you too.
