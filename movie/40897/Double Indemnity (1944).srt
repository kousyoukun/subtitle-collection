1
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:25,240
Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.

2
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:40,991
- Working pretty late, aren't you, Mr. Neff?
- Late enough. Let's ride.

3
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,989
- You look kind of all in, at that.
- I'm fine.

4
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:50,387
- How is the insurance business, Mr. Neff?
- Okay.

5
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:52,945
They wouldn't ever
sell me any.

6
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:54,665
They said I have something
loose in my heart.

7
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:58,103
- I say it's rheumatism.
- Yeah?

8
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:00,142
Twelve.

9
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:52,727
Office memorandum.

10
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:56,565
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

11
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,924
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

12
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,242
Dear Keyes...

13
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:07,640
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

14
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,998
Well, I don't like
the word confession.

15
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:12,077
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

16
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:13,796
because it was smack up
against your nose.

17
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,915
You think you're such a hot
potato as a Claims Manager...

18
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:19,114
such a wolf on a phony claim.

19
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,912
Maybe you are, but let's take a
look at that Dietrichson claim.

20
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,150
Accident and double indemnity.

21
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:31,028
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

22
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:33,827
You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

23
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:36,545
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

24
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:40,383
You said it was murder. Check.

25
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,860
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

26
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,979
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

27
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:49,538
It was perfect.

28
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:52,976
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

29
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:54,895
just one little mistake.

30
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,693
When it came to picking the
killer, you picked the wrong guy.

31
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:03,212
You want to know who
killed Dietrichson?

32
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:06,769
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

33
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:09,648
I killed Dietrichson.

34
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:12,486
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

35
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:15,565
35 years old, unmarried,
no visible scars...

36
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,642
until a while ago, that is.

37
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,641
Yes, I killed him.

38
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,239
I killed him for money...

39
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:27,839
and for a woman.

40
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:33,555
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

41
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:37,233
Pretty, isn't it?

42
00:06:50,507 --> 00:06:52,306
It all began last May.

43
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,665
Around the end of May, it was.

44
00:06:56,743 --> 00:07:00,701
<i>I'd been out to Glendale to deliver
a policy on some dairy trucks.</i>

45
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:04,140
<i>On the way back I remembered this
auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.</i>

46
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,059
<i>So I drove over there.</i>

47
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,017
<i>It was one of those
California Spanish houses...</i>

48
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,855
<i>everyone was nuts about
10 or 15 years ago.</i>

49
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,214
<i>This one must've cost somebody
about $30,000.</i>

50
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:16,653
<i>That is, if he ever
finished paying for it.</i>

51
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:20,851
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

52
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:23,329
- Who wants to see him?
- My name is Neff. Walter Neff.

53
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,527
- If you're selling something...
- Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...

54
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:27,687
and it's not
magazine subscriptions.

55
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:30,046
- Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in.
- How soon do you expect him?

56
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:32,244
He'll be home when he gets
here, if that's any help to you.

57
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:33,963
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

58
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,763
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

59
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:37,842
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.
What is it?

60
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,880
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?

61
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,799
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

62
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,918
- Pacific all what?
- The Pacific All Risk Insurance Company.

63
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,876
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

64
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:49,396
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

65
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:52,514
- but he's never in his office.
- Is there anything I can do?

66
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:54,033
The insurance ran out
on the 15th.

67
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:56,152
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

68
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,751
or something
while you're not...

69
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:59,031
fully covered.

70
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,389
Perhaps I know
what you mean, Mr. Neff.

71
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:06,106
- I've just been taking a sunbath.
- No pigeons around, I hope.

72
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:10,064
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

73
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:11,424
Oh, that's all right.

74
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:13,903
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

75
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:16,741
Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

76
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,579
Where would
the living room be?

77
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,978
In there, but they keep
the liquor locked up.

78
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,936
It's all right.
I always carry my own keys.

79
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,611
<i>The living
room was still stuffy...</i>

80
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:36,251
<i>from last night's cigars.</i>

81
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,210
<i>The windows were closed...</i>

82
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,209
<i>and the sunshine coming in
through the venetian blinds...</i>

83
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,447
<i>showed up the dust in the air.</i>

84
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:47,205
<i>On the piano, in a couple of fancy
frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

85
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,404
<i>his daughter
by his first wife.</i>

86
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:52,762
<i>They had a bowl of those
little red goldfish...</i>

87
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:55,161
<i>on the table behind
the big davenport.</i>

88
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,520
<i>But to tell you
the truth, Keyes...</i>

89
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,479
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.</i>

90
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,356
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.
Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.</i>

91
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:07,155
<i>I was thinking about that dame upstairs,
and the way she had looked at me...</i>

92
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,833
<i>and I wanted
to see her again, close...</i>

93
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:12,512
<i>without that silly staircase
between us.</i>

94
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:19,909
- I wasn't long, was I?
- Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

95
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:23,306
- Hope I've got my face on straight.
- It's perfect, for my money.

96
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:24,786
- Neff is the name, isn't it?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:27,024
With two "F's," like in
Philadelphia, if you know the story.

98
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:29,544
<i>What story?
The Philadelphia Story.</i>

99
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:31,702
Suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance.

100
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:34,180
My husband never
tells me anything.

101
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,458
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

102
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,737
We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

103
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,256
and we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

104
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:48,293
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

105
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,892
As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

106
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,651
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

107
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:56,129
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

108
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,288
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

109
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,207
I suppose so. But he's
never home much before 8:00.

110
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,566
That's fine with me.

111
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:03,565
You're not connected with
the Automobile Club, are you?

112
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,964
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

113
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:08,841
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

114
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:11,641
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.

115
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,721
No, he isn't.

116
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,839
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

117
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,476
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

118
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:22,356
The Automobile Club's fine. I can
do just as well for you, though.

119
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,514
I have a very attractive
policy here.

120
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:27,152
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

121
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,672
For instance, we're writing a new
kind of 50% retention feature...

122
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,711
in the collision coverage.

123
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,549
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

124
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:37,068
Well, I've been at it 11
years. Doing pretty well?

125
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:38,467
It's a living.

126
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:42,584
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

127
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:45,943
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

128
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:48,342
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

129
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:49,701
Accident insurance?

130
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,900
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

131
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,817
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

132
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,655
- \just my name.
- As, for instance?

133
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,814
- Phyllis.
- Phyllis, huh?

134
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:06,172
- I think I like that.
- But you're not sure?

135
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,251
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

136
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,969
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop
by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

137
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,809
- He'll be in then.
- Who?

138
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:16,967
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

139
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:19,845
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

140
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:21,204
if you know what I mean.

141
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:24,563
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

142
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,761
- How fast was I going, officer?
- I'd say around 90.

143
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,360
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

144
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,559
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

145
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,277
Suppose it doesn't take.

146
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:36,636
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

147
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,474
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

148
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:42,554
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

149
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,032
That tears it.

150
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,389
- 8:30 tomorrow evening then.
- That's what I suggested.

151
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:54,027
- Will you be here, too?
- I guess so, I usually am.

152
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,346
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

153
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:58,344
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

154
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,144
I wonder if you wonder.

155
00:12:04,662 --> 00:12:06,941
<i>It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...</i>

156
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,820
<i>the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.</i>

157
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:13,977
<i>How could I have known that murder
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

158
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,176
<i>Maybe you would
have known, Keyes...</i>

159
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:18,735
<i>the minute she mentioned
accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

160
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,573
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

161
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:24,411
<i>I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.</i>

162
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,609
<i>It was the day you had that truck
driver from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

163
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,929
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

164
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,288
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

165
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,207
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

166
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,165
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

167
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:37,165
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

168
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,402
- Hello, Walter.
- Hi, George.

169
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,479
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

170
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,359
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

171
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,398
- You're in a jam and you know it.
- Says you.

172
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,597
- All I want is my money.
- Says you.

173
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:55,196
- All you're gonna get is the cops.
- Hello, Walter.

174
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:58,313
- This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood.
- Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

175
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:01,191
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

176
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:05,350
- I ain't so good. My truck burned down.
- Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

177
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:08,468
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

178
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:10,706
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

179
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:13,665
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

180
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:17,624
- What little man?
- The little man in here.

181
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:20,782
Every time one of these phonies comes
along, it ties knots in my stomach.

182
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,221
I can't eat.

183
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:25,379
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's
how I knew your claim was crooked.

184
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,899
So what did I do?

185
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:29,458
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

186
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:31,336
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

187
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,855
And what did they find?

188
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:36,094
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

189
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,652
What shavings?

190
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,131
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

191
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,688
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor
guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

192
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:48,968
That's one way
of putting it.

193
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:51,166
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

194
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:53,365
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

195
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:56,203
- Sign what?
- It's a waiver on your claim. Right here.

196
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:58,682
- Here?
- Here.

197
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,158
Now you're an honest man
again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

198
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,118
But I ain't got no more truck.

199
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:09,476
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

200
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,914
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't
you know how to open the door?

201
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:15,153
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

202
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,872
Now pull it toward you.

203
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:22,469
- That's the boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

204
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:27,867
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

205
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:30,545
Are we an insurance company, or
just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

206
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:31,785
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

207
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:33,423
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

208
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:34,983
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

209
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:36,022
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

210
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:37,741
- before we accepted the risk.
- I know you did, Walter.

211
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:40,379
I'm not beefing at you. It's the
company. It's the way they do things.

212
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,499
The way they don't do things!

213
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,178
The way they'll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet.

214
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,657
And I'm the guy that has to sit
here up to my neck in phony claims...

215
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:49,536
so they won't throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door.

216
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:51,334
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

217
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:54,613
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick
up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

218
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:56,292
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

219
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,171
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

220
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,729
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

221
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,688
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

222
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:06,407
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

223
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:08,725
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

224
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:11,404
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

225
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:13,962
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

226
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,402
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

227
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:18,121
<i>and find out if their calendar checked
with the World Almanac's calendar.</i>

228
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,359
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

229
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,518
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

230
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,355
I love you, too.

231
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:35,950
<i>I really did,
too, you old crab...</i>

232
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,189
<i>always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.</i>

233
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,908
<i>But you never fooled me with your
song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

234
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:45,347
<i>I kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

235
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:47,705
<i>you had a heart
as big as a house.</i>

236
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,782
<i>Back in my office there was a phone
message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

237
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,542
<i>about the renewals.</i>

238
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,660
<i>She didn't want me to come
tomorrow evening.</i>

239
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,259
<i>She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.</i>

240
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:02,937
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

241
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:04,896
<i>including a trip
down to Santa Monica...</i>

242
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:08,573
<i>to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.</i>

243
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:11,613
<i>But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

244
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:14,091
<i>and the way that anklet
of hers cut into her leg.</i>

245
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,766
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

246
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,325
I'm considering it.

247
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,362
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

248
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:33,281
Last night wasn't so
convenient. That's all right.

249
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

250
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,479
I was just fixing some iced
tea. Would you like a glass?

251
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:39,717
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

252
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:42,276
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

253
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:43,476
Nettie.

254
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:50,792
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

255
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:53,470
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll
renew with you, he told me so.

256
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,988
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

257
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:57,188
- But he's not?
- No.

258
00:16:58,307 --> 00:16:59,827
That's terrible.

259
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,386
Nettie!

260
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,583
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

261
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,422
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

262
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,700
- Lemon? Sugar?
= ix it your way.

263
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,738
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

264
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,857
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

265
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:22,615
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

266
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,534
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

267
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:28,132
I didn't think you'd learned
it from a correspondence course.

268
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:31,730
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

269
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,929
- You're not English, are you?
- No. Californian.

270
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,968
Born right here
in Los Angeles.

271
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:39,007
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

272
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:42,444
- Mr. Neff, I...
- Make it Walter, huh?

273
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:44,323
- Walter.
- That's right.

274
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:48,882
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

275
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:50,480
Twenty percent. Why?

276
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,079
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

277
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,638
I can always use it. I was
thinking about my husband.

278
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:58,036
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

279
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,275
- t's very dangerous.
- Not for an executive, is it?

280
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:01,714
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

281
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,952
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

282
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,192
It's got me worried sick.

283
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:07,511
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

284
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:09,950
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.

285
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,869
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

286
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:15,627
He's in the hospital with
a broken back. That's bad.

287
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,106
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

288
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:20,305
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

289
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:22,024
It could.
Well...

290
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:26,501
don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.

291
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,740
What kind of insurance
could he have?

292
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,939
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

293
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,978
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

294
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,336
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

295
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,535
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.

296
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,612
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

297
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,971
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

298
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,371
Well, your husband
would understand.

299
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:49,130
I'm sure I could sell him on the
idea of some accident protection.

300
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,688
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

301
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,807
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

302
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,887
They're all tough at first.

303
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,846
He has a lot on his mind.

304
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:58,564
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

305
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:01,364
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

306
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:05,481
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

307
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,039
- Sounds pretty dull.
- So, I just sit and knit.

308
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,637
Is that what you
married him for?

309
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,756
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

310
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,355
Anytime his thumbs
get tired...

311
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,713
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

312
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:21,792
- Wouldn't I?
- You bet your life, you wouldn't.

313
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,029
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

314
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:32,426
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

315
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:38,024
Could I get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all?

316
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:39,103
How's that, again?

317
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:42,022
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

318
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,540
I have a little
allowance of my own.

319
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:46,659
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

320
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:50,177
Why shouldn't he know?

321
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:52,537
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

322
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:56,374
He's superstitious about it. A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

323
00:19:56,454 --> 00:20:00,412
If there was a way to get it like
that, all the worry would be over.

324
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:04,290
- See what I mean, Walter?
- Sure. I got good eyesight.

325
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,009
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

326
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:09,966
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

327
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:12,725
- That's the setup, isn't it?
- Is there anything wrong with it?

328
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,045
No, I think it's lovely.

329
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,484
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

330
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:17,563
What crown block?

331
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:20,602
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

332
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:21,920
I don't know what
you're talking about.

333
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,360
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

334
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,399
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

335
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:28,478
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

336
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:30,716
- Are you crazy?
- Not that crazy.

337
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:34,354
- Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
- What's the matter?

338
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:39,111
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

339
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:42,430
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

340
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,909
That's a horrible
thing to say.

341
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:45,229
What'd you think
I was, anyway?

342
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,548
A guy that walks into a good
looking dame's front parlor and says:

343
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:49,506
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

344
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:50,786
"You got one that's been
around too long?

345
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,465
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

346
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:54,344
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect. "

347
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:57,942
- Boy, what a dope you must think I am.
- I think you're rotten.

348
00:20:57,982 --> 00:21:00,101
I think you're swell, so
long as I'm not your husband.

349
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:02,980
- Get out of here.
- You bet I'll get out of here, baby.

350
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,138
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

351
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,052
<i>So I let her have
it straight between the eyes.</i>

352
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,571
<i>She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.</i>

353
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:21,239
<i>I knew I had hold
of a red-hot poker...</i>

354
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,919
<i>and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.</i>

355
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,356
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer, the one I had wanted all along...</i>

356
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:32,113
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

357
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,033
<i>and everything
that went with it.</i>

358
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:37,151
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office
so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

359
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:39,630
<i>at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...</i>

360
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,668
<i>to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.</i>

361
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:47,545
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when
I left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

362
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:50,865
<i>So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.</i>

363
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,942
<i>It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...</i>

364
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,981
<i>and didn't even
turn on the light.</i>

365
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:58,779
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

366
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:00,619
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

367
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,377
<i>and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.</i>

368
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:07,375
<i>And right then it came over me that I
hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

369
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,774
<i>That the hook
was too strong...</i>

370
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:12,293
<i>that this wasn't the end
between her and me.</i>

371
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:13,971
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

372
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:19,249
<i>So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd
know who it was without even having to think.</i>

373
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:22,128
<i>As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.</i>

374
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:28,563
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

375
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:31,882
- Did I?
- Don't you want me to bring it in?

376
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:33,641
Sure.

377
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,000
Put it on the chair.

378
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:47,713
- How'd you know where I live?
- It's in the phone book.

379
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:50,192
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

380
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:53,031
Peel off your coat
and sit down.

381
00:22:55,989 --> 00:22:57,028
Your husband out?

382
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,988
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

383
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:01,147
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

384
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:04,384
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

385
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,824
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

386
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:08,743
- Like what?
- Like it was this afternoon.

387
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:11,981
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

388
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,859
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

389
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:16,099
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

390
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:18,897
- Not if you don't believe me.
- What do you want me to do?

391
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,496
I want you to be nice to me.

392
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:24,654
Like the first time
you came to the house.

393
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:26,853
It can't be
like the first time.

394
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,612
- Something's happened.
- I know it has.

395
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,091
It's happened to us.

396
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,366
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

397
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:42,485
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

398
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:44,964
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

399
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,282
Maybe I oughtn't
to have come.

400
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,921
- Maybe you oughtn't.
- You want me to go?

401
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,200
- If you want to.
- Right now?

402
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,518
Sure, right now.

403
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:12,228
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you, Walter.

404
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:14,906
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

405
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:17,826
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

406
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:20,985
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

407
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,823
- The kind that bubbles.
- All I got is bourbon.

408
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,740
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

409
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:35,256
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

410
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:44,451
- Club soda?
- Plain water, please.

411
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,129
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

412
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:51,448
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

413
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:53,767
Only he had
accident insurance.

414
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:56,245
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

415
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:58,324
- Who didn't?
- His wife.

416
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:02,723
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

417
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:05,880
His wife said he was cleaning a
gun and his stomach got in the way.

418
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,438
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

419
00:25:10,237 --> 00:25:12,197
Perhaps it was
worth it to her.

420
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:16,834
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

421
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,511
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

422
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,069
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

423
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,068
- Cook your own breakfast?
- Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.

424
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:31,987
- Get the rest down at the corner drugstore.
- Sounds wonderful.

425
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:33,706
Just strangers beside you.

426
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:36,344
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

427
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:37,983
You don't have to
sit across the table...

428
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:41,101
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

429
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:44,339
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

430
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:46,339
Lola. She lives with us.

431
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,817
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

432
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,535
- You ever think of a divorce?
- He wouldn't give me a divorce.

433
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:52,975
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

434
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:55,494
He hasn't got any money. Not since
he went into the oil business.

435
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:57,253
But he had
when you married him?

436
00:25:57,732 --> 00:26:01,651
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

437
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,968
But that's not the only
reason. I was his wife's nurse.

438
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:09,446
She was sick a long time. When she
died, he was terribly broken up.

439
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,845
- I pitied him so.
- And now you hate him.

440
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:15,723
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

441
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:18,601
Every time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off.

442
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,360
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

443
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:22,040
He's always been mean to me.

444
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,837
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

445
00:26:26,637 --> 00:26:28,915
- That Lola.
- Nothing for you at all?

446
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:31,315
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

447
00:26:32,354 --> 00:26:35,592
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas.

448
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:38,550
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

449
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,829
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

450
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:47,465
- Only sometimes you wish he was dead.
- Perhaps I do.

451
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:51,144
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

452
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,623
- Is that it?
- Perhaps that, too.

453
00:26:55,702 --> 00:26:58,660
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

454
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,418
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

455
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,136
and the motor still running.

456
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:08,055
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

457
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:11,333
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

458
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:12,532
I'll tell you what
it'd be like.

459
00:27:12,613 --> 00:27:15,091
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

460
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:17,170
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

461
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,128
For him a setup like that'd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef.

462
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:21,927
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

463
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,006
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

464
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:26,165
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

465
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,005
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

466
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:30,244
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

467
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:32,283
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

468
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:34,761
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

469
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:37,759
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

470
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:40,038
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

471
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,836
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

472
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:49,833
<i>So we just sat there.</i>

473
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:54,071
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain
on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

474
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:57,029
<i>Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.</i>

475
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,268
I couldn't.

476
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:01,667
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

477
00:28:01,706 --> 00:28:04,345
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

478
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:07,143
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

479
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:08,783
In this business
you can't sleep...

480
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:11,581
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

481
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:13,020
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

482
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,259
watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

483
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:19,856
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

484
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:21,376
And do it smart.

485
00:28:21,457 --> 00:28:23,455
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

486
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,574
You know every notch in it
by heart.

487
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:28,213
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

488
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:30,291
A shill to put down the bet.

489
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,370
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

490
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,768
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

491
00:28:38,447 --> 00:28:41,405
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

492
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:45,684
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

493
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:50,759
The stakes were $50,000, but
they were the life of a man, too.

494
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,998
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

495
00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:57,157
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

496
00:28:58,676 --> 00:28:59,796
<i>And I did.</i>

497
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,348
Will you phone me? Walter?

498
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,824
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

499
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:22,702
- You believe me, don't you, Walter?
- Sure I believe you.

500
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:28,420
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

501
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,739
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

502
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,298
It's better than
going on this way.

503
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,457
They're not gonna
hang you because...

504
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,256
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

505
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:37,935
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Sure, I know what I'm saying.

506
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,414
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

507
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:42,492
- And I'm the guy that knows how.
- Walter, you're hurting me.

508
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,451
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

509
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:46,890
It's got to be perfect.

510
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:01,642
Call me tomorrow. But not
from your house. From a booth.

511
00:30:01,682 --> 00:30:03,480
And watch your step
every single minute.

512
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:06,560
This has got to be perfect, you
understand? Straight down the line.

513
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,638
Straight down the line.

514
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:52,095
<i>That was it, Keyes.</i>

515
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:55,054
<i>The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.</i>

516
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:59,052
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

517
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:03,089
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

518
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,527
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

519
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:11,364
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

520
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,764
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

521
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:15,883
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

522
00:31:15,963 --> 00:31:20,281
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

523
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:22,720
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

524
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:27,356
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

525
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,795
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

526
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:33,233
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

527
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:36,232
to have her sitting right there in
the room, playing Chinese checkers...

528
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,790
<i>as if nothing
were going to happen.</i>

529
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:42,229
I suppose you
realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

530
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,548
that, not being an employee...

531
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:45,827
you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.

532
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:49,025
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

533
00:31:49,105 --> 00:31:50,224
Yeah, I know
all about that.

534
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:51,704
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

535
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:55,141
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

536
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:56,862
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

537
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:58,660
we'd stay broke paying
for it, wouldn't we, honey?

538
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,457
What keeps us broke is you going
out and buying five hats at a crack.

539
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:04,137
Who needs a hat in California?

540
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:05,816
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

541
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:08,254
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

542
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:11,054
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

543
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:12,173
Just as you say.

544
00:32:12,252 --> 00:32:14,931
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

545
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:16,171
Sure.

546
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:19,648
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

547
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:21,528
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

548
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,887
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?

549
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:25,166
Yes, I have.

550
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:28,125
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

551
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:31,203
- Run along where? Who with?
- Just Anne. We're going roller-skating.

552
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,962
- Anne who?
- Anne Matthews.

553
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,921
It's not that Nino
Zachetti again, is it?

554
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:36,319
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

555
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,559
If I ever catch you
with that...

556
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,958
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

557
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:41,036
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

558
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:44,076
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

559
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:46,514
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

560
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:49,033
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

561
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:51,351
- Good night, Phyllis.
- Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

562
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:53,351
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

563
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,030
Good night, Mr. Neff.

564
00:32:57,948 --> 00:32:59,828
A great little fighter
for her weight.

565
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,185
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

566
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:05,544
- Sign what?
- The applications for the auto renewals.

567
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:07,504
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

568
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:09,183
- When will that be?
- About a week.

569
00:33:09,262 --> 00:33:11,102
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

570
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:12,940
- San Francisco?
- Palo Alto.

571
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,660
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

572
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,059
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

573
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:20,536
What's wrong with that? Can't I
have a little fun, even once a year?

574
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:22,215
Great football school,
Stanford.

575
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:24,175
- Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?
- Left guard.

576
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:25,814
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

577
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:27,172
The bottom line.

578
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:33,570
- Both copies, please.
- Sign twice, huh?

579
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:34,888
Yes. One is
the agent's copy.

580
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:38,727
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

581
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:45,683
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

582
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,442
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

583
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:50,641
- How much you taking me for?
- $147.50.

584
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,319
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

585
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,518
Plenty.

586
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:00,835
- Bring me some soda when you come up, Phyllis.
- Good night, Mr. Neff.

587
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:01,874
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

588
00:34:01,954 --> 00:34:04,433
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

589
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:21,064
Good night, Mr. Neff.

590
00:34:23,622 --> 00:34:24,742
- All right, Walter?
- Fine.

591
00:34:24,822 --> 00:34:26,661
- He signed it, didn't he?
- Sure he signed it. You saw him.

592
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,580
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?

593
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,580
End of the month.

594
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,619
- He drives, huh?
- He always drives.

595
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,258
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

596
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:33,817
- Why?
- Because it's all worked out for a train.

597
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:36,136
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

598
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:38,015
a little thing called
double indemnity.

599
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:40,853
The insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers.

600
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,012
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

601
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:44,611
The kind that almost
never happen.

602
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:47,090
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

603
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:49,488
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

604
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:51,888
- I see.
- We're hitting it for the limit, baby.

605
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,366
That's why
it's got to be the train.

606
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:58,365
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

607
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:00,243
Straight down the line.

608
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,352
Hello, Mr. Neff.

609
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:22,912
It's me.

610
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,869
- Is anything wrong?
- I've been waiting for you.

611
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:26,988
For me? Why?

612
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:30,228
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

613
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:38,463
- Which way would that be?
- Down the hill. Down Vermont.

614
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:41,421
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

615
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:42,780
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

616
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,897
Going roller-skating, huh?

617
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:52,256
- You like roller-skating?
- I can take it or leave it.

618
00:35:53,414 --> 00:35:56,173
- Only tonight you're leaving it?
- Yes, I am.

619
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,050
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

620
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:03,329
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

621
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:07,127
- Sounds tough, all right.
- That's why I have to lie sometimes.

622
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,567
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

623
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:10,485
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

624
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:13,565
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

625
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:16,563
You won't tell on me,
will you?

626
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:19,241
- I'd have to think it over.
- Nino's not what my father says at all.

627
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,279
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

628
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:25,198
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

629
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:27,797
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

630
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:31,754
Then he lost his job for
talking back. He's so hot-headed.

631
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:34,153
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

632
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,592
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

633
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:38,830
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

634
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:42,509
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

635
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,947
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

636
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:50,025
I suppose it will sometime. This
is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

637
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,023
Nino? Over here, Nino.

638
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:05,776
- This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
- Hello, Nino.

639
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,416
The name is Zachetti.

640
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:10,054
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

641
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,173
I told him all about us.

642
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:12,532
Why does he have to
get told about us?

643
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:14,532
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

644
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,091
I'm not doing any worrying.

645
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:17,409
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

646
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,130
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

647
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,608
- Why, he's a friend.
- I don't have any friends.

648
00:37:21,688 --> 00:37:23,847
- If I did, I like to pick them myself.
= Come on.

649
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:26,166
Look, sonny, she needed a
ride, so I brought her along.

650
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:28,284
Is that anything
to get tough about?

651
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:30,723
All right, Lola, make up your
mind. Are you coming or aren't you?

652
00:37:30,803 --> 00:37:32,522
Of course I'm coming.

653
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,119
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

654
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,437
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

655
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:47,234
<i>She was a nice kid.</i>

656
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,352
<i>Maybe he was a little better
than he sounded.</i>

657
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,710
<i>But right then it gave me a nasty feeling
to be thinking about them at all...</i>

658
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,309
<i>with that briefcase right behind my head
that had her father's signature in it...</i>

659
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:59,427
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

660
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:01,626
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

661
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:05,585
<i>It was only a question of time,
and not very much time at that.</i>

662
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:08,303
<i>You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

663
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:12,421
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I
had picked for a meeting place.</i>

664
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,500
<i>I already had most of
the plan in my head...</i>

665
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,778
<i>but a lot of details
had to be worked out.</i>

666
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:20,256
<i>And she had to know them all
by heart when the time came.</i>

667
00:38:20,656 --> 00:38:23,175
<i>We had to be very careful
from now on.</i>

668
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:25,813
<i>We couldn't let anybody
see us together.</i>

669
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:28,652
<i>We couldn't even talk to
each other on the telephone.</i>

670
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:31,491
<i>Not from her house
or at my office, anyway.</i>

671
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:36,288
<i>So she was to be in the market every
morning about 11:00, buying stuff.</i>

672
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:39,805
<i>And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.</i>

673
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:42,084
<i>Sort of accidentally
on purpose.</i>

674
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:45,323
- Walter, I wanted to...
- Not so loud.

675
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,321
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

676
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:50,441
Let me talk first.
It's all set.

677
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,919
The accident policy came
through. I've got it in my pocket.

678
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:55,798
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

679
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:57,917
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

680
00:38:57,996 --> 00:39:00,715
The check's just made out to the
company, so it could be for anything.

681
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:03,473
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

682
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:06,471
Itll be all right that way, because
one of the cars is in your name.

683
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,231
Open your bag. Quick.

684
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,548
Can you get in
the safe-deposit box?

685
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:16,506
- Yes. We both have keys.
- Fine.

686
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:18,784
But don't put the policy in
there yet. I'll tell you when.

687
00:39:18,865 --> 00:39:21,503
Remember, you never saw it, you
never even touched it, you understand?

688
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:24,063
- I'm not a fool. Okay.
- When is he leaving on the train?

689
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:25,542
- That's just it. He isn't going.
- What?

690
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,421
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

691
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,020
What happened?

692
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:33,377
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

693
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,057
That one up there?

694
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:40,574
I don't know why they always
put what I want on the top shelf.

695
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,452
Go ahead. I'm listening.

696
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:45,770
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

697
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,449
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?

698
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,048
- Nothing. We just wait.
- Wait for what?

699
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:52,526
Until he can
take the train.

700
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:53,766
I told you it's got
to be the train.

701
00:39:53,847 --> 00:39:55,125
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

702
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:58,045
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

703
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:00,763
- There are other ways.
- We're not gonna do it other ways.

704
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:01,882
But we can't leave it
like this.

705
00:40:01,963 --> 00:40:04,801
What do you suppose would happen if
he found out about the accident policy?

706
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death house.

707
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,597
Don't ever talk like that. Don't let's
start losing our heads, that's all.

708
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:11,756
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.

709
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:16,794
Excuse me.

710
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,272
We're gonna do it right.
That's all I said.

711
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:22,791
It's the waiting
that's getting me.

712
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:24,270
It's getting me
just as bad, baby.

713
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,228
- But we've got to wait.
- Maybe we have, Walter, only...

714
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:30,627
it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

715
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,545
I better go, baby. I'm
thinking of you every minute.

716
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:44,740
<i>After that, a full week
went by and I didn't see her once.</i>

717
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,178
<i>I tried to keep my mind off
her and off the whole idea.</i>

718
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:51,016
<i>I kept telling myself that maybe
those Fates they say watch over you...</i>

719
00:40:51,096 --> 00:40:54,655
<i>had gotten together and broken
his leg to give me a way out.</i>

720
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:58,572
<i>Then it was the 15th of June.
You may remember that date, Keyes.</i>

721
00:40:59,932 --> 00:41:03,129
<i>You came into my office
around 3:00 in the afternoon.</i>

722
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,009
Hello, Keyes.

723
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,248
I just came
from Norton's office.

724
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:07,726
The semiannual sales
records are out.

725
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:10,605
You're high man, Walter. That's
twice in a row. Congratulations.

726
00:41:10,646 --> 00:41:13,245
- Thanks.
- How would you like a cheap drink?

727
00:41:13,324 --> 00:41:15,723
How would you like
a $50 cut in salary?

728
00:41:15,803 --> 00:41:17,962
- Do I laugh now or wait till it gets funny?
- No, I'm serious.

729
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:21,200
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

730
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:22,519
Too much pressure
on my nerves.

731
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,558
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

732
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:26,437
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

733
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:27,836
Me? Why pick on me?

734
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:30,315
Well, because I've got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job.

735
00:41:30,395 --> 00:41:31,754
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

736
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:34,873
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

737
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:36,631
You're too good
to be a salesman.

738
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,751
- Nobody's too good to be a salesman.
- Phooey!

739
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:42,148
All you guys do is just ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

740
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:44,307
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

741
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:45,867
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.

742
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:48,785
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

743
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:50,664
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

744
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:51,824
It's the hottest job
in the business.

745
00:41:51,864 --> 00:41:53,064
Yeah, but it's still
a desk job.

746
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:55,182
- I don't want to be nailed to a desk.
- Desk job?

747
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,740
Is that all you can see in it?

748
00:41:56,821 --> 00:41:59,700
Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

749
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:02,378
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around, and five sharp pencils...

750
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:06,616
and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

751
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:08,615
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

752
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:12,653
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

753
00:42:12,693 --> 00:42:15,411
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

754
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:19,129
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

755
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:22,208
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

756
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:24,487
with twisted hopes
and crooked dreams.

757
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:27,684
A claims man, Walter, is a
doctor and a bloodhound and a...

758
00:42:30,043 --> 00:42:32,083
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

759
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:35,360
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury...

760
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
and a father confessor,
all in one.

761
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,599
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

762
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,798
You don't want to work
with your brains?

763
00:42:39,878 --> 00:42:41,838
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

764
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:45,315
for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

765
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,794
- Walter Neff speaking.
- I had to call you, Walter.

766
00:42:47,874 --> 00:42:49,193
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?

767
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,631
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

768
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,348
No, you can't. I've only
got a minute. It can't wait.

769
00:42:57,429 --> 00:43:00,587
Listen. He's going tonight. On
the train. Are you listening?

770
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:03,146
- Walter?
- Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

771
00:43:03,824 --> 00:43:06,263
- Only, make it snappy, will you?
- He's on crutches.

772
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:09,542
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

773
00:43:09,582 --> 00:43:12,261
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

774
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:14,779
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

775
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,178
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

776
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:19,936
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

777
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:22,655
- Keyes, suppose I join you in your office?
- That's all right. I'll wait.

778
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:25,055
Only tell her
not to take all day.

779
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:27,813
Go ahead.

780
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:31,090
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

781
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,929
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

782
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:36,128
- And the signal is three honks on the horn.
- Okay. Anything else?

783
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:37,847
No.

784
00:43:38,086 --> 00:43:39,046
Oh, uh...

785
00:43:39,606 --> 00:43:41,125
what color did you pick?

786
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:44,004
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

787
00:43:44,684 --> 00:43:45,843
Mmm-hmm.

788
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:47,802
Yeah, that suits me fine.

789
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:50,080
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

790
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:53,039
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

791
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:55,157
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

792
00:43:57,157 --> 00:43:58,956
- Sorry, Keyes.
- What's the matter?

793
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,635
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

794
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:03,514
If I told you
it was a customer...

795
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,632
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

796
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:07,511
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

797
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,470
- Why don't you, for instance?
- I almost did, once. Long time ago.

798
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,228
Now look, Keyes, I've
got to call on a prospect.

799
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:15,707
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

800
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,946
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

801
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:20,705
I was on my way to the
jewelry store to buy the ring.

802
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,263
And then suddenly that little
man in here started working on me.

803
00:44:23,343 --> 00:44:24,822
So you went back
and had her investigated?

804
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,221
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

805
00:44:28,141 --> 00:44:30,419
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

806
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,898
There was a manic depressive in
her family, on her mother's side.

807
00:44:32,978 --> 00:44:34,537
She already had one husband.

808
00:44:34,617 --> 00:44:36,615
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

809
00:44:36,696 --> 00:44:38,654
- And as for her brother...
- I get the general idea.

810
00:44:38,735 --> 00:44:42,213
- She was a tramp from a long line of tramps.
- Yeah. All right, all right.

811
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:44,891
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for?

812
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:46,451
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.

813
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,929
- Thanks just the same.
- Fair enough.

814
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:51,968
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

815
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:54,126
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

816
00:44:54,207 --> 00:44:57,365
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

817
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:07,120
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

818
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,398
You're just a little taller.

819
00:45:19,872 --> 00:45:21,192
<i>Yes, Keyes.</i>

820
00:45:21,272 --> 00:45:24,709
<i>Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.</i>

821
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,988
<i>Now they had thrown the
switch. The gears had meshed.</i>

822
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:30,627
<i>The time for thinking
had all run out.</i>

823
00:45:31,347 --> 00:45:34,904
<i>I wanted my movements accounted
for up to the last possible moment.</i>

824
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:38,942
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate
book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

825
00:45:39,022 --> 00:45:40,942
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

826
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,939
<i>From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...</i>

827
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:46,019
<i>move by move.</i>

828
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,736
<i>I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.</i>

829
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:53,614
<i>This was another item
to establish my alibi.</i>

830
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:57,133
- Hi, Mr. Neff.
- Hello, Charlie.

831
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,971
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

832
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:00,172
How soon you gonna want it?

833
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:01,570
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

834
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:03,090
Any time you get
to it, Charlie.

835
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:05,289
- I'm staying in tonight.
- Okay.

836
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:07,288
<i>Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

837
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:09,566
<i>one of the salesmen
that shared my office.</i>

838
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:12,884
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll
call and there'd be a record of it.</i>

839
00:46:12,964 --> 00:46:15,164
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my
rate book and needed some dope...</i>

840
00:46:15,243 --> 00:46:18,042
<i>on the public liability bond
I was figuring.</i>

841
00:46:18,162 --> 00:46:21,800
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

842
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,839
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

843
00:46:24,878 --> 00:46:27,237
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

844
00:46:27,278 --> 00:46:31,115
<i>so I could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

845
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:33,153
<i>Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...</i>

846
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:35,912
<i>so that it would fall down
if the bell rang.</i>

847
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:39,350
<i>That way I'd know if anybody
had called me while I was away.</i>

848
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:43,428
<i>Then I did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me.</i>

849
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:47,426
<i>I left the apartment by the
service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

850
00:46:48,386 --> 00:46:51,505
<i>I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.</i>

851
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:52,903
<i>I didn't want
to take the bus...</i>

852
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,461
<i>because there was always the chance that
someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

853
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,460
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

854
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,338
<i>I could smell that
honeysuckle again.</i>

855
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,457
<i>Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.</i>

856
00:47:08,694 --> 00:47:11,773
<i>I slid the garage door open
as quietly as I could.</i>

857
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:15,011
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,
just the way I told her to.</i>

858
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:16,530
<i>I'd figured it was
safer that way...</i>

859
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,529
<i>in case he got into the car
before she drove it out.</i>

860
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:21,808
<i>I got into
the back of the car.</i>

861
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:24,246
<i>I lay there on the floor
and waited.</i>

862
00:47:24,326 --> 00:47:27,285
<i>All the time I was thinking about that
dark street on the way to the station...</i>

863
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:29,083
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

864
00:47:29,124 --> 00:47:31,802
<i>and the three honks on the
horn that were to be the signal.</i>

865
00:47:31,842 --> 00:47:34,161
<i>About 10 minutes later
they came down.</i>

866
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:35,880
- All right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

867
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,278
I'll have the car out
in a second.

868
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:16,738
- Take it easy, honey. We've got lots of time.
- Yeah.

869
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:37,328
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

870
00:48:37,408 --> 00:48:39,046
you might end up
with a shorter leg.

871
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:42,764
So what? I could break the other
one and match them up again.

872
00:48:43,124 --> 00:48:45,523
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

873
00:48:45,563 --> 00:48:49,121
It's only for four days. I'll
be back Monday at the latest.

874
00:49:04,554 --> 00:49:07,711
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

875
00:49:11,509 --> 00:49:13,548
What are you doing that for?

876
00:49:14,508 --> 00:49:16,867
What are you
honking the horn for?

877
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:16,475
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

878
00:50:16,554 --> 00:50:18,794
- Don't worry.
- Keep away from me as much as you can.

879
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,232
- Tell them I don't want to be helped.
- I said, don't worry, Walter.

880
00:50:21,272 --> 00:50:23,430
You start as soon as
the train leaves.

881
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:26,029
When you get to the refinery, turn
off the highway onto the dirt road.

882
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,589
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

883
00:50:27,668 --> 00:50:29,068
- to the dump beside the tracks.
- Remember.

884
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:31,546
- I remember everything.
- No speeding.

885
00:50:32,826 --> 00:50:35,424
You don't want any cops stopping
you with him in the back.

886
00:50:35,504 --> 00:50:37,743
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

887
00:50:37,823 --> 00:50:39,982
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

888
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:42,101
I'll be back on
the observation platform.

889
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:44,739
I'll drop off as close to
the spot as I can.

890
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:47,738
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

891
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:52,975
- San Francisco train, lady?
- Car 9, section 11. Just my husband.

892
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,454
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.

893
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,049
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

894
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,888
Car number 8. Up there.

895
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:15,443
- Car 9, section 11.
- Thank you.

896
00:51:17,962 --> 00:51:20,241
Here're the tickets. Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

897
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,640
- Yeah.
- You take it easy driving home.

898
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:24,998
- I'll miss you, honey.
- Section 11, sir.

899
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:28,596
- All aboard!
- Thank you.

900
00:51:28,676 --> 00:51:30,715
- Goodbye, honey.
- All aboard!

901
00:51:36,312 --> 00:51:37,871
Good luck, honey.

902
00:51:46,147 --> 00:51:47,666
Porter, will you make up
my berth right away?

903
00:51:47,746 --> 00:51:48,746
Yes, sir.

904
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:50,424
I'm going back to the
observation car for a smoke.

905
00:51:50,505 --> 00:51:52,144
Right this way, sir.

906
00:52:22,687 --> 00:52:24,086
Like a chair?

907
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:29,003
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

908
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:33,601
- You going far?
- Palo Alto.

909
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:35,441
My name's Jackson.

910
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,599
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

911
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,917
I had a broken arm once.

912
00:52:41,397 --> 00:52:44,556
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

913
00:52:44,636 --> 00:52:46,875
I thought I'd go crazy
with mine.

914
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:50,832
Palo Alto's a nice little
town. You a Stanford man?

915
00:52:51,592 --> 00:52:55,630
- I used to be.
- I'll bet you left something behind.

916
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:57,709
I always do.

917
00:52:57,868 --> 00:53:01,106
My cigar case. I guess I left it
in my overcoat back in the section.

918
00:53:01,147 --> 00:53:04,346
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister...

919
00:53:04,425 --> 00:53:05,384
Dietrichson.

920
00:53:05,864 --> 00:53:08,263
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.

921
00:53:08,943 --> 00:53:12,021
Maybe the porter could... Well,
I could get your cigars for you.

922
00:53:12,062 --> 00:53:15,299
- Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
- If it's not too much trouble.

923
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:19,017
- Car 9, section 11.
- Car 9, section 11. With pleasure.

924
00:54:01,475 --> 00:54:02,954
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

925
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:06,392
Here, take his hat. Pick up
the crutches back on the tracks.

926
00:54:34,457 --> 00:54:36,256
Okay, baby. That's it.

927
00:55:32,186 --> 00:55:33,865
All right. Let's go.

928
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,099
<i>On the way back,
we went over once more...</i>

929
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:46,538
<i>what she was to do
at the inquest...</i>

930
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,176
<i>if they had one, and about the
insurance, when that came up.</i>

931
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:53,255
<i>I was afraid she might go to pieces
a little, now that we had done it.</i>

932
00:55:53,335 --> 00:55:57,733
<i>But she was perfect. No nerves. Not
a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.</i>

933
00:55:58,693 --> 00:56:01,651
<i>She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.</i>

934
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:05,729
- Walter, what's the matter?
- Aren't you going to kiss me?

935
00:56:10,446 --> 00:56:12,964
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

936
00:56:17,522 --> 00:56:20,841
- I love you, Walter.
- I love you, baby.

937
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:37,071
<i>It was two minutes past 11:00, as
I went up the service stairs again.</i>

938
00:56:37,152 --> 00:56:40,950
<i>Nobody saw me this time either. In
the apartment I checked the bells.</i>

939
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:43,908
<i>The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.</i>

940
00:56:45,346 --> 00:56:49,145
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.</i>

941
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:53,903
<i>I had to go down to the garage.
I wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

942
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:03,097
- You gonna use your car, after all?
- I'm not quite through.

943
00:57:03,178 --> 00:57:04,976
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.

944
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:07,056
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

945
00:57:07,096 --> 00:57:09,973
Been working upstairs all night. My
stomach's getting a little sore at me.

946
00:57:10,014 --> 00:57:11,534
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

947
00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:15,331
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

948
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:17,969
<i>Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.</i>

949
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,328
<i>There was nothing
to give us away.</i>

950
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:23,887
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking
down the street to the drugstore...</i>

951
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:27,245
<i>suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.</i>

952
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:30,363
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.</i>

953
00:57:30,523 --> 00:57:32,842
<i>I couldn't hear
my own footsteps.</i>

954
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,000
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

955
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:48,074
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

956
00:57:48,114 --> 00:57:51,831
and the next day was worse, when
the story had broke in the papers...

957
00:57:51,912 --> 00:57:53,711
and they started talking
about it at the office...

958
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,909
and the day after that, when
you started digging into it.

959
00:57:56,949 --> 00:58:00,747
I kept my hands in my pockets
because I thought they were shaking.

960
00:58:00,786 --> 00:58:02,945
I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes.

961
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:06,824
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

962
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:09,875
I tried to
hold myself together, but...

963
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,072
<i>I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces.</i>

964
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:18,427
- Oh, Walter?
- Hello, Keyes.

965
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,745
Come along. The big boss
wants to see us.

966
00:58:20,825 --> 00:58:23,023
- The Dietrichson case?
- Must be.

967
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:25,062
- Anything wrong?
- Well, the guy is dead.

968
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:28,899
We had him insured and it's gonna
cost us dough. That's always wrong.

969
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:31,136
- What have they got so far?
- Autopsy report.

970
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:34,654
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no
predisposing medical cause of any kind.

971
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:36,532
Died of a broken neck.

972
00:58:36,653 --> 00:58:38,610
- When's the inquest?
- Had it this morning.

973
00:58:38,691 --> 00:58:40,648
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

974
00:58:40,728 --> 00:58:43,406
The train people and some of the
passengers told how he went through...

975
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:44,684
to the observation car.

976
00:58:44,765 --> 00:58:48,162
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

977
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,120
What do the police figure?

978
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:53,718
That he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train.

979
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:55,355
They're satisfied.

980
00:58:55,436 --> 00:58:57,953
- It's not their dough.
- Come on, Walter.

981
00:58:59,352 --> 00:59:01,151
All right. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

982
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,349
I believe the legal position
is now clear.

983
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:05,667
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

984
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:08,465
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

985
00:59:12,621 --> 00:59:14,859
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

986
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:17,777
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I
didn't know this was formal.

987
00:59:17,856 --> 00:59:19,175
- Sit down, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

988
00:59:19,215 --> 00:59:20,215
Any new developments?

989
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:22,813
I just talked to this Jackson long
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

990
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:23,851
Who's Jackson?

991
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,411
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

992
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:27,928
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

993
00:59:28,008 --> 00:59:29,966
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

994
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,645
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

995
00:59:31,684 --> 00:59:33,962
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

996
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:35,841
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

997
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,759
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

998
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,476
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

999
00:59:40,516 --> 00:59:42,914
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

1000
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:44,914
Anything else?
No, not much.

1001
00:59:44,993 --> 00:59:47,830
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

1002
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:51,148
There's a daughter, but all she
remembers is Neff talking to her father...

1003
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:53,345
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1004
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:54,745
I couldn't sell him at first.

1005
00:59:54,784 --> 00:59:57,622
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1006
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:00,740
Later I saw him in the
oil fields and closed him.

1007
01:00:00,819 --> 01:00:02,737
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1008
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:05,135
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1009
01:00:05,175 --> 01:00:06,734
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1010
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:08,693
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

1011
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,889
Are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train?

1012
01:00:11,969 --> 01:00:15,607
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1013
01:00:15,966 --> 01:00:18,164
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1014
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:19,683
Then what do you
think of this case?

1015
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:21,441
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1016
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:23,560
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1017
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,318
Just what is your opinion?

1018
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:27,037
- No opinion at all.
- Not even a hunch?

1019
01:00:27,116 --> 01:00:29,354
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1020
01:00:29,435 --> 01:00:30,713
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1021
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:34,310
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

1022
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,907
I think I know. In fact, I know I
know what happened to Dietrichson.

1023
01:00:37,988 --> 01:00:41,184
- You know you know what?
- I know it was not an accident.

1024
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:46,900
- What do you say to that?
- Me?

1025
01:00:48,218 --> 01:00:50,496
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1026
01:00:50,576 --> 01:00:53,974
There's a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office...

1027
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:59,529
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1028
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:01,527
There's a widespread
feeling that...

1029
01:01:01,607 --> 01:01:04,764
just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

1030
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:06,683
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1031
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:09,600
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1032
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:11,238
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1033
01:01:15,235 --> 01:01:17,552
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1034
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:20,270
I assure you I appreciate
it. This is Mr. Keyes.

1035
01:01:20,351 --> 01:01:21,750
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1036
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:23,787
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1037
01:01:23,828 --> 01:01:26,306
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?

1038
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,581
May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

1039
01:01:30,662 --> 01:01:33,060
I hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss.

1040
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,616
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

1041
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:38,175
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1042
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:40,773
No. All I know is that your
secretary made it sound very urgent.

1043
01:01:40,813 --> 01:01:42,852
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

1044
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:44,569
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1045
01:01:44,649 --> 01:01:47,247
No. I remember some talk at the
house, but he didn't seem to want it.

1046
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:50,484
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1047
01:01:50,565 --> 01:01:52,922
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1048
01:01:53,003 --> 01:01:54,721
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1049
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:56,679
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

1050
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:58,397
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1051
01:01:58,438 --> 01:01:59,836
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

1052
01:01:59,877 --> 01:02:01,434
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1053
01:02:01,515 --> 01:02:02,514
What sort of things?

1054
01:02:02,915 --> 01:02:04,952
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

1055
01:02:05,032 --> 01:02:07,990
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1056
01:02:08,029 --> 01:02:10,547
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1057
01:02:12,386 --> 01:02:14,904
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1058
01:02:16,102 --> 01:02:17,382
a suicide.

1059
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:23,896
- I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water?
- Please.

1060
01:02:28,452 --> 01:02:29,732
Thank you.

1061
01:02:35,445 --> 01:02:38,883
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1062
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,601
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1063
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,878
He was perfectly all right and I
don't know of any financial worries.

1064
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:46,955
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

1065
01:02:47,036 --> 01:02:50,993
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1066
01:02:51,113 --> 01:02:53,950
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

1067
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,547
- Do what?
- Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone.

1068
01:02:56,627 --> 01:03:00,065
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

1069
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:03,662
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

1070
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,858
Once there, he finds he is not
alone. There is a man there.

1071
01:03:06,938 --> 01:03:10,496
- What was his name, Keyes?
- His name was Jackson. Probably still is.

1072
01:03:10,975 --> 01:03:14,532
So he gets rid of this Jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1073
01:03:14,612 --> 01:03:17,770
- And then he is alone. And then he does it.
- Does what?

1074
01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:21,366
He jumps. Suicide. In which
case, the company is not liable.

1075
01:03:21,726 --> 01:03:24,483
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1076
01:03:24,564 --> 01:03:28,200
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1077
01:03:28,399 --> 01:03:31,557
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1078
01:03:31,637 --> 01:03:34,395
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1079
01:03:34,474 --> 01:03:36,833
A settlement for a certain
sum, a part of the policy value.

1080
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:40,429
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1081
01:03:40,509 --> 01:03:42,468
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1082
01:03:42,547 --> 01:03:44,866
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

1083
01:03:44,945 --> 01:03:47,184
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1084
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:50,460
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

1085
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:54,098
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1086
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:01,851
Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1087
01:04:01,931 --> 01:04:03,210
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

1088
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,367
Then you heaved an illegal forward
pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1089
01:04:06,408 --> 01:04:09,244
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1090
01:04:09,284 --> 01:04:12,202
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

1091
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:13,721
Oh, can we?

1092
01:04:13,761 --> 01:04:17,437
Mr. Norton, the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle.

1093
01:04:17,518 --> 01:04:21,115
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

1094
01:04:21,155 --> 01:04:24,591
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1095
01:04:24,671 --> 01:04:27,029
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1096
01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:29,107
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1097
01:04:29,187 --> 01:04:30,907
Yeah, in the front office.

1098
01:04:30,945 --> 01:04:33,983
Come now, you've never read an
actuarial table in your life, have you?

1099
01:04:34,063 --> 01:04:36,221
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1100
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:38,020
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1101
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,979
by sex, by seasons of
the year, by time of day.

1102
01:04:40,058 --> 01:04:43,295
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1103
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,933
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

1104
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:48,491
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1105
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:49,970
alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

1106
01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:52,647
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

1107
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,726
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1108
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:57,962
under the feet of horses, from
steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1109
01:04:58,163 --> 01:05:01,559
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

1110
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,918
from the rear end
of a moving train.

1111
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:04,677
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1112
01:05:04,757 --> 01:05:07,594
at the point where the body
was found? 15 miles an hour.

1113
01:05:07,674 --> 01:05:09,752
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1114
01:05:09,832 --> 01:05:12,549
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1115
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:14,269
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1116
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:17,305
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

1117
01:05:17,386 --> 01:05:18,904
May I have this?

1118
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:23,621
Come on, Walter.

1119
01:05:26,657 --> 01:05:28,737
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1120
01:05:44,522 --> 01:05:46,840
<i>I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1121
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,400
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1122
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:51,116
<i>You were the only one
we were really scared of...</i>

1123
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:53,794
<i>and instead you were
almost playing on our team.</i>

1124
01:05:53,994 --> 01:05:56,872
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1125
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:58,910
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

1126
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,668
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1127
01:06:01,747 --> 01:06:03,905
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1128
01:06:03,985 --> 01:06:06,503
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

1129
01:06:12,658 --> 01:06:16,894
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1130
01:06:17,693 --> 01:06:19,172
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

1131
01:06:19,253 --> 01:06:22,369
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1132
01:06:22,409 --> 01:06:24,847
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

1133
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:27,405
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

1134
01:06:27,645 --> 01:06:29,643
Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful.

1135
01:06:29,722 --> 01:06:31,402
Don't let anybody see you.

1136
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,019
Hello, Keyes.

1137
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:05,973
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.

1138
01:07:06,491 --> 01:07:09,449
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?

1139
01:07:09,528 --> 01:07:12,926
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1140
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:15,164
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1141
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,083
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.

1142
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:20,759
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?

1143
01:07:20,918 --> 01:07:25,514
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1144
01:07:25,595 --> 01:07:27,234
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

1145
01:07:27,273 --> 01:07:29,512
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1146
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:33,268
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1147
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:36,186
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

1148
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,704
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1149
01:07:39,783 --> 01:07:41,901
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1150
01:07:41,981 --> 01:07:42,940
Yeah.
You got his check?

1151
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,139
Sure I did.

1152
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:47,735
Got any bicarbonate of soda?
No, I haven't.

1153
01:07:48,415 --> 01:07:51,932
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1154
01:07:52,452 --> 01:07:54,969
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1155
01:07:55,049 --> 01:07:57,367
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1156
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,966
No. Not suicide.

1157
01:07:59,565 --> 01:08:02,483
But not an accident, either.
What else?

1158
01:08:03,003 --> 01:08:04,201
Now look, Walter.

1159
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:07,119
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

1160
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:08,198
if he's killed on a train.

1161
01:08:08,279 --> 01:08:10,076
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1162
01:08:10,157 --> 01:08:13,992
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

1163
01:08:14,033 --> 01:08:16,590
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1164
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:19,468
One out of I don't know
how many billions.

1165
01:08:20,188 --> 01:08:24,664
And add to that the broken leg. No,
it just can't be the way it looks.

1166
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:29,060
Something has been worked
on us. Such as what?

1167
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:37,893
Murder?

1168
01:08:38,371 --> 01:08:40,130
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

1169
01:08:40,211 --> 01:08:42,888
Sorry. Want a little
soda water? No, no, no.

1170
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:45,166
Who do you suspect?

1171
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:47,085
Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

1172
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,083
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

1173
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:50,201
- You mean the wife?
- Yeah.

1174
01:08:50,282 --> 01:08:52,759
That wide-eyed dame that just
didn't know anything about anything.

1175
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,758
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1176
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:56,037
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1177
01:08:56,116 --> 01:08:58,235
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

1178
01:08:58,315 --> 01:09:00,633
but all I know is that
it was worked.

1179
01:09:00,713 --> 01:09:02,391
I've got to
get to a drugstore.

1180
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:05,309
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1181
01:09:05,348 --> 01:09:07,946
- Good night, Walter.
- Good night, Keyes.

1182
01:09:08,267 --> 01:09:11,064
- See you at the office in the morning.
- Yeah.

1183
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,540
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

1184
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:18,617
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

1185
01:09:18,698 --> 01:09:21,256
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

1186
01:09:21,335 --> 01:09:22,813
They'd put her
through the wringer...

1187
01:09:22,894 --> 01:09:25,612
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1188
01:09:25,651 --> 01:09:27,610
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

1189
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:29,887
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

1190
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:34,004
all the percentage there is, and
this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

1191
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:38,281
Can I have
one of those things?

1192
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:51,069
- Good night, Keyes.
- So long, Walter.

1193
01:10:03,938 --> 01:10:06,976
- How much does he know?
- He doesn't know anything.

1194
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:09,653
It's those stinking
hunches of his.

1195
01:10:09,734 --> 01:10:11,012
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

1196
01:10:11,092 --> 01:10:14,930
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

1197
01:10:16,847 --> 01:10:19,285
- How long a while?
- Until this dies down.

1198
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:20,324
You don't know Keyes.

1199
01:10:20,404 --> 01:10:22,362
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1200
01:10:22,442 --> 01:10:24,081
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

1201
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:26,799
He'll watch you
every minute from now on.

1202
01:10:26,879 --> 01:10:29,277
- You afraid, baby?
- Yes, I'm afraid.

1203
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:34,153
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of
us. We're not the same anymore.

1204
01:10:34,192 --> 01:10:37,229
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1205
01:10:37,309 --> 01:10:38,988
- Isn't it, Walter?
- What're you talking about?

1206
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:42,625
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1207
01:10:44,023 --> 01:10:45,462
Shut up, baby.

1208
01:10:49,539 --> 01:10:51,816
<i>Pacific All
Risk. Good afternoon.</i>

1209
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:55,573
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1210
01:10:56,532 --> 01:10:58,492
- Hello.
- Lola Dietrichson.

1211
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:01,649
- Don't you remember me?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

1212
01:11:01,768 --> 01:11:03,886
Could I talk with you
just a few minutes?

1213
01:11:03,966 --> 01:11:06,284
Somewhere where
we could be alone?

1214
01:11:06,524 --> 01:11:08,602
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1215
01:11:14,717 --> 01:11:16,796
Is it something about
what happened?

1216
01:11:16,835 --> 01:11:20,313
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

1217
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:22,870
I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

1218
01:11:26,427 --> 01:11:28,945
Lou, do you mind if I use the
office alone for a few minutes?

1219
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:30,823
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1220
01:11:37,497 --> 01:11:39,017
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1221
01:11:39,096 --> 01:11:42,373
I'm not crazy. I'm not
hysterical. I'm not even crying.

1222
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:46,730
But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

1223
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:50,686
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

1224
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:51,726
When your mother died?

1225
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:54,123
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1226
01:11:54,164 --> 01:11:55,122
We had a cabin there.

1227
01:11:55,202 --> 01:11:59,358
It was winter and very cold. My
mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1228
01:11:59,638 --> 01:12:01,317
She had a nurse with her.

1229
01:12:01,397 --> 01:12:04,274
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

1230
01:12:04,394 --> 01:12:06,951
One night I got up and
went into my mother's room.

1231
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:08,829
She was delirious with fever.

1232
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:12,427
All the bed covers were on the
floor and the windows were wide open.

1233
01:12:12,547 --> 01:12:13,627
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1234
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:15,825
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1235
01:12:15,904 --> 01:12:18,501
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

1236
01:12:19,141 --> 01:12:20,900
The nurse stood there.

1237
01:12:21,419 --> 01:12:24,897
She didn't say a word, but
there was a look in her eyes...

1238
01:12:25,057 --> 01:12:26,655
I'll never forget.

1239
01:12:28,653 --> 01:12:31,610
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1240
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:37,046
Do you know who
that nurse was?

1241
01:12:37,246 --> 01:12:38,804
- No. Who?
- Phyllis.

1242
01:12:39,284 --> 01:12:41,522
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1243
01:12:41,602 --> 01:12:44,640
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

1244
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,915
and I kind of talked myself out of the
idea she could have done anything like that.

1245
01:12:48,996 --> 01:12:53,271
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

1246
01:12:53,352 --> 01:12:57,029
You're not making sense, Miss
Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.

1247
01:12:57,069 --> 01:12:59,986
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

1248
01:13:00,066 --> 01:13:02,463
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1249
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:03,783
pinning a black veil to it.

1250
01:13:03,863 --> 01:13:07,140
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1251
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:09,179
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1252
01:13:09,258 --> 01:13:10,817
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

1253
01:13:10,897 --> 01:13:12,295
I caught her eyes
in the mirror.

1254
01:13:12,336 --> 01:13:15,253
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1255
01:13:15,332 --> 01:13:16,731
That same look.

1256
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:19,129
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

1257
01:13:19,209 --> 01:13:20,928
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1258
01:13:21,008 --> 01:13:23,366
I loathe her because she did
it. She did it for the money.

1259
01:13:23,406 --> 01:13:25,644
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1260
01:13:25,724 --> 01:13:28,722
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

1261
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:30,200
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

1262
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:34,436
- You'd better be careful, saying things like...
- I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1263
01:13:42,429 --> 01:13:43,668
I'm sorry.

1264
01:13:46,905 --> 01:13:49,144
I didn't mean to
act like this.

1265
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:53,259
All this that you've been telling
me, who else have you told?

1266
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,499
No one.

1267
01:13:54,619 --> 01:13:57,017
- How about your stepmother?
- Of course not.

1268
01:13:57,936 --> 01:13:59,415
I've moved out.

1269
01:14:00,494 --> 01:14:02,533
I'm not living
at home anymore.

1270
01:14:02,612 --> 01:14:05,050
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1271
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,887
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

1272
01:14:09,447 --> 01:14:11,205
Where are you living now?

1273
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:14,122
I got myself a little
apartment in Hollywood.

1274
01:14:14,402 --> 01:14:17,239
Four walls, and you just
sit and look at them?

1275
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:19,517
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1276
01:14:22,234 --> 01:14:23,714
<i>So that evening
I took her to dinner...</i>

1277
01:14:23,754 --> 01:14:27,270
<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.</i>

1278
01:14:27,351 --> 01:14:29,269
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1279
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:32,946
<i>The next day was Sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach.</i>

1280
01:14:33,026 --> 01:14:35,624
<i>She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.</i>

1281
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:39,100
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

1282
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,017
<i>It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.</i>

1283
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:43,936
<i>And I had no chance
to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1284
01:14:44,016 --> 01:14:46,135
<i>You were watching her
like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1285
01:14:46,175 --> 01:14:50,331
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I
was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

1286
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:54,367
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

1287
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:57,285
<i>For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.</i>

1288
01:14:57,365 --> 01:14:58,763
<i>It was worse.</i>

1289
01:14:59,323 --> 01:15:03,080
<i>Outside your door was the last
guy in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1290
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:13,791
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1291
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:18,026
- Hello, Keyes.
- I want to ask you something.

1292
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:20,224
After all the years
we've known each other...

1293
01:15:20,305 --> 01:15:22,144
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1294
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:23,742
- About what?
- About me.

1295
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:26,859
- Walter, I'm a very great man.
- Yeah?

1296
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:29,577
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1297
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,575
and murders don't come
any neater.

1298
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:34,373
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1299
01:15:34,453 --> 01:15:36,611
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1300
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:39,847
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

1301
01:15:39,928 --> 01:15:43,605
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

1302
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:46,283
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- You know what?

1303
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:49,439
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1304
01:15:50,559 --> 01:15:52,517
- He wasn't?
- No, he wasn't.

1305
01:15:54,037 --> 01:15:56,234
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

1306
01:15:56,314 --> 01:15:59,311
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1307
01:15:59,391 --> 01:16:01,749
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1308
01:16:01,788 --> 01:16:03,667
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

1309
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,825
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

1310
01:16:05,906 --> 01:16:09,463
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

1311
01:16:09,542 --> 01:16:10,701
and put him on the tracks.

1312
01:16:10,742 --> 01:16:13,898
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

1313
01:16:15,057 --> 01:16:16,536
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

1314
01:16:16,657 --> 01:16:18,335
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1315
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:22,091
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1316
01:16:22,371 --> 01:16:25,648
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1317
01:16:25,688 --> 01:16:27,367
then the somebody
else jumped off...

1318
01:16:27,447 --> 01:16:29,925
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

1319
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:32,523
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1320
01:16:33,321 --> 01:16:35,359
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1321
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:36,879
they have the crutches
to stare at...

1322
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,317
they never really looked
at the man at all.

1323
01:16:39,397 --> 01:16:41,475
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

1324
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:44,752
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1325
01:16:45,391 --> 01:16:47,230
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1326
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,067
The only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed Dietrichson...

1327
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,186
is sitting
right outside my office.

1328
01:16:52,226 --> 01:16:55,542
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1329
01:16:57,181 --> 01:16:59,898
- Come here, Mr. Jackson.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1330
01:17:00,018 --> 01:17:01,618
These are fine cigars
you smoke.

1331
01:17:01,698 --> 01:17:03,336
- Two for a quarter.
- That's what I said.

1332
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,894
Well, did you study
those photographs?

1333
01:17:04,975 --> 01:17:06,932
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1334
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:08,732
- Very thoroughly.
- Have you made up your mind?

1335
01:17:08,811 --> 01:17:10,729
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford
man. Medford, Oregon.

1336
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:12,848
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1337
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,845
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1338
01:17:15,925 --> 01:17:18,043
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1339
01:17:18,124 --> 01:17:19,082
Yes.

1340
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:21,679
- Then my answer is no.
- What do you mean, no?

1341
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,878
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1342
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:25,077
Will you swear to that?

1343
01:17:25,157 --> 01:17:27,076
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1344
01:17:27,155 --> 01:17:29,393
If I say it, I mean it. If I
mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1345
01:17:29,473 --> 01:17:31,031
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1346
01:17:31,112 --> 01:17:32,711
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1347
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:34,668
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

1348
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:36,067
- How are you?
- Very fine, thank you.

1349
01:17:36,107 --> 01:17:38,385
- Never was better.
- Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1350
01:17:38,465 --> 01:17:41,703
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

1351
01:17:41,742 --> 01:17:44,381
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1352
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,338
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1353
01:17:47,378 --> 01:17:49,336
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1354
01:17:49,417 --> 01:17:51,694
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1355
01:17:51,774 --> 01:17:54,532
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1356
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:57,130
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1357
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,368
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

1358
01:17:59,448 --> 01:18:01,966
- But I'm positive just the same.
- Thank you, Jackson.

1359
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:04,363
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

1360
01:18:04,444 --> 01:18:07,400
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.

1361
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,118
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1362
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:13,356
- Expenses paid, of course.
- Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1363
01:18:14,874 --> 01:18:17,392
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1364
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:19,990
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1365
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:23,986
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

1366
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:26,743
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

1367
01:18:26,823 --> 01:18:28,503
the Dietrichson claim.

1368
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:31,580
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

1369
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:32,699
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1370
01:18:32,778 --> 01:18:33,738
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1371
01:18:33,818 --> 01:18:35,297
No. Never been up there.

1372
01:18:35,496 --> 01:18:37,974
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1373
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:41,570
- Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way.
- Nope. I don't fish.

1374
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,008
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1375
01:18:45,528 --> 01:18:48,006
- There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis.
- No relation.

1376
01:18:48,085 --> 01:18:50,403
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1377
01:18:50,444 --> 01:18:52,681
- A very reputable man, too, I'm told.
- All right, Mr. Jackson.

1378
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:54,240
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1379
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,719
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1380
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,915
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1381
01:18:58,996 --> 01:18:59,956
Tonight?

1382
01:19:00,075 --> 01:19:03,152
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1383
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:05,910
- I'd like to see before I leave.
- Osteopath?

1384
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:09,347
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1385
01:19:10,227 --> 01:19:11,705
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1386
01:19:11,745 --> 01:19:13,983
- It's been a pleasure.
- Goodbye.

1387
01:19:16,181 --> 01:19:19,938
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

1388
01:19:20,019 --> 01:19:22,615
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

1389
01:19:22,695 --> 01:19:25,053
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

1390
01:19:25,133 --> 01:19:27,931
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1391
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:29,928
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1392
01:19:30,009 --> 01:19:32,727
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,
somewhere, they've got to meet.

1393
01:19:32,806 --> 01:19:34,046
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

1394
01:19:34,126 --> 01:19:37,402
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

1395
01:19:37,483 --> 01:19:39,840
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1396
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:41,240
But it isn't twice as safe.

1397
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:44,356
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1398
01:19:44,436 --> 01:19:46,475
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1399
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,233
where they can get off
at different stops.

1400
01:19:48,274 --> 01:19:50,472
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1401
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:51,950
all the way to
the end of the line.

1402
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:54,228
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

1403
01:19:54,308 --> 01:19:56,027
She put in her claim.

1404
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:59,144
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

1405
01:20:04,459 --> 01:20:06,178
Let her sue us if she dares.

1406
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:08,896
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

1407
01:20:08,975 --> 01:20:11,413
They'll be digging
their own graves.

1408
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:22,045
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1409
01:20:22,124 --> 01:20:25,002
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

1410
01:20:25,082 --> 01:20:28,478
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1411
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:56,974
- Hello, Walter.
- Come over here.

1412
01:21:00,531 --> 01:21:03,329
- What's the matter?
- Everything's the matter.

1413
01:21:05,287 --> 01:21:06,566
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1414
01:21:06,607 --> 01:21:09,123
He's sitting back with his mouth
watering, waiting for you to sue.

1415
01:21:09,163 --> 01:21:10,923
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1416
01:21:10,962 --> 01:21:13,760
- What's he got to stop me?
- He's got plenty.

1417
01:21:16,516 --> 01:21:17,796
He's figured out how
it was worked.

1418
01:21:17,876 --> 01:21:19,595
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1419
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,433
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1420
01:21:21,512 --> 01:21:23,751
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1421
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:27,188
Yeah? And then you're in court and a
lot of other things are going to come up.

1422
01:21:27,268 --> 01:21:30,944
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1423
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:32,864
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1424
01:21:32,903 --> 01:21:33,902
The way she died.

1425
01:21:33,982 --> 01:21:36,859
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

1426
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,618
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1427
01:21:38,698 --> 01:21:40,936
- She's been seeing you.
- I've been seeing her, if you want to know.

1428
01:21:41,015 --> 01:21:42,615
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1429
01:21:42,695 --> 01:21:45,333
She's putting on an act for you, crying
all over your shoulder, the lying...

1430
01:21:45,372 --> 01:21:47,611
Keep her out of this. All I'm
telling you is we're not going to sue.

1431
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:48,850
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1432
01:21:48,889 --> 01:21:50,049
even if you could have it,
because she's...

1433
01:21:50,128 --> 01:21:51,247
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

1434
01:21:51,327 --> 01:21:54,485
It isn't the money anymore. It's our
necks. We're pulling out, do you understand?

1435
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:57,363
- Because of what Keyes can do?
- You're not fooling me, Walter.

1436
01:21:57,402 --> 01:21:59,600
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1437
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,398
You're afraid she might find out
someday and you can't take it, can you?

1438
01:22:02,477 --> 01:22:04,316
I said, leave her out of this.

1439
01:22:09,072 --> 01:22:10,310
It's me I'm talking about.

1440
01:22:10,351 --> 01:22:12,428
- I don't want to be left out of it.
- Stop saying that.

1441
01:22:12,509 --> 01:22:13,868
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

1442
01:22:13,908 --> 01:22:16,426
- We can't go through with it, that's all.
- We have gone through with it.

1443
01:22:16,505 --> 01:22:17,545
The tough part
is all behind us.

1444
01:22:17,664 --> 01:22:20,022
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1445
01:22:20,421 --> 01:22:22,700
stick close together
the way we started out.

1446
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,979
Watch it.

1447
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:43,523
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1448
01:22:43,601 --> 01:22:46,959
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1449
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:50,516
- You planned the whole thing.
- I only wanted him dead.

1450
01:22:51,035 --> 01:22:53,593
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1451
01:22:53,673 --> 01:22:57,231
Is that what you're telling
me? And nobody's pulling out.

1452
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:59,828
We went into this together, we're
coming out at the end together.

1453
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:03,504
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1454
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,498
<i>Yes, I remembered.</i>

1455
01:23:12,817 --> 01:23:15,974
<i>Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1456
01:23:16,014 --> 01:23:18,412
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1457
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,770
<i>and how there was no getting
off till the end of the line...</i>

1458
01:23:22,328 --> 01:23:24,167
...where the cemetery was.

1459
01:23:25,526 --> 01:23:28,643
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1460
01:23:29,323 --> 01:23:31,441
They're to put dead people in.

1461
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:36,637
I guess that was the first time I
ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1462
01:23:36,676 --> 01:23:38,154
Dead, I mean.

1463
01:23:39,273 --> 01:23:41,792
And how it would be
if she were dead.

1464
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:45,709
<i>I saw Lola three or four times
that week.</i>

1465
01:23:46,348 --> 01:23:50,025
<i>One night we went up into the
hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

1466
01:23:50,224 --> 01:23:52,942
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it was only with her that...</i>

1467
01:23:53,022 --> 01:23:55,340
<i>I could relax
and let go a little.</i>

1468
01:24:24,275 --> 01:24:25,913
Why are you crying?

1469
01:24:27,751 --> 01:24:29,871
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1470
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:33,787
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1471
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:37,743
- It's about Nino.
- Zachetti? What about him?

1472
01:24:37,903 --> 01:24:40,661
They killed my father
together. He and Phyllis.

1473
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:43,099
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1474
01:24:43,898 --> 01:24:45,776
What makes you say that?

1475
01:24:46,176 --> 01:24:49,334
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

1476
01:24:49,413 --> 01:24:51,691
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

1477
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:55,848
Maybe he was just going with me as a
blind. And the night of the murder...

1478
01:24:55,928 --> 01:24:57,925
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1479
01:24:58,006 --> 01:25:01,403
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1480
01:25:01,443 --> 01:25:04,240
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1481
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:06,040
Sick!

1482
01:25:08,038 --> 01:25:12,274
He couldn't show up, because the
train was leaving with my father on it.

1483
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:20,787
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1484
01:25:21,785 --> 01:25:23,743
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1485
01:25:23,823 --> 01:25:27,740
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1486
01:25:33,855 --> 01:25:37,132
<i>Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

1487
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:42,647
<i>What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

1488
01:25:44,206 --> 01:25:47,204
<i>I tried to make sense
out of it and got nowhere.</i>

1489
01:25:47,682 --> 01:25:50,560
<i>But the real braintwister
came the next day.</i>

1490
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,917
<i>You sprang it on me, Keyes, after
office hours, when you caught me...</i>

1491
01:25:54,996 --> 01:25:56,835
<i>down in the lobby
of the building.</i>

1492
01:25:56,875 --> 01:25:59,033
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1493
01:26:03,469 --> 01:26:06,387
- Hello, Keyes.
- Just hang on to your hat, Walter.

1494
01:26:06,467 --> 01:26:08,345
- What for?
- Oh, nothing much.

1495
01:26:08,545 --> 01:26:11,342
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

1496
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,499
- How do you mean?
- The guy showed. That's how.

1497
01:26:15,658 --> 01:26:17,817
- What guy?
- The guy who helped her do it.

1498
01:26:17,857 --> 01:26:19,495
The somebody else?

1499
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,933
- No kidding?
- Yeah. She just filed suit against us.

1500
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:24,251
It's okay by me.

1501
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:27,249
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1502
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,486
- Come on. I'll buy you a martini, Walter.
- No thanks, Keyes.

1503
01:26:29,526 --> 01:26:30,486
With two olives.

1504
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:32,764
No, I've got to get a shave and
a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1505
01:26:32,844 --> 01:26:35,802
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

1506
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,039
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1507
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,358
All you have to do is
ask for them.

1508
01:26:39,438 --> 01:26:43,395
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1509
01:26:47,551 --> 01:26:49,510
<i>I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

1510
01:26:49,789 --> 01:26:52,507
<i>Maybe you were playing
cat-and-mouse with me.</i>

1511
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:55,584
<i>Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.</i>

1512
01:26:55,984 --> 01:27:00,021
<i>I had to find out, and I knew
where to look. In your office.</i>

1513
01:27:31,233 --> 01:27:32,672
<i>Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

1514
01:27:32,752 --> 01:27:34,350
<i>Confidential.
Dietrichson file.</i>

1515
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:37,747
<i>With regard to your proposal to put
Walter Neff under surveillance...</i>

1516
01:27:37,828 --> 01:27:39,466
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

1517
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,784
<i>I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1518
01:27:41,864 --> 01:27:45,541
<i>and he's definitely placed in
his apartment from 7:15 p. m. On.</i>

1519
01:27:46,101 --> 01:27:49,417
<i>In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

1520
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:52,655
<i>and I personally vouch for him
without reservation.</i>

1521
01:27:58,131 --> 01:28:00,927
<i>Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...</i>

1522
01:28:01,008 --> 01:28:03,246
<i>between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

1523
01:28:03,326 --> 01:28:06,963
<i>whereas I am now able to report that
such a connection has been established...</i>

1524
01:28:07,043 --> 01:28:09,081
<i>between her and another man.</i>

1525
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:11,998
<i>This man has been observed
to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

1526
01:28:12,038 --> 01:28:15,276
<i>on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

1527
01:28:15,995 --> 01:28:19,552
<i>We have succeeded in identifying
him as one Nino Zachetti...</i>

1528
01:28:19,672 --> 01:28:22,070
<i>former medical student,
age of 28...</i>

1529
01:28:22,149 --> 01:28:24,308
<i>residing at
Lilac Court Apartments...</i>

1530
01:28:24,388 --> 01:28:27,146
<i>12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.</i>

1531
01:28:27,665 --> 01:28:30,982
<i>We have checked Zachetti's movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1532
01:28:31,062 --> 01:28:33,740
<i>and have found that
they cannot be accounted for.</i>

1533
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:37,256
<i>I am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration.</i>

1534
01:28:37,336 --> 01:28:40,853
<i>It is my belief that we already have
sufficient evidence against Zachetti...</i>

1535
01:28:40,933 --> 01:28:43,891
<i>and Mrs. Dietrichson
to justify police action.</i>

1536
01:28:44,131 --> 01:28:47,008
<i>I strongly urge that this whole
matter be turned over to the office...</i>

1537
01:28:47,087 --> 01:28:48,927
<i>of the district attorney.</i>

1538
01:28:49,006 --> 01:28:51,004
<i>Respectfully, Barton Keyes.</i>

1539
01:29:25,695 --> 01:29:29,251
Phyllis? It's Walter. I've got to see you. Tonight.

1540
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:32,568
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1541
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:34,527
How's 11:00?

1542
01:29:35,646 --> 01:29:37,365
Don't worry about Keyes.

1543
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:40,282
Just leave the front door
unlocked and put the lights out.

1544
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:43,159
No, nobody's watching
the house. Not anymore.

1545
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,515
It's just for the neighbors. I
told you not to worry about Keyes.

1546
01:29:48,554 --> 01:29:51,353
- I'll see you at 11:00.
- Yeah.

1547
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:54,510
Goodbye, baby.

1548
01:29:58,267 --> 01:29:59,944
<i>I guess I
don't have to tell you...</i>

1549
01:30:00,025 --> 01:30:02,542
<i>what I intended to do
at 11:00, Keyes.</i>

1550
01:30:02,623 --> 01:30:06,060
<i>For the first time, I saw a way to
get clear of the whole mess I was in...</i>

1551
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,818
<i>and of Phyllis, too,
all at the same time.</i>

1552
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:11,175
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

1553
01:30:11,815 --> 01:30:15,052
<i>What I didn't know was that
she had plans of her own.</i>

1554
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:13,601
In here, Walter.

1555
01:31:27,829 --> 01:31:29,188
Hello, baby.

1556
01:31:31,307 --> 01:31:33,905
- Anybody else in the house?
- Nobody. Why?

1557
01:31:35,383 --> 01:31:38,180
- What's that music?
- A radio up the street.

1558
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:49,130
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1559
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:51,928
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

1560
01:31:52,288 --> 01:31:54,686
Only you were thinking
about murder.

1561
01:31:55,725 --> 01:31:57,564
I was thinking about
that anklet.

1562
01:31:57,604 --> 01:31:59,401
And what are you
thinking about now?

1563
01:31:59,482 --> 01:32:01,679
I'm all through thinking,
baby.

1564
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,038
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?

1565
01:32:04,277 --> 01:32:08,074
- Where are you going?
- You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.

1566
01:32:08,354 --> 01:32:10,832
I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.

1567
01:32:10,911 --> 01:32:13,310
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1568
01:32:13,389 --> 01:32:16,667
All right, I'll tell you. A friend
of mine's got a funny theory.

1569
01:32:17,067 --> 01:32:19,905
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

1570
01:32:19,984 --> 01:32:22,503
on a trolley car together. One
can't get off without the other.

1571
01:32:22,581 --> 01:32:24,780
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1572
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:27,018
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

1573
01:32:27,098 --> 01:32:29,297
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

1574
01:32:29,376 --> 01:32:32,413
- Maybe he's got something there.
- You bet he has.

1575
01:32:32,493 --> 01:32:35,130
Two people are gonna ride to
the end of the line, all right.

1576
01:32:35,211 --> 01:32:39,448
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1577
01:32:39,527 --> 01:32:42,845
- Just who are you talking about?
- An acquaintance of yours.

1578
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:44,164
A Mr. Zachetti.

1579
01:32:44,243 --> 01:32:45,961
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1580
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:48,559
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

1581
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,598
I was a sucker.

1582
01:32:49,678 --> 01:32:52,316
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

1583
01:32:52,396 --> 01:32:54,954
- Nobody wanted to brush you off.
- Save it. I'm telling this.

1584
01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:57,351
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

1585
01:32:57,432 --> 01:32:58,950
That's not true.

1586
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:02,028
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1587
01:33:03,267 --> 01:33:06,583
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

1588
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:09,621
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

1589
01:33:09,661 --> 01:33:12,899
- What's happening to me all this time?
- Don't be silly, baby.

1590
01:33:17,974 --> 01:33:21,971
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1591
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,249
That's what Keyes thinks.

1592
01:33:23,329 --> 01:33:25,488
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

1593
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:29,724
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1594
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:31,602
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1595
01:33:31,722 --> 01:33:36,038
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1596
01:33:36,358 --> 01:33:40,194
And if it was you, they'd charge that
up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1597
01:33:40,274 --> 01:33:43,831
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

1598
01:33:44,271 --> 01:33:46,630
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1599
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:50,025
- With the cops right behind him.
- It's all taken care of.

1600
01:33:51,105 --> 01:33:53,264
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1601
01:33:53,343 --> 01:33:57,059
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

1602
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,539
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

1603
01:33:58,779 --> 01:34:01,696
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

1604
01:34:01,777 --> 01:34:04,014
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

1605
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:05,453
so we can get the money
and be together.

1606
01:34:05,853 --> 01:34:08,850
That's cute. Say it again. He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

1607
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:10,888
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1608
01:34:10,969 --> 01:34:12,887
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1609
01:34:12,926 --> 01:34:15,045
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

1610
01:34:15,124 --> 01:34:19,321
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1611
01:34:19,401 --> 01:34:21,998
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1612
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:25,955
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

1613
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:28,393
We're both rotten.

1614
01:34:28,474 --> 01:34:30,072
Only you're
a little more rotten.

1615
01:34:30,152 --> 01:34:32,149
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1616
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:35,628
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

1617
01:34:35,667 --> 01:34:38,624
Then somebody else would have come
along to take care of Zachetti for you.

1618
01:34:38,704 --> 01:34:41,262
- That's the way you operate, isn't it, baby?
- Suppose it is.

1619
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:44,499
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1620
01:34:45,299 --> 01:34:48,855
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1621
01:35:08,318 --> 01:35:11,117
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1622
01:35:11,356 --> 01:35:13,034
Better try it again.

1623
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:17,950
Maybe if I came
a little closer?

1624
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:30,419
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1625
01:35:39,051 --> 01:35:41,330
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

1626
01:35:46,805 --> 01:35:50,602
Don't tell me it's because you've
been in love with me all this time.

1627
01:35:50,683 --> 01:35:53,999
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1628
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:57,356
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1629
01:35:57,396 --> 01:35:59,755
That's all you
ever meant to me...

1630
01:36:00,873 --> 01:36:02,512
until a minute ago...

1631
01:36:03,631 --> 01:36:06,148
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

1632
01:36:07,668 --> 01:36:10,305
I never thought
that could happen to me.

1633
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,702
- Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
- I'm not asking you to buy.

1634
01:36:13,782 --> 01:36:15,461
Just hold me close.

1635
01:36:21,615 --> 01:36:23,053
Goodbye, baby.

1636
01:37:15,409 --> 01:37:16,648
Zachetti.

1637
01:37:18,725 --> 01:37:20,005
Come here.

1638
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:27,199
I said, come here.

1639
01:37:29,836 --> 01:37:32,754
- My name is Neff.
- Yeah, and I still don't like it.

1640
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:34,393
What do you want?

1641
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:35,711
Look, kid.

1642
01:37:36,831 --> 01:37:39,947
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1643
01:37:40,108 --> 01:37:42,066
What's the gag? Suppose you
go on back down the hill...

1644
01:37:42,146 --> 01:37:43,664
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

1645
01:37:43,745 --> 01:37:45,783
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

1646
01:37:45,822 --> 01:37:47,541
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1647
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:50,059
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1648
01:37:50,138 --> 01:37:51,178
She isn't worth a nickel.

1649
01:37:51,258 --> 01:37:53,616
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1650
01:37:53,696 --> 01:37:54,695
Tough, aren't you?

1651
01:37:54,774 --> 01:37:56,694
Here, take the nickel and
call her. She wants you to.

1652
01:37:56,773 --> 01:37:58,452
She doesn't want
any part of me.

1653
01:37:58,732 --> 01:38:01,170
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1654
01:38:01,249 --> 01:38:03,687
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1655
01:38:03,768 --> 01:38:05,885
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1656
01:38:05,966 --> 01:38:09,082
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1657
01:38:09,722 --> 01:38:11,241
Go on. That way.

1658
01:38:21,073 --> 01:38:23,151
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1659
01:38:24,469 --> 01:38:25,508
It's cold.

1660
01:38:27,467 --> 01:38:30,943
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house...

1661
01:38:30,983 --> 01:38:33,022
or if they've found her
by now.

1662
01:38:34,661 --> 01:38:37,818
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1663
01:38:41,894 --> 01:38:44,772
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1664
01:38:45,611 --> 01:38:50,367
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1665
01:38:51,966 --> 01:38:55,482
And I want you to take care
of her and that guy Zachetti...

1666
01:38:59,918 --> 01:39:02,595
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1667
01:39:04,475 --> 01:39:05,913
Hello, Keyes.

1668
01:39:15,425 --> 01:39:17,463
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1669
01:39:18,862 --> 01:39:22,059
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1670
01:39:22,739 --> 01:39:25,776
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

1671
01:39:25,857 --> 01:39:27,374
The janitor did.

1672
01:39:28,175 --> 01:39:30,692
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

1673
01:39:30,772 --> 01:39:31,811
Yeah.

1674
01:39:32,290 --> 01:39:34,089
Wouldn't be surprised.

1675
01:39:35,448 --> 01:39:38,845
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1676
01:39:39,204 --> 01:39:40,564
So I gather.

1677
01:39:42,162 --> 01:39:45,399
- How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough.

1678
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,317
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1679
01:39:49,196 --> 01:39:51,114
One you didn't
quite figure out.

1680
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:53,511
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1681
01:39:54,112 --> 01:39:56,750
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1682
01:39:57,949 --> 01:40:00,466
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

1683
01:40:01,466 --> 01:40:04,263
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

1684
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:07,141
Let's have it, Keyes.

1685
01:40:08,459 --> 01:40:11,536
Walter, you're all washed up.

1686
01:40:14,015 --> 01:40:16,452
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1687
01:40:17,731 --> 01:40:19,770
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1688
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:24,406
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1689
01:40:25,445 --> 01:40:28,003
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1690
01:40:28,082 --> 01:40:31,320
So I can walk into that gas chamber
up at San Quentin on my own power?

1691
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,918
Is that it, Keyes?

1692
01:40:32,998 --> 01:40:34,596
Something like that.

1693
01:40:35,516 --> 01:40:37,714
- I've got a different idea.
- Yeah?

1694
01:40:37,793 --> 01:40:39,114
Look, Keyes.

1695
01:40:39,432 --> 01:40:41,750
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

1696
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:44,068
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1697
01:40:44,148 --> 01:40:46,626
After that you can
play it any way you like.

1698
01:40:46,706 --> 01:40:49,183
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

1699
01:40:49,463 --> 01:40:53,221
- Give me one good reason.
- I need four hours to get where I'm going.

1700
01:40:53,301 --> 01:40:56,377
- You're not going anywhere, Walter.
- You bet I am.

1701
01:40:57,217 --> 01:41:00,014
- I'm going across the border.
- You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1702
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:01,573
Good enough to try for.

1703
01:41:01,653 --> 01:41:04,931
- You'll never make the border.
- That's what you think.

1704
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:07,048
Just watch me.

1705
01:41:07,488 --> 01:41:09,526
You'll never even make
the elevator.

1706
01:41:09,766 --> 01:41:10,725
So long, Keyes.

1707
01:41:39,141 --> 01:41:40,379
Hello...

1708
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,977
send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1709
01:41:45,096 --> 01:41:46,975
Yeah. It's a police job.

1710
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:08,436
- How you doing, Walter?
- Fine.

1711
01:42:10,594 --> 01:42:13,950
Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away.

1712
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:16,148
They're on the way.

1713
01:42:20,345 --> 01:42:22,864
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1714
01:42:22,903 --> 01:42:24,342
I'll tell you.

1715
01:42:24,862 --> 01:42:28,020
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1716
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:30,577
He was right across
the desk from you.

1717
01:42:30,776 --> 01:42:32,695
Closer than that, Walter.

1718
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:38,130
I love you, too.
