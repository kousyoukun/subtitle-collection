1
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,232
- OK Boan, how much you got here?
- About 1,800.

2
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:03,402
- What's going on?
- There's Bagley.

3
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:09,826
Mr. Bagley! Something haywire.
We haven't loaded enough pipe.

4
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:13,915
- Less than 2,000 feet.
- That'll be enough.

5
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:20,213
On Huangatan, it didn't come
until we were past 26,000 feet.

6
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:24,468
This hole proves out within 2,000,
or it's a write-off.

7
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:47,869
How are you this evening?

8
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:53,876
All right.

9
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:09,978
The barometer is still falling.
It's a lousy forecast all right.

10
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:13,857
We should stay here
another 48 hours.

11
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:18,487
Every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island.

12
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:21,782
- I thought only we knew...
- We'll sail right away.

13
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:25,287
You'll be sorry.

14
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:29,249
All right, Mr. Carnahan,
ready to let go.

15
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:35,506
- Stand by fore and aft.
- OK, haul the gangway ashore!

16
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:13,508
Let it go.

17
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,521
- Roy.
- Fred.

18
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:30,610
Well, here's to the big one.

19
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:51,342
MAIN TITLE

20
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:01,740
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

21
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:06,579
<i>Mayday.</i>

22
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:25,808
I'm reminded of Amsterdam.

23
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:32,024
Ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream?

24
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,796
<i>- Captain here.
- I picked up a mayday call.</i>

25
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:56,218
<i>- It faded before I could get a fix.
- Keep listening.</i>

26
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:59,931
Let me know if you get anything.

27
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:09,817
Like you said:
"The hell with the weather."

28
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:18,451
We can get out of this
by backtracking around Timor.

29
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,290
- It'll only cost us a few days.
- Keep on course, I'm fine.

30
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:31,925
I gotta admit, for a New York
desk guy, you got a lot of guts.

31
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:35,637
I sold this one to the board.

32
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:41,269
If that island doesn't produce huge,
I'll be wiping windshields.

33
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:58,788
Men.
Carnahan.

34
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:09,051
I'd have told you earlier,
but I couldn't risk any talk.

35
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:17,352
Men, we may be sailing into
the history books. Hit the lights.

36
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:23,441
I believe we're headed for
the biggest oil strike ever.

37
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:27,571
- Here in the magic circle.
- It's magic all right.

38
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:32,118
Are we supposed to find oil
under 2,000 fathoms of sea?

39
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:38,667
Just sea is what the charts say.
Now let's take a look a low angle.

40
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,589
This was taken in 1943.

41
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:47,928
This wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph.

42
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:54,184
No sign of land. Here's a fog bank
you wouldn't look at twice.

43
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,689
Let's look at another picture.

44
00:08:57,897 --> 00:09:01,943
This is taken from precisely
the same angle.

45
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:06,407
Same area, same fog bank.

46
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:14,499
This was taken two weeks ago.
35 years later.

47
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:20,172
A bank of fog that doesn't change
a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic.

48
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:24,510
Still nothing to explore,
except for one reason.

49
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,307
A spy satellite photographed it
by mistake.

50
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:35,815
I got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone.

51
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:40,278
No names, but he lives
on Pennsylvania Ave.

52
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:43,115
OK, fellas.

53
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:47,911
Roy Bagley, would you take over
and let science make the point?

54
00:09:54,878 --> 00:10:00,468
The satellite was to analyse
exhaust gases from a missile test.

55
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:04,973
So it was loaded with
two special kinds of film.

56
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:08,935
No, first the infrared.

57
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:15,443
The different colors represent
different surface temperatures.

58
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:19,447
- You mean there's land there?
- Correct, Joe.

59
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:23,577
An island,
hidden by a perpetual fog bank.

60
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:28,875
Never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot.

61
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:34,798
The infrared patterns aren't like
any I've ever seen.

62
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:39,679
More surprising, though, is
what the spectrograph picked up.

63
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,892
Chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank.

64
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:50,065
Free hydrocarbon radicals,
excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide.

65
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:54,320
And, not poisonous
but very damn curious...

66
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,327
This has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground.

67
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:04,581
- Vapors from petroleum deposits.
- Yes!

68
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:11,006
That island is the tip of a huge
underground tankjust waiting for us.

69
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:15,594
- I'm betting everything I've got.
- I'll take 50 cents of that.

70
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:21,017
The excess CO2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration.

71
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:25,814
- Turn the lights on.
- Animal breathing.

72
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:28,025
Are you crazy?

73
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:33,990
And I'm not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before.

74
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,247
In 1605, Fernando De Queres
was blown south from Tenotang.

75
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:46,087
He wrote of the piercing the
white veil. That's the cloud bank.

76
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,050
And landing on the beach of the skull,
where he heard the roar -

77
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,347
- of the greatest beast...

78
00:11:54,555 --> 00:12:00,312
The rest of that log entry
was suppressed by Rome.

79
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:05,609
In 1749, a water-logged lifeboat
was found in the same area.

80
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:11,783
It was empty,
but drawn in blood on the port -

81
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:19,041
- was a likeness of a huge,
slouchy humanoid thing.

82
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,877
And this strange warning:

83
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:28,635
"From thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven, lady, -

84
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:33,307
- God preserve thee."

85
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:39,606
I also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying Japanese in 1944...

86
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:43,527
What the hell are you talking about?
Who is this joker?

87
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:47,156
- Beats me.
- He's wearing a crew jersey.

88
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,201
I'll pay any fair amount
for my... passage.

89
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,580
- You're a stowaway?
- Jack Prescott. From Princeton.

90
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:56,917
- Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology.
- You lying hippie!

91
00:12:57,126 --> 00:13:01,923
You're from another oil company!
The meeting's over.

92
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:06,052
He's got one of our T-shirts.

93
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:16,397
This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf
or Exxon can fix a fake passport.

94
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:20,277
- Who the hell are you?
- I am Jack Prescott...

95
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:27,660
My interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil.

96
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,041
You're not even a good liar. You
couldn't find out where we're going.

97
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:38,547
- You bought charts!
- Come on. Who'd you pay off?

98
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:46,181
They hadn't sold charts for this area
in years. A friend tipped me.

99
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:51,020
I did pick up
some charts in Surabaya.

100
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:57,110
Take this spy below till he's hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit.

101
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,572
Let's go. Come on.

102
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:15,881
- There's something out there.
- Oh, come on!

103
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:20,178
- Honest to God, look!
- Quit horsing around.

104
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:24,391
Come back here!

105
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:29,647
There's something out there!
About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses.

106
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,777
Son of a bitch, it's a raft!

107
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:58,638
All stop.

108
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:34,386
She's alive!

109
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:51,990
Gently.

110
00:15:54,993 --> 00:16:00,124
I've had first-aid training, Captain.
Will you all clear out of here?

111
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,044
- You have to undress her, huh?
- It's usual.

112
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:07,549
In case of internal injury
or shock syndrome.

113
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,928
- Get outta here!
- Clear out.

114
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,944
Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills.

115
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:29,908
There's no sign of
injuries anywhere.

116
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:36,749
C-Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht.

117
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:42,672
- Careless yachtsman, to lose this.
- Remember that mayday call?

118
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:53,393
You can stop sweating. Navy
record's clean, it all checks out.

119
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:56,855
Fingerprints.
The guy's kosher.

120
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:02,403
I know just how to use him, too.

121
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:11,788
The girl's about to come to. She
could be hysterical, so follow me.

122
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:21,758
- Can I get a cheeseburger here?
- You went to medical school, right?

123
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:25,888
What have you got, crystal balls?

124
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:29,141
There's nothing I haven't checked.

125
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:33,104
I know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training.

126
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:37,734
Now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board.

127
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:44,408
- You're pretty good with a camera.
- I've snapped a few monkeys.

128
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:49,706
Congratulations.
You're now our official photographer.

129
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:20,408
Hello. Everything's fine.

130
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:25,205
You're safe and well
on an American merchant vessel.

131
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,046
Where's Harry and everyone?

132
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:44,309
- You mean they're gone?
- Do you remember anything?

133
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:51,776
No. No.

134
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,536
Yeah...

135
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:06,126
I was on deck and then...

136
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:11,883
- Then I was swimming to a star.
- To a light.

137
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,636
Let her call it a star.

138
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:21,435
The life-raft was blown over board
near you. It had an automatic flare.

139
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:25,314
I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge.

140
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,694
The yacht didn't get very far
after the SOS.

141
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:35,951
The radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull.

142
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:40,623
We're sorry, ma'am.

143
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,587
So am I.

144
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:51,094
Harry had discovered me.

145
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:58,435
He was going to put me in a movie
he was making in Hong Kong.

146
00:19:58,685 --> 00:20:01,772
Dumb luck.

147
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:07,362
But I guess I really can't complain.

148
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,703
When you're alone adrift
in the Pacific and somebody just...

149
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:20,043
- Who spotted me, by the way?
- That young fellow.

150
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:27,217
How can I ever thank you?

151
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,183
I'm Dwan.

152
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:42,651
D-W-A-N. That's my name.
Like Dawn, -

153
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:48,742
- except that I switched two letters
to make it more memorable.

154
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:54,123
- I'm a mere Jack.
- You must be kidding.

155
00:20:54,373 --> 00:21:00,380
How could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me?

156
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:04,009
You need some rest.

157
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:09,348
I haven't had a good one of those
in years.

158
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:16,106
- Are we headed back to Singapore?
- Not directly, ma'am.

159
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,702
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm in no rush.

160
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:36,212
Harry probably wouldn't have
put me in that movie anyhow.

161
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,306
Oh, my God!

162
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:52,272
What a meaningful miracle!

163
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:56,902
- I owe my life to a movie.
- Is that so?

164
00:21:57,111 --> 00:22:00,281
I swear to God.

165
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,327
Harry was showing
this film that I refused to watch.

166
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:09,708
That's why I was up on deck
when the yacht exploded.

167
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:15,882
Did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by "Deep Throat"?

168
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:19,761
Come on, men, let her rest.

169
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:29,355
Maybe my luck has changed.

170
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:28,699
You know something?

171
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:33,580
I always wondered how Cortes felt
when he first saw the Inca treasure.

172
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:37,625
It was Pizarro,
and he died busted.

173
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,236
Here we go...
Solid land all right.

174
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:08,410
This is its profile east to west.
Typical Pacific formation...

175
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,208
This would be the slope at the beach,
the mountainous sector at the west.

176
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,710
Let's get in closer.

177
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:21,509
- What was that?
- Just a glitch.

178
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,888
- False echo off a flock of birds.
- Spot anything unusual?

179
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:29,976
- Not a thing.
- Look at the screen, Fred.

180
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:41,989
All those going ashore,
report to the companionway.

181
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:50,625
Hi there.
How do you like this for beach wear?

182
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:55,004
Fantastic. I'm afraid
you can't come ashore, though.

183
00:25:55,213 --> 00:25:58,467
Wait a minute.

184
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:03,139
You said I could come
on the first boat.

185
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:07,018
You should wait
till the recon is gone.

186
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:11,022
You want full coverage
of this landing, don't you?

187
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:15,361
I must be in it. The all-American
girl saved from a yacht -

188
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,073
- by "Deep Throat".

189
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:25,289
- Don't print those, I'm married.
- Guaranteed to be on People Magazine.

190
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:29,627
- Printjust one.
- Really, Mr. Wilson...

191
00:26:29,878 --> 00:26:33,923
I need a break,
and you owe it to me.

192
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:39,346
Because I am a holder of
a Petrox credit card. I really am!

193
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,349
Ask your computer.

194
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:48,732
<i>I may be late on my payments, but
you take 18%% % interest plus charges.</i>

195
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:55,698
Dwan, you come ashore with us.
Captain, she'll come ashore.

196
00:26:55,948 --> 00:27:01,163
Good luck. As soon as you get
through, get on the horn.

197
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:10,965
Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him.
Fred Wilson.

198
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:17,223
I had my horoscope done
before I flew to Hong Kong.

199
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:20,601
- It said that I was...
- Here you go.

200
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:24,981
It said that I was going to cross
over water -

201
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:28,860
- and meet the biggest person
in my life.

202
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:22,212
That's interesting. The current is
18 degrees cooler than the air.

203
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:27,719
- What does that mean?
- The fog might lift at the edge.

204
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:32,099
Crossing 20 fathoms.
Shallowing rapidly.

205
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:41,193
Standing up ahead.
I think I hear breakers.

206
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:02,801
Shore boat to Explorer.
There's a curtain around the island.

207
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,887
We just broke through.
There's a beach dead ahead.

208
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:09,557
<i>In two words: No problem.</i>

209
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:16,466
Let me get down! I haven't
touched the ground in weeks.

210
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:27,438
That's good.

211
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:32,067
Jack! I'm coming ashore.

212
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:37,240
Wait, hold it. All right.

213
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:43,664
Beautiful.

214
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:54,510
Let's start getting a line on this
island. Bring the mosquito spray!

215
00:30:54,718 --> 00:31:00,975
We won't have to start wondering
which way to go.

216
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:05,063
You want to start setting
seismic charges this morning?

217
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:10,903
- Yes. Got to knock the stucture.
- All right, move out!

218
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:26,921
There's a waterfall ahead!

219
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:30,509
Last one to get in
is a rotten egg.

220
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,937
Don't go running off anymore.

221
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,484
We'll wait here for them.

222
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:29,575
Just stick close by me, OK?

223
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:57,758
Holy Mother!
That looks as old as the pyramids.

224
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:04,266
Could be. But the pyramids
weren't repaired six months ago.

225
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:10,690
There's earth on those timbers. It has
to be replaced after each monsoon.

226
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,153
Are you telling me
there's people here?

227
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:19,825
What's more, I'll characterize them.
Scared people.

228
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:24,830
- Scared of what?
- I don't exactly what it is.

229
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:31,296
But apparently, they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out.

230
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:35,009
Let me straighten you out
on a couple of points.

231
00:34:35,218 --> 00:34:40,806
One: This wall is an ancient ruin.

232
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:45,604
Two: The island is uninhabited.

233
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:58,953
And three: There's an uninhabited
German beer hall in there.

234
00:34:59,203 --> 00:35:01,789
Let's go.

235
00:36:12,243 --> 00:36:17,833
Fred? Look down there.
Take your binoculars.

236
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,673
- What?
- Down there, that pool.

237
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:39,191
- Do you think it could be?
- The surface seems viscous.

238
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:42,361
It sure as hell could be oil.

239
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:48,243
Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller!

240
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:13,604
- Maybe it's a wedding.
- A good guess.

241
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:18,485
It's scheduled for the night
when the moon's full.

242
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:25,535
Where's the groom?

243
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:38,300
See the one in the ape mask?

244
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:43,388
You might say
that's the groom's stand-in.

245
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:47,226
The groom is
on the other side of the wall.

246
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:51,606
You mean it's bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding?

247
00:37:51,814 --> 00:37:54,359
Ghastly luck
for the whole congregation.

248
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:26,145
Oh, Christ!

249
00:38:32,694 --> 00:38:35,697
You want to talk for us?

250
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,620
I'll try.

251
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:44,082
Shoot in the air only.

252
00:38:52,424 --> 00:38:55,345
What's he bitching about?

253
00:38:55,595 --> 00:39:01,268
He's probably telling us we've
contaminated their magic.

254
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:26,672
No.

255
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,308
Remember, in the air.

256
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:01,377
What is it?

257
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:07,301
He wants to make a deal.
Six of them for Dwan.

258
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:11,263
Tell them that I like him, too,
but not that way.

259
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:17,187
In the air!

260
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:48,165
- You'll have trouble with the chief.
- I will buy the chief.

261
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:52,086
What have we got
that wogs go for?

262
00:41:52,295 --> 00:41:57,008
Radios, pots and pans,
all sorts of junk.

263
00:41:57,258 --> 00:42:02,389
This is no longer the 19th century.
You can't just grab their island.

264
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,559
I'll check that with the UN.
In the meantime -

265
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:08,855
- we scare them into the boondocks
with a July 4th number.

266
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:11,942
Are your men ready
to set the charges?

267
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,444
Kong! Kong!

268
00:42:14,653 --> 00:42:19,283
You heard him chant.
He exists. You saw the wall.

269
00:42:19,492 --> 00:42:22,411
Who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to?

270
00:42:22,663 --> 00:42:28,669
It's some nutty religion.
A priest dresses up and gets laid.

271
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:32,423
We'll humor Jack.
Take plenty of TNT.

272
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:36,302
Any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet, send it bang-bang.

273
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:39,348
- You wouldn't.
- Bet me.

274
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:49,609
Even you wouldn't be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species.

275
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:56,701
The kids would burn every
Petrox gas station in the country.

276
00:43:09,465 --> 00:43:13,428
- He could be right.
- Kong, Kong, Kong...

277
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:20,519
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to steal a boat.

278
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:26,026
- Seriously?
- As soon as I've swiped supplies.

279
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:31,239
- I'm going on a camera hunt.
- That sounds dangerous.

280
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:36,662
It's a chance of a lifetime. You
either grab it or you're dead meat.

281
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:43,962
You shouldn't go ashore tonight.
It's not a good night for Aries.

282
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:47,550
How did you know I was an Aries?

283
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:53,306
By the shape of your ears.

284
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:59,104
All right, I asked Fred Wilson.
He knows everything about you.

285
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:05,362
- I really wish you wouldn't go.
- Is it better to watch an old movie?

286
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:08,073
There's nothing else to do.

287
00:44:08,323 --> 00:44:11,327
Use your imagination.

288
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:17,960
80 times around the deck
is a mile. We could jog.

289
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:32,392
I guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours.

290
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:39,149
Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing
in the galley.

291
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,238
You'll disappoint me if you're here
when I get back.

292
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:49,412
- What do you mean?
- I hope you'll wait in your cabin.

293
00:45:23,408 --> 00:45:27,872
Here you are, son.
Get it out right away.

294
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:30,958
All right.

295
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:38,133
I said that pool might be oil.
We can't be sure...

296
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:44,182
Think positive. Guys who think
negative don't get far at Petrox.

297
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:48,978
"Has to be the biggest ever.
No problems at all."

298
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:55,527
- Well, you're the boss.
- Don't worry about it, Roy.

299
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:19,347
Help!

300
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:26,522
Help me!

301
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:39,745
No!

302
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:30,219
We're too late.
Set off the show.

303
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:16,896
- Help him with that bolt.
- Cover the gate.

304
00:56:18,815 --> 00:56:22,570
Get on the other side!
Pull!

305
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:30,412
Open that gate!

306
00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:39,130
The lights will hold him back!
Don't shoot.

307
00:57:06,744 --> 00:57:10,082
- He's taken her.
- No one's taken her.

308
00:57:10,332 --> 00:57:14,879
Who do you think went through
there, some guy in an ape suit?

309
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:24,682
- You all right?
- I just fell in a Goddamn hole.

310
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:29,269
No, you didn't.
You're not in a hole.

311
00:57:29,478 --> 00:57:32,482
That's a footprint.

312
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:54,465
Carnahan here. We've gone over two
miles. There's still no sign of her.

313
00:57:54,716 --> 00:58:00,138
- It's better than finding remains.
- Unless he's gobbled her down.

314
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:05,352
Give me that thing.
Mostjungle apes eat only fruit.

315
00:58:05,602 --> 00:58:09,816
Mostjungle apes don't have
a size-90 foot.

316
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:13,570
The men have had it.
I'm going to pitch camp.

317
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,824
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
Come on.

318
00:58:17,074 --> 00:58:19,660
Keep moving.

319
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:26,460
Carnahan's right.
It makes more sense to stop.

320
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:30,380
All right, Carnahan.
You know the drill.

321
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:34,927
We'll plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets...

322
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:40,309
- Right, right!
- Will somebody be on the radar?

323
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:49,652
Any large, furry blimp seen moving
in your direction, you'll know.

324
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:57,119
That footprint measured 6.4 feet.

325
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:01,415
If that were for real.
How high would that make him?

326
00:59:01,624 --> 00:59:06,004
Multiplied by about eight, I guess.

327
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:10,968
He'd make a hell of a commercial.

328
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:16,140
"The battles we at Petrox fight
to fill your tank."

329
00:59:30,281 --> 00:59:34,203
If he's not going to eat her,
why did he take her?

330
00:59:37,456 --> 00:59:42,337
Apes are very territorial.
He'll probably take her to his turf.

331
00:59:42,587 --> 00:59:44,881
What for?

332
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:49,637
Joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her.

333
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:55,309
- Is that some kind of joke or...
- I don't know, Carnahan!

334
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:01,066
I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking
me so many dumb questions.

335
01:03:01,562 --> 01:03:04,732
I can't stand heights.

336
01:03:07,819 --> 01:03:14,868
Honest I can't. When I was ten I got
sick in the Empire State Building.

337
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:24,630
Put me down!

338
01:03:28,968 --> 01:03:31,555
You put me down!

339
01:03:37,394 --> 01:03:41,524
You put me down!

340
01:03:43,943 --> 01:03:47,740
Put me down.

341
01:03:52,953 --> 01:03:56,541
Please put me down.

342
01:04:10,974 --> 01:04:14,728
You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

343
01:04:14,978 --> 01:04:19,442
What are you waiting for?
You wanna eat me?

344
01:04:19,692 --> 01:04:26,658
Then go ahaed! Do it!
Go ahead and eat me!

345
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:31,246
Go ahead! Choke on me!

346
01:04:37,378 --> 01:04:42,426
I didn't mean that.
Sometimes I get too physical.

347
01:04:42,676 --> 01:04:47,807
It's a sign of insecurity,
like when you knock down trees.

348
01:04:50,644 --> 01:04:57,443
Such a nice ape.
Such a nice, sweet monkey.

349
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:02,949
We're going to be great friends.

350
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:09,832
I'm a Libra, what sign are you?
No, don't tell me.

351
01:05:10,082 --> 01:05:15,004
I'll bet you're an Aries.
Of course you are.

352
01:05:15,255 --> 01:05:18,591
I think that's just wonderful.

353
01:06:16,115 --> 01:06:19,118
Help me!

354
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,710
Help me!

355
01:07:16,016 --> 01:07:19,520
Radar had him on the screen.

356
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:26,736
3.6 kilometres west of your flare.
He moved in a random manner.

357
01:07:26,945 --> 01:07:31,492
- Not in our direction?
- Affirmative. Random. Like a circle.

358
01:07:31,701 --> 01:07:36,330
Maybe he's lost her. She got away
and he's searching for her.

359
01:07:36,581 --> 01:07:39,668
Carnahan! Wait a minute!

360
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:44,298
<i>- Have you set seismic charges?
- The men are doing it now.</i>

361
01:07:44,506 --> 01:07:48,887
- Don't move until it's finished.
- He's nuts.

362
01:07:49,137 --> 01:07:54,977
The girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turned-on ape.

363
01:07:55,227 --> 01:07:59,023
I know how you feel.

364
01:07:59,273 --> 01:08:01,943
But there's an energy crisis.

365
01:08:02,194 --> 01:08:06,823
We must all rise above
our self-interests.

366
01:08:07,032 --> 01:08:12,538
- You hypocritical bastard...
- Save your wind, he's signed off.

367
01:08:12,747 --> 01:08:15,208
Let's get going.

368
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:18,670
I ain't busting my ass for no whites.

369
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:24,844
OK. Who gives a shit that
the ape's headed in our direction?

370
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,545
- There's Roy.
- Well, Fred...

371
01:10:45,753 --> 01:10:49,257
I finished testing the samples
from that pool.

372
01:10:49,507 --> 01:10:53,887
- It'll be real great oil!
- Son of a bitch!

373
01:10:55,347 --> 01:10:58,017
Fred Wilson is crazy, is he?

374
01:10:58,226 --> 01:11:03,106
Wait till those candy-asses
in New York hear about this.

375
01:11:03,356 --> 01:11:07,570
- I'll grind them...
- Like I said, it will be great oil.

376
01:11:07,778 --> 01:11:13,452
As soon as Mother Nature
finishes cooking it a little longer.

377
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,079
How much longer?

378
01:11:16,329 --> 01:11:22,336
Hardly a tick of clock, in geological
terms. Say 10,000 years.

379
01:11:23,588 --> 01:11:29,761
Till then you'd get better mileage
filling your Cadillac with mule piss.

380
01:11:32,014 --> 01:11:34,683
Oh, my God!

381
01:11:36,478 --> 01:11:40,106
I hate to kick a fella when he's dead,
but I told you.

382
01:11:40,356 --> 01:11:45,488
You shouldn't have told New York
you were bringing in the big one.

383
01:11:48,824 --> 01:11:53,121
The big one. Jesus!

384
01:11:55,415 --> 01:12:00,129
Who says I ain't gonna?
Wilson to Explorer.

385
01:12:00,379 --> 01:12:04,133
Get me a channel to Surabaya,
I want an engineer drop.

386
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:24,073
OK, Jack, you go first.

387
01:12:56,776 --> 01:13:02,366
- Come on, it's solid as a rock.
- OK, let's go.

388
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:21,929
- Stop firing!
- Jack!

389
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:48,887
Boan! Try to make it back.

390
01:15:51,849 --> 01:15:55,102
I'm going on.

391
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:28,558
<i>All hands, stand by for recovery.</i>

392
01:16:47,662 --> 01:16:51,207
- Over and out.
- Recharge the batteries.

393
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:55,754
- Air drop done, right on target.
- Perfect. Haul your asses.

394
01:16:55,963 --> 01:17:00,010
Get that equipment working.

395
01:17:00,218 --> 01:17:02,846
- You think I'm crazy?
- You said it.

396
01:17:03,054 --> 01:17:08,394
If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon
would be crawling all over here.

397
01:17:08,603 --> 01:17:12,648
Not this one, pal.
Kong is all me and Petrox.

398
01:17:12,857 --> 01:17:18,614
A Fred S. Wilson exclusive.
Move your ass, Shorty.

399
01:17:22,744 --> 01:17:26,206
You think it'll ring the bell?
Promise oil, bring back a monkey?

400
01:17:26,414 --> 01:17:31,879
Look at Exxon's
"We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank".

401
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:37,552
Beach green to Carnahan.
Report back immediately.

402
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:41,264
Do nothing to endanger Kong.
Acknowledge.

403
01:17:42,641 --> 01:17:47,897
Carnahan, do you read me?
Do you read me?

404
01:18:20,642 --> 01:18:24,313
Give us a hand over here.

405
01:18:30,027 --> 01:18:34,158
Wilson!
Still no contact with Carnahan.

406
01:18:34,366 --> 01:18:38,537
- The radio's not working. No sweat.
- I want to take out a search party.

407
01:18:38,745 --> 01:18:43,918
- I can't spare any men.
- Six guys are cut off in the bush.

408
01:18:44,127 --> 01:18:49,717
And you're building monkey traps.
You're playing with their lives.

409
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:52,845
Don't worry about it.

410
01:18:58,768 --> 01:19:02,273
Boan!

411
01:19:05,693 --> 01:19:08,779
Where's the others?

412
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,496
Come on, Kong, forget about me.

413
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:58,378
This is never going to work.
Can't you see?

414
01:22:25,794 --> 01:22:28,463
Jack!

415
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:54,562
We've got to do it.

416
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:57,940
Are you ready?

417
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:30,268
Radar update. Monkey spotted
1,800 yards west by north-west -

418
01:24:30,476 --> 01:24:35,816
<i>- heading 0-89,
velocity 2.2 miles per hour.</i>

419
01:24:36,025 --> 01:24:40,739
<i>Estimated time to your position,
five minutes or less.</i>

420
01:24:40,947 --> 01:24:44,951
Kill the lights.
Everybody clear out!

421
01:24:52,752 --> 01:24:59,051
- Logan, how are you doing?
- Almost finished. One minute more.

422
01:25:03,513 --> 01:25:07,977
- That's enough.
- All set, Mr. Bagley!

423
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:15,152
- Ready, Boan?
- OK. It's hot now.

424
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:20,533
Are you sure that monkey will
be able to bust through that gate?

425
01:25:22,244 --> 01:25:25,580
Pull back the bolt halfway.

426
01:25:32,713 --> 01:25:35,884
- Come on.
- I can't.

427
01:26:15,721 --> 01:26:19,057
Open the gate! Help!

428
01:26:21,311 --> 01:26:24,814
- Help!
- Jack!

429
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:29,570
It's Prescott, open the gate.

430
01:26:46,422 --> 01:26:49,175
Come on!

431
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:05,818
Close the bolt!

432
01:28:43,262 --> 01:28:47,142
Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing!

433
01:31:41,672 --> 01:31:45,218
Still want to play?

434
01:31:47,178 --> 01:31:51,309
Dwan! Congratulations.

435
01:32:03,488 --> 01:32:06,868
Hey, Jack.
Do I look different?

436
01:32:08,786 --> 01:32:13,583
- Yeah, you shine.
- That's right.

437
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:16,712
- I'm a star.
- It's all set.

438
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:22,886
Coast-to-coast tour. We open in
New York. Lights, cameras, Kong!

439
01:32:23,094 --> 01:32:26,306
And probably Nureyev and Fontaine.

440
01:32:26,514 --> 01:32:31,938
I want Balanchine to choreograph
"The Beauty and the Beast".

441
01:32:33,856 --> 01:32:36,734
Any chance of you two
getting married?

442
01:32:36,943 --> 01:32:41,865
I don't know.
This is so sudden.

443
01:32:42,074 --> 01:32:47,455
We could think of some nutty way
of Kong giving away the bride.

444
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:57,800
It'd be tough to get him to do it.
Probably just old-fashioned, huh?

445
01:32:58,008 --> 01:33:02,722
I don't know.
What do you think, Jack?

446
01:33:11,983 --> 01:33:14,402
Christ.

447
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:24,414
After all these years,
I'll finally end up with a shrink.

448
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:35,676
How can I become a star
because of someone -

449
01:33:35,884 --> 01:33:41,266
- that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank?

450
01:33:41,474 --> 01:33:47,898
It's not someone. It's an animal
that tried to rape you.

451
01:33:48,107 --> 01:33:52,695
That's not true.
He risked his life to save me.

452
01:33:52,903 --> 01:33:55,657
He tried to rape you, honey.

453
01:33:55,866 --> 01:34:00,162
Ask the natives what they thought
of losing Kong.

454
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:04,667
- They'll miss him a lot.
- Like leprosy.

455
01:34:04,876 --> 01:34:11,467
You're dead wrong. He was the
terror, the mystery of their lives.

456
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:17,682
A year from now, the island
will be full of burned-out drunks.

457
01:34:17,891 --> 01:34:22,145
When we took Kong,
we kidnapped their god.

458
01:34:26,108 --> 01:34:29,278
It's like there's a curse
on all of us.

459
01:34:29,487 --> 01:34:32,490
I'm tired of your trying to confuse
this girl.

460
01:34:32,698 --> 01:34:36,411
This is her big chance. And yours.
There's stars at Princeton -

461
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:41,584
- just like in Hollywood. You want
me to get Kong another keeper?

462
01:34:41,793 --> 01:34:44,921
Coast-to-coast tours?
"Beauty and the Beast"? It's a farce.

463
01:34:45,129 --> 01:34:49,593
Just say the word and your contract
is torn up. Tell me right now.

464
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,560
See you opening night.

465
01:35:10,366 --> 01:35:14,621
Oh, God, I'm tired of thinking.

466
01:35:26,969 --> 01:35:32,016
- The ape had the right idea.
- What's that?

467
01:36:42,553 --> 01:36:45,683
Wait a minute.

468
01:36:49,061 --> 01:36:52,023
I'll be right back.

469
01:37:39,035 --> 01:37:42,496
<i>All hands on deck!</i>

470
01:37:47,085 --> 01:37:51,006
<i>Fire detail,
report to the control room.</i>

471
01:37:54,636 --> 01:37:58,765
<i>This is the captain.
Sea water pumps to full pressure.</i>

472
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:03,604
<i>"Prepare to flood tank No. 4.
I"m ordering the ape drowned.</i>

473
01:38:07,107 --> 01:38:11,446
Hey, Kong! Here I am.

474
01:38:16,994 --> 01:38:21,749
Do you remember me?
Remember your blind date?

475
01:38:21,957 --> 01:38:25,003
You haven't forgotten, have you?

476
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:38,894
Dwan! Come back here!
He's going berserk.

477
01:38:39,103 --> 01:38:43,273
- Stop, or I'll jump.
- Dwan, please.

478
01:38:43,482 --> 01:38:48,071
- You can't help him now.
- Don't come any closer.

479
01:38:48,279 --> 01:38:50,824
OK.

480
01:38:53,451 --> 01:38:59,417
Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up
all these people?

481
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:04,923
No one's going to hurt you.
You're just going to be a star.

482
01:39:14,017 --> 01:39:18,314
Don't flood the tank! She fell in.

483
01:41:26,499 --> 01:41:29,295
You could've...

484
01:42:30,614 --> 01:42:34,576
Jack! I'm so glad to see you.

485
01:42:37,539 --> 01:42:43,169
- What is it? You're not dressed.
- That's right.

486
01:42:43,378 --> 01:42:47,883
I was wrong when I called this
thing a farce, it's a tragedy.

487
01:42:48,092 --> 01:42:53,432
- I'm quitting your circus, Fred.
- You signed a contract.

488
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:56,560
- You took an advance.
- I donated it in your name.

489
01:42:56,768 --> 01:43:02,233
To the SPCA Fund for Sending
Kong Home. Here's your receipt.

490
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:07,363
- Sue me.
- Don't leave me tonight, please.

491
01:43:07,572 --> 01:43:11,702
- My horoscope says...
- Shut up. I love you.

492
01:43:15,622 --> 01:43:20,879
Come with me right now.
The hell with the contract.

493
01:43:21,087 --> 01:43:26,052
Go ahead. But I promise you
you'll never get another booking.

494
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:30,222
You'll end up tap-dancing
at rotary clubs.

495
01:43:32,684 --> 01:43:37,898
- Don't you understand?
- Yeah...

496
01:43:38,106 --> 01:43:42,779
I do. Sorry.

497
01:43:45,406 --> 01:43:48,660
Stay well.

498
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,357
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of our TV-satellite audience, -</i>

499
01:44:15,565 --> 01:44:19,404
<i>- you are seeing this
live around the world-</i>

500
01:44:19,612 --> 01:44:25,285
<i>- as it is happening
here in New York City.</i>

501
01:44:25,494 --> 01:44:32,292
<i>You have better seats than these
lucky King Kong contest winners.</i>

502
01:44:53,442 --> 01:44:59,198
Thus, Beauty set foot on the
forbidden island and was seized.

503
01:44:59,407 --> 01:45:02,785
Great was the fear
as Beauty was lashed -

504
01:45:02,994 --> 01:45:08,042
- to the dreadful bridal altar
of the Beast.

505
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:12,213
Now the earth booms.

506
01:45:46,377 --> 01:45:51,591
Kong's power!
Superpower!

507
01:45:53,635 --> 01:45:56,846
Hail the power!

508
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:35,515
That's the power of Kong,
and Petrox!

509
01:46:47,529 --> 01:46:50,365
No! Don't push her around!

510
01:46:58,834 --> 01:47:02,671
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to fear!

511
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:09,429
That is an escape-proof cage
certified by the city government.

512
01:47:33,206 --> 01:47:37,294
Come on out! Easy.

513
01:47:37,503 --> 01:47:41,173
His feet are still chained.

514
01:47:42,633 --> 01:47:46,596
It's all right. Come on.

515
01:49:45,313 --> 01:49:47,816
We're in position.

516
01:49:48,025 --> 01:49:52,863
The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned
up. What's the situation at Brooklyn?

517
01:49:53,072 --> 01:49:57,244
<i>"I" II tell that monkey to spread
before he crosses it.</i>

518
01:49:59,913 --> 01:50:03,208
Come on, there's a train coming.

519
01:52:04,804 --> 01:52:07,349
Hit the lights.

520
01:52:22,992 --> 01:52:27,163
<i>This is a message to all traffic.</i>

521
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:31,334
<i>Clear all streets.
Proceed to shelters.</i>

522
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:39,010
<i>Repeating: Clear all streets. Any
person found looting will be shot.</i>

523
01:52:57,113 --> 01:52:59,991
Keep running.

524
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:05,039
Jack! Buy me a drink, will you?

525
01:53:05,247 --> 01:53:08,168
Come on, buy me a drink.

526
01:53:08,376 --> 01:53:12,506
Ten more blocks and we've got
the key to a great apartment.

527
01:53:12,714 --> 01:53:15,635
We've put a river between us.

528
01:53:15,843 --> 01:53:20,264
The bridges are mined, and apes
don't swim. Your book says so.

529
01:53:20,473 --> 01:53:26,230
Please, buy me a drink.
Buy me a drink over there.

530
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:31,027
OK.

531
01:53:34,405 --> 01:53:37,367
What's the matter?

532
01:53:37,575 --> 01:53:43,124
Déjà vu. I don't know where,
but I've seen this view before.

533
01:54:17,621 --> 01:54:20,791
Here.

534
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,795
We don't want to get shot as looters.

535
01:54:25,005 --> 01:54:29,384
OK, get smashed.

536
01:54:29,593 --> 01:54:34,640
How about that nice offer
you made me? Do you still want me?

537
01:54:37,602 --> 01:54:43,609
Look, chinchilla.
Looks great on you.

538
01:54:43,817 --> 01:54:48,865
I asked you a question.

539
01:54:49,073 --> 01:54:52,911
- You know what I earn?
- Do you think I need furs?

540
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:59,335
Yes. Excitement is in your blood
like dope.

541
01:55:01,045 --> 01:55:05,801
You're going to need new fixes
I'm not able to give you.

542
01:55:06,009 --> 01:55:09,346
Don't be stupid.

543
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:49,475
It's OK.

544
01:55:51,394 --> 01:55:56,858
Probably some National Guardsman
ran his tank into a powerhouse.

545
01:55:57,066 --> 01:56:00,237
Do you remember that black-out?

546
01:56:00,446 --> 01:56:05,869
And all the babies born
exactly nine months later?

547
01:56:06,077 --> 01:56:10,915
Well, here's to all the future
sons and daughters of King Kong.

548
01:56:12,125 --> 01:56:15,171
I'll drink to that.

549
01:56:17,673 --> 01:56:24,431
The hell with furs. Tell me,
does that nice offer still stand?

550
01:56:26,224 --> 01:56:32,982
It depends on Kong. He's bigger
than both of us, know what I mean?

551
01:56:33,191 --> 01:56:35,986
Don't tease me, I'm serious.

552
01:56:41,909 --> 01:56:45,955
Of course. I know
where I've seen that view before.

553
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:04,100
I think we've got a chance. Sit tight,
I've got to make a phone call.

554
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:09,273
Keep it down, everyone.

555
01:57:09,482 --> 01:57:13,486
What do you think?
Is he flipped out or not?

556
01:57:13,694 --> 01:57:18,325
Hello? Hello...

557
01:57:18,534 --> 01:57:22,163
Excuse me, Professor. You say
you know where Kong is headed.

558
01:57:22,372 --> 01:57:26,000
Yes.
You can trap him without danger.

559
01:57:26,209 --> 01:57:30,673
Get some helicopters and
blasting nets on top of him.

560
01:57:30,881 --> 01:57:36,178
No problem. Where is he headed,
Professor Prescott?

561
01:57:36,387 --> 01:57:42,144
Promise me to capture him
without injury and I'll tell you.

562
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:55,617
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Professor.

563
01:57:55,826 --> 01:57:58,328
Where is Kong heading?

564
01:57:58,537 --> 01:58:04,210
A place in Manhattan that looks
exactly like his natural habitat.

565
01:58:04,419 --> 01:58:08,757
Let him climb to the top of
the World Trade Center.

566
01:58:48,093 --> 01:58:51,013
Jack!

567
01:59:21,172 --> 01:59:26,137
He's coming down Fifth Avenue
on schedule.

568
01:59:26,345 --> 01:59:32,226
The power is back on.
Keep quiet, get in the shadows.

569
02:00:14,649 --> 02:00:17,027
No.

570
02:01:15,218 --> 02:01:17,929
Hold on! Close your eyes!

571
02:01:18,137 --> 02:01:22,393
The helicopters are coming
to net him!

572
02:02:07,444 --> 02:02:10,113
Hold on!

573
02:03:30,955 --> 02:03:33,708
Kong...

574
02:04:06,828 --> 02:04:11,584
What are those men doing up there?
Didn't they get my orders?

575
02:05:33,759 --> 02:05:36,388
The rotten bastards!

576
02:05:54,491 --> 02:06:00,916
He's still got the girl. Follow me
in a tight holding pattern.

577
02:06:21,814 --> 02:06:26,069
No! Don't put me down.

578
02:06:26,277 --> 02:06:30,074
Hold on to me.

579
02:06:32,493 --> 02:06:36,289
Hold on to me, or they'll kill you.

580
02:06:43,589 --> 02:06:46,133
Now!

581
02:06:53,809 --> 02:06:56,311
Oh, God.

582
02:07:11,996 --> 02:07:14,416
Wait.

583
02:07:22,258 --> 02:07:24,927
Hold on to me.

584
02:07:25,136 --> 02:07:29,056
Please don't let me go.

585
02:07:41,446 --> 02:07:43,823
Don't kill him!

586
02:07:46,493 --> 02:07:49,038
Don't kill him!

587
02:08:01,552 --> 02:08:04,388
Assholes!

588
02:09:09,796 --> 02:09:12,340
Kong.

589
02:11:01,255 --> 02:11:04,049
Dwan!

590
02:11:04,258 --> 02:11:06,970
Jack!

591
02:11:08,471 --> 02:11:11,558
Jack!
