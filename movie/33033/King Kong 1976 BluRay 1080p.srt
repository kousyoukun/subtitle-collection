1
00:00:55,442 --> 00:01:00,614
- OK Boan, how much you got here?
- About 1,800.

2
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:03,784
- What's going on?
- There's Bagley.

3
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:10,249
Mr. Bagley! Something haywire.
We haven't loaded enough pipe.

4
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:14,336
- Less than 2,000 feet.
- That'll be enough.

5
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:20,634
On Huangatan, it didn't come
until we were past 26,000 feet.

6
00:01:20,843 --> 00:01:24,888
This hole proves out within 2,000,
or it's a write-off.

7
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,287
How are you this evening?

8
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:54,293
All right.

9
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:10,392
The barometer is still falling.
It's a lousy forecast all right.

10
00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:14,271
We should stay here
another 48 hours.

11
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:18,901
Every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island.

12
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:22,196
- I thought only we knew...
- We'll sail right away.

13
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:25,699
You'll be sorry.

14
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:29,661
All right, Mr. Carnahan,
ready to let go.

15
00:02:29,912 --> 00:02:35,918
- Stand by fore and aft.
- OK, haul the gangway ashore!

16
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:13,914
Let it go.

17
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,925
- Roy.
- Fred.

18
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:31,014
Well, here's to the big one.

19
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,744
MAIN TITLE

20
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:02,124
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

21
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:06,962
<i>Mayday.</i>

22
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:26,190
I'm reminded of Amsterdam.

23
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:32,404
Ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream?

24
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:52,174
<i>- Captain here.
- I picked up a mayday call.</i>

25
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:56,595
<i>- It faded before I could get a fix.
- Keep listening.</i>

26
00:06:56,804 --> 00:07:00,307
Let me know if you get anything.

27
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:10,192
Like you said:
"The hell with the weather. "

28
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:18,826
We can get out of this
by backtracking around Timor.

29
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:23,664
- It'll only cost us a few days.
- Keep on course, I'm fine.

30
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:32,297
I gotta admit, for a New York
desk guy, you got a lot of guts.

31
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:36,009
I sold this one to the board.

32
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:41,640
If that island doesn't produce huge,
I'll be wiping windshields.

33
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:59,158
Men.
Carnahan.

34
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:09,418
I'd have told you earlier,
but I couldn't risk any talk.

35
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:17,718
Men, we may be sailing into
the history books. Hit the lights.

36
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:23,807
I believe we're headed for
the biggest oil strike ever.

37
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:27,936
- Here in the magic circle.
- It's magic all right.

38
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:32,483
Are we supposed to find oil
under 2,000 fathoms of sea?

39
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:39,031
Just sea is what the charts say.
Now let's take a look a low angle.

40
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:43,952
This was taken in 1943.

41
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:48,290
This wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph.

42
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,546
No sign of land. Here's a fog bank
you wouldn't look at twice.

43
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:58,050
Let's look at another picture.

44
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:02,304
This is taken from precisely
the same angle.

45
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:06,767
Same area, same fog bank.

46
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:14,858
This was taken two weeks ago.
35 years later.

47
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:20,531
A bank of fog that doesn't change
a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic.

48
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:24,868
Still nothing to explore,
except for one reason.

49
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:29,665
A spy satellite photographed it
by mistake.

50
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:36,171
I got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone.

51
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:40,634
No names, but he lives
on Pennsylvania Ave.

52
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,470
OK, fellas.

53
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:48,267
Roy Bagley, would you take over
and let science make the point?

54
00:09:55,232 --> 00:10:00,821
The satellite was to analyse
exhaust gases from a missile test.

55
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,325
So it was loaded with
two special kinds of film.

56
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:09,288
No, first the infrared.

57
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:15,794
The different colors represent
different surface temperatures.

58
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:19,798
- You mean there's land there?
- Correct, Joe.

59
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:23,927
An island,
hidden by a perpetual fog bank.

60
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:29,224
Never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot.

61
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:35,147
The infrared patterns aren't like
any I've ever seen.

62
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:40,027
More surprising, though, is
what the spectrograph picked up.

63
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:44,239
Chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank.

64
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,412
Free hydrocarbon radicals,
excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide.

65
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:54,666
And, not poisonous
but very damn curious...

66
00:10:54,917 --> 00:11:00,672
This has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground.

67
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:04,927
- Vapors from petroleum deposits.
- Yes!

68
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:11,350
That island is the tip of a huge
underground tankjust waiting for us.

69
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:15,938
- I'm betting everything I've got.
- I'll take 50 cents of that.

70
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:21,360
The excess CO2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration.

71
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,156
- Turn the lights on.
- Animal breathing.

72
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:28,367
Are you crazy?

73
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:34,331
And I'm not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before.

74
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:40,587
In 1605, Fernando De Queres
was blown south from Tenotang.

75
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:46,427
He wrote of the piercing the
white veil. That's the cloud bank.

76
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:50,389
And landing on the beach of the skull,
where he heard the roar -

77
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,685
- of the greatest beast...

78
00:11:54,893 --> 00:12:00,649
The rest of that log entry
was suppressed by Rome.

79
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,946
In 1749, a water-logged lifeboat
was found in the same area.

80
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:12,119
It was empty,
but drawn in blood on the port -

81
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:19,376
- was a likeness of a huge,
slouchy humanoid thing.

82
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,212
And this strange warning:

83
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:28,969
"From thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven, lady, -

84
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:33,640
- God preserve thee. "

85
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:39,938
I also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying Japanese in 1944...

86
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:43,859
What the hell are you talking about?
Who is this joker?

87
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:47,488
- Beats me.
- He's wearing a crew jersey.

88
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:50,532
I'll pay any fair amount
for my... passage.

89
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:53,911
- You're a stowaway?
- Jack Prescott. From Princeton.

90
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:57,247
- Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology.
- You lying hippie!

91
00:12:57,456 --> 00:13:02,252
You're from another oil company!
The meeting's over.

92
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:06,382
He's got one of our T-shirts.

93
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:16,725
This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf
or Exxon can fix a fake passport.

94
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:20,604
- Who the hell are you?
- I am Jack Prescott...

95
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:27,986
My interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil.

96
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:32,366
You're not even a good liar. You
couldn't find out where we're going.

97
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:38,872
- You bought charts!
- Come on. Who'd you pay off?

98
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:46,505
They hadn't sold charts for this area
in years. A friend tipped me.

99
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:51,343
I did pick up
some charts in Surabaya.

100
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:57,474
Take this spy below till he's hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit.

101
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:00,894
Let's go. Come on.

102
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:16,243
- There's something out there.
- Oh, come on!

103
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:20,497
- Honest to God, look!
- Quit horsing around.

104
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,752
Come back here!

105
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:30,007
There's something out there!
About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses.

106
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,136
Son of a bitch, it's a raft!

107
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,994
All stop.

108
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:34,738
She's alive!

109
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:52,339
Gently.

110
00:15:55,342 --> 00:16:00,472
I've had first-aid training, Captain.
Will you all clear out of here?

111
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:03,392
- You have to undress her, huh?
- It's usual.

112
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,896
In case of internal injury
or shock syndrome.

113
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:11,275
- Get outta here!
- Clear out.

114
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:25,289
Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills.

115
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:30,252
There's no sign of
injuries anywhere.

116
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:37,092
C- Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht.

117
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:43,015
- Careless yachtsman, to lose this.
- Remember that mayday call?

118
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:53,734
You can stop sweating. Navy
record's clean, it all checks out.

119
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:57,196
Fingerprints.
The guy's kosher.

120
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:02,743
I know just how to use him, too.

121
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:12,127
The girl's about to come to. She
could be hysterical, so follow me.

122
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:22,096
- Can I get a cheeseburger here?
- You went to medical school, right?

123
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:26,225
What have you got, crystal balls?

124
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:29,478
There's nothing I haven't checked.

125
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:33,440
I know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training.

126
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,070
Now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board.

127
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,743
- You're pretty good with a camera.
- I've snapped a few monkeys.

128
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:50,040
Congratulations.
You're now our official photographer.

129
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:20,738
Hello. Everything's fine.

130
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:25,534
You're safe and well
on an American merchant vessel.

131
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:32,374
Where's Harry and everyone?

132
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:44,636
- You mean they're gone?
- Do you remember anything?

133
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:52,102
No. No.

134
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,861
Yeah...

135
00:19:03,197 --> 00:19:06,450
I was on deck and then...

136
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,206
- Then I was swimming to a star.
- To a light.

137
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:15,959
Let her call it a star.

138
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:21,757
The life-raft was blown over board
near you. It had an automatic flare.

139
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,636
I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge.

140
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:30,015
The yacht didn't get very far
after the SOS.

141
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:36,271
The radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull.

142
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:40,943
We're sorry, ma'am.

143
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:45,906
So am I.

144
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:51,412
Harry had discovered me.

145
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:58,752
He was going to put me in a movie
he was making in Hong Kong.

146
00:19:59,002 --> 00:20:02,089
Dumb luck.

147
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:07,678
But I guess I really can't complain.

148
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:15,018
When you're alone adrift
in the Pacific and somebody just...

149
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:20,357
- Who spotted me, by the way?
- That young fellow.

150
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:27,531
How can I ever thank you?

151
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:34,496
I'm Dwan.

152
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:42,963
D- W-A-N. That's my name.
Like Dawn, -

153
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:49,053
- except that I switched two letters
to make it more memorable.

154
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:54,433
- I'm a mere Jack.
- You must be kidding.

155
00:20:54,683 --> 00:21:00,689
How could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me?

156
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:04,318
You need some rest.

157
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:09,656
I haven't had a good one of those
in years.

158
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:16,413
- Are we headed back to Singapore?
- Not directly, ma'am.

159
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:28,008
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm in no rush.

160
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:36,517
Harry probably wouldn't have
put me in that movie anyhow.

161
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:45,609
Oh, my God!

162
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:52,574
What a meaningful miracle!

163
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:57,204
- I owe my life to a movie.
- Is that so?

164
00:21:57,413 --> 00:22:00,582
I swear to God.

165
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,628
Harry was showing
this film that I refused to watch.

166
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:10,008
That's why I was up on deck
when the yacht exploded.

167
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:16,181
Did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by "Deep Throat"?

168
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,060
Come on, men, let her rest.

169
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:29,653
Maybe my luck has changed.

170
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,981
You know something?

171
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:33,861
I always wondered how Cortes felt
when he first saw the Inca treasure.

172
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:37,906
It was Pizarro,
and he died busted.

173
00:24:57,718 --> 00:25:02,514
Here we go...
Solid land all right.

174
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:08,687
This is its profile east to west.
Typical Pacific formation...

175
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:13,484
This would be the slope at the beach,
the mountainous sector at the west.

176
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,986
Let's get in closer.

177
00:25:18,614 --> 00:25:21,784
- What was that?
- Just a glitch.

178
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:26,163
- False echo off a flock of birds.
- Spot anything unusual?

179
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:30,250
- Not a thing.
- Look at the screen, Fred.

180
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:42,262
All those going ashore,
report to the companionway.

181
00:25:46,975 --> 00:25:50,896
Hi there.
How do you like this for beach wear?

182
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:55,275
Fantastic. I'm afraid
you can't come ashore, though.

183
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:58,737
Wait a minute.

184
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:03,409
You said I could come
on the first boat.

185
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,287
You should wait
till the recon is gone.

186
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:11,291
You want full coverage
of this landing, don't you?

187
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,629
I must be in it. The all-American
girl saved from a yacht -

188
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:19,341
- by "Deep Throat".

189
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:25,556
- Don't print those, I'm married.
- Guaranteed to be on People Magazine.

190
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:29,893
- Printjust one.
- Really, Mr. Wilson...

191
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:34,189
I need a break,
and you owe it to me.

192
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:39,611
Because I am a holder of
a Petrox credit card. I really am!

193
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:42,614
Ask your computer.

194
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:48,996
<i>I may be late on my payments, but
you take 18%% % interest plus charges.</i>

195
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:55,961
Dwan, you come ashore with us.
Captain, she'll come ashore.

196
00:26:56,211 --> 00:27:01,425
Good luck. As soon as you get
through, get on the horn.

197
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:11,226
Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him.
Fred Wilson.

198
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:17,524
I had my horoscope done
before I flew to Hong Kong.

199
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:20,903
- It said that I was...
- Here you go.

200
00:27:22,696 --> 00:27:25,282
It said that I was going to cross
over water -

201
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:29,161
- and meet the biggest person
in my life.

202
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:22,506
That's interesting. The current is
18 degrees cooler than the air.

203
00:28:22,756 --> 00:28:28,011
- What does that mean?
- The fog might lift at the edge.

204
00:28:28,262 --> 00:28:32,391
Crossing 20 fathoms.
Shallowing rapidly.

205
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:41,483
Standing up ahead.
I think I hear breakers.

206
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:03,088
Shore boat to Explorer.
There's a curtain around the island.

207
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:06,175
We just broke through.
There's a beach dead ahead.

208
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:09,845
<i>In two words: No problem.</i>

209
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:16,745
Let me get down! I haven't
touched the ground in weeks.

210
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:27,715
That's good.

211
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:32,344
Jack! I'm coming ashore.

212
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:37,516
Wait, hold it. All right.

213
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,939
Beautiful.

214
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:54,783
Let's start getting a line on this
island. Bring the mosquito spray!

215
00:30:54,992 --> 00:31:01,248
We won't have to start wondering
which way to go.

216
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:05,335
You want to start setting
seismic charges this morning?

217
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:11,175
- Yes. Got to knock the stucture.
- All right, move out!

218
00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:27,191
There's a waterfall ahead!

219
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:30,778
Last one to get in
is a rotten egg.

220
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:18,200
Don't go running off anymore.

221
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:22,746
We'll wait here for them.

222
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,837
Just stick close by me, OK?

223
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:58,008
Holy Mother!
That looks as old as the pyramids.

224
00:33:58,258 --> 00:34:04,515
Could be. But the pyramids
weren't repaired six months ago.

225
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:10,938
There's earth on those timbers. It has
to be replaced after each monsoon.

226
00:34:11,188 --> 00:34:15,401
Are you telling me
there's people here?

227
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:20,072
What's more, I'll characterize them.
Scared people.

228
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,077
- Scared of what?
- I don't exactly what it is.

229
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:31,542
But apparently, they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out.

230
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,254
Let me straighten you out
on a couple of points.

231
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:41,051
One: This wall is an ancient ruin.

232
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:45,848
Two: The island is uninhabited.

233
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:59,194
And three: There's an uninhabited
German beer hall in there.

234
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,030
Let's go.

235
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:18,065
Fred? Look down there.
Take your binoculars.

236
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:23,904
- What?
- Down there, that pool.

237
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:39,420
- Do you think it could be?
- The surface seems viscous.

238
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,589
It sure as hell could be oil.

239
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:48,470
Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller!

240
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:13,829
- Maybe it's a wedding.
- A good guess.

241
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,709
It's scheduled for the night
when the moon's full.

242
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:25,758
Where's the groom?

243
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:38,520
See the one
in the ape mask?

244
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:43,609
You might say
that's the groom's stand-in.

245
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,446
The groom is
on the other side of the wall.

246
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:51,825
You mean it's bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding?

247
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:54,578
Ghastly luck
for the whole congregation.

248
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:26,360
Oh, Christ!

249
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:35,911
You want to talk for us?

250
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,833
I'll try.

251
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:44,294
Shoot in the air only.

252
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:55,556
What's he bitching about?

253
00:38:55,806 --> 00:39:01,478
He's probably telling us we've
contaminated their magic.

254
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:26,879
No.

255
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:36,513
Remember, in the air.

256
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,580
What is it?

257
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,503
He wants to make a deal.
Six of them for Dwan.

258
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:11,465
Tell them that I like him, too,
but not that way.

259
00:40:14,468 --> 00:40:17,388
In the air!

260
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:48,395
- You'll have trouble with the chief.
- I will buy the chief.

261
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:52,316
What have we got
that wogs go for?

262
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:57,237
Radios, pots and pans,
all sorts ofjunk.

263
00:41:57,488 --> 00:42:02,618
This is no longer the 19th century.
You can'tjust grab their island.

264
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:05,788
I'll check that with the UN.
In the meantime -

265
00:42:05,996 --> 00:42:09,083
- we scare them into the boondocks
with a July 4th number.

266
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:12,169
Are your men ready
to set the charges?

267
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:14,671
Kong! Kong!

268
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,510
You heard him chant.
He exists. You saw the wall.

269
00:42:19,718 --> 00:42:22,638
Who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to?

270
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:28,894
It's some nutty religion.
A priest dresses up and gets laid.

271
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:32,648
We'll humor Jack.
Take plenty of TNT.

272
00:42:32,856 --> 00:42:36,527
Any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet, send it bang-bang.

273
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:39,571
- You wouldn't.
- Bet me.

274
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:49,832
Even you wouldn't be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species.

275
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:56,922
The kids would burn every
Petrox gas station in the country.

276
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:13,647
- He could be right.
- Kong, Kong, Kong...

277
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:20,738
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to steal a boat.

278
00:43:20,988 --> 00:43:26,243
- Seriously?
- As soon as I've swiped supplies.

279
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:31,457
- I'm going on a camera hunt.
- That sounds dangerous.

280
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:36,879
It's a chance of a lifetime. You
either grab it or you're dead meat.

281
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:44,178
You shouldn't go ashore tonight.
It's not a good night for Aries.

282
00:43:44,428 --> 00:43:47,765
How did you know I was an Aries?

283
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,520
By the shape of your ears.

284
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:59,318
All right, I asked Fred Wilson.
He knows everything about you.

285
00:43:59,568 --> 00:44:05,574
- I really wish you wouldn't go.
- Is it better to watch an old movie?

286
00:44:05,824 --> 00:44:08,285
There's nothing else to do.

287
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:11,538
Use your imagination.

288
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,170
80 times around the deck
is a mile. We could jog.

289
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:32,601
I guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours.

290
00:44:34,228 --> 00:44:39,358
Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing
in the galley.

291
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:43,445
You'll disappoint me if you're here
when I get back.

292
00:44:43,695 --> 00:44:49,618
- What do you mean?
- I hope you'll wait in your cabin.

293
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:28,073
Here you are, son.
Get it out right away.

294
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:31,160
All right.

295
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:38,333
I said that pool might be oil.
We can't be sure...

296
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:44,381
Think positive. Guys who think
negative don't get far at Petrox.

297
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:49,178
"Has to be the biggest ever.
No problems at all. "

298
00:45:49,428 --> 00:45:55,726
- Well, you're the boss.
- Don't worry about it, Roy.

299
00:54:17,102 --> 00:54:19,521
Help!

300
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:26,695
Help me!

301
00:54:36,914 --> 00:54:39,917
No!

302
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:30,384
We're too late.
Set off the show.

303
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:17,056
- Help him with that bolt.
- Cover the gate.

304
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:22,728
Get on the other side!
Pull!

305
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:30,569
Open that gate!

306
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:39,286
The lights will hold him back!
Don't shoot.

307
00:57:06,897 --> 00:57:10,234
- He's taken her.
- No one's taken her.

308
00:57:10,484 --> 00:57:15,030
Who do you think went through
there, some guy in an ape suit?

309
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:24,832
- You all right?
- I just fell in a Goddamn hole.

310
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,420
No, you didn't.
You're not in a hole.

311
00:57:29,628 --> 00:57:32,631
That's a footprint.

312
00:57:48,439 --> 00:57:54,611
Carnahan here. We've gone over two
miles. There's still no sign of her.

313
00:57:54,862 --> 00:58:00,284
- It's better than finding remains.
- Unless he's gobbled her down.

314
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:05,497
Give me that thing.
Mostjungle apes eat only fruit.

315
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:09,960
Mostjungle apes don't have
a size-90 foot.

316
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:13,714
The men have had it.
I'm going to pitch camp.

317
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:16,967
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
Come on.

318
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:19,803
Keep moving.

319
00:58:23,515 --> 00:58:26,602
Carnahan's right.
It makes more sense to stop.

320
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:30,522
All right, Carnahan.
You know the drill.

321
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:35,069
We'll plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets...

322
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:40,449
- Right, right!
- Will somebody be on the radar?

323
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:49,792
Any large, furry blimp seen moving
in your direction, you'll know.

324
00:58:52,002 --> 00:58:57,257
That footprint measured 6.4 feet.

325
00:58:57,508 --> 00:59:01,553
If that were for real.
How high would that make him?

326
00:59:01,762 --> 00:59:06,141
Multiplied by about eight, I guess.

327
00:59:08,352 --> 00:59:11,105
He'd make a hell of a commercial.

328
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:16,276
"The battles we at Petrox fight
to fill your tank. "

329
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:34,336
If he's not going to eat her,
why did he take her?

330
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:42,469
Apes are very territorial.
He'll probably take her to his turf.

331
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,013
What for?

332
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:49,768
Joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her.

333
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:55,441
- Is that some kind ofjoke or...
- I don't know, Carnahan!

334
00:59:55,691 --> 01:00:01,196
I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking
me so many dumb questions.

335
01:03:01,668 --> 01:03:04,838
I can't stand heights.

336
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:14,973
Honest I can't. When I was ten I got
sick in the Empire State Building.

337
01:03:21,313 --> 01:03:24,733
Put me down!

338
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,657
You put me down!

339
01:03:37,496 --> 01:03:41,625
You put me down!

340
01:03:44,044 --> 01:03:47,840
Put me down.

341
01:03:53,053 --> 01:03:56,640
Please put me down.

342
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:14,825
You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

343
01:04:15,075 --> 01:04:19,538
What are you waiting for?
You wanna eat me?

344
01:04:19,788 --> 01:04:26,754
Then go ahaed! Do it!
Go ahead and eat me!

345
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:31,341
Go ahead! Choke on me!

346
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:42,519
I didn't mean that.
Sometimes I get too physical.

347
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:47,900
It's a sign of insecurity,
like when you knock down trees.

348
01:04:50,736 --> 01:04:57,534
Such a nice ape.
Such a nice, sweet monkey.

349
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,040
We're going to be great friends.

350
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:09,922
I'm a Libra, what sign are you?
No, don't tell me.

351
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:15,094
I'll bet you're an Aries.
Of course you are.

352
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:18,680
I think that's just wonderful.

353
01:06:16,196 --> 01:06:19,199
Help me!

354
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,790
Help me!

355
01:07:16,131 --> 01:07:19,635
Radar had him on the screen.

356
01:07:19,885 --> 01:07:26,850
3.6 kilometres west of your flare.
He moved in a random manner.

357
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:31,605
- Not in our direction?
- Affirmative. Random. Like a circle.

358
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:36,443
Maybe he's lost her. She got away
and he's searching for her.

359
01:07:36,694 --> 01:07:39,780
Carnahan! Wait a minute!

360
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:44,410
<i>- Have you set seismic charges?
- The men are doing it now.</i>

361
01:07:44,618 --> 01:07:48,997
- Don't move until it's finished.
- He's nuts.

362
01:07:49,248 --> 01:07:55,087
The girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turned-on ape.

363
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:59,133
I know how you feel.

364
01:07:59,383 --> 01:08:02,052
But there's an energy crisis.

365
01:08:02,302 --> 01:08:06,932
We must all rise above
our self-interests.

366
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:12,646
- You hypocritical bastard...
- Save your wind, he's signed off.

367
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:15,315
Let's get going.

368
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,777
I ain't busting my ass for no whites.

369
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:24,950
OK. Who gives a shit that
the ape's headed in our direction?

370
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:45,632
- There's Roy.
- Well, Fred...

371
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:49,344
I finished testing the samples
from that pool.

372
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:53,974
- It'll be real great oil!
- Son of a bitch!

373
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:58,103
Fred Wilson is crazy, is he?

374
01:10:58,312 --> 01:11:03,192
Wait till those candy-asses
in New York hear about this.

375
01:11:03,442 --> 01:11:07,654
- I'll grind them...
- Like I said, it will be great oil.

376
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:13,535
As soon as Mother Nature
finishes cooking it a little longer.

377
01:11:13,744 --> 01:11:16,163
How much longer?

378
01:11:16,413 --> 01:11:22,419
Hardly a tick of clock, in geological
terms. Say 10,000 years.

379
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:29,843
Till then you'd get better mileage
filling your Cadillac with mule piss.

380
01:11:32,096 --> 01:11:34,765
Oh, my God!

381
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:40,187
I hate to kick a fella when he's dead,
but I told you.

382
01:11:40,437 --> 01:11:45,567
You shouldn't have told New York
you were bringing in the big one.

383
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:53,200
The big one. Jesus!

384
01:11:55,494 --> 01:12:00,207
Who says I ain't gonna?
Wilson to Explorer.

385
01:12:00,457 --> 01:12:04,211
Get me a channel to Surabaya,
I want an engineer drop.

386
01:12:21,311 --> 01:12:24,148
OK, Jack, you go first.

387
01:12:56,847 --> 01:13:02,436
- Come on, it's solid as a rock.
- OK, let's go.

388
01:13:18,577 --> 01:13:21,997
- Stop firing!
- Jack!

389
01:15:45,516 --> 01:15:48,936
Boan! Try to make it back.

390
01:15:51,897 --> 01:15:55,150
I'm going on.

391
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:28,600
<i>All hands, stand by for recovery.</i>

392
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:51,248
- Over and out.
- Recharge the batteries.

393
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:55,794
- Air drop done, right on target.
- Perfect. Haul your asses.

394
01:16:56,003 --> 01:17:00,049
Get that equipment working.

395
01:17:00,257 --> 01:17:02,885
- You think I'm crazy?
- You said it.

396
01:17:03,093 --> 01:17:08,432
If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon
would be crawling all over here.

397
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,686
Not this one, pal.
Kong is all me and Petrox.

398
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:18,650
A Fred S. Wilson exclusive.
Move your ass, Shorty.

399
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:26,241
You think it'll ring the bell?
Promise oil, bring back a monkey?

400
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:31,914
Look at Exxon's
"We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank".

401
01:17:32,122 --> 01:17:37,586
Beach green to Carnahan.
Report back immediately.

402
01:17:37,795 --> 01:17:41,298
Do nothing to endanger Kong.
Acknowledge.

403
01:17:42,674 --> 01:17:47,930
Carnahan, do you read me?
Do you read me?

404
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:24,341
Give us a hand over here.

405
01:18:30,055 --> 01:18:34,184
Wilson!
Still no contact with Carnahan.

406
01:18:34,393 --> 01:18:38,564
- The radio's not working. No sweat.
- I want to take out a search party.

407
01:18:38,772 --> 01:18:43,944
- I can't spare any men.
- Six guys are cut off in the bush.

408
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:49,742
And you're building monkey traps.
You're playing with their lives.

409
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:52,870
Don't worry about it.

410
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:02,296
Boan!

411
01:19:05,716 --> 01:19:08,802
Where's the others?

412
01:19:48,592 --> 01:19:52,513
Come on, Kong, forget about me.

413
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:58,435
This is never going to work.
Can't you see?

414
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,502
Jack!

415
01:23:51,668 --> 01:23:54,588
We've got to do it.

416
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:57,966
Are you ready?

417
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:30,290
Radar update. Monkey spotted
1,800 yards west by north-west -

418
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:35,838
<i>- heading 0-89,
velocity 2.2 miles per hour.</i>

419
01:24:36,046 --> 01:24:40,759
<i>Estimated time to your position,
five minutes or less.</i>

420
01:24:40,968 --> 01:24:44,972
Kill the lights.
Everybody clear out!

421
01:24:52,771 --> 01:24:59,069
- Logan, how are you doing?
- Almost finished. One minute more.

422
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:07,995
- That's enough.
- All set, Mr. Bagley!

423
01:25:10,664 --> 01:25:15,169
- Ready, Boan?
- OK. It's hot now.

424
01:25:15,377 --> 01:25:20,549
Are you sure that monkey will
be able to bust through that gate?

425
01:25:22,259 --> 01:25:25,596
Pull back the bolt halfway.

426
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:35,898
- Come on.
- I can't.

427
01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:19,066
Open the gate! Help!

428
01:26:21,318 --> 01:26:24,822
- Help!
- Jack!

429
01:26:26,407 --> 01:26:29,576
It's Prescott, open the gate.

430
01:26:46,427 --> 01:26:49,179
Come on!

431
01:27:03,402 --> 01:27:05,821
Close the bolt!

432
01:28:43,252 --> 01:28:47,131
Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing!

433
01:31:41,638 --> 01:31:45,184
Still want to play?

434
01:31:47,144 --> 01:31:51,273
Dwan! Congratulations.

435
01:32:03,452 --> 01:32:06,830
Hey, Jack.
Do I look different?

436
01:32:08,749 --> 01:32:13,545
- Yeah, you shine.
- That's right.

437
01:32:13,754 --> 01:32:16,673
- I'm a star.
- It's all set.

438
01:32:16,882 --> 01:32:22,846
Coast-to-coast tour. We open in
New York. Lights, cameras, Kong!

439
01:32:23,055 --> 01:32:26,266
And probably Nureyev and Fontaine.

440
01:32:26,475 --> 01:32:31,939
I want Balanchine to choreograph
"The Beauty and the Beast".

441
01:32:33,816 --> 01:32:36,694
Any chance of you two
getting married?

442
01:32:36,944 --> 01:32:41,824
I don't know.
This is so sudden.

443
01:32:42,032 --> 01:32:47,454
We could think of some nutty way
of Kong giving away the bride.

444
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:57,798
It'd be tough to get him to do it.
Probably just old-fashioned, huh?

445
01:32:57,965 --> 01:33:02,720
I don't know.
What do you think, Jack?

446
01:33:11,979 --> 01:33:14,398
Christ.

447
01:33:17,693 --> 01:33:24,408
After all these years,
I'll finally end up with a shrink.

448
01:33:31,832 --> 01:33:35,669
How can I become a star
because of someone -

449
01:33:35,878 --> 01:33:41,258
- that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank?

450
01:33:41,467 --> 01:33:47,890
It's not someone. It's an animal
that tried to rape you.

451
01:33:48,098 --> 01:33:52,686
That's not true.
He risked his life to save me.

452
01:33:52,895 --> 01:33:55,647
He tried to rape you, honey.

453
01:33:55,856 --> 01:34:00,152
Ask the natives what they thought
of losing Kong.

454
01:34:00,361 --> 01:34:04,656
- They'll miss him a lot.
- Like leprosy.

455
01:34:04,865 --> 01:34:11,455
You're dead wrong. He was the
terror, the mystery of their lives.

456
01:34:12,748 --> 01:34:17,669
A year from now, the island
will be full of burned-out drunks.

457
01:34:17,878 --> 01:34:22,132
When we took Kong,
we kidnapped their god.

458
01:34:26,095 --> 01:34:29,264
It's like there's a curse
on all of us.

459
01:34:29,473 --> 01:34:32,476
I'm tired of your trying to confuse
this girl.

460
01:34:32,685 --> 01:34:36,397
This is her big chance. And yours.
There's stars at Princeton -

461
01:34:36,605 --> 01:34:41,568
- just like in Hollywood. You want
me to get Kong another keeper?

462
01:34:41,777 --> 01:34:44,905
Coast-to-coast tours?
"Beauty and the Beast"? It's a farce.

463
01:34:45,114 --> 01:34:49,576
Just say the word and your contract
is torn up. Tell me right now.

464
01:34:54,623 --> 01:34:57,543
See you opening night.

465
01:35:10,347 --> 01:35:14,601
Oh, God,
I'm tired of thinking.

466
01:35:26,947 --> 01:35:31,994
- The ape had the right idea.
- What's that?

467
01:36:42,523 --> 01:36:45,651
Wait a minute.

468
01:36:49,029 --> 01:36:51,990
I'll be right back.

469
01:37:38,996 --> 01:37:42,458
<i>All hands on deck!</i>

470
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:50,966
<i>Fire detaiI,
report to the controI room.</i>

471
01:37:54,595 --> 01:37:58,724
<i>This is the captain.
Sea water pumps to full pressure.</i>

472
01:37:58,932 --> 01:38:03,562
<i>Prepare to flood tank No. 4.
I"m ordering the ape drowned.</i>

473
01:38:07,066 --> 01:38:11,403
Hey, Kong! Here I am.

474
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:21,705
Do you remember me?
Remember your blind date?

475
01:38:21,914 --> 01:38:24,958
You haven't forgotten, have you?

476
01:38:33,676 --> 01:38:38,847
Dwan! Come back here!
He's going berserk.

477
01:38:39,056 --> 01:38:43,227
- Stop, or I'll jump.
- Dwan, please.

478
01:38:43,435 --> 01:38:48,023
- You can't help him now.
- Don't come any closer.

479
01:38:48,232 --> 01:38:50,776
OK.

480
01:38:53,404 --> 01:38:59,368
Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up
all these people?

481
01:38:59,576 --> 01:39:04,873
No one's going to hurt you.
You're just going to be a star.

482
01:39:13,966 --> 01:39:18,262
Don't flood the tank! She fell in.

483
01:41:26,432 --> 01:41:29,226
You could've...

484
01:42:30,537 --> 01:42:34,500
Jack! I'm so glad to see you.

485
01:42:37,461 --> 01:42:43,092
- What is it? You're not dressed.
- That's right.

486
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:47,805
I was wrong when I called this
thing a farce, it's a tragedy.

487
01:42:48,013 --> 01:42:53,352
- I'm quitting your circus, Fred.
- You signed a contract.

488
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:56,480
- You took an advance.
- I donated it in your name.

489
01:42:56,689 --> 01:43:02,152
To the SPCA Fund for Sending
Kong Home. Here's your receipt.

490
01:43:02,361 --> 01:43:07,282
- Sue me.
- Don't leave me tonight, please.

491
01:43:07,491 --> 01:43:11,620
- My horoscope says...
- Shut up. I love you.

492
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:20,796
Come with me right now.
The hell with the contract.

493
01:43:21,004 --> 01:43:25,968
Go ahead. But I promise you
you'll never get another booking.

494
01:43:26,176 --> 01:43:30,139
You'll end up tap-dancing
at rotary clubs.

495
01:43:32,599 --> 01:43:37,813
- Don't you understand?
- Yeah...

496
01:43:38,022 --> 01:43:42,693
I do. Sorry.

497
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:48,574
Stay well.

498
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:15,267
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of our TV-satellite audience, -</i>

499
01:44:15,476 --> 01:44:19,313
<i>- you are seeing this
live around the world-</i>

500
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:25,194
<i>- as it is happening
here in New York City.</i>

501
01:44:25,402 --> 01:44:32,201
<i>You have better seats than these
lucky King Kong contest winners.</i>

502
01:44:53,347 --> 01:44:59,103
Thus, Beauty set foot on the
forbidden island and was seized.

503
01:44:59,311 --> 01:45:02,690
Great was the fear
as Beauty was lashed -

504
01:45:02,898 --> 01:45:07,945
- to the dreadful bridal altar
of the Beast.

505
01:45:08,153 --> 01:45:12,116
Now the earth booms.

506
01:45:46,316 --> 01:45:51,488
Kong's power!
Superpower!

507
01:45:53,574 --> 01:45:56,744
Hail the power!

508
01:46:29,985 --> 01:46:35,449
That's the power of Kong,
and Petrox!

509
01:46:47,461 --> 01:46:50,297
No! Don't push her around!

510
01:46:58,764 --> 01:47:02,601
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to fear!

511
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:09,358
That is an escape-proof cage
certified by the city government.

512
01:47:33,132 --> 01:47:37,219
Come on out! Easy.

513
01:47:37,428 --> 01:47:41,098
His feet are still chained.

514
01:47:42,558 --> 01:47:46,520
It's all right. Come on.

515
01:49:45,222 --> 01:49:47,725
We're in position.

516
01:49:47,933 --> 01:49:52,771
The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned
up. What's the situation at Brooklyn?

517
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:57,151
<i>I"II tell that monkey to spread
before he crosses it.</i>

518
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:03,115
Come on, there's a train coming.

519
01:52:04,695 --> 01:52:07,239
Hit the lights.

520
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:27,051
<i>This is a message to all traffic.</i>

521
01:52:27,259 --> 01:52:31,221
<i>Clear all streets.
Proceed to shelters.</i>

522
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:38,896
<i>Repeating: Clear all streets. Any
person found looting will be shot.</i>

523
01:52:56,997 --> 01:52:59,875
Keep running.

524
01:53:00,084 --> 01:53:04,922
Jack! Buy me a drink, will you?

525
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:08,050
Come on, buy me a drink.

526
01:53:08,258 --> 01:53:12,388
Ten more blocks and we've got
the key to a great apartment.

527
01:53:12,596 --> 01:53:15,516
We've put a river between us.

528
01:53:15,724 --> 01:53:20,145
The bridges are mined, and apes
don't swim. Your book says so.

529
01:53:20,354 --> 01:53:26,110
Please, buy me a drink.
Buy me a drink over there.

530
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:30,906
OK.

531
01:53:34,284 --> 01:53:37,246
What's the matter?

532
01:53:37,454 --> 01:53:43,001
Déj?vu. I don't know where,
but I've seen this view before.

533
01:54:17,494 --> 01:54:20,664
Here.

534
01:54:20,873 --> 01:54:24,668
We don't want to get shot as looters.

535
01:54:24,877 --> 01:54:29,256
OK, get smashed.

536
01:54:29,465 --> 01:54:34,511
How about that nice offer
you made me? Do you still want me?

537
01:54:37,473 --> 01:54:43,479
Look, chinchilla.
Looks great on you.

538
01:54:43,687 --> 01:54:48,734
I asked you a question.

539
01:54:48,942 --> 01:54:52,780
- You know what I earn?
- Do you think I need furs?

540
01:54:52,988 --> 01:54:59,203
Yes. Excitement is in your blood
like dope.

541
01:55:00,913 --> 01:55:05,667
You're going to need new fixes
I'm not able to give you.

542
01:55:05,876 --> 01:55:09,213
Don't be stupid.

543
01:55:46,542 --> 01:55:49,336
It's OK.

544
01:55:51,255 --> 01:55:56,719
Probably some National Guardsman
ran his tank into a powerhouse.

545
01:55:56,927 --> 01:56:00,097
Do you remember that black-out?

546
01:56:00,305 --> 01:56:05,728
And all the babies born
exactly nine months later?

547
01:56:05,936 --> 01:56:10,774
Well, here's to all the future
sons and daughters of King Kong.

548
01:56:11,984 --> 01:56:15,029
I'll drink to that.

549
01:56:17,531 --> 01:56:24,288
The hell with furs. Tell me,
does that nice offer still stand?

550
01:56:26,081 --> 01:56:32,838
It depends on Kong. He's bigger
than both of us, know what I mean?

551
01:56:33,047 --> 01:56:35,841
Don't tease me, I'm serious.

552
01:56:41,764 --> 01:56:45,809
Of course. I know
where I've seen that view before.

553
01:56:59,073 --> 01:57:03,952
I think we've got a chance. Sit tight,
I've got to make a phone call.

554
01:57:05,371 --> 01:57:09,124
Keep it down, everyone.

555
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:13,337
What do you think?
Is he flipped out or not?

556
01:57:13,545 --> 01:57:18,175
Hello? Hello...

557
01:57:18,384 --> 01:57:22,012
Excuse me, Professor. You say
you know where Kong is headed.

558
01:57:22,221 --> 01:57:25,849
Yes.
You can trap him without danger.

559
01:57:26,058 --> 01:57:30,521
Get some helicopters and
blasting nets on top of him.

560
01:57:30,729 --> 01:57:36,026
No problem. Where is he headed,
Professor Prescott?

561
01:57:36,235 --> 01:57:41,990
Promise me to capture him
without injury and I'll tell you.

562
01:57:51,166 --> 01:57:55,462
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Professor.

563
01:57:55,671 --> 01:57:58,173
Where is Kong heading?

564
01:57:58,382 --> 01:58:04,054
A place in Manhattan that looks
exactly like his natural habitat.

565
01:58:04,263 --> 01:58:08,600
Let him climb to the top of
the World Trade Center.

566
01:58:47,931 --> 01:58:50,851
Jack!

567
01:59:21,048 --> 01:59:26,011
He's coming down Fifth Avenue
on schedule.

568
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:32,101
The power is back on.
Keep quiet, get in the shadows.

569
02:00:14,518 --> 02:00:16,895
No.

570
02:01:15,079 --> 02:01:17,790
Hold on! Close your eyes!

571
02:01:17,998 --> 02:01:22,252
The helicopters are coming
to net him!

572
02:02:07,297 --> 02:02:09,967
Hold on!

573
02:03:30,798 --> 02:03:33,550
Kong...

574
02:04:06,667 --> 02:04:11,422
What are those men doing up there?
Didn't they get my orders?

575
02:05:33,587 --> 02:05:36,215
The rotten bastards!

576
02:05:54,316 --> 02:06:00,739
He's still got the girl. Follow me
in a tight holding pattern.

577
02:06:21,635 --> 02:06:25,889
No! Don't put me down.

578
02:06:26,098 --> 02:06:29,893
Hold on to me.

579
02:06:32,312 --> 02:06:36,108
Hold on to me, or they'll kill you.

580
02:06:43,407 --> 02:06:45,951
Now!

581
02:06:53,625 --> 02:06:56,128
Oh, God.

582
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:14,229
Wait.

583
02:07:22,071 --> 02:07:24,740
Hold on to me.

584
02:07:24,948 --> 02:07:28,869
Please don't let me go.

585
02:07:41,256 --> 02:07:43,634
Don't kill him!

586
02:07:46,303 --> 02:07:48,847
Don't kill him!

587
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:04,196
Assholes!

588
02:09:09,595 --> 02:09:12,139
Kong.

589
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:03,834
Dwan!

590
02:11:04,043 --> 02:11:06,754
Jack!

591
02:11:08,255 --> 02:11:11,342
Jack!
