00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,860
15年前
15 years ago.

144
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,850
可知那些时候他身在何处?
Any idea where he's been all that time?

145
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,230
我常常想他是死了 让事情更简单\NI like to think he's dead, makes things easier.

146
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,920
比什么简单?他被当成一个帝国战争机器的工具?
Easier than what? That he's being a tool of the Imperial war machine?

147
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,900
我对各种政见从未有过奢望真的?
I've never had the luxury of political opinions. Really?

148
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,910
你最后一次联系索•格雷拉是什么时候?
When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera?

149
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,630
那已有很长一段时间\NIt's been a long time.

150
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,870
他还记得你 还是 忘了?
He'd remember you, though, wouldn't he?

151
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,260
他可能同意见你 如果你作为朋友去
He might agree to meet you, if you came as a friend.

152
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,230
我们在此分秒必争 孩子 如果没啥可谈
We're up against the clock here, girl, So if there's nothing to talk about

153
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,880
我们只需把你送还原处
we'll just put you back where we found you.

154
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,780
我还是小孩时 索•格雷拉救过我的命\NI was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life.

155
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,660
他救出我 但是我不知他在哪儿我有些年没看到他了
He raised me. But I've no idea where he is. I haven't seen him in years.

156
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,520
我们知道怎么找到他 那不是我们的问题
We know how to find him, that's not our problem.

157
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,590
我们需要的是一个带我们入门而不被杀掉的人\NWhat we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed.

158
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,350
你们都是反抗军 是吗?
You're all rebels, aren't you?

159
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,450
是的 但索•格雷拉是一个极端分子\NYes, but Saw Gerrera's an extremist.

160
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,570
他一直都在为自己战斗从他脱离了反抗军以来
He's been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion.

161
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,190
他的战斗给联盟带来了很多问题
His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems.

162
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,460
我们别无选择 只得尝试修复打破的信任\NWe have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust.

163
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,930
这跟我父亲又有什么关系?
What does this have to do with my father?

164
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,880
有个帝国反叛者在杰达一个飞行员
There's an Imperial defector in Jedha. A pilot.

165
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,790
他被索•格雷拉绑架
He's being held by Saw Gerrera.

166
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:34,970
他声称皇帝正在制造一个有能力摧毁整个行星的武器\NHe's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets.

167
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,080
飞行员说他是受你父亲派遣
The pilot says he was sent by your father.

168
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,140
我们需要在武器完成前阻止它
We need to stop this weapon before it is finished.

169
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,480
安多上尉的任务是证实飞行员的故事 之后 如有可能 找到你父亲\NCaptain Andor's mission is to authenticate the pilot's story and then, if possible, find your father.

170
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,180
看来他对这个超级武器的开发至关重要\NIt appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon.

171
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,910
考虑到情况的严重性及你跟索的渊源
Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw,

172
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,810
我们希望他能帮我们找到你父亲再让他返回参议院作证
we're hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony.

173
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,770
如果我做了?
And if I do it?

174
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,140
我们会确保你自由
We'll make sure you go free.

175
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,770
安多上尉!
Captain Andor!

176
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,980
我是克图偶\NI'm Kay-Tuesso (K-2SO)

177
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,730
我是一个重编程帝国机器人\NI'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.

178
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,210
我记得你
I remember you.

179
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,990
我看委员会是派你跟我们一起去杰达
I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha.

180
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,420
很显然\NApparently so.

181
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,400
这是个坏主意
That is a bad idea.

182
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,480
我认为是 卡西安也认为是\NI think so, and so does Cassian.

183
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,380
我怎么知道?我的专业就是战略分析
What do I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis.

184
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,380
盖伦•厄索对帝国的武器计划至关重要\NGalen Erso is vital to the Empire's weapon program.

185
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,340
忘记你在那里听到的 不用汇报
Forget what you heard in there, there will be no extraction.

186
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,790
你找到他 你杀了他
You find him You kill him.

187
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,480
然后又当场\NThen and there.

188
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,600
你见过克图了?
You met Kay-Tu?

189
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,080
迷人
Charming.

190
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,290
他倾向于电脑里冒出啥就说啥
He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits.

191
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,190
这是重编程的副产品\NIt's a by-product of the reprogram.

192
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,900
为什么她有冲击波而我没有?
Why does she get a blaster, and I don't?

193
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,190
什么?我知道怎么用\NWhat. I know how to use it.

194
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,100
那正是我所担心的 把它给我
That's what I'm afraid of. Give it to me.

195
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,490
我们要去杰达那可是战区\NWe're going to Jedha. That's a war zone.

196
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,160
这不是重点\NThat's not the point.

197
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,500
你哪里拿的?我找到的
Where did you get it?I found it.

198
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,570
我发现这回复含糊且不可信
I find that answer vague and unconvincing.

199
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,810
信任是互相的
Trust goes both ways.

200
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,480
你就让她留着它?
You're letting her keep it?

201
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,010
你想知道她用它对付你的概率吗?
Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you?

202
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,470
很高让我们出发吧
It's high. Let's get going.

203
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,380
非常高\NIt's very high.

204
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,760
谎言!
Lies!

205
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,940
欺骗!
Deceptions!

206
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,510
让我们看看\NLet's see it.

207
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,170
菩提•鲁克货物飞行员
Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot.

208
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,830
本地人 呵呵?嗯-哼\NLocal boy, huh? Uh-huh.

209
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
这是从他的靴子里找到的 当他被抓到的时候\NThis was found in his boot when he was captured.

210
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,490
好的 我能听见你\NOkay, I can hear you.

211
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,950
他没有抓住我 我自己来的\NHe didn't capture me, I came here myself.

212
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,590
我叛逃 我叛逃\NI defected, I defected.

213
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,290
每一天 更多谎言
Every day, more lies.

214
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,730
谎言?
Lies?

215
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,280
我会为谎言不顾一切?不 我们没时间这样!
Would I risk everything for a lie? No, we don't have time for this!

216
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,910
我得跟索•格雷拉谈谈 在一切太迟之前\NI have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it's too late.

217
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,680
好吧…\NOkay. . .

218
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,850
那 你…\NSo, you. . .

219
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,760

220
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,660
哦. 那个-那个是给你的
Uh. That's-That's for you.

221
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,400
而我把它给他们 他们却没发现
And I gave it to them, they did not find it!

222
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,950
我把它给他们
I gave it to them.

223
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,710
盖伦•厄索\NGalen Erso.

224
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,430
他叫我找你\NHe told me to find you.

225
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,440
博尔•格莱特
Bor Gullet.

226
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,410
博尔•格莱特?
Bor Gullet?

227
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,550
盖伦•厄索派我来!
Galen Erso sent me!

228
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,700
他叫我找到你!
He told me to find you!

229
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,580
最不幸的是杰达的安全漏洞 主管克伦尼克
Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha, Director Krennic.

230
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,720
经过这么多的挫折和延误 现在又这样\NAfter so many setbacks and delays, and now this.

231
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,250
我们听到谣言在城里流传\NWe've heard word of rumors circulating through the city.

232
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,410
显然你失去了一位相当健谈的货运飞行员\NApparently you've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot.

233
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,440
如果参议院得到我们项目的风声 无数的系统将集结于反抗军
If the Senate gets wind of our project, countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.

234
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:55,360
一旦战斗空间站完工 总督塔金 参议院就会很少关注\NWhen the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin, the Senate will be of little concern.

235
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,880
一旦已成现在 主管克伦尼克皇帝决不容许再拖延\NWhen has become now, Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay,

236
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,850
你已让时间成为反抗军的盟友\Nyou have made time an ally of the Rebellion.

237
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:11,880
我建议 我们同时解决这两个问题 通过直接测试武器
I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon.

238
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,890
失败将会找到你要一个耐心不足的观众的原因
Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience.

239
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,770
我不会失败\NI will not fail.

240
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,940
怎么了 琴?你看起来很害怕\NWhat's the matter, Jyn? You looked frightened.

241
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,710
我会永远保护你\NI'll always protect you.

242
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,990
星尘
Stardust.

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,030
永远不会改变
Don't ever change.

244
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,600
相信…\NTrust. . .

盖伦
Galen.

246

我们即将进入轨道你来操控
We're coming into orbit. You have controls.

247
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,430
那就是杰达\NThat's Jedha.

248
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,800
它还剩下些什么\NOr what's left of it.

249
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,470
我们要找索 我们要找你父亲\NWe find Saw, we find your father.

250
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,510
驱逐舰在这里干什么?
What's with the Destroyer?

251
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,820
这都是因为你的老朋友 索•格雷拉
It's because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera.

252
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,590
他一直在袭击货物运输
He's been attacking the cargo shipments.

253
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
他们带什么来了?
What are they bringing in?

254
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,580
其实是"他们带什么走了"?
It's 'what are they taking out?'

255
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,030
凯伯水晶所有能带走的\NKyber crystal. All they can get.

256
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,440
我们想知其为何拆圣殿 现在知道了\NWe wondered why they were stripping the temple, now we know.

257
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,800
那是武器的燃料\NIt's the fuel for the weapon.

258
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,140
你父亲建造的武器
The weapon your father's building.

259
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,620
也许我们应该把靶子留下\NMaybe we should leave target practice behind.

260
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,870
你在说我吗?
Are you talking about me?

261
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,710
她说得对
She's right.

262
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,980
我们要混进去留在飞船里\NWe need to blend in. Stay with the ship.

263
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,610
我可以混进去我是帝国机器人\NI can blend in. I'm an Imperial droid.

264
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,390
此城被帝国占领\NThis city is under Imperial occupation

265
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,670
这里半数人想把你重新编程另一半想在你的头上打个洞
Half the people here want to reprogram you. The other half want to put a hole in your head.

266
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,620
我很惊讶你是如此关心我的安全
I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.

267
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,960
我可没有 我只是担心他们可能惦记你而打我\NI'm not. I'm just worried they might miss you and hit me.

268
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,060
听起来对我不算太坏\NDoesn't sound so bad to me.

269
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,520
博尔•格莱特能感觉到你的想法
Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts,

270
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,150
没有谎言就安全\NNo lie is safe.

271
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,480
你给我真正带了什么 货运飞行员?
What have you really brought me, cargo pilot?

272
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,890
博尔•格莱特会知道真象\NBor Gullet will know the truth.

273
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,260
令人遗憾的副作用
The unfortunate side effect,

274
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,510
就是人们常常失去自己的意识不
is that one tends to lose one's mind. No.

275

跟那个杀了我们的人的家伙说去
Tell that to the one who killed our men.

人们会想要-拿你当人质\NPeople who wanted to-to use you as a hostage.

你来这里只为杀我?
Did you come here to kill me?

415
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,000
我时日不多\NThere's not much of me left.

416
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,300
联盟想要我父亲\NThe Alliance wants my father.

417
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,220
他们认为他有给过你一个武器的消息
They think he's sent you a message about a weapon.

418
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,980

419
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,480
那你想要的又是什么 琴?
So what is it that you want, Jyn?

420
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,980
他们想要个介绍人 他们如愿了\NThey wanted an introduction, they've got it.

421
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:52,570
我现在退出你接下来想干啥就干啥\NI'm out now. The rest of you can do what you want.

422
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,060
你不关心原因?

423

原因?
The cause?

00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,610
严肃地?
Seriously?

425
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,540
联盟?
The Alliance?
The. . .

反抗军?不管它是啥 那些日子你以此为名?

427
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,720
所有这些带给我只是痛苦
All it's ever brought me is pain.

428
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:14,990
你能袖手旁观帝国的旗帜插满银河系?
You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?

429
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,580
这不是问题 如果你不仰望
It's not a problem if you don't look up.

430
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,070

皇帝在等着我的汇报
The Emperor is awaiting my report.

433
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,520
他曾希望和勋爵维达于此共赏难得盛况\NOne had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion.

00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,210
而我认为此举可谨慎地拯救你于任何潜在的尴尬中
And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.

435
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,630
你的担忧完全没必要\NYour concern is hardly warranted.

436
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,640
说到就要做到
If saying it would only make it so.

437
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:03,430
所有帝国军队都撤离了 我就会摧毁整个伴星\NAll Imperial forces, have been evacuated, and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.

438
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,790
那不是必须的我们需要一个声明 而非一个宣言
That won't be necessary. We need a statement, not a manifesto.

439
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,580
对这天来说 圣城已经足够
The Holy City will be enough for the day.

目标杰达之城 准备单核反应堆点火\NTarget Jedha City, prepare single reactor ignition.

你是飞行员?

00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,620
嘿 嘿—你是飞行员?太空飞行员?

索 如果你正在看这个

那么也许就有机会拯救联盟

也许有一个机会来解释我自己 虽然我不敢奢望太多\NPerhaps there's a chance to explain myself and, though I don't dare hope for too much,

468
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:57,200
一个给琴的机会 如果她还活着

让她知道

我对她的爱从未褪色 我是多么强烈地想念她

472
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,360
琴 我的星尘
Jyn, my Stardust,

473
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,870
我无法料想你对我的想法\NI can't imagine what you think of me.

474
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,770
当我被带走时 我得面对那些痛苦事实
When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths.

475
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,570
我被告知 很快 克伦尼克也会抓到你\NI was told that, soon enough, Krennic would have you as well.

As time went by, I knew that you were either dead

477
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,180
要么隐藏得如此好 他永远找不到你\Nor so well hidden that he would never find you.

478

我知道如果我拒绝工作

479
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,800
如果我夺走我自己的生命 那只是一个时间问题\Nif I took my own life, it would only be a matter of time

480
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,730
在克伦尼克意识到他不再需要我去完成项目之前\Nbefore Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project.

481
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,980
所以我做了一件没人期望的事：我撒谎了
So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied.

482
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,890
我学会了撒谎

483
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:49,130
我扮演成被挫败的借工作逃避的人的一员\NI played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work.

484
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,090
我让自己不可缺少

485
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,380
我一直在打造我的复仇基础
and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge.

486
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,910
我们称之为死星\NWe call it the Death Star.

487
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,360
没有更好的名称\NThere is no better name.

488
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,180
而这一天必将很快来到 一旦它被释放\NAnd the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed.

489
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,050
我已在系统里面设置了一个弱点\NI've placed a weakness deep within the system.

490
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,990
一个如此小而强大的缺陷 他们永远也找不到
A flaw so small and powerful, they'll never find it.

491
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,740

只有在我坚强的时刻 我才尽力想你
I try to think of you only in the moments when I'm strong,

494
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,520
因为那些没有你在我身边的痛苦…\NBecause the pain of not having you with me…

495
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,990
你的母亲

496
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,810
我们一家人

497
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,210
这些失去的痛苦是如此压倒一切 即使现在我也可能失败
The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now.

498
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,760
这是如此之难如不想你
It's just so hard not to think of you.

499
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:37,660
想着你在哪里

索 反应堆模块 这是关键

那是我埋设机关的地方
That's the place I've laid my trap.

503
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,840
它很隐蔽且不稳定
It's well hidden and unstable,

504
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,610
击中它的任何部分都会摧毁整个空间站\None blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station.

505
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,570
你需要蓝图\NYou'll need the plans,

506
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,720
死星的结构蓝图以找到反应堆\Nthe structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor.

00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,220
我会禀呈他 我会接管控制这武器\NI will tell him, that I will be taking control over the weapon

550
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,140
我几年前第一次说的话… 立即生效

我们站在这里之际 我的成就—不是你的!
We stand here amid my achievement—Not yours!

552
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:01,130
我担心最近的这些安全漏洞已经暴露了你作为一个军事总监的不足之处\NI'm afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.

553
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,630
漏洞已经补上
The breaches have been filled,

554
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,860
杰达已经沉寂
Jedha has been silenced.

555
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,050
你以为那个飞行员单独行动?
You think this pilot acted alone?

556
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,900
他是从伊杜的基地派出的\NHe was dispatched from the installation on Eadu.

557
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:15,380
盖伦•厄索的设施
Galen Erso's facility.

558
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,580
我们得去查查这个
We'll see about this.

559
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,600
一条加密信息来自安多上尉 长官
A coded message from Captain Andor, sir.

560
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,990
武器确认杰达被毁

561
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,730
任务目标位于伊杜请指示\NMission target located on Eadu. Please advise.

562
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,380
被毁了?

563
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,710
继续

564

告诉他我的命令仍然有效\NTell him my orders still stand.

565
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:50,170
告诉他行动要快 按计划行事\NTell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan.

566
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,780
我们不知道他为帝国建造的是什么\NWe have no idea what he is building for the Empire.

567
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,920
我们必须杀掉盖伦•厄索 趁我们有机会
We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance.

568
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:09,000

设置航线到伊杜\NSetting course for Eadu.

575
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,620
我父亲就在哪儿?
Is that where my father is?

576
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,950
我觉得是
I think so.

577
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,990
你就是盖伦的女儿
So you're Galen's daughter.

578
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,290
你认识他?
You know him?

579
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,100
我是菩提 飞行员\NI'm Bodhi, the pilot.

580
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,560
你带了消息\NYou brought the message.

581
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,060
是的 你父亲…\NYes, your father. . .

582
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,800
他说我靠自己可以做好
He said I could get right by myself.

583
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,920
他说我可以做好 如果我足够勇敢\NHe said I could make it right, if I was brave enough

584
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,110
要倾听心中所想\Nand listened to what was in my heart.

585
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,520
为之行动
Do something about it.

586
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,200
估计来不及了
Guess it was too late.

587
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,450
还不算太迟\NIt wasn't too late.

588
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:16,010
似乎于我已相当晚了\NSeems pretty late to me.

589
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,420
不\NNo.

590
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,200
我们可以打败那些坏事的人
We can beat the people who did this.

591
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,940
我父亲的消息 我已看过
My father's message, I've seen it.

592
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,650
他们称之为死星\NThey call it the Death Star.

593
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,310
但是他们不知道有方法可战胜它
But they have no idea there's a way to defeat it.

594
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,480
你们误解了我父亲
You're wrong about my father.

595
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,250
他确实建造了它因为他知他们仍会造好就算不靠他\NHe did build it. Because he knew they'd do it without him.

596
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,790
我的父亲做了一个选择
My father made a choice.

597
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,380
他为反抗军牺牲了自己
He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion.

598
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,030
他在里面埋设了一个机关\NHe's rigged a trap inside it

599
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,620
那就是他派你来的原因为带出这消息
That's why he sent you. To bring that message.

600
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,170

消息在哪儿?
Where's the message?

602
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,960
那是个全息影像\NIt was a hologram.

603
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,880
你有那消息 对吗?
You have that message, right?

604
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,760
所有的事发生得太快

你看过它?
Did you see it?

606
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,690
你不相信我\NYou don't believe me.

607
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,820
我可不是你要说服的人
I'm not the one you've got to convince.

608
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:15,690
我相信她
I believe her.

609
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,630
承蒙告知
That's good to know.

610
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,570
什么样的机关?
What kind of trap?

611
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,840
你说过你父亲造了个机关\NYou said your father made a trap.

612
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,860
反应堆\NThe reactor

613
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,930
他放置了一个弱点在那里他把它隐藏了很多年\NHe's placed a weakness there. He's been hiding it for years.

614
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:30,300
他说只要你能攻击反应堆-模块-整个系统就会崩溃
He said if you can blow the reactor-the modulethe whole system goes down.

615
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,780
你需要发消息给联盟\NYou need to send word to the Alliance.

616
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:33,840
我已经发了\NI've done that.

617
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,120
他们必须知道有办法能摧毁这东西\NThey have to know there's a way to destroy this thing.

618
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,660
他们必须去斯卡里夫拿到蓝图我不能冒这个险
They have to go to Scarif to get the plans. I can't risk sending that.

619
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,250
我们在帝国势力范围的中心
We're in the heart of Imperial territory.

620
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,280
那么我们就要找到他再带他回来
Then we'll find him. And bring him back,

621
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,540
他就能亲自告诉他们\Nand he can tell them himself.

622
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,290
航线设往伊杜 长官
Course set for Eadu, sir.

623
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,000
伊杜 帝国凯伯水晶精炼厂\NEADU IMPERIAL KYBER REFINERY

624
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,060
我与原力同在 原力与我同在
I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.

625
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,050
二十度转右\N20 egress to the right.

626

十度向上

不 不 不 低些低些!
No, no, no, lower. Lower!

628
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,840
你确定是这条路?
Are you sure this is the way?

629
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,990
他们有落地跟踪器他们有巡逻中队\NThey have landing trackers. They have patrol squadrons.

630
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,170
你必须穿行峡谷 保持低飞
You've got to stay in the canyon, keep it low.

631
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,060

632
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,900
有百分之二十六的失败机率
There's a 26% chance of failure.

633
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,030
还有多远?

634
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,830
我不知道我不确定 我从未真的飞这条路\NI don't know. I'm not sure, I never really come this way,

635
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,550
不过我们很近了 我们很近了我知道的\Nbut we're close, we're close. I know that.

636

00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,440
我理解\NI understand.

638
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,590
马上!马上停下!有风…\NNow! Put it down now!The wind. . .

639
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,530
如果你继续走 你就会飞过穿梭机库右侧\NIf you keep going, you'll be right over the shuttle depot.

640
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,120

再试下在试 长官我们…\NTry them again. I am, sir. We. . .

643
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:33,700
信号消失了\NThe signal's gone dead.

644
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,030
中队集合 目标伊杜

645
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,570
现在如何?检查稳定装置?

646
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,980
菩提 实验室在哪儿?研究机构?

648
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,990
它就在山脊上
It's just over the ridge.

649
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,250
我们正前方那个机库?你确定是它?

650
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,190
是的

651
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,910
我们必须期望还有一艘帝国飞船留下可偷\NWe'll have to hope there's still an Imperial ship left to steal.

652
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,210
我们要这样去干\NHere's what we're doing.

653
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,280
唯愿风暴继续 掩藏我们于此处\NHopefully, the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here.

654

菩提 你跟我来

我们爬上山脊看看

你是信使
You're the messenger.

659
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,620
真是可笑我们都得到了消息在此人人皆知
That's ridiculous. We all got the message. Everyone here knows it.

660
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,730
一发击中反应堆模块则整个系统垮掉\NOne blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down.

661

快去修我们的通讯器!

此刻我全部想做的就是掌控我们所要面对的问题
All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we're up against.

664
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:41,960
所以 我们要非常轻微且非常小心地到山脊上看看有些什么\NSo, we're going to go very small and very carefully up the rise and see what's what.

665
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,310
我们出去吧\NLet's get out of here.

666
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,100
他看上去象个凶手?
Does he look like a killer?

667
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:02,010
不他有一张朋友脸

668

你在说谁?

669
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,990
安多上尉

Why do you ask that? What do you mean, does he look like a killer?

671
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:13,810
原力接近一个即将杀人的生物会变得黑暗\NThe Force moves darkly near a creature that's about to kill.

672
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:18,400
他的武器是狙击配置\NHis weapon was in the sniper configuration.

673

别 别 别…我们必须上去\NNo, no, no…We got to go up.

675
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,560
走这边\NThis way.

01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,630
我要跟着琴她的路很清晰\NI'm going to follow Jyn. Her path is clear.

680

一个人?祝好运!

681
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,980
我不需要好运 我有你!
I don't need luck, I have you!

682
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:47,840
他们这是干嘛?
What are they doing?

683
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,930
如果卡西安回来 我们会不等他们就离开
If Cassian comes back, we're leaving without them.

684
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,290
你看见厄索从那儿出来?
You see Erso out there?

685
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,740

我们真的是在谈论解散我们辛辛苦苦创建的东西吗?
Are we really talking about disbanding something that we've worked so hard to create?

826
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,450
我们不能只是屈服我们加入了一个联盟 而不是一个自杀协议!
We can't just give in. We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact!

827
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,790
我们现在才设法集结我们的部队集结我们的部队?
We've only now managed to gather our forces. Gather our forces?

828
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,840
德雷文将军已经炸毁一个帝国空间站!
General Draven's already blown up an Imperial base!

829

需要制定一个对策\NA decision needed to be made.

830
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:53,200
如果这是你想要的战争 你将独自战斗!
If it's war you want, you'll fight alone!

831
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:55,670
如果那是大势所趋 为什么一直要有一个联盟?
If that's the way it's going, why have an Alliance at all?

832
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,790
如果她说的是真的 我们需要立即行动!
If she's telling the truth, we need to act now!

833
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,380
委员 有请!

834
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,510
很简单 帝国有大规模杀伤性手段反抗军没有
It is simple, the Empire has the means of mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.

835
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,310
死星 这是胡说
A Death Star, this is nonsense.

836
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:10,420
什么原因使我父亲非得说谎?这能带给他什么好处?
What reason would my father have to lie? What benefit would it bring him?

837
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:14,920
引诱我们的部队进入一场最终战役 一劳永逸摧毁我们\NTo lure our forces into a final battle. To destroy us once and for all.

838
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:18,970
要冒一切风险 基于什么? 一个罪犯的证词?

她父亲的临终遗言 一位帝国科学家?
The dying words of her father, an Imperial scientist?

别忘了帝国飞行员

我父亲献出了自己的生命 这样我们就有机会战胜这些
My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this.

842

那你告诉我们

843
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:32,520
如果帝国有这种力量 我们又有什么机会?
If the Empire has this kind of power, what chance do we have?

844
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:34,750
我们又有什么机会?
What chance do we have?

845
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:37,840
问题是"什么选择?"
The question is 'What choice?'

846
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:41,720
跑?隐藏?恳求宽恕?分散你们的部队?
Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces?

847
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,520
你让路给这个具有如此力量的邪恶的敌人
You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power

848
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:47,580
你再宣判银河系要永恒的屈服\Nand you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission.

849
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:49,500
战斗的时刻就是现在!是的
The time to fight is now!Yes.

850
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,550
每一刻你浪费的 不过是又一步距杰达的灰烬更近\NEvery moment you waste is another step closer to the ashes of Jedha.

851
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:57,160
她有什么建议?且让那女孩说说!

派出整个反抗军舰队如果你不得不\NSend the whole rebel fleet if you have to.

我们需要夺取死星蓝图只要有任何希望能摧毁它
We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it.

855
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:18,170
你在要求我们入侵一个帝国的基地 基于的却只有希望?
You're asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope?

856
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:21,980
反抗建立于希望\NRebellions are built on hope.

857
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:25,380
没希望了
There is no hope.

01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,380
我说我们得战斗\NI say we fight.

我很抱歉 琴\NI'm sorry, Jyn.

861
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:41,000
没有委员会的全力支持, 
Without the full support of the council,

862
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,330
赔率太大
the odds are too great.

863
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:09,130
将军本多拉 请向简报室报告

我告诉自己这是为了一个我相信的事业\NI told myself it was for a cause that I believed in.

883
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,790
一个值得的事业\NA cause that was worth it.

884
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,200
不这样想 我们就会迷失
Without that, we're lost.

885
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:29,680
我们所做的一切都将失去意义\NEverything we've done would have been for nothing.

886

我无法面对自己如果现在我放弃
