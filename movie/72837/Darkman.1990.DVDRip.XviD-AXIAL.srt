1
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,758
'Cause he's an asshole!
Tell him no.

2
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,274
Tell him no, too.

3
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,952
Him,
tell fuck you.

4
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,951
No, I'll be here
a minute.

5
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,359
Got some guy coming up

6
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,238
who thinks he'll muscle me
out of my property.

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,673
Another tough guy,
that's all.

8
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,113
They're driving up.

9
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,191
Get their pieces.

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,270
Hmm.

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,318
We got a surprise
for these gentlemen.

12
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,915
Robert Durant,

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,391
you and your girls are going
to stand for a search.

14
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,033
All right, move it.

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,997
There you go.

16
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,992
Oh, a bunch of cuties,
huh?

17
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,878
Just hold it
there, cueball.

18
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,159
Bum leg?

19
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,470
No leg.

20
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,358
I was engaged to a girl
with a wooden leg.

21
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,316
What happened?

22
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,913
Had to break it off.

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,951
All right, cut the crap.

24
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,838
I got three things
to say to you, Durant.

25
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,909
One,

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,877
I ain't selling
my property.

27
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,635
Two, nobody
muscles Eddie Black,

28
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,359
especially
a bunch of dinks.

29
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,715
And three, if y'alls
don't like that,

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,155
which I can already
see you don't,

31
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,993
we can cut
your balls off.

32
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,197
Maybe that would be
more satisfactory to you.

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,753
Ha ha ha ha!

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,114
Die!

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,397
Take them down!

36
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,798
Take him down!

37
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,871
Take that one
with the goddamn gun!

38
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,838
Now...

39
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,229
let's consider
my points...

40
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,709
one by one.

41
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,313
One.

42
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,549
I try not to let
my anger

43
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,039
get the better
of me.

44
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,838
Two.

45
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,070
I don't always
succeed.

46
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,349
Three.

47
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,516
I've got seven
more points.

48
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,829
System ready
to receive input.

49
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,355
Just hold together,
you little...

50
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,073
shit.

51
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,593
Fragmentation.
Time?

52
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,035
99 minutes...

53
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,872
again.

54
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,512
Why?

55
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,478
Why, why, why?

56
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,989
Synthetic skin
data analysis...

57
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,713
What is
destabilizing it?

58
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,553
Why won't the liquid
skin last?

59
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,869
The vivification process
was easy.

60
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,995
Tissue rejection?

61
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,238
We licked that.
I know we're close.

62
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,596
We're smart guys,
so what is it?

63
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,638
Why can't we make
these cells stable?

64
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,437
What now?

65
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,268
Now?

66
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,509
Well...

67
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,795
we think it out again.

68
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,995
Patiently.

69
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,479
Objectively.

70
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,358
I don't care how long
it takes, Yakitito,

71
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,273
I know it's out there
waiting for us.

72
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,237
Ah, I can feel it.

73
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,993
God, I can almost
taste it.

74
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,754
Here she is... the
girl of your dreams.

75
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,398
Oh! Oh, Peyton!

76
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,833
Ah, you were sweet.

77
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,672
How's the skin coming?

78
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,513
Still won't last
past 99.

79
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,593
It'll happen. It will
happen, you know.

80
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,869
Ha ha ha!
Look at you.

81
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,632
Rebel without a clue.

82
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,870
Those were the days.

83
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,359
Hey...

84
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,715
What?

85
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,153
Come here.

86
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,150
What?

87
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,070
Come here.

88
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,152
Oh, I know what's
on your mind.

89
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,559
God, you always wear

90
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,517
things that are
so difficult to...

91
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,430
Ta-da!

92
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,396
Oh, yeah!

93
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,712
Come on,
let's dance.

94
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,038
Herb Gorson, please.

95
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,393
Here you go, babe.

96
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,356
Peyton!

97
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,316
Oops. Sorry.

98
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,276
Yeah?

99
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,191
Herb, hi.
It's Julie Hastings.

100
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,555
Listen,
I found some memos

101
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,915
when I was researching
the Von Hoffenstein deal

102
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,798
that I don't think
I was supposed to find.

103
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,599
They're from Strack
to a guy named...

104
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,352
Claude Bellasarious.

105
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,793
They're records
of payments

106
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,189
to various people
on the Zoning Commission.

107
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,111
Well, I think
they're payoffs.

108
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,509
Yeah, well,
what I want to do

109
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,953
is talk
to Strack first,

110
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,873
give him the benefit
of the doubt.

111
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,154
Yeah, O.K.

112
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,073
All right, I'll talk
to you later, Herb.

113
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,036
Bye, Herb.

114
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,311
Oh, I don't want to go.

115
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,276
Don't go.

116
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,713
I have to go.

117
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,756
I have to go now!
I'm late.

118
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,670
Julie!

119
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,478
I'll call you
later.

120
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,630
Maybe.

121
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,990
Julie!
Julie, wait.

122
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,433
What is it?

123
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,635
I've been thinking.

124
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,630
Mm-hmm.

125
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,996
We should get married.

126
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,594
Marriage?

127
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,591
Uh-huh.

128
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,672
I've just started
getting things going at the firm,

129
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,069
and I really like
having my own place.

130
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,832
We're practically
living together now.

131
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,029
All marriage means

132
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,475
is you answer the phone
in the morning,

133
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,879
and if
it's my grandmother,

134
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,315
you don't pretend
it's the wrong number.

135
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,197
The woman thinks
she has Alzheimer's.

136
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,872
I can't talk
about it now.

137
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,394
Jules, I'm asking you
to marry me.

138
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,879
Peyton, I love you...

139
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,836
I realized...

140
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,150
but I got to
think it over, O.K.?

141
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,711
Mr. Strack, I've been

142
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,153
going over
some documents.

143
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,468
I've come across
something

144
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,675
that puzzles me.

145
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,069
It's a memo
from your office

146
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,469
to a Mr. Claude
Bellasarious.

147
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,438
It details certain
payments that...

148
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,158
Yes, I know the memo.

149
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,231
It seems like
the payments were...

150
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,880
were payoffs
to the Zoning Commission.

151
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,758
Bribes, to call
a spade a spade.

152
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,193
Does that shock you?

153
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,589
No. I guessed as much.

154
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,511
You weren't supposed
to know about it.

155
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,909
That file was not
supposed to circulate.

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,231
However, I am asking you
to understand.

157
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,078
Take a look
at that model, Julie.

158
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,479
That's the dream...

159
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,872
acres of riverfront
reclaimed from decay,

160
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,791
thousands of jobs
created.

161
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,713
A building block,
a very large building block

162
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,119
laid for the future.

163
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,591
Not such a bad dream,
as dreams go.

164
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,478
And if the price
of realizing that dream

165
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,869
is the occasional
distasteful chore,

166
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,918
well, I don't run away.

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,958
I say so be it.

168
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,634
So...

169
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,393
want to book me?

170
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,789
The fact remains
that I'm in possession

171
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,348
of evidence of the
commission of a crime.

172
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,793
Let me suggest this...

173
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,233
you excuse yourself
for few minutes,

174
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,630
go to the ladies room
leaving your briefcase here.

175
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,039
What happens
to that memorandum

176
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,951
while it's
in my custody

177
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,395
is my responsibility.

178
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,755
I wish it were
that simple,

179
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,832
but I don't have
the memo with me.

180
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,593
I'm trying to protect you.

181
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,233
Does the name
Robert Durant

182
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,912
mean anything to you?

183
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,753
Drugs, racketeering...

184
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,159
and real estate.

185
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,118
Robert Durant is a competitor
for the riverfront.

186
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,919
He's a very
dangerous man, Julie.

187
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,991
I fully believe
he'd do anything

188
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,878
to get his hands
on that document.

189
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,949
DNA content...
acceptable.

190
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,393
Glucose...
right on.

191
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,879
We've
even checked

192
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,279
the collagen
congeners.

193
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,236
They're fine.

194
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,719
This is
unbelievable.

195
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,835
Every day,

196
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,148
it's a different
combination.

197
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,753
Time, Yakitito.
Time.

198
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,070
98 minutes.

199
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,630
Oh...

200
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,551
the circuit again.
I'll fix it.

201
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,789
I knew we pulled

202
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,871
too much juice
on that line.

203
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,949
Yakitito, time.

204
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,870
Huh?

205
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,836
Time?

206
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,830
99.

207
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,598
100 minutes!

208
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,636
What? What?

209
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,312
The cells,
they're holding.

210
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,310
They're stable!

211
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,597
But, Dr. Westlake,
why now?

212
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,232
The dark.

213
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,470
Oh, of course.

214
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,675
The dark.

215
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,591
I think the
synthetic cells

216
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,033
are
photosensitive.

217
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,473
This is
unbelievable!

218
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,028
What is it
about the dark?

219
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,837
What secret
does it hold?

220
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,712
They're still
stable.

221
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,199
Time, Yakitito,
Time!

222
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,430
101 minutes.

223
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,714
Finally...

224
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,597
we can replace
damaged skin tissue!

225
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,830
No, Yakitito,
not quite, my friend.

226
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,195
We've just got
a piece of the puzzle.

227
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,633
There's still
the big question...

228
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,472
how to keep
the cells stable

229
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,118
past 99 minutes
in the light?

230
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,839
Now we know
it's all about light!

231
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,359
I'll get it.

232
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,428
No foolish heroics,
if you please.

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,831
We've come
only for documents.

234
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,273
Tell us where to find

235
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,759
the Bellasarious
memorandum,

236
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,114
and we shall disappear

237
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,033
like a nightmare
before the breaking day.

238
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,112
I don't know what
you're talking about.

239
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,553
Unfortunate.

240
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,517
What memorandum?

241
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,033
No, please.

242
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,155
We want
the memorandum.

243
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,038
Should your houseboy's
predicament

244
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,076
not jog your memory...

245
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,950
you may bid him
Godspeed.

246
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,439
He's a lab assistant.

247
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,034
For God's sakes,
let him breathe!

248
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,872
You heard the doctor.
Ventilate him.

249
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,836
No...

250
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,069
No!

251
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,191
Ooh! Ooh!

252
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,793
Bingo.

253
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,869
Goody!

254
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,831
Bring the Asian's fingers.

255
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,394
Gentlemen.

256
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,311
Rick, I'm proud of you.

257
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,710
Clean through the brain...
that's how I like it.

258
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,995
"Marry me?"

259
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,671
Didn't see you
doing much work.

260
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,432
That guy got
blown to pieces.

261
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,317
All they found
was an ear.

262
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,753
Tiny little
piece.

263
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,354
Didn't take long
to bury that.

264
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,193
You'll be all right.

265
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,872
You'll be all right.

266
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,359
We'll need
some sponges.

267
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,839
O.K., I got 'em.

268
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,354
Great.
We'll get ready.

269
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,351
Let's check
the eyes.

270
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,556
Get a gurney
in here.

271
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,119
Right there.

272
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,519
Straight in.

273
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,068
Next, we have
a 30, 35-year-old male,

274
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,832
no I.D.,
no medical history.

275
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,717
He was found
on the riverbank

276
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,199
just south of the city.

277
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,077
There are homeless
and indigents there.

278
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,993
We get three no-names
every week.

279
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,355
Nobody does anything until
they become train wrecks

280
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,839
like Mr. John Doe here.

281
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,275
He's got burns
covering 40% of his body.

282
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,920
The hands and face
are the most severe.

283
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,353
Ten years ago,

284
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,749
pain from the burns
would have been intolerable.

285
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,990
He would have spent
his life screaming.

286
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,152
Now we use
the Rangeveritz Technique.

287
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,355
Quite simply,

288
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,034
we sever the nerves within
the spino-thalamic tract,

289
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,429
there... which, as you know,
transmits neural impulses

290
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,830
of pain and vibratory sense
to the brain.

291
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,959
No longer receiving
impulses of pain,

292
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,793
you stick him
with a pin...

293
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,870
Ouch.

294
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,428
and he can't
even feel it.

295
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,957
As in many
radical procedures,

296
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,953
there are serious side
effects to this operation.

297
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,554
When the body
ceases to feel,

298
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,234
when so much
sensory input is lost,

299
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,390
the mind grows hungry.

300
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,233
Starved of
its regular diet of input,

301
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,551
it takes the only remaining
stimulation it has...

302
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,516
the emotions...

303
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,670
and amplifies them,

304
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,115
giving rise to alienation
and loneliness.

305
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,077
Uncontrolled rage
is not uncommon.

306
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,479
Now surges of adrenaline

307
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,869
flow unchecked
through the body and brain,

308
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,359
giving him
augmented strength.

309
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,749
Hence, the restraints.

310
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,638
Naturally, we give them
every chance of recovery.

311
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,596
Remain optimistic,

312
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,557
inspire confidence,

313
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,632
talk to him about
rehabilitation potential.

314
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,358
Personally, I give him a 9
on the buzzard scale.

315
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,319
Code blue, burn unit.

316
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,828
Doctor?

317
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,638
I'm in charge here.

318
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,233
Damn it,
let me through!

319
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,798
Ju... lie.

320
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,877
Julie!

321
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,393
It's...

322
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,869
me!

323
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,074
My lab.

324
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,718
All my work.

325
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,951
Oh, my God, no.

326
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,712
No! No!

327
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,950
No! No! No!

328
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,638
Hello, my friend.

329
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,435
Home.

330
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,110
Good. Good.

331
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,233
System re...

332
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,711
System... System ready
for digitization program.

333
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,313
Enter code.

334
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,029
O.K.

335
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,992
Digitalization
in progress.

336
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,116
In progress.

337
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,431
Insufficient data.

338
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,075
Oh, God.

339
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,433
Oh, no, please.

340
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,430
Please, no.

341
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,909
Quadrant A, Quadrant C

342
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,797
unrecognizable.

343
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,391
What am I doing
wrong?

344
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,879
What?

345
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,154
Yes.

346
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,116
Quadrants.
Quadrants.

347
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,553
Extrapolate.

348
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,629
Yes.

349
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,038
Quadrant recognition
active.

350
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,193
Digitization
in progress.

351
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,553
Yes, that's it.

352
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,675
Clever, clever.

353
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,636
I must perfect the skin.

354
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,476
Wrong!

355
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,390
Wrong!

356
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,435
My hands.

357
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,668
They took...
They took my hands.

358
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,751
They... They took...

359
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,354
They took my hands!

360
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,709
Thank you for coming.

361
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,997
Julie... with what you've
been going through lately,

362
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,910
I, uh...

363
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,275
I haven't wanted
to bother you.

364
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,759
But I have to know

365
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,398
whether you've come
to a decision

366
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,833
regarding the Bellasarious
memorandum.

367
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,639
The decision's been
made for both of us.

368
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,678
The papers were
destroyed in the fire.

369
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,229
And I'd rather not
talk about it,

370
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,719
if you don't mind.

371
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,709
Julie, I'm sorry
I mentioned that.

372
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,676
Believe me,

373
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,637
I understand
how you feel.

374
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,073
I really do.

375
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,990
Unfortunately,

376
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,230
there's no cure
for grief.

377
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,673
But there is
something

378
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,159
that eases
the symptoms.

379
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,878
It's called dancing.

380
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,798
Would you, uh,
like a martini?

381
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,110
Yes.
I would love one.

382
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,708
Ventilate him.

383
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,078
His name's
Robert G. Durant!

384
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,799
I told you where
they make the pickup!

385
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,149
Oh, God! Don't!

386
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,470
I've told you
everything!

387
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,232
I know, Rick.

388
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,992
I know you did.

389
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,070
But let's pretend
you didn't!

390
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,273
Here you are, doll.

391
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,554
Here's your favorite.

392
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,039
How you doing, honey?

393
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,633
I'm pretty good today.

394
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,713
It wasn't that bad.

395
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,676
Hey, Pauly.

396
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,636
Hey, Pauly.

397
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,596
¿Que pasa?

398
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,556
¿Que pasa?

399
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,993
How are you, man?

400
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,433
Where's Rick?

401
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,078
Here's the cash, man.

402
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,277
Got you a gift,
huh?

403
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,554
You be good.

404
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,914
I'll see ya.

405
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,638
See you later, pal.

406
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,639
System ready for
digitization program.

407
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,238
Enter code.

408
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,748
Code... Code recognized.

409
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,395
Data entry required.

410
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,315
System standing by.

411
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,313
It's time.

412
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,915
Yeah.

413
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,515
Yo, Pauly.

414
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,718
Hey, Durant wants to know
where Rick is,

415
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,519
and he is hot.
I mean really hot.

416
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,953
Don't ask me why.

417
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,871
I know
he likes Ricky.

418
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,396
Pauly, do you know
where the hell Rick is?

419
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,073
Mmm-mmm.

420
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,477
You O.K., Pauly?

421
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,595
Yeah.

422
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,318
Here's the cash.

423
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,997
Pauly, we've been very
concerned about you.

424
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,433
Hey, Mr. Durant.

425
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,839
I must've overslept.

426
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,708
I'm sorry. I guess
I missed the pickup, huh?

427
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,119
Where's the money,
Pauly?

428
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,158
What money? I... I didn't
make the pickup.

429
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,239
Rio.

430
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,550
And first class.
How delightful.

431
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,876
And another one
for Rick.

432
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,029
Well. That explains
his disappearance.

433
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,475
Hey, I don't know
nothing about that.

434
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,198
Where is the money, Pauly?

435
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,271
What money?
I swear, Mr. Durant,

436
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,078
I didn't make
the pickup.

437
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,309
I've been here sleeping.

438
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,118
Jesus,
I swear to God.

439
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,158
Why... I don't even know
how I got dressed!

440
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,113
Well, Pauly...

441
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,832
have a nice flight.

442
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,631
Oh, God. What have I become?

443
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,233
What have I become?

444
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,995
Please.

445
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,475
Hold. Please hold.

446
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,835
Oh, just this once.

447
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,636
Oh, what?

448
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,633
What am I?

449
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,753
What am I, hmm?

450
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,230
Some kind of a circus freak?
Is that it?

451
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,949
Is that it? Huh?
Some kind of a freak?

452
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,349
Maybe I should wear
a funny little hat.

453
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,793
Do you like it?

454
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,915
Yeah? Yeah?

455
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,036
See the dancing freak

456
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,838
Pay five bucks

457
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,399
To see the dancing freak

458
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,471
Only five bucks

459
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,996
To see the dancing freak

460
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,310
Just five bucks

461
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,395
I'll give you a show!

462
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,278
I'll give you
a goddamned show!

463
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,873
Yeah!

464
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,918
I'll show you
I'm not a freak!

465
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,035
Yeah!

466
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,433
Oh, God.

467
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,511
Oh, Jesus, God.

468
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,476
Oh, keep a lid on it!

469
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,233
I'm a scientist.

470
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,151
Uh-huh. That's it.

471
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,673
Think objectively.

472
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,956
Analyze. Analyze.

473
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,634
Wait. Wait. That's it.

474
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,073
Control the rage.

475
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,513
Just...

476
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,953
take it easy, Peyton.

477
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,950
Just...

478
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,678
take it easy, boy.

479
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,079
I'm a scientist.

480
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,399
I'm a scientist.

481
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,914
Reconstruction program...

482
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,036
Reconstruction program complete.

483
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,908
Julie.

484
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,468
No.

485
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,033
It's all right, Julie.

486
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,439
It's me, sweetheart.

487
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,033
No.

488
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,439
Please, Julie, please.

489
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,512
Don't be afraid.
Listen to me.

490
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,953
Who are you?

491
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,553
It's me.

492
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,709
Peyton.

493
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,353
You... are dead.

494
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,876
No, no, Jules. No.

495
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,757
I was in the hospital.

496
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,991
A coma.
Dead to the world.

497
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,036
Jules... please.

498
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,476
Please.
Please hold me.

499
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,272
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

500
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,399
I'm sorry. I didn't know
how to tell you.

501
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,833
I needed to see you.

502
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,878
I needed to know if things
could be the same.

503
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,269
Yes. But, Peyton,
I don't understand.

504
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,590
Shh.
I know it's a shock.

505
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,477
There's so much to it.

506
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,312
And I'll tell you
everything.

507
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,709
I just need
a little time.

508
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,633
Then just hold me,
Peyton, and don't let go.

509
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,712
I just... I just need
a little time.

510
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,716
I understand why
the doctors said

511
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,189
you shouldn't see me
after the coma.

512
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,838
That's their opinion.

513
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,113
What's yours?

514
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,872
I've got to have time

515
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,359
to work this out,
Julie...

516
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,839
on my own.

517
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,832
But where does that
leave us, Peyton?

518
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,958
I don't want to be
without you again.

519
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
I need you, too, Jules.

520
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,558
That's why I'm here.

521
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,159
It's just that I've...

522
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,038
I feel like a rag doll
all pieced together.

523
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,076
My insides
are on my outside.

524
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,993
If you could only see
how I feel inside.

525
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,355
I was ashamed. Afraid.
I was afraid

526
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,271
that you wouldn't
want me anymore.

527
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,874
Of course
I still want you.

528
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,516
Julie...

529
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,909
Julie,
what if I was hurt?

530
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,353
Like...
Like horribly scarred,

531
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,749
that you couldn't bear
to look at me

532
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,355
or have me touch you.
What then, huh?

533
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,475
Huh?

534
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,436
I don't know.

535
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,556
Honestly,
I don't know, Peyt.

536
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,075
But why do you
ask me that?

537
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,277
Look at you. You're fine.
And you're back.

538
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,909
Yes. I am back,
aren't I?

539
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,070
Just like always.

540
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,549
Yeah, what do you
want, buddy?

541
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,993
The name isn't Buddy.

542
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,479
It's Durant,
Robert G. Durant,

543
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,915
and I wish to speak
to Mr. Guzman.

544
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,876
O.K.

545
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,870
Thank you.

546
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,713
Rudy, some asshole's
on the phone for you.

547
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,119
Hey, Mr. Durant.

548
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,110
Ah, Rudy.

549
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,553
Pay attention.

550
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,959
Don't speak. Listen.

551
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,393
The funds Pauly
misappropriated

552
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,311
are beginning
to nettle me.

553
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,198
He's caused a serious
cash flow problem.

554
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,633
Did you receive

555
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,119
certain monies
from Chinatown today?

556
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,553
No, not today.

557
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,675
Unfortunate.

558
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,910
Then we shall have
to call upon Hung Fat.

559
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,753
Either he provides
the revenues owed to us,

560
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,638
or he becomes
part of my collection.

561
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,995
It would make
a nice addition.

562
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,354
Ha ha.
That's right.

563
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,749
You want me
to pick you up

564
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,068
at your place

565
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,354
tomorrow morning
around 8:30?

566
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,793
That would be...

567
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,029
just fine.

568
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,599
That would be...

569
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,151
just fine.

570
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,351
That would be...

571
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,555
just fine.

572
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,789
That would be...

573
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,074
just fine.

574
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,071
That would be...

575
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,354
just fine.

576
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,839
That would be...

577
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,073
Just fine.

578
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,598
Would you like a bag
for this, buddy?

579
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,033
That would be...

580
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,950
just fine.

581
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,395
Hey, hey,
take it easy, buddy.

582
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,789
My name isn't Buddy.

583
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,677
It's Durant.

584
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,639
Robert G. Durant.

585
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,550
Yes.

586
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,596
I'm Robert G. Durant.

587
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,875
Just fine.

588
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,078
Robert.

589
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,072
It's so good of you
to favor me

590
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,957
with your
venerated presence.

591
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,950
The money.

592
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,600
The money? Yes, Robert.

593
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,911
How I tremble
with shame.

594
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,833
I have no money.

595
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,718
How many times
do I have to tell you?

596
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,075
I was nowhere near
any convenience store!

597
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,958
They had the whole thing
on video.

598
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,349
Keep them
out of my hair!

599
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,590
You have to sign
those papers.

600
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,033
Where are you going?

601
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,236
Hong Kong Restaurant,
and fast!

602
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,828
White powder no longer flows
in its former volume.

603
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,718
All the members of Tong
languish in poverty.

604
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,598
Of all your
unworthy servants,

605
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,989
Hung Fat is
the most destitute.

606
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,389
Even my own
miserable slaves

607
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,948
sometimes ignore
my wishes

608
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,032
and upset those whom
I cherish most deeply.

609
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,554
So, until
that shining day...

610
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,790
may it soon come...

611
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,078
when I shall once again
honor you with offerings...

612
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,991
goodbye, Robert.

613
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,519
Robert, goodbye.

614
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,559
You will provide
the revenues owed to us

615
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,677
by the time
I finish this cigar.

616
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,990
But, Robert...

617
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,598
O.K., Bob, you win.

618
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,516
Damn! Drive!

619
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,431
Can't go no further.
Sorry.

620
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,873
It's a parade.

621
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,279
I'll get there myself.

622
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,236
What about
the fare?

623
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,309
Eat it!

624
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,349
Move!

625
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,475
Move it!

626
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,673
Where is he?

627
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,875
Where's who?

628
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,915
Guzman!

629
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,877
I thought
he was with you.

630
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,279
Shit!

631
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,309
Dios mio! ¿Que pasa?

632
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,789
There's two of those
son of a bitches!

633
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,715
Shoot him!

634
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,589
Shoot him!

635
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,908
Which one is Durant?

636
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,035
Not me, him!

637
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,951
Shoot him!

638
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,075
Shoot him!

639
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,116
Goddamn it!

640
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,998
Whose little boy are you?

641
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,071
It doesn't matter.

642
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,515
You're dead!

643
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,715
No, no. This one.

644
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,950
Don't just stand there.

645
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,074
Do something!

646
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,358
Son of a bitch sets
me up with the cops,

647
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,398
and you practically
hand him the cash.

648
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,589
Madre mia!

649
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,759
Mr. Durant, I'm sorry.

650
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,752
Step right up and take
a spin on the amazing...

651
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,750
Come on!

652
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,273
One more!

653
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,279
Would you stop looking
at that watch?

654
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,509
To hell with time!

655
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,750
Forget about going
back to the hospital.

656
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,195
We're going to spend
the whole day together.

657
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,872
And the whole night.

658
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,110
I can't. I've got
my therapy group.

659
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,509
Peyton, we need
more time together.

660
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,558
Why are you so
uncomfortable with me?

661
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,633
All right, Jules.

662
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,278
Listen to me.

663
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,233
I got to tell you
something about me,

664
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,514
how I've...

665
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,192
changed.

666
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,669
When I was
in the hospital, I...

667
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,150
See the mutant man!
Half man, half beast!

668
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,913
Witness this cruel
accident of science

669
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,309
with your own eyes.

670
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,390
Everybody gather 'round
and look closely.

671
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,833
As you can see...

672
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,956
Peyt, what?

673
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,837
Peyton, what is it?

674
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,034
When I was
in the hospital...

675
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,473
was there
someone else?

676
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,788
No.

677
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,678
Yes. There was a man
who comforted me,

678
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,558
and I respected him
for his kindness,

679
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,949
but he means
nothing to me.

680
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,871
Is that what it was?

681
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,313
Was that it, Peyt?

682
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,198
God, I love you,
darling!

683
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,589
Oh, it's good
to be back.

684
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,033
Come on,
Julie Hastings,

685
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,918
I'm going to win
for you the biggest,

686
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,275
fuzziest, pinkest
doll on that rack.

687
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,190
Yes.

688
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,157
Then I
got to run.

689
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,593
You always
have to run.

690
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,352
Why is it always
so dramatic?

691
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,271
I have my hospital
sessions.

692
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,191
I'm not 100% cured yet,

693
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,793
but I soon will be.

694
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,036
Where is
this place exactly?

695
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,031
I want to be
involved somehow.

696
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,792
Can I take you there?

697
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,711
No. Please, Julie,

698
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,268
I don't want you
to see me there.

699
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,148
I don't want you to think
of me as an invalid

700
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,151
or some kind of a freak.

701
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,914
Uh, the pink
elephant, please.

702
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,037
It don't count unless
you're behind the line.

703
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,588
I was
behind the line.

704
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,318
Not hardly.

705
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,153
I was standing right
here with my girlfriend.

706
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,800
Now, the pink elephant,
if you please.

707
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,189
No way.

708
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,719
It doesn't matter,
Peyton.

709
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,949
It matters.

710
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,789
I won a pink elephant
for my girlfriend.

711
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,156
Why don't you
just, uh...

712
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,798
get lost, pal?

713
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,914
The elephant.

714
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,514
Quickly.

715
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,678
Didn't you hear me...

716
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,389
weirdo?

717
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,153
Scram.

718
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,591
Take it! Take it!

719
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,194
Take the fucking elephant!

720
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,834
Please, no!

721
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,319
Forgive me.

722
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,756
Peyton, wait!

723
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,194
Half man and a freak.

724
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,589
He's a freak,
ladies and gentlemen,

725
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,716
he's a freak.

726
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,279
A freak.

727
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,479
Peyton.

728
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,959
Peyton?

729
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,552
Synthetic skin
data analysis.

730
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:25,556
Amino acid content
equals 64%.

731
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,118
Membrane potential equals
122 megavolts.

732
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:41,391
Destabilization
registering at 99.008.

733
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,915
Why didn't you
tell me, Peyton?

734
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,831
You should have
told me.

735
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,354
You should have
come to me, Peyt.

736
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,556
You didn't
have to lie.

737
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,875
Peyton.

738
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,872
I would have tried
to help you.

739
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,676
I can help you now.

740
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,916
You don't have to hide
from me anymore, Peyt.

741
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,835
Julie.

742
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,717
Louis,
we have to talk.

743
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,268
Excellent.
I love to talk.

744
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,713
Brandy?

745
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,199
No.

746
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,633
I'll have one.

747
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,709
It's Napoleon,

748
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,518
and it's
quite good.

749
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,989
I can't see you anymore.

750
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,913
Honey, take it easy.

751
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,549
As you say,
let's... let's talk.

752
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,437
You know about Peyton,

753
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,829
the man I was
involved with?

754
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,750
Of course.

755
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,795
He's alive.

756
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,029
He's back.

757
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,711
I won't be a moment.

758
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,909
Yes?

759
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,314
Franz,
this is a bad time.

760
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,238
The closing price?

761
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,111
I think it's
sufficiently diversified.

762
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,988
It's immaterial to me
what the market's doing.

763
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,877
I want you to buy.

764
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,269
10,000 krugerrands.

765
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,713
Fresh ones.

766
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,756
Yes. The Bellasarious
memorandum.

767
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,638
I'm sorry you had
to find that, Julie.

768
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,599
Our relationship didn't
need this further strain.

769
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,913
You burned
Peyton's lab.

770
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,672
Not me personally.

771
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,514
I have an employee who does
certain things for me,

772
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,636
unofficially,
off the books.

773
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,468
Robert doesn't
like to pay taxes.

774
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,155
And now you'll kill me.

775
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,788
Hardly.

776
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,471
You have nothing on me.

777
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,393
You'd find the extremely
expensive police department

778
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,311
quite unsympathetic.

779
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,079
Julie, consider
the big picture.

780
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,475
Consider what
we're building here.

781
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,358
You and I,
we're building a city.

782
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,353
We can't let anything
get in the way of that.

783
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,958
Despite the way
things might appear,

784
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,393
you can't pretend

785
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,789
certain moments haven't
passed between us.

786
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,552
We still have that.

787
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,912
If you're not
going to kill me...

788
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,991
I have things to do.

789
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,468
I suppose this is
goodbye then.

790
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,469
Send Robert in.

791
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,879
Yes, Mr. Strack.

792
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,948
Robert, I have
good news and bad.

793
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,669
Custom dictates that you
render the bad news first.

794
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,514
We have a little problem
with Miss Hastings.

795
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,353
It appears she has
uncovered our alliance.

796
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,873
No problem at all.

797
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,076
And the good news?

798
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,673
Your wife died.

799
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,319
I'm joking, of course.

800
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,198
No. The good news
is that I know

801
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,953
who's behind our little
troubles of late.

802
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,712
When you retrieved
my memorandum,

803
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,553
you failed to excise
the good doctor.

804
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,675
Westlake?

805
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,593
He's extinct.
I saw to it myself.

806
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,273
He's alive.

807
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,591
I don't like
loose ends, Robert.

808
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,033
Finish it.

809
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,473
Where is he?

810
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,711
I believe we have a guide.

811
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,314
Julie!

812
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,594
Look out!

813
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,871
I think he's out here!

814
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,075
He just went
on the roof!

815
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,357
Julie!

816
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,680
Oh, you've got to be
shitting me.

817
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,589
Hey, Smiley, he went
into the warehouse.

818
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,079
He's in here.

819
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,354
This door!

820
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:21,990
System ready
for digitization program.

821
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,231
Data entry required.

822
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,717
Smiley, is that you?

823
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,273
Smiley.

824
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,831
Where the hell are you?

825
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,313
Close.

826
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,109
Chinga tu madre!
Smiley, is that you?

827
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,113
Don't shoot, Smiley!

828
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,156
It's Guzman!

829
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,118
Holy shit.

830
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,873
Good shooting.

831
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,954
Come here.

832
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,871
You... have...

833
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,915
been... a...

834
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,036
bad... boy.

835
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,712
Set it down.

836
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,119
Set it down!

837
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,553
I want anything done,

838
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,279
I guess
I'll have to do it myself.

839
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,473
O.K., Durant.

840
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,835
I'll take care of that...

841
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,639
Take it up!
Take it up!

842
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,719
Take it up!

843
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,153
Knock him off!

844
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,117
Get him off!

845
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,553
Oh, shit!

846
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,270
You're dead!
You're dead!

847
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,839
You're dead!

848
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,469
Holograph
recognition active.

849
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,358
Holographic imaging
complete.

850
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,239
You're next, Durant!

851
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,629
I'm coming for you!

852
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,472
Shake him.

853
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,872
What the hell was that?

854
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,518
Go after him!

855
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,118
I got him!

856
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,790
Get away!

857
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,474
Get back!

858
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,629
Get back!

859
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,392
He's mine!

860
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,039
Oh, shit!

861
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,634
Excuse me.

862
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,839
This is Police Air-12.

863
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,753
Set down the man gently
and land your craft.

864
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,751
Put down your craft!

865
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,599
Dip him.

866
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,719
Look out!

867
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,070
Watch it!

868
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,190
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

869
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,513
Damn!

870
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,472
Hold it steady.

871
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,391
What the hell's he up to?

872
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,071
Kiss your ass goodbye!

873
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,232
No! No!

874
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,790
Burn in hell!

875
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,311
You look like hell,
Robert.

876
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,311
That son of a bitch
Westlake

877
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,469
malfunctioned
my helicopter.

878
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,516
How terrible for you.

879
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,953
He's a cockroach.

880
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,598
You think
you kill him,

881
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,989
and he pops up
someplace else.

882
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:52,356
I expect
he'll pop up here soon.

883
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,073
See, I know
how he thinks.

884
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,200
I don't think
the world will grieve

885
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,952
over one less attorney.

886
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,795
It's the tragedy
of my life

887
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,678
that I have to kill
the ones I love.

888
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,954
My wife...

889
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,519
late wife...

890
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,431
held certain deeds.

891
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,637
I sent her on a plane
over the Smokies.

892
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,711
Let's just say

893
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,678
I landed on my feet.

894
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,677
I'm glad
you survived, Robert.

895
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,069
I'd hate to see your kids

896
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,151
deprived of a role model.

897
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,634
They do look up to me.

898
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,438
When I was young,

899
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,637
my father made me work
high steel.

900
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,551
Just me and the Indians.

901
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,959
No one else crazy enough

902
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,430
to run around up here
against the wind

903
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,317
at $4.50 an hour.

904
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,356
Call me crazy.

905
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,112
Sometimes I miss it.

906
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,839
Life on the edge.

907
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,558
Five inches wide,

908
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,076
650 feet down.

909
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,037
High steel!

910
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,838
Oh, by the way,

911
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,388
you don't have
any kids, Robert.

912
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,550
You truly are one
ugly son of a bitch.

913
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,471
What do you think,
Julie?

914
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,630
Who's the real
monster here?

915
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,917
I destroy to build
something better.

916
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,149
Whereas you,

917
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:50,119
you're a man
who destroys for revenge.

918
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,952
Look.

919
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,429
Look about you.

920
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,795
It's all mine.

921
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,232
Because I built it.

922
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,517
I built it all!

923
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,639
What have you got,

924
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,871
besides a little trouble
with your complexion?

925
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,951
I'm joking, of course.

926
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,712
A troubled conscience?

927
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,191
A little blood
on your hands

928
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,077
from what you
consider justice?

929
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,195
Justice.

930
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,633
You and I know

931
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,518
it's just another
word for what I do.

932
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,431
We should be
working together.

933
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,750
I could use
a man like you.

934
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,910
That's why
I brought you here.

935
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,709
You'll make lots of money
working for me.

936
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,031
If you still want her,
I'll throw in Julie.

937
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,838
Sound good?

938
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,319
Oops.

939
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,394
Pey...

940
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,434
Bitch!

941
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,397
Peyton!

942
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,398
Here you go!

943
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:32,949
Julie.

944
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,429
Peyton?

945
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,392
Come on.

946
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,992
You're going down,
Burn Head!

947
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,638
Oh, no!

948
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,188
Help me!

949
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,039
In your absence,

950
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,510
I've gotten to know Julie
quite intimately.

951
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,319
Her tastes are varied,

952
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,789
but I can tell you this...

953
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,871
she doesn't date freaks.

954
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,876
Peyton!

955
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,399
Julie!

956
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,754
Go ahead.

957
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,670
Do it.

958
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,954
Do it,
Westlake.

959
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,678
But think of this...

960
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,876
you let me die,

961
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,918
and you become
as bad as me. Worse.

962
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,798
You can't.

963
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,792
I know you too well.

964
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,677
Dropping me

965
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,673
is not really
an option for you.

966
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,718
It's not something
you could live with.

967
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:28,232
I'm learning to live
with a lot of things.

968
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,513
Don't look at me.

969
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,113
I want to look.

970
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,193
You'll perfect the skin.

971
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,633
You'll make it work.

972
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,039
It doesn't matter.

973
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,758
Julie...

974
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,309
don't you think
I told myself that,

975
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,753
night after
sleepless night?

976
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,195
It's just a burn.
Skin-deep.

977
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,714
It doesn't matter.

978
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,677
And if I covered it,

979
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,079
hid behind a mask,

980
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:18,277
you could love me
for who I was inside.

981
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,157
Without pity.

982
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,828
But a funny thing
happened.

983
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,195
As I worked on the mask,

984
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,113
I found the man inside
was changing.

985
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,270
He became wrong...

986
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,795
a monster.

987
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,235
I can live with it now,

988
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,912
but nobody else can.

989
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,675
I want our life back.

990
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,993
Peyton!

991
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,273
Peyton!

992
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,793
Peyton is gone.

993
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,188
Peyt?

994
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,995
Hey!

995
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,956
I'm everyone...

996
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,598
and no one...

997
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,230
everywhere...

998
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,117
nowhere.

999
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,839
Call me...

1000
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,717
Darkman.
