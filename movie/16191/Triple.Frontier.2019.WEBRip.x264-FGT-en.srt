-I don't know.

182
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,206
They took my brother,
and you have to get him out.

183
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,090
-Get him out?
-Yes.

184
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,961
You're lucky he's still alive.

185
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:41,955
But he won't be alive for very long.

186
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,666
[Santiago] You never should've let
your idiot brother get involved

187
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:45,585
with this shit.

188
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:47,206
[sighs]

189
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,303
[in English] What if I told you I know?

190
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,091
I know where Lorea is.

191
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,666
I know where the money is.
How long have you known?

192
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,336
Three months.

193
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:12,961
And why wouldn't you tell me that?

194
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,626
Because I'm just your informant, right?

195
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,550
That's all I am?

196
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,760
If you've got something to tell me,
right now is the time to do it.

197
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:25,918
[informant] I...

198
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:29,255
was given a promotion.

199
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,796
I deliver vans full of money...

200
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:34,918
to Lorea's house in the jungle.

201
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:36,875
That's where he keeps the money.

202
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,843
[in Spanish] His house is a safe.

203
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:41,668
[in English] And just so you know,

204
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:46,045
Lorea pays Diego and all of those men
that hired you way too much money.

205
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,050
They've just been watching you
chase your tail.

206
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,170
But now, maybe,
you can actually do something.

207
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,296
[somber march playing]

208
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,380
Your government has put a lot of time,
money, and training into all of you,

209
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:23,916
and it does not want to lose
that investment.

210
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:26,375
Over the next few weeks,

211
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:30,843
you will be bombarded with offers
to take your skill set and use them

212
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,551
in the private sector.

213
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,513
I was suckered into the same thing.

214
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:39,263
That's what I'm here to say,

215
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,261
that I have never had a feeling
as pure or proud

216
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:48,173
as completing a mission
with our flag on my shoulder.

217
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,170
Stay where you belong.

218
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:53,011
Thank you.

219
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,421
[man speaks indistinctly]

220
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:01,706
-[door opens]
-[William] Good luck.

221
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:06,211
-[both chuckle]
-[William grunts]

222
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,006
How many times have you given that speech?

223
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,711
It'll be 173.

224
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,296
[Santiago laughs] Still keeping count
of everything in your life?

225
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,210
Of course.

226
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,046
-[Santiago] It's still a good speech.
-Thank you.

227
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:17,585
How you been?

228
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,711
I'm okay. You?

229
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,261
Did you get my text?

230
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:24,418
Yeah.

231
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:29,756
[Santiago] So? What's your take?

232
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:32,298
Who else do you have?

233
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:33,586
I came to you first.

234
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,341
If you can get Redfly,

235
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,960
I'll do it.

236
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:45,883
Really?

237
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:48,303
Yeah.

238
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:50,801
[Santiago]
Do you think he's up for it?

239
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:55,301
I just feel like we owe him.
Besides...

240
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:58,673
it's always a little harder
than you think it's gonna be, right?

241
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,755
Get the captain, I'm in.

242
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:10,841
So... this is three bedroom...
and one and a half baths.

243
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,420
Nice view out the back window here.

244
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:21,955
Gets good light.

245
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,211
Kitchen's right this way.

246
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:27,838
They're asking $120,000.

247
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:32,088
-I think there's some flexibility there.
-Yeah.

248
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:35,086
I don't think this is the one for us.
Thank you, though.

249
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,296
All right, thank you.

250
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,171
[door opens]

251
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,841
[door closes]

252
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:56,208
[man sighs]

253
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,665
[Santiago] Hey, I'm lookin' for a condo.

254
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,835
I hear you're the guy to talk to.

255
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,666
-Sorry to track you down like this.
-Hey, man.

256
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:07,795
I called your office.

257
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,170
-[Redfly] It's good to see you.
-[Santiago] Good to see you.

258
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:11,755
-You look great.
-Ah, yeah, right.

259
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,798
-No, you do.
-It's been a while, huh?

260
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Well, we didn't hear from you
for a couple of years.

261
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:18,053
We thought you might have gone full native
in the jungle.

262
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,460
[Santiago] Yeah, I know.

263
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:20,918
Sorry.

264
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:24,093
-So, how are you?
-[Redfly sighs]

265
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,760
Uh... I'm okay.

266
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,755
[Santiago] Yeah,
I heard about you and Molly.

267
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:31,338
Yeah. It happens.

268
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:34,508
So, I got a job for you.

269
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,956
Guaranteed 17 grand
for a week of consulting.

270
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:42,046
No action unless you want it.
It's just a recce.

271
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,960
I'm retired.

272
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,133
I know. [chuckles]

273
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:46,511
What is it?

274
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,045
We're gonna get Gabriel Martin Lorea.

275
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,880
[Redfly] Haven't you been trying
to do that for years?

276
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:53,763
Yes.
I could never find him, and I finally did.

277
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:55,835
I can't do it, man.

278
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,801
There's more of this shit
around now than ever.

279
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
Anthony was down here trying
to get me to go to Africa for a month,

280
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,255
-but I-- I can't-- I can't do it.
-[Santiago] I need you on this one.

281
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,796
-It's less than a week of work.
-I would love to.

282
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,840
God knows I could use the money,

283
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:09,051
but I'm supporting
two households right now.

284
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,005
There's potential
for significant upside on this.

285
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,208
Will you just take a look
at my work on it?

286
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:15,843
[sighs, clicks tongue]

287
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,090
-Are you going to Benny's fight?
-[Santiago] Yeah.

288
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,463
I gotta pick up Tess. I'm late.
Molly's gonna kill me.

289
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,376
-Just ride with me, okay?
-[Santiago] All right.

290
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:29,875
[Santiago] Molly's still letting you
over here, even after the split?

291
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,341
Only in the garage.

292
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,380
[Santiago] I'm sorry.

293
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:38,048
[sighs] Tess!

294
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,671
-Still drink?
-[Santiago] Oh, yeah.

295
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,585
Want a beer?

296
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:48,798
[Tom] Ah, shit.

297
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,955
[sighs] You sleeping with this woman?

298
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,760
The accountant, the bean counter
who gave you all the information.

299
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:11,758
I'm guessing she's hot.

300
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,418
-[can opens]
-What's that supposed to mean?

301
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:15,125
Oh, well, I just noticed, over the years,

302
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,463
your informants tend to be
very attractive women.

303
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:19,086
[Tom chuckles]

304
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:21,261
No, I'm not.

305
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:24,171
[clicks tongue, sighs] Why not?

306
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,708
[Santiago] It's a fucked-up enough
situation as it is.

307
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,800
[Tom] Hey, babe.

308
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,208
[Santiago] Hey, Tess!

309
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,008
[sighs] Santiago.

310
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,128
Wow, so grown up, man.

311
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,463
-[Tom] Oh, I don't know about that.
-[Santiago chuckles]

312
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:45,963
I made 17 grand my first year
in the service, man.

313
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:49,206
If you told me then I'd be passing that up
for a week's work...

314
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:54,296
Don't worry about her, she's 15.
She's not listening to a word we say.

315
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:57,213
[Santiago]
Seventeen grand is just for the recce.

316
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:01,301
But if we decide to move forward,
this could be a whole lot more than that.

317
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,671
I've cut a deal
with the agency down there.

318
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,755
We keep 25% of anything we seize.

319
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,458
I've got estimates he's got
over $75 million in cash with him.

320
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,841
-[Tom] Holy shit.
-Yeah.

321
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,673
Let's say the money is there.
How do we get paid?

322
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:20,258
'Cause this shit is serious,
and it takes real planning.

323
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:21,378
And you know that.

324
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:22,883
[Santiago] I've got a lawyer in St. John's

325
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:25,881
who set up
an offshore shell security operation

326
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:29,303
that's ready to pay out a salary
and bonuses for the rest of our lives.

327
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,130
It'll just come in
like any other paycheck.

328
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:33,343
Will you take a look at my work on it?
No, I don't want to see that
because then I can't unsee it.

329
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,710
This operation is... illegal, right?

330
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:41,666
This is not illegal.

331
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:45,085
My company's under contract
to an agency of a foreign government.

332
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:48,801
And besides, even if it was illegal,
most of the live fire you've done's been

333
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,710
against the Geneva Convention,
technically, so...

334
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,876
[Tom] Come on,
you're a better salesman than that.

335
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:55,553
This is a very different thing.

336
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,455
I'll be right back.

337
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:03,591
[door chimes jingle]

338
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,591
[Tess] So you're trying to get him
to go back to work?

339
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:08,918
[door chimes jingle]

340
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:12,013
Maybe. Why?

341
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:15,761
No reason.

342
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:19,505
You think your mom would still let him go?

343
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:22,166
[Tess] My mom? [chuckles] Of course.

344
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:26,005
<i>-She's </i>not the problem. [sighs]
-[door chimes jingle]

345
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,548
[Tess] He hasn't worked
since they forced him to retire.
[Fleetwood Mac's "The Chain" playing]

346
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:32,341
Your dad's a good man.

347
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,458
You shouldn't be too hard on him.

348
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,710
[door opens]

349

517
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,760
[Santiago] <i>Worried</i>
<i>about someone taking his kids.</i>

518
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:55,918
<i>And he never leaves his money.</i>

519
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,710
Also, I don't think he believes
anyone actually has the balls

520
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:00,086
to come out here and rob him.

521
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:02,593
It's probably 'cause it's a stupid idea.

522
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:08,588
[Benny] <i>Pope,</i>
<i>I got your girlfriend coming up right now.</i>

523
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:11,045
Holy shit.

524
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,760
She is beautiful, man.

525
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,170
I fucking knew it.

526
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,760
Fuck off.

527
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:28,711
[William whispers] God damn.

528
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:36,053
I got an execution
about to go down over here.

529
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,586
Are you at the tennis courts?

530
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:38,511
[William] <i>Yeah.</i>

531
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:39,798
Yeah, that's his spot.

532
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:42,755
[Lorea] <i>Perdóname, padre.</i>

533
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:43,838
[flies buzzing]

534
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,011
[gun fires]

535
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:49,171
-[gun continues firing]
-[sighs]

536
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:53,258
[gun cocks]

537
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,125
[Frankie] <i>Why is she doing this?</i>

538
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:01,711
[Santiago] <i>She hopes I can get</i>
<i>her little brother out of jail.</i>

539
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,205
[Benny] <i>Did you put him in jail?</i>

540
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:06,956
-[Santiago] <i>Not really.</i>
-<i>Buenas.</i>

541
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:10,378
[Tom]<i> I'm guessing that's putting her</i>
<i>at some risk.</i>

542
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:13,383
[Frankie] <i>Man, I almost forgot</i>
<i>why I got out of this business.</i>

543
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,383
<i>Shit gets so dark so quick.</i>

544
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:20,958
Oh, shit,
we got ground sensors here, boys.

545
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:23,093
[Santiago] <i>Did you hit one?</i>

546
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,510
I don't know, I'm not sure.

547
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:32,298
[man speaking Spanish]

548
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:41,261
Benny, I got two guys
on motorbikes coming your way.

549
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:44,665
[William] <i>Hold tight, Benny.</i>
<i>I'm trying to get out there to cover you.</i>

550
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,261
[informant, in Spanish]
Good afternoon, Mr. Lorea.

551
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:58,421
[motorbikes approaching]

552
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,841
[in English] A stock boy job
at Walmart's starting

553
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,671
to look pretty good right now, boys.

554
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,128
[in Spanish] It looks good to me.

555
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:12,213
Good.

556
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,126
-[bookkeeper] Okay.
-[slams]

557
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,133
Thank you, sir.

558
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:25,505
[indistinct chatter]
[in English]
I'm clear. They're coming back to you.

559
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:34,341
[sighs] Let's get the fuck outta here.

560
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:39,168
[all laugh]

561
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:41,125
[Frankie] You were gonna piss yourself.

562
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:43,343
I was getting onto the déjà vu part, man.

563
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,011
-[all laugh]
-[dance music playing over radio]

564
00:33:46,755 --> 00:33:48,085
[William] So what's the plan?

565
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,800
Are their guys prepared to operate
across the border?

566
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:52,668
What's the scope of this thing?

567
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:54,705
Sunday soft hit is the way to do it.

568
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:57,378
Otherwise, you bring in an army,
you'd start a fucking war up there.

569
00:33:57,463 --> 00:34:01,133
Mm-hmm. So, when do you need
to present to the agency down here?

570
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:03,798
[exhales]

571
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:06,511
[clicks tongue]
I'm not sure I wanna tell them.

572
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:07,876
Why?

573
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,958
[Santiago] We saw the place.

574
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:11,545
It's full of holes.

575
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:14,213
So maybe we don't tell them...

576
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,550
-[Benny chuckles]
-...and we do this thing ourselves.

577
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,511
What?

578
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:22,458
-[Santiago] What?
-[Benny sighs]

579
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:24,546
Now, we each took 17 grand...

580
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,920
to help the narcotics unit map out
and plan this fuckin' thing.

581
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:31,335
I told you I wasn't even comfortable
helping them do it.

582
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,455
Now you want us to do it by ourselves?
Kill a bunch of fuckin' narcos?

583
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:37,586
If we hit that window, like you said,
when they're at church,

584
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:40,343
nobody but Lorea gets killed.

585
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,375
[Santiago] And I'm okay with that.

586
00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:46,093
[Tom] Does the agency down here
even know about this?

587
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,010
-What do you mean?
-Come on, man!

588
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:49,168
Don't fuck around.

589
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,053
Who paid our fees?

590
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,760
It's complicated, technically...

591
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,340
you guys were paid through an LLC.

592
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:59,053
Mm, no, not that complicated.

593
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,170
It's $100,000.
Where the fuck did it come from?

594
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:02,205
[men laughing]

595
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:05,513
[speaking Portuguese]

596
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:09,551
[Santiago] I'll get the bill.
Thanks.

597
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:13,878
Great trip, boys. [sighs]

598
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:16,673
It's turning out
to be some full-on cowboy shit.

599
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,590
[Tom clears throat]

600
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:27,008
Whose money is it, huh?

601
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,835
-It was my money.
-Jeez.

602
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:31,381
[Frankie, in Spanish]
What were you thinking?

603
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,343
[in English] What?
Does that change anything?

604
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:34,835
Yeah, man.

605
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:37,256
You fucking lied to us.

606
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:39,208
No, I didn't lie to you.

607
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:41,006
[softly]
I asked you guys to come down here,

608
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,168
do reconnaissance, and make a plan.

609
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,670
Now, we can execute that plan alone

610
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:48,335
and take all of the money,

611
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:52,586
or you guys can fuck off,
and I'll bring the team from down here in.

612
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:57,211
But I assure you, if I do that,
this fucker will find out about it,

613
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,706
and he'll be gone, and I need this guy.

614
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:02,506
You know how many fucking bad men
are out there all over the world?

615
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,553
Yeah, well, this is my last one.

616
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,170
-[both chuckle]
-[Santiago] And you may not believe it,

617
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,665
but I have been here
for the last three years of my life,

618
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:12,955
trying to make a difference,
but it's a fucking mess.

619
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,546
And it's all because of Lorea.

620
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:19,383
The thought of leaving everything
we've done behind for the last 17 years,

621
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:20,915
with nothing to show for it--

622
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:22,835
-Fuck you, nothing to show for it.
-[scoffs]

623
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:24,625
Look, if...

624
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:26,923
If we had accomplished half the things
that we've accomplished
in any other profession,
we'd be set for life.

625
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,706
Hey, man, that's the deal we cut.

626
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:33,961
-Well, it's a shitty deal.
-Yeah, well...

627
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,085
Because this man's a goddamn hero,

628
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,261
and he can't even send his kids
to college.

629
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,880
And Fish's the most talented pilot I know,
and he's grounded on a bullshit coke rap.

630
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:45,713
And how many times can your brother
get the shit knocked out of him for--

631
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:47,876
I didn't get the shit beat out of me.
I won that fight.

632
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:48,803
Sorry, Benny.

633
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,798
And how many more pep talks
can you possibly give?

634
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:54,128
I'm done, man.

635
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,840
Both knees are shot.

636
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:58,591
That neck operation I got last year
made the whole thing worse.

637
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:01,263
So, the question is,

638
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:04,128
do we finally get to use our skills
for our own benefit

639
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:06,166
and actually change something?

640
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:15,421
[engine revs]

641
00:37:19,463 --> 00:37:20,633
So, are we doing this?

642
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:22,708
[Tom]
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

643
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,630
This guy doesn't come through
with the one key piece of intel

644
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,013
we need to make this decision.

645
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:27,918
For all we know,

646
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:29,835
she could be setting us up
to get her brother back.

647
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:31,171
We'll know tomorrow.

648
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:34,298
She should have been recording
that whole thing today.

649
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:37,878
All right, if it does come back clean,

650
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,921
how would you do
the Sunday morning version?

651
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:45,551
-I haven't thought about it.
-Bullshit, you can't help yourself.

652
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:48,961
All right.

653
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,626
In the first pop, you'd have 40 minutes
to get in, get the job done,

654
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,763
and get out before the family
comes home from church.

655
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:54,708
That's a hard out.

656
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:56,456
We need to breach the fence,

657
00:37:56,546 --> 00:37:59,086
sweep the premises,
find and subdue the guards,
scrub the hard drives
in the security room,

658
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:06,206
get rid of Lorea, find the money,
pack the money into 18 hundred-pound bags,

659
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:08,756
and then hoof it half a mile
to the nearest vehicle.

660
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,258
There's only two ways out:

661
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:12,668
the fence in the front,
or over the mountain we came down,

662
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:13,875
and I'm too old for that.

663
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,546
We need to use one of their vans.

664
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,383
[Frankie]
There were two vans in the courtyard.

665
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,420
But if the family uses those vans
to go to church, then we got nothing.

666
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:23,795
So we need another van.

667
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:27,383
-Can your girl work that out?
-I can ask her.

668
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:31,878
Still got your aviation guy down here?

669
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:35,418
'Cause we would need
a heavy-lift helicopter in 32 hours

670
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:37,665
to get us over the Andes and to the ocean.

671
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:39,923
I don't know, but I'll give him a call.

672
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:44,008
[Benny] Oh, yeah! Big dog is back!

673
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:46,551
Redfly's gonna be rich, boys!

674
00:38:47,421 --> 00:38:48,631
[laughs]

675
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:50,013
Now we're talkin'.

676
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:57,298
-[upbeat music playing over radio]
-[indistinct chatter]

677
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,418
[in Spanish] Hello.

678
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:09,708
<i>Hola.</i>

679
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:12,303
<i>¿Señor?</i>

-Thank you. Have a good day.

-[Santiago, in English] Thank you.
-That's it?

[Santiago] I don't know.

684
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,670
[in Spanish] Miss, two coffees, please.

685
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:37,415
-[in English] My brother.
-[Santiago] Yeah.

686
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:40,463
I might need you to do one more thing
for me.

687
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,455
Can you get an extra van...

688
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:45,916
into the compound, Sunday morning?

689
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:49,006
If I did that,
they're going to know it's me.

690
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:52,756
And everyone who works for him
ends up dead, sooner or later.

691
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,010
If you can get me an extra van
in there Sunday morning...

692
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:01,093
I will get you and your brother
out of the country

693
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,881
with new papers and money.

694
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,260
How much?
[chuckles softly]

695
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:10,171
Two million.

696
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,261
Two million?
[Santiago] Yes.

697
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,668
And you'll only have a couple hours
to get my brother?

698
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:17,513
I'll find a way.

699
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:22,343
But I need that van inside those gates.

700
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:30,005
[sighs] Okay.

701
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,798
-Yeah?
-[informant] Yes. I'll get the van.

702
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,380
But if we're not gone forever
after you make your move, we are dead.

703
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:39,551
You'll be gone.

704
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:43,511
Yeah.

705
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:47,706
Thank you.

706
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:08,836
[Santiago] Hey, fellas.

707
00:41:11,796 --> 00:41:12,916
Take a look at this.

708
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,710
[chuckles] Jesus, Pope!

709
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:20,755
-What the hell were you planning here?
-Exactly this.

710
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:22,963
Every single gun, bullet,

711
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,256
and fucking toothpick here's been sourced
in-country.

712
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,918
The idea is to pin this
on a local rival gang.

713
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:33,091
Now, who was it
that didn't trust this lady?

714
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:37,878
'Cause not only is she going to get us
that extra van, but she got us this.

715
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:42,915
There's our man, Lorea.

716
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,760
And, oh!

717
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:46,961
Look at what's there behind him.

718
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,206
-[Lorea speaking on recording]
-Looks like money to me.

719
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:52,086
-There's gotta be about 35 million there.
-We don't know that.

720
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:53,381
Whatever it is, it's a lot.

721
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:55,711
What are you gonna do
with your share, huh?

722
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:58,376
Never spend your money
until it's in your pocket, Benjamin.

723
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:00,923
[Benny] Well, I'm just sayin',
I'm gonna get that Ferrari, man.

724
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:03,255
-[Frankie] How original.
-What about the bird?

725
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,011
Well, he said if we're there
with three million bucks, he'll be there.

726
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,710
So we got a bird, we got a van,

727
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:13,958
we got Lorea confirmed
in the house with the money.

728
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:20,455
All right, give me-- give me a minute.

729
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:23,133
[sighs]

730
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,711
[Frankie exhales]

731
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:37,628
Uh, you know, if you had pulled this shit
when we were active duty,

732
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:39,213
I would have court-martialed your ass.

733
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:42,668
Look, why don't we all
just have a dinner tonight,

734
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:45,295
get drunk, on me,
and you all can go home in the morning?

735
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:47,961
Nah, fuck that.

736
00:42:48,796 --> 00:42:50,416
[sighs] I can't.

737
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:52,045
Somehow, I just...

738
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:54,126
[sighs]

739
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:56,756
...ended up against it here. You know?

740
00:42:57,505 --> 00:43:00,125
I'm burning through my pension.
Molly's job doesn't cut it.

741
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,300
I can't sell condos
to save my fucking life.

742
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,050
The only thing I have
is taking care of these girls.

743
00:43:06,505 --> 00:43:07,375
[Santiago] Yeah.

744
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,375
Yeah, I understand that.

745
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,298
Fuck, I missed this.

746
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:18,418
It's like they take your best 20 years,
and then spit you out.

747
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,126
Yeah.

748
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:22,416
[Tom] I just can't stop thinking
about the mistakes.

749
00:43:24,088 --> 00:43:26,878
-[Santiago] What mistakes?
-[sighs] Fuck, man.

750
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:29,091
All of 'em.

751
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:33,126
-Didn't get better when you got out?
-[Tom] No.

752
00:43:34,213 --> 00:43:37,133
Only thing that made it feel better
is when you put a gun in my hand.

753
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:40,633
[clicks tongue]
So, I guess that's what we'll do.

754
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:42,415
[sighs]

755
00:43:45,671 --> 00:43:46,631
[Santiago sighs]

756
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,258
[Tom] <i>All right, first things first:</i>

757
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:55,168
<i>safety.</i>

758
00:43:56,005 --> 00:43:58,205
There is no medevac.
There is no ground support.

759
00:43:58,296 --> 00:44:00,756
Any injuries we sustain,
we're walking out with.

760
00:44:01,046 --> 00:44:03,626
Be mindful,
each of you has a medical kit in your bag.

761
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:05,376
Number two:

762
00:44:05,463 --> 00:44:07,923
you cannot go back
to your normal life after tonight.

763
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:12,048
Make no mistake about it.
What we are about to do is criminal.

764
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:16,011
We do not have the flag on our shoulders,
and no amount of bullshit

765
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,758
that we tell ourselves
is gonna change that.

766
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:19,795
If we do our job right,

767
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,710
we will be committing one murder
and one armed robbery.

768
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,170
You guys need to own the fact
that you are desecrating

769
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:26,955
most of the oaths you ever took.

770
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:29,958
-[Frankie sighs]
-[Tom] Third:

771
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,260
family.

772
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,013
If they don't go to church,
or if they come home early,

773
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,758
it's an abort. Full stop.
They are not who we came for.

774
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,590
And lastly,

775
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:40,553
it's not too late to go home.
We had an agreement with Pope,

776
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,093
and we fulfilled that.

777
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:47,625
Any man here who wants to walk away now
can do so knowing they're the best of us.

778
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,091
But it's gotta be now.

779
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:56,803
I wanna make sure
we're not leaving that house

780
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,380
without taking care of Lorea.

781
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,553
If he's there like he's supposed to be,
we'll get him.

782
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,880
We leave at 0300.

783
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:06,836
[Benny] Hooah.

784
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:09,588
[rain pouring]

785
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,381
[Benny over radio] <i>It's a good thing</i>
<i>these guys are so devout.</i>

786
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:18,513
Our dad used to say,

787
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:21,088
"When it's raining, it means
God didn't need us in church today."

788
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:25,381
He also said you go to heaven
for the climate and hell for the company.

789
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
[Benny]
<i>Actually, I think Mark Twain said that.</i>

790
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:30,343
All right, keep the radio clear,
let's stay awake here.

791
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,086
[Tom]
<i>How many is that getting in? Count it.</i>

792
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:36,378
Seven getting in the van.

793
00:45:37,255 --> 00:45:38,625
[Santiago] <i>Anybody see Lorea?</i>

794
00:45:39,255 --> 00:45:41,205
Negative. We never saw him come out.

795
00:45:41,796 --> 00:45:44,796
The wife and two kids are in
with a single driver.

796
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:47,296
<i>The family's left the building.</i>

797
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:50,585
<i>Repeat, family are all clear.</i>

798
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:54,458
All right, let's get ready here.

799
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:00,918
Damn, Pope, this lady is a keeper.

800
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:03,255
Punctual, smart, and brave as shit.

801
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:12,713
-[in Spanish] Good day.
-What's this?

802
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:16,338
I'm here to drop off this van,
and then my brother is taking me home.

803
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:18,801
That idiot didn't tell me.

804
00:46:28,588 --> 00:46:30,208
[Benny, in English] She's in. She's in.

805
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:31,456
[Tom] <i>Here we go.</i>

806
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:33,506
<i>Ben, you're first hit.</i>
<i>Call when it's secure.</i>

807
00:46:33,755 --> 00:46:36,165
<i>With this rain,</i>
<i>the guards are gonna be inside.</i>

808
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:37,666
[Benny] <i>Roger.</i>

809
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,800
-[Benny] <i>All clear, she's gone.</i>
<i>-</i>[Tom] <i>Copy.</i>

810
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,923
[William] <i>All right, we're going in.</i>

811
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:25,875

Hold, Benny. Hold.

<i>Threat in the TV room.</i>

821
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:09,208
We're gonna go around the side.

00:49:16,296 --> 00:49:17,756
[Benny] <i>What's going on in there?</i>

824
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:20,008
[Santiago] All clear, Benny.
Eyes out for Lorea.

825
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:21,588
He sure as fuck heard us now.

826
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:22,551
[Benny] <i>I'm coming in.</i>

Setting charges to the security room.

[muffled groaning]

829
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:33,206
[Tom] <i>What was that?</i>

830
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:34,666
[Benny] We had to shoot the second guard
in the leg.

831
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:37,625
-They're taking him to the kitchen.
-[Tom] <i>Coming down.</i>

832
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:38,593
[Benny] Come on.

<i>She said he never leaves.</i>

837

-[bags thud]
-[William] He's gone.

844

[Frankie sighs]
Your girl gave us up, Pope.

846
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,213
We gotta get the fuck outta here.

-Like a serious fuck-up.
-[chuckles]

851
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:56,510
No.

852
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,170
Paint.

853
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:00,375
[sighs]
The house is the safe.

854
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,588
The house is the fucking safe.

855
00:52:40,463 --> 00:52:42,013
[William] Benny, help me move this.
Come on.

856
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,758
-[Benny] I'll take the edge.
-[Tom] Over there.

857
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:45,958
Go, come on. Come on, man. Come on!

858
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,086
-[Benny] Holy shit!
-[Frankie] Come on.

859
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:50,761
-[Tom grunts]
-[William] Go. Move, move.

860
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:52,421
[Benny] C'mon.

861
00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:54,376
-[Tom] Oh, my God!
-[Santiago] Fish, I'm up.

862
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:57,131
[Santiago] Come on, guys!

863
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,960
-[laughs]
-[Santiago] Holy shit!

864
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,880
What'd I tell you, boys?

865
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:05,383
-Jesus Christ!
-[Benny continues laughing]

866
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:09,343
[Santiago] Fucking God! Look at it!

867
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:11,631
-It goes all the way up!
-[William] Let's go!

868
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:12,633
[whoops]

869
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,798
We're gonna need some bags.

870
00:53:21,005 --> 00:53:24,455
-[Benny] I'll get another bag!
-[William] Keep it coming.

871
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:28,168
What's wrong?

872
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:31,255
If the money's still here,
it means he's still here.

873
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:32,378
He's gone, man.

874
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:34,165
We got more!

875
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:35,455
[William] Back wall, too.

876
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,916
[Tom] Just concentrate.

877
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,625
Oh, we're just gettin' rich!
[Santiago] How much time we got?

878
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,708
-[panting]
-[Benny and William] Eight minutes.

879
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:45,091
Millers, enough of that over there.
We gotta start getting this shit
to the van.

880
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,011
Yeah, we got this.

881
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,383
-Come on, bro.
-[Tom] Keep your eyes open.

882
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:56,755
[Benny] Yeah, bitches! [laughs, whooping]

883
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,800
[Benny] Here, take these.
I'm gonna go get the van.

884
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,010
-Meet me there.
-[William] Yes, sir.

885
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:05,048
[Frankie] Careful.

886
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,300
-[keys jangle]
-Classic.

887
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:25,963
[Frankie grunts]

888
00:54:31,296 --> 00:54:32,546
Jesus Christ.

889
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,423
-[laughing] Help us, man!
-Come on! Come on!

890
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:38,053
Come on. Over there.

891
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:43,763
-[Santiago grunts]
-Holy shit! [laughs]

892
00:54:53,796 --> 00:54:57,506
[both laughing]

893
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,760
[William] We're gonna need more bags.
See if you can find something.

894
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:01,758
On it.

895
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:04,705
I tell you one thing, man,

896
00:55:04,796 --> 00:55:06,506
you can tell your girls
they can stop studying

897
00:55:06,588 --> 00:55:08,838
'cause Daddy's just gonna buy their way
into Harvard!

898
00:55:10,296 --> 00:55:13,086
[laughing] Holy shit,
this is a fuckload of money!

899
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:15,456
Grab some of those and go.

900
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:16,956
How are we on time?

901
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:18,546
We got time for a couple more loads.
-You sure?
-Grab those and bring 'em down.

902
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,460
[Frankie] Guys!

903
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,008
I got another wall over here!

904
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,838
-[sighs] Holy shit!
-Shit!

905
00:55:27,671 --> 00:55:28,551
It's everywhere.

906
00:55:28,713 --> 00:55:30,343
[sighs] Well, fuck me!
It's the whole fucking house.

907
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:38,883
[William] What's up?

908
00:55:38,963 --> 00:55:40,423
The van's full, man!

909
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,796
It's all good. We gotta go.

910
00:55:46,463 --> 00:55:47,673
What the hell are you doing?

911
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:50,086
Stop digging more out.
We got all this to deal with.

912
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:51,261
A couple more loads.

913
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:53,761
[sighs]

914
00:55:55,463 --> 00:55:58,763
You know, in the ten years
I've been working with you, Tom,

915
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:00,918
you have never missed a hard out!

916
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:04,378
I gave us a 15-minute cushion.

917
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,460
It's 12 minutes to the church,
a 40-minute service, 12 minutes back.

918
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:10,915
Add 5 minutes
to load in and out of the van,

919
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,795
and we can subtract 7 to beat them
to the exit route.

920
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,760
We will be fine!

921
00:56:14,463 --> 00:56:17,303
All right?
God damn it, look at all this money!

922
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:19,421
Just a couple more loads!

923
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:22,666
Fuck this!

924
00:56:26,588 --> 00:56:28,128
Time's up. We gotta go.

925
00:56:28,921 --> 00:56:31,131
I want one more sweep for Lorea.

926
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:33,763
All right?

927
00:56:36,421 --> 00:56:37,881
And then we burn it all down.

928
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,760
[Frankie] Okay,

929
00:56:46,463 --> 00:56:48,173
I'll get these last one loaded down there,

930
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,625
and you call out when you're ready
to light it up.

931
00:56:55,213 --> 00:56:57,383
[sighs] Move. Move!

932
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:02,343
[breathing heavily]

933
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:34,046
[William] Come on, we gotta go!

934
00:57:35,463 --> 00:57:36,843
-Lighting it up.
-[lighter clicks]

935
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:40,461
[Lorea shouts in Spanish]

936
00:57:49,755 --> 00:57:51,165
What are we shooting at in here?

937
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,170
Is that Lorea?

938
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:00,131
He's dead.

939
00:58:01,463 --> 00:58:02,303
Good.

940
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,920
[panting] I'm hit.

941
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,381
Shit!

942
00:58:07,963 --> 00:58:09,093
[groans, inhales sharply]

943
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:10,671
-Take it easy.
-[Santiago] Where?

944
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,295
[grunts] Left side.

945
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:14,758
Did it go through?

946
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:16,128
[Tom] Yeah, it went through.

947
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:17,463
-[William] I'll be fine.
-[Tom] It'll be okay.

948
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:19,626
-[William] Get the clot kit.
-[Tom] Straight through.

949
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:20,843
You'll be okay.

950
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:22,171
You'll be all right.

951
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:23,085
Just breathe.

952
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,511
I'm okay.

953
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,840
All right. Let go.

954
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:33,045
-Told you this was a stupid idea.
-Yeah, you sure did.

955
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,920
[William grunting]

956
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,343
Sunday school's over, boys.

957
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,801
They're back.

958
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:41,915
Oh, shit!

959
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:46,841
-The family?
-No, the first shift of guards.

960
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:48,381
-You okay?
-[William] I'm all right.

961
00:58:48,463 --> 00:58:49,593
You gonna be able to move?

962
00:58:49,671 --> 00:58:50,961
-We don't got a stretcher.
-Yeah.

963
00:58:51,255 --> 00:58:53,045
Just help me get my kit back on.

964
00:58:56,588 --> 00:58:58,458
All right, we can each take
a backpack of cash,

965
00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:02,005
we go out through the back
into the jungle, and we're gone.
-I'll cover the cost of the operation.
-Fuck that.

966
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:08,338
No.<i> </i>We are bringing Ironhead home safe.

967
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,091
Not dragging him through the jungle.

968
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,421
And we're not leaving them
any of this fucking money.

969
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:15,211
Right, so we burn it all down and go.

970
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:18,126
There's about $100 million
for them waiting in the van out there.

971
00:59:18,213 --> 00:59:19,803
We need to hunt and shoot quickly.

972
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:22,505
Call out your kills.
I don't want any fuckin' surprises.

973
00:59:22,588 --> 00:59:24,798
-Got it?
-All right.

974
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,210
-Let's do this.
-[grunts]

975
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:29,375
[Tom] You two go that way,
we'll come down the front.

976
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:31,053
I'm all right.

977
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,590
Let's just do it.
All right.

978
00:59:35,796 --> 00:59:36,626
All right.

979
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,420
[sighs]

980
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,166
[Santiago] Let's go.

Come on! Let's go!

-[Tom] What?
-What do you mean, what?

1005
01:02:26,296 --> 01:02:29,336
That was a shit job back there, man.
We don't leave messes like that!

1006
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:35,301
[Frankie] <i>What do we do up here?</i>
<i>I've got the family waiting to go in.</i>

-You made it.
-[pilot] Count on me.

1020
01:04:17,213 --> 01:04:18,053
Mosquito bite?

1021
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:20,085
[William] Yeah, a little one.

1022
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:22,128
-Feels worse than it looks.
-[pilot laughs]

1023
01:04:24,171 --> 01:04:26,171
Now how the hell are we all gonna fit
in that?

1024
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:29,508
-[pilot] Come when you're ready.
-[man over radio] <i>Copy.</i>
-[helicopter blades whirring]
-[William] Feel free to count it.

1025
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:33,508
I know where to find you.

1026
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,511
Voilà!

1027
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:02,301
[shouts] It won't all fit in the net!

1028
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,380
We gotta get the rest on it inside!

1029
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:11,878
[both speaking Spanish]

1030
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:15,415
I don't know if that scale's fucked up,

1031
01:05:15,505 --> 01:05:18,085
but he's telling me
we got 6,000 pounds here.

1032
01:05:18,171 --> 01:05:20,761
That's $250 million.

1033
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:22,668
We stole 250 million?

1034
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:25,213
I'm definitely getting that Ferrari!

1035
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,256
-Are you sure?
-Let's go!

1036
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:29,008
If that scale is even close
to being right,

1037
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:30,458
we're gonna have a weight issue.

1038
01:05:30,546 --> 01:05:33,626
What's the issue?
This helo can carry 9,000 pounds.

1039
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:37,505
That's 9,000 at 2,000 feet.

1040
01:05:37,588 --> 01:05:41,378
If we want to get to the ocean,
we gotta fly over the fucking Andes, man.

1041
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,840
Are we really leaving $200 million
on the fucking runway?

1042
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:51,050
Okay, she'll make it. Let's go!

1043
01:05:52,546 --> 01:05:55,376
What's your plan for her?
We're already overweight as it is.

1044
01:05:56,046 --> 01:05:58,756
We promised them a ride
over the border into Peru.

1045
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:01,126
And we're gonna stand by that!

1046
01:07:05,213 --> 01:07:08,633
Okay, we're gonna let you go now.

1047
01:07:08,713 --> 01:07:09,633
Thank you.

1048
01:07:09,713 --> 01:07:11,383
[Tom] I just need to know something.

1049
01:07:11,963 --> 01:07:13,133
What's my name?

1050
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:15,463
I-- I don't know.

1051
01:07:15,546 --> 01:07:17,956
What about your buddy back there?
What's his name?

1052
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:20,165
I don't know.

1053
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,170
He said he couldn't tell me.

1054
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:26,625
Okay, I want you to be real careful...
about what you're about to say

1055
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:30,713
because the only thing
that ties us to them is you.

1056
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,920
Now, when you finally had sex,

1057
01:07:37,005 --> 01:07:40,085
and you rolled over and looked him
in the eye and said,

1058
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:42,801
"What's your real name?"
What did he say?

1059
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,090
That never happened.

1060
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,960
I can just go ask him.

1061
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:48,338
He never told me where he was from.

1062
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:50,668
He said that you served together...

1063
01:07:52,296 --> 01:07:53,546
and that you were honest.

1064
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,210
Why'd he say that?
Because I asked him if...

1065
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:02,006
if he wasn't afraid of you cheating him.

1066
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:03,758
That's why.

1067
01:08:04,588 --> 01:08:05,838
Everything all right?

1068
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,210
No!

1069
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:15,761
[in Spanish]
Here's three million dollars.

1070
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:20,256
And two tickets
with visas to Sydney, Australia.

1071
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:25,586
On the way to the airport,
stop at this shipping company.

1072
01:08:26,296 --> 01:08:29,706
Make sure to send the boxes
to this hotel in Sydney.

1073
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:34,050
You know that's a lot more
than 75 million dollars in there.

1074
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,050
[in English] What does that mean?

1075
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,210
It's not just Lorea's money in there.

1076
01:08:40,046 --> 01:08:42,126
A lot more people
are gonna come looking after you.

1077
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:47,303
I can deal with that.
But do not stay in South America

1078
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,420
because they will find you
and they will kill you.

1079
01:08:51,088 --> 01:08:53,008
[in Spanish]
Promise me that you won't stay here.

1080
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:53,958
-Yes!
-Promise me!

1081
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,126
I promise you.

1082
01:08:56,005 --> 01:08:58,455
[in English] How... How do I contact you?

1083
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:00,005
You can't.

1084
01:09:03,296 --> 01:09:05,506
You did everything right.

1085
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:07,553
You deserve this.

1086
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:12,673
[in Spanish] Take care of yourselves.

1087
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:14,045
[brother, in English] Thank you.

1088
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:15,708
Go!

1089
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:39,756
She's lying.

1090
01:09:41,546 --> 01:09:42,546
No, she's not.

1091
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,760
There are consequences to this shit.

1092
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,301
You know what we should have done?

1093
01:09:54,505 --> 01:09:56,455
That's one you wouldn't come back from.

[Frankie] I'm gonna try
between these two bigger peaks.

I don't know.

-What does that mean?
-It means we're losing fucking money.

1120

You wanna leave $50 million
in the middle of the jungle?

01:28:55,005 --> 01:28:56,875
Yeah, it's on us now!

1355
01:28:58,963 --> 01:29:01,763
[Frankie shouts] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1356

-[mules bray]
-[Frankie shouts]

1357
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:07,296
[Santiago] Look at the mules.

1358
01:29:09,255 --> 01:29:11,295
Well, if we can get over this,

1359
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,630
it should be all downhill
to the ocean from here.

1360
01:29:17,755 --> 01:29:19,045
[men grunting]

1361
01:29:23,296 --> 01:29:24,956
[Santiago] I got it. I got it. I got it.

1362
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:30,761
[both pant]

1363
01:29:32,171 --> 01:29:34,261
[Santiago] All right, come on up!

1364
01:29:36,588 --> 01:29:38,168
-Nice work.
-You, too.

1365
01:29:41,505 --> 01:29:43,505
Look, I talked a lot of shit back there.

1366
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:44,758
I didn't mean that.

1367
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,630
-Don't worry about it.
-No, no, it's...

1368
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,340
This is on me.

1369
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:53,046
-It's... all on me.
-No, man, it's...

1370
01:29:54,338 --> 01:29:55,588
I'm on the hook for this.

1371
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:58,920
You know? It is what it is. [sniffles]

1372
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,550
Yeah, it is what it is.

1373
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,300
-I <i>am </i>a bit of a dick, though.
-[chuckles]

1374

[sighs]

1375
01:30:29,088 --> 01:30:31,588
You could freeze an Eskimo's asshole
out here.

1376
01:30:33,046 --> 01:30:34,256
I demand a fire.

1377
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:38,045
[sighs] We cold camp.

1378
01:30:40,505 --> 01:30:42,505
[sighs, sniffles]

[lighter clicks]

1381
01:30:54,005 --> 01:30:55,005
Fuck you.

1382
01:30:56,713 --> 01:30:58,423
This is my "fuck you" money.

1383
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:01,545
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

1384
01:31:05,296 --> 01:31:06,506
[chuckles]

1385
01:31:06,588 --> 01:31:08,588
[laughing] We don't have enough men
to carry this money,

1386
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,261
so we might as well be warm. [sniffles]

1387
01:31:22,671 --> 01:31:23,841
[lighter clicks]

1388
01:31:24,421 --> 01:31:25,301
Oh, Jesus.

1389
01:31:26,255 --> 01:31:28,125
[Frankie] Jesus Christ. [laughs]

[all laughing]

1391
01:31:31,921 --> 01:31:33,011
[Benny] Ah.

1392
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:44,633
-[Frankie] That's more like it.

-[Tom] Oh, shit! Shit.
-[William] Ah, Fuck.

1402
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:35,756
[Benny] I'm hit!

1403
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,920
[gunshots]

1404
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:42,131
-[William] Benny, you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Just grazed my shoulder.

1405
01:32:42,838 --> 01:32:44,418
Shooter's up on the ridge line.

1406
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:51,510
Oh, he likes me so much.
I'll stay here, hold his fire.

1407
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:52,708
You guys go around the side.

1408
01:32:54,255 --> 01:32:55,835
Pope, can you step out?

1409
01:32:56,713 --> 01:32:57,923
Work up the trailhead.

1410
01:32:58,546 --> 01:32:59,456
All right.

1411
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:02,005
Flank right, make sure no one else
is coming up below.

1412
01:33:03,046 --> 01:33:04,046
I'll cut up behind you.

1413
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:06,126
Benny, you all right?

1414
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:09,883
[Benny] Yeah, I'm fine. We'll hold
down here until you get into position.

1415
01:33:12,213 --> 01:33:14,093
[gunfire continues]

1416
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:28,423
[gunshot]

1417
01:33:30,046 --> 01:33:32,006
I think Pope's in position right now.

1418
01:33:32,088 --> 01:33:33,128
Yeah, let's move.

1419
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:36,341

1425
01:35:03,546 --> 01:35:04,706
[Benny] Tom!
Tom!

1426
01:35:06,421 --> 01:35:09,261
Tom. Come on... Come on.

1427
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:20,958
[sobbing] Come on, Tom. Come on, man.

1428
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:23,586
Come on, man. Come on...

1429
01:35:30,338 --> 01:35:31,878
[William] Let me see. Let me see.

1430
01:35:34,921 --> 01:35:36,421
[Benny] Oh, my God!

1431
01:35:49,796 --> 01:35:51,086
Let's get him wrapped up.
We need to keep moving.

1432
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,800
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-[sighs]

1433
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,670
You're a heartless son of a bitch!

1434
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:05,625
It was your little fire
that got him fucking killed!

1435
01:36:11,005 --> 01:36:12,335
[shouts]

1436
01:36:14,338 --> 01:36:15,258
[groans]

1437
01:36:16,213 --> 01:36:17,303
[quietly] Stop it.

1438
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,550
[both grunting]

1439
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:21,340
Stop this shit. Stop this shit.

1440
01:36:21,421 --> 01:36:23,301
-[Benny shouting]
-[Santiago] Fucking stop this!

1441
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,760
Stop this shit! Stop it!

1442
01:36:25,838 --> 01:36:28,668
-Stop this shit!
-[William] Fuck you, Benny! Fuck you!

1443
01:36:29,546 --> 01:36:32,256
It wasn't the fire that gave us away.

1444
01:36:33,671 --> 01:36:34,841
That kid was from the village.

1445
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:38,633
He's been tracking us for days.

1446
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,170
He obviously wanted a clear shot at Tom.

1447
01:36:43,838 --> 01:36:44,798
He wanted him.

1448
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,920
But we do have to get
the fuck out of here,

1449
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:53,165
and we are taking
all of that money with us.

1450
01:36:53,796 --> 01:36:55,626
Tom's family deserves it!

1451
01:36:56,755 --> 01:36:57,705
And so do we.

1452
01:37:01,255 --> 01:37:03,295
All right, let's wrap him up.
We carry him down.

1453
01:37:28,255 --> 01:37:29,625
Rest in peace, brother.

1454
01:37:33,338 --> 01:37:35,298
You rest in peace. [sniffles]

Yeah.

[William] You heard me.

1498
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:48,211
As many as I had to.

1499
01:40:48,713 --> 01:40:50,173
Why would you ever wanna know that?

1500
01:40:53,463 --> 01:40:55,463
-Forty-three.
-Jesus!

1501
01:40:56,588 --> 01:40:57,458

Yep.

[Benny] The boat's there.

1510
01:41:39,963 --> 01:41:41,463
I gave him half the money.

1511
01:41:41,755 --> 01:41:42,795
I hope he waits.

1512
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,590
I didn't go into town,

1513
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:49,006
but it looks like
whoever's in charge there...

1514
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:53,460
has a... kindergarten army
that's looking for us.

1515
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:56,550
-[William] How many of them?
-Two or three pros,

20 heavily-armed teenagers.

1517

What about the next town over?

It's over 100 miles to the south.

1519

I'm sure they've got
every town covered anyway.

1520
01:42:07,296 --> 01:42:09,506
Must be what's left of Lorea's guys.

1521
01:42:09,796 --> 01:42:10,916
So we go through 'em.

[sighs]

1523
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:14,760
Through them?

1524
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:16,513
What, do you mean we mow them all down?

1525
01:42:16,588 --> 01:42:17,758
What's the alternative here?

1526
01:42:17,838 --> 01:42:18,708

01:42:18,796 --> 01:42:22,206
I'm not prepared
to wipe out every teenager in that town

1528
01:42:22,463 --> 01:42:24,513
just to get through with this cargo.

1529
01:42:24,796 --> 01:42:25,916
[Santiago] This cargo?

1530
01:42:27,296 --> 01:42:28,756
What about that cargo?

1531
01:42:29,796 --> 01:42:31,086
Will you do it for him?

1532
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,380
Tom died for this money,

1533
01:42:34,463 --> 01:42:36,093
and we're not leaving this country
without it!

1534
01:42:36,171 --> 01:42:38,801
He didn't die <i>for </i>that money,
he died <i>because </i>of it!

1535
01:42:45,255 --> 01:42:46,625
[Benny] They're just kids, man.

1536
01:42:46,713 --> 01:42:48,343
Can't we carry it out through the dark?

1537
01:42:48,796 --> 01:42:50,916
[William] It's over 100 bags.
There's no way.

1538
01:42:51,838 --> 01:42:53,088
Let me talk to him.

1539
01:42:54,755 --> 01:42:55,625
[sighs]

1540
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:02,878
Look, Benny's telling us these are kids,
man.

1541
01:43:07,296 --> 01:43:10,336
I can't believe...
I can't believe I let this happen.

1542
01:43:11,921 --> 01:43:14,591
Look, we all came here
of our own free will.

1543
01:43:16,171 --> 01:43:17,051
Yeah, but...

1544
01:43:17,546 --> 01:43:20,796
I thought we could...
I thought we could do this.

1545
01:43:21,671 --> 01:43:22,511
[sighs]

1546
01:43:23,046 --> 01:43:24,126
Yeah.

1547
01:43:25,588 --> 01:43:27,168
And we got what we deserved.

1548
01:43:29,463 --> 01:43:30,423
I'm sorry.

1549
01:43:31,755 --> 01:43:32,585
Yeah, me, too.

1550
01:43:33,796 --> 01:43:35,586
-But we can't do this.
-I know.

1551
01:43:36,421 --> 01:43:37,381
I know.

1552
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:51,511
We can't just... go through 'em.

1553
01:43:52,421 --> 01:43:53,921
I don't know what I was saying.

1554
01:43:55,505 --> 01:43:56,375
It's all right.

1555
01:43:57,088 --> 01:43:58,588
We've just gotta get Tom home.

1556
01:43:59,546 --> 01:44:00,586
That's all that matters.

1557
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:03,260
How are we gonna do that?

1558
01:44:03,671 --> 01:44:05,171
[Santiago] We keep carrying him down.

1559
01:44:06,088 --> 01:44:08,208
We fill our days packs
with whatever we can...

1560
01:44:09,088 --> 01:44:11,048
Whatever we can carry, and that's it.

1561
01:44:12,005 --> 01:44:13,505
What do we do with the rest of it?

1562
01:44:22,088 --> 01:44:23,088
[Santiago sighs]

1563
01:44:32,171 --> 01:44:33,131
Fuck.

1564
01:44:34,088 --> 01:44:35,128
[grunts]

1565
01:44:39,338 --> 01:44:40,338
[crashes]

1566
01:44:40,921 --> 01:44:43,171
[exhales] Fuck me.

1567
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:44,511
That'll work.

1568
01:44:45,255 --> 01:44:46,835
Snow will be coming in soon.

1569
01:44:48,671 --> 01:44:50,261
Nobody'll ever see it again.

1570
01:44:51,838 --> 01:44:52,758
Good.

1571
01:44:56,838 --> 01:44:58,128
All right, let's keep going.

1572
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:30,010
[Santiago, softly]
Let's put him down for a second.

1573
01:45:31,463 --> 01:45:33,383
[all grunt]

1574
01:45:37,505 --> 01:45:38,835
[William] We're running behind.

1575
01:45:38,921 --> 01:45:40,881
Benny, you should go.
The sun's coming up.

1576
01:45:41,838 --> 01:45:43,708
[Santiago]
We'll meet you down at the cove in 30.

1577
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,300
-[Benny] All right. Be careful.
-[William] Always.

1578
01:45:51,463 --> 01:45:52,383
[Frankie grunts]

1579
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:55,460
[William grunts]

1580
01:45:58,671 --> 01:46:00,011
[indistinct chatter]

1581
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,090
[dogs barking]

1582

[indistinct radio chatter]

1585
01:46:42,713 --> 01:46:44,423
[Benny, in Spanish]
Thank you for waiting.

1586
01:46:46,005 --> 01:46:47,585
[captain] The boat is ready.

1587
01:46:49,546 --> 01:46:50,916
[William sighs]

1588
01:46:53,505 --> 01:46:54,955
[William, in English] No, wait. Whoa.

1589
01:46:56,546 --> 01:46:57,506
Is there anyone?

1590
01:46:59,338 --> 01:47:01,338
-It looks abandoned.
-Cover me.

1591
01:47:05,046 --> 01:47:06,546
[fighter] Stop! [in Spanish] Hands up!

1592
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:09,590
-[in English] Stop!
-Put your hands up!

1593
01:47:09,671 --> 01:47:11,131
[Santiago, in Spanish] Wait! Wait!

1594
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,210
[panting]

1595
01:47:14,296 --> 01:47:15,166
Listen!

1596
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:19,510
Little brother, be careful with that gun.
Don't point it at me.

1597
01:47:19,588 --> 01:47:23,128
[in English] I speak English! [grunts]
What's in the bag? What is that?

1598
01:47:23,213 --> 01:47:24,173
[William] It's our friend.

1599
01:47:24,921 --> 01:47:27,551
-He's dead.
-I call boss.

1600
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:29,590
-[in Spanish] No, don't do that.
-[in English] Stop!

1601
01:47:31,005 --> 01:47:33,335
[Santiago, in Spanish]
We don't have any problem with you.

1602
01:47:34,005 --> 01:47:35,005
[in English] Right, guys?

1603
01:47:35,088 --> 01:47:36,418
-We don't have a problem with him.
-No problem.

1604
01:47:36,505 --> 01:47:39,295
-I'm taking a shot.
-No! No. Don't do that.

1605
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:40,880
[in Spanish] It's okay.

1606
01:47:40,963 --> 01:47:42,213
[inhales sharply] Uh-uh.

1607
01:47:44,546 --> 01:47:46,206
[Santiago] Hey, calm down.

1608
01:47:46,671 --> 01:47:48,921
[fighter] This is 16! I need help!
[grunts]

1609

[man speaks Spanish over radio]

1610
01:47:51,588 --> 01:47:52,588
Dumbass!

1611
01:47:52,671 --> 01:47:53,961
-[Santiago] Where are the keys?
-I don't know.

1612
01:47:54,046 --> 01:47:56,876
They just left me here with just the car
and the radio. [sniffles]

1613
01:47:57,088 --> 01:47:58,048
[in English] Fuck!

1614
01:47:58,421 --> 01:47:59,551
-[Santiago, in Spanish] Are you sure?
-Yes.

1615
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:00,460
[Santiago] Are you lying?

1616
01:48:00,546 --> 01:48:02,706
[in English]
Hey, hey, kid, just relax, all right?

1617
01:48:02,796 --> 01:48:05,836
[man over radio, in Spanish]
<i>Sixteen? Sixteen, is that you?</i>

1618
01:48:05,921 --> 01:48:07,881
<i>We're going to send someone.</i>

1619
01:48:08,921 --> 01:48:10,421
[engine starts and revs]

1620
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,760
[in English] Yes! Fuck yes!

1621
01:48:12,838 --> 01:48:14,168
Let's move. Let's get it outta here.

1622
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:17,301
-[Santiago] Grab his radio.
-[William] Got it.

1623
01:48:22,255 --> 01:48:23,665
[Santiago, in Spanish]
Here's a little advice:

1624
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:25,761
[Frankie grunts]

1625
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:26,960
Get away from these men.

1626
01:48:27,046 --> 01:48:28,126
[Frankie, in English] Let's move!

1627
01:48:28,213 --> 01:48:29,963
[in Spanish] Go home. Get out of here.

1628
01:48:30,046 --> 01:48:31,626
[Frankie] <i>Vamos,</i> Pope!

1629
01:48:34,213 --> 01:48:35,133
[Santiago sighs]

1630
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,380
[in English]
Did you give that fucking kid money?

1631
01:48:39,463 --> 01:48:41,883
We should have killed that kid
as soon as he saw our faces.

1632
01:48:41,963 --> 01:48:43,713
We are not killing any more people.

1633
01:48:44,171 --> 01:48:47,051
I'll tell you right now, if we get
to that beach and Ben isn't there,

1634
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,420
I'm fucking killing people.

1635
01:48:48,505 --> 01:48:50,755
-All right, he'll be there. Fuck!
-[car approaching]

1636

Shit.

1638
01:48:56,505 --> 01:48:57,545

What the hell is this?

1644
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:11,710
Shit!

1645
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:13,666
[teen on radio in Spanish] <i>They crashed</i>
<i>into us! Look out, be careful!</i>

1646
01:49:13,755 --> 01:49:16,875
<i>-They're heading to the beach.</i>
-[man on radio] <i>They just passed.</i>

1647
01:49:16,963 --> 01:49:19,173

1648
01:49:19,255 --> 01:49:21,705
-[Frankie] More are coming.
-There's two vehicles!

1649
01:49:21,796 --> 01:49:24,206
All right, it should open up
onto the beach any minute.

1650
01:49:24,296 --> 01:49:25,456
Pope, shoot!

1651
01:49:25,546 --> 01:49:26,376
Fuck!

1652
01:49:26,463 --> 01:49:29,883

[William] Goddamn!

1664
01:50:27,755 --> 01:50:29,165
All right, here's the beach.

1665
01:50:35,588 --> 01:50:37,168
Where is he? Do you see him?

1666
01:50:37,963 --> 01:50:41,923
No, but the cove where we're supposed
to meet him's about a mile up this beach.

Just kill them!

Go!

It looks like this is the end of the road.

1676

[Frankie] I see it.

We gotta cross over the dune!
Cross over the dune!

1678

Let's go!

cut five ways.

1688
01:53:18,588 --> 01:53:23,628
Which gives you five shares of $1,066,824.

1689
01:53:24,296 --> 01:53:27,756
Oh, and I need all of your signatures
on the fifth contract here.

1690
01:53:28,296 --> 01:53:32,206
It'll deposit the deceased's share

Here you are.

1692

1698
01:54:54,588 --> 01:54:57,758
[woman] So, I will schedule
all the payments to the family trust.

1699
01:55:00,213 --> 01:55:01,133
Of course.

1700
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,010
-Thank you. That's for you.
-Thank you. I'll be in touch.

1701
01:55:20,713 --> 01:55:22,713
[indistinct chatter]

1702
01:55:30,796 --> 01:55:33,126
[sighs]
So, what are you guys gonna do now?

1703
01:55:35,421 --> 01:55:36,801
I gotta get home. [chuckles]

1704
01:55:38,171 --> 01:55:39,381
Not without these.

1705
01:55:44,963 --> 01:55:46,673
That'll help. [chuckles]

1706
01:55:58,005 --> 01:55:59,085
[in Spanish] See you.

1707
01:56:03,005 --> 01:56:04,205
Take care of yourself.

1708
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:12,210
[in English] See you, buddy.

1709
01:56:14,338 --> 01:56:15,378
Love you, man.

1710
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:17,090
[clicks tongue] I love you, too.

1711
01:56:21,421 --> 01:56:23,421
-I'll see you in a bit, all right?
-[Benny] See you.

1712
01:56:32,046 --> 01:56:33,416
So, what you gonna do now?

1713
01:56:36,421 --> 01:56:38,461
[sighs] I don't know.

1714
01:56:39,963 --> 01:56:41,013
Maybe I'll, uh...

1715
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:44,010
I'll go see this girl I know in Australia.

1716
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:49,340
Yeah, you should.
I hear she recently came into some money.

1717
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:53,130
I guess she made out
a whole hell of a lot better

1718
01:56:53,213 --> 01:56:54,263
than any of us did.

1719
01:56:55,421 --> 01:56:56,841
That seems about right.

1720
01:57:00,588 --> 01:57:02,628
When you see Molly and the girls...

1721
01:57:06,505 --> 01:57:08,705
remind them who he was.

1722
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:10,300
Yeah, I will.

1723
01:57:18,588 --> 01:57:20,168
Take care of yourself, all right?

1724
01:57:20,921 --> 01:57:21,761
You, too.

1725
01:57:24,421 --> 01:57:27,091
[William] Maybe we can go
do something good with it one day.
