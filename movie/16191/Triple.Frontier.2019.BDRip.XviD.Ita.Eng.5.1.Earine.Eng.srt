-They took him?
-I don't know.

185
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,213
They took my brother,
and you have to get him out.

186
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,088
-Get him out?
-Yes.

187
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,963
You're lucky he's still alive.

188
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:41,963
But he won't be alive for very long.

189
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,671
[Santiago] You never should've let
your idiot brother get involved

190
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:45,588
with this shit.

191
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:47,213
[sighs]

192
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,296
[in English] What if I told you I know?

193
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,088
I know where Lorea is.

194
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,671
I know where the money is.

195
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:07,046
How long have you known?

196
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,338
Three months.

197
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:12,963
And why wouldn't you tell me that?

198
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,630
Because I'm just your informant, right?

199
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,546
That's all I am?

200
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,755
If you've got something to tell me,
right now is the time to do it.

201
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:25,921
[informant] I...

202
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:29,255
was given a promotion.

203
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,796
I deliver vans full of money...

204
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:34,921
to Lorea's house in the jungle.

205
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:36,880
That's where he keeps the money.

206
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,838
[in Spanish] His house is a safe.

207
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:41,671
[in English] And just so you know,

208
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:46,046
Lorea pays Diego and all of those men
that hired you way too much money.

209
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,046
They've just been watching you
chase your tail.

210
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,171
But now, maybe,
you can actually do something.

211
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,296
[somber march playing]

212
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,380
Your government has put a lot of time,
money, and training into all of you,

213
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:23,921
and it does not want to lose
that investment.

214
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:26,380
Over the next few weeks,

215
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:30,838
you will be bombarded with offers
to take your skill set and use them

216
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,546
in the private sector.

217
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,505
I was suckered into the same thing.

218
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:39,255
That's what I'm here to say,

219
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,255
that I have never had a feeling
as pure or proud

220
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:48,171
as completing a mission
with our flag on my shoulder.

221
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,171
Stay where you belong.

222
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:53,005
Thank you.

223
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,421
[man speaks indistinctly]

224
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:01,713
-[door opens]
-[William] Good luck.

225
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:06,213
-[both chuckle]
-[William grunts]

226
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,005
How many times have you given that speech?

227
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,713
It'll be 173.

228
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,296
[Santiago laughs] Still keeping count
of everything in your life?

229
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,213
Of course.

230
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,046
-[Santiago] It's still a good speech.
-Thank you.

231
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:17,588
How you been?

232
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,713
I'm okay. You?

233
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,255
Did you get my text?

234
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:24,421
Yeah.

235
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:29,755
[Santiago] So? What's your take?

236
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:32,296
Who else do you have?

237
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:33,588
I came to you first.

238
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,338
If you can get Redfly,

239
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,963
I'll do it.

240
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:45,880
Really?

241
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:48,296
Yeah.

242
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:50,796
[Santiago]
Do you think he's up for it?

243
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:55,296
I just feel like we owe him.
Besides...

244
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:58,671
it's always a little harder
than you think it's gonna be, right?

245
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,755
Get the captain, I'm in.

246
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:10,838
So... this is three bedroom...
and one and a half baths.

247
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,421
Nice view out the back window here.

248
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:21,963
Gets good light.

249
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,213
Kitchen's right this way.

250
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:27,838
They're asking $120,000.

251
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:32,088
-I think there's some flexibility there.
-Yeah.

252
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:35,088
I don't think this is the one for us.
Thank you, though.

253
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,296
All right, thank you.

254
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,171
[door opens]

255
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,838
[door closes]

256
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:56,213
[man sighs]

257
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,671
[Santiago] Hey, I'm lookin' for a condo.

258
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,838
I hear you're the guy to talk to.

259
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,671
-Sorry to track you down like this.
-Hey, man.

260
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:07,796
I called your office.

261
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,171
-[Redfly] It's good to see you.
-[Santiago] Good to see you.

262
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:11,755
-You look great.
-Ah, yeah, right.

263
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,796
-No, you do.
-It's been a while, huh?

264
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Well, we didn't hear from you
for a couple of years.

265
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:18,046
We thought you might have gone full native
in the jungle.

266
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,463
[Santiago] Yeah, I know.

267
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:20,921
Sorry.

268
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:24,088
-So, how are you?
-[Redfly sighs]

269
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,755
Uh... I'm okay.

270
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,755
[Santiago] Yeah,
I heard about you and Molly.

271
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:31,338
Yeah. It happens.

272
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:34,505
So, I got a job for you.

273
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,963
Guaranteed 17 grand
for a week of consulting.

274
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:42,046
No action unless you want it.
It's just a recce.

275
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,963
I'm retired.

276
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,130
I know. [chuckles]

277
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:46,505
What is it?

278
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,046
We're gonna get Gabriel Martin Lorea.

279
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,880
[Redfly] Haven't you been trying
to do that for years?

280
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:53,755
Yes.
I could never find him, and I finally did.

281
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:55,838
I can't do it, man.

282
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,796
There's more of this shit
around now than ever.

283
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,921
Anthony was down here trying
to get me to go to Africa for a month,

284
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,255
-but I-- I can't-- I can't do it.
-[Santiago] I need you on this one.

285
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,796
-It's less than a week of work.
-I would love to.

286
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,838
God knows I could use the money,

287
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:09,046
but I'm supporting
two households right now.

288
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,005
There's potential
for significant upside on this.

289
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,213
Will you just take a look
at my work on it?

290
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:15,838
[sighs, clicks tongue]

291
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,088
-Are you going to Benny's fight?
-[Santiago] Yeah.

292
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,463
I gotta pick up Tess. I'm late.
Molly's gonna kill me.

293
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,380
-Just ride with me, okay?
-[Santiago] All right.

294
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:29,880
[Santiago] Molly's still letting you
over here, even after the split?

295
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,338
Only in the garage.

296
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,380
[Santiago] I'm sorry.

297
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:38,046
[sighs] Tess!

298
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,671
-Still drink?
-[Santiago] Oh, yeah.

299
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,588
Want a beer?

300
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:48,796
[Tom] Ah, shit.

301
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,963
[sighs] You sleeping with this woman?

302
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,755
The accountant, the bean counter
who gave you all the information.

303
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:11,755
I'm guessing she's hot.

304
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,421
-[can opens]
-What's that supposed to mean?

305
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:15,130
Oh, well, I just noticed, over the years,

306
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,463
your informants tend to be
very attractive women.

307
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:19,088
[Tom chuckles]

308
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:21,255
No, I'm not.

309
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:24,171
[clicks tongue, sighs] Why not?

310
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,713
[Santiago] It's a fucked-up enough
situation as it is.

311
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,796
[Tom] Hey, babe.

312
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,213
[Santiago] Hey, Tess!

313
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,005
[sighs] Santiago.

314
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,130
Wow, so grown up, man.

315
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,463
-[Tom] Oh, I don't know about that.
-[Santiago chuckles]

316
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:45,963
I made 17 grand my first year
in the service, man.

317
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:49,213
If you told me then I'd be passing that up
for a week's work...

318
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:54,296
Don't worry about her, she's 15.
She's not listening to a word we say.

319
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:57,213
[Santiago]
Seventeen grand is just for the recce.

320
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:01,296
But if we decide to move forward,
this could be a whole lot more than that.

321
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,671
I've cut a deal
with the agency down there.

322
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,755
We keep 25% of anything we seize.

323
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,463
I've got estimates he's got
over $75 million in cash with him.

324
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,838
-[Tom] Holy shit.
-Yeah.

325
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,671
Let's say the money is there.
How do we get paid?

326
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:20,255
'Cause this shit is serious,
and it takes real planning.

327
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:21,380
And you know that.

328
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:22,880
[Santiago] I've got a lawyer in St. John's

329
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:25,880
who set up
an offshore shell security operation

330
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:29,296
that's ready to pay out a salary
and bonuses for the rest of our lives.

331
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,130
It'll just come in
like any other paycheck.

332
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:33,338
Will you take a look at my work on it?

333
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,546
No, I don't want to see that
because then I can't unsee it.

334
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,713
This operation is... illegal, right?

335
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:41,671
This is not illegal.

336
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:45,088
My company's under contract
to an agency of a foreign government.

337
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:48,796
And besides, even if it was illegal,
most of the live fire you've done's been

338
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,713
against the Geneva Convention,
technically, so...

339
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,880
[Tom] Come on,
you're a better salesman than that.

340
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:55,546
This is a very different thing.

341
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,463
I'll be right back.

342
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:03,588
[door chimes jingle]

343
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,588
[Tess] So you're trying to get him
to go back to work?

344
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:08,921
[door chimes jingle]

345
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:12,005
Maybe. Why?

346
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:15,755
No reason.

347
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:19,505
You think your mom would still let him go?

348
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:22,171
[Tess] My mom? [chuckles] Of course.

349
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:26,005
-She's not the problem. [sighs]
-[door chimes jingle]

350
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,546
[Tess] He hasn't worked
since they forced him to retire.

351
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,088
[Fleetwood Mac's "The Chain" playing]

352
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:32,338
Your dad's a good man.

353
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,463

and that's our window.

525
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,546
Why would he do that?

526
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,755
[Santiago] Worried
about someone taking his kids.

527
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:55,921
And he never leaves his money.

528
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,713
Also, I don't think he believes
anyone actually has the balls

529
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:00,088
to come out here and rob him.

530
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:02,588
It's probably 'cause it's a stupid idea.

531
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:08,588
[Benny] Pope,
I got your girlfriend coming up right now.

532
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:11,046
Holy shit.

533
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,755
She is beautiful, man.

534
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,171
I fucking knew it.

535
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,755
Fuck off.

536
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:28,713
[William whispers] God damn.

537
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:36,046
I got an execution
about to go down over here.

538
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,588
Are you at the tennis courts?

539
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:38,505
[William] Yeah.

540
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:39,796
Yeah, that's his spot.

541
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:42,755
[Lorea] Perdóname, padre.

542
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:43,838
[flies buzzing]

543
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,005
[gun fires]

544
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:49,171
-[gun continues firing]
-[sighs]

545
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:53,255
[gun cocks]

546
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,130
[Frankie] Why is she doing this?

547
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:01,713
[Santiago] She hopes I can get
her little brother out of jail.

548
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,213
[Benny] Did you put him in jail?

549
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:06,963
-[Santiago] Not really.
-Buenas.

550
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:10,380
[Tom] I'm guessing that's putting her
at some risk.

551
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:13,380
[Frankie] Man, I almost forgot
why I got out of this business.

552
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,380
Shit gets so dark so quick.

553
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:20,963
Oh, shit,
we got ground sensors here, boys.

554
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:23,088
[Santiago] Did you hit one?

555
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,505
I don't know, I'm not sure.

556
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:32,296
[man speaking Spanish]

557
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:41,255
Benny, I got two guys
on motorbikes coming your way.

558
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:44,671
[William] Hold tight, Benny.
I'm trying to get out there to cover you.

559
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,255
[informant, in Spanish]
Good afternoon, Mr. Lorea.

560
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:58,421
[motorbikes approaching]

561
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,838
[in English] A stock boy job
at Walmart's starting

562
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,671
to look pretty good right now, boys.

563
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,130
[in Spanish] It looks good to me.

564
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:12,213
Good.

565
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,130
-[bookkeeper] Okay.
-[slams]

566
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,130
Thank you, sir.

567
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:25,505
[indistinct chatter]

568
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,921
[in English]
I'm clear. They're coming back to you.

569
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:34,338
[sighs] Let's get the fuck outta here.

570
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:39,171
[all laugh]

571
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:41,130
[Frankie] You were gonna piss yourself.

572
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:43,338
I was getting onto the déjà vu part, man.

573
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,005
-[all laugh]
-[dance music playing over radio]

574
00:33:46,755 --> 00:33:48,088
[William] So what's the plan?

575
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,796
Are their guys prepared to operate
across the border?

576
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:52,671
What's the scope of this thing?

577
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:54,713
Sunday soft hit is the way to do it.

578
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:57,380
Otherwise, you bring in an army,
you'd start a fucking war up there.

579
00:33:57,463 --> 00:34:01,130
Mm-hmm. So, when do you need
to present to the agency down here?

580
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:03,796
[exhales]

581
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:06,505
[clicks tongue]
I'm not sure I wanna tell them.

582
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:07,880
Why?

583
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,963
[Santiago] We saw the place.

584
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:11,546
It's full of holes.

585
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:14,213
So maybe we don't tell them...

586
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,546
-[Benny chuckles]
-...and we do this thing ourselves.

587
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,505
What?

588
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:22,463
-[Santiago] What?
-[Benny sighs]

589
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:24,546
Now, we each took 17 grand...

590
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,921
to help the narcotics unit map out
and plan this fuckin' thing.

591
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:31,338
I told you I wasn't even comfortable
helping them do it.

592
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,463
Now you want us to do it by ourselves?
Kill a bunch of fuckin' narcos?

593
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:37,588
If we hit that window, like you said,
when they're at church,

594
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:40,338
nobody but Lorea gets killed.

595
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,380
[Santiago] And I'm okay with that.

596
00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:46,088
[Tom] Does the agency down here
even know about this?

597
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,005
-What do you mean?
-Come on, man!

598
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:49,171
Don't fuck around.

599
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,046
Who paid our fees?

600
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,755
It's complicated, technically...

601
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,338
you guys were paid through an LLC.

602
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:59,046
Mm, no, not that complicated.

603
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,171
It's $100,000.
Where the fuck did it come from?

604
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:02,213
[men laughing]

605
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:05,505
[speaking Portuguese]

606
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:09,546
[Santiago] I'll get the bill.

607
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:11,171
Thanks.

608
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:13,880
Great trip, boys. [sighs]

609
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:16,671
It's turning out
to be some full-on cowboy shit.

610
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,588
[Tom clears throat]

611
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:27,005
Whose money is it, huh?

612
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,838
-It was my money.
-Jeez.

613
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:31,380
[Frankie, in Spanish]
What were you thinking?

614
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,338
[in English] What?
Does that change anything?

615
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:34,838
Yeah, man.

616
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:37,255
You fucking lied to us.

617
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:39,213
No, I didn't lie to you.

618
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:41,005
[softly]
I asked you guys to come down here,

619
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,171
do reconnaissance, and make a plan.

620
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,671
Now, we can execute that plan alone

621
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:48,338
and take all of the money,

622
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:52,588
or you guys can fuck off,
and I'll bring the team from down here in.

623
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:57,213
But I assure you, if I do that,
this fucker will find out about it,

624
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,713
and he'll be gone, and I need this guy.

625
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:02,505
You know how many fucking bad men
are out there all over the world?

626
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,546
Yeah, well, this is my last one.

627
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,171
-[both chuckle]
-[Santiago] And you may not believe it,

628
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,671
but I have been here
for the last three years of my life,

629
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:12,963
trying to make a difference,
but it's a fucking mess.

630
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,546
And it's all because of Lorea.

631
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:19,380
The thought of leaving everything
we've done behind for the last 17 years,

632
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:20,921
with nothing to show for it--

633
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:22,838
-Fuck you, nothing to show for it.
-[scoffs]

634
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:24,630
Look, if...

635
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:26,921
If we had accomplished half the things
that we've accomplished

636
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:29,213
in any other profession,
we'd be set for life.

637
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,713
Hey, man, that's the deal we cut.

638
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:33,963
-Well, it's a shitty deal.
-Yeah, well...

639
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,088
Because this man's a goddamn hero,

640
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,255
and he can't even send his kids
to college.

641
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,880
And Fish's the most talented pilot I know,
and he's grounded on a bullshit coke rap.

642
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:45,713
And how many times can your brother
get the shit knocked out of him for--

643
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:47,880
I didn't get the shit beat out of me.
I won that fight.

644
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:48,796
Sorry, Benny.

645
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,796
And how many more pep talks
can you possibly give?

646
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:54,130
I'm done, man.

647
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,838
Both knees are shot.

648
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:58,588
That neck operation I got last year
made the whole thing worse.

649
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:01,255
So, the question is,

650
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:04,130
do we finally get to use our skills
for our own benefit

651
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:06,171
and actually change something?

652
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:15,421
[engine revs]

653
00:37:19,463 --> 00:37:20,630
So, are we doing this?

654
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:22,713
[Tom]
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

655
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,630
This guy doesn't come through
with the one key piece of intel

656
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,005
we need to make this decision.

657
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:27,921
For all we know,

658
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:29,838
she could be setting us up
to get her brother back.

659
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:31,171
We'll know tomorrow.

660
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:34,296
She should have been recording
that whole thing today.

661
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:37,880
All right, if it does come back clean,

662
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,921
how would you do
the Sunday morning version?

663
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:45,546
-I haven't thought about it.
-Bullshit, you can't help yourself.

664
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:48,963
All right.

665
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,630
In the first pop, you'd have 40 minutes
to get in, get the job done,

666
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,755
and get out before the family
comes home from church.

667
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:54,713
That's a hard out.

668
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:56,463
We need to breach the fence,

669
00:37:56,546 --> 00:37:59,088
sweep the premises,
find and subdue the guards,

670
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:01,713
scrub the hard drives
in the security room,

671
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:06,213
get rid of Lorea, find the money,
pack the money into 18 hundred-pound bags,

672
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:08,755
and then hoof it half a mile
to the nearest vehicle.

673
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,255
There's only two ways out:

674
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:12,671
the fence in the front,
or over the mountain we came down,

675
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:13,880
and I'm too old for that.

676
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,546
We need to use one of their vans.

677
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,380
[Frankie]
There were two vans in the courtyard.

678
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,421
But if the family uses those vans
to go to church, then we got nothing.

679
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:23,796
So we need another van.

680
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:27,380
-Can your girl work that out?
-I can ask her.

681
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:31,880
Still got your aviation guy down here?

682
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:35,421
'Cause we would need
a heavy-lift helicopter in 32 hours

683
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:37,671
to get us over the Andes and to the ocean.

684
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:39,921
I don't know, but I'll give him a call.

685
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:44,005
[Benny] Oh, yeah! Big dog is back!

686
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:46,546
Redfly's gonna be rich, boys!

687
00:38:47,421 --> 00:38:48,630
[laughs]

688
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:50,005
Now we're talkin'.

689
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:57,296
-[upbeat music playing over radio]
-[indistinct chatter]

690
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,421
[in Spanish] Hello.

691
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:09,713
Hola.

692
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:12,296
¿Señor?

693
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:15,463
-Thank you. Have a good day.
-[vendor speaking Spanish]

694
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:20,463
[Lorea speaking Spanish on recording]

695
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:30,755
-[Santiago, in English] Thank you.
-That's it?

696
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:33,796
[Santiago] I don't know.

697
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,671
[in Spanish] Miss, two coffees, please.

698
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:37,421
-[in English] My brother.
-[Santiago] Yeah.

699
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:40,463
I might need you to do one more thing
for me.

700
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,463
Can you get an extra van...

701
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:45,921
into the compound, Sunday morning?

702
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:49,005
If I did that,
they're going to know it's me.

703
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:52,755
And everyone who works for him
ends up dead, sooner or later.

704
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,005
If you can get me an extra van
in there Sunday morning...

705
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:01,088
I will get you and your brother
out of the country

706
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,880
with new papers and money.

707
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,255
How much?

708
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,046
[chuckles softly]

709
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:10,171
Two million.

710
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,255
Two million?

711
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:13,505
[Santiago] Yes.

712
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,671
And you'll only have a couple hours
to get my brother?

713
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:17,505
I'll find a way.

714
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:22,338
But I need that van inside those gates.

715
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:30,005
[sighs] Okay.

716
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,796
-Yeah?
-[informant] Yes. I'll get the van.

717
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,380
But if we're not gone forever
after you make your move, we are dead.

718
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:39,546
You'll be gone.

719
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:43,505
Yeah.

720
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:47,713
Thank you.

721
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:08,838
[Santiago] Hey, fellas.

722
00:41:11,796 --> 00:41:12,921
Take a look at this.

723
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,713
[chuckles] Jesus, Pope!

724
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:20,755
-What the hell were you planning here?
-Exactly this.

725
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:22,963
Every single gun, bullet,

726
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,255
and fucking toothpick here's been sourced
in-country.

727
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,921
The idea is to pin this
on a local rival gang.

728
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:33,088
Now, who was it
that didn't trust this lady?

729
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:37,880
'Cause not only is she going to get us
that extra van, but she got us this.

730
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:42,921
There's our man, Lorea.

731
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,755
And, oh!

732
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:46,963
Look at what's there behind him.

733
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,213
-[Lorea speaking on recording]
-Looks like money to me.

734
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:52,088
-There's gotta be about 35 million there.
-We don't know that.

735
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:53,380
Whatever it is, it's a lot.

736
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:55,713
What are you gonna do
with your share, huh?

737
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:58,380
Never spend your money
until it's in your pocket, Benjamin.

738
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:00,921
[Benny] Well, I'm just sayin',
I'm gonna get that Ferrari, man.

739
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:03,255
-[Frankie] How original.
-What about the bird?

740
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,005
Well, he said if we're there
with three million bucks, he'll be there.

741
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,713
So we got a bird, we got a van,

742
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:13,963
we got Lorea confirmed
in the house with the money.

743
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:20,463
All right, give me-- give me a minute.

744
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:23,130
[sighs]

745
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,713
[Frankie exhales]

746
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:37,630
Uh, you know, if you had pulled this shit
when we were active duty,

747
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:39,213
I would have court-martialed your ass.

748
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:42,671
Look, why don't we all
just have a dinner tonight,

749
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:45,296
get drunk, on me,
and you all can go home in the morning?

750
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:47,963
Nah, fuck that.

751
00:42:48,796 --> 00:42:50,421
[sighs] I can't.

752
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:52,046
Somehow, I just...

753
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:54,130
[sighs]

754
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:56,755
...ended up against it here. You know?

755
00:42:57,505 --> 00:43:00,130
I'm burning through my pension.
Molly's job doesn't cut it.

756
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,296
I can't sell condos
to save my fucking life.

757
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,046
The only thing I have
is taking care of these girls.

758
00:43:06,505 --> 00:43:07,380
[Santiago] Yeah.

759
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,380
Yeah, I understand that.

760
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,296
Fuck, I missed this.

761
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:18,421
It's like they take your best 20 years,
and then spit you out.

762
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,130
Yeah.

763
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:22,421
[Tom] I just can't stop thinking
about the mistakes.

764
00:43:24,088 --> 00:43:26,880
-[Santiago] What mistakes?
-[sighs] Fuck, man.

765
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:29,088
All of 'em.

766
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:33,130
-Didn't get better when you got out?
-[Tom] No.

767
00:43:34,213 --> 00:43:37,130
Only thing that made it feel better
is when you put a gun in my hand.

768
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:40,630
[clicks tongue]
So, I guess that's what we'll do.

769
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:42,421
[sighs]

770
00:43:45,671 --> 00:43:46,630
[Santiago sighs]

771
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,255
[Tom] All right, first things first:

772
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:55,171
safety.

773
00:43:56,005 --> 00:43:58,213
There is no medevac.
There is no ground support.

774
00:43:58,296 --> 00:44:00,755
Any injuries we sustain,
we're walking out with.

775
00:44:01,046 --> 00:44:03,630
Be mindful,
each of you has a medical kit in your bag.

776
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:05,380
Number two:

777
00:44:05,463 --> 00:44:07,921
you cannot go back
to your normal life after tonight.

778
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:12,046
Make no mistake about it.
What we are about to do is criminal.

779
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:16,005
We do not have the flag on our shoulders,
and no amount of bullshit

780
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,755
that we tell ourselves
is gonna change that.

781
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:19,796
If we do our job right,

782
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,713
we will be committing one murder
and one armed robbery.

783
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,171
You guys need to own the fact
that you are desecrating

784
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:26,963
most of the oaths you ever took.

785
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:29,963
-[Frankie sighs]
-[Tom] Third:

786
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,255
family.

787
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,005
If they don't go to church,
or if they come home early,

788
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,755
it's an abort. Full stop.
They are not who we came for.

789
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,588
And lastly,

790
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:40,546
it's not too late to go home.

791
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:42,421
We had an agreement with Pope,

792
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,088
and we fulfilled that.

793
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:47,630
Any man here who wants to walk away now
can do so knowing they're the best of us.

794
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,088
But it's gotta be now.

795
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:56,796
I wanna make sure
we're not leaving that house

796
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,380
without taking care of Lorea.

797
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,546
If he's there like he's supposed to be,
we'll get him.

798
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,880
We leave at 0300.

799
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:06,838
[Benny] Hooah.

800
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:09,588
[rain pouring]

801
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,380
[Benny over radio] It's a good thing
these guys are so devout.

802
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:18,505
Our dad used to say,

803
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:21,088
"When it's raining, it means
God didn't need us in church today."

804
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:25,380
He also said you go to heaven
for the climate and hell for the company.

805
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
[Benny]
Actually, I think Mark Twain said that.

806
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:30,338
All right, keep the radio clear,
let's stay awake here.

807
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,088
[Tom]
How many is that getting in? Count it.

808
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:36,380
Seven getting in the van.

809
00:45:37,255 --> 00:45:38,630
[Santiago] Anybody see Lorea?

810
00:45:39,255 --> 00:45:41,213
Negative. We never saw him come out.

811
00:45:41,796 --> 00:45:44,796
The wife and two kids are in
with a single driver.

812
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:47,296
The family's left the building.

813
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:50,588
Repeat, family are all clear.

814
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:54,463
All right, let's get ready here.

815
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:00,921
Damn, Pope, this lady is a keeper.

816
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:03,255
Punctual, smart, and brave as shit.

817
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:12,713
-[in Spanish] Good day.
-What's this?

818
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:16,338
I'm here to drop off this van,
and then my brother is taking me home.

819
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:18,796
That idiot didn't tell me.

820
00:46:28,588 --> 00:46:30,213
[Benny, in English] She's in. She's in.

821
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:31,463
[Tom] Here we go.

822
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:33,505
Ben, you're first hit.
Call when it's secure.

823
00:46:33,755 --> 00:46:36,171
With this rain,
the guards are gonna be inside.

824
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:37,671
[Benny] Roger.

825
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,796
-[Benny] All clear, she's gone.
-[Tom] Copy.

826
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,921
[William] All right, we're going in.

827
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:25,880
[soccer commentators speaking Spanish
on television]

828
00:47:38,963 --> 00:47:40,963
[commentary continues]

829
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:49,755
[commentary continues]

830
00:48:19,671 --> 00:48:21,046
[guard grunting]

831
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:32,755
[William grunts]

832
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:43,838
[Benny] Front gate secure.

833
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,505
One guard secured in the kitchen.

834
00:48:46,963 --> 00:48:49,546
-[Tom] Ben, come to the house.
-[Benny] Roger.

835
00:49:01,713 --> 00:49:03,296
[Benny] I'm at the front door.

836
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,505
Hold, Benny. Hold.

837
00:49:05,588 --> 00:49:07,130
Threat in the TV room.

838
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:09,213
We're gonna go around the side.

839
00:49:12,463 --> 00:49:13,505
[man groaning]

840
00:49:16,296 --> 00:49:17,755
[Benny] What's going on in there?

841
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:20,005
[Santiago] All clear, Benny.
Eyes out for Lorea.

842
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:21,588
He sure as fuck heard us now.

843
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:22,546
[Benny] I'm coming in.

844
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,755
[Santiago]
Setting charges to the security room.

845
00:49:29,296 --> 00:49:31,713
[muffled groaning]

846
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:33,213
[Tom] What was that?

847
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:34,671
[Benny] We had to shoot the second guard
in the leg.

848
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:37,630
-They're taking him to the kitchen.
-[Tom] Coming down.

849
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:38,588
[Benny] Come on.

850
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:03,755
[Santiago] Fuse is burning.

851
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,171
[explodes]

852
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:35,046
[Santiago] Any trace of him?

853
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:38,380
She said he never leaves.

854
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,963
[quietly]
We got nothing. This guy's a ghost.

855
00:50:44,046 --> 00:50:46,046
[commentary on TV continues]

856
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,630
[Tom] Everyone to the office, right now.

857
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:15,921
[Benny, shouting] What the fuck?

858
00:51:19,255 --> 00:51:20,088
And Lorea?

859
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:22,505
Nothing. A couple of bags.

860
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,546
-[bags thud]
-[William] He's gone.

861
00:51:26,546 --> 00:51:27,588
With the money.

862
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,880
[Frankie sighs]
Your girl gave us up, Pope.

863
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,213
We gotta get the fuck outta here.

864
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,713
No, no, no, no, no, no.

865
00:51:43,255 --> 00:51:44,213
[sniffs]

866
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:50,588
What's that smell like to you?

867
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:53,921
-Like a serious fuck-up.
-[chuckles]

868
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:56,505
No.

869
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,171
Paint.

870
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:00,380
[sighs]

871
00:52:06,338 --> 00:52:07,463
The house is the safe.

872
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,588
The house is the fucking safe.

873
00:52:40,463 --> 00:52:42,005
[William] Benny, help me move this.
Come on.

874
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,755
-[Benny] I'll take the edge.
-[Tom] Over there.

875
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:45,963
Go, come on. Come on, man. Come on!

876
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,088
-[Benny] Holy shit!
-[Frankie] Come on.

877
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:50,755
-[Tom grunts]
-[William] Go. Move, move.

878
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:52,421
[Benny] C'mon.

879
00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:54,380
-[Tom] Oh, my God!
-[Santiago] Fish, I'm up.

880
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:57,130
[Santiago] Come on, guys!

881
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,963
-[laughs]
-[Santiago] Holy shit!

882
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,880
What'd I tell you, boys?

883
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:05,380
-Jesus Christ!
-[Benny continues laughing]

884
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:09,338
[Santiago] Fucking God! Look at it!

885
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:11,630
-It goes all the way up!
-[William] Let's go!

886
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:12,630
[whoops]

887
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,796
We're gonna need some bags.

888
00:53:21,005 --> 00:53:24,463
-[Benny] I'll get another bag!
-[William] Keep it coming.

889
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:28,171
What's wrong?

890
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:31,255
If the money's still here,
it means he's still here.

891
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:32,380
He's gone, man.

892
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:34,171
We got more!

893
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:35,463
[William] Back wall, too.

894
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,921
[Tom] Just concentrate.

895
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,630
Oh, we're just gettin' rich!

896
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,505
[Santiago] How much time we got?

897
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,713
-[panting]
-[Benny and William] Eight minutes.

898
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:45,088
Millers, enough of that over there.

899
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:46,838
We gotta start getting this shit
to the van.

900
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,005
Yeah, we got this.

901
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,380
-Come on, bro.
-[Tom] Keep your eyes open.

902
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:56,755
[Benny] Yeah, bitches! [laughs, whooping]

903
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,796
[Benny] Here, take these.
I'm gonna go get the van.

904
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,005
-Meet me there.
-[William] Yes, sir.

905
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:05,046
[Frankie] Careful.

906
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,296
-[keys jangle]
-Classic.

907
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:25,963
[Frankie grunts]

908
00:54:31,296 --> 00:54:32,546
Jesus Christ.

909
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,421
-[laughing] Help us, man!
-Come on! Come on!

910
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:38,046
Come on. Over there.

911
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:43,755
-[Santiago grunts]
-Holy shit! [laughs]

912
00:54:53,796 --> 00:54:57,505
[both laughing]

913
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,755
[William] We're gonna need more bags.
See if you can find something.

914
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:01,755
On it.

915
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:04,713
I tell you one thing, man,

916
00:55:04,796 --> 00:55:06,505
you can tell your girls
they can stop studying

917
00:55:06,588 --> 00:55:08,838
'cause Daddy's just gonna buy their way
into Harvard!

918
00:55:10,296 --> 00:55:13,088
[laughing] Holy shit,
this is a fuckload of money!

919
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:15,463
Grab some of those and go.

920
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:16,963
How are we on time?

921
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:18,546
We got time for a couple more loads.

922
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,130
-You sure?
-Grab those and bring 'em down.

923
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,463
[Frankie] Guys!

924
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,005
I got another wall over here!

925
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,838
-[sighs] Holy shit!
-Shit!

926
00:55:27,671 --> 00:55:28,546
It's everywhere.

927
00:55:28,713 --> 00:55:30,338
[sighs] Well, fuck me!

928
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,755
It's the whole fucking house.

929
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:38,880
[William] What's up?

930
00:55:38,963 --> 00:55:40,421
The van's full, man!

931
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,796
It's all good. We gotta go.

932
00:55:46,463 --> 00:55:47,671
What the hell are you doing?

933
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:50,088
Stop digging more out.
We got all this to deal with.

934
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:51,255
A couple more loads.

935
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:53,755
[sighs]

936
00:55:55,463 --> 00:55:58,755
You know, in the ten years
I've been working with you, Tom,

937
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:00,921
you have never missed a hard out!

938
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:04,380
I gave us a 15-minute cushion.

939
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,463
It's 12 minutes to the church,
a 40-minute service, 12 minutes back.

940
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:10,921
Add 5 minutes
to load in and out of the van,

941
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,796
and we can subtract 7 to beat them
to the exit route.

942
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,755
We will be fine!

943
00:56:14,463 --> 00:56:17,296
All right?
God damn it, look at all this money!

944
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:19,421
Just a couple more loads!

945
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:22,671
Fuck this!

946
00:56:26,588 --> 00:56:28,130
Time's up. We gotta go.

947
00:56:28,921 --> 00:56:31,130
I want one more sweep for Lorea.

948
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:33,755
All right?

949
00:56:36,421 --> 00:56:37,880
And then we burn it all down.

950
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,755
[Frankie] Okay,

951
00:56:46,463 --> 00:56:48,171
I'll get these last one loaded down there,

952
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,630
and you call out when you're ready
to light it up.

953
00:56:55,213 --> 00:56:57,380
[sighs] Move. Move!

954
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:02,338
[breathing heavily]

955
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:34,046
[William] Come on, we gotta go!

956
00:57:35,463 --> 00:57:36,838
-Lighting it up.
-[lighter clicks]

957
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:40,463
[Lorea shouts in Spanish]

958
00:57:49,755 --> 00:57:51,171
What are we shooting at in here?

959
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,171
Is that Lorea?

960
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:00,130
He's dead.

961
00:58:01,463 --> 00:58:02,296
Good.

962
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,921
[panting] I'm hit.

963
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,380
Shit!

964
00:58:07,963 --> 00:58:09,088
[groans, inhales sharply]

965
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:10,671
-Take it easy.
-[Santiago] Where?

966
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,296
[grunts] Left side.

967
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:14,755
Did it go through?

968
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:16,130
[Tom] Yeah, it went through.

969
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:17,463
-[William] I'll be fine.
-[Tom] It'll be okay.

970
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:19,630
-[William] Get the clot kit.
-[Tom] Straight through.

971
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:20,838
You'll be okay.

972
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:22,171
You'll be all right.

973
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:23,088
Just breathe.

974
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,505
I'm okay.

975
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,838
All right. Let go.

976
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:33,046
-Told you this was a stupid idea.
-Yeah, you sure did.

977
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,921
[William grunting]

978
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,338
Sunday school's over, boys.

979
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,796
They're back.

980
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:41,921
Oh, shit!

981
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:46,838
-The family?
-No, the first shift of guards.

982
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:48,380
-You okay?
-[William] I'm all right.

983
00:58:48,463 --> 00:58:49,588
You gonna be able to move?

984
00:58:49,671 --> 00:58:50,963
-We don't got a stretcher.
-Yeah.

985
00:58:51,255 --> 00:58:53,046
Just help me get my kit back on.

986
00:58:56,588 --> 00:58:58,463
All right, we can each take
a backpack of cash,

987
00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:02,005
we go out through the back
into the jungle, and we're gone.

988
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:04,838
-I'll cover the cost of the operation.
-Fuck that.

989
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:08,338
No. We are bringing Ironhead home safe.

990
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,088
Not dragging him through the jungle.

991
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,421
And we're not leaving them
any of this fucking money.

992
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:15,213
Right, so we burn it all down and go.

993
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:18,130
There's about $100 million
for them waiting in the van out there.

994
00:59:18,213 --> 00:59:19,796
We need to hunt and shoot quickly.

995
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:22,505
Call out your kills.
I don't want any fuckin' surprises.

996
00:59:22,588 --> 00:59:24,796
-Got it?
-All right.

997
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,213
-Let's do this.
-[grunts]

998
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:29,380
[Tom] You two go that way,
we'll come down the front.

999
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:31,046
I'm all right.

1000
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,588
Let's just do it.

1001
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:34,463
All right.

1002
00:59:35,796 --> 00:59:36,630
All right.

1003
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,421
[sighs]

1004
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,171
[Santiago] Let's go.

1005
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:49,588
[Tom over radio] Here we go, fellas.

1006
01:00:01,088 --> 01:00:03,171
[William]
That's two down in the front hall.

1007
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,130
[Frankie] That's three.

1008
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:14,255
[Santiago] That's four.

1009
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:15,671
[Tom] Get back to the gate.

1010
01:00:15,755 --> 01:00:17,838
I'm sure they dropped
a few guys out there.

1011
01:00:17,921 --> 01:00:18,796
On the way.

1012
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:26,755
[man mumbles]

1013
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:35,880
[sighs]

1014
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,630
[glass shatters]

1015
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:54,671
[Frankie] Anybody got eyes
on that SUV the guards came in?

1016
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:56,296
Because we're gonna need it.

1017
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,755
[Benny] I'm already loading it up.

1018
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:01,796
[Tom] Is everybody out of there?

1019
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,671
-[Benny] Coast's clear.
-[Santiago] All clear.

1020
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:15,505
[Benny] Another van of guys
just passed me in the driveway.

1021
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:34,005
[Santiago] Catfish is coming around
with the van.

1022
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:39,171
What are you doing?
Come on! Let's go!

1023
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,713
[engine starts]

1024
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,463
[Frankie] Benny! Hey!

1025
01:02:07,796 --> 01:02:09,380
[Santiago] Let's go, man! Hustle!

1026
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,713
Fuck!

1027
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:15,546
Fuck!

1028
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:24,005
Fuck!

1029
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:26,213
-[Tom] What?
-What do you mean, what?

1030
01:02:26,296 --> 01:02:29,338
That was a shit job back there, man.
We don't leave messes like that!

1031
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:35,296
[Frankie] What do we do up here?
I've got the family waiting to go in.

1032
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:38,046
[Tom] Take it slow.

1033
01:02:56,796 --> 01:02:58,796
[birds calling]

1034
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,338
-[Santiago grunts]
-[Frankie] Your girlfriend's here.

1035
01:03:28,546 --> 01:03:30,338
-[in Spanish] Did you get out okay?
-[informant] Yes.

1036
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:32,588
We're almost there. Help me.

1037
01:03:33,046 --> 01:03:33,880
Vamos.

1038
01:03:34,963 --> 01:03:36,880
[in English]
Just load 'em up, and I'll weigh 'em.

1039
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:39,963
[scale beeps]

1040
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,588
-[Frankie] Where's your guy?
-He'll be here.

1041
01:03:50,088 --> 01:03:52,088
[plane engine roars]

1042
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,130
What the fuck we gonna do with that thing?

1043
01:04:10,088 --> 01:04:10,963
William.

1044
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:14,713
-Habibi.
-[pilot laughs] Kaifa halak?

1045
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:17,046
-You made it.
-[pilot] Count on me.

1046
01:04:17,213 --> 01:04:18,046
Mosquito bite?

1047
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:20,088
[William] Yeah, a little one.

1048
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:22,130
-Feels worse than it looks.
-[pilot laughs]

1049
01:04:24,171 --> 01:04:26,171
Now how the hell are we all gonna fit
in that?

1050
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:29,505
-[pilot] Come when you're ready.
-[man over radio] Copy.

1051
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:32,005
-[helicopter blades whirring]
-[William] Feel free to count it.

1052
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:33,505
I know where to find you.

1053
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,505
Voilà!

1054
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:02,296
[shouts] It won't all fit in the net!

1055
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,380
We gotta get the rest on it inside!

1056
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:11,880
[both speaking Spanish]

1057
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:15,421
I don't know if that scale's fucked up,

1058
01:05:15,505 --> 01:05:18,088
but he's telling me
we got 6,000 pounds here.

1059
01:05:18,171 --> 01:05:20,755
That's $250 million.

1060
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:22,671
We stole 250 million?

1061
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:25,213
I'm definitely getting that Ferrari!

1062
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,255
-Are you sure?
-Let's go!

1063
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:29,005
If that scale is even close
to being right,

1064
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:30,463
we're gonna have a weight issue.

1065
01:05:30,546 --> 01:05:33,630
What's the issue?
This helo can carry 9,000 pounds.

1066
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:37,505
That's 9,000 at 2,000 feet.

1067
01:05:37,588 --> 01:05:41,380
If we want to get to the ocean,
we gotta fly over the fucking Andes, man.

1068
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,838
Are we really leaving $200 million
on the fucking runway?

1069
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:51,046
Okay, she'll make it. Let's go!

1070
01:05:52,546 --> 01:05:55,380
What's your plan for her?
We're already overweight as it is.

1071
01:05:56,046 --> 01:05:58,755
We promised them a ride
over the border into Peru.

1072
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:01,130
And we're gonna stand by that!

1073
01:07:05,213 --> 01:07:08,630
Okay, we're gonna let you go now.

1074
01:07:08,713 --> 01:07:09,630
Thank you.

1075
01:07:09,713 --> 01:07:11,380
[Tom] I just need to know something.

1076
01:07:11,963 --> 01:07:13,130
What's my name?

1077
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:15,463
I-- I don't know.

1078
01:07:15,546 --> 01:07:17,963
What about your buddy back there?
What's his name?

1079
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:20,171
I don't know.

1080
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,171
He said he couldn't tell me.

1081
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:26,630
Okay, I want you to be real careful...
about what you're about to say

1082
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:30,713
because the only thing
that ties us to them is you.

1083
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,921
Now, when you finally had sex,

1084
01:07:37,005 --> 01:07:40,088
and you rolled over and looked him
in the eye and said,

1085
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:42,796
"What's your real name?"
What did he say?

1086
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,088
That never happened.

1087
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,963
I can just go ask him.

1088
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:48,338
He never told me where he was from.

1089
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:50,671
He said that you served together...

1090
01:07:52,296 --> 01:07:53,546
and that you were honest.

1091
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,213
Why'd he say that?

1092
01:07:56,838 --> 01:07:58,171
Because I asked him if...

1093
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:02,005
if he wasn't afraid of you cheating him.

1094
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:03,755
That's why.

1095
01:08:04,588 --> 01:08:05,838
Everything all right?

1096
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,213
No!

1097
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:15,755
[in Spanish]
Here's three million dollars.

1098
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:20,255
And two tickets
with visas to Sydney, Australia.

1099
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:25,588
On the way to the airport,
stop at this shipping company.

1100
01:08:26,296 --> 01:08:29,713
Make sure to send the boxes
to this hotel in Sydney.

1101
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:34,046
You know that's a lot more
than 75 million dollars in there.

1102
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,046
[in English] What does that mean?

1103
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,213
It's not just Lorea's money in there.

1104
01:08:40,046 --> 01:08:42,130
A lot more people
are gonna come looking after you.

1105
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:47,296
I can deal with that.
But do not stay in South America

1106
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,421
because they will find you
and they will kill you.

1107
01:08:51,088 --> 01:08:53,005
[in Spanish]
Promise me that you won't stay here.

1108
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:53,963
-Yes!
-Promise me!

1109
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,130
I promise you.

1110
01:08:56,005 --> 01:08:58,463
[in English] How... How do I contact you?

1111
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:00,005
You can't.

1112
01:09:03,296 --> 01:09:05,505
You did everything right.

1113
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:07,546
You deserve this.

1114
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:12,671
[in Spanish] Take care of yourselves.

1115
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:14,046
[brother, in English] Thank you.

1116
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:15,713
Go!

1117
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:39,755
She's lying.

1118
01:09:41,546 --> 01:09:42,546
No, she's not.

1119
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,755
There are consequences to this shit.

1120
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,296
You know what we should have done?

1121
01:09:54,505 --> 01:09:56,463
That's one you wouldn't come back from.

1122
01:10:10,755 --> 01:10:12,338
[Frankie] The weight drags
at higher altitudes.

1123
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:15,130
I'd like to stay under 5,000 feet
till we hit the Andes.

1124
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:17,338
Ocean in four hours.

1125
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,088
Roger that. Nice work.

1126
01:10:23,005 --> 01:10:24,130
[sighs]

1127
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:34,088
[Frankie] I'm gonna try
between these two bigger peaks.

1128
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:36,296
Find this valley I saw on the map.

1129
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,380
[Tom] Roger.

1130
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:56,088
[gentle rattling]

1131
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:09,421
[Frankie] Just one last push
through the Andes.

1132
01:11:14,338 --> 01:11:16,088
[Tom] How high do you think that is?

1133
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:19,046
[Frankie]
It's gotta be 11,000. Can't fly that high.

1134
01:11:19,838 --> 01:11:22,921
[Tom] Shouldn't have to.
Head for that lower ridge.

1135
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,213
How are we doing up here, boys?

1136
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:29,421
Can we make it over?

1137
01:11:30,171 --> 01:11:31,046
I don't know.

1138
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:33,505
What the fuck is going on up here?

1139
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:34,421
Go for it.

1140
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,880
[engine whirring]

1141
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:40,630
All right, baby. All right, baby.

1142
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,588
Come on, now.

1143
01:11:46,005 --> 01:11:47,963
-All right, baby.
-[alert beeping]

1144
01:11:48,046 --> 01:11:50,296
-We're redlining, man.
-It's close, though.

1145
01:11:56,171 --> 01:11:57,921
It's too much weight.
It's too much fucking weight.

1146
01:11:58,713 --> 01:12:00,171
We're never gonna make it.

1147
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:03,296
-What does that mean?
-It means we're losing fucking money.

1148
01:12:03,755 --> 01:12:05,838
You wanna leave $50 million
in the middle of the jungle?

1149
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,380
Do you wanna get to the ocean?

1150
01:12:07,963 --> 01:12:09,588
All right, go do it.

1151
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:13,713
I got it!

1152
01:12:28,338 --> 01:12:29,255
[Santiago grunts]

1153
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:40,088
[Santiago grunts] All right, let me check.

1154
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,338
-[alarm beeping]
-How's she feeling now?

1155
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:53,755
[Frankie] That's feeling better.

1156
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:56,463
Come on. Come on.

1157
01:12:56,963 --> 01:12:58,963
[rattling]

1158
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,671
Come on.

1159
01:13:06,255 --> 01:13:08,463
[whirring]

1160
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,921
[alarm beeping rapidly]

1161
01:13:17,005 --> 01:13:18,588
[engine sputters]

1162
01:13:22,296 --> 01:13:24,213
What the fuck are you doing, Catfish?

1163
01:13:24,296 --> 01:13:26,088
One of the gearboxes is blown.

1164
01:13:26,421 --> 01:13:27,338
What?

1165
01:13:27,713 --> 01:13:29,338
I don't want to go into a spin.

1166
01:13:37,421 --> 01:13:39,296
[grunts]
Okay, we might be in trouble here.

1167
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:40,546
[sighs]

1168
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,796
[Frankie] I'm losing altitude.

1169
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:48,796
[grunts]
Ah, we should land. We should land now.

1170
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,755
Crash-land here, and we all die.

1171
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:53,130
I'm trying to get her back to flat.

1172
01:13:53,213 --> 01:13:55,005
Roger. Prepare for a hard landing!

1173
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:01,421
[Tom] There should be a farmer's field
on the other side of that ridge.

1174
01:14:02,088 --> 01:14:04,755
-We passed it on the way up.
-[Frankie] I remember it.

1175
01:14:08,088 --> 01:14:10,088
[engine sputtering]

1176
01:14:10,838 --> 01:14:12,921
[Frankie]
I can't land this with that bag under us.

1177
01:14:13,005 --> 01:14:15,005
We should lose the money,
maybe we don't die.

1178
01:14:15,838 --> 01:14:18,921
Lose the money, or we're all gonna die!

1179
01:14:19,005 --> 01:14:22,171
Hit the external load release.
It's on the wall!

1180
01:14:22,963 --> 01:14:24,505
Pull the lever, Ben!

1181
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:30,005
[William groans]

1182
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,421
It didn't work!

1183
01:14:35,296 --> 01:14:37,046
[Frankie]
There should be a manual override

1184
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:38,088
on the cargo hook.

1185
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,963
Let me through!

1186
01:14:51,796 --> 01:14:53,130
[grunts]

1187
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:56,380

-[William] Benny!
-[screams]

1189
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:05,213
All right, I'm gonna try to land here.

1190
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:09,880
[screams]

1191
01:15:10,588 --> 01:15:11,838
I gotta jump!

-[William] Benny!

1193
01:15:17,671 --> 01:15:18,671
[screams]

1194
01:15:22,963 --> 01:15:23,963
Bad landing.

1195
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:27,463
-[grunting]
-[alarm blaring]

1196
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:28,546

1197
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:54,755
Fish! Fish!

1198
01:15:56,713 --> 01:15:59,546
-You all right?
-Yeah, I think so. I think so.

1199
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:01,296
Yo, Benny!

1200
01:16:02,005 --> 01:16:03,130
-Benny!
-[Santiago grunts]

1201
01:16:03,213 --> 01:16:05,713
-[Benny] I'm here!
-[Santiago] Come on, we gotta move.

1202
01:16:06,505 --> 01:16:07,963
-Come on!
-[Frankie groans]

1203
01:16:09,255 --> 01:16:11,338
[William grunts]
Let's get our shit outta here.

1204
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:12,796
[Santiago] Try and get up to it.

1205
01:16:13,213 --> 01:16:15,630
-[Benny] Fish!
-I need oxygen. [grunts]

01:27:59,713 --> 01:28:01,921
[Tom] God damn this fucking horse!
Stop it!

1377
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,130
-Yes. It's fine.
-Relax. Relax.

1378
01:28:05,796 --> 01:28:08,255
We're not picking at the fucking scab
right now, okay?

1379
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,713
One foot in front of the other.

1380
01:28:10,796 --> 01:28:11,838
All right? Come on.

1381
01:28:12,171 --> 01:28:14,005
Let's go. Jesus fucking Christ.

1382
01:28:28,296 --> 01:28:30,505
[both panting]

1383
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,880
[grunting]

1384
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:41,588
[Benny] Oh, come on.

1385
01:28:42,505 --> 01:28:43,380
[groans]

1386
01:28:44,838 --> 01:28:47,296
Are you sure you want me
to get rid of the mules?

1387
01:28:47,463 --> 01:28:51,338
[William] This rock side's 20-foot deep.
We're not getting the mules through.

1388
01:28:55,005 --> 01:28:56,880
Yeah, it's on us now!

1389
01:28:58,963 --> 01:29:01,755
[Frankie shouts] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1390
01:29:01,838 --> 01:29:04,255
-[mules bray]
-[Frankie shouts]

1391
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:07,296
[Santiago] Look at the mules.

1392
01:29:09,255 --> 01:29:11,296
Well, if we can get over this,

1393
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,630
it should be all downhill
to the ocean from here.

1394
01:29:17,755 --> 01:29:19,046
[men grunting]

1395
01:29:23,296 --> 01:29:24,963
[Santiago] I got it. I got it. I got it.

1396
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:30,755
[both pant]

1397
01:29:32,171 --> 01:29:34,255
[Santiago] All right, come on up!

1398
01:29:36,588 --> 01:29:38,171
-Nice work.
-You, too.

1399
01:29:41,505 --> 01:29:43,505
Look, I talked a lot of shit back there.

1400
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:44,755
I didn't mean that.

1401
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,630
-Don't worry about it.
-No, no, it's...

1402
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,338
This is on me.

1403
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:53,046
-It's... all on me.
-No, man, it's...

1404
01:29:54,338 --> 01:29:55,588
I'm on the hook for this.

1405
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:58,921
You know? It is what it is. [sniffles]

1406
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,546
Yeah, it is what it is.

1407
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,296
-I am a bit of a dick, though.
-[chuckles]

1408
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:11,171
[sighs]

1409
01:30:29,088 --> 01:30:31,588
You could freeze an Eskimo's asshole
out here.

1410
01:30:33,046 --> 01:30:34,255
I demand a fire.

1411
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:38,046
[sighs] We cold camp.

1412
01:30:40,505 --> 01:30:42,505
[sighs, sniffles]

1413
01:30:43,088 --> 01:30:44,171

[lighter clicks]

1415
01:30:54,005 --> 01:30:55,005
Fuck you.

1416
01:30:56,713 --> 01:30:58,421
This is my "fuck you" money.

1417
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:01,546
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

1418
01:31:05,296 --> 01:31:06,505
[chuckles]

1419
01:31:06,588 --> 01:31:08,588
[laughing] We don't have enough men
to carry this money,

1420
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,255
so we might as well be warm. [sniffles]

1421
01:31:22,671 --> 01:31:23,838
[lighter clicks]

1422
01:31:24,421 --> 01:31:25,296
Oh, Jesus.

1423
01:31:26,255 --> 01:31:28,130
[Frankie] Jesus Christ. [laughs]

1424
01:31:28,255 --> 01:31:30,255
[all laughing]

1425
01:31:31,921 --> 01:31:33,005
[Benny] Ah.

1426
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:44,630
-[Frankie] That's more like it.
-[Santiago] Este loco...

1427
01:31:47,463 --> 01:31:50,713
-Oh! Oh, my God! Holy shit.
-[all laugh]

1428
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:54,213
[Tom] Now that's a fire!

[gunshot]

1435
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,713
-[Tom] Oh, shit! Shit.
-[William] Ah, Fuck.

1436
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:35,755
[Benny] I'm hit!

1437
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,921
[gunshots]

1438
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:42,130
-[William] Benny, you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Just grazed my shoulder.

1439
01:32:42,838 --> 01:32:44,421
Shooter's up on the ridge line.

1440
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:51,505
Oh, he likes me so much.
I'll stay here, hold his fire.

1441
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:52,713
You guys go around the side.

1442
01:32:54,255 --> 01:32:55,838
Pope, can you step out?

1443
01:32:56,713 --> 01:32:57,921
Work up the trailhead.

1444
01:32:58,546 --> 01:32:59,463
All right.

1445
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:02,005
Flank right, make sure no one else
is coming up below.

1446
01:33:03,046 --> 01:33:04,046
I'll cut up behind you.

1447
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:06,130
Benny, you all right?

1448
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:09,880
[Benny] Yeah, I'm fine. We'll hold
down here until you get into position.

1449
01:33:12,213 --> 01:33:14,088
[gunfire continues]

1450
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:28,421
[gunshot]

1451
01:33:30,046 --> 01:33:32,005
I think Pope's in position right now.

1452
01:33:32,088 --> 01:33:33,130
Yeah, let's move.

1453
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:36,338
[gunshot]

1454
01:33:36,713 --> 01:33:38,046

-[gunshot echoes]
-[grunts]

1459
01:35:03,546 --> 01:35:04,713
[Benny] Tom!

1460
01:35:04,921 --> 01:35:06,088
Tom!

1461
01:35:06,421 --> 01:35:09,255
Tom. Come on... Come on.

1462
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:20,963
[sobbing] Come on, Tom. Come on, man.

1463
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:23,588
Come on, man. Come on...

1464
01:35:30,338 --> 01:35:31,880
[William] Let me see. Let me see.

1465
01:35:34,921 --> 01:35:36,421
[Benny] Oh, my God!

1466
01:35:49,796 --> 01:35:51,088
Let's get him wrapped up.

1467
01:35:51,838 --> 01:35:53,130
We need to keep moving.

1468
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,796
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-[sighs]

1469
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,671
You're a heartless son of a bitch!

1470
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:05,630
It was your little fire
that got him fucking killed!

1471
01:36:11,005 --> 01:36:12,338
[shouts]

1472
01:36:14,338 --> 01:36:15,255
[groans]

1473
01:36:16,213 --> 01:36:17,296
[quietly] Stop it.

1474
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,546
[both grunting]

1475
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:21,338
Stop this shit. Stop this shit.

1476
01:36:21,421 --> 01:36:23,296
-[Benny shouting]
-[Santiago] Fucking stop this!

1477
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,755
Stop this shit! Stop it!

1478
01:36:25,838 --> 01:36:28,671
-Stop this shit!
-[William] Fuck you, Benny! Fuck you!

1479
01:36:29,546 --> 01:36:32,255
It wasn't the fire that gave us away.

1480
01:36:33,671 --> 01:36:34,838
That kid was from the village.

1481
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:38,630
He's been tracking us for days.

1482
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,171
He obviously wanted a clear shot at Tom.

1483
01:36:43,838 --> 01:36:44,796
He wanted him.

1484
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,921
But we do have to get
the fuck out of here,

1485
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:53,171
and we are taking
all of that money with us.

1486
01:36:53,796 --> 01:36:55,630
Tom's family deserves it!

1487
01:36:56,755 --> 01:36:57,713
And so do we.

1488
01:37:01,255 --> 01:37:03,296
All right, let's wrap him up.
We carry him down.

1489
01:37:28,255 --> 01:37:29,630
Rest in peace, brother.

1490
01:37:33,338 --> 01:37:35,296
You rest in peace. [sniffles]

Five days.

there and back?

1524
01:39:53,588 --> 01:39:54,630
You watch yours.

[bird calling]

1526
01:40:17,463 --> 01:40:19,463
I'm gonna say something.
Are you listening?

1527
01:40:21,546 --> 01:40:22,380
Yeah.

1528
01:40:23,838 --> 01:40:25,421
We gotta get back on our game.

1529
01:40:27,005 --> 01:40:29,338
Enough of this. It stops now.
You understand?

1530
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:32,213
Copy that.

1531
01:40:33,005 --> 01:40:33,880
[Frankie] Good.

1532
01:40:38,171 --> 01:40:39,963
How many people
do you think you've killed?

1533
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,796
[Frankie] What?

1534
01:40:43,046 --> 01:40:44,046
[William] You heard me.

1535
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:48,213
As many as I had to.

1536
01:40:48,713 --> 01:40:50,171
Why would you ever wanna know that?

1537
01:40:53,463 --> 01:40:55,463
-Forty-three.
-Jesus!

1538
01:40:56,588 --> 01:40:57,463
Confirmed.

01:40:58,588 --> 01:41:00,713

You keep count of everything, huh?

1540
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:03,505
Yep.

01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:05,421
How's your sleep?

1542
01:41:09,338 --> 01:41:11,005
I guess better than it should be.

[Benny] The boat's there.

1547
01:41:39,963 --> 01:41:41,463
I gave him half the money.

1548
01:41:41,755 --> 01:41:42,796
I hope he waits.

1549
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,588
I didn't go into town,

1550
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:49,005
but it looks like
whoever's in charge there...

1551
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:53,463
has a... kindergarten army
that's looking for us.

1552
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:56,546
-[William] How many of them?
-Two or three pros,

1553
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,005
20 heavily-armed teenagers.

1554
01:42:00,463 --> 01:42:01,838
What about the next town over?

1555
01:42:01,921 --> 01:42:03,838
[Santiago]
It's over 100 miles to the south.

1556
01:42:04,088 --> 01:42:06,380
I'm sure they've got
every town covered anyway.

1557
01:42:07,296 --> 01:42:09,505
Must be what's left of Lorea's guys.

1558
01:42:09,796 --> 01:42:10,921
So we go through 'em.

1559
01:42:12,088 --> 01:42:13,130
[sighs]

1560
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:14,755
Through them?

1561
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:16,505
What, do you mean we mow them all down?

1562
01:42:16,588 --> 01:42:17,755
What's the alternative here?

1563
01:42:17,838 --> 01:42:18,713
[sighs]

1564
01:42:18,796 --> 01:42:22,213
I'm not prepared
to wipe out every teenager in that town

1565
01:42:22,463 --> 01:42:24,505
just to get through with this cargo.

1566
01:42:24,796 --> 01:42:25,921
[Santiago] This cargo?

1567
01:42:27,296 --> 01:42:28,755
What about that cargo?

1568
01:42:29,796 --> 01:42:31,088
Will you do it for him?

1569
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,380
Tom died for this money,

1570
01:42:34,463 --> 01:42:36,088
and we're not leaving this country
without it!

1571
01:42:36,171 --> 01:42:38,796
He didn't die for that money,
he died because of it!

1572
01:42:45,255 --> 01:42:46,630
[Benny] They're just kids, man.

1573
01:42:46,713 --> 01:42:48,338
Can't we carry it out through the dark?

1574
01:42:48,796 --> 01:42:50,921
[William] It's over 100 bags.
There's no way.

1575
01:42:51,838 --> 01:42:53,088
Let me talk to him.

1576
01:42:54,755 --> 01:42:55,630
[sighs]

1577
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:02,880
Look, Benny's telling us these are kids,
man.

1578
01:43:07,296 --> 01:43:10,338
I can't believe...
I can't believe I let this happen.

1579
01:43:11,921 --> 01:43:14,588
Look, we all came here
of our own free will.

1580
01:43:16,171 --> 01:43:17,046
Yeah, but...

1581
01:43:17,546 --> 01:43:20,796
I thought we could...
I thought we could do this.

1582
01:43:21,671 --> 01:43:22,505
[sighs]

1583
01:43:23,046 --> 01:43:24,130
Yeah.

1584
01:43:25,588 --> 01:43:27,171
And we got what we deserved.

1585
01:43:29,463 --> 01:43:30,421
I'm sorry.

1586
01:43:31,755 --> 01:43:32,588
Yeah, me, too.

1587
01:43:33,796 --> 01:43:35,588
-But we can't do this.
-I know.

1588
01:43:36,421 --> 01:43:37,380
I know.

1589
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:51,505
We can't just... go through 'em.

1590
01:43:52,421 --> 01:43:53,921
I don't know what I was saying.

1591
01:43:55,505 --> 01:43:56,380
It's all right.

1592
01:43:57,088 --> 01:43:58,588
We've just gotta get Tom home.

1593
01:43:59,546 --> 01:44:00,588
That's all that matters.

1594
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:03,255
How are we gonna do that?

1595
01:44:03,671 --> 01:44:05,171
[Santiago] We keep carrying him down.

1596
01:44:06,088 --> 01:44:08,213
We fill our days packs
with whatever we can...

1597
01:44:09,088 --> 01:44:11,046
Whatever we can carry, and that's it.

1598
01:44:12,005 --> 01:44:13,505
What do we do with the rest of it?

1599
01:44:22,088 --> 01:44:23,088
[Santiago sighs]

1600
01:44:32,171 --> 01:44:33,130
Fuck.

1601
01:44:34,088 --> 01:44:35,130
[grunts]

1602
01:44:39,338 --> 01:44:40,338
[crashes]

1603
01:44:40,921 --> 01:44:43,171
[exhales] Fuck me.

1604
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:44,505
That'll work.

1605
01:44:45,255 --> 01:44:46,838
Snow will be coming in soon.

1606
01:44:48,671 --> 01:44:50,255
Nobody'll ever see it again.

1607
01:44:51,838 --> 01:44:52,755
Good.

1608
01:44:56,838 --> 01:44:58,130
All right, let's keep going.

1609
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:30,005
[Santiago, softly]
Let's put him down for a second.

1610
01:45:31,463 --> 01:45:33,380
[all grunt]

1611
01:45:37,505 --> 01:45:38,838
[William] We're running behind.

1612
01:45:38,921 --> 01:45:40,880
Benny, you should go.
The sun's coming up.

1613
01:45:41,838 --> 01:45:43,713
[Santiago]
We'll meet you down at the cove in 30.

1614
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,296
-[Benny] All right. Be careful.
-[William] Always.

1615
01:45:51,463 --> 01:45:52,380
[Frankie grunts]

1616
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:55,463
[William grunts]

1617
01:45:58,671 --> 01:46:00,005
[indistinct chatter]

1618
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,088
[dogs barking]

1619
01:46:04,963 --> 01:46:07,421
-[dance music playing on stereo]
-[teens laughing]

1620
01:46:12,796 --> 01:46:14,796
-[woman exclaims]
-[bottle smashes]

1621
01:46:31,463 --> 01:46:33,213
[indistinct radio chatter]

1622
01:46:42,713 --> 01:46:44,421
[Benny, in Spanish]
Thank you for waiting.

1623
01:46:46,005 --> 01:46:47,588
[captain] The boat is ready.

1624
01:46:49,546 --> 01:46:50,921
[William sighs]

1625
01:46:53,505 --> 01:46:54,963
[William, in English] No, wait. Whoa.

1626
01:46:56,546 --> 01:46:57,505
Is there anyone?

1627
01:46:59,338 --> 01:47:01,338
-It looks abandoned.
-Cover me.

1628
01:47:05,046 --> 01:47:06,546
[fighter] Stop! [in Spanish] Hands up!

1629
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:09,588
-[in English] Stop!
-Put your hands up!

1630
01:47:09,671 --> 01:47:11,130
[Santiago, in Spanish] Wait! Wait!

1631
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,213
[panting]

1632
01:47:14,296 --> 01:47:15,171
Listen!

1633
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:19,505
Little brother, be careful with that gun.
Don't point it at me.

1634
01:47:19,588 --> 01:47:23,130
[in English] I speak English! [grunts]
What's in the bag? What is that?

1635
01:47:23,213 --> 01:47:24,171
[William] It's our friend.

1636
01:47:24,921 --> 01:47:27,546
-He's dead.
-I call boss.

1637
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:29,588
-[in Spanish] No, don't do that.
-[in English] Stop!

1638
01:47:31,005 --> 01:47:33,338
[Santiago, in Spanish]
We don't have any problem with you.

1639
01:47:34,005 --> 01:47:35,005
[in English] Right, guys?

1640
01:47:35,088 --> 01:47:36,421
-We don't have a problem with him.
-No problem.

1641
01:47:36,505 --> 01:47:39,296
-I'm taking a shot.
-No! No. Don't do that.

1642
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:40,880
[in Spanish] It's okay.

1643
01:47:40,963 --> 01:47:42,213
[inhales sharply] Uh-uh.

1644
01:47:44,546 --> 01:47:46,213
[Santiago] Hey, calm down.

1645
01:47:46,671 --> 01:47:48,921
[fighter] This is 16! I need help!
[grunts]

1646
01:47:49,005 --> 01:47:51,505
[man speaks Spanish over radio]

1647
01:47:51,588 --> 01:47:52,588
Dumbass!

1648
01:47:52,671 --> 01:47:53,963
-[Santiago] Where are the keys?
-I don't know.

1649
01:47:54,046 --> 01:47:56,880
They just left me here with just the car
and the radio. [sniffles]

1650
01:47:57,088 --> 01:47:58,046
[in English] Fuck!

1651
01:47:58,421 --> 01:47:59,546
-[Santiago, in Spanish] Are you sure?
-Yes.

1652
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:00,463
[Santiago] Are you lying?

1653
01:48:00,546 --> 01:48:02,713
[in English]
Hey, hey, kid, just relax, all right?

1654
01:48:02,796 --> 01:48:05,838
[man over radio, in Spanish]
Sixteen? Sixteen, is that you?

1655
01:48:05,921 --> 01:48:07,880
We're going to send someone.

1656
01:48:08,921 --> 01:48:10,421
[engine starts and revs]

1657
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,755
[in English] Yes! Fuck yes!

1658
01:48:12,838 --> 01:48:14,171
Let's move. Let's get it outta here.

1659
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:17,296
-[Santiago] Grab his radio.
-[William] Got it.

1660
01:48:22,255 --> 01:48:23,671
[Santiago, in Spanish]
Here's a little advice:

1661
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:25,755
[Frankie grunts]

1662
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:26,963
Get away from these men.

1663
01:48:27,046 --> 01:48:28,130
[Frankie, in English] Let's move!

1664
01:48:28,213 --> 01:48:29,963
[in Spanish] Go home. Get out of here.

1665
01:48:30,046 --> 01:48:31,630
[Frankie] Vamos, Pope!

1666
01:48:34,213 --> 01:48:35,130
[Santiago sighs]

1667
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,380
[in English]
Did you give that fucking kid money?

1668
01:48:39,463 --> 01:48:41,880
We should have killed that kid
as soon as he saw our faces.

1669
01:48:41,963 --> 01:48:43,713
We are not killing any more people.

1670
01:48:44,171 --> 01:48:47,046
I'll tell you right now, if we get
to that beach and Ben isn't there,

1671
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,421
I'm fucking killing people.

1672
01:48:48,505 --> 01:48:50,755
-All right, he'll be there. Fuck!
-[car approaching]

1673
01:48:50,838 --> 01:48:52,546
[tires screech]

1674
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:54,505
Shit.

1675
01:48:56,505 --> 01:48:57,546
[William] Fuck.

1676
01:48:59,505 --> 01:49:01,171
[teens screaming]

1677
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:06,630
-Come on! Come on!
-Can we go?

1678
01:49:06,713 --> 01:49:07,838
[engine revs]

1679
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:08,963
[teens speaking Spanish]

1680
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:10,796
What the hell is this?

1681
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:11,713
Shit!

1682
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:13,671
[teen on radio in Spanish] They crashed
into us! Look out, be careful!

1683
01:49:13,755 --> 01:49:16,880
-They're heading to the beach.
-[man on radio] They just passed.

1684
01:49:16,963 --> 01:49:19,171
-Everybody head towards the palm trees.
-[in English] What did he say?

1685
01:49:19,255 --> 01:49:21,713
-[Frankie] More are coming.
-There's two vehicles!

1686
01:49:21,796 --> 01:49:24,213
All right, it should open up
onto the beach any minute.

1687
01:49:24,296 --> 01:49:25,463
Pope, shoot!

1688
01:49:25,546 --> 01:49:26,380
Fuck!

1689
01:49:26,463 --> 01:49:29,880
Shoot the driver! What is wrong with you?

1690
01:49:30,963 --> 01:49:32,005
[man, in Spanish] Give some room!

1691
01:49:32,088 --> 01:49:34,046
-[in English] Left!
-[man, in Spanish] They're firing!

1692
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:36,463
Stay behind!

1693
01:49:40,921 --> 01:49:42,171
[gunfire]

1694
01:49:58,588 --> 01:50:00,005
[in English] They're right on us!

1695
01:50:11,213 --> 01:50:12,338
Where are they?

1696
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,630
Left! Left!

1697
01:50:18,713 --> 01:50:20,921
[teens shouting in Spanish]

1698
01:50:21,255 --> 01:50:22,255
Left!

1699
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:25,088
[passengers scream]

1700
01:50:25,338 --> 01:50:26,588
[William] Goddamn!

1701
01:50:27,755 --> 01:50:29,171
All right, here's the beach.

1702
01:50:35,588 --> 01:50:37,171
Where is he? Do you see him?

1703
01:50:37,963 --> 01:50:41,921
No, but the cove where we're supposed
to meet him's about a mile up this beach.

1704
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:49,463
[motor revs]

1705
01:50:50,171 --> 01:50:51,671
[gunfire]

1706
01:51:00,505 --> 01:51:01,755
Pope, kill them!

1707
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:03,755
Just kill them!

1708
01:51:07,213 --> 01:51:08,296
[tire blows]

1709
01:51:15,296 --> 01:51:16,588
There it is!

1710
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:25,505
-Do I wave him in?
-[William] Hell yeah!

1711
01:51:26,921 --> 01:51:27,921
Go!

1712
01:51:28,171 --> 01:51:29,796
It looks like this is the end of the road.

1713
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,963
[Frankie] I see it.

1714
01:51:31,255 --> 01:51:34,380
We gotta cross over the dune!
Cross over the dune!

1715
01:51:55,296 --> 01:51:56,213
Let's go!

1716
01:52:07,088 --> 01:52:08,588
[grunting]

1717
01:52:08,838 --> 01:52:09,838
[Benny] Come on!

1718
01:52:10,713 --> 01:52:12,796
[Santiago groans]

[peaceful instrumental music playing]

1722
01:53:07,713 --> 01:53:10,796
[woman] Minus the expenses,
and our administrative fee,

1723
01:53:11,255 --> 01:53:16,463
that leaves $5,334,120...

1724
01:53:17,171 --> 01:53:18,296
cut five ways.

1725
01:53:18,588 --> 01:53:23,630
Which gives you five shares of $1,066,824.

1726
01:53:24,296 --> 01:53:27,755
Oh, and I need all of your signatures
on the fifth contract here.

1727
01:53:28,296 --> 01:53:32,213
It'll deposit the deceased's share
into the Redfly Family Trust.

1728
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,338
Here you are.

1729
01:53:50,671 --> 01:53:53,796
I'd like you to please include my share
into the family trust.

1730
01:54:11,130 --> 01:54:12,505
[door opens, closes]

1731
01:54:17,296 --> 01:54:18,213
Me, too.

1732
01:54:25,505 --> 01:54:26,380
Thank you.

1733
01:54:35,588 --> 01:54:36,796
[door closes]

1734
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:48,255
[door opens, closes]

1735
01:54:54,588 --> 01:54:57,755
[woman] So, I will schedule
all the payments to the family trust.

1736
01:55:00,213 --> 01:55:01,130
Of course.

1737
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,005
-Thank you. That's for you.
-Thank you. I'll be in touch.

1738
01:55:20,713 --> 01:55:22,713
[indistinct chatter]

1739
01:55:30,796 --> 01:55:33,130
[sighs]
So, what are you guys gonna do now?

1740
01:55:35,421 --> 01:55:36,796
I gotta get home. [chuckles]

1741
01:55:38,171 --> 01:55:39,380
Not without these.

1742
01:55:44,963 --> 01:55:46,671
That'll help. [chuckles]

1743
01:55:58,005 --> 01:55:59,088
[in Spanish] See you.

1744
01:56:03,005 --> 01:56:04,213
Take care of yourself.

1745
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:12,213
[in English] See you, buddy.

1746
01:56:14,338 --> 01:56:15,380
Love you, man.

1747
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:17,088
[clicks tongue] I love you, too.

1748
01:56:21,421 --> 01:56:23,421
-I'll see you in a bit, all right?
-[Benny] See you.

1749
01:56:32,046 --> 01:56:33,421
So, what you gonna do now?

1750
01:56:36,421 --> 01:56:38,463
[sighs] I don't know.

1751
01:56:39,963 --> 01:56:41,005
Maybe I'll, uh...

1752
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:44,005
I'll go see this girl I know in Australia.

1753
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:49,338
Yeah, you should.
I hear she recently came into some money.

1754
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:53,130
I guess she made out
a whole hell of a lot better

1755
01:56:53,213 --> 01:56:54,255
than any of us did.

1756
01:56:55,421 --> 01:56:56,838
That seems about right.

1757
01:57:00,588 --> 01:57:02,630
When you see Molly and the girls...

1758
01:57:06,505 --> 01:57:08,713
remind them who he was.

1759
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:10,296
Yeah, I will.

1760
01:57:18,588 --> 01:57:20,171
Take care of yourself, all right?

1761
01:57:20,921 --> 01:57:21,755
You, too.

1762
01:57:24,421 --> 01:57:27,088
[William] Maybe we can go
do something good with it one day.

1763
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:34,046
