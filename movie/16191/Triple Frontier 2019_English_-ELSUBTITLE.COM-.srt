1
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,755
<i>I have the honor today to introduce you</i>

2
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:32,130
<i>to Retired Captain William Miller.</i>

3
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:35,338
<i>He's been everywhere in the world
you all wanna go...</i>

4
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:37,380
<i>and a bunch of places you don't.</i>

5
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,171
I've asked him to come
and talk to you all today

6
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:42,713
at this important crossroad
in your careers.

7
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:45,713
I'm gonna step out
so this conversation can be frank

8
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,255
and to the point.

9
00:00:59,963 --> 00:01:03,171
About five years ago,
when I was on leave...

10
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:08,546
...I found myself standing in the middle
of the cereal aisle at the Publix...

11
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:12,755
with my arm around some guy's throat.

12
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,671
I was squeezing so hard he pissed himself.

13
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:20,671
My fiancée at the time had to climb
on my back

14
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,755
just so I didn't actually kill the guy.

15
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:26,005
Do you know why I was doing this?

16
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,921
Because he hadn't moved his cart
when I asked.

17
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:33,088
I was the best of the best,

18
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:37,838
able to shut down, control, manipulate...

19
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:41,671
all basic human instincts
towards one goal:

20
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,671
the completion of my mission.

21
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:52,088
But the effects of committing
extreme violence on other human beings

22
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,338
are biological

23
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:55,838
and physiological.

24
00:01:57,755 --> 00:01:59,713
That's the price of being a warrior.

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,130
<i>Is everything clear in the valley?</i>

26
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,963
Affirmative!

27
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,213
<i>Copy that.</i>

28
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:33,630
Enter, enter, enter!

29
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,255
<i>Let's go!</i>

30
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,421
<i>Enter, enter, enter.</i>

31
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,171
<i>Let me inform you</i>

32
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:02,005
<i>that we have you surrounded.</i>

33
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,421
So, put down your weapons,

34
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,046
come out of the building

35
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,421
<i>with your hands behind your head.</i>

36
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,005
How many did you say were in there?

37
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,505
No more than ten.

38
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,463
No, no, no!

39
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:54,338
You guys hold this position.

40
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:56,796
We're going to find other cover.

41
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,963
But hold here.

42
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,463
Good.

43
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:01,421
Rodriguez!

44
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,921
Rodriguez, can you hold your position?

45
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,463
<i>Rodriguez!</i>

46
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,713
Fuck no!

47
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:12,046
<i>We need to get back.</i>

48
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,421
I said, maintain your positions.

49
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:17,088
<i>- Hold on!</i>
- Move him! Move him!

50
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,463
Rodriguez?

51
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:36,713
Rodriguez?

52
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:41,463
<i>Rodriguez!</i>

53
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,171
Diego!

54
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:44,171
<i>Hold on!</i>

55
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:04,921
Advance.

56
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,296
Nice shot.

57
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:35,171
I'm so tired of arresting all of you

58
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,755
only to simply find you all here again.

59
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:42,171
Oh, my adviser is here.

60
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,630
Ready, brother?

61
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,463
America is listening.

62
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:48,713
Take the money, brother.

63
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:50,171
It's $400,000.

64
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:51,380
You lose nothing.

65
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:54,005
I already have the money.

66
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:57,380
And... and Lorea?

67
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,796
What was it that you said?

68
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:13,046
Now you're turning on your own boss?

69
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:15,546
I know where he is.

70
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,046
Fucking snitch. Shh!

71
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:19,880
Where's that?

72
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:22,130
In Mexico? Disneyland?

73
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:23,046
Where?

74
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,588
No, no.

75
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,588
He's hiding in the jungle, my brother.

76
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:30,505
He went there
because he doesn't trust banks

77
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,880
or any of those things anymore.

78
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,130
Sir, you could find him.

79
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:39,671
You just got yourself killed, fucker.

80
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:40,630
Silence!

81
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,463
Lift up, lift up your little face.

82
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,463
Is this guy telling me the truth?

83
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:32,755
Does anyone else out here want to try
to assault a police officer?

84
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:38,005
Or tell fairy tales about Mr. Lorea?

85
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:39,921
Huh?

86
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:43,296
Take them to the trucks.

87
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:01,005
I'll go after her.

88
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:03,213
Get up there with the bikes, now!

89
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,380
Move! Move!

90
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:08,505
<i>Santiago? Santiago?</i>

91
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,963
<i>Santiago, where are you?</i>

92
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:14,546
Yes, Diego?

93
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:18,005
I don't know where I am.

94
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:21,005
But she escaped. I lost her.

95
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:24,880
- What were you doing there?
- Warning my brother.

96
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:25,796
Jesus.

97
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:27,713
You said it was going down at noon,

98
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,546
- and it's ten fucking thirty.
- It wasn't my bust.

99
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,046
- It was never my bust.
- He changed it.

100
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:33,963
- They took him?
- I don't know.

101
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,213
They took my brother,
and you have to get him out.

102
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,088
- Get him out?
- Yes.

103
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,963
You're lucky he's still alive.

104
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:41,963
But he won't be alive for very long.

105
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,671
You never should've let
your idiot brother get involved

106
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:45,588
with this shit.

107
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,296
What if I told you I know?

108
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,088
I know where Lorea is.

109
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,671
I know where the money is.

110
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:07,046
How long have you known?

111
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,338
Three months.

112
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:12,963
And why wouldn't you tell me that?

113
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,630
Because I'm just your informant, right?

114
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,546
That's all I am?

115
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,755
If you've got something to tell me,
right now is the time to do it.

116
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:25,921
I...

117
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:29,255
was given a promotion.

118
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,796
I deliver vans full of money...

119
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:34,921
to Lorea's house in the jungle.

120
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:36,880
That's where he keeps the money.

121
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,838
His house is a safe.

122
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:41,671
And just so you know,

123
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:46,046
Lorea pays Diego and all of those men
that hired you way too much money.

124
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,046
They've just been watching you
chase your tail.

125
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,171
But now, maybe,
you can actually do something.

126
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,380
Your government has put a lot of time,
money, and training into all of you,

127
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:23,921
and it does not want to lose
that investment.

128
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:26,380
Over the next few weeks,

129
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:30,838
you will be bombarded with offers
to take your skill set and use them

130
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,546
in the private sector.

131
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,505
I was suckered into the same thing.

132
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:39,255
That's what I'm here to say,

133
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,255
that I have never had a feeling
as pure or proud

134
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:48,171
as completing a mission
with our flag on my shoulder.

135
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,171
Stay where you belong.

136
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:53,005
Thank you.

137
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:01,713
Good luck.

138
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,005
How many times have you given that speech?

139
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,713
It'll be 173.

140
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,296
Still keeping count
of everything in your life?

141
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,213
Of course.

142
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,046
- It's still a good speech.
- Thank you.

143
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:17,588
How you been?

144
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,713
I'm okay. You?

145
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,255
Did you get my text?

146
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:24,421
Yeah.

147
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:29,755
So? What's your take?

148
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:32,296
Who else do you have?

149
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:33,588
I came to you first.

150
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,338
If you can get Redfly,

151
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,963
I'll do it.

152
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:45,880
Really?

153
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:48,296
Yeah.

154
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:50,796
Do you think he's up for it?

155
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:55,296
I just feel like we owe him.
Besides...

156
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:58,671
it's always a little harder
than you think it's gonna be, right?

157
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,755
Get the captain, I'm in.

158
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:10,838
So... this is three bedroom...
and one and a half baths.

159
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,421
Nice view out the back window here.

160
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:21,963
Gets good light.

161
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,213
Kitchen's right this way.

162
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:27,838
They're asking $120,000.

163
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:32,088
- I think there's some flexibility there.
- Yeah.

164
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:35,088
I don't think this is the one for us.
Thank you, though.

165
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,296
All right, thank you.

166
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,671
Hey, I'm lookin' for a condo.

167
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,838
I hear you're the guy to talk to.

168
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,671
- Sorry to track you down like this.
- Hey, man.

169
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:07,796
I called your office.

170
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,171
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

171
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:11,755
- You look great.
- Ah, yeah, right.

172
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,796
- No, you do.
- It's been a while, huh?

173
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Well, we didn't hear from you
for a couple of years.

174
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:18,046
We thought you might have gone full native
in the jungle.

175
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,463
Yeah, I know.

176
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:20,921
Sorry.

177
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:24,088
So, how are you?

178
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,755
Uh... I'm okay.

179
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,755
Yeah,
I heard about you and Molly.

180
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:31,338
Yeah. It happens.

181
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:34,505
So, I got a job for you.

182
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,963
Guaranteed 17 grand
for a week of consulting.

183
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:42,046
No action unless you want it.
It's just a recce.

184
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,963
I'm retired.

185
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,130
I know.

186
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:46,505
What is it?

187
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,046
We're gonna get Gabriel Martin Lorea.

188
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,880
Haven't you been trying
to do that for years?

189
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:53,755
Yes.
I could never find him, and I finally did.

190
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:55,838
I can't do it, man.

191
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,796
There's more of this shit
around now than ever.

192
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,921
Anthony was down here trying
to get me to go to Africa for a month,

193
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,255
- but I... I can't... I can't do it.
- I need you on this one.

194
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,796
- It's less than a week of work.
- I would love to.

195
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,838
God knows I could use the money,

196
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:09,046
but I'm supporting
two households right now.

197
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,005
There's potential
for significant upside on this.

198
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,213
Will you just take a look
at my work on it?

199
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,088
- Are you going to Benny's fight?
- Yeah.

200
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,463
I gotta pick up Tess. I'm late.
Molly's gonna kill me.

201
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,380
- Just ride with me, okay?
- All right.

202
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:29,880
Molly's still letting you
over here, even after the split?

203
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:32,338
Only in the garage.

204
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,380
I'm sorry.

205
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:38,046
Tess!

206
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,671
- Still drink?
- Oh, yeah.

207
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,588
Want a beer?

208
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:48,796
Ah, shit.

209
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,963
You sleeping with this woman?

210
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,755
The accountant, the bean counter
who gave you all the information.

211
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:11,755
I'm guessing she's hot.

212
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,421
What's that supposed to mean?

213
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:15,130
Oh, well, I just noticed, over the years,

214
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,463
your informants tend to be
very attractive women.

215
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:21,255
No, I'm not.

216
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:24,171
Why not?

217
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,713
It's a fucked-up enough
situation as it is.

218
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,796
Hey, babe.

219
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,213
Hey, Tess!

220
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,005
Santiago.

221
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,130
Wow, so grown up, man.

222
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,463
Oh, I don't know about that.

223
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:45,963
I made 17 grand my first year
in the service, man.

224
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:49,213
If you told me then I'd be passing that up
for a week's work...

225
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:54,296
Don't worry about her, she's 15.
She's not listening to a word we say.

226
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:57,213
Seventeen grand is just for the recce.

227
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:01,296
But if we decide to move forward,
this could be a whole lot more than that.

228
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,671
I've cut a deal
with the agency down there.

229
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,755
We keep 25% of anything we seize.

230
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,463
I've got estimates he's got
over $75 million in cash with him.

231
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,838
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

232
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,671
Let's say the money is there.
How do we get paid?

233
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:20,255
'Cause this shit is serious,
and it takes real planning.

234
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:21,380
And you know that.

235
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:22,880
I've got a lawyer in St. John's

236
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:25,880
who set up
an offshore shell security operation

237
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:29,296
that's ready to pay out a salary
and bonuses for the rest of our lives.

238
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,130
It'll just come in
like any other paycheck.

239
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:33,338
Will you take a look at my work on it?

240
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,546
No, I don't want to see that
because then I can't unsee it.

241
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,713
This operation is... illegal, right?

242
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:41,671
This is not illegal.

243
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:45,088
My company's under contract
to an agency of a foreign government.

244
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:48,796
And besides, even if it was illegal,
most of the live fire you've done's been

245
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,713
against the Geneva Convention,
technically, so...

246
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,880
Come on,
you're a better salesman than that.

247
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:55,546
This is a very different thing.

248
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,463
I'll be right back.

249
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,588
So you're trying to get him
to go back to work?

250
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:12,005
Maybe. Why?

251
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:15,755
No reason.

252
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:19,505
You think your mom would still let him go?

253
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:22,171
My mom? Of course.

254
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:26,005
<i>She's </i>not the problem.

255
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,546
He hasn't worked
since they forced him to retire.

256
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:32,338
Your dad's a good man.

257
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,463
You shouldn't be too hard on him.

258
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:52,088
So,
I guess you'll just keep selling condos,

259
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:55,255
and I'll run and gun
until my knees finally blow out.

260
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:57,921
Or you could do this without me.

261
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,713
I could. But I don't wanna,

262
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:03,463
'cause I say we deserve better, man.

263
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:07,588
How many times did we fly around
with 20 million bucks at our feet

264
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:10,921
to pay off some cockroach somewhere,
and we never took a dime?

265
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:14,838
- Hell, you've been shot four times.
- Five.

266
00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:18,046
You've been shot five times
for your country,

267
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,921
and you can't even afford a new truck.

268
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,296
That's the real crime.

269
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:24,046
- Good to see you, Tess.
- Good to see you.

270
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,505
- You coming back?
- Yeah, I'll be back in 20.

271
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:30,755
I gotta drop her off. Is Ironhead in?

272
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:33,088
Only if you are.

273
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:37,088
- Just take a look.
- Fine.

274
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:38,963
I'll take a look.
Leave my truck outta this.

275
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:40,255
This isn't about my truck.

276
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:42,713
Yes, it is.
That's exactly what this is about!

277
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,713
- Your mom will pick you up, okay?
- Yep.

278
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,755
Hey!

279
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:04,671
I love you.

280
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:08,421
I miss you.

281
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,796
- What'd he say?
- He's taking a look at it.

282
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,546
He may not be up for this.

283
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,796
You know he's the best
with something this complex.

284
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:39,046
And he needs this right now.

285
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,546
All right.

286
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:47,838
This shit is fuckin' depressing.

287
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,046
C'mon.

288
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,338
Let your brother have some fun.
Support him.

289
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,005
I've been supporting him
since the day he was born.

290
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:56,630
That kid's a one-in-a-million talent,

291
00:23:56,713 --> 00:24:00,296
going out there, playing the fucking clown
to a bunch of hillbillies.

292
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:02,296
Ah, yeah,

293
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,713
where are my corner men?

294
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:06,963
Holy shit, look who it is!

295
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:11,588
What's up, Benny?
Oh, holy shit!

296
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:13,505
Oh, God!

297
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:15,213
Hell of a night for you to show.

298
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:17,588
- It's great to see you, man.
- You as well.

299
00:24:17,671 --> 00:24:19,338
Hey! Every day you're uglier.

300
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:21,380
Ah, you little shithead.

301
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:22,630
Good to see you.

302
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,255
Did you boys get my text?

303
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,755
Yeah?

304
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:28,755
Fish?

305
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:31,130
I need a pilot.
I can't do this thing without you.

306
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,380
I don't know, man.
I got the new baby now,

307
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:38,463
and my lady isn't into me
doing this kinda shit anymore.

308
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:40,921
What... What does that mean?

309
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:44,588
Did you read the text? This can change you
and that baby's life forever.

310
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:48,630
What happened to that bullshit
about going back to your mother's homeland

311
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:51,046
and empowering the people
to police themselves?

312
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:55,213
Anyway, I lost my license.
I can't even fly right now.

313
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,005
Well, I don't need a pilot with a license.

314
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,755
I'm in with the army down there.
I just need a pilot I can trust.

315
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:02,171
Yeah, I don't think so.

316
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:07,005
Okay.
Lorea is destroying that country.

317
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,463
So we get to take out a very bad man,
and, oh, by the way,

318
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:13,421
there's a winning lottery ticket stuck
to the bottom of your cowboy boot.

319
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:17,171
Every guy in that gym would jump at this.

320
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:18,963
Come on, focus, guys! It's fight night.

321
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:20,963
Yeah, don't worry about that bullshit.

322
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:21,963
Sorry, Benny.

323
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:23,963
You ready for this?

324
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:26,588
Hell yeah.

325
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:27,838
Let's go.

326
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,505
- I didn't mean to call your shit bullshit.
- It's all right.

327
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:37,546
I got busted.

328
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
It's not a big deal.

329
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:42,380
Actually, it's a big deal.

330
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:44,921
Coke?

331
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,838
Jesus, Frankie.

332
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,713
Technically, it's a suspension.
I'm still under review.

333
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,588
Well, what about you?
What are you gonna do?

334
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,713
I said if Redfly's in, I'm in.

335
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:03,796
- Come on, stick with me here, guys.
- Oh, I'm with you, Benny.

336
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,171
But are you with me?

337
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,046
Are you in?

338
00:26:08,255 --> 00:26:09,130
You know I am.

339
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,088
I go where you go.

340
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:13,255
That's what I thought. Benny stands tall.

341
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,130
<i>From Red Feather Lakes, Colorado,</i>

342
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:20,046
<i>standing six foot three,
weighing in at 195 pounds,</i>

343
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,296
<i>I bring you... Ben Miller!</i>

344
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Go, Ben!

345
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:32,463
Come on!

346
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:39,338
Let's go, Benny!

347
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:41,088
Cheers, man.

348
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:44,713
Benny, take it easy! Nice and slow!

349
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:50,046
I took a look at your folder.
It's good work.

350
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,213
Thank you.

351
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:52,921
You need five guys and a pilot.

352
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:56,963
Yeah, Benny!

353
00:26:57,463 --> 00:26:59,838
Go! Get him, Benny!

354
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,005
What's up, brother?

355
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:09,838
The only thing missing is your entry plan.

356
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,630
I have a full set of bullshit passports
waiting for us.

357
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:17,796
We go through immigration
as power line consultants.

358
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,838
Once we're in-country,

359
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:21,713
they don't have
any facial recognition cameras yet, so...

360
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:22,838
we're ghosts.

361
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,171
So what's the verdict?

362
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:31,838
I'm in for the recce if you guys are.

363
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:35,588
- You sure?
- Yeah, just the recce though.

364
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:36,880
No live fire.

365
00:27:37,796 --> 00:27:39,046
- That's all right.
- Okay.

366
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:42,838
Fish?

367
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:44,713
When is it?

368
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,046
We leave Thursday.

369
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,588
Okay.

370
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:50,421
<i>And here we go!</i>

371
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:52,255
Come on, Benny! Let's go!

372
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,796
All right, it's time to work.

373
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,796
Come on, Benny!

374
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:25,713
Comms.

375
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:27,463
Pass those out.

376
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:35,713
We're in Lorea's backyard.

377
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:53,213
So what's this guy got against banks?
At least a safe.

378
00:29:54,546 --> 00:29:56,630
<i>The house is the safe.</i>

379
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,713
<i>I'm at the gate.</i>

380
00:30:03,213 --> 00:30:06,255
This looks like everything was done
about 82% right.

381
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,421
<i>They got all the toys out here,
but these cameras aren't even aimed</i>

382
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:10,796
<i>at the weakest breach point.</i>

383
00:30:11,463 --> 00:30:13,546
<i>Your girlfriend's making</i>
<i>her normal money drop?</i>

384
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,463
<i>Yeah.</i>

385
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,088
<i>She's prepared to record
the inside of the house.</i>

386
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:19,005
<i>Pope...</i>

387
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:22,130
<i>Pope, I have kids over here.
Does he have kids living in here with him?</i>

388
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,463
'Cause that's gonna make things
a whole lot more complicated

389
00:30:25,546 --> 00:30:27,588
and is not what I signed up for.

390
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:30,380
The family's not the problem.
They're the answer.

391
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:32,463
Why?

392
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:34,380
<i>Church.</i>

393
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:36,005
Lorea's very devout.

394
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:37,630
<i>Every Sunday morning,</i>

395
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,546
he sends three guards
to the 6:00 a.m. service.

396
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,213
When they get back,
he sends the rest of the team,

397
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:44,963
<i>along with his family, into town to mass.</i>

398
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,171
<i>That leaves him</i>

399
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:49,546
<i>and three guards in that house,
and that's our window.</i>

400
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,546
Why would he do that?

401
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,755
<i>Worried</i>
<i>about someone taking his kids.</i>

402
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:55,921
<i>And he never leaves his money.</i>

403
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,713
Also, I don't think he believes
anyone actually has the balls

404
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:00,088
to come out here and rob him.

405
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:02,588
It's probably 'cause it's a stupid idea.

406
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:08,588
<i>Pope,</i>
<i>I got your girlfriend coming up right now.</i>

407
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:11,046
Holy shit.

408
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,755
She is beautiful, man.

409
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,171
I fucking knew it.

410
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,755
Fuck off.

411
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:28,713
God damn.

412
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:36,046
I got an execution
about to go down over here.

413
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,588
Are you at the tennis courts?

414
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:38,505
<i>Yeah.</i>

415
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:39,796
Yeah, that's his spot.

416
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:42,755
<i>Perdóname, padre.</i>

417
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,130
<i>Why is she doing this?</i>

418
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:01,713
<i>She hopes I can get</i>
<i>her little brother out of jail.</i>

419
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,213
<i>Did you put him in jail?</i>

420
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:06,963
- <i>Not really.</i>
<i>- Buenas.</i>

421
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:10,380
<i> I'm guessing that's putting her</i>
<i>at some risk.</i>

422
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:13,380
<i>Man, I almost forgot</i>
<i>why I got out of this business.</i>

423
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,380
<i>Shit gets so dark so quick.</i>

424
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:20,963
Oh, shit,
we got ground sensors here, boys.

425
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:23,088
<i>Did you hit one?</i>

426
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,505
I don't know, I'm not sure.

427
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:41,255
Benny, I got two guys
on motorbikes coming your way.

428
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:44,671
<i>Hold tight, Benny.</i>
<i>I'm trying to get out there to cover you.</i>

429
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,255
Good afternoon, Mr. Lorea.

430
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,838
A stock boy job
at Walmart's starting

431
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,671
to look pretty good right now, boys.

432
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:11,130
It looks good to me.

433
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:12,213
Good.

434
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,130
Okay.

435
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,130
Thank you, sir.

436
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,921
I'm clear. They're coming back to you.

437
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:34,338
Let's get the fuck outta here.

438
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:41,130
You were gonna piss yourself.

439
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:43,338
I was getting onto the déjà vu part, man.

440
00:33:46,755 --> 00:33:48,088
So what's the plan?

441
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,796
Are their guys prepared to operate
across the border?

442
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:52,671
What's the scope of this thing?

443
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:54,713
Sunday soft hit is the way to do it.

444
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:57,380
Otherwise, you bring in an army,
you'd start a fucking war up there.

445
00:33:57,463 --> 00:34:01,130
Mm-hmm. So, when do you need
to present to the agency down here?

446
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:06,505
I'm not sure I wanna tell them.

447
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:07,880
Why?

448
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,963
We saw the place.

449
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:11,545
It's full of holes.

450
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:14,213
So maybe we don't tell them...

451
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,545
...and we do this thing ourselves.

452
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,505
What?

453
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:22,463
What?

454
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:24,545
Now, we each took 17 grand...

455
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,920
to help the narcotics unit map out
and plan this fuckin' thing.

456
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:31,338
I told you I wasn't even comfortable
helping them do it.

457
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,463
Now you want us to do it by ourselves?
Kill a bunch of fuckin' narcos?

458
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:37,588
If we hit that window, like you said,
when they're at church,

459
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:40,338
nobody but Lorea gets killed.

460
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,380
And I'm okay with that.

461
00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:46,088
Does the agency down here
even know about this?

462
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,005
- What do you mean?
- Come on, man!

463
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:49,170
Don't fuck around.

464
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,045
Who paid our fees?

465
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,755
It's complicated, technically...

466
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,338
you guys were paid through an LLC.

467
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:59,046
Mm, no, not that complicated.

468
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,171
It's $100,000.
Where the fuck did it come from?

469
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:09,546
I'll get the bill.

470
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:11,171
Thanks.

471
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:13,880
Great trip, boys.

472
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:16,671
It's turning out
to be some full-on cowboy shit.

473
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:27,005
Whose money is it, huh?

474
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,838
- It was my money.
- Jeez.

475
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:31,380
What were you thinking?

476
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,338
What?
Does that change anything?

477
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:34,838
Yeah, man.

478
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:37,255
You fucking lied to us.

479
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:39,213
No, I didn't lie to you.

480
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:41,005
I asked you guys to come down here,

481
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,171
do reconnaissance, and make a plan.

482
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,671
Now, we can execute that plan alone

483
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:48,338
and take all of the money,

484
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:52,588
or you guys can fuck off,
and I'll bring the team from down here in.

485
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:57,213
But I assure you, if I do that,
this fucker will find out about it,

486
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,713
and he'll be gone, and I need this guy.

487
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:02,505
You know how many fucking bad men
are out there all over the world?

488
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,546
Yeah, well, this is my last one.

489
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,171
And you may not believe it,

490
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,671
but I have been here
for the last three years of my life,

491
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:12,963
trying to make a difference,
but it's a fucking mess.

492
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,546
And it's all because of Lorea.

493
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:19,380
The thought of leaving everything
we've done behind for the last 17 years,

494
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:20,921
with nothing to show for it...

495
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:22,838
Fuck you, nothing to show for it.

496
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:24,630
Look, if...

497
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:26,921
If we had accomplished half the things
that we've accomplished

498
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:29,213
in any other profession,
we'd be set for life.

499
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,713
Hey, man, that's the deal we cut.

500
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:33,963
- Well, it's a shitty deal.
- Yeah, well...

501
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,088
Because this man's a goddamn hero,

502
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,255
and he can't even send his kids
to college.

503
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,880
And Fish's the most talented pilot I know,
and he's grounded on a bullshit coke rap.

504
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:45,713
And how many times can your brother
get the shit knocked out of him for...

505
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:47,880
I didn't get the shit beat out of me.
I won that fight.

506
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:48,796
Sorry, Benny.

507
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,796
And how many more pep talks
can you possibly give?

508
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:54,130
I'm done, man.

509
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,838
Both knees are shot.

510
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:58,588
That neck operation I got last year
made the whole thing worse.

511
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:01,255
So, the question is,

512
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:04,130
do we finally get to use our skills
for our own benefit

513
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:06,171
and actually change something?

514
00:37:19,463 --> 00:37:20,630
So, are we doing this?

515
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:22,713
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

516
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,630
This guy doesn't come through
with the one key piece of intel

517
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,005
we need to make this decision.

518
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:27,921
For all we know,

519
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:29,838
she could be setting us up
to get her brother back.

520
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:31,171
We'll know tomorrow.

521
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:34,296
She should have been recording
that whole thing today.

522
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:37,880
All right, if it does come back clean,

523
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,921
how would you do
the Sunday morning version?

524
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:45,546
- I haven't thought about it.
- Bullshit, you can't help yourself.

525
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:48,963
All right.

526
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,630
In the first pop, you'd have 40 minutes
to get in, get the job done,

527
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,755
and get out before the family
comes home from church.

528
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:54,713
That's a hard out.

529
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:56,463
We need to breach the fence,

530
00:37:56,546 --> 00:37:59,088
sweep the premises,
find and subdue the guards,

531
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:01,713
scrub the hard drives
in the security room,

532
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:06,213
get rid of Lorea, find the money,
pack the money into 18 hundred-pound bags,

533
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:08,755
and then hoof it half a mile
to the nearest vehicle.

534
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,255
There's only two ways out:

535
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:12,671
the fence in the front,
or over the mountain we came down,

536
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:13,880
and I'm too old for that.

537
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,546
We need to use one of their vans.

538
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,380
There were two vans in the courtyard.

539
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,421
But if the family uses those vans
to go to church, then we got nothing.

540
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:23,796
So we need another van.

541
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:27,380
- Can your girl work that out?
- I can ask her.

542
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:31,880
Still got your aviation guy down here?

543
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:35,421
'Cause we would need
a heavy-lift helicopter in 32 hours

544
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:37,671
to get us over the Andes and to the ocean.

545
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:39,921
I don't know, but I'll give him a call.

546
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:44,005
Oh, yeah! Big dog is back!

547
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:46,546
Redfly's gonna be rich, boys!

548
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:50,005
Now we're talkin'.

549
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,421
Hello.

550
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:09,713
<i>Hola.</i>

551
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:12,296
<i>¿Señor?</i>

552
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:15,463
Thank you. Have a good day.

553
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:30,755
- Thank you.
- That's it?

554
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:33,796
I don't know.

555
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,671
Miss, two coffees, please.

556
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:37,421
- My brother.
- Yeah.

557
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:40,463
I might need you to do one more thing
for me.

558
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,463
Can you get an extra van...

559
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:45,921
into the compound, Sunday morning?

560
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:49,005
If I did that,
they're going to know it's me.

561
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:52,755
And everyone who works for him
ends up dead, sooner or later.

562
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,005
If you can get me an extra van
in there Sunday morning...

563
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:01,088
I will get you and your brother
out of the country

564
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,880
with new papers and money.

565
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,255
How much?

566
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:10,171
Two million.

567
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,255
Two million?

568
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:13,505
Yes.

569
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,671
And you'll only have a couple hours
to get my brother?

570
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:17,505
I'll find a way.

571
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:22,338
But I need that van inside those gates.

572
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:30,005
Okay.

573
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,796
- Yeah?
- Yes. I'll get the van.

574
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,380
But if we're not gone forever
after you make your move, we are dead.

575
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:39,546
You'll be gone.

576
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:43,505
Yeah.

577
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:47,713
Thank you.

578
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:08,838
Hey, fellas.

579
00:41:11,796 --> 00:41:12,921
Take a look at this.

580
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,713
Jesus, Pope!

581
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:20,755
- What the hell were you planning here?
- Exactly this.

582
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:22,963
Every single gun, bullet,

583
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,255
and fucking toothpick here's been sourced
in-country.

584
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,921
The idea is to pin this
on a local rival gang.

585
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:33,088
Now, who was it
that didn't trust this lady?

586
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:37,880
'Cause not only is she going to get us
that extra van, but she got us this.

587
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:42,921
There's our man, Lorea.

588
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,755
And, oh!

589
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:46,963
Look at what's there behind him.

590
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,213
Looks like money to me.

591
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:52,088
- There's gotta be about 35 million there.
- We don't know that.

592
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:53,380
Whatever it is, it's a lot.

593
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:55,713
What are you gonna do
with your share, huh?

594
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:58,380
Never spend your money
until it's in your pocket, Benjamin.

595
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:00,921
Well, I'm just sayin',
I'm gonna get that Ferrari, man.

596
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:03,255
- How original.
- What about the bird?

597
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,005
Well, he said if we're there
with three million bucks, he'll be there.

598
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,713
So we got a bird, we got a van,

599
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:13,963
we got Lorea confirmed
in the house with the money.

600
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:20,463
All right, give me... give me a minute.

601
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:37,630
Uh, you know, if you had pulled this shit
when we were active duty,

602
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:39,213
I would have court-martialed your ass.

603
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:42,671
Look, why don't we all
just have a dinner tonight,

604
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:45,296
get drunk, on me,
and you all can go home in the morning?

605
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:47,963
Nah, fuck that.

606
00:42:48,796 --> 00:42:50,421
I can't.

607
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:52,046
Somehow, I just...

608
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:56,755
...ended up against it here. You know?

609
00:42:57,505 --> 00:43:00,130
I'm burning through my pension.
Molly's job doesn't cut it.

610
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,296
I can't sell condos
to save my fucking life.

611
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,046
The only thing I have
is taking care of these girls.

612
00:43:06,505 --> 00:43:07,380
Yeah.

613
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,380
Yeah, I understand that.

614
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,296
Fuck, I missed this.

615
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:18,421
It's like they take your best 20 years,
and then spit you out.

616
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,130
Yeah.

617
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:22,421
I just can't stop thinking
about the mistakes.

618
00:43:24,088 --> 00:43:26,880
- What mistakes?
- Fuck, man.

619
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:29,088
All of 'em.

620
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:33,130
- Didn't get better when you got out?
- No.

621
00:43:34,213 --> 00:43:37,130
Only thing that made it feel better
is when you put a gun in my hand.

622
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:40,630
So, I guess that's what we'll do.

623
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,255
<i>All right, first things first:</i>

624
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:55,171
<i>safety.</i>

625
00:43:56,005 --> 00:43:58,213
There is no medevac.
There is no ground support.

626
00:43:58,296 --> 00:44:00,755
Any injuries we sustain,
we're walking out with.

627
00:44:01,046 --> 00:44:03,630
Be mindful,
each of you has a medical kit in your bag.

628
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:05,380
Number two:

629
00:44:05,463 --> 00:44:07,921
you cannot go back
to your normal life after tonight.

630
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:12,046
Make no mistake about it.
What we are about to do is criminal.

631
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:16,005
We do not have the flag on our shoulders,
and no amount of bullshit

632
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,755
that we tell ourselves
is gonna change that.

633
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:19,796
If we do our job right,

634
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,713
we will be committing one murder
and one armed robbery.

635
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,171
You guys need to own the fact
that you are desecrating

636
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:26,963
most of the oaths you ever took.

637
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:29,963
Third:

638
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,255
family.

639
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,005
If they don't go to church,
or if they come home early,

640
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,755
it's an abort. Full stop.
They are not who we came for.

641
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,588
And lastly,

642
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:40,546
it's not too late to go home.

643
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:42,421
We had an agreement with Pope,

644
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,088
and we fulfilled that.

645
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:47,630
Any man here who wants to walk away now
can do so knowing they're the best of us.

646
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,088
But it's gotta be now.

647
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:56,796
I wanna make sure
we're not leaving that house

648
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,380
without taking care of Lorea.

649
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,546
If he's there like he's supposed to be,
we'll get him.

650
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,880
We leave at 0300.

651
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:06,838
Hooah.

652
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,380
<i>It's a good thing</i>
<i>these guys are so devout.</i>

653
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:18,505
Our dad used to say,

654
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:21,088
"When it's raining, it means
God didn't need us in church today."

655
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:25,380
He also said you go to heaven
for the climate and hell for the company.

656
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
<i>Actually, I think Mark Twain said that.</i>

657
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:30,338
All right, keep the radio clear,
let's stay awake here.

658
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,088
<i>How many is that getting in? Count it.</i>

659
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:36,380
Seven getting in the van.

660
00:45:37,255 --> 00:45:38,630
<i>Anybody see Lorea?</i>

661
00:45:39,255 --> 00:45:41,213
Negative. We never saw him come out.

662
00:45:41,796 --> 00:45:44,796
The wife and two kids are in
with a single driver.

663
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:47,296
<i>The family's left the building.</i>

664
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:50,588
<i>Repeat, family are all clear.</i>

665
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:54,463
All right, let's get ready here.

666
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:00,921
Damn, Pope, this lady is a keeper.

667
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:03,255
Punctual, smart, and brave as shit.

668
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:12,713
- Good day.
- What's this?

669
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:16,338
I'm here to drop off this van,
and then my brother is taking me home.

670
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:18,796
That idiot didn't tell me.

671
00:46:28,588 --> 00:46:30,213
She's in. She's in.

672
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:31,463
<i>Here we go.</i>

673
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:33,505
<i>Ben, you're first hit.
Call when it's secure.</i>

674
00:46:33,755 --> 00:46:36,171
<i>With this rain,
the guards are gonna be inside.</i>

675
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:37,671
<i>Roger.</i>

676
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,796
- <i>All clear, she's gone.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Copy.</i>

677
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,921
<i>All right, we're going in.</i>

678
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:43,838
<i>Front gate secure.</i>

679
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,505
One guard secured in the kitchen.

680
00:48:46,963 --> 00:48:49,546
- <i>Ben, come to the house.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Roger.</i>

681
00:49:01,713 --> 00:49:03,296
<i>I'm at the front door.</i>

682
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,505
Hold, Benny. Hold.

683
00:49:05,588 --> 00:49:07,130
<i>Threat in the TV room.</i>

684
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:09,213
We're gonna go around the side.

685
00:49:16,296 --> 00:49:17,755
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

686
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:20,005
All clear, Benny.
Eyes out for Lorea.

687
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:21,588
He sure as fuck heard us now.

688
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:22,546
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

689
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,755
Setting charges to the security room.

690
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:33,213
<i>What was that?</i>

691
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:34,671
We had to shoot the second guard
in the leg.

692
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:37,630
- They're taking him to the kitchen.
<i>- Coming down.</i>

693
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:38,588
Come on.

694
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:03,755
<i>Fuse is burning.</i>

695
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:35,046
<i>Any trace of him?</i>

696
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:38,380
<i>She said he never leaves.</i>

697
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,963
We got nothing. This guy's a ghost.

698
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,630
<i>Everyone to the office, right now.</i>

699
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:15,921
What the fuck?

700
00:51:19,255 --> 00:51:20,088
And Lorea?

701
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:22,505
Nothing. A couple of bags.

702
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,546
He's gone.

703
00:51:26,546 --> 00:51:27,588
With the money.

704
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,880
Your girl gave us up, Pope.

705
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,213
We gotta get the fuck outta here.

706
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,713
No, no, no, no, no, no.

707
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:50,588
What's that smell like to you?

708
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:53,921
Like a serious fuck-up.

709
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:56,505
No.

710
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,171
Paint.

711
00:52:06,338 --> 00:52:07,463
The house is the safe.

712
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,588
The house is the fucking safe.

713
00:52:40,463 --> 00:52:42,005
Benny, help me move this.
Come on.

714
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,755
- I'll take the edge.
- Over there.

715
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:45,963
Go, come on. Come on, man. Come on!

716
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,088
- Holy shit!
- Come on.

717
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:50,755
Go. Move, move.

718
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:52,421
C'mon.

719
00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:54,380
- Oh, my God!
- Fish, I'm up.

720
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:57,130
Come on, guys!

721
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,963
Holy shit!

722
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,880
What'd I tell you, boys?

723
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:05,380
Jesus Christ!

724
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:09,338
Fucking God! Look at it!

725
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:11,630
- It goes all the way up!
- Let's go!

726
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,796
We're gonna need some bags.

727
00:53:21,005 --> 00:53:24,463
- I'll get another bag!
- Keep it coming.

728
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:28,171
What's wrong?

729
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:31,255
If the money's still here,
it means he's still here.

730
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:32,380
He's gone, man.

731
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:34,171
We got more!

732
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:35,463
Back wall, too.

733
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,921
Just concentrate.

734
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,630
Oh, we're just gettin' rich!

735
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,505
How much time we got?

736
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,713
Eight minutes.

737
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:45,088
Millers, enough of that over there.

738
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:46,838
We gotta start getting this shit
to the van.

739
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,005
Yeah, we got this.

740
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,380
- Come on, bro.
- Keep your eyes open.

741
00:53:52,505 --> 00:53:56,755
Yeah, bitches!

742
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,796
Here, take these.
I'm gonna go get the van.

743
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,005
- Meet me there.
- Yes, sir.

744
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:05,046
Careful.

745
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,296
Classic.

746
00:54:31,296 --> 00:54:32,546
Jesus Christ.

747
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,421
- Help us, man!
- Come on! Come on!

748
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:38,046
Come on. Over there.

749
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:43,755
Holy shit!

750
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,755
We're gonna need more bags.
See if you can find something.

751
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:01,755
On it.

752
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:04,713
I tell you one thing, man,

753
00:55:04,796 --> 00:55:06,505
you can tell your girls
they can stop studying

754
00:55:06,588 --> 00:55:08,838
'cause Daddy's just gonna buy their way
into Harvard!

755
00:55:10,296 --> 00:55:13,088
Holy shit,
this is a fuckload of money!

756
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:15,463
Grab some of those and go.

757
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:16,963
How are we on time?

758
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:18,546
We got time for a couple more loads.

759
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,130
- You sure?
- Grab those and bring 'em down.

760
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,463
Guys!

761
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,005
I got another wall over here!

762
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,838
- Holy shit!
- Shit!

763
00:55:27,671 --> 00:55:28,546
It's everywhere.

764
00:55:28,713 --> 00:55:30,338
Well, fuck me!

765
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,755
It's the whole fucking house.

766
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:38,880
What's up?

767
00:55:38,963 --> 00:55:40,421
The van's full, man!

768
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,796
It's all good. We gotta go.

769
00:55:46,463 --> 00:55:47,671
What the hell are you doing?

770
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:50,088
Stop digging more out.
We got all this to deal with.

771
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:51,255
A couple more loads.

772
00:55:55,463 --> 00:55:58,755
You know, in the ten years
I've been working with you, Tom,

773
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:00,921
you have never missed a hard out!

774
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:04,380
I gave us a 15-minute cushion.

775
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,463
It's 12 minutes to the church,
a 40-minute service, 12 minutes back.

776
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:10,921
Add 5 minutes
to load in and out of the van,

777
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,796
and we can subtract 7 to beat them
to the exit route.

778
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,755
We will be fine!

779
00:56:14,463 --> 00:56:17,296
All right?
God damn it, look at all this money!

780
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:19,421
Just a couple more loads!

781
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:22,671
Fuck this!

782
00:56:26,588 --> 00:56:28,130
Time's up. We gotta go.

783
00:56:28,921 --> 00:56:31,130
I want one more sweep for Lorea.

784
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:33,755
All right?

785
00:56:36,421 --> 00:56:37,880
And then we burn it all down.

786
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,755
Okay,

787
00:56:46,463 --> 00:56:48,171
I'll get these last one loaded down there,

788
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,630
and you call out when you're ready
to light it up.

789
00:56:55,213 --> 00:56:57,380
Move. Move!

790
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:34,046
Come on, we gotta go!

791
00:57:35,463 --> 00:57:36,838
Lighting it up.

792
00:57:49,755 --> 00:57:51,171
What are we shooting at in here?

793
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,171
Is that Lorea?

794
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:00,130
He's dead.

795
00:58:01,463 --> 00:58:02,296
Good.

796
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,921
I'm hit.

797
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,380
Shit!

798
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:10,671
- Take it easy.
- Where?

799
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,296
Left side.

800
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:14,755
Did it go through?

801
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:16,130
Yeah, it went through.

802
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:17,463
- I'll be fine.
- It'll be okay.

803
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:19,630
- Get the clot kit.
- Straight through.

804
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:20,838
You'll be okay.

805
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:22,171
You'll be all right.

806
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:23,088
Just breathe.

807
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,505
I'm okay.

808
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,838
All right. Let go.

809
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:33,046
- Told you this was a stupid idea.
- Yeah, you sure did.

810
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,338
Sunday school's over, boys.

811
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,796
They're back.

812
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:41,921
Oh, shit!

813
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:46,838
- The family?
- No, the first shift of guards.

814
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:48,380
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

815
00:58:48,463 --> 00:58:49,588
You gonna be able to move?

816
00:58:49,671 --> 00:58:50,963
- We don't got a stretcher.
- Yeah.

817
00:58:51,255 --> 00:58:53,046
Just help me get my kit back on.

818
00:58:56,588 --> 00:58:58,463
All right, we can each take
a backpack of cash,

819
00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:02,005
we go out through the back
into the jungle, and we're gone.

820
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:04,838
- I'll cover the cost of the operation.
- Fuck that.

821
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:08,338
No.We are bringing Ironhead home safe.

822
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,088
Not dragging him through the jungle.

823
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,421
And we're not leaving them
any of this fucking money.

824
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:15,213
Right, so we burn it all down and go.

825
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:18,130
There's about $100 million
for them waiting in the van out there.

826
00:59:18,213 --> 00:59:19,796
We need to hunt and shoot quickly.

827
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:22,505
Call out your kills.
I don't want any fuckin' surprises.

828
00:59:22,588 --> 00:59:24,796
- Got it?
- All right.

829
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,213
Let's do this.

830
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:29,380
You two go that way,
we'll come down the front.

831
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:31,046
I'm all right.

832
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,588
Let's just do it.

833
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:34,463
All right.

834
00:59:35,796 --> 00:59:36,630
All right.

835
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,171
Let's go.

836
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:49,588
<i>Here we go, fellas.</i>

837
01:00:01,088 --> 01:00:03,171
<i>That's two down in the front hall.</i>

838
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,130
<i>That's three.</i>

839
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:14,255
<i>That's four.</i>

840
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:15,671
<i>Get back to the gate.</i>

841
01:00:15,755 --> 01:00:17,838
<i>I'm sure they dropped
a few guys out there.</i>

842
01:00:17,921 --> 01:00:18,796
On the way.

843
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:54,671
<i>Anybody got eyes</i>
<i>on that SUV the guards came in?</i>

844
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:56,296
<i>Because we're gonna need it.</i>

845
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,755
<i>I'm already loading it up.</i>

846
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:01,796
<i>Is everybody out of there?</i>

847
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,671
- <i>Coast's clear.</i>
<i>- </i><i>All clear.</i>

848
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:15,505
<i>Another van of guys</i>
<i>just passed me in the driveway.</i>

849
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:34,005
Catfish is coming around
with the van.

850
01:01:37,171 --> 01:01:39,171
What are you doing?
Come on! Let's go!

851
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,463
Benny! Hey!

852
01:02:07,796 --> 01:02:09,380
Let's go, man! Hustle!

853
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,713
Fuck!

854
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:15,546
Fuck!

855
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:24,005
Fuck!

856
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:26,213
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

857
01:02:26,296 --> 01:02:29,338
That was a shit job back there, man.
We don't leave messes like that!

858
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:35,296
<i>What do we do up here?</i>
<i>I've got the family waiting to go in.</i>

859
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:38,046
<i>Take it slow.</i>

860
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,338
Your girlfriend's here.

861
01:03:28,546 --> 01:03:30,338
- Did you get out okay?
- Yes.

862
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:32,588
We're almost there. Help me.

863
01:03:33,046 --> 01:03:33,880
<i>Vamos.</i>

864
01:03:34,963 --> 01:03:36,880
Just load 'em up, and I'll weigh 'em.

865
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,588
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.

866
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,130
What the fuck we gonna do with that thing?

867
01:04:10,088 --> 01:04:10,963
William.

868
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:14,713
<i>- Habibi.</i>
<i>- Kaifa halak?</i>

869
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:17,046
- You made it.
- Count on me.

870
01:04:17,213 --> 01:04:18,046
Mosquito bite?

871
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:20,088
Yeah, a little one.

872
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:22,130
Feels worse than it looks.

873
01:04:24,171 --> 01:04:26,171
Now how the hell are we all gonna fit
in that?

874
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:29,505
- Come when you're ready.
<i>- Copy.</i>

875
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:32,005
Feel free to count it.

876
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:33,505
I know where to find you.

877
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,505
Voilà!

878
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:02,296
It won't all fit in the net!

879
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,380
We gotta get the rest on it inside!

880
01:05:13,755 --> 01:05:15,421
I don't know if that scale's fucked up,

881
01:05:15,505 --> 01:05:18,088
but he's telling me
we got 6,000 pounds here.

882
01:05:18,171 --> 01:05:20,755
That's $250 million.

883
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:22,671
We stole 250 million?

884
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:25,213
I'm definitely getting that Ferrari!

885
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,255
- Are you sure?
- Let's go!

886
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:29,005
If that scale is even close
to being right,

887
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:30,463
we're gonna have a weight issue.

888
01:05:30,546 --> 01:05:33,630
What's the issue?
This helo can carry 9,000 pounds.

889
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:37,505
That's 9,000 at 2,000 feet.

890
01:05:37,588 --> 01:05:41,380
If we want to get to the ocean,
we gotta fly over the fucking Andes, man.

891
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,838
Are we really leaving $200 million
on the fucking runway?

892
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:51,046
Okay, she'll make it. Let's go!

893
01:05:52,546 --> 01:05:55,380
What's your plan for her?
We're already overweight as it is.

894
01:05:56,046 --> 01:05:58,755
We promised them a ride
over the border into Peru.

895
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:01,130
And we're gonna stand by that!

896
01:07:05,213 --> 01:07:08,630
Okay, we're gonna let you go now.

897
01:07:08,713 --> 01:07:09,630
Thank you.

898
01:07:09,713 --> 01:07:11,380
I just need to know something.

899
01:07:11,963 --> 01:07:13,130
What's my name?

900
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:15,463
I... I don't know.

901
01:07:15,546 --> 01:07:17,963
What about your buddy back there?
What's his name?

902
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:20,171
I don't know.

903
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,171
He said he couldn't tell me.

904
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:26,630
Okay, I want you to be real careful...
about what you're about to say

905
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:30,713
because the only thing
that ties us to them is you.

906
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,921
Now, when you finally had sex,

907
01:07:37,005 --> 01:07:40,088
and you rolled over and looked him
in the eye and said,

908
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:42,796
"What's your real name?"
What did he say?

909
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,088
That never happened.

910
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,963
I can just go ask him.

911
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:48,338
He never told me where he was from.

912
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:50,671
He said that you served together...

913
01:07:52,296 --> 01:07:53,546
and that you were honest.

914
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,213
Why'd he say that?

915
01:07:56,838 --> 01:07:58,171
Because I asked him if...

916
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:02,005
if he wasn't afraid of you cheating him.

917
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:03,755
That's why.

918
01:08:04,588 --> 01:08:05,838
Everything all right?

919
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,213
No!

920
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:15,755
Here's three million dollars.

921
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:20,255
And two tickets
with visas to Sydney, Australia.

922
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:25,587
On the way to the airport,
stop at this shipping company.

923
01:08:26,296 --> 01:08:29,712
Make sure to send the boxes
to this hotel in Sydney.

924
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:34,046
You know that's a lot more
than 75 million dollars in there.

925
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,046
What does that mean?

926
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,212
It's not just Lorea's money in there.

927
01:08:40,046 --> 01:08:42,130
A lot more people
are gonna come looking after you.

928
01:08:42,712 --> 01:08:47,296
I can deal with that.
But do not stay in South America

929
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,421
because they will find you
and they will kill you.

930
01:08:51,087 --> 01:08:53,005
Promise me that you won't stay here.

931
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:53,962
- Yes!
- Promise me!

932
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,130
I promise you.

933
01:08:56,005 --> 01:08:58,462
How... How do I contact you?

934
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:00,005
You can't.

935
01:09:03,296 --> 01:09:05,505
You did everything right.

936
01:09:06,212 --> 01:09:07,546
You deserve this.

937
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:12,671
Take care of yourselves.

938
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:14,046
Thank you.

939
01:09:14,837 --> 01:09:15,712
Go!

940
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:39,755
She's lying.

941
01:09:41,546 --> 01:09:42,546
No, she's not.

942
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,755
There are consequences to this shit.

943
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,296
You know what we should have done?

944
01:09:54,505 --> 01:09:56,463
That's one you wouldn't come back from.

945
01:10:10,755 --> 01:10:12,338
<i>The weight drags</i>
<i>at higher altitudes.</i>

946
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:15,130
<i>I'd like to stay under 5,000 feet
till we hit the Andes.</i>

947
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:17,338
Ocean in four hours.

948
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,088
Roger that. Nice work.

949
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:34,088
I'm gonna try
between these two bigger peaks.

950
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:36,296
Find this valley I saw on the map.

951
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,380
Roger.

952
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:09,421
Just one last push
through the Andes.

953
01:11:14,338 --> 01:11:16,088
<i>How high do you think that is?</i>

954
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:19,046
<i>It's gotta be 11,000. Can't fly that high.</i>

955
01:11:19,838 --> 01:11:22,921
<i>Shouldn't have to.</i>
<i>Head for that lower ridge.</i>

956
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,213
How are we doing up here, boys?

957
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:29,421
Can we make it over?

958
01:11:30,171 --> 01:11:31,046
I don't know.

959
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:33,505
What the fuck is going on up here?

960
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:34,421
Go for it.

961
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:40,630
All right, baby. All right, baby.

962
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,588
Come on, now.

963
01:11:46,005 --> 01:11:47,963
All right, baby.

964
01:11:48,046 --> 01:11:50,296
- We're redlining, man.
- It's close, though.

965
01:11:56,171 --> 01:11:57,921
It's too much weight.
It's too much fucking weight.

966
01:11:58,713 --> 01:12:00,171
<i>We're never gonna make it.</i>

967
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:03,296
- What does that mean?
- It means we're losing fucking money.

968
01:12:03,755 --> 01:12:05,838
You wanna leave $50 million
in the middle of the jungle?

969
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,380
Do you wanna get to the ocean?

970
01:12:07,963 --> 01:12:09,588
All right, go do it.

971
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:13,713
I got it!

972
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:40,088
All right, let me check.

973
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,338
How's she feeling now?

974
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:53,755
That's feeling better.

975
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:56,463
Come on. Come on.

976
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,671
Come on.

977
01:13:22,296 --> 01:13:24,213
What the fuck are you doing, Catfish?

978
01:13:24,296 --> 01:13:26,088
One of the gearboxes is blown.

979
01:13:26,421 --> 01:13:27,338
What?

980
01:13:27,713 --> 01:13:29,338
I don't want to go into a spin.

981
01:13:37,421 --> 01:13:39,296
Okay, we might be in trouble here.

982
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,796
<i>I'm losing altitude.</i>

983
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:48,796
Ah, we should land. We should land now.

984
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,755
Crash-land here, and we all die.

985
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:53,130
I'm trying to get her back to flat.

986
01:13:53,213 --> 01:13:55,005
Roger. Prepare for a hard landing!

987
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:01,421
<i>There should be a farmer's field</i>
<i>on the other side of that ridge.</i>

988
01:14:02,088 --> 01:14:04,755
<i>- We passed it on the way up.</i>
<i>- I remember it.</i>

989
01:14:10,838 --> 01:14:12,921
<i>I can't land this with that bag under us.</i>

990
01:14:13,005 --> 01:14:15,005
We should lose the money,
maybe we don't die.

991
01:14:15,838 --> 01:14:18,921
Lose the money, or we're all gonna die!

992
01:14:19,005 --> 01:14:22,171
<i>Hit the external load release.
It's on the wall!</i>

993
01:14:22,963 --> 01:14:24,505
Pull the lever, Ben!

994
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,421
It didn't work!

995
01:14:35,296 --> 01:14:37,046
<i>There should be a manual override</i>

996
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:38,088
<i>on the cargo hook.</i>

997
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,963
Let me through!

998
01:14:59,713 --> 01:15:01,671
Benny!

999
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:05,213
All right, I'm gonna try to land here.

1000
01:15:10,588 --> 01:15:11,838
I gotta jump!

1001
01:15:15,463 --> 01:15:17,588
Benny!

1002
01:15:22,963 --> 01:15:23,963
Bad landing.

1003
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:54,755
Fish! Fish!

1004
01:15:56,713 --> 01:15:59,546
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so. I think so.

1005
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:01,296
Yo, Benny!

1006
01:16:02,005 --> 01:16:03,130
Benny!

1007
01:16:03,213 --> 01:16:05,713
- I'm here!
- Come on, we gotta move.

1008
01:16:06,505 --> 01:16:07,963
Come on!

1009
01:16:09,255 --> 01:16:11,338
Let's get our shit outta here.

1010
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:12,796
Try and get up to it.

1011
01:16:13,213 --> 01:16:15,630
- Fish!
- I need oxygen.

1012
01:16:17,713 --> 01:16:20,046
Everybody okay?

1013
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:21,171
Yeah.

1014
01:16:25,963 --> 01:16:27,671
Whoa, whoa!

1015
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:31,880
- They're into the fucking net.
- What's the plan here?

1016
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:34,505
We're gonna get that money
over that mountain to the ocean.

1017
01:16:34,588 --> 01:16:37,296
Benny, cover us
from under that tree line there.

1018
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:40,546
Fish, you take position up there.

1019
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,296
That's cocaine they're growing,
so they may have weapons trained on us

1020
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:44,671
from those buildings right there.

1021
01:16:45,046 --> 01:16:46,463
We got working radios?

1022
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:48,713
- No, comms are dead.
- Go with hand signals.

1023
01:16:48,921 --> 01:16:51,713
Pope and I will get out there
and look as peaceful as we can.

1024
01:16:53,713 --> 01:16:55,838
We'll give you a hand signal
when we think it's secure.

1025
01:16:56,421 --> 01:16:57,588
- Let's move.
- Benny.

1026
01:17:17,255 --> 01:17:19,755
Please step back. Sirs!

1027
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:22,171
Step back, please, that is not yours.

1028
01:17:22,255 --> 01:17:23,213
Who are you?

1029
01:17:23,713 --> 01:17:24,838
Who are you with?

1030
01:17:25,588 --> 01:17:26,838
We're with the army.

1031
01:17:27,213 --> 01:17:28,296
We are advisers.

1032
01:17:28,963 --> 01:17:31,546
You should call a rescue helicopter.

1033
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:33,338
- It's coming.
- Yes.

1034
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:36,088
In the meantime,
you are alone and don't have any uniforms.

1035
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,796
Okay, that can be resolved.

1036
01:17:40,171 --> 01:17:43,005
But what about the other passengers
from the accident?

1037
01:17:43,463 --> 01:17:44,380
We can talk about that.

1038
01:17:44,463 --> 01:17:47,338
But tell your people
to stop stealing our property.

1039
01:17:48,255 --> 01:17:49,796
These are our lands.

1040
01:17:50,255 --> 01:17:51,130
You fucked up, DEA.

1041
01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:53,421
No, no, no. Calm down. Calm down.

1042
01:17:53,713 --> 01:17:55,588
Sir, careful with that weapon.

1043
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:58,713
- We're not DEA. We're not DEA.
- We are calm.

1044
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:02,296
- Tell your guy to put his gun down.
- Stay calm. Stop.

1045
01:18:04,296 --> 01:18:06,505
Pope, what's he reaching for?
A weapon?

1046
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:10,213
Pope, do you cop...

1047
01:18:11,838 --> 01:18:14,505
Stay right there. Don't get any closer.

1048
01:18:22,796 --> 01:18:24,838
Fuck! What the hell, man?

1049
01:18:25,546 --> 01:18:26,671
No!

1050
01:18:27,796 --> 01:18:30,755
- Assholes! Murderers!
- Get out of there!

1051
01:18:30,838 --> 01:18:33,088
Get away from the money!
Get away from there!

1052
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:35,546
- Fuck!
- No!

1053
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:38,921
We need horses or mules,
please, and then we will get out of here.

1054
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,588
Benny, get these people
back up toward the village.

1055
01:18:41,671 --> 01:18:44,005
Fish, get this money on some mules.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1056
01:18:44,088 --> 01:18:46,005
Get back!

1057
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:49,130
Get up!

1058
01:18:52,088 --> 01:18:54,213
Get up! Get up, lady!

1059
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:03,296
Send me to God.

1060
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:15,671
Go! Keep going!

1061
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:18,921
Fuck.

1062
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:40,005
All right, let's get these donkeys
saddled up, get the bags on 'em.

1063
01:19:40,088 --> 01:19:41,255
Where's Pope?

1064
01:19:41,338 --> 01:19:42,255
He's up there.

1065
01:20:30,546 --> 01:20:32,296
That is for the mules.

1066
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:39,213
That is for the families.

1067
01:20:51,921 --> 01:20:53,005
That is for you.

1068
01:20:55,713 --> 01:20:56,838
Are we in agreement?

1069
01:21:05,005 --> 01:21:06,130
Good.

1070
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:08,921
We're very sorry for what happened.

1071
01:21:12,713 --> 01:21:14,921
And we very much appreciate
your cooperation.

1072
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,713
Come on.

1073
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,713
Sorry, kid.

1074
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:07,255
Those men have paid their debt!

1075
01:22:07,671 --> 01:22:09,130
Let them pass.

1076
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,130
Did you pay for the damage?

1077
01:22:51,046 --> 01:22:52,088
Yeah.

1078
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:54,213
How much?

1079
01:22:55,005 --> 01:22:57,963
Two hundred for the animals.
A million for the families.

1080
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,796
Which one of you shot first?

1081
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:11,255
I don't know.

1082
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,088
We need to watch ourselves here.

1083
01:23:19,546 --> 01:23:20,505
Yeah, we do.

1084
01:23:21,255 --> 01:23:22,838
What the hell does that mean?

1085
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:25,796
Nothin'.

1086
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:29,838
It just means we gotta watch ourselves,
that's all.

1087
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:31,213
Roger that.

1088
01:23:47,796 --> 01:23:48,963
How far have we gone?

1089
01:23:50,546 --> 01:23:52,130
We've gone about 12 clicks.

1090
01:23:53,213 --> 01:23:56,338
To get to the boat,
it's another day and a half, maybe two.

1091
01:23:56,796 --> 01:23:58,630
Well, a fire would be righteous.

1092
01:23:59,005 --> 01:24:00,880
Lorea's guys will be on our tail.

1093
01:24:01,088 --> 01:24:03,588
Smoke from a fire will give us away.
We cold camp.

1094
01:24:08,796 --> 01:24:10,796
Well, we're dancing with the devil now.

1095
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,921
Dancing?

1096
01:24:13,546 --> 01:24:15,838
We were dancing when we got on the plane
to come down here.

1097
01:24:15,921 --> 01:24:18,213
I would call this full intercourse.

1098
01:24:23,546 --> 01:24:25,046
How you doing, bud?

1099
01:24:26,088 --> 01:24:27,463
Golden.

1100
01:24:28,921 --> 01:24:29,796
Here.

1101
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,796
You're a good man, Benny.

1102
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:38,505
We're a dyin' breed, boys.

1103
01:24:41,546 --> 01:24:42,755
No, we're not.

1104
01:24:43,255 --> 01:24:46,671
The world's always going to need somebody
to go door-to-door to hold the line.

1105
01:24:47,755 --> 01:24:49,921
Cops go door-to-door and hold the line.

1106
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:53,463
We were warriors.

1107
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:57,963
Well,
it's hard to remember that sometimes.

1108
01:24:59,963 --> 01:25:01,005
Yeah, it is.

1109
01:25:03,213 --> 01:25:04,588
What are you talking about?

1110
01:25:06,338 --> 01:25:08,838
I was too quick on the trigger.
You know it, and I know it.

1111
01:25:12,963 --> 01:25:14,171
I killed those people.

1112
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:17,505
No, you didn't.

1113
01:25:20,338 --> 01:25:21,338
We all did.

1114
01:26:42,255 --> 01:26:44,796
This is definitely
the old smuggler's trail!

1115
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:49,005
We should just keep following it
all the way up.

1116
01:26:51,338 --> 01:26:52,338
Come on.

1117
01:26:56,755 --> 01:26:58,588
Stop pushing on me, man.
It's steep here.

1118
01:26:58,921 --> 01:27:02,046
Obviously, man,
we're on the side of a fucking mountain!

1119
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,255
Just shut up and concentrate!
Jesus Christ!

1120
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:07,338
- Come on, just go.
- Fuck you.

1121
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:09,421
Oh, really?

1122
01:27:09,505 --> 01:27:10,505
Keep going!

1123
01:27:10,588 --> 01:27:12,130
- Stop.
- You wanna do this?

1124
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:15,380
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1125
01:27:28,338 --> 01:27:29,296
Oh, fuck!

1126
01:27:32,255 --> 01:27:35,546
What the fuck are you laughing at?

1127
01:27:36,671 --> 01:27:38,213
That was a living animal, man.

1128
01:27:38,588 --> 01:27:42,046
It could have been any one of us.
You're worried about the fucking donkey?

1129
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:44,088
You need to get your shit straight here,
man.

1130
01:27:44,338 --> 01:27:46,088
- What? Me?
- Yeah, you.

1131
01:27:46,171 --> 01:27:47,171
You're pointing fingers at me?

1132
01:27:47,255 --> 01:27:49,755
- You're the reason we're in this mess.
- Oh, how the fuck is that?

1133
01:27:49,838 --> 01:27:52,671
Yeah, you had to grab every dollar
you could get your hands on, didn't you?

1134
01:27:52,755 --> 01:27:55,463
You could have gotten Lorea
two months ago! We didn't need to be here.

1135
01:27:55,546 --> 01:27:56,380
All right.

1136
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:57,963
Fucking bullshit!

1137
01:27:58,046 --> 01:27:59,630
We're all on the hook, are we not?

1138
01:27:59,713 --> 01:28:01,921
God damn this fucking horse!
Stop it!

1139
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,130
- Yes. It's fine.
- Relax. Relax.

1140
01:28:05,796 --> 01:28:08,255
We're not picking at the fucking scab
right now, okay?

1141
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,713
One foot in front of the other.

1142
01:28:10,796 --> 01:28:11,838
All right? Come on.

1143
01:28:12,171 --> 01:28:14,005
Let's go. Jesus fucking Christ.

1144
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:41,588
Oh, come on.

1145
01:28:44,838 --> 01:28:47,296
Are you sure you want me
to get rid of the mules?

1146
01:28:47,463 --> 01:28:51,338
This rock side's 20-foot deep.
We're not getting the mules through.

1147
01:28:55,005 --> 01:28:56,880
Yeah, it's on us now!

1148
01:28:58,963 --> 01:29:01,755
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1149
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:07,296
Look at the mules.

1150
01:29:09,255 --> 01:29:11,296
Well, if we can get over this,

1151
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,630
it should be all downhill
to the ocean from here.

1152
01:29:23,296 --> 01:29:24,963
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1153
01:29:32,171 --> 01:29:34,255
All right, come on up!

1154
01:29:36,588 --> 01:29:38,171
- Nice work.
- You, too.

1155
01:29:41,505 --> 01:29:43,505
Look, I talked a lot of shit back there.

1156
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:44,755
I didn't mean that.

1157
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,630
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no, it's...

1158
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,338
This is on me.

1159
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:53,046
- It's... all on me.
- No, man, it's...

1160
01:29:54,338 --> 01:29:55,588
I'm on the hook for this.

1161
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:58,921
You know? It is what it is.

1162
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,546
Yeah, it is what it is.

1163
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,296
I <i>am </i>a bit of a dick, though.

1164
01:30:29,088 --> 01:30:31,588
You could freeze an Eskimo's asshole
out here.

1165
01:30:33,046 --> 01:30:34,255
I demand a fire.

1166
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:38,046
We cold camp.

1167
01:30:54,005 --> 01:30:55,005
Fuck you.

1168
01:30:56,713 --> 01:30:58,421
This is my "fuck you" money.

1169
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:01,546
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

1170
01:31:06,588 --> 01:31:08,588
We don't have enough men
to carry this money,

1171
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,255
so we might as well be warm.

1172
01:31:24,421 --> 01:31:25,296
Oh, Jesus.

1173
01:31:26,255 --> 01:31:28,130
Jesus Christ.

1174
01:31:31,921 --> 01:31:33,005
Ah.

1175
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:44,630
- That's more like it.
<i>- Este loco...</i>

1176
01:31:47,463 --> 01:31:50,713
Oh! Oh, my God! Holy shit.

1177
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:54,213
Now that's a fire!

1178
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,713
- Oh, shit! Shit.
- Ah, Fuck.

1179
01:32:34,796 --> 01:32:35,755
I'm hit!

1180
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:42,130
- Benny, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just grazed my shoulder.

1181
01:32:42,838 --> 01:32:44,421
Shooter's up on the ridge line.

1182
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:51,505
Oh, he likes me so much.
I'll stay here, hold his fire.

1183
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:52,713
You guys go around the side.

1184
01:32:54,255 --> 01:32:55,838
Pope, can you step out?

1185
01:32:56,713 --> 01:32:57,921
Work up the trailhead.

1186
01:32:58,546 --> 01:32:59,463
All right.

1187
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:02,005
Flank right, make sure no one else
is coming up below.

1188
01:33:03,046 --> 01:33:04,046
I'll cut up behind you.

1189
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:06,130
Benny, you all right?

1190
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:09,880
Yeah, I'm fine. We'll hold
down here until you get into position.

1191
01:33:30,046 --> 01:33:32,005
I think Pope's in position right now.

1192
01:33:32,088 --> 01:33:33,130
Yeah, let's move.

1193
01:35:03,546 --> 01:35:04,713
Tom!

1194
01:35:04,921 --> 01:35:06,088
Tom!

1195
01:35:06,421 --> 01:35:09,255
Tom. Come on... Come on.

1196
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:20,963
Come on, Tom. Come on, man.

1197
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:23,588
Come on, man. Come on...

1198
01:35:30,338 --> 01:35:31,880
Let me see. Let me see.

1199
01:35:34,921 --> 01:35:36,421
Oh, my God!

1200
01:35:49,796 --> 01:35:51,088
Let's get him wrapped up.

1201
01:35:51,838 --> 01:35:53,130
We need to keep moving.

1202
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,796
What the fuck are you talking about?

1203
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,671
You're a heartless son of a bitch!

1204
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:05,630
It was your little fire
that got him fucking killed!

1205
01:36:16,213 --> 01:36:17,296
Stop it.

1206
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:21,338
Stop this shit. Stop this shit.

1207
01:36:21,421 --> 01:36:23,296
Fucking stop this!

1208
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,755
Stop this shit! Stop it!

1209
01:36:25,838 --> 01:36:28,671
- Stop this shit!
- Fuck you, Benny! Fuck you!

1210
01:36:29,546 --> 01:36:32,255
It wasn't the fire that gave us away.

1211
01:36:33,671 --> 01:36:34,838
That kid was from the village.

1212
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:38,630
He's been tracking us for days.

1213
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,171
He obviously wanted a clear shot at Tom.

1214
01:36:43,838 --> 01:36:44,796
He wanted him.

1215
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,921
But we do have to get
the fuck out of here,

1216
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:53,171
and we are taking
all of that money with us.

1217
01:36:53,796 --> 01:36:55,630
Tom's family deserves it!

1218
01:36:56,755 --> 01:36:57,713
And so do we.

1219
01:37:01,255 --> 01:37:03,296
All right, let's wrap him up.
We carry him down.

1220
01:37:28,255 --> 01:37:29,630
Rest in peace, brother.

1221
01:37:33,338 --> 01:37:35,296
You rest in peace.

1222
01:39:00,505 --> 01:39:02,630
How late are we
to meet the guy with the boat?

1223
01:39:03,338 --> 01:39:04,296
Five days.

1224
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,421
Jesus. You think he's still there?

1225
01:39:10,005 --> 01:39:11,296
I can't see shit.

1226
01:39:14,963 --> 01:39:16,505
We need to get one of us down there.

1227
01:39:18,046 --> 01:39:20,421
Think one of you can make it
there and back?

1228
01:39:21,963 --> 01:39:22,838
I'll go.

1229
01:39:24,796 --> 01:39:25,963
Your Spanish sucks, Benny.

1230
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:28,671
I got it.

1231
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:31,088
You sure?

1232
01:39:34,963 --> 01:39:35,796
Three?

1233
01:39:36,296 --> 01:39:37,130
Yeah.

1234
01:39:39,046 --> 01:39:40,963
You're looking for the <i>Hijo Pródigo.</i>

1235
01:39:50,338 --> 01:39:51,796
Benny, watch your six.

1236
01:39:53,588 --> 01:39:54,630
You watch yours.

1237
01:40:17,463 --> 01:40:19,463
I'm gonna say something.
Are you listening?

1238
01:40:21,546 --> 01:40:22,380
Yeah.

1239
01:40:23,838 --> 01:40:25,421
We gotta get back on our game.

1240
01:40:27,005 --> 01:40:29,338
Enough of this. It stops now.
You understand?

1241
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:32,213
Copy that.

1242
01:40:33,005 --> 01:40:33,880
Good.

1243
01:40:38,171 --> 01:40:39,963
How many people
do you think you've killed?

1244
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,796
What?

1245
01:40:43,046 --> 01:40:44,046
You heard me.

1246
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:48,213
As many as I had to.

1247
01:40:48,713 --> 01:40:50,171
Why would you ever wanna know that?

1248
01:40:53,463 --> 01:40:55,463
- Forty-three.
- Jesus!

1249
01:40:56,588 --> 01:40:57,463
Confirmed.

1250
01:40:58,588 --> 01:41:00,713
You keep count of everything, huh?

1251
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:03,505
Yep.

1252
01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:05,421
How's your sleep?

1253
01:41:09,338 --> 01:41:11,005
I guess better than it should be.

1254
01:41:35,171 --> 01:41:36,046
You all right?

1255
01:41:37,171 --> 01:41:38,421
The boat's there.

1256
01:41:39,963 --> 01:41:41,463
I gave him half the money.

1257
01:41:41,755 --> 01:41:42,796
I hope he waits.

1258
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,588
I didn't go into town,

1259
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:49,005
but it looks like
whoever's in charge there...

1260
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:53,463
has a... kindergarten army
that's looking for us.

1261
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:56,546
- How many of them?
- Two or three pros,

1262
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,005
20 heavily-armed teenagers.

1263
01:42:00,463 --> 01:42:01,838
What about the next town over?

1264
01:42:01,921 --> 01:42:03,838
It's over 100 miles to the south.

1265
01:42:04,088 --> 01:42:06,380
I'm sure they've got
every town covered anyway.

1266
01:42:07,296 --> 01:42:09,505
Must be what's left of Lorea's guys.

1267
01:42:09,796 --> 01:42:10,921
So we go through 'em.

1268
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:14,755
Through them?

1269
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:16,505
What, do you mean we mow them all down?

1270
01:42:16,588 --> 01:42:17,755
What's the alternative here?

1271
01:42:18,796 --> 01:42:22,213
I'm not prepared
to wipe out every teenager in that town

1272
01:42:22,463 --> 01:42:24,505
just to get through with this cargo.

1273
01:42:24,796 --> 01:42:25,921
This cargo?

1274
01:42:27,296 --> 01:42:28,755
What about that cargo?

1275
01:42:29,796 --> 01:42:31,088
Will you do it for him?

1276
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,380
Tom died for this money,

1277
01:42:34,463 --> 01:42:36,088
and we're not leaving this country
without it!

1278
01:42:36,171 --> 01:42:38,796
He didn't die <i>for </i>that money,
he died <i>because </i>of it!

1279
01:42:45,255 --> 01:42:46,630
They're just kids, man.

1280
01:42:46,713 --> 01:42:48,338
Can't we carry it out through the dark?

1281
01:42:48,796 --> 01:42:50,921
It's over 100 bags.
There's no way.

1282
01:42:51,838 --> 01:42:53,088
Let me talk to him.

1283
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:02,880
Look, Benny's telling us these are kids,
man.

1284
01:43:07,296 --> 01:43:10,338
I can't believe...
I can't believe I let this happen.

1285
01:43:11,921 --> 01:43:14,588
Look, we all came here
of our own free will.

1286
01:43:16,171 --> 01:43:17,046
Yeah, but...

1287
01:43:17,546 --> 01:43:20,796
I thought we could...
I thought we could do this.

1288
01:43:23,046 --> 01:43:24,130
Yeah.

1289
01:43:25,588 --> 01:43:27,171
And we got what we deserved.

1290
01:43:29,463 --> 01:43:30,421
I'm sorry.

1291
01:43:31,755 --> 01:43:32,588
Yeah, me, too.

1292
01:43:33,796 --> 01:43:35,588
- But we can't do this.
- I know.

1293
01:43:36,421 --> 01:43:37,380
I know.

1294
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:51,505
We can't just... go through 'em.

1295
01:43:52,421 --> 01:43:53,921
I don't know what I was saying.

1296
01:43:55,505 --> 01:43:56,380
It's all right.

1297
01:43:57,088 --> 01:43:58,588
We've just gotta get Tom home.

1298
01:43:59,546 --> 01:44:00,588
That's all that matters.

1299
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:03,255
How are we gonna do that?

1300
01:44:03,671 --> 01:44:05,171
We keep carrying him down.

1301
01:44:06,088 --> 01:44:08,213
We fill our days packs
with whatever we can...

1302
01:44:09,088 --> 01:44:11,046
Whatever we can carry, and that's it.

1303
01:44:12,005 --> 01:44:13,505
What do we do with the rest of it?

1304
01:44:32,171 --> 01:44:33,130
Fuck.

1305
01:44:40,921 --> 01:44:43,171
Fuck me.

1306
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:44,505
That'll work.

1307
01:44:45,255 --> 01:44:46,838
Snow will be coming in soon.

1308
01:44:48,671 --> 01:44:50,255
Nobody'll ever see it again.

1309
01:44:51,838 --> 01:44:52,755
Good.

1310
01:44:56,838 --> 01:44:58,130
All right, let's keep going.

1311
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:30,005
Let's put him down for a second.

1312
01:45:37,505 --> 01:45:38,838
We're running behind.

1313
01:45:38,921 --> 01:45:40,880
Benny, you should go.
The sun's coming up.

1314
01:45:41,838 --> 01:45:43,713
We'll meet you down at the cove in 30.

1315
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,296
- All right. Be careful.
- Always.

1316
01:46:42,713 --> 01:46:44,421
Thank you for waiting.

1317
01:46:46,005 --> 01:46:47,588
The boat is ready.

1318
01:46:53,505 --> 01:46:54,963
No, wait. Whoa.

1319
01:46:56,546 --> 01:46:57,505
Is there anyone?

1320
01:46:59,338 --> 01:47:01,338
- It looks abandoned.
- Cover me.

1321
01:47:05,046 --> 01:47:06,546
Stop! Hands up!

1322
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:09,588
- Stop!
- Put your hands up!

1323
01:47:09,671 --> 01:47:11,130
Wait! Wait!

1324
01:47:14,296 --> 01:47:15,171
Listen!

1325
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:19,505
Little brother, be careful with that gun.
Don't point it at me.

1326
01:47:19,588 --> 01:47:23,130
I speak English!
What's in the bag? What is that?

1327
01:47:23,213 --> 01:47:24,171
It's our friend.

1328
01:47:24,921 --> 01:47:27,546
- He's dead.
- I call boss.

1329
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:29,588
- No, don't do that.
- Stop!

1330
01:47:31,005 --> 01:47:33,338
We don't have any problem with you.

1331
01:47:34,005 --> 01:47:35,005
Right, guys?

1332
01:47:35,088 --> 01:47:36,421
- We don't have a problem with him.
- No problem.

1333
01:47:36,505 --> 01:47:39,296
- I'm taking a shot.
- No! No. Don't do that.

1334
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:40,880
It's okay.

1335
01:47:40,963 --> 01:47:42,213
Uh-uh.

1336
01:47:44,546 --> 01:47:46,213
Hey, calm down.

1337
01:47:46,671 --> 01:47:48,921
This is 16! I need help!

1338
01:47:51,588 --> 01:47:52,588
Dumbass!

1339
01:47:52,671 --> 01:47:53,963
- Where are the keys?
- I don't know.

1340
01:47:54,046 --> 01:47:56,880
They just left me here with just the car
and the radio.

1341
01:47:57,088 --> 01:47:58,046
Fuck!

1342
01:47:58,421 --> 01:47:59,546
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1343
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:00,463
Are you lying?

1344
01:48:00,546 --> 01:48:02,713
Hey, hey, kid, just relax, all right?

1345
01:48:02,796 --> 01:48:05,838
<i>Sixteen? Sixteen, is that you?</i>

1346
01:48:05,921 --> 01:48:07,880
<i>We're going to send someone.</i>

1347
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,755
Yes! Fuck yes!

1348
01:48:12,838 --> 01:48:14,171
Let's move. Let's get it outta here.

1349
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:17,296
- Grab his radio.
- Got it.

1350
01:48:22,255 --> 01:48:23,671
Here's a little advice:

1351
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:26,963
Get away from these men.

1352
01:48:27,046 --> 01:48:28,130
Let's move!

1353
01:48:28,213 --> 01:48:29,963
Go home. Get out of here.

1354
01:48:30,046 --> 01:48:31,630
<i>Vamos,</i> Pope!

1355
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,380
Did you give that fucking kid money?

1356
01:48:39,463 --> 01:48:41,880
We should have killed that kid
as soon as he saw our faces.

1357
01:48:41,963 --> 01:48:43,713
We are not killing any more people.

1358
01:48:44,171 --> 01:48:47,046
I'll tell you right now, if we get
to that beach and Ben isn't there,

1359
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,421
I'm fucking killing people.

1360
01:48:48,505 --> 01:48:50,755
All right, he'll be there. Fuck!

1361
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:54,505
Shit.

1362
01:48:56,505 --> 01:48:57,546
Fuck.

1363
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:06,630
- Come on! Come on!
- Can we go?

1364
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:10,796
What the hell is this?

1365
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:11,713
Shit!

1366
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:13,671
<i>They crashed</i>
<i>into us! Look out, be careful!</i>

1367
01:49:13,755 --> 01:49:16,880
<i>- They're heading to the beach.</i>
<i>- They just passed.</i>

1368
01:49:16,963 --> 01:49:19,171
<i>- Everybody head towards the palm trees.</i>
- What did he say?

1369
01:49:19,255 --> 01:49:21,713
- More are coming.
- There's two vehicles!

1370
01:49:21,796 --> 01:49:24,213
All right, it should open up
onto the beach any minute.

1371
01:49:24,296 --> 01:49:25,463
Pope, shoot!

1372
01:49:25,546 --> 01:49:26,380
Fuck!

1373
01:49:26,463 --> 01:49:29,880
Shoot the driver! What is wrong with you?

1374
01:49:30,963 --> 01:49:32,005
<i>Give some room!</i>

1375
01:49:32,088 --> 01:49:34,046
- Left!
<i>- They're firing!</i>

1376
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:36,463
<i>Stay behind!</i>

1377
01:49:58,588 --> 01:50:00,005
They're right on us!

1378
01:50:11,213 --> 01:50:12,338
Where are they?

1379
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,630
Left! Left!

1380
01:50:21,255 --> 01:50:22,255
Left!

1381
01:50:25,338 --> 01:50:26,588
Goddamn!

1382
01:50:27,755 --> 01:50:29,171
All right, here's the beach.

1383
01:50:35,588 --> 01:50:37,171
Where is he? Do you see him?

1384
01:50:37,963 --> 01:50:41,921
No, but the cove where we're supposed
to meet him's about a mile up this beach.

1385
01:51:00,505 --> 01:51:01,755
Pope, kill them!

1386
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:03,755
Just kill them!

1387
01:51:15,296 --> 01:51:16,588
There it is!

1388
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:25,505
- Do I wave him in?
- Hell yeah!

1389
01:51:26,921 --> 01:51:27,921
Go!

1390
01:51:28,171 --> 01:51:29,796
It looks like this is the end of the road.

1391
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,963
I see it.

1392
01:51:31,255 --> 01:51:34,380
We gotta cross over the dune!
Cross over the dune!

1393
01:51:55,296 --> 01:51:56,213
Let's go!

1394
01:52:08,838 --> 01:52:09,838
Come on!

1395
01:53:07,713 --> 01:53:10,796
<i>Minus the expenses,</i>
<i>and our administrative fee,</i>

1396
01:53:11,255 --> 01:53:16,463
that leaves $5,334,120...

1397
01:53:17,171 --> 01:53:18,296
cut five ways.

1398
01:53:18,588 --> 01:53:23,630
Which gives you five shares of $1,066,824.

1399
01:53:24,296 --> 01:53:27,755
Oh, and I need all of your signatures
on the fifth contract here.

1400
01:53:28,296 --> 01:53:32,213
It'll deposit the deceased's share
into the Redfly Family Trust.

1401
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,338
Here you are.

1402
01:53:50,671 --> 01:53:53,796
I'd like you to please include my share
into the family trust.

1403
01:54:17,296 --> 01:54:18,213
Me, too.

1404
01:54:25,505 --> 01:54:26,380
Thank you.

1405
01:54:54,588 --> 01:54:57,755
So, I will schedule
all the payments to the family trust.

1406
01:55:00,213 --> 01:55:01,130
Of course.

1407
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,005
- Thank you. That's for you.
- Thank you. I'll be in touch.

1408
01:55:30,796 --> 01:55:33,130
So, what are you guys gonna do now?

1409
01:55:35,421 --> 01:55:36,796
I gotta get home.

1410
01:55:38,171 --> 01:55:39,380
Not without these.

1411
01:55:44,963 --> 01:55:46,671
That'll help.

1412
01:55:58,005 --> 01:55:59,088
See you.

1413
01:56:03,005 --> 01:56:04,213
Take care of yourself.

1414
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:12,213
See you, buddy.

1415
01:56:14,338 --> 01:56:15,380
Love you, man.

1416
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:17,088
I love you, too.

1417
01:56:21,421 --> 01:56:23,421
- I'll see you in a bit, all right?
- See you.

1418
01:56:32,046 --> 01:56:33,421
So, what you gonna do now?

1419
01:56:36,421 --> 01:56:38,463
I don't know.

1420
01:56:39,963 --> 01:56:41,005
Maybe I'll, uh...

1421
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:44,005
I'll go see this girl I know in Australia.

1422
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:49,338
Yeah, you should.
I hear she recently came into some money.

1423
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:53,130
I guess she made out
a whole hell of a lot better

1424
01:56:53,213 --> 01:56:54,255
than any of us did.

1425
01:56:55,421 --> 01:56:56,838
That seems about right.

1426
01:57:00,588 --> 01:57:02,630
When you see Molly and the girls...

1427
01:57:06,505 --> 01:57:08,713
remind them who he was.

1428
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:10,296
Yeah, I will.

1429
01:57:18,588 --> 01:57:20,171
Take care of yourself, all right?

1430
01:57:20,921 --> 01:57:21,755
You, too.

1431
01:57:24,421 --> 01:57:27,088
Maybe we can go
do something good with it one day.
