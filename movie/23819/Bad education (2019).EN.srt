Bob Spicer: Well, thank you,
thank you all,

2
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:47,666
parents and town
advocates alike,

3
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:51,083
for joining us on
this very special evening.

4
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:53,916
We're here tonight to kick off

5
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:56,707
our most ambitious
school year yet.

6
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,415
We've run the numbers,
and folks,

7
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:03,749
there's no simpler way
for me to put it.

8
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,207
Our children
are getting smarter.

9
00:01:09,707 --> 00:01:14,666
Harvard, two.
Dartmouth, two.

10
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:17,041
Yale, three.

11
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:18,999
U Penn, seven.

12
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,165
Thank you.

13
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,874
And my fellow trustees

14
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,457
who wait all year long

15
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,374
ranking the top
public schools in America

16
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:57,999
based on SATs and college
acceptance rates.

17
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:01,083
And Roslyn is four...

18
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,666
And now, I'd like to bring out
the man responsible.

19
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:10,124
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:11,749
In his ten years here,

21
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,207
he's revamped
our education system.

22
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,791
From pre-K all the way
to high school.

23
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:20,165
Please join me in welcoming
to the stage

24
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:23,124

and my friend,

Frank:
Have we heard about
Mr. Kopple?

32
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,041
- Wife had twins.
- Twins!

33

- Late last night.
- Nice. Send over flowers

34
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,249
and maybe an edible arrangement.

35
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:21,892

these things out of here?

- Yeah, it'd be even nicer

if they were shaped like ones.

A wise woman once said
it's not having what you want.

I barely recognize you anymore
what with the new name,

00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,290
new office, new job title.

43
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:37,624
The same pay, same paperwork.

00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:39,374
July and August

Jeez, someone's
had their coffee.

- Yeah.
- Jenny: Uh, Dr. Tassone?

00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,225

00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,290
Thanks, J.
Whatever's cheaper works fine.

00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:57,290
And, uh, Mary Ann,
is there any way

55
00:03:57,374 --> 00:03:58,642

my diet smoothie?

Carol Schweitzer's

59
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,958
in the conference room
since 6:30.

60
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,266
Says it's urgent
she speaks with you.

61
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,041
Okay, okay. Um...

62
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:09,958
- Chad.
- Chad, Chad Schweitzer's...

okay, I'll take care of it.

- Good luck.

Stop it.

Do us all a favor.

If he's not out of there
in an hour, call 911.

Carol:
And I am banging down doors

69
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:22,457
until somebody here

70
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:24,332
takes me seriously.
All right?

71
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:27,415
That Militzok,
she plays favorites, okay?

72
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,308
She wouldn't even let him
take a bathroom break

73
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:32,207
during the test,
and he has
a hyperactive bladder.

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,916
Chad, honey, tell him how you...

75
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,100
you know what, I have a note
here from his doctor, okay?

76
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,916
Ms. Schweitzer,
just, just calm down.

77
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,249
- Let's, let's just...
- No one will listen to me.

78
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,100
All right, I don't know
what else I'm supposed to do.

79
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:44,958
Chad, he is just as gifted
as everyone else in his year.

80
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,624
- Absolutely.
- And...

81
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,374
I'm scared, Dr. Tassone,

82
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:50,791
because if he
doesn't get into OMNI...

83
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,085
and he starts to think
of himself as less than...

84
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:55,541
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

85
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:57,249
No, I will talk
to Ms. Militzok.

86
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,332
I will straighten
this whole thing out.

87
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:00,624
- You will?
- Yes.

88
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,999
And, and we'll just set
a make-up test for Chad.

89
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,791
All right, with ample
bathroom time.

90

Thank you, Dr. Tassone.

91
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:08,094
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate that.

92
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:09,517
There's no need to thank me,
all right?

93
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,457
Chad's a smart kid with
the world ahead of him,

94
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,374
and it's our job
to give him the runway.

95
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:15,666
Thank you.

96
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:21,541
It's funny.

97
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,332
You know, Chad,
when I was your age,

98
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,958
I didn't even place
into fast track math.

99
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,958
- Really?
- No.

100
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,457
I couldn't nail my times tables.

101
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,707
And at the time,
I thought my world was ending.

102
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,874
But I caught up.
You know what?

103
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,415

I hope he's keeping
out of trouble
over at Northwestern.

120
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,666
Yeah, he loves it.
He's doing bio-chem.

121
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,916
Ah, well, they have
great journalism there, too.

122
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:52,791
Yes, they do.

about the SkyWalk proposal
in the new budget.

126
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:03,457
And I just need a pull quote
from administration.

127
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,499
Yeah, oh, okay.
A sound bite, nice.

128
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,624
Um...

129
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:10,874
We've been asking high schoolers

130
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,332
how we can make
their day easier,

131
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:16,083
so we came up with this idea,
the SkyWalk.

132
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:20,165
Um, a bridge,
to link the school
from end to end.

133
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,124
And um, it's a
huge undertaking for us.

134
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,749

Great, that's all I need.
Thank you so much.

137
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,207
That's it?
No, no follow-ups?

138
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,499
No, it's just a puff piece.

139
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,874
They save the real stories

141
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,833
It's only a puff piece

Oh, uh...

143
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,958
That's what they'll tell you
over at Northwestern.

144
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,332
All right?
A real journalist

145
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:55,165
can turn any assignment
into a story.

146
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:02,124
Are you busy?
Just a couple of colleagues
want to convey thanks.

Rachel Bhargava, staff writer
for the "Hilltop Beacon."

148
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,332
Uh, this is Bob Spicer,
school board president.

149
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:09,624
- Hi. Oh, you're, uh...

You're in my daughter,
Becca's year, right?

151
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:13,207
- Mm-hmm.
- Say hi to your dad for me.

152
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,135
Nice to meet you, Rachel.
And if you want to

153
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:17,541
follow up, just set a time
with Mary Ann, okay?

154
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,707
And, uh, I'll be keeping
an eye out for your byline.

155
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,457
The demand is insane.
It's skyrocketing.

156
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,059
We're seeing three bedrooms
go for over a million
in Roslyn Heights.

157
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,923
Yeah, you just don't
see those kinds of numbers

158
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,290
in Syosset or Jericho.

159
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:35,517
Right, but those towns are
a further commute from the city.

160
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,958
Not Manhasset, not Great Neck.

161
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,249
It's the public schools.
The better the school system,

162
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,132
the higher the price tag
on the homes, period.

163
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,707
Bob:
Our firm has sold nine
separate lots in that area

164
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,308
since the report in
that journal came out.

165
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:46,916
And, uh,
here's a little something

166
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:49,374
- you know, from all of us.
- Frank: Okay.

167
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:53,415
Oh, wow.
Really, that's, oh, wow.

168
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,001
- Keep up the good work.
- Well, thanks, everyone.

169
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,457
- Dr. Tassone?

00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,541
Speaker:
I know what
you're all thinking.

343
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,582
At first glance, these numbers
might seem prohibitive

344
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,582
but I'm here to tell you
that with some vision,

345
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,124
they can dovetail
quite amicably.

346
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,332
As we can see,
the added benefits

347
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,999
to such a program
are remunerative.

348
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,600
I'd love for you to see
what we're doing out there

349
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:38,059
- if you're ever on Long Island.
- Yeah, I think,

350
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,374
I think we're on the East Coast
in November, December.

351
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:41,833
- So I'll...
- Well, we're there.

352
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,249
- Good, good, good, good.
- Okay.

353
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:44,683
And listen, stop by
and have a drink
before you leave.

354
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:45,934
- All right?
- That was terrific.

355
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,124
- Thank you.
- Take care.

356
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:54,249
Bartender: Great.

357
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,666
All right.

358
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,499
What can I get ya?

359
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,874
Uh, just a club soda with lime.

360
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,958
And can I see
your food menu, please?

361
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:17,666
And...

362
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,207
Frank: Kyle.

363
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,999
Kyle Contreras.

364
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:32,541
Plandome High
maybe 15 years ago, right?

365
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,124
Yeah, I used to
teach English there.

366
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,165
Dr. Tassone.

367
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:39,165
Frank.

368
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,666
Frank.

369
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,332
Kyle:
I would think that
you would forget

370
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,083
about us the minute
we got out of there.

371
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,916
Frank:
Oh, no,
you'd be surprised.

372
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,639
I mean, some things
I wish I could forget.

373
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,083
Kyle: Yeah.
You know somethin'

374
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:53,374
I wish I could forget?
Would be Lippman's hair piece.

375
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:54,777
Do you remember
that thing that...

376
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,582
- With the, with
the double swoop?

377
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:00,874
Oh, my God, Lippman's
hair piece, Christ.

378
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,833
So, what do you, what do you...

379
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,624
Are you teaching English
at the new place?

380
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:07,874
No, I'm, I'm administrative now.

381
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,707
Like a principal?

382
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,999
No, like
superintendent of schools.

383
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:14,666
Look at that.
You love saying that.

384
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,332
You love that.
Superintendent of schools.

385
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:19,375
- With the head, too.
- I've done it for 12 years.

386
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:20,791
I mean, look, it's great.

387
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:22,958
It does have its trade-offs,
like anything.

388
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,641
I really miss being back
in the classroom

389
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,707
sometimes with my students,
you know.

390
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,916
How about you?
You, um, you still writing?

391
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,374
Short stories, science fiction,
right?

392
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:34,124
I remember you used
to carry around

393
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,874
that beat-up copy
of "Dune" everywhere.

394
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,457
Yeah, I mostly
just wrote that stuff

395
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,833
to get out of your book reports.

396
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,956
No, come on, come on.
There was that really good one

397
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:44,249
about the, um,
about the alien colony.

398
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:47,249
I talked about it in your rec
for Stony Brook, right?

399
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:50,415
Yeah, yeah, for Stony Brook.

400
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,791
Sorry, I, um...

401
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,374
I burnt out at Stony Brook.

402
00:19:57,582 --> 00:19:59,124
After a few years, I...

403
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,791
moved out here.

404
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:03,457
Um...

405
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:07,958
I was dancing
up until very recently.

406
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,707
Dancing?

407
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:14,415
Thank you.

408
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:25,165
So does your wife
come with you
on these things, or...

409
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,541
- Oh, um...
- Is she back in New York?

410
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:29,457
No, no, no, my wife passed away.

411
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:33,124
Oh.

412
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,124
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's...

413
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:39,249
it's fine.
It was a long time ago.

414
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,457
Um, it was before
I had you, even.

Uh, just for the weekend, yeah.

421
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,374
A lot of suits for a weekend.

422
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:27,582

Even when you were
an English teacher,

426
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,083
you were always
the guy in the suits.

There's, there's no way.

I took her word for it.

653

She would tell me one thing,
she'd say don't worry about it,

654
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:08,207

fucking idiot schmuck I am.

655
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:12,499
Oh, I never even think
to check up, to validate.

656
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:15,165
I'm gonna lose my job.
I'm gonna lose our firm.

657

- Hey, hey, no, no, no...

658

Nobody's killing anybody.
Phil, look me in the eye.

00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:26,707
You're running the show here.
Say it after me.

"I am running the show."

662
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:33,290

- Good.

663
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:35,582
Pull it together.

664
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,457
How much did
you find concretely?

665
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:40,457
Uh...

666
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,749
Two hundred twenty-three.

667
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:46,007
Concretely, but that's
just the obvious stuff.

668
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,374
- Who knows what else is buried...
- $223,000.

669
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,541
Okay, okay.

670
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:57,874

671
00:35:58,874 --> 00:36:00,183

- That's the number

672
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:01,749
we go back
to the board with, 223.

673
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,207
No, you're not hearing me.

674
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,683

They're in the bin
of a shredder, probably.

678
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,374
She could have misplaced them.

679
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:12,809
I mean, there's a very
real scenario here

680
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,999
where all the other expenses
are legit, right?

681
00:36:15,582 --> 00:36:17,624
- Maybe, I don't know.
- Okay, Phil, Phil.

682
00:36:17,707 --> 00:36:19,541
She's not some
criminal mastermind.

683
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:20,874
All right, Pam is our friend,

684
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:23,207
and she has made
a stupid mistake.

685
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,457
But what...

686
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:29,958
but what about
the state comptroller?

687
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,499
Hevesi could barge
into this office

688
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:34,707
at any given moment,
conduct an outside audit.

689
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,791
Has he ever done that once
in your 30 years of experience?

690
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:40,958
Exactly.

691
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,541
Just...

692
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:45,624
give me a number, and...

693
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:48,707
I'll take care of the board.

694
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:56,041
♪ ♪

695
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:17,124
Frank:
Okay, okay, everyone.

696
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:19,083
So, the, uh...

697
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:22,415
the sum total is $250,000.

698
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:23,899
- What?
- Jesus, are you kidding me?

699
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,183
- That woman
has a set of balls on her.
- We can just...

700
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:28,934
- When I get my chance.
- Bob: You never will.

701
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:30,874
She's gonna be Nassau PD's
for the taking.

702
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,600
- And that shitbird son of hers.
- No, no, no, no, no.

703
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:34,266
- No, no, no, Bob.
- Okay, all right,
let's do this right.

704
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,290
- Put the phone away, Bob.
- And why should he?

705
00:37:36,374 --> 00:37:38,999
Because we will lose everything.

706
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:44,707
What do you mean, Frank?

707
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,332
Once word gets out about Pam,

708
00:37:46,415 --> 00:37:48,791
we're inviting
"The Times," "Newsday,"

709
00:37:48,874 --> 00:37:50,916
and every other paper
in the tri-state area

710
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:52,475
- to our front door.
- With all due respect,

711
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,833
screw the papers.
This is a very real crime here.

712
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,290
A theft of taxpayer money.

713
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,725
Judy, you've served
on the school board

714
00:37:57,749 --> 00:37:58,916
for how long, seven years?

715
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:00,791
- Eight, proudly,
- Okay, and in eight years,

716
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:02,749
how many times
has our budget been passed

717
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,415
by taxpayers without incident?

718
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:05,791
- Eight.
- Right.

719
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:07,475
So what happens
when our next budget goes up

720
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:08,749
for approval in May?

721
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,541
The budget that
we've worked all year on.

722
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:12,499
The stimulus that
gets us the SkyWalk.

723
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,916
That gets us to first.
What happens?

724
00:38:15,165 --> 00:38:16,541
Wendy:
I get what he's saying.

725
00:38:16,624 --> 00:38:18,415
I mean, how's it going to look?

726
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,958
A school employee
is able to take

727
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,249
hundreds of thousands of dollars
from the coffer

728
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:24,624
without anyone noticing.

729
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:27,415
Why would we pump more money
into the school system?

730
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,059
Right, if a scandal
this seismic breaks,

731
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:31,582
I mean, our budget
is torpedoed, done.

732
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,946
We are right back to square one.

733
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:34,916
I don't know,
you can't pay the teachers.

734
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,415
Maybe they start migrating out.

735
00:38:36,499 --> 00:38:38,707
Whoa, this can't affect
the colleges, huh?

736
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,999
I think we'd have to expect
that admissions

737
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,363
at top-tier schools
would view us

738
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:43,958
under a radically
different lens, yeah.

739
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,681
No, wait, what, what,
why would they ever?

740
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:48,041
If they smell trouble,
then they...

741
00:38:48,707 --> 00:38:50,934
I don't know,
they might decide to lay off
Roslyn kids for a while.

742
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,457
"Yeses" can become
"nos" overnight.

743
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,582
I've-I've heard of that
happening before.

744
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,833
I have.
So anyway, let's just...

745
00:38:57,457 --> 00:38:59,041
let's tease this out, okay?

746
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,916
We don't perform,
we go down in the rankings.

747
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:05,707
And then our sister schools
nose us out of
the top ten, top hundred.

748
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,541
Syosset and Jericho,
those sons of bitches.

749
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:08,850
Frank:
And that's when
we start seeing

750
00:39:08,874 --> 00:39:10,874
property values
adversely affected.

751
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:19,415
He's right.
Of course he is.

752
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,582
As far as real estate,

753
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,290
especially Long Island,

754
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,165
a town is only as good as its...

755
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:27,791
Public school system.

756
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,124
After everything
we've worked for, huh?

757
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:36,083
Years that it's taken to,
to, to get this far.

758
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:41,415
These are our kids
we're talking about.

759
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,749
I can think of one other option.

760
00:39:50,332 --> 00:39:51,582
Frank.

761
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:54,165
Everything's gonna be okay, Pam.

762
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:57,624
We're, we're gonna get you
home to your family real soon.

763
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:00,249
We're good, close the door.

764
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,249
The board is very aware
of how hard you worked

765
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:06,332
for the schools,
for Roslyn, for their kids.

766
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:09,165
They know what an asset
you've been, and, um...

767
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,332
that is why they see this
for-for what it is.

768
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:13,541
A lapse in judgment.

769
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:15,207
And in light of that,
they're opting

770
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,457
not to press charges
or involve the police.

771
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,374
Thank you, thank you.
All of you.

772
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:22,083
So you'll make full
restitution to the school

773
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:24,457
at the sum of $250,000.

774
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:27,290
250, full...
Full restitution, of course.

775
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:28,541
I'll, I'll make it happen.

776
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:29,850
And then you'll finish out
the work week

777
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:31,457
and resign quietly.

778
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,332
Wait.

779
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:38,499
- What?
- Frank: Okay.

780
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:39,809
Tomorrow morning,
you'll surrender

781
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:41,749
your administrators license
to the board

782
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,749
and you'll sign
an NDA committing...

783
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:46,833
Frank, Frank, I don't...
I don't understand
what's happening.

784
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:48,666
I don't understand this.
Why are you...

785
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:51,457
You stole from the schools, Pam.

786
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,749
From, from the taxpayers.

787
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,165
From, from the kids
we're supposed to serve.

788
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,541
I mean, this...

789
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,541
kind of behavior goes beyond
the bounds of immoral.

790
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:03,457
It, it's, it's cruel, it's...

791
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,541
It's heinous.
It's, it's sociopathic, even.

792
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,290
Sociopathic, what?

793
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:09,707
The shameless self-interest.

794
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:12,582
The, the, the
unstable personality.

795
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:15,499
The parade
of rotten marriages, it...

796
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,207
Frank.

797
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:20,874
Look, you need help, Pam.

798
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:23,041
Real medical help.

799
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:24,958
You're a sick woman.

800
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,041
We're concerned about you, Pam.

801
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,374
Um...

802
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,332
I am...

803
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:45,165
I'm a sick woman.

804
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:47,541
I'm...

805
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:50,707
I'm ashamed of my actions.
I'm ashamed of myself. I'm...

806
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:53,499
There's no excuse for it.

807
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:56,499
Well, the sociopathy.

808
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,916
- Yeah, Bob, the...
- Yeah.

809
00:42:02,624 --> 00:42:03,707
Okay.

810
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:06,483
We'll make all the arrangements
first thing tomorrow morning.

811
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,749
Yeah, of course.

812
00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:21,374
Good night, all.

813
00:42:26,582 --> 00:42:28,582
Judy:
Well, that went better
than I thought.

814
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,124
Bob:
You saved our ass, Frank.

815
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:33,791
- Woman: Oh, God, yeah.
- Thank you.

816
00:42:33,874 --> 00:42:35,083
Woman: Yeah.

817
00:43:06,124 --> 00:43:07,624
What the hell was that?

818
00:43:08,707 --> 00:43:10,582
I... can you hear me?

819
00:43:11,624 --> 00:43:12,624
Frank?

820
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,374
Okay.

821
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:18,958
I'm just, I'm just trying to...

822
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:20,749
I'm trying to wrap
my head around this.

823
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:54,290
Kyle:
Hey.

824
00:43:54,374 --> 00:43:55,694
I wasn't sure
you were gonna call.

825
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:59,499
Kyle:
Is everything okay?

826
00:44:00,165 --> 00:44:01,999
Yeah, sorry, I, um...

827
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:05,165
just wanted to hear your voice.

828
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,207
- Pam: Where is he?
- Howard: Pam.

829
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,958
- Where is he?
- Howard: Pam, just...

830
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,600
- Just sit down for a second.
- Pam: No, I wanna talk to Jimmy.

831
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,183
- Where is he?
- Just sit down for a little bit.

832
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:31,600
Is he in this room?
No, he's in
his bedroom, isn't he?

833
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:32,833
- Just...
- Don't touch me.

834
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:34,249
- Don't touch me!
- All right!

835
00:44:37,582 --> 00:44:38,749
Hey, Ma.

836
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:44,541
Hi, Ma?

837
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:45,916
Hi, Ma?

838
00:44:46,749 --> 00:44:48,225
- Hey, Aunt Pam!
- Get outta my house, Jimmy!

839
00:44:48,249 --> 00:44:50,499
- Pam!
- I don't want you here anymore.

840
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:51,958
- Get the hell out!
- Pam.

841
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,642
- I don't wanna see
your face anymore.
- Pam, stop it.

842
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,059
- Stop it, you don't mean it.
- Hey, what's going on?

843
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,833
You don't mean it.
She doesn't mean it, Jim.

844
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:59,236
- She doesn't mean
one word of it.
- Amber: What's going on?

845
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,141
Howard:
Your mother lost her job today.

846
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,833
Yeah, not my job, Howard.
My career.

847
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:07,874
Amber:
I don't get it, can't you
just get a different job

848
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,374
at another school?

849
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:16,874
They're taking my license.

850
00:45:17,874 --> 00:45:19,415
Mom, what did you do?

851
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:25,083
I took money from them.

852
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:29,124
Yeah, I stole.
We all did.

853
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:31,600
Howard:
Okay, look, just go back
to your rooms, please.

854
00:45:31,624 --> 00:45:32,767
- Yeah.
- Please let me talk
to your mother.

855
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:34,290
Your car, your clothes.

856
00:45:34,374 --> 00:45:35,874
This house, the other houses.

857
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:39,457
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't want state school.

858
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:41,749
You wanted private college.

859
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:46,374
I wanted you
to be happy with me.

860
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:49,499
Pam, Pam, listen.
It's okay.

861
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,457
We'll get you a job down
at the dealership, okay?

862
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:56,083
Yeah, yeah, they're looking for
a new girl at the front desk.

863
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,207
- Like a secretary?
- No, no.

864
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,666
Not, not as...
Not like a secretary.

865
00:46:00,749 --> 00:46:02,308
You'll find something.
I'm just saying...

866
00:46:02,332 --> 00:46:03,499
- I have degrees.
- I know.

867
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:06,374
I went to school for years
to get degrees.

868
00:46:06,457 --> 00:46:08,707
I drove the bus.
I did the steno pool.

869
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:11,332
- I did everything I had to.
- Listen to me, Pam.

870
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:13,290
- Listen to me.
- I'm gonna be sick.

871
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:15,916
You are the smartest woman
I have ever known.

872
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:17,600
We're gonna get through this
and you're gonna

873
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:19,457
land on your feet, you will.

874
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,499
Come here.

875
00:46:23,874 --> 00:46:25,499
- Howard.
- I know.

876
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:27,707
- Howard.
- I know.

877
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:29,582
I know.

878
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,165
Rachel:
Hi, Mrs. Gluckin.

879
00:46:43,624 --> 00:46:44,999
Uh, I was just wondering.

880
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:47,083
Could I get the key
to the basement again?

881
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:49,624
I just want to look up
a few more things.

882
00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:51,874
What's this for, Rachel?

883
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:54,457
Rachel:
Just for some stuff
I wanted to verify.

884
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,249
I can answer your questions.

885
00:46:58,374 --> 00:47:00,499
Uh, okay, well...

886
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,791
I did the math,
and it looks like the SkyWalk

887
00:47:03,874 --> 00:47:06,457
is gonna end up costing
around eight million dollars.

888
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:08,290
- Seven-five, sure.
- Right.

889
00:47:08,374 --> 00:47:10,582
It just seems like
a lot of our resources

890
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,415
to be spending on cosmetics.

891
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:16,749
Cosmetics?
People love the SkyWalk.

892
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,332
"The Beacon" loves the SkyWalk.

893
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:20,124
There was that nice poll
you guys did.

894
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:21,499
Right.

895
00:47:21,582 --> 00:47:24,124
But the ceilings at the
high school are still leaking.

896
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:26,247
I mean, some of the classrooms
had to get shut down.

897
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,350
Sounds like you
should bring that up

898
00:47:27,374 --> 00:47:29,207
with your student government.

899
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:33,290
There was also the pizza oven.

900
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:36,332
- What?
- I saw a line item

901
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:38,958
in the expense reports
for a pizza oven.

902
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,916
But then I asked Paula
in the cafeteria

903
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:42,519
and she said she knew
nothing about it.

904
00:47:42,582 --> 00:47:43,791
Just stop it.

905
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:50,415
I am sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

906
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:53,083
but no one is keeping
anything from you, okay?

907
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:55,833
On the contrary,
we come in here every day

908
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,290
at the crack of dawn
because we care.

909
00:47:58,749 --> 00:48:00,124
We care about providing you

910
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:03,707
with a proper quality education
because we're good people.

911
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:06,332
Because we want you
to have a good life.

912
00:48:06,415 --> 00:48:07,749
Okay?

913
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:10,958
Okay.

914
00:48:11,415 --> 00:48:12,541
Pam: Okay.

915
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,958
The individual purchase orders
are still public record, though.

916
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:27,666
Pam: Here you go.

917
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:31,415
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

918
00:48:32,124 --> 00:48:33,207
Oh, and Rachel.

919
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,374
You were right about
that pizza oven.

920
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,290
It didn't go to the high school

921
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:39,582
because we bought it
for the middle school.

922
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:42,541
Yeah, they have pizza
for days down there.

923
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:43,958
Go get yourself a slice.

924
00:48:50,457 --> 00:48:51,374
Frank: Morning.

925
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:53,083
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Rachel.

926
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:57,332
Dr. Tassone, Pam Gluckin's
in a bit of a state.

927
00:48:57,415 --> 00:48:58,999
Yeah, I have a very
busy morning.

928
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,833
Just tell her I can't.
Good morning.

929
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:04,165
Pam:
Frank, Frank, Frank!

930
00:49:04,249 --> 00:49:05,249
Fra...

931
00:49:10,874 --> 00:49:12,600
I'm sorry, Dr. Tassone's
very busy this morning.

932
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:13,683
Get out of my way, Mary Ann.

933
00:49:13,707 --> 00:49:15,290
- Pam, Pam.
- Please.

934
00:49:16,499 --> 00:49:18,165
You know what?
It's fine.

935
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,332
Everything's fine.

936
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:46,041
My exit interview for him.

937
00:49:55,457 --> 00:49:56,958
- Hey.
- Jenny: Hey, Dr. Tassone.

938
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:59,290
Uh, Mary Ann said
you wanted to see me?

939
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:01,749
Frank: Yes, yes.
Uh, take a seat.

940
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,707
Just close the door
behind you there.

941
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:11,457
So, I think maybe

942
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,415
it is time that we talked
about your value

943
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:16,041
in this workplace.

944
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,290
I, uh...

945
00:50:21,624 --> 00:50:23,541
- This isn't...
- No, rest assured,

946
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:26,083
we all want you to succeed here.

947
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:28,749
Which is...

948
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:32,833
Which is why we would like
to transition you

949
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:35,374
to our special utilities
department.

950
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,249
Oh.

951
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:40,290
Sir, um...

952
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:43,415
you know, I just thought I was
a really good fit up here.

953
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,999
Oh, yeah, no, no, no.
We're just doing some shuffling

954
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:48,415
and we could really use
an extra hand down there.

955
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:50,041
Okay?

956
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:54,582
What about Pam's old job?
You know, I thought maybe, uh,

957
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:56,666
you know, like a manager,
maybe I could be...

958
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:58,290
Maybe I could be right for that.

959
00:50:58,374 --> 00:50:59,850
Yeah, well, actually,
Philip Metzger's

960
00:50:59,874 --> 00:51:02,666
gonna be stepping in as
the interim business manager.

961
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:04,707
- Phil the auditor?
- Yeah, yeah.

962
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:07,749
I mean, until we can find
a more permanent
replacement for Pam.

963
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:09,249
But...

964
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,332
we're pretty excited about him.

965
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:18,415
I think that I should, uh...

966
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:21,457
think, um...

967
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,749
I know what you all did to Pam.

968
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,666
And I could,
you know, I could...

969
00:51:33,582 --> 00:51:35,958
maybe tell people.

970
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,541
Frank:
Sorry, hold on a second.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

971
00:51:38,624 --> 00:51:41,541
I just noticed that necklace
you have on.

972
00:51:41,624 --> 00:51:44,124
How it really
complements your eyes.

973
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:47,041
- Thank you.
- It's, uh,

974
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:48,541
yeah, that's,
that's new, isn't it?

975
00:51:48,624 --> 00:51:50,999
I don't think I've seen you
wearing it around before.

976
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:54,916
Yeah, I thought so.
Yeah. I've got...

977
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:57,249
I got sort of an eye for
these things, I don't know.

978
00:51:57,332 --> 00:51:58,958
So, um, what do you think?

979
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,666
Is that... is that
a Macy's purchase
or are we talking

980
00:52:01,749 --> 00:52:03,457
Lord & Taylor collection?

981
00:52:10,165 --> 00:52:11,916
Special utilities, you said?

982
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:14,165
Yeah, I think so.

983
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,624
Okay, thanks, Jen.

984
00:52:38,124 --> 00:52:40,874
Mary Ann, can I get a cup
of that new coffee in here?

985
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,141
Amber:
Oh, Rocco, you're so annoying.

986
00:52:51,165 --> 00:52:52,165
Get out of the way.

987
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,332
Go.

988
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,666
- Mom!
- Pam: This is she.

989
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:10,415
No.

990
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,165
Wait, what?

991
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:15,707
Yeah, thank you.
Please don't call here again.

992
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,225
- Who was that?
- That was a student.

993
00:53:17,249 --> 00:53:18,975
They want to donate
the fashion show proceeds

994
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:21,165
to help pay for
my medical expenses.

995
00:53:21,707 --> 00:53:23,225
- But you're not sick.
- Don't eat that.

996
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:24,249
We're returning them.

997
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:26,749
Pam, what the hell is going on?

998
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,457
Bob: Okay, uh...

999
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,207
first off, we want
to take a moment

1000
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,124
to acknowledge Pamela Gluckin.

1001
00:53:35,749 --> 00:53:38,666
Uh, our hearts go out to her
and her entire family

1002
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,707
and we wish her a safe
and speedy recovery, yeah.

1003
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,332
Okay, all right, now.

1004
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:47,749
Onto the fun stuff.

1005
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,165
Look at these numbers, folks.

1006
00:53:51,707 --> 00:53:54,165
These are the best
early decision numbers

1007
00:53:54,249 --> 00:53:56,124
that we've ever seen.

1008
00:53:56,582 --> 00:53:57,707
Yeah.

1009
00:53:57,791 --> 00:53:59,624

1031
00:55:46,582 --> 00:55:48,541
Hey, Rachel, um,
where's the article

1032
00:55:48,624 --> 00:55:50,541
on the
Cancer Benefit Fashion Show?

1033
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:52,916
I'll get that to you tomorrow.

1034
00:55:53,332 --> 00:55:54,916
But we go to print tomorrow.

1035
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,083
Okay, I'll have it tonight.

1036
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:59,707
Look, if you wanna be
a part of the paper,

1037
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,541
you gotta be a part
of the paper.

1038
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,165
Look, I'm gonna be late.

1039
00:56:03,249 --> 00:56:04,749
Rachel. Rachel!

1040
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:08,165
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.

1041
00:56:08,249 --> 00:56:10,624
- Sorry, shit.
- Seriously?

1042
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,374
What is this?

1043
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:19,916
It's just a personal project.
None of your business.

1044
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,541
Look, I'm sorry
for being a hard-ass.

1045
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,958
I know you're going through
a lot at home.

1046
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:30,541
What's that supposed to mean?

1047
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:34,041
You know, just everything
with your dad.

1048
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:36,249
Yeah, what about him?

1049
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:40,041
I mean, the parents
talk to each other.

1050
00:56:40,124 --> 00:56:42,791
I know that some shit
happened at work.

1051
00:56:44,249 --> 00:56:45,582
You don't know anything.

1052
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:47,999
Ow.
Fuck, Rachel.

1053
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:15,999
David: Rach?

1054
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:18,666
- Dinner.
- Okay.

1055
00:57:20,749 --> 00:57:21,874
What's all this?

1056
00:57:22,499 --> 00:57:24,165
Uh, research.

1057
00:57:24,249 --> 00:57:26,999
These are invoices
from the school district.

1058
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:38,499
The school district invoiced
over a million dollars

1059
00:57:38,582 --> 00:57:39,958
in lab equipment?

1060
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,041
And that's just one supplier.

1061
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,499
You thought about
calling this company?

1062
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,916
Oh, God, I'm gonna
miss my flight.

1063
00:58:03,332 --> 00:58:05,124
Not if you stay another day.

1064
00:58:05,374 --> 00:58:07,083
You know I can't do that.

1065
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,999
You could get a job here.

1066
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,791
There are schools
in Clark County.

1067
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:17,207
Sure, but good ones?

1068
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,165
Was Roslyn any good before you?

1069
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:33,457
Hi, is this Champion Products
in Uniondale?

1070
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,457
- Man: Yes, it is.
- Hi, my name is Rachel.

1071
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:37,183
I was just hoping to ask you
about a series of charges.

1072
00:58:37,207 --> 00:58:38,558
Okay, yes, yes.
Thank you for
verifying, Felice.

1073
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:39,791
You've been a huge help.

1074
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:41,749
- Yeah.
- Thank you, bye-bye.

1075
00:58:43,124 --> 00:58:44,374
That's right.

1076
00:58:46,374 --> 00:58:47,582
Yeah, I can hold.

1077
00:58:56,582 --> 00:58:59,415
Howard:
Bellmore Fine Auto,
this is Howard.

1078
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:03,707
Uh, I'm sorry.
Bellmore Fine Auto?

1079
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:07,791
I had this number listed
as an H.G. Consulting.

1080
00:59:24,332 --> 00:59:25,916
Pam: Hi.

1081
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:28,290
What's the matter?

1082
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,749
Oh, nothing,
I'm just, just tired.

1083
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:34,083
I'll take those invoices.

1084
00:59:43,374 --> 00:59:46,041
David:
Next up is WordPower Tech.

1085
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,749
Now, they billed
the school district $800,000

1086
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,874
but no one has any idea
who they are.

1087
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,165
And they're consistent.

1088
00:59:53,249 --> 00:59:55,332
They've billed every year
for the past ten.

1089
00:59:55,415 --> 00:59:57,999
Yeah, the company's registered
to Thomas Tuggiero

1090
00:59:58,083 --> 00:59:59,541
with an address in Manhattan.

1091
00:59:59,624 --> 01:00:02,041
I tried calling but the number
is disconnected.

1092
01:00:02,374 --> 01:00:04,624
We're gonna leave that one
a question mark for right now

1093
01:00:04,707 --> 01:00:08,415
because the next one I've got
is Porto Office Supplies.

1094
01:00:08,499 --> 01:00:10,999
Now, I can't find any...

1095
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:24,874
Man:
What, did you forget your key?

1096
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:27,916
Oh.

1097
01:01:28,582 --> 01:01:29,791
Hello.

1098
01:01:33,707 --> 01:01:35,249
Can I help you with something?

1099
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:36,916
Is this...

1100
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:40,582
Uh, I'm...

1101
01:01:40,999 --> 01:01:42,124
I'm canvassing.

1102
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:44,249
For who?

1103
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:50,749
Oh, um, it's...

1104
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,041
I'm, I have the wrong apartment.

1105
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,833
You're back.

1106
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:44,457
I'm back.
Hey, thanks.

1107
01:02:47,624 --> 01:02:48,833
Hey, what's for dinner?

1108
01:02:49,415 --> 01:02:50,874
Salmon.

1109
01:03:00,165 --> 01:03:01,791
What's the matter?

1110
01:03:03,332 --> 01:03:05,332
Oh, it's just work.
Sorry.

1111
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:09,041
The salmon's a little dry.

1112
01:03:10,124 --> 01:03:11,374
It's great.

1113
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,791
I can tell when you're lying.

1114
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:21,415
A little dry, maybe.

1115
01:03:21,499 --> 01:03:23,290
The couscous, though,
is a small masterpiece.

1116
01:03:23,374 --> 01:03:25,207
Oh, well, thank you very much.

1117
01:03:31,332 --> 01:03:32,541
How was Omaha?

1118
01:03:33,207 --> 01:03:35,999
Mm, dull.
Dull as all hell.

1119
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:40,290
So...

1120
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:43,624
So I'm sitting there
sandwiched between
Doug and Joe

1121
01:03:43,707 --> 01:03:45,916
and there's no A/C
in the conference center

1122
01:03:45,999 --> 01:03:47,958
so you can imagine
the smell while they...

1123
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:50,374
- Oh, God.
- Talked for hours

1124
01:03:50,457 --> 01:03:54,457
about STEM programs
and state aid.

1125
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:55,999
It was, oh, yeah.

1126
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:59,041
- It was, it was a riot.
- Oh, sounds like a nightmare.

1127
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:03,624
Maybe I'll come along next time.

1128
01:04:05,874 --> 01:04:07,249
As a buffer.

1129
01:04:10,374 --> 01:04:12,041
I would never
subject you to that.

1130
01:04:52,749 --> 01:04:55,124
Okay, you have documents
to back this up?

1131
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:57,707
Years' worth of supposed
payments to vendors

1132
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,041
and confirmation
they were never received.

1133
01:05:00,332 --> 01:05:02,207
Some of these companies,
they don't even exist.

1134
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,916
Well, no, you don't know that.

1135
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:06,707
I mean, you know
that for sure, right?

1136
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:07,999
WordPower Tech.

1137
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,850
They've billed the district
almost a million dollars

1138
01:05:09,874 --> 01:05:11,457
and no one knows anything.

1139
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:13,266
- Because it isn't anything.
- Okay.

1140
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,975
It is a private apartment
on the upper East Side.

1141
01:05:14,999 --> 01:05:16,999
- Yes, but that doesn't...
- And our superintendent

1142
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:19,124
- has the key.
- necessarily
mean that it's fake.

1143
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,791
Come on, Nick,
you know what this is.

1144
01:05:22,874 --> 01:05:25,374
If he hasn't reported this,
it's fraud.

1145
01:05:25,457 --> 01:05:27,666
He's writing my college
recommendation letter.

1146
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,999
Fuck, fuck, god damn it.

1147
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:37,999
What are we even
talking about right now?

1148
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:43,165
Are you sure?
Are you sure, sure, sure

1149
01:05:43,249 --> 01:05:44,833
you actually wanna do this?

1150
01:06:16,207 --> 01:06:17,624
Frank:
Mind if I join you?

1151
01:06:30,874 --> 01:06:32,154
Don't ever let a doctor find out

1152
01:06:32,207 --> 01:06:33,833
you have high
cholesterol, Rachel.

1153
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:36,041
They'll make you do
the most horrible things.

1154
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:41,707
So.

1155
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:43,916
About yesterday.

1156
01:06:44,707 --> 01:06:46,165
Yeah, uh...

1157
01:06:47,457 --> 01:06:49,374
- That was...
- What were you doing there?

1158
01:06:51,249 --> 01:06:52,499
I'm not upset.

1159
01:06:52,582 --> 01:06:55,374
But it is very important
that you be honest.

1160
01:06:57,457 --> 01:07:00,457
I was following up
on the listed address

1161
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,124
for a school contractor.

1162
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,916
Why were you doing that?

1163
01:07:06,582 --> 01:07:08,502
It's public record.
Anyone could take the time...

1164
01:07:08,582 --> 01:07:10,182
I didn't ask you
if it was public record.

1165
01:07:10,249 --> 01:07:11,958
I... I just asked you why.

1166
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,624
It's for something I'm writing.

1167
01:07:25,582 --> 01:07:27,332
I think you have real potential.

1168
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:29,415
- Dr. Tassone...
- No, I'm serious.

1169
01:07:29,499 --> 01:07:31,624
I, I read all your bylines.

1170
01:07:31,707 --> 01:07:33,627
You've come such a long way
since past September.

1171
01:07:33,707 --> 01:07:35,874
Your confidence,
strength of ability.

1172
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:37,643
- Thank you.
- No, you have a tremendous

1173
01:07:37,707 --> 01:07:39,249
future ahead of you,
Rachel, you do.

1174
01:07:39,332 --> 01:07:40,332
But...

1175
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,207
You're still young, too.
Which is why

1176
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,916
you need to know,
and I mean this,

1177
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:47,958
if you go public...

1178
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:51,041
with something you
don't fully understand,

1179
01:07:51,124 --> 01:07:53,833
it'll, it'll come back
on you hard.

1180
01:08:13,249 --> 01:08:14,624
I don't know, I...

1181
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,290
I guess it's our fault, mainly.

1182
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:20,041
We try to create
a safe environment

1183
01:08:20,124 --> 01:08:21,415
for students to...

1184
01:08:22,249 --> 01:08:25,165
challenge, take risks,
make mistakes, grow.

1185
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:28,999
But this mistake,
if you make it,

1186
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:31,290
we will not
be able to protect you.

1187
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:35,207
Not me, not your teachers.
Because it'll change everything.

1188
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:37,874
And a lot of innocent people
will get hurt.

1189
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:40,707
Right?

1190
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:42,916
I mean, these kinds of inquiries

1191
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:45,791
are, are... are like
setting off a grenade.

1192
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:49,290
There's fallout in the pursuit.

1193
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:51,415
In the frenzy.

Right...

1196
01:08:55,249 --> 01:08:56,833
You must know all about that.

1197
01:09:04,415 --> 01:09:06,207
It's not perfect, but it works.

1198
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:09,165
What we have here works.

1199
01:09:10,124 --> 01:09:11,707
I hope we can keep it that way.

Hey, Rachel.

Hey, Frank.

1211
01:10:16,332 --> 01:10:19,541
I've been doing some more
digging over the past week.

1212
01:10:20,374 --> 01:10:22,624
I'm... concerned...

1213
01:10:23,499 --> 01:10:25,207
with what I found.

1214
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:27,415
Okay, come in.

Look, now we don't
have receipts,

1216
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:35,249
but some of these vendors,
they're...

1217
01:10:38,624 --> 01:10:41,624
this Pam thing isn't
a question of $250,000

1218
01:10:41,707 --> 01:10:43,124
like we'd initially thought.

1219
01:10:44,999 --> 01:10:46,666
Well, okay, uh,

1220
01:10:46,749 --> 01:10:48,874
do you have any sense
of what the number might be?

1221
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,749
I mean, are we talking 500?

1222
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:53,541
Are we talking a million?

1223
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,725
I mean, Phil, work with me.
I can't do anything but just...

1224
01:10:55,749 --> 01:10:57,290
I don't know, I don't know.

1225
01:10:58,207 --> 01:11:00,457
You don't... okay, fine.
So...

1226
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:02,707
figure it out, all right?

1227
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,124
Work your numbers magic
and then,

1228
01:11:04,207 --> 01:11:06,916
let's the two of us deal
with it from there, okay?

1229
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,374
Thanks, Phil.

1230
01:11:09,457 --> 01:11:10,916
Well, there's something else.

1231
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:12,290
Yeah, yeah.

1232
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:16,457
A flight to London, Heathrow,
over winter break...

1233
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:17,821
- billed to...
- Yeah, that's me.

1234
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:19,433
That flight was for me,
for the Pell Conference.

1235
01:11:19,457 --> 01:11:20,749
You knew about the Pell.

1236
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:22,666
First class, Concorde jet.

1237
01:11:23,332 --> 01:11:25,290

I mean, look.

1238
01:11:25,374 --> 01:11:28,582
I don't book the flights.
That's always been Jenny's job.

1239
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:31,457
- But look, even if I had...
- The charge is for two seats.

1240
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:35,833
Two seats side by side in first.

1241
01:11:36,749 --> 01:11:39,499
It's $5,000 each way per ticket.

1242
01:11:39,582 --> 01:11:41,332
It's $20,000.

1243
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:44,833
Yeah, well, that sounds
like a mistake.

1244
01:11:46,207 --> 01:11:47,833
You know, I called the airline.

1245
01:11:52,165 --> 01:11:53,999
Who's Kyle Contreras?

1246
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:03,332
Wow.

1247
01:12:07,332 --> 01:12:10,207
Wow.
Okay, okay.

1248
01:12:11,541 --> 01:12:13,207
So that's how you wanna play it.

1249
01:12:13,874 --> 01:12:14,999
What, no.
I'm not playing...

1250
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:16,415
Frank:
I mean, the audacity.

1251
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,165
Coming from the man
who spent six months

1252
01:12:19,249 --> 01:12:22,457
falsifying our records
to mask his own negligence

1253
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,083
of fiduciary duty to the school.

1254
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:26,707
Wait a second, that's not what,
that's not what's going on.

1255
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:27,707
No, no?

1256
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:29,541
Pam didn't
have to happen, right?

1257
01:12:29,624 --> 01:12:31,833
You could have prevented that.
You're the auditor.

1258
01:12:32,374 --> 01:12:34,290
The people here
pay you for what?

1259
01:12:34,582 --> 01:12:37,083
So you can go off
and do your community theater

1260
01:12:37,165 --> 01:12:39,249
instead of taking care of
our school's books?

1261
01:12:40,207 --> 01:12:41,415
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1262
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:43,958
Oh, I can
point fingers too, Phil.

1263
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:46,249
Right, but I think we both agree

1264
01:12:46,332 --> 01:12:48,475
that that wouldn't be a very
productive use of our time.

1265
01:12:48,499 --> 01:12:50,249
- But...
- Phil.

1266
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,541
Are you gonna do your job,

1267
01:12:52,624 --> 01:12:55,083
or do I have to call Hevesi
in here himself

1268
01:12:55,165 --> 01:12:56,499
to come and do it for you?

1269
01:12:56,582 --> 01:12:58,249
Because I will call him
right now.

1270
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,541
I will deal with it.

1271
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:01,809
I'm sorry that I brought it up.
I shouldn't have.

1272
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,791
Yeah, damn right
you shouldn't have.

1273
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,415
Phil:
You won't hear about it again.

1274
01:13:07,374 --> 01:13:08,582
Good.

1275
01:13:10,624 --> 01:13:11,874
Get out of here.

1276
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,791
Hey, Dad, can I
ask you something?

1277
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:44,876
And you don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

1278
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:47,791
Yeah, you can ask me anything.

I mean, I know what you had
said at, at the time,

when, um,

1282
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:57,874
all that stuff was happening.

1283
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,165
The insider trading.

1284
01:14:02,457 --> 01:14:05,207
Did you really not know?

1285
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:09,624
Are you asking me
if I was a part of it?

1286
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:13,833
No, I wasn't.

1287
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:17,332
Not at any point in time,
I promise you.

1288
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:21,124
But, uh...

1289
01:14:22,999 --> 01:14:24,439
You gotta understand,
those were guys

Guys with families.
They were good people.

And it was all gonna
even out in the long run.

1294
01:14:36,499 --> 01:14:38,290
So who cares?

1295
01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:43,207
I didn't say anything.

1296
01:14:44,707 --> 01:14:46,083
I could have.

1297
01:14:46,874 --> 01:14:47,916
But I didn't.

So we were at dinner

1336
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:33,833
however many years ago.

1337
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:35,749
Uh, it was nowhere fancy.
It was...

1338
01:18:36,457 --> 01:18:38,374
a pizza place on Bell Boulevard.

1339
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:40,916
Two Greek salads
and a fountain drink.

1340
01:18:42,124 --> 01:18:44,916
And I fucked up, I used
the wrong card by accident.

1341
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:46,624
It's for $20.

1342
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:49,457
And I said, I'd even it
all out on Monday.

1343
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:51,290
I'd reimburse the school
out of pocket.

1344
01:18:51,374 --> 01:18:53,249
Whatever we had to do, you know.

1345
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:56,124
Monday came and went.

1346
01:18:57,916 --> 01:19:00,457
Nobody said anything.
Nobody, nobody cared.

1347
01:19:02,749 --> 01:19:05,624
On Tuesday,
it was a 60 cent bagel.

1348
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,165
Bob, if...

1349
01:19:07,249 --> 01:19:08,958
if I wanted the money...

1350
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:11,821
I would have gone
to Wall Street.

1351
01:19:11,874 --> 01:19:13,332
I'd be living in a big house

1352
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,666
in the country estates
like you, but...

1353
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:18,791
I wanted to make a difference.

1354
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:20,749
Right?

1355
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:23,332
I did, we did, look.

01:19:24,749 --> 01:19:26,124
We're number four.

1357
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,874
I got us all the way

1358
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,374

Come on, no.

Not now, no.

Not until the budget vote
goes through.

- Okay.

1408
01:22:26,457 --> 01:22:28,749
Good afternoon, Dr. Tassone.
How was your weekend?

1409
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,749
Good, I hope.
I'd like to talk to you today

1410
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:32,582
about the OMNI program
that you are running.

1411
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:35,415
Wait, I thought we already
discussed the subject
of OMNI last fall.

1412
01:22:35,499 --> 01:22:37,833
Oh, yeah, no, Militzok
gave him the make-up test

1413
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,308
but she made it harder
to spite him.

1414
01:22:39,332 --> 01:22:40,932
And no third grader
could pass that test.

1415
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:42,850
All right, well,
I guess I'll just
have to look into it.

1416
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:45,332
Chad, why don't you just
finish reading for Dr. Tassone?

1417
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:47,165
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

1418
01:22:48,124 --> 01:22:50,332
I very much hope that
you will still consider me

1419
01:22:50,415 --> 01:22:51,666
for this amazing program.

1420
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:54,290
I believe I am very bright

1422

- Ack...
- Okay, sound that out.

01:23:29,874 --> 01:23:32,874
- Chad: "Arrelicated"?
- Ac-celerated.

1437
01:23:36,874 --> 01:23:37,999
Okay.

1438
01:23:39,457 --> 01:23:41,124
Do you like race cars, Chad?

1439
01:23:42,499 --> 01:23:43,916
Yeah?
Okay.

1440
01:23:48,249 --> 01:23:49,582
Let's say you're in a racecar.

1441
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:51,415
All right, here,
you don't need that.

1442
01:23:54,374 --> 01:23:55,707
You're in a racecar.

1443
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,833
First place at the Indy 500

1444
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:01,749
with, with all the sponsorships
in the world.

1445
01:24:02,707 --> 01:24:05,083
The wind is in your hair
and you're feeling just great,

1446
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:08,083
and all of a sudden,
you feel this thing behind you

1447
01:24:08,165 --> 01:24:09,165
digging into your fender,

1448
01:24:09,249 --> 01:24:10,649
and you look
into the mirror, right.

1449
01:24:10,707 --> 01:24:12,725
And there's this hook.
There's a hook in your fender

1450
01:24:12,749 --> 01:24:15,374
dug in real good,
and it's connected to a...

1451
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:17,916
A long metal rope
and at the end of that rope

1452
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:20,582
is, well, it's a massive
five-ton cinder block.

1453
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:21,874
Okay, Chad?
All right?

1454
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:25,041
So your job is driving.
You're Dale Earnhardt

1455
01:24:25,124 --> 01:24:27,207
and here's this cinder block,
and all the other cars

1456
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:28,707
are soaring past you and

1457
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,207
you've gone from
first to last place

1458
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:31,725
and you keep thinking
to yourself, "What the hell

1459
01:24:31,749 --> 01:24:33,391
do I have to do to
get this thing off my back?"

1460
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:34,934
Well, I'll tell you, Chad.
It's real simple.

1461
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:37,707
You just put your foot
on the gas real hard

1462
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:40,207
and you accelerate,
you accelerate so fast

1463
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:43,207
that rope snaps in two,
the cinder block explodes,

1464
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,541
and just say it with me, Chad.

1465
01:24:44,624 --> 01:24:47,207
Accelerate.
Accelerate. Accelerate.

1466
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,999
- Chad: Accelerate?
- Yes.

1467
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:52,457
- Carol: Okay.
- Yes.

1468
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:55,290

is your problem, huh?

1469
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:57,457
My problem?

1470
01:24:59,582 --> 01:25:00,916
My problem is you.

1471
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:04,207
Carol, it's, it's,
it's the people who

1472
01:25:04,457 --> 01:25:07,374
who trot their poor children out
like racehorses at Belmont.

1473
01:25:07,457 --> 01:25:09,624
- Excuse me?
- Who derive some perverse joy

1474
01:25:09,707 --> 01:25:12,374
out of treating us like
low-level service reps.

1475
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:13,975
- Carol: Okay...
- I mean, do you remember

1476
01:25:13,999 --> 01:25:16,833
the teachers who sat with you,
who held you by the hand,

1477
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:18,582
- who taught you to add.
- Carol: No.

1478
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:20,582
And subtract,
or showed you Gatsby,

1479
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:22,916
Salinger for the first time.
"Mockingbird," even.

1480
01:25:22,999 --> 01:25:24,833
Do, do their names escape you?

1481
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:26,017
- Are their faces a blur?
- Okay.

1482
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:27,332
No, you listen to me!

1483
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:30,958
You don't wanna see us as people

1484
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:33,666
because that is not
convenient for you.

1485
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:36,999
You just
leave us behind at will.

1486
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:38,707
Never think about us again.

1487
01:25:39,124 --> 01:25:41,958
All right, you might forget,
but we don't.

1488
01:25:42,332 --> 01:25:45,165
We never forget, ever.

1489
01:25:48,582 --> 01:25:50,083
Chad:
What's wrong with him?

1490
01:25:50,165 --> 01:25:51,582
Carol:
You know what, I don't know.

1491
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:53,809
I don't think anything's wrong.
We're gonna get some food

1492
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:55,290
and we're gonna go home, okay?

1493
01:25:55,374 --> 01:25:57,041
- Chad: Mm-hmm.
- Carol: All right.

1494
01:25:58,332 --> 01:25:59,874

01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:53,833
You're going away
for a long time, Pam.

1501

it may not be too late
