If he's not out of there in an hour, call 911.

72
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,360
我就在這堣@直砸門
And I am banging down doors

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,700
直到有人

74
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,660
認真聽我說話  懂嗎

76
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,870
考試的時候她甚至都不讓他上廁所
She wouldn't even let him take a bathroom break

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,540
他有膀胱過動癥

78
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,380
查德  親愛的  告訴他你怎麼

-讓我們來...  -沒人肯聽我說話
- Let's, let's just... - No one will listen to me.

82
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,380
我不知道我還能怎麼辦
All right, I don't know what else I'm supposed to do.

83
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,220
查德  他和他同年級的學生一樣聰明
Chad, he is just as gifted as everyone else in his year.

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,290
-當然  -而且
- Absolutely. - And...

85
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,640
我很害怕  塔索內博士
I'm scared, Dr. Tassone,

86
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,040
因為如果他進不了實驗班
because if he doesn't get into OMNI...

87
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,310
覺得自己不如...
and he starts to think of himself as less than...

88
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,110
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

89
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,610
不  我會和米利措克老師談的
No, I will talk to Ms. Militzok.

90
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,260
我會把這事解決的
I will straighten this whole thing out.

91
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,950
-你會嗎  -我保證
- You will? - Yes.

92
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,410
然後我們可以讓查德補考一次
And, and we'll just set a make-up test for Chad.

93
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,100
給他足夠的時間上廁所
All right, with ample bathroom time.

94
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,700
謝謝您  塔索內博士
Thank you, Dr. Tassone.

95
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,330
您不知道我有多感激您
I can't tell you how much I appreciate that.

96
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,750
沒必要謝我  好嗎
There's no need to thank me, all right?

97
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,710
查德是個聰明的孩子  有大好的人生等著他
Chad's a smart kid with the world ahead of him,

98
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,650
而我們的工作就是給他鋪好跑道
and it's our job to give him the runway.

99
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,570
謝謝您
Thank you.

100
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,370
說起來很有意思
It's funny.

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,540
查德  我像你這麼大的時候
You know, Chad, when I was your age,

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,180
我都進不了數學高班
I didn't even place into fast track math.

103
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,850
-真的嗎  -真的  我搞不定乘法口訣
- Really? - No. I couldn't nail my times tables.

104
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,980
那時候我以為我完了
And at the time, I thought my world was ending.

105
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,130
但我後來趕上大家了  你猜怎麼樣
But I caught up. You know what?

106
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,680
現在數學課歸我管
Now I set the math curriculum.

107
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,240
感謝您  塔索內先生

so we came up with this idea, the SkyWalk.

135
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,530
它是一座連接學校兩端的橋樑
a bridge, to link the school from end to end.

136
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,380
這對我們來說是一項艱巨的任務
And um, it's a huge undertaking for us.

137
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,130
等明年五月這個計劃獲批
And we can't wait to break ground

138
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,620
我們會即刻動工的
once the plans are approved next May.

139
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,680
好極了  這就夠了  太感謝了
Great, that's all I need. Thank you so much.

140
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,520
這就夠了  你不需要後續問題嗎
That's it? No, no follow-ups?

141
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,960
不用  這就是篇拍馬屁的文章
No, it's just a puff piece.

142
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,090
他們把真正的報道留給高三學生寫了
They save the real stories for seniors.

143
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,550
蕾切爾
Rachel.

144
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,010
這不拍馬屁的文章  除非你決定這麼寫
It's only a puff piece if you let it be a puff piece.

145
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,390
西北大學也會這麼告訴你的
That's what they'll tell you over at Northwestern.

146
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,620
好嗎  一個真正的新聞工作者
All right? A real journalist

147
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,440
能把任何作業都寫成一篇報道
can turn any assignment into a story.

148
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,460
你在忙嗎  就一幫同事想向你道謝
Are you busy? Just a couple of colleagues want to convey thanks.

149
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,570
蕾切爾·巴爾加瓦  《山峰燈塔》的撰稿人
Rachel Bhargava, staff writer for the "Hilltop Beacon."

150
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,740
這位是鮑勃·斯派塞  學校董事會主席
This is Bob Spicer, school board president.

151
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,680
你是...
Oh, you're,

152
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,720
你跟我女兒貝卡一個年級對吧
You're in my daughter, Becca's year, right?

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,370
替我向你爸爸問好
Say hi to your dad for me.

154
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,470
很高興見到你  蕾切爾
Nice to meet you, Rachel.

155
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,750
如果還有問題  就和瑪麗·安約個時間  好嗎
And if you want to follow up, just set a time with Mary Ann, okay?

156
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,920
我等著看你的文章
And, uh, I'll be keeping an eye out for your byline.

157
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,690
需求量跟瘋了一樣  一飛沖天
The demand is insane. It's skyrocketing.

158
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,690
羅斯林高地的三室房
We're seeing three bedrooms go

159
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,110
要價超過一百萬
for over a million in Roslyn Heights.

160
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,990
是啊  賽奧西特和傑堿
Yeah, you just don't see those kinds of numbers

161
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,530
可看不到這種房價
in Syosset or Jericho.

162
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,580
沒錯  但那些鎮子離市塈騠
Right, but those towns are a further commute from the city.

163
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,080
曼哈西特和大頸也不行
Not Manhasset, not Great Neck.

164
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,540
重點是公立學校  學校越好
It's the public schools. The better the school system,

165
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,420
房價越高  就這麼簡單
the higher the price tag on the homes, period.

166
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,000
自從那本期刊上登了那篇報道
Our firm has sold nine separate lots in that area

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,340
我們公司已經在那婼璆X九塊地了
since the report in that journal came out.

168
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,250
這是一點心意
And, uh, here's a little something

169
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,490
-是大家的謝禮  -好吧
- you know, from all of us. - Okay.

170
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,450
天啊  這真是
Really, that's, oh.

171
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,260
-繼續保持吧  -謝謝大家
- Keep up the good work. - Well, thanks, everyone.

172
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,350
-塔索內博士  -對了
- Dr. Tassone? - Oh, yeah.

173
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,930
-你們介意合個影嗎  -沒問題
- Do you mind if we get a little... - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,480
-我會放我辦公室  -好極了
- Something for my office. - Great.

175
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,440
-我很感謝你們  -靠過來點  威爾
- I really appreciate you... - Scoot in, scoot in, Will.

176
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,880
今天來看我
...coming in today.

177
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,300
-謝謝你們  -好的
- Thank you. - Okay.

178
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,770
-好的  謝謝你們  -好的
- Okay, thank you. - Okay.

179
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,730
好了  讓他
All right? Yeah, let's let him...

180
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,570
-讓他回去工作吧  -謝謝
- Let him get back to work. - Thank you.

181
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,450
-真的很感謝你們  -好的
- No, I really appreciate it. - Yeah.

182
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,200
-非常感謝  -謝謝
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

183
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,060
好了
Okay.

184
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,410
我不能吃這些  麻煩你
I can't eat these. Just, if you put them out

185
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,400
把它們放外面讓大家隨便拿吧
for everybody to pick at, that'd be great.

186
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,690
他們沒有亞麻籽了
They were out of the flax seed.

187
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,070
沒關係  謝了
That's okay, that's okay. Thanks.

188
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,500
你覺得鮑勃那個職位大概能掙多少
How much do you figure a guy like Bob makes at his regular job?

189
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,120
你是說鮑勃·斯派塞嗎
Bob Spicer, you mean?

190
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,790
一年至少幾十萬
High sixes a year, minimum.

191
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,520
甚至可能超過百萬
Maybe seven figures in this market.

192
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,800
-怎麼了  -當我沒問
- Why? - Oh, forget it.

193
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,640
你看上去很累
You look tired.

194
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,930
也許你可以早點回家  休息一下
You might wanna go home early, get some rest.

195
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,270
我還得去聊狄更斯
I gotta run Dickens.

196
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,120
也許我可以試試退出
Maybe I'll try and bow out and

197
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,290
提早為這週末的維加斯之旅做好準備
get a headstart and early prep for Vegas this weekend.

198
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,750
-最好不要翹讀書俱樂部  -為什麼
- I wouldn't bail on book club. - Why?

199
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,960
那些女人喜歡你
Those women adore you,

200
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,860
而她們每人都有二十來個閨蜜
and each one talks to two dozen more.

201
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,400
距離下一次預算投票也就九個月了
The next budget vote's only nine months away.

202
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,840
-對  我們的天橋  -是啊  這是個大項目
- Right, our SkyWalk. - Yeah, the SkyWalk is big.

203
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,070
能讓我們排第一  這才是重點
Gets us to first. That's all that matters.

204
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,350
這個新的減肥食譜真夠我受的
This new diet is kicking my ass.

205
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,500
這到底是什麼
What is that, even?

206
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,680
估計是木炭之類的東西
It's got charcoal in it or something like that.

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,710
炭  是吧
Yeah, coal.

208
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,750
現在要是能來點碳水讓我殺人都行
I would kill somebody for a carb right now.

209
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,210
真不知道該上哪去找啊
I don't know where you could find one.

210
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,090
你真是賤死了
You are such a bitch.

211
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,550
怎麼  你想來一口嗎
Oh, would you like a bite?

212
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,450
-我討厭熏牛肉配黑麥麵包  -想咬一口嗎
- I hate pastrami on rye. - You want a bite?

213
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,990
我知道你不喜歡
Yeah, I know you hate it.

214
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,770
張嘴
Open up.

215
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,940
-太他媽的好吃了  -是吧
- Fucking so good. - Right?

216
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,350
再來一口嘛
Come on, you can eat more.

217
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,250
別這樣  再吃一口
You got... come on, one more bite.

218
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,580
-我要殺了你  -我不會告訴別人的
- I will kill you. - I won't tell anyone.

219
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,820
我誰都不會說的
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

220
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,610
你還在長身體
You're a growing boy.

221
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,410
快吃吧  別廢話了
Come on. Eat the fuckin' sandwich.

222
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,020
我們開始吧
Let's get started.

223
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,340
我們可以開始了嗎  大家
Should we get started, everyone?

224
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,800
聊聊我們對《馬丁·翟述偉》的看法吧
What do we all think of "Martin Chuzzlewit"?

225
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,720
好吧
Okay.

226
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,620
弗蘭克  不是所有人都對文化感興趣
You know, Frank, the culture is not for everyone.

227
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,160
我覺得我們最終還是
Eh, I thought we wound up having a

228
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,940
進行了一場不錯的討論
really good discussion, ultimately.

229
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,620
弗蘭克  我可以問你一個私人的問題嗎
Frank, can I ask you a personal question?

230
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,990
可以
Sure.

231
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,410
就是
It's just that...

232
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,660
喬納他
Jonah's...

233
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,850
非常接受不了分居的事
you know, having a really hard time with the separation.

234
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,040
是啊  你知道施拉克特老師
Yeah. You know, Ms. Schlacter,

235
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,050
告訴我他開始對《香蕉船》感興趣了
uh, told me that he's opened up a little bit in Banana Splits?

236
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
沒錯  是的  我的天吶
Right, yeah, oh, my God. Yeah.

237
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,850
-謝謝你的指引  -這是我應該做的
- Thank you for getting him in. - No, of course.

238
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,100
這一切對我們來說太難了  而且
It has been so hard on us, and...

239
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,890
你真的是
You have been...

240
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,540
幫了我們的大忙
such a tremendous help.

241
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,900
莎倫  別這麼說  我很樂意幫忙  隨時都可以
Oh, Sharon, of course. Anytime, anytime.

242
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,490
是啊  我...
Yeah, and...

243
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,720
-弗蘭克  抱歉  -沒關係  沒關係
- Frank, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no, no.

244
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,930
你想給你的兒子最好的安排
You want what's best for your son.

245
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,470
這沒有什麼好羞恥的
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

246
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,500
相反  它會讓你更堅強  只是
Uh, no, it makes you strong. It's, um...

247
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,580
我
I...

248
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,420
我覺得  到頭來
you know, I think at the end of the day,

249
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,710
她給我留下的回憶還是如此鮮活
her memory is still very fresh.

250
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,520
看見你我怎麼就一點都不吃驚呢
Somehow, I'm not surprised.

251
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,110
傑妮之前弄錯了幾份文件
Jenny screwed up some paperwork earlier.

252
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,330
我在給她善後
I'm saving her ass.

253
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,610
傑妮有個好姑媽
Jenny's got a good aunt.

254
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,690
狄更斯聊得怎麼樣了
How did Dickens go?

255
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,490
這周去的是莎倫·凱茨家
Well, it was Sharon Katz's place this week.

256
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,120
那個
And...

257
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,430
-我就知道  -我想我可能
- I knew it. - I, I think maybe

258
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,170
不該主動提出幫她洗碗
I shouldn't have offered to wash up.

259
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,880
可憐的女人
That poor woman.

260
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,380
她完全不是你的菜
She's nowhere near your type.

261
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,590
確實  完全不是
She's not, she's not.

262
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,440
-詹米森  -學術英語
- Jamieson. - Uh, Honors English.

263
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,070
-喜歡尼采  -很好
- Loves Nietzsche. - Very good.

264
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,930
迪詹納羅呢
Uh, DiGennaro?

265
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,100
迪詹納羅
Oh, DiGennaro.

266
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,230
社會研究
Social studies,

建築細節嗎
into construction specs?

304
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,060
他們讓我自由發揮  某種程度上
They're giving me free reign, more or less.

305
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,480

313
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,930
碾壓耶利哥和西奧賽特的理由
put Jericho and Syosset to shame.

314
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,810
而且它看起來很漂亮  也會讓我們的生活更輕鬆
And it'll look great and make all our lives easier.

318
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,780
還是說不在你手邊
Or are they not on you?

319
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,660
當然不在我手邊  都鎖在地下室
No, they're not on me. They're locked in the basement,

320
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,600
壓在一堆年鑒
lost in the annals of history.

321
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,980

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,550
這棟樓太老了  經常漏水
It's an old building. We get leaks every so often.

335
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,520
通常稍等一會就不漏了
It usually stops after, like, a minute.

488
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,810
我這樣做很久了
I've been doing this a long time.

489

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,770
我先失陪了  要去招待客人
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to play host.

494
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,600

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,710
山峰燈塔

496
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,960
我沒明白  這是什麼
I don't get this. What is this?

497
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,490
是你要的天橋報道
It's the SkyWalk piece you wanted.

對  這就是新聞報道

我們是個課外小組  是個
We're an extracurricular. We are a club

We have a certain finesse to the way we approach stories here.

511
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,150
要我說的話  也難以描述
A je ne sais quoi, if you will.

512
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,410
但不用擔心  你會掌握的
But don't worry, though. You're gonna get the hang of it.

513
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,690
創記錄的天橋被證實是一項昂貴的工程

514

這個孩子給了我的員工一個家庭住址
So this kid, he gives my guy a home address.

540
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,220
在西漢普敦
In Westhampton.

541
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,870
離羅斯林整整八十公里
Full 50 miles outside of Roslyn.

542
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,700
還是個家庭住址
And it's a home address.

543
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,300
所以我對自己說
You know? So I say to myself, I say,

544
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,040
"羅斯林學校的承包商
"What's a Roslyn school's contractor

545
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,280
為什麼會跑到塞爾登
"doing buying supplies

546
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,850
這麼遠的地方來買東西"
"all the way out in Selden for, anyway?"

547
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,930
不  我們不會的  我們不會的
No, we wouldn't, we wouldn't.

548
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,420
我們的物料都是批發購買的
We get our materials wholesale, anyway.

549
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,160
我們...我們會招標
We, we put out bids.

550
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,130
工具箱  淋浴頭  這都是家裝用的東西
Tool chest, shower heads. That's home improvement.

551
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,670
-不是學校用的東西  -沒錯  沒錯
- That's not school stuff. - That's right, right.

552
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,450
-說不通  鮑勃  -這位詹姆斯·麥卡登是誰
- It doesn't add up, Bob. - Who is this James McCarden

553
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,980
他為什麼會有羅斯林的公費卡
and why does he have a Roslyn expense card?

554
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,490
不知道  我都不認識姓麥卡登的
I don't know. I don't even know a McCarden.

555
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,080
羅斯林就沒有姓麥卡登的
There is no McCarden at Roslyn.

556
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,560
稍等  親愛的  帕姆·克雷莫納
Oh, hang on, honey, wasn't Pam Cremona

557
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,050
或者帕姆·格盧金  誰知道她姓什麼
or Gluckin or whatever she is,

558
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,850
她第一任丈夫是不是姓麥卡登
wasn't her first husband a McCarden?

559
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,120
拜託
Come on.

560
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,570
不可能  怎麼可能是帕姆·格盧金
No way. Pam Gluckin, of all people?

561
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,660
她要在杜恩路建一所房子
She's gonna have a house on Dune Road?

562
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,770
雪佛蘭科爾維特

563
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,660
-我們該怎麼說  -不  什麼都不用說
- What should we say? - No, there's nothing to say.

564
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,300
-收據就證明了一切  -好吧
- The receipts say everything. - Yeah, okay.

565
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,880
-但我們需要...  -好了  她就在你身後
- But we need to... - Okay, she's right behind you.

566
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,080
你好  帕姆
Hi, Pam.

567
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,640
我想感謝你們大家
And, uh, I want to thank you all

568
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,280
主動抽出自己的時間
for volunteering time out of your day

569
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,930
來和我交流  我很想
to speak with me. I would just

570
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,540
聽你們每個人說說希望在六年級
love to hear from each of you what you hope

571
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,220
達到什麼目標
to achieve in the sixth grade.

572
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,430
好  從你開始吧  海瑟
Yeah, let's start with you, Heather.

573
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,030
我想拿到全A的成績
I wanna get all A's and become

574
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,400
像我媽媽一樣成為一位心胸外科醫生
a cardiothoracic surgeon like my mom.

575
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,040
很好
Great, uh,

576
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,800
但是為了完成今天的任務
but just for the purposes of today...

577
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,000
你能不能...
if you could just...

578
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,150
-快來  -什麼
- Come. - What?

579
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,230
快點
Quick.

580
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,370
稍等  我馬上回來
One second. Okay, I'll be back.

581
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,110
協作  進取

582
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,050
成功  尊重

583
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,850
我們可能會被抓
We're vulnerable here.

584
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,050
她盜用了納稅人的三萬美元
She stole $30,000 in taxpayer money

585
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,750
這還只是付給一流五金的
and that's just between the Ace Hardware.

586
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,260
天知道還有誰有公費卡
Who knows who else got an expense card?

587
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,450
我和你說  我們在道德上有責任
I'm telling you, it's our moral responsibility

588
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,190
向鎮媮|報這件事  必須的
to report this to the town. We have to.

589
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,730
不  這是犯罪了
No, this is a criminal matter.

590
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,670
我們得報警  找聯調局
We've got to call the police, the FBI.

591
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,080
好的  我們的法律顧問說
Okay, that was our legal counsel.

592
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,850
他們建議我們上報
They do recommend we report.

593
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,230
很好  那就這麼定了
Great, okay, well then, that settles it.

594
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,680
我要打給市長
I'm gonna call the mayor.

595
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,720
弗蘭克  你要一起來打電話嗎
Frank, you wanna be on that call?

596
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,330
對不起  對不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

597
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,380
快來人  給他倒杯水
Go get him, get him a glass of water.

598
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,050
我應該發現這件事的  我應該檢查的
I should have caught this. I should have checked.

599
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,900
帕姆在這比我的資歷還深
Pam's been here longer than I have.

600
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,230
我都沒想過
I didn't even think.

601
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,250
不  不  不  弗蘭克  這...這不是你的錯
No, no, no, no, Frank. It's... it's not your fault.

602
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,310
她花了十年在我們所有人心中都建立了信任
She built up a decade's worth of trust with all of us.

603
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,210
我們都被蒙蔽了
We were asleep at the wheel.

604
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,210
謝謝
Thank you.

605
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,260
但在我們進一步行動之前  需要...
But before we go any further, we need to,

606
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,750
需要瞭解目前的情況
we need to know what we're dealing with.

607
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,610
菲爾在我辦公室  正在計算確切的數字
I have Phil in my office getting a firm number.

608
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,310
菲爾  我們的審計員
Phil, our auditor?

609
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,700
這個人應該被解雇
The man should be fired.

610
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,140
他是唯一一位應該有所察覺的人
He's the one person who should have caught wind of this.

611
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,520
-蠢貨  -好吧
- Prick. - Okay.

612
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,760
我們不能操之過急
We can't jump the gun here.

613
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,700
尤其是在這麼危急的情況下  好吧
Not when there's this much at stake, all right?

614
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,800
-我們能...  -好吧
- Can we... - Okay.

615
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,230
我們給他一小時時間
We'll give him an hour.

616
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,810
-但在這之後...  -好的
- That's... But then, after that... - Right.

617
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,310
-我們就得上報了  -好的
- we start making calls. - Right.

618
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,390
吉姆小子做事怎麼能
How could Jim Boy be so careless,

619
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,860
這麼不小心
going around like that?

620
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,340
裝修肯定不能讓他干了
I'm pulling him off the remodel, that's for sure.

621
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,920
這下得去找個正經包工頭了
Just gonna have to hire on a real contractor.

622
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,260
-專業人士  -嗯  帕姆
- A professional. - Yeah, Pam?

623
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,350
不不不  弗蘭克能擺平這事
No, no, no. Frank's gonna fix this.

624
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,300
他知道我對學校來說有多重要
He knows how important I am to this school.

625
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,430
是我在維持這堛犒B轉  明白嗎
I'm the one who keeps the lights on here, you know?

626
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,740
-他會告訴他們的  -你覺得會有人
- He'll tell 'em. - Do you think anybody

627
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,130
發現那台索尼遊戲機的事嗎
could ever find out about the PlayStation?

628
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,800
不會  我跟你說過我做平了
No, I told you I took care of that.

629
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,580
你完全不用擔心
You have nothing to worry about there.

630
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,710
那就好
That's good.

631
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,440
因為...
It's just, um...

632
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,650
我...
I, uh...

633
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,420
我週末可能還提前買了些
I might have also done a little early Christmas shopping

634
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,940
聖誕禮物
over the weekend, too.

635
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,420
我本來想等過完節再告訴你的
See, I wasn't gonna mention until after the holiday

636
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,930
因為我給你買了禮物
because I bought you something,

637
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,150
我不想毀了驚喜
and I didn't, I didn't wanna spoil it.

638
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,370
我發誓  我發誓  我打算把錢還上的
I swear, I swear, I was gonna reimburse it all.

639
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,010
多少錢
How much?

640
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,990
不多  那個...
Not much, you know. Just like, um...

641
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,660
大概...
maybe...

642
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,980
在羅德與泰勒百貨花了1600
$1,600 at Lord & Taylor and...

643
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,090
在梅西百貨花了1200
another 12 at Macy's.

644
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,030
弗蘭克能擺平這事
Frank's gonna fix this.

645
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,080
跟我匯報  菲爾
Give me good news, Phil.

646
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,460
這不可能  絕對不可能
There's no way. There's, there's no way.

647
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,920
有支票不見了
There's check warrants that are missing.

648
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,610
購買記錄  我相信了她的話
Purchase orders. I took her word for it.

649
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,950
她每次都有說法  讓我不用擔心
She would tell me one thing, she'd say don't worry about it,

650
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,520
我就像個蠢貨一樣信了她鬼話
and I believed her like the fucking idiot schmuck I am.

651
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,460
我從沒想過要檢查核實
Oh, I never even think to check up, to validate.

652
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,580
我要丟工作了  我們的事務所完蛋了
I'm gonna lose my job. I'm gonna lose our firm.

653
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,010
-我們死定了  他們會殺了我們  -等等  等等
- We're dead, they'll kill us. - Hey, hey, no, no, no...

654
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,720
沒人要殺人  菲爾  看著我的眼睛
Nobody's killing anybody. Phil, look me in the eye.

655
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,990
看著我的眼睛
Look me in the eye.

656
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,950
這塈A說了算  跟我重複
You're running the show here. Say it after me.

657
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,470
"這塈睇﹞F算"
"I am running the show."

658
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,300
-這塈睇﹞F算  -很好
- I am running the show. - Good.

659
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,370
振作點
Pull it together.

660
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,530
你具體發現少了多少錢
How much did you find concretely?

661
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,630
二十二萬零三千
Two hundred twenty-three.

662
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,160
具體金額  但這只是最明顯的部分
Concretely, but that's just the obvious stuff.

663
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,590
-誰知道還有多少...  -223000
- Who knows what else is buried... - $223,000.

664
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,540
好的  好的
Okay, okay.

665
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,560
我們就咬定這個金額
That's our number.

666
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,590
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

667
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,770
我們就跟董事會說這個金額  223000
That's the number we go back to the board with, 223.

668
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,210
不  你沒聽明白
No, you're not hearing me.

669
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,780
這可能只是冰山一角
That might just be the tip of the iceberg.

670
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,410
-你又不能確定  -弗蘭克
- Well, you don't know that. - Frank.

671
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,320
收據都不見了
The receipts are gone.

672
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,910
估計都進了碎紙機
They're in the bin of a shredder, probably.

673
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,450
可能是被她弄丟了
She could have misplaced them.

674
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,020
現在有個非常現實的可能性
I mean, there's a very real scenario here

675
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,260
其它所有支出可能都是正當的  對吧
where all the other expenses are legit, right?

676
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,650
-也許吧  我說不好  -菲爾  菲爾
- Maybe, I don't know. - Okay, Phil, Phil.

677
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,520
她又不是什麼犯罪大師
She's not some criminal mastermind.

678
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,160
帕姆是我們的朋友
All right, Pam is our friend,

679
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,230
她犯了個愚蠢的錯誤
and she has made a stupid mistake.

680
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,000
但是...
But what...

681
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,960
州審計長那邊怎麼辦
but what about the state comptroller?

682
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,810
海韋希隨時可以
Hevesi could barge into this office

683
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,800
闖進這間辦公室  進行外部審計
at any given moment, conduct an outside audit.

684
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,930
你工作了三十年  他有這麼做過嗎
Has he ever done that once in your 30 years of experience?

685
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,910
正是如此
Exactly.

686
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,020
你就
Just...

687
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,860
告訴我一個金額  然後
give me a number, and...

688
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,670
我來擺平董事會
I'll take care of the board.

689
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,290
好了  各位
Okay, okay, everyone.

690
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,670
那個
So, the, uh...

691
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,450
總額是二十五萬美元
the sum total is $250,000.

692
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,990
-什麼  -老天  開什麼玩笑
- What? - Jesus, are you kidding me?

693
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,290
-那女人可真有種  -我們...
- That woman has a set of balls on her. - We can just...

694
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,100
-我要讓她好看  -你沒機會了
- When I get my chance. - You never will.

695
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,030
拿索警方會處理她的
She's gonna be Nassau PD's for the taking.

696
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,410
-還有她那個混蛋兒子  -不不不
- And that shitbird son of hers. - No, no, no, no, no.

697
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,330
-不不不  鮑勃  -好了  我們得走正當途徑
- No, no, no, Bob. - Okay, all right, let's do this right.

698
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,380
-把手機放下  鮑勃  -為什麼
- Put the phone away, Bob. - And why should he?

699
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,980
因為我們會失去一切的
Because we will lose everything.

700
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,690
什麼意思  弗蘭克
What do you mean, Frank?

701
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,400
一旦帕姆這事傳出去
Once word gets out about Pam,

702
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,170
我們就是請《紐約時報》  《新聞日報》
we're inviting "The Times," "Newsday,"

703
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,120
以及三州地區的所有報紙
and every other paper in the tri-state area

704
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,560
-來上門報道  -恕我直言
- to our front door. - With all due respect,

705
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,920
去他的報紙  這事真真切切的犯罪
screw the papers. This is a very real crime here.

706
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,360
偷竊納稅人的錢
A theft of taxpayer money.

707
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,820
朱迪  你在學校董事會
Judy, you've served on the school board

708
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,010
工作多久了  七年
for how long, seven years?

709
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,960
-八年  我很自豪  -好的  在這八年間
- Eight, proudly, - Okay, and in eight years,

710
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,900
納稅人多少次順利通過了
how many times has our budget been passed

711
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,390
我們的預算
by taxpayers without incident?

712
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,000
-八次  -沒錯
- Eight. - Right.

713
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,570
那等五月份我們提出下一年預算的時候
So what happens when our next budget goes up

714
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,880
會是什麼情況
for approval in May?

715
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,680
我們努力了一整年的預算
The budget that we've worked all year on.

716
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,570
能幫我們通過天橋項目的經濟刺激
The stimulus that gets us the SkyWalk.

717
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,890
能幫我們登上第一的項目  會怎麼樣
That gets us to first. What happens?

718
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,620
我明白他的意思
I get what he's saying.

719
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,800
輿論會怎麼說
I mean, how's it going to look?

720
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,230
一個學校員工能偷竊
A school employee is able to take

721
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,380
數十萬美元的公款
hundreds of thousands of dollars from the coffer

722
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,520
而不被發現
without anyone noticing.

723
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,410
我們為什麼還要繼續給學校撥款
Why would we pump more money into the school system?

724
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,230
沒錯  如果這種重大醜聞傳出去
Right, if a scandal this seismic breaks,

725
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,710
我們的預算就完了
I mean, our budget is torpedoed, done.

726
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,230
我們得重頭開始了
We are right back to square one.

727
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,940
我不知道  到時候就開不出工資了
I don't know, you can't pay the teachers.

728
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,950
也許教員會跳槽
Maybe they start migrating out.

729
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,800
這不會影響到大學吧
This can't affect the colleges, huh?

730
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,090
我們得準備好  頂尖學校的
I think we'd have to expect that admissions

731
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,480
招生官對我們的看法
at top-tier schools would view us

732
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,990
可能會徹底改變
under a radically different lens, yeah.

733
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,750
不  等等  為什麼
No, wait, what, what, why would they ever?

734
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,150
如果他們察覺到有麻煩  那他們
If they smell trouble, then they...

735
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,100
說不好  他們可能暫時不考慮羅斯林的學生
I don't know, they might decide to lay off Roslyn kids for a while.

736
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,790
"錄取"可能一夜之間變成"拒絕"
"Yeses" can become "Nos" overnight.

737
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,590
我聽說過有先例
I've-I've heard of that happening before.

738
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,710
真的  總之  我們先...
I have. So anyway, let's just...

739
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,020
先設想一下  好嗎
let's tease this out, okay?

740
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,280
我們的錄取率不佳  排名下滑
We don't perform, we go down in the rankings.

741
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,270
然後我們的姐妹學校
And then our sister schools

742
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,930
把我們擠出前十  前一百
nose us out of the top ten, top hundred.

743
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,710
賽奧西特和傑堿  那幫混蛋
Syosset and Jericho, those sons of bitches.

744
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,890
那時候我們就會看到
And that's when we start seeing

745
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,960
房價受到負面影響
property values adversely affected.

746
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,340
他說的對  當然是對的
He's right. Of course he is.

747
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,480
就房地產來說
As far as real estate,

748
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,230
尤其是在長島
especially Long Island,

749
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,240
房價直接跟
a town is only as good as its...

750
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,760
公立學校的水平掛鉤
Public school system.

751
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,880
我們付出了那麼多努力  對吧
After everything we've worked for, huh?

752
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,010
那麼多年的努力才達到現在的程度
Years that it's taken to, to, to get this far.

753
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,340
這事關係到我們的孩子
These are our kids we're talking about.

754
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,790
我有另一個辦法
I can think of one other option.

755
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,360
弗蘭克
Frank.

756
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,360
都會好起來的  帕姆
Everything's gonna be okay, Pam.

757
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,640
我們很快就讓你回家陪家人
We're, we're gonna get you home to your family real soon.

758
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,000
好了  把門關上
We're good, close the door.

759
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,620
董事會非常清楚你為學校
The board is very aware of how hard you worked

760
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,550
為羅斯林  為他們的孩子付出了多少努力
for the schools, for Roslyn, for their kids.

761
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,020
他們知道你一直是得力干將
They know what an asset you've been, and, um...

762
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,390
所以他們明白這是怎麼回事
that is why they see this for-for what it is.

763
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,660
一時糊塗
A lapse in judgment.

764
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,310
鑒於此  他們決定
And in light of that, they're opting

765
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,550
不提出指控  也不報警
not to press charges or involve the police.

766
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,640
謝謝  謝謝你們大家
Thank you, thank you. All of you.

767
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,200
你要全額賠償學校
So you'll make full restitution to the school

768
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,580
二十五萬美元
at the sum of $250,000.

769
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,470
二十五萬  全額賠償  沒問題
250, full... full restitution, of course.

770
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,600
我會想辦法的
I'll, I'll make it happen.

771
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,990
然後你要完成本周的工作
And then you'll finish out the work week

772
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,540
並低調辭職
and resign quietly.

773
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,390
等一下
Wait.

774
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,550
-什麼  -明白嗎
- What? - Okay.

775
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,670
明天一早你要
Tomorrow morning, you'll surrender

776
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,070
把管理執照交給董事會
your administrators license to the board

777
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,970
簽署一份保密協議  承諾...
and you'll sign an NDA committing...

778
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,200
弗蘭克  弗蘭克  我不明白這是怎麼回事
Frank, Frank, I don't... I don't understand what's happening.

779
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,690
我不明白  你在說什麼...
I don't understand this. Why are you...

780
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,520
你偷了學校的錢  帕姆
You stole from the schools, Pam.

781
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,890
偷了納稅人的錢
From, from the taxpayers.

782
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,330
偷了我們應該服務的孩子的錢
From, from the kids we're supposed to serve.

783
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,240
這種...
I mean, this...

784
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,620
這種行為不只是不道德了
kind of behavior goes beyond the bounds of immoral.

785
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,530
是殘酷
It, it's, it's cruel, it's...

786
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,820
簡直令人髮指  甚至可以說是精神病
It's heinous. It's, it's sociopathic, even.

787
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,230
什麼  精神病
Sociopathic, what?

788
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,960
無恥的利己主義
The shameless self-interest.

789
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,900
不穩定的性格
The, the, the unstable personality.

790
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,410
張揚的婚姻鬧劇
The parade of rotten marriages, it...

791
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,890
弗蘭克
Frank.

792
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,900
你需要幫助  帕姆
Look, you need help, Pam.

793
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,050
真正的醫療幫助
Real medical help.

794
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,790
你病了
You're a sick woman.

795
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,080
我們很擔心你  帕姆
We're concerned about you, Pam.

796
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,270
我
I am...

797
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,920
我病了
I'm a sick woman.

798
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,100
我
I'm...

799
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,160
為我的行為感到羞恥  為我自己感到羞恥
I'm ashamed of my actions. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm...

800
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,400
我沒有任何借口
There's no excuse for it.

801
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,640
精神病算是借口
Well, the sociopathy.

802
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,800
-好吧  鮑勃  -是的
- Yeah, Bob, the... - Yeah.

803
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,200
好的
Okay.

804
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,440
我們明天一早就把一切安排好

帕姆·格盧金

00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,530
剛剛是搞什麼鬼
What the hell was that?

813
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,730

818
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,930
我沒想到你會打來
I wasn't sure you were gonna call.

819
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,340

你媽媽今天丟了工作
Your mother lost her job today.

840
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,160

I don't get it, can't you just get a different job

842
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,290
找份其它工作嗎
at another school?

843
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,820
他們要沒收我的執照
They're taking my license.

844
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,620
媽媽  你做了什麼
Mom, what did you do?

845

846
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,360
對  我偷錢  我們都偷了

Okay, look, just go back to your rooms, please.

848
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,680

849

你的車  你的衣服
Your car, your clothes.

850
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,050
這房子  另一個房子
This house, the other houses.

851
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,580
-你在說什麼  -你不想去州立學校
- What are you talking about? - You didn't want state school.

852
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,820
你想去上私立大學
You wanted private college.

853
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,450
我希望你對我滿意

你總會找到工作的  我只是說
You'll find something. I'm just saying...

860

-我有學位  -我懂

861

我上了那麼多年學才拿到學位
I went to school for years to get degrees.

862
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,970
我開過校車  我做過速記
I drove the bus. I did the steno pool.

863
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,570

865

你是我認識的最聰明的女人
You are the smartest woman I have ever known.

866
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,540
我們會度過這個困難
We're gonna get through this and you're gonna

867
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,550
你會重振旗鼓的
land on your feet, you will.

868
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,110
過來
Come here.

869
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,320
-霍華德  -我懂

我懂
I know.

872
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:33,200
羅斯林高中

873
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,160
格盧金夫人
Mrs. Gluckin.

874
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,250
我想問下
I was just wondering.

875
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,500
能再給我一次地下室的鑰匙嗎
Could I get the key to the basement again?

876
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,730
我就想再查一點東西
I just want to look up a few more things.

877
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,040
你要做什麼  瑞秋
What's this for, Rachel?

878
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,600
我想確認一些東西
Just for some stuff I wanted to verify.

879
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,560
我可以回答你的問題
I can answer your questions.

880
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,520
好吧
Okay, well...

881
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,050
我算了下  天橋項目似乎
I did the math, and it looks like the SkyWalk

882
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,510
總共要花費八百萬美元
is gonna end up costing around eight million dollars.

883
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,350
-七百五十萬  當然  -對
- Seven-five, sure. - Right.

884
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,640
我們似乎要在美觀問題上
It just seems like a lot of our resources

885
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,650
投入大量資源
to be spending on cosmetics.

886
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,830
美觀  大家都喜歡天橋
Cosmetics? People love the SkyWalk.

887
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,460
《山峰燈塔》喜歡天橋項目
"The Beacon" loves the SkyWalk.

888
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,060
你們發起了投票
There was that nice poll you guys did.

889
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,890
對
Right.

890
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:24,260
但這所高中的天花板還在漏水
But the ceilings at the high school are still leaking.

891
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,290
有一些教室被迫關閉
I mean, some of the classrooms had to get shut down.

892
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,300
那麼你也許應該在
Sounds like you should bring that up

893
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,810
學生會上提起這個
with your student government.

894
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,380
還有那個披薩烤箱
There was also the pizza oven.

895
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,390
-什麼  -我在費用報表
- What? - I saw a line item

896
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,170
看到了一行披薩烤爐的支出記錄
in the expense reports for a pizza oven.

897
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,000
但我之後問了食堂的寶拉
But then I asked Paula in the cafeteria

898
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,380
她說她完全不知道有這回事
and she said she knew nothing about it.

899
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,900
別說了
Just stop it.

900
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,510
很抱歉我得告訴你這個
I am sorry to be the one to tell you this,

901
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,460
但沒人對你們有所隱瞞  好嗎
but no one is keeping anything from you, okay?

902
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,970
相反  我們每天天一亮就來這
On the contrary, we come in here every day

903
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,440
是因為我們關心你們
at the crack of dawn because we care.

904
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,270
我們希望能給你們提供
We care about providing you

905
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,000
良好的高質量教育  因為我們是好人
with a proper quality education because we're good people.

906
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,430
因為我們希望你們能過上好日子
Because we want you to have a good life.

907
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,440
好嗎
Okay?

908
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,690
好
Okay.

909
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,250
好
Okay.

910
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:18,140
但消費記錄仍然屬於公開數據
The individual purchase orders are still public record, though.

911
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,190
給
Here you go.

912
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,190
謝謝
Thank you.

913
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,140
另外瑞秋
Oh, and Rachel.

914
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,490
那個披薩烤箱的事你說對了
You were right about that pizza oven.

915
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,340
不是買給高中的
It didn't go to the high school

916
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,840
因為我們是給初中買的
because we bought it for the middle school.

917
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,530
對  他們吃了好幾天披薩了
Yeah, they have pizza for days down there.

918
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,190
你也去吃一塊
Go get yourself a slice.

919
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,120
早安
Morning.

920
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,110
-你好  -瑞秋
- Hi. - Oh, hey, Rachel.

921
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,790
塔索內博士  帕姆·格盧金狀態不太好
Dr. Tassone, Pam Gluckin's in a bit of a state.

922
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,150
我早上很忙
Yeah, I have a very busy morning.

923
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,990
跟她說我沒時間見她  早安
Just tell her I can't. Good morning.

924
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,500
弗蘭克  弗蘭克  弗蘭克
Frank, Frank, Frank!

925
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,260

926
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,560
抱歉  塔索內博士今早很忙
I'm sorry, Dr. Tassone's very busy this morning.

927
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,610
別擋道  瑪麗·安
Get out of my way, Mary Ann.

928
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:14,980
-帕姆  帕姆  -拜託
- Pam, Pam. - Please.

929
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,100
算了  沒事
You know what? It's fine.

930
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,280
什麼事都沒有
Everything's fine.

931
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,130
這是我留給他的離職談話
My exit interview for him.

932
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,380
塔索內博士
Hey, Dr. Tassone.

933
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,360
瑪麗·安說你想見我
Mary Ann said you wanted to see me?

934
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,790
對  請坐
Yes, yes. Uh, take a seat.

935
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,830
把門關上
Just close the door behind you there.

936
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,830
我想
So, I think maybe

937
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,450
我們該討論一下
it is time that we talked about your value

938
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,260
你在這堛漱u作價值了
in this workplace.

939
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,260
我
I, uh...

940
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,670
-這不是  -不  請安心

01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:17,260
紐約  B站台

1077
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,030
怎麼  你忘帶鑰匙了嗎
What, did you forget your key?

1078
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,220
你好
Hello.

1079
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,110
有什麼事嗎
Can I help you with something?

1080
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,810
這堿O不是
Is this...

1081
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,520
我
I'm...

1082
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,260
我在做民意調查
I'm canvassing.

1083
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:43,990
為誰做
For who?

1084
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,720
是...
It's...

1085
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,570
我找錯公寓了
I'm, I have the wrong apartment.

1086
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,930
你回來了
You're back.

1087
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:44,710
我回來了  謝謝
I'm back. Hey, thanks.

1088
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,890
晚餐吃什麼
Hey, what's for dinner?

1089
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,360
三文魚
Salmon.

1090
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,870
怎麼了
What's the matter?

1091
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,650
只是工作的事  抱歉
Oh, it's just work. Sorry.

1092
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,060
三文魚有點柴
The salmon's a little dry.

1093
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,420
很好吃
It's great.

1094
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,100
我能看出你在撒謊
I can tell when you're lying.

1095
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,700
可能是有點柴
A little dry, maybe.

1096
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,550
但粗麥粉真是絕味
The couscous, though, is a small masterpiece.

1097
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,590
謝謝誇獎
Oh, well, thank you very much.

1098
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,850
在奧馬哈如何
How was Omaha?

1099
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:36,260
無聊  無聊透頂
Dull. Dull as all hell.

1100
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:40,220
於是
So...

1101
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,810
我夾在道格和喬之間
So I'm sitting there sandwiched between Doug and Joe

1102
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:46,060
會議中心沒開空調
and there's no A/C in the conference center

1103
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,190
你能想像得到那股臭味
so you can imagine the smell while they...

1104
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,030
天啊
Oh, God.

1105
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:54,570
他們花幾個小時聊理工科項目和國家補助
...talked for hours about STEM programs and state aid.

1106
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,140
那真是
It was, oh, yeah.

1107
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:59,390
-那真是糟透了  -聽起來像個噩夢
- It was, it was a riot. - Oh, sounds like a nightmare.

1108
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:04,210
或許下次我該一起去
Maybe I'll come along next time.

1109
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,440
給你擋一擋
As a buffer.

1110
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,510
我絕不會讓你去受那種罪
I would never subject you to that.

1111
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,350
你有佐證的文件嗎
Okay, you have documents to back this up?

1112
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,950
多年來給供應商的付款記錄
Years' worth of supposed payments to vendors

1113
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,330
和供應商未收到錢的證明
and confirmation they were never received.

1114
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,430
這堶惘釭漱膝q甚至不存在
Some of these companies, they don't even exist.

1115
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,230
你不能確定這點
Well, no, you don't know that.

1116
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:06,870
我的意思是你確定嗎
I mean, you know that for sure, right?

1117
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,030
言辭力量科技公司
WordPower Tech.

1118
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,960
他們給學區開過近百萬美元的發票
They've billed the district almost a million dollars

1119
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,800
但沒人知道它
and no one knows anything.

1120
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,330
-因為它並不存在  -好吧
- Because it isn't anything. - Okay.

1121
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,250
那是上東區的一間私人公寓
It is a private apartment on the upper East Side.

1122
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,350
-是  但那不能  -我們的主管
- Yes, but that doesn't... - And our superintendent

1123
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,320
-有那堛瘋_匙  -完全證明公司是假的
- has the key. - ...necessarily mean that it's fake.

1124
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,040
承認吧  尼克  你明白的
Come on, Nick, you know what this is.

1125
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,700
如果他沒有舉報  那就是詐騙
If he hasn't reported this, it's fraud.

1126
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,890
他在寫我的大學推薦信
He's writing my college recommendation letter.

1127
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:35,500
操  操  操他媽的
Fuck, fuck, god damn it.

1128
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,910
我們現在在說什麼啊
What are we even talking about right now?

1129
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,350
你確定嗎  你百分百確定
Are you sure? Are you sure, sure, sure

1130
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:45,240
要這麼做嗎
you actually wanna do this?

1131
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,790
預算調查揭露重大瀆職嫌疑

1132
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:17,690
我可以坐這兒嗎
Mind if I join you?

1133
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,360
千萬別讓你的醫生發現
Don't ever let a doctor find out

1134
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:34,040
你膽固醇過高  蕾切爾
you have high cholesterol, Rachel.

1135
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,300
他們會逼你做很可怕的事情
They'll make you do the most horrible things.

1136
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:41,600
那麼
So.

1137
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,230
關於昨天
About yesterday.

1138
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,510
-那是  -你在那幹什麼
- That was... - What were you doing there?

1139
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,580
我沒有生氣
I'm not upset.

1140
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:55,790
但你一定要實話實說
But it is very important that you be honest.

1141
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,770
我在調查學校承包商的
I was following up on the listed address

1142
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,600
登記地址
for a school contractor.

1143
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,150
你為什麼要做這些
Why were you doing that?

1144
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,610
那是公開記錄  任何人都可以花時間
It's public record. Anyone could take the time...

1145
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,260
我沒問你那是不是公開記錄
I didn't ask you if it was public record.

1146
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,210
我問你為什麼
I... I just asked you why.

1147
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,760
是為了我在寫的文章
It's for something I'm writing.

1148
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,570
我覺得你很有潛力
I think you have real potential.

1149
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,500
-塔索內博士  -不  我是認真的
- Dr. Tassone... - No, I'm serious.

1150
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,840
我讀過你所有的報道
I, I read all your bylines.

1151
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,940
你比去年九月進步了很多
You've come such a long way since past September.

1152
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,180
你的自信和強大的能力
Your confidence, strength of ability.

1153
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,640
-謝謝  -你的前途非常光明
- Thank you. - No, you have a tremendous future ahead of you,

1154
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,470
真的  蕾切爾
Rachel, you do.

1155
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:40,670
但是
But...

1156
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,470
你還是太年輕
You're still young, too.

1157
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:46,370
這也是為什麼你要知道  我是認真的
Which is why you need to know, and I mean this,

1158
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,240
如果你公開了
if you go public...

1159
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,250
一些你不完全瞭解的事情
with something you don't fully understand,

1160
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,160
你會自食其果的
it'll, it'll come back on you hard.

1161
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,900
我不知道
I don't know, I...

1162
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,420
我想這主要是我們的錯
I guess it's our fault, mainly.

1163
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,710
我們試圖創造一個安全的環境  讓學生們
We try to create a safe environment for students to...

1164
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:25,500
去挑戰  冒險  犯錯  成長
challenge, take risks, make mistakes, grow.

1165
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,170
但如果你犯了這個錯誤
But this mistake, if you make it,

1166
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:31,490
我們無法保護你
we will not be able to protect you.

1167
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:35,700
我不行  你的老師們不行  因為這會改變一切
Not me, not your teachers. Because it'll change everything.

1168
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:38,350
很多無辜的人會受到傷害
And a lot of innocent people will get hurt.

1169
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,730
明白嗎
Right?

1170
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:43,220
我的意思是  這些調查
I mean, these kinds of inquiries

1171
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:46,200
就像引爆一枚手榴彈
are, are... are like setting off a grenade.

1172
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,480
瘋狂追求真相會造成後果
There's fallout in the pursuit. In the frenzy.

1173
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,520
會殃及池魚
There's collateral damage.

1174
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,170
對吧
Right...

1175
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,080
你一定清楚這些
You must know all about that.

1176
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,420
雖然不完美  但有成效
It's not perfect, but it works.

1177
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,510
我們現有的制度很有成效
What we have here works.

1178
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:12,070
我希望我們能保持下去
I hope we can keep it that way.

1179
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,310
我們來看看這個  蕾切爾
All right, let's get into it. Uh, Rachel.

1180
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,710
蕾切爾
Hey, Rachel.

1181
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:52,290
蕾切爾  你在聽課嗎
Rachel, are you still with us?

1182
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,080
我在聽
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

1183
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,420
-抱歉  -好
- Sorry. - All right.

1184
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,360
第四題
Question number four,

1185
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,060
鉀的符號是什麼
what is the symbol for potassium?

1186
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,470
有人知道嗎
Anybody?

1187
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,510
請進
Yeah.

1188
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,590
弗蘭克
Hey, Frank.

1189
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:19,820
上周我做了更深入的調查
I've been doing some more digging over the past week.

1190
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,900
我有點擔心
I'm... concerned...

1191
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,520
我所發現的東西
with what I found.

1192
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,520
過來說
Okay, come in.

1193
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,900
我們現在沒有收據
Look, now we don't have receipts,

1194
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,470
但有一些供應商  他們
but some of these vendors, they're...

1195
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:41,970
帕姆的事不只是我們起初認為的
this Pam thing isn't a question of $250,000

1196
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,650
二十五美元的問題
like we'd initially thought.

1197
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,860
好吧
Well, okay, uh,

1198
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:49,060
你估計大概有多少
do you have any sense of what the number might be?

1199
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:52,140
五十萬
I mean, are we talking 500?

1200
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,190
一百萬
Are we talking a million?

1201
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:55,870
菲爾  說說吧  我很難
I mean, Phil, work with me. I can't do anything but just...

1202
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:57,810
我不知道  我不知道
I don't know, I don't know.

1203
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,560
你不知道  好吧
You don't... okay, fine. So...

1204
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:02,880
那就算清楚  好嗎
figure it out, all right?

1205
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,460
發揮你的數字專長
Work your numbers magic and then,

1206
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,190
就我們兩人把這事辦妥了  好嗎
let's the two of us deal with it from there, okay?

1207
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,620
謝謝  菲爾
Thanks, Phil.

1208
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,980
還有其他事
Well, there's something else.

1209
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,650
寒假期間飛往倫敦希思羅機場的機票
A flight to London, Heathrow, over winter break...

1210
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,720
-發票開給  -那是我的
- ...billed to... - Yeah, that's me.

1211
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,500
機票是買給我的  去參加佩爾會議
That flight was for me, for the Pell Conference.

1212
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,800
你知道的
You knew about the Pell.

噴氣式飛機的頭等艙
First class, Concorde jet.

1214
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:28,930
不是我訂的機票  那都是傑妮的工作
I don't book the flights. That's always been Jenny's job.

1215
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:31,760
-即使是我訂的  -費用是兩個座位的
- But look, even if I had... - The charge is for two seats.

1216
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,120
頭等艙兩個並排的座位
Two seats side by side in first.

1217
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:39,980
一張單程票五千美元
It's $5,000 each way per ticket.

1218
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,830
總共兩萬美元
It's $20,000.

1219
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,160
這應該是弄錯了
Yeah, well, that sounds like a mistake.

1220
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,370
我打給了航空公司
You know, I called the airline.

1221
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:54,220
凱爾·孔特雷拉是誰
Who's Kyle Contreras?

1222
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,340
好吧
Okay, okay.

1223
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:13,550
你要這麼耍我嗎
So that's how you wanna play it.

1224
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:15,270
什麼  不  我不是耍你
What, no. I'm not playing...

1225
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:16,900
真是厚顏無恥
I mean, the audacity.

1226
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,420
花了六個月
Coming from the man who spent six months

1227
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:22,750
偽造我們的記錄來掩蓋

1228
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,420
在對學校的受信責任上的失職
of fiduciary duty to the school.

1229
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:26,910
等等  不是  不是這樣的
Wait a second, that's not what, that's not what's going on.

1230
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,850
不是嗎
No, no?

1231
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,840
帕姆的事本不該發生  對吧
Pam didn't have to happen, right?

1232
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,080
你本可以阻止的  你是審計
You could have prevented that. You're the auditor.

1233
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,690
人家花錢雇你幹什麼
The people here pay you for what?

1234
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:37,270
你想走就走  想玩戲劇就玩戲劇
So you can go off and do your community theater

1235
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,680
我們學校的賬本都不用管的嗎
instead of taking care of our school's books?

1236
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,730
對  對
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1237
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,370
指手畫腳我也會  菲爾
Oh, I can point fingers too, Phil.

1238
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:46,360
但是我想我們看法是一致的
Right, but I think we both agree that

1239
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,670
這不過是浪費我們的時間而已
that wouldn't be a very productive use of our time.

1240
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,150
-可是  -菲爾
- But... - Phil.

1241
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:52,750
你要不要去做你的事
Are you gonna do your job,

1242
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:55,360
還是要我把海韋希本人叫過來
or do I have to call Hevesi in here himself

1243
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,750
讓他替你把工作做了
to come and do it for you?

1244
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:58,180
因為我現在就能給他打電話
Because I will call him right now.

1245
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,740
我會處理的
I will deal with it.

1246
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,860
很抱歉我提起這件事  我不該提的
I'm sorry that I brought it up. I shouldn't have.

1247
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:04,270
是  太對了  你不該提的
Yeah, damn right you shouldn't have.

1248
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,810
你不會再聽到這事了
You won't hear about it again.

1249
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:08,630
很好
Good.

1250
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:12,080
出去
Get out of here.

1251
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:41,160
爸  我能問你件事嗎
Hey, Dad, can I ask you something?

1252
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:45,110
你不想回答也可以
And you don't have to answer if you don't want to.

1253
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,010
可以啊  你隨便問
Yeah, you can ask me anything.

1254
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,890
我知道當時你說過
I mean, I know what you had said at, at the time,

1255
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:55,450
那時候
when, um,

1256
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,820
發生的那些事
all that stuff was happening.

1257
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,460
內幕交易
The insider trading.

1258
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,530
你真的不知情嗎
Did you really not know?

1259
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,860
你是不是想問我有沒有參與其中
Are you asking me if I was a part of it?

1260
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:14,100
我沒有參與
No, I wasn't.

1261
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,550
任何時候都沒有參與  我向你保證
Not at any point in time, I promise you.

1262
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,420
但是
But, uh...

1263
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,010
你要理解
You gotta understand,

1264
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:26,890
我整個職業生涯都跟那些人打交道
those were guys that I had come up with my entire career.

1265
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:30,420
你和尼爾週末就跟他們的孩子玩
Guys whose kids you and Neil played with on the weekends.

1266
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,510
他們有家庭  他們都是好人
Guys with families. They were good people.

1267
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:36,550
長遠來看  一切都會過去的
And it was all gonna even out in the long run.

1268
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,210
誰會在乎呢
So who cares?

1269
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:43,360
我當時什麼都沒說
I didn't say anything.

1270
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,190
我本來可以說的
I could have.

1271
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,280
但是我沒說
But I didn't.

1272
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,650
這是我要背的包袱
And that's something I live with.

1273
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,310
早
Morning.

1274
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,830
早
Morning.

1275
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:28,540
記錄顯示  多年可疑經費支出始於高層

1276
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:50,540
鮑勃
Bob...

1277
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:54,110
你讓我成為這個地區的公眾人物
you had me serve as the public face of this district,

1278
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,260
代表繁榮的形象
an image that reflects prosperity.

1279
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:59,280
我知道出了這樣的事情很糟糕
Okay, I know it might look bad all laid out like that

1280
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,300
但是試試從我的角度看問題
but try and see this from my point of view.

1281
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,550
這就是我做的工作
This is me doing the job I was hired for.

1282
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:06,370
皺巴巴的西裝是一回事
A wrinkled suit. Yeah, okay, that's one thing.

1283
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:09,380
這完全是另一回事
This is something else entirely.

1284
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,040
不不不  我的僱傭合同有一項條款
No, no, no, my employment contract

1285
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,990
允許我在履行職責所需的

所有費用上

1287
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:17,520
-有充分的自由裁量權  -這點我知道
- to the discharge of my duties. - I know that.

1288
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,640
你的僱傭合同是我擬的
I wrote your employment contract.

1289
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:21,470
關鍵詞就是這個"自由裁量權"
The key word there was "discretion."

1290
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,750
-鮑勃  你沒聽我說  -我聽得很清楚
- Bob, you're not hearing me. - I'm hearing fine.

1291
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,860
你花了三萬塊乾洗衣服
You spent $30,000 on dry cleaning.

1292

好幾年累積的  是的
Over a number of years, yes, I did,

1293
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,330
我會全部還上的
and I will pay it all back.

1294
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,860
但我這麼做是為了學校
Right, but I did it for the good of the school.

1295
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:37,010
不  你就是為了自己好看
No, you just... you wanted to look pretty.

1296
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:41,880
拜託  弗蘭克
Come on, Frank.

1297
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,550
如今這已經是公開的秘密了
It's practically, it's an open secret

1298
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:46,580
你的行為舉止
nowadays with the way you're carrying on.

1299
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,270
華麗的西裝  古龍水
The flashy suits, the cologne.

1300
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:52,140
你做的整形
The shit that you're doing to your face.

1301
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,360
他們都笑話你
They laugh at you.

1302
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:58,230
你是我的人
You were my guy.

1303
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,540
我帶你入伙的  我還替你辯解
I brought you in. I defended you.

1304
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,750
現在我被你害慘了  我們都被你害慘了
Now, I'm compromised now. We all are.

1305
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,410
因為
Because of, of...

1306
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:11,990
你們這些人對我們做了什麼
What did you people do to us?

1307
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:22,390
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

1308
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:32,230
很多年前
So we were at dinner

1309
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:34,210
我們一起吃晚飯
however many years ago.

1310
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,210
不是什麼高檔餐廳  是...
Uh, it was nowhere fancy. It was...

1311
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,630
貝爾大街上的一家披薩店
a pizza place on Bell Boulevard.

1312
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,140
兩份希臘沙拉和一杯汽水
Two Greek salads and a fountain drink.

1313
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:45,380
我弄錯了  不小心刷錯了卡
And I fucked up, I used the wrong card by accident.

1314
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,020
二十美元
It's for $20.

1315
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:50,070
然後我說  週一我會把錢還上的
And I said, I'd even it all out on Monday.

1316
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,510
我會自掏腰包把錢還給學校
I'd reimburse the school out of pocket.

1317
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:53,380
不論怎樣我們都要還
Whatever we had to do, you know.

1318
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,560
週一到了  又過去了
Monday came and went.

1319
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:00,630
沒人說一句話  沒人在乎
Nobody said anything. Nobody, nobody cared.

1320
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:05,730
週二  刷了一個六十美分的硬麵包圈
On Tuesday, it was a 60 cent bagel.

1321
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,170
鮑勃  如果...
Bob, if...

1322
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:09,230
如果我想要錢
if I wanted the money...

1323
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,120
我早就去華爾街了
I would have gone to Wall Street.

1324
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,680
我會像你一樣
I'd be living in a big house

1325
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:16,000
住在郊區的大房子  但是...
in the country estates like you, but...

1326
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,130
我想要有所作為
I wanted to make a difference.

1327
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,870
對吧
Right?

1328
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,460
是的  我們都是  你看
I did, we did, look.

1329

我們現在排名第四
We're number four.

1330
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,220
我幫大家爭到了第四的位置
I got us all the way to number four.

1331
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,640
我拿著教師水平的工資做到了
Right, and I did it on a glorified teacher's salary

1332
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:34,100
而你和其他人卻從這個學區賺了幾百萬
while you and everyone else made millions off the district.

1333
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,910
我幫大家爭到了第四
I got us to number four,

1334
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,590
我會帶領大家爭到第一的
and I will get us to number one.

1335
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:39,820
董事會召開了緊急會議
The board, we convened an emergency session.

1336
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,710
我們要就十一月處理帕姆的情況
We're gonna make a public statement

1337
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,320
向鎮上發表公開聲明
to the town about the way we handled Pam in November.

1338
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,970
什麼  拜託  不行
What? Come on, no.

1339
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,320
-是的  必須這樣  -不行  不行
- No, yes, that's how it has to be. - No, no.

1340
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:50,800
現在不行  不要
Not now, no.

1341
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,970
要等到預算投票通過才行
Not until the budget vote goes through.

1342
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:55,300
就差幾天了  鮑勃  這個...
It's a few days away. Bob, it's...

1343
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:57,370

Bob.

1344
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,120
我還有辦法讓貝卡進哈佛
I can still get Becca into Harvard.

1345
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,230
希望你能找到內心的安寧  弗蘭克
I hope you find peace, Frank.

1346
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,590
-為什麼是孩子們  -請...
- Why are we hearing about this... - Please...

1347
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,970
而不是你親自告訴我們
from our children and not from you?

1348
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:00,460
-我們知道你們  -我們的錢到底在哪
- We know you're... - Where the hell's our money?

1349
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,200
我們知道你們很生氣  也知道你們很憤怒
We know you're upset. We know you're angry.

1350
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,180
但是我們不能...我們不能
But we cannot... we simply cannot afford

1351
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,860
通過控制學校的預算
to hold our school's budget hostage

1352
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:10,350
來妨礙你們孩子的教育
to place a filibuster on your children's education.

1353
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:14,280
這是高層勾結
This is collusion at the highest level.

1354
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,510
我們要求辭職
We demand resignations.

1355
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:19,120
這樣沒用
This is not productive.

1356
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:21,980
不不不  我理解你們的心情
No, no, no, no, I understand where this is coming from.

1357
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,130
但是我會一一回答你們的問題
But I will answer each of your questions.

1358
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:27,830
首先請允許我讀一下這份聲明
First, please just let me read this statement that I prepared.

1359
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,050
你們都該進監獄
You all should be in prison!

1360
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,340
夠了
Enough!

1361
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,870
瑪麗·安  到底發生什麼了
Mary Ann, what the hell's going on?

1362
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:51,410
瑪麗·安
Mary Ann?

1363
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:53,380
海韋希今早打電話來了
Hevesi called this morning.

1364
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,910
弗蘭克  你說過他永遠不會打電話來的
Frank, you said he would never call.

1365
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,600
弗蘭克
Frank.

1366
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,300
你好  塔索內博士
Hi, Dr. Tassone.

1367
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:05,310
很高興能等到你
Oh, we're so glad we could catch you.

1368
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:08,010
施魏策爾夫人  卡蘿爾  現在真不是時候
Uh, Ms. Schweitzer, uh, Carol, now's really not the best time.

1369
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:10,630
拜託了  我們只佔用您一點時間
Please, please, we just need one minute of your attention.

1370
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:13,980
查德有件事非常想和您分享
Chad has something that he would really like to share with you.

1371
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,750
好吧  拜託  您能花一點時間
All right, please, why don't you just take a moment,

1372
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:16,820
聽他讀完嗎
all right, and hear him out.

1373
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,240
當然
Of course.

1374
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:20,980
當然可以
Of course I will.

1375
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,020
-好了嗎  -好吧
- Yeah? - Okay.

1376
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:28,990
下午好  塔索內博士  您週末過得怎麼樣
Good afternoon, Dr. Tassone. How was your weekend?

1377
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,160
希望您愉快  我今天想跟您談談
Good, I hope. I'd like to talk to you today

1378
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,740
您管理的實驗班
about the OMNI program that you are running.

1379
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,560
等等  我們去年秋天已經談過這件事了
Wait, I thought we already discussed the subject of OMNI last fall.

1380
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,980
是的  米利措克讓他補考了
Oh, yeah, no, Militzok gave him the make-up test

1381
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:39,520
但是她加大了難度來為難他
but she made it harder to spite him.

1382
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,160
沒有哪個三年級學生能通過那個考試
And no third grader could pass that test.

1383
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,070
好的  我想我得調查一下
All right, well, I guess I'll just have to look into it.

1384
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:45,740
查德  你給塔索內博士讀完吧
Chad, why don't you just finish reading for Dr. Tassone?

1385
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:47,420
-好的  -嗯
- Okay. - Uh-huh.

1386
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,640
我真心希望您能考慮讓我
I very much hope that you will still consider me

1387
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,960
進這個實驗班
for this amazing program.

1388
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,500
我相信我很聰明  因此可以
I believe I am very bright and could benefit

1389
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,360
從加...

-加...  -把那個念出來

1391
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,900

1392
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:03,990
-加速  -嗯  是的
- Accelerated? - Mm-hmm, that's right.

1393
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,010
塔索內博士  你聽到塔索內博士說的了
Dr. Tassone. You hear what Dr. Tassone said?

1394
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,970
好的  從這段開頭再來一遍
Okay, all right, start again from the beginning of the paragraph.

1395
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,550
下午好  塔索內博士  您週末過得怎麼樣
Good afternoon, Dr. Tassone. How was your weekend?

1396
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,020
-我希望您愉快  -不不不  就跳到
- Good, I hope. - Oh, no, no, let's, let's skip

1397
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,740
有問題的那個句子  查德
to that trouble sentence there, Chad.

1398
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:17,880
也行  好吧  慢慢來
That's okay. All right, yeah, take your time.

1399
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:19,190
從...
From...

1400
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,460
我相信我很聰明  因此可以
I believe I am very bright and could benefit

1401
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:25,440
從加...
from learning thusly at an ack...

1402
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:28,320
-加速  -"加組"
- Accelerated. - "Ackselated"?

1403
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:30,030
加速
Accelerated.

1404
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:33,180
-"加足"  -加  速
- "Arrelicated"? - Ac-celerated.

1405
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,220
好吧
Okay.

1406
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,440
你喜歡賽車嗎  查德
Do you like race cars, Chad?

1407
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:44,090
喜歡嗎  好的
Yeah? Okay.

1408
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:50,020
假設你坐在賽車
Let's say you're in a racecar.

1409
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:51,920
好了  這樣  不用那個了
All right, here, you don't need that.

1410
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,880
你坐在賽車
You're in a racecar.

1411
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:59,160
處於印第安納波利斯五百英里大獎賽的領先位置
First place at the Indy 500

1412
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,130
世界上所有的贊助商都來了
with, with all the sponsorships in the world.

1413
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:05,470
風吹過你的頭髮  你感覺很棒
The wind is in your hair and you're feeling just great,

1414
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:08,140
突然間  你感到後面有東西追上來
and all of a sudden, you feel this thing behind you

1415
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:09,220
快碰上你的擋泥板
digging into your fender,

1416
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:10,720
然後你朝後視鏡一看
and you look into the mirror, right.

1417
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,760
有一個掛鉤
And there's this hook.

1418
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,180
你的擋泥板上有個掛鉤
There's a hook in your fender dug in real good,

1419
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,810
掛鉤上綁著一條長長的金屬繩
and it's connected to a... a long metal rope

1420
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:17,980
繩子的末端
and at the end of that rope

1421
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,560
綁著巨大的五噸重的煤渣塊
is, well, it's a massive five-ton cinder block.

1422
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,020
知道吧  查德  對吧
Okay, Chad? All right?

1423
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,190
你的任務是開車
So your job is driving.

1424
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,490
你是達勒·恩哈德  後面是煤渣塊
You're Dale Earnhardt and here's this cinder block,

1425
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:28,780
旁邊所有的車飛奔而過
and all the other cars are soaring past you and

1426
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:30,410
你從第一位掉到了最後一位
you've gone from first to last place

1427
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:31,410
你就不停地想
and you keep thinking to yourself,

1428
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:33,410
我到底要怎麼做才能甩掉後面這玩意
"What the hell do I have to do to get this thing off my back?"

1429
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:34,950
好的  我告訴你  查德  很簡單
Well, I'll tell you, Chad. It's real simple.

1430
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,870
你的腳就使勁踩油門
You just put your foot on the gas real hard

1431
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,000
你加快速度
and you accelerate,

1432
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,960
你加快速度  繩子就會斷成兩截
you accelerate so fast that rope snaps in two,

1433
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,210
煤渣就爆了
the cinder block explodes,

1434
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:44,630
跟我一起說  查德
and just say it with me, Chad.

1435
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:47,220
加速  加速  加速
Accelerate. Accelerate. Accelerate.

1436
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,930
-加速  -對了
- Accelerate? - Yes.

1437
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,520
-好了  -很好
- Okay. - Yes!

1438
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,350
你腦子有問題吧
What, what is your problem, huh?

1439
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,100
我有問題
My problem?

1440
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,730
你就是我的問題
My problem is you.

1441
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,530
卡蘿爾  是你這種
Carol, it's, it's, it's the people who

1442
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,530
像溜賽馬一樣拿孩子攀比的人
who trot their poor children out like racehorses at Belmont.

1443
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:09,820
-你說什麼  -是你這種
- Excuse me? - Who derive some perverse joy

1444
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:12,450
通過支使我們獲取變態滿足感的人
out of treating us like low-level service reps.

1445
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:15,450
-夠了  -你還記得坐在你身邊
- Okay... - I mean, do you remember the teachers who sat with you,

1446
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:16,790
握著你的手
who held you by the hand,

1447
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:18,790
-教你加法的老師嗎  -別說了
- who taught you to add. - No.

1448
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:20,710
還有減法  帶你讀《了不起的蓋茨比》
And subtract, or showed you Gatsby,

1449
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:23,170
塞林格的書  甚至是《殺死一隻知更鳥》
Salinger for the first time. "Mockingbird," even.

1450
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,840
你忘了他們的名字嗎
Do, do their names escape you?

1451
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,040
-他們長什麼樣  -夠了
- Are their faces a blur? - Okay.

1452
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:27,300
不  你給我聽好
No, you listen to me!

1453
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,130
你不想把我們當人對待
You don't wanna see us as people

1454
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:33,930
因為那對你來說不夠便利
because that is not convenient for you.

1455
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:37,100
你用完了就把我們拋到腦後
You just leave us behind at will.

1456
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,730
再也想不起來
Never think about us again.

1457
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:42,020
懂嗎  你可能會忘  但我們不會
All right, you might forget, but we don't.

1458
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:45,190
我們永遠不會忘
We never forget, ever.

1459
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,240
他怎麼了
What's wrong with him?

1460
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,450
我也不知道
You know what, I don't know.

1461
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,740
我覺得沒怎麼
I don't think anything's wrong.

1462
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:55,870
我們去吃點東西  然後就回家  好嗎
We're gonna get some food and we're gonna go home, okay?

1463
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:56,870
好
All right.

1464
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,960
你應該感到羞恥
You should be ashamed of yourself.

在佛州和漢普敦的兩處海濱別墅

1470
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,260
我的律師到了嗎
Is my lawyer here yet?

1471
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,010
你要把牢底坐穿了  帕姆
You're going away for a long time, Pam.

1472
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:54,670
而且不只是你
And not just you.

1473
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,220
我們有足夠的證據起訴你全家
We've got enough here to indict the whole family.

1474
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,300
別把他們扯進來
Don't you talk about them.

1475
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,390
尤其是可憐的吉姆
And poor Jim especially.

1476
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:01,560
剛剛振作起來
Just gettin' back on his feet and all.

1477
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:04,270
你知道這年頭有前科的人
You have any idea what the job market looks like

1478
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:05,860
找工作有多難嗎
these days for ex-cons?

1479
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:11,490
這樣吧
You know...

1480
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,450
也許你還來得及救他們
it may not be too late for you to save them.

1481
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:17,080
救你兒子
Save your son.

1482
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,500
你來做什麼
What are you doing here?

1483
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:31,340
我想見你了
I wanted to see you.

1484
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:36,430
你不用上班嗎
You don't have work?

1485
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:38,470
我辭職了
I quit.

1486
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,100
-什麼時候  -就今天
- When? - Today.

1487
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:44,810
我就...
I just...

1488
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:48,060
直接上了飛機  現在我來了
just got on a plane and now I'm here.

1489
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,650
我再也不走了
And I... I'm not leaving again.

1490
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,050
來跳舞
Dance.

1491
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,390
-來跟我跳舞  弗蘭克  -不  不要
- Dance with me, Frank. - No, no.

1492
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:03,810
跳一會  來吧
A little move, come on.

1493
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:05,930
來嘛
Come on.

1494
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:07,720
請
Please.

1495
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,440
這就對了
There we go.

1496
01:29:10,650 --> 01:29:13,110
酒放下  酒放下
Drink down, drink down.

1497
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:19,530
好了
Okay.

1498
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:20,910
什麼
What?

1499
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,210
-動起來  動起來  -不要
- Shake it up, shake it. - No.

1500
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,600
來嘛
Come on!

1501
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,530
特殊事務部

1502
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,460
沒必要當著他們的面
They don't need to watch.

1503
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,080
拿索郡警察

1504
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:42,800
櫃子最上面的抽屜埵酗T萬美元
There's $30,000 in the top drawer of the dresser.

1505
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:45,550
什麼
What?

1506
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:48,220
如果你省著花  能撐一年
Okay, if you're careful, you can make it last a year.

1507
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,470
你說什麼呢
What are you talking about?

1508
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:53,260
你的天賦獨一無二
What you've got in you is so special

1509
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:57,350
你永遠不能讓任何人奪走它
that you can't ever, ever let anyone take it away from you

1510
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,730
或者利用它
or exploit it.

1511
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,940
什麼...
What the hell...

1512
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,230
你真的  真的...
You really, you really...

1513
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:04,230
-搞什麼  -跟我在一起對你沒好處
- ...is happening right now? - You don't want me here.

1514
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,660
你因紐約州的逮捕令被捕了
You're under arrest for a warrant out of the state of New York.

1515
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,660
請下車
Please step out of the car.

1516
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,910
弗蘭克  到底怎麼回事
Frank, what the hell is happening right now?

1517
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:11,580
先生  把雙手放在儀表盤上
Sir, I need your hands on the dash.

1518
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,740
弗蘭克  到底怎麼回事
Frank, what the hell is happening right now?

1519
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,790
你不瞭解我
You don't know me.

1520
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,500
-弗蘭克  -我不是好人
- Frank! - Okay, I'm no good.

1521
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:17,790
這麼久以來
All this time

1522
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:19,420
我一直在騙你  騙所有人
I've been lying to you and everyone else.

1523
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:20,080
-我是個騙子  -快點
- I'm a liar. - Now!

1524
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,840
快把手放在儀表盤上
Put your hands on the dash now.

1525
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,960
快點  弗蘭克  照他們說的做
Do what... Frank, do what they say, now.

1526
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,260
-下車  -對不起
- Get out of the car. - I'm sorry.

1527
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,430
-不  不  -下車
- No, no, no. - Out of the car.

1528
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,470
弗蘭克
Frank!

1529
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:32,390
-不  先生  別過來  -弗蘭克
- No, sir, stand back, sir, stop. - Frank!

1530
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:34,470
他什麼都沒做  別碰他
He's not doing anything. Leave him alone.

1531
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:36,060
弗蘭克  弗蘭克
Frank, Frank!

1532
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,980
靠
Shit.

1533
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:40,440
弗蘭克  弗蘭克  弗蘭克
Frank, Frank, Frank!

1534
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:46,280
我們印了
We printed,

1535
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,070
學區的宣傳冊
pamphlets for the school district.

1536
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:52,490
手冊之類的
Handbooks and such.

1537
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:53,660
"我們"
We?

1538
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,540
只有我
Me.

1539
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,670
言辭力量只有我一個員工
WordPower was just me.

1540
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:02,000
沒有合夥人
No partners.

1541
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:04,210
我這麼問是因為
I only ask because

1542
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:06,800
你公司一半的收入
it looks like half your corporation's earnings

1543
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,800
似乎都轉至弗朗西斯·A·塔索內名下了
were transferred over to one Francis A. Tassone.

1544
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:16,430
你不能逼我
You can't make me.

1545
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,980
你不能
No, you, you can't...

1546
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:23,230
逼我指證我的配偶
make me testify against my spouse.

1547
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:27,190
配偶
Spouse?

1548
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:31,610
我們是同居伴侶
We're domestic partners.

1549
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,080
我們已經在一起三十三年了
We've been together 33 years.

1550
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:40,960
我們有權得到聯邦保護
We're entitled to federal protections.

1551
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,540
你們正式結婚了嗎
Are you legally wed?

1552
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:47,800
我想起來了
You know something?

1553
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:50,220
我們問詢過的人都說塔索內
Everybody we spoke to said Tassone

1554
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:52,430
提起過他有個配偶  老婆
did talk about a spouse, a wife.

1555
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:54,220
但她已經去世很久了
But that she'd been dead for some time.

1556
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:55,600
三十多年了
Thirty-odd years or something.

1557
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,930
你記得吧  他桌上那張新娘照片
You remember that, the bridal photo he had on his desk.

1558
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,390
我們查出她的名字了嗎
We ever get a name on her?

1559
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:01,560
別說了
Stop it.

1560
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:05,530
別說什麼
Stop what?

1561
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:09,320
你肯定也見過吧
I mean, you must have seen it, too.

1562
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,400
你肯定經常去他的辦公室
I'm sure you were over by his office all the time

1563
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:14,780
畢竟你每年承接學校八十萬美元的工作
what with that $800,000 job you were doing for the school.

1564
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:20,580
好吧
Okay.

1565
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,460
我們換個話題
Let's try another avenue.

1566
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,210
你是否知道
Were you aware...

1567
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,470
你的伴侶
that your partner...

1568
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:35,430
今年早些時候在內華達州買了一處房產
closed on a property in Nevada earlier this year

1569
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:36,970
和另一個男人一起
with another man?

1570
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:54,990
他是個舞者
He's a dancer.

1571
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,010
這媯o生了一件可怕的事
A terrible thing happened here.

1572
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:52,090
而且不僅是錢的問題
And it's not just the money.

1573
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:54,130
問題是對學校的信任
It's about trust in our schools.

1574
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:56,720
制度的廉正
The integrity of our institutions.

1575
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,760
我不知道怎麼才能從這件事中恢復過來
I don't know how we ever recover from this.

1576
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,220
家長和老師間的關係不復以往
It was never the same between the parents and teachers.

1577
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:03,020
事發後他們對我們的態度就變了
They treated us differently after that.

1578
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,890
好像我們知情
Like we knew.

1579
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,850
好像我們知情不報一樣
Like we had any idea at all.

1580
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,730
我們當然希望能早點發現問題
Of course we wish we would have found out about this earlier.

1581
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,230
但是一帆風順的時候
You know, when things are going well,

1582
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:12,900
誰想沒事找事呢
who wants to go huntin' for problems?

1583
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:22,120
他不辭辛勞
He went out of his way.

1584
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:24,410
如果你需要任何幫助
If we ever needed anything from him

1585
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:26,170
他總是笑臉相迎
he was there with a smile.

1586
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,130
所以大家都順心
So we were all happy.

1587
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:30,500
所以沒人質疑
So we didn't ask questions.

1588
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:34,920
於是這個騙子和他的男友
So you have this, this liar and his boyfriend

1589
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,050
在這個城市媔╳x若步
trotting around in the city in God knows what.

1590
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:40,340
他蒙蔽了我們的雙眼
He just pulled the wool over our eyes.

1591
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:42,720
我還能說什麼  真的很噁心
You know, what can I say? It's sick, it is.

1592
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:45,310
回想起過去那麼多年的
You think back over the smaller moments,

1593
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:48,310
一些細節  他給人...
over the years where he just seemed...

1594
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:51,270
我說不好  他給人感覺很真誠
I don't know, he just seemed so real.

1595
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,400
很真誠
So real.

1596
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:56,700
謝謝
Thanks.

1597
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:03,980
主編

1598
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:10,000
沒事  我知道  我懂
No, I know. I know you do.

1599
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,050
即將畢業的高三學生
The outgoing seniors.

1600
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:42,050
考進常春藤院校的人數打破了記錄
They're going to the Ivy League in unprecedented numbers.

1601
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,930
這是史上第一次
It was the first year on record

1602
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:50,470
考進每所院校的人數
that we had admission offers from each school

1603
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:51,810
都增多了
going up!

1604
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,110
到底是什麼原因
And what changed?

1605
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,690
是什麼讓我們這所小小的公立學校
What makes our little public school

1606
01:38:57,690 --> 01:39:00,400
在長島的眾多學校中鶴立雞群
so different from all the others like ours on Long Island?

1607
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:03,450
更不要提全國範圍了
Let alone in the country at large.

1608
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:05,950
說到底
At the end of the day,

1609
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:09,620
我認為關鍵是廉正
I think it boils down to integrity.

1610
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,370
我們的教員
Integrity in our faculty,

1611
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:14,790
我們的課程
in our classrooms and curriculum,

1612
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:20,340
以及我們親力親為  思維開闊的教學理念的廉正
and our approach to a broad-minded, hands-on education.

1613
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:24,930
誠然  這些口號都被喊爛了
That's all the stuff that gets thrown around all the time, sure.

1614
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:27,600
但在我的職業生涯中
But never in my career

1615
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,390
我從未見過對這些素質的這種熱情
have I seen such passion for all these factors.

1616
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:36,440
然後再加上著眼大局的意識
And then, paired with the willingness to think big.

1617
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,820
你們知道自己為何而來
You know why you're here.

1618
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:42,900
你們知道這對我們鎮的意義
You know what this means for our town.

1619
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:47,240
但我要向你們介紹一位英雄
But I'm gonna tell you about one man who's a hero

1620
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:50,410
沒有他這一切都不可能實現
without whom none of this would be possible.

1621
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,580
拿第一不可一蹴而就
You don't get to number one overnight.

1622
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,670
要花費多年的心血
It takes years of hard work.

1623
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:56,460
而這是一個
And this is really a man

1624
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,880
真正懂得合作的男人
who knows what it means to work together.

1625
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:04,680
弗蘭克·塔索內上任之前
Before Frank Tassone...

1626
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,350
沒有社區服務
There was no community service.

1627
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:12,140
沒有公眾宣傳
There was no public outreach.

1628
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,390
沒有天橋
There was no SkyWalk.

1629
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,810
這個男人為學校奉獻了太多
This is a man who has given the school so much.

1630
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:18,350
幹得漂亮
Magnificent.

1631
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,190
祝賀你
Congratulations.

1632
01:40:21,190 --> 01:40:22,490
女士們  先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

1633
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:25,070
請和我一起歡迎他上台
please join me in welcoming the man

1634
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:27,740
他重整了我們的孩子們的學校
who whipped our kids' schools into shape

1635
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,240
讓我們登上了第一
and got us all the way to number one!

1636
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:44,880
你成功了  弗蘭克
You did it, Frank.

1637
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:11,910
第一  第一  第一
Number one, number one, number one!

1638
01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:57,640
弗蘭克·塔索內被判從羅斯林學區盜竊220萬美元
並被判處四至十二年有期徒刑

1639
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:58,150
帕梅拉·格盧金承認挪用公款430萬美元
並作證指控塔索內  她被判處三至九年有期徒刑

1640
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:58,420
羅斯林學區總共被盜1100萬美元
使本案成為美國歷史上最大的學校盜竊案

1641
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:13,350
《紐約時報》  《新聞日報》以及三州地區的
所有報紙都報道了這一醜聞

1642
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,760
但都是在羅斯林高中的校報
《山峰燈塔》捅破新聞之後

1643
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:27,210
由於紐約州養老金法案中的一處疏忽

1644
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:27,210
弗蘭克·塔索內仍然享有每年173495.04美元的退休金

1645
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:48,970
壞教育
