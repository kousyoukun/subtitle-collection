00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,850
下午好  欧森小姐
Good afternoon, Miss Ocean.

2
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,880
你好
Hi.

3
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,620
你应该知道  假释是特殊待遇
As you know, parole is a privilege.

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,350
假释的限制条件之一
And one of the restrictions on any parolee,

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,890
就是避免与
is to avoid the company

6
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,960
任何有犯罪记录的人共处
of any person who has a criminal record of any kind.

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,130
那基本排除了你的大多数家人
That would include most of your extended family.

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,030
我并不以此为豪
Yeah, that's obviously not something I'm proud of.

9
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,370
这对你来说是不可能完成的挑战吗
Would this pose an impossible challenge for you?

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,800
不  不
No. No.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,200
我不想要那种生活  我从来不想要那种生活
I don't want that life. I never wanted that life.

12
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,070
我哥哥
My brother, um...

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,370
愿他安息
May he rest in peace,

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,510
是个罪犯
was a criminal.

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,310
我爱他
I loved him,

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,610
但他是个诈骗犯
but he was a conman.

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,880
那是他骨子里的基因
It was in his blood.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,750
你骨子里没有吗  没有
And it's not in your blood?  No.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,280
没有  长官
No, sir.

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,560
我爱错了人
I fell for the wrong person.

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,960
那是个错误
It was a mistake.

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,760
但还是发生了
But it happened.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,830
如果我能出狱  我会...
And if I were to be released, I would, um...

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,500
抱歉
Sorry.

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,640
就算说出来也...
Wow, just saying that...

26
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,680
如果我能出狱
If I were to be released,

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,910
我只想过上简单的生活
I would just want the simple life.

28
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,250
我只想找个工作
I just wanna hold down a job,

29
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,780
结交点朋友
make some friends,

30
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,960
下班后去散散步  呼吸新鲜空气
go for a walk after work in the fresh air

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,890
养活自己
and pay my bills.

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,540
简单的生活
Simple life?

33
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,710
演得不错
Nice one.

34
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,480
你听说了吗  还有谁不知道
Heard about that?  Who didn't?

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,680
我花了五年排练呢
I had five years to rehearse it.

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,590
你的东西  谢谢
Here's your stuff.  Thank you.

37
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,030
表不错
Nice watch.

丹尼

39
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,160
是我哥哥的  传给你的吗
It's my brother's.  Left it to you?

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,790
是我偷的
I stole it.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,130
没关系  迪娜  他也是偷来的
It's fine, Dina. He stole it, too.

42
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,200
下周还是照常送一批货
So we're still gonna get a regular shipment next week.

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,100
你拿走你那份  再多拿几盒
You take your cut, plus a few extra cartons, okay?

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,800
我要你卖了  不是全抽了
I want you to trade 'em, not smoke 'em.

45
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,640
你打算去哪里
So where you going?

46
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,640
我有45块呢  迪娜
Well, I have 45 bucks, Dina.

好的  你有收据吗
Oh, of course. Do you have your receipt?

52
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,250
没有  但都没拆封过  没碰过
No, but they're unopened. They haven't been touched.

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,090
我真的需要你的收据

你带了当时使用的信用卡吗
Do you have the credit card that you used?

56
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,560
太荒谬了  我上周才买的
This is ridiculous! I bought these last week.

57
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,430
女士  你可以去六楼的客户服务中心
Ma'am, you can try client services on the sixth floor.

58

You know what? Never mind. I'll just keep 'em.

至少能给我一个袋子吧
Can I at least get a bag?

61
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,270
当然了
Sure.

我们刚退了2814号房
We just checked out of room 2814.

不  我知道  我知道
Oh, no!  I know, I know.

76
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,010
我们不想住在
And instead of staying

77
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,510
机场边的破旅店里
in some horrible airport hotel,

78
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,780
所以我们想能不能
we were hoping that maybe

79
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,380
要回我们原来的房间
we could get our original room back?

80
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,250
当然了  你们可以继续订那间房
Yeah, we can give you that same room back.

81
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,150
那真是太好了  太感谢你了
That would be amazing! Thank you so much!

82
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,660
我们准备先去吃点东西
Um, we're just gonna go grab a bite.

83
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,760
能找人先去打扫吗
Would it be possible to get the maid in there now?

84
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,090
当然了
Yes, absolutely.

85
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,030
太好了  真的很感谢

86
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,530

It's not a problem.

87
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,030
太感谢了  待会见

你好
Hi.

89
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,140
很抱歉  你能等会儿再来打扫吗
I'm so sorry. Can you finish up later?

90
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,550
我得好好休息一下
I just have to get off my feet.

祝您愉快  你也是
Have a great day.  You, too!

93
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,090
再见
Byebye.

94
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,090
结果他没搬进来
And he did not move in!

95
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,760
他想要回他的钱
And he wants his money back.

96
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,660
他还真的拿回了他的钱
And he gets his money back.

97
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,060
如果你说没拿  那就能说明你没有拿钱吗
If you said no, does that mean you didn't take the money?

98
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,730
你手上是几号箱
What crate are you on?

99
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,930
15
15.

100
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,130
听着
Listen.

101
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,640
你觉得我喜欢你吗  我相信你吗
You think I like you? You think I believe you?

102
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
你觉得我相信你说的话吗
You think I trust anything that you're saying?

103
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,710
答案是绝对不可能
The answer is absolutely not.

104
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,780
伙计们  9点30分了
Guys, it's 9:30.

105
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,650
太多了  太多了
It's too much. It's too much.

106
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,520
应该是离瓶盖三指
It's three fingers from the top.

107
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,850
不是一指  三指
Not one, it's three.

108
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,750
这是重播  爱普莉尔
It's a rerun, April.

109
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,920
她睡了自己的表哥  撞了车
She slept with her cousin, crashed the car.

110
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,620
宝宝不是他的
The baby's not his.

111
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,300
尝起来什么味
What's that taste like?

112
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,030
伏特加
Vodka.

113
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,570
伏特加  没错  但我不想要伏特加
Vodka. Exactly. But I don't want vodka.

114
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,870
我想要伏特加加水
I want vodka and water.

115
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,340
你知道为什么吗  你说
And do you wanna know why?  Uh, sure.

116
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,170
因为你喝醉了时  这尝起来就像伏特加
'Cause when you're drunk, it tastes like vodka.

117
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,080
对  对
Right.  Right.

118
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,710
我不在乎
I don't care!

119
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,640
那该死的公墓在哪里  晚上12点吗

120
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,390
我也想你
Oh, missed you, too.

121
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,780
丹尼·欧森

122
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,600
你最好在里面
You better be in there.

123
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,600
我知道你在  鲁本
I know you're there, Reuben.

124
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,810
你可以出来了
You can come on out.

125
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,010
我只是在哀悼
I was just paying my respects.

126
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,450
在角落里吗
From around the corner?

127
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,050
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

128
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,720
他们觉得找我来和你说最好
They thought I'd be the best one to talk to you.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
我要走了
Hmm. Gotta go.

130
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
他不想你这么做  黛布拉
He didn't want you to do this, Deborah.

131
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,360
做什么
Do what?

132
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,530
就是他不愿意告诉我们的你在做的事
Whatever it is he wouldn't tell us you're gonna do.

133
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,410
听着  黛布
Look, Deb.

134
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,760
有时候  你只要知道能够成功
Sometimes, just knowing the job will work

135
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,400
就已经够满足了
is satisfaction enough.

136
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,070
你不用非得动手
You don't actually gotta do it.

137
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,870
他还说了什么
What else did he say?

138
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,210
他说真是太天才了  好吧
He said it was brilliant.  Oh, okay.

139
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,180
还有你很可能会回监狱
And that you would probably end up back in prison.

140
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,520
我不会回监狱的
I'm not gonna end up back in prison.

141
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,690
好吗
Okay?

142
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,330
我要走了
I gotta go.

143
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,160
小心点
Be careful.

144
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,600
你看上去很帅
You're looking sharp.

145
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:26,910
冷静点
Take it easy.

146
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,210
刚蹲过监狱呢
Been in the slammer.

147
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,990
我还以为你换号码了
Oh, I just thought you changed your number.

148
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,950
搞到信贷额度了吗
Did you get the credit line?

149
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,890
还没有  为什么
Not yet.  Why not?

150
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,960
因为我不知道是用来干什么的
Because I don't know what it's for.

151
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
天啊
Oh, my God!

152
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,630
别这样
Don't do that.

153
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,700
哪样
Do what?

154
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,200
那就是我"我蹲了五年监狱
That would be my "I've just been in jail for five years,

155
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,430
结果我搭档让我失望了"的表情
"And my partner lets me down" Face.

156
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,910
我还不是你的搭档
Hey, I'm not your partner. Yet.

157
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,900
这儿真不错
This is nice.

158
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,610
钢丝围栏   带刺铁丝网
Chainlink, barb wire.

159
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,180
给你带了点东西
Brought you something.

160
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,480
我可以换点你偷来的东西吗
Can I exchange something you stole?

161
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,220
如果你对偷东西有意见
Well, if you're gonna have a problem with stealing,

162
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,050
你可能不会喜欢我们接下来要说的事
you're not gonna like the rest of this conversation.

163
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,990
怎么  我们得去商店偷东西吗  也许
What, we're gonna shoplift?  Maybe.

164
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,390
不  你总是这样
No. See, this is what you do.

165
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,390
你让我来猜  然后我就会感兴趣
You make me guess and then, I'm interested.

166
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,090
好吧  你认为因为
Okay.  And then you think because

167
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,490
我感兴趣  我就会想干
I'm interested, that I wanna do it.

168
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,260
你不想干你感兴趣的事吗
Don't you wanna do things you're interested in?

169
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,560
我对脑部手术有兴趣
I'm interested in brain surgery.

170
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,400
我们都知道那是不可能的
Well, we know that's not gonna happen.

171
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,300
随便了  你不想告诉我...
Whatever. You don't wanna tell me...

172
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,540
珠宝
It's jewels.

173
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,840
炫目  完美  又大又闪的

锁在一个在地下50英尺的保险箱中
that are locked in a vault 50 feet underground.

176
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,020
我们怎么把它们从保险箱中拿出来
How do we get them out of the vault?

177
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,060
他们会乖乖送上门
They're gonna bring 'em to us.

178
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,260
该死
Oh, bugger!

179
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,060
这地方不错
Nice place.

180
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,570
开暖气试试
Try heating it.

181
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,000
你的房间在楼上
There's a room for you upstairs.

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,900
你的东西也在楼上
Your stuff's upstairs, too.

183
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,400
我借了点东西
You know, I borrowed some shit.

184
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,510
我还以为你永远都用不上了呢
Figured you weren't using it.

185
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,680
克劳德·贝克画廊

186
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,790
克劳德·贝克画廊

187
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,180
这是你的画廊吗
So, is this your gallery?

188
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,240
对  其中之一
Yeah, one of them.

189
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,010
其他的在哪里
Where are the others?

190
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,380
伦敦的那家正准备开业
Well, I'm opening one in London.

191
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,010
准备在东京再开一家
Got plans for another one in Tokyo.

192
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,120
我们也在考虑洛杉矶
We're talking about LA,

193
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
但我不确定能不能成
but I'm not sure that makes sense.

194
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,880
那里有点缺乏创意
It's all a bit derivative out there, you know?

195
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,020
所以其实现在只有这一家
So this is the only one that exists?

196
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,530
实体上是这样
Well... Physically.

197
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,460
抱歉失陪一下
Excuse me one second.

198
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,600
抱歉  抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.

199
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,740
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

200
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,400
我本来想给你打电话的
I was meaning to call you.

201
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,410
天啊  看到你真好  你看上去...
Jesus, it's great to see you. You look...

202
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,940
进过监狱吗
Recently incarcerated?

203
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,510
很美  你看上去很美
Wonderful. You look wonderful.

204
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,250
你知道什么是刺刀吗
Do you know what a shiv is?

205
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,680
行了  住手  住手
Okay, stop. Just stop.

206
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,020
多么帅气的脸
Oh, such a nice face.

207
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,150
内心深处
You know, inside,

208
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,220
你就是一个小姑娘
you're what we call a pretty girl.

209
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,390
我要报警了  好的
I'll call the police.  Okay.

210
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,060
你知道我们怎么对待告密者吗
Do you know what we do with snitches?

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,170
他看到你了  对
He saw you?  Oh, yeah.

212
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,100
你为什么要做这种事
Why would you do something like that?

213
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,810
做个了结
Closure?

214
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,040
胡扯
Bullshit!

215
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,010
上帝啊
Jesus!

216
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,320
那你...
So did you...

217
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,450
没有
No.

218
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,880
只要了一个小纽扣
Just a little button.

219
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,570
一开始我考虑的是银行  因为...
So at first, I thought banks. 'Cause you know...

220
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,940
钱都存在那里嘛
That's where they have money?

221
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,970
没错  但是那有点无聊
Exactly. But that's kind of boring.

222
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,280
于是我想抢十家银行
So then I thought ten banks.

223
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,680
然后我意识到那可能
Then I realized that would be maybe

224
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,210
只有不理智的人才会...
coming from an angry place so...

225
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,680
还好你意识到了
Good you realized that.

226
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,580
是的  然后我就没法安静思考了
Yes. Then I couldn't even hear myself think.

227
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,750
一个号子里住五个女人呢
You know, five women in one cell.

228
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,490
于是我就想办法进了禁闭室
So I got myself thrown in solitary

229
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,620
在那个安静的环境下
for a little peace and quiet,

230
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,130
终于想出了一个主意
and that's where I finally came up with it.

231
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,350
权杖与宝珠
欧洲皇权的历史进程

232
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,920
这毕竟还是个博物馆  所以呢
It's still a museum.  So?

233
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,230
所以这不像去抢个酒水商店
So, it's not like robbing a liquor store.

234
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,160
抱歉  我不会说乌克兰语
I'm sorry, I don't speak Ukrainian.

235
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,860
我说  "我们不抢博物馆"
I said, "We're not robbing a museum."

236
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,870
我们要抢
We're robbing someone...

237
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,230
博物馆里的人
In a museum.

238
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,800
嗯  你提过了
Yeah, you mentioned.

239
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,270
听着
Look.

240
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,970
就算有成功的可能...  就是有可能
Even if this was possible...  It is possible.

241
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,880
就算有可能  我们还需要
Even if it was, we'd need, like,

242
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,140
20多个人和五十万资金
20 people and half a million dollars.

243
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,280
七
Seven.

244
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,410
七百万吗
Seven million?

245
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,220
七个人和两万
Seven people and 20 grand.

246
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,620
你为什么非要这么做
Why do you need to do this?

247
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,760
因为这是我擅长的
Because it's what I'm good at.

248
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
好吧
Uh, yeah.

249
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,730
你知道吗
You know what?

250
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,200
我预想了一千多次
I have run this thing a thousand times.

251
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,930
每次发展到被抓  我就会做改进
Every time I got caught, I fixed it.

252
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,730
三年了  我再也没被抓过
And in three years, I wasn't getting caught anymore.

253
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,630
在我得到假释时  一切在我脑中已经宛如时钟般精确
By the time I was paroled, it was running like clockwork.

254
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,400
完美
Perfectly.

255
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,370
每一步  你都跟我在一起
And you were there with me, every step of the way.

256
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,270
亲爱的  你是在向我求婚吗
Oh, honey, is this a proposal?

257
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,910
宝贝  我还没拿到钻石呢
Baby, I don't have a diamond yet.

258
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,550
拜托  你真的想下半辈子
Come on. Do you really wanna spend the rest

259
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,180
都靠给伏特加掺水度日吗
of your life watering down well vodka?

260
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,490
那可真是暴殄天物
Because it's really kind of a waste.

261
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,220
来一口
Come on. Take a bite.

262
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,290
就一口
Just take a bite.

263
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,690
你真的很烦人  张嘴
You're really irritating.  Open.

264
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
味道不错
That's good.

265
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
很不错
Very good.

266
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,040
大都会艺术博物馆年度展记者招待会

267
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,640
每年他们都会举办
So each year they host

268
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,770
全世界最大的派对
the biggest party in the world.

269
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,310
他们经常会请一名巨星来主持
And they always get a huge celebrity to host.

270
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,770
今年是达芙妮·克卢格
This year, it's Daphne Kluger.

271
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,640
没错  但她不是我们的目标
Yeah. But she's not our mark.

272
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,850
那谁是目标
So who's the mark?

273
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,380
好了  谁想第一个提问
All right, who wants to go first?

274
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,220
请提问
Yes.

275
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,650
你知道你穿谁的设计吗
Do you know who you're wearing?

276
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,390
拉珀拉  黑色的[内衣]
La Perla. It's black.

277
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,690
不  我是指谁给你造型
No, I mean who's dressing you?

278
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,490
我现在真的还不知道
I don't really know yet.

279
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,230
设计师
The designer.

280
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,200
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

281
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,700
一旦我知道了
But as soon as I do,

282
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,900
我就第一个告诉你
you'll be the very first person that I tell.

283
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,840
下一个问题
Uh, next question?

284
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,110
好了  我们需要一个设计师
All right, we need a designer.

285
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,370
没错
Exactly!

286
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,670
我们有很多目标
Now a lot of these we could target.

287
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,910
但是安娜不会同意的
But Anna won't approve them,

288
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,440
而一切都得安娜同意才行
and Anna has to approve everything.

289
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,780
我知道
I know.

290
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,450
有不少牌子没那么硬的选择
There's a few lessestablished choices,

291
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,950
但是他们可不会给我们带来什么优势
but they're not gonna give us the juice we need.

292
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,950
那么
So...

293
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,480
罗斯·威尔  我为什么知道这个名字
Rose Weil. Why do I know that name?

294
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,420
她很有名  在九十年代
Well, she was big, in the '90s.

295
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,760
天啊  那种爱德华式衣领和袖边
Oh, God, all the Edwardian collars and the ruffles.

296
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,930
很滑稽  但是安娜还是喜欢她
Travesty. But Anna still likes her.

297
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,490
她们每年都在肯特一起过复活节
They do Easter together every year in Kent.

298
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,700
英国人吗  爱尔兰人
Brits?  Irish.

299
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,500
而且她还欠了五百万的税
And she owes the IRS $5 million.

300
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,700
很糟糕
It's bad.

301
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,800
她的财产都被扣押了
There's a lien on her assets,

302
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,970
纽约

303
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,170
他们扣押了她的护照
they've impounded her passport.

304
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,710
银行没收了她的房子
The bank seized her townhouse.

305
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,210
她听起来很棒
She sounds amazing.

306
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,310
没错
Yeah.

307
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,580
我觉得我们很走运
I think we got lucky.

308
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,780
她赌上了一切
She gambled everything on this.

309
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,220
这可是一条看不到前景的路
This is a flight to nowhere without any peanuts.

310
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,690
自己筹钱  在奥马哈银行借贷
Selffinanced. Credit from an Omaha bank.

311
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,060
那边的那些人
Those guys over there?

312
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,330
是为数不多愿意借钱给她的人
The only ones who'll still loan her money.

313
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,930
他们看上去有点担心
They look a little worried.

314
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,870
谁能怪他们呢  这简直是一团糟
Yeah, who can blame them? This is a train wreck.

315
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,920
恭喜你
Congratulations.

316
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,290
你们是谁
Who are you?

317
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,430
你的粉丝
Big fans.

318
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,160
狂热粉丝
Very big.

319
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,300
刚刚...  真是
That was...  Just...

320
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,360
太美了
Gorgeous.

321
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,800
不  不是的
No, it wasn't.

322
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,470
那是一场灾难
It was a disaster.

323
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,370
我觉得你对你自己太苛刻了
I think you're being kind of hard on yourself.

324
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,610
很苛刻
Very.

325
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,380
你们看过这个了吗
Did you read this?

326
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,240
是一个博主写的
It's by a blogger.

327
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,450
"罗斯·威尔
"Rose Weil.

328
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,250
她的新时装系列就像逛了一圈
"Her new collection is like taking a tour

329
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,750
你奶奶的衣橱
of your grandmother's closet.

330
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,520
又过时  又陈旧
"Just as dated, and just as musty.

331
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,430
爱斯基摩人会把老年人都赶到浮冰上
"The Eskimo shove their elders out on an ice floe.

332
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,530
没别的意思"
"Just saying."

333
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,300
太残忍了
That's very cruel.

334
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,260
但这并不说明就是那样的
But it doesn't make it true.

335
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,670
我怎么会变成这样
How did I get here?

336
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,940
你两年花光了一千八百万
You spent $18 million in two years

337
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,910
还在塞纳河上买了两条船屋
and had two houseboats on the Seine.

338
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,710
我老了
I'm old.

339
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,610
你不老
Hey, you're not old.

340
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,680
我老了  我要进监狱了
I'm old, and I'm going to prison.

341
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,280
我会变得很穷很穷
Then I'm going to be really, really poor.

342
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,420
不一定
Not necessarily.

343
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,220
如果我们能让这一切都消失
What if we could make all this go away?

344
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,730
还能拿回你的护照呢
Even get your passport back.

345
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,560
怎么做
How?

346
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,900
为达芙妮·克卢格设计大都会晚宴的扮相
Dress Daphne Kluger for the Met Ball.

347
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,870
你疯了吗
Are you mad?

348
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,670
不  等等
No, hang on a minute.

349
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,910
你们是记者吗
Are you journalists?

350
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,780
当然不是  上帝啊  不是
Absolutely not.  God, no.

351
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,820
她看上去有点紧绷  有可能
Hmm. She seems sort of tense.  Can be.

352
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,150
好身材  好胸  特征明显

355
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,590
也许我们能给她...也许...
Maybe we could give her... Maybe...

356
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,160
也许我们能给她这个
Maybe we could give her this.

357
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,570
天啊  不行  不够时尚  我们能用更好的
God, no. Not chic. We can do better than that.

358
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,200
它的名字叫杜桑
It's called the Toussaint.

359
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,570
以贞·杜桑命名

362
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,110
好吧
Right.

363
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,180
她死后  他们将它卖回给卡蒂亚
After she died, they sold it back to Cartier,

364
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,850
后来就一直藏在他们的保险库中
and they've kept it in their vault ever since.

365
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,650
他们从来没拿出来过
They've never let it out.

366
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,050
那我们要怎么拿出来
So then, how are we gonna get it out?

367
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,460
他们也许会为她拿出来
Well, they might let it out for her.

368
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,960
今年晚宴的主题

371

所以如果你坚持要

372
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,010
达芙妮·克卢格戴杜桑

373
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,520
肯定很值钱

374
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,820

都是俄罗斯人  他们是黑客

没有  俄罗斯人没有几个不是黑客的
No, there's barely any Russians who aren't hackers.

378

拜托  继续找吧  好
Just keep looking, please.  Sure.

379
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,030
这不是无暇的

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,950
这是块好石头  你怎么回事

381
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,700
我是在这里工作的  别骗我

382
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,780
这颗钻石最多只有K级

383
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,120
这是H级

384
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,370
你疯了吗  这是尿黄色

385
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,750
你怎么这么粗俗  如果你父亲还活着

386
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,380
那你自己评级吧

387
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,250
所以你找不到老公

388
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,090
就像你姐姐

389
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,690
好吧
Okay.

390
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,310
丹尼的事我很遗憾
Sorry about Danny.

391
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,880
你爸爸的事我很遗憾
Sorry about your pops.

不用  谢谢
No, thank you.

397
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,760
没这么简单
A little more than that.

398
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,960
你要花多久
How long would it take you

399
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,200
能用已经切割好的原石
to make seven pieces of jewelry,

400
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,560
做七件首饰
if the stones were already cut?

401
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,300
可能要五六小时
Probably five or six hours.

402
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,500
如果我告诉你  你不用再和你妈妈
How long if I told you you didn't have to

403
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,810
住在一起了呢
live with your mother anymore?

404
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,310
再快点
Less.

405
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,310
我再也不坐F线了
I'm never taking the Ftrain again.

406
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,520
她进去了

她进哪里了
She is in where?

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,820
你说得就是这些吗  一堆花瓶
This what you talking about? Bunch of vases.

409
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,360
没错  那是埃及翅膀
Yeah, that's the Egyptian wing.

410
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,490
她黑进大都会了

监控摄像头
Security cameras.

412
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,200

416
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,970
你在这里得用真名

417
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,940
我能和你谈谈吗
Could I talk to you for a minute?

418
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,540
我要你给我找个黑客
I asked you to get me a hacker.

419
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,140
她是东海岸最棒的黑客之一

420
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,680

Oh, I'm honored...  She has other clients.

421
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,980
他们也不知道她的真名
They don't know her real name either.

422
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,550
不好意思  "其他客户"
I'm sorry, "Other clients"?

423
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,920
现在还有吗  是的
Now?  Yeah.

424
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,850
你有告诉她能分到多少钱吗
Did you tell her what her cut was?

425
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,990
当然了  然后呢
Of course.  And?

426
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,000
看  她在抽烟
Look. She's smoking!

427
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,740
九球
So, Nine Ball.

428
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,500
我要叫你九球  九...
Uh, do I call you Nine Ball? Nine...

429
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,140
或者球手
Or Baller.

430
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,210
球手  好吧
Baller? Okay. Okay.

431
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,680
你知道你的足迹一团糟吧
You know your footprint is a disaster, right?

432
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,850
抱歉  什么  你的足迹
I'm sorry, what?  Your footprint.

433
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,190
我的足迹  没错  女士
My footprint?  Yes, ma'am.

434
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,660
如果你想偷东西
If you're planning to steal shit,

435
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,160
你可得清理干净
you definitely got to clean this up,

436
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,190
现在  我的小妹妹都能黑了你们
'cause right now, my little sister could hack you.

437
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,930
好吧  因为我们有个人...
Oh, right. 'Cause we had this guy...

438
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,900
明白了
Gotcha.

439
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,170
我们会清理的
We'll clean that up.

440
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,880
我能问问我们要去哪里吗  待会就知道了
Can I ask where we're going?  You'll see in a minute.

441
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,410
现在  我们要去见
Right, we're going to meet

442
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,650
多丽丝·克卢格  达芙妮
Doris Kluger...  Daphne.

443
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,150
达芙妮  比她更著名的人
Daphne.  Someone even more famous.

444
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,150
会让达芙妮·克卢格嫉妒的人
Someone who makes Daphne Kluger jealous.

445
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,800
嫉妒
Jealous?

446
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,690
过一会  我们会站起来离开
In a minute, we're gonna stand up.

447
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,960
她会坐下来
She's gonna sit down.

448
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,690
你会认出她  淡定点
You'll recognize her. Just be cool.

449
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,990
高冷  但要和善
Aloof.  But kind.

450
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,160
但不能太和善  对
But not too kind.  Yeah.

451
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,200
你在出汗
You're sweating.

452
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,060
对  我很会出汗  别出
Yeah, look, I sweat.  Don't.

453
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,300
她的左手有一个纹身
On her left hand is a tattoo.

454
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,640
我要你握住它  称赞它
I want you to take it, admire it,

455
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,540
要进行身体接触  然后我们会拍下来
but make physical contact, and that's when we'll get it.

456
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,140
它  什么它
"It"? What's "It"?

457
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,820
我知道你
Oh, I know you!

458
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,690
我知道你  我见过你  我见过你很多次
Yes, I know you. I've seen you. I've seen you in things.

459
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,290
没错
Yeah.

460
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,790
不  你很棒  谢谢
No, you're good.  Oh, thank you.

461
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,090
你真的很棒  谢谢
You're really good. Yeah.  Thank you.

462
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,590
我只是很想和你说"谢谢"
Well, I just really wanted to say, "Thank you."

463
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,030
谢谢
Thank you?

464
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,070
帮助我们的猫咪救援项目
For helping us with the feline rescue project.

465
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,900
佩内洛佩·斯特恩
Penelope Stern?

466
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,140
她年纪够参加大都会晚会了吗
Is she even old enough to go to the Met Ball?

467
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,410
显然可以
Apparently.

468
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,010
谁在乎谁给她造型
Who cares who's dressing her anyway?

469
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,910
我觉得第六版在乎
Uh, I think Page Six.

470
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,980
大都会舞会搭档

471
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,290
我没见过罗斯·威尔  你说我和所有人都见过了
I never met with Rose Weil. You said I met with everybody.

472
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,160
你说她是个老古董  我是说老标杆
You said she was a relic.  I meant iconic.

473
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,430
你要我安排一次见面吗
Do you want me to set up a meeting?

474
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,060
当然了  好的
Yes!  Okay.

475
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,530
我昨晚看了她的一部电影
I watched one of her films last night.

476
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,070
她其实还真的挺不错
She's actually really good.

477
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,940
不管怎么样  不要奉承她
Whatever you do, don't fawn.

478
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,310
别理她
Just ignore her.

479
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,810
冷漠能催生欲望
Indifference, it's an aphrodisiac.

480
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,010
避免眼神接触
Very little eye contact.

481
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:57,970
罗斯
Rose.

482
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,650
达芙妮·克卢格女士  终于见面了
Daphne. Miss Kluger.  Finally.

483
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,650
谢谢你愿意在最后时刻见我
So, thank you so much for meeting me so last minute.

484
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,160
我很崇拜你  我有很多你的作品
I am such an admirer of yours. I have so many of your pieces.

485
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,630
真的吗  没错
Really?  Yeah.

486
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,830
找人...可真是不简单
So, this search... It has not been easy.

487
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,330
我们看了这么多人
And everything we've seen,

488
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,600
他们都很不错
you know, it's been great.

489
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,230
但是都疲劳了
But it's been tired

490
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,140
你看上去很不一样
and you just seem different.

491
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,410
你好像不在意外界评价
You know, like you're immune to judgment.

492
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,080
仿佛完全超脱了
Like you're above all that.

493
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
抱歉  怎么回事
I'm sorry, what?

494
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,350
你怎么回事
What is going on?

495
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,160
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

496
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,360
你说什么
Um, what were you saying?

497
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,560
我想雇你做我大都会晚会的设计师
I'm trying to hire you for the Met Ball.

498
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,140
太好了  谢谢你  我很荣幸
Great. Thank you. My honor.

499
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,070
受宠若惊
Flattered.

500
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,530
先别说得太早  半路杀出达芙妮

501
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,170
你看到就知道了
Wait till you see.

502
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,410
这姑娘有一双我所见过最妙的手
This girl has some of the best hands I've ever seen.

503
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,340
这人正常吗
Is this one sane?

504
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,180
完全正常
Hundred percent.

505
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,610
好了  玩法是这样的
All right, here's how we're playing.

506
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,950
红色就有钱
Red is money, okay?

507
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,320
真的吗  三牌赌一张
Really? Threecard Monte?

508
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,250
跟着皇后  实现梦想
Follow the Queen, live your dream.

509
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,620
不过你可别睡着了  别睡着了
But don't sleep. Don't sleep.

510
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,490
因为她可能会消失  看到了吗
'Cause she might disappear, you saw that?

511
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,630
不见了吧
It's lit, right?

512
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,330
但她会回来  她喜欢你
She came back, though. She likes you.

513
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,400
好了  开始吧  跟着皇后
All right, let's hit it. And we're following the Queen.

514
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,200
我们跟着皇后
And we're following the Queen.

515
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,470
只能选她了吗
Is this our only choice?

516
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,400
小偷的营业额可不是小数
The turnover in pickpockets is huge.

517
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,910
她在哪里  这贱人在哪里
Where she at? Where that bitch at?

518
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,240
她在哪里
Where she at?

519
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
那个
That one.

520
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,810
百分百肯定就是那张了吗
Wanna call a lifeline on that one?

521
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,650
不  那张
No. That one.

522
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,950
好了  那是我的了
All right. That one is mine.

523
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,750
好了  别难过
Come on, there's no hard feelings.

524
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,020
你真的很厉害  懂我意思吗
And you're a real one, you know? You know what I mean?

525
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,790
欢迎你随时回来
Yeah, come back any time.

526
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,530
不赖  我就说吧
Not bad.  Yeah. I thought so.

527
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,100
火鸡和伏洛干酪
Turkey and provolone, please.

528
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,300
所以  我要偷一条项链
So, I'm lifting one necklace.

529
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,530
一条很不错的项链
It's a very nice necklace.

530
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,110
生菜和番茄
Uh, lettuce and tomato.

531
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,910
钱是合法的吗  百分百合法
And this is legit, the money?  Hundred percent.

532
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,580
好  我加入  很好
Okay, I'm in.  Great.

533
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,020
能把我的手表还给我吗
Uh, can I get my watch back, please?

534
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,630
谢谢  还有她的
Thank you. And hers as well.

535
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,230
不  我...
No, I...

536
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,330
抱歉  没关系
Sorry.  It's okay.

537
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,330
我们有谁  我们有谁
Who do we have, who do we have?

538
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,170
艾薇呢  不  还在监狱里
What about Ivy?  No, still in jail.

539
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,870
真的吗  他呢
Really?  What about him?

540
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,040
那是男的  所以呢
Well, he's a him.  So?

541
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,340
不要男的
Don't want a him.

542
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,240
因为是他还是因为是"他"
Because it's a him or because it's a "Him"?

543
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,680
不  他不是什么重要人物
No, he's not a "Him."

544
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,210
我基本不认识他  那男的怎么了
I barely know the guy.  What's wrong with a him?

545
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,650
男的惹人注目  女的就不会
A him gets noticed, a her gets ignored,

546
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,780
这一次  我们不想引人注目
and for once, we wanna be ignored.

547
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,180
塔米呢
What about Tammy?

548
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,870
伙计
Hey, buddy,

549
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,370
能帮我个忙吗  你能出去玩吗
can you do me a favor? Can you take that outside?

550
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,450
黛比  我和我的家人在一起
Debbie, I am with my family.

551
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,720
我跟你说了...  我在外面
I told you...  I'm outside.

552
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,880
什么  我在你家车库
What?  I'm in your garage.

553
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,290
黛布
Deb?

554
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,830
黛布  你在这里干什么  我以为你在监狱
Deb, what are you doing here? I thought you were in jail.

555
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,200
我出来了
Mmm. I got out.

556
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,640
看看这些东西  我还以为你退休了呢
Look at all this. Thought you retired?

557
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,600
我是退休了
I did.

558
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,270
从加拿大偷运洗碗机
Not as exciting as hijacking trucks

559
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,410
总没有劫卡车来得刺激吧
that are smuggling dishwashers from Canada, right?

560
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,180
我已经不干了
Yeah, well, I don't do that anymore.

561
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,480
但是你很擅长
But you were so very good at it.

562
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,310
谢谢  嗯
Thank you.  Yeah.

563
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,450
这些都是你自己用的吗
So these are all for personal use, right?

564
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,120
你想要什么  就是想叙叙旧
What do you want?  Just wanna reconnect.

565
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,180
叙旧
Reconnect?

566
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,090
你一点都不无聊  对吧  塔塔
You're not bored out here, are you, TamTam?

567
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,090
对  我一点也不无聊
No, I'm not bored out here at all.

568
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,760
很好  很好  不无聊
Good, good.  No.

569
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,430
你为什么这么问  因为我需要一个销赃的
Why would you ask that?  Because I need a fence.

570
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,540
我告诉你我已经不干了  我退出了
Well, I told you I don't do that anymore. I'm out.

571
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,300
这是桩大活  我不在乎
It's a big job.  I don't care.

572
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,740
你要我告诉你这活有多大吗
Do you want me to tell you how big a job it is?

573
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,370
不  不  我不想听
No. No, I really don't.

574
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,540
我觉得我还是要告诉你这活有多大吧
I think I'm gonna tell you how big the job is.

575
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,350
你在开玩笑吗  没有
Are you kidding?  No.

576
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,590
妈妈  晚餐什么时候好啊  该死
Mommy, when's dinner ready?  Shit!

577
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,720
亲爱的  我马上来
Uh, sweetheart, I will be right there.

578
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,990
对不起  妈妈马上来
I'm so sorry. Mommy will be right there.

579
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,790
但是我好饿
But I'm hungry!

580
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,360
我知道  亲爱的  我保证我马上来
I know, sweetheart, I promise, I will be right there.

581
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,400
真是谢谢你了  她听上去很乖
Thanks a lot.  She sounds sweet.

582
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,210
这些都是怎么和你丈夫解释的
How do you explain all this to your husband?

583
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,380
网上淘的
eBay.

584
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,570
好了  大家伙儿  开始吧
Okay, everybody. Let's get started.

585
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,940
让我们给你们
We would like to present to you all

586
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:32,130
五月第一个周一

587
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,680
假设一种情况
with a hypothetical situation.

588
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,620
有多假设  不算太假设  除非我们搞砸了
How hypothetical?  Not very, unless we screw up.

589
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,650
每人的银行账户五周后
$16.5 million in each of your bank accounts,

590
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,250
多1650万美元
five weeks from now.

591
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,060
三周半后
In three and a half weeks,

592
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,790
大都会博物馆将会举办年度晚会
the Met will be hosting its annual ball,

593
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,290
庆祝他们的新展
celebrating its new costume exhibit,

594
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,900
而我们要去抢一笔
and we are going to rob it.

595
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,630
不是劫博物馆
Not the ball itself,

596
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,430
而是晚会上出现的
but a very important set of diamonds

597
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,570
一套非常珍贵的钻石
that will be attending the ball.

598
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,340
将会戴在达芙妮·克卢格的脖子上
On the neck of Daphne Kluger.

599
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,740
罗斯将会负责她的造型
Who Rose will be dressing.

600
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,510
杜桑  很好
The Toussaint?  Very good.

601
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,740
等达芙妮一不小心上了我们的贼船
Once Daphne is inadvertently onboard,

602
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,040
我们就可以把项链从卡地亚保险库拿出来
we can then get the necklace out of the Cartier vault,

603
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,980
黑掉大都会艺术博物馆安保系统  拜托你了  九球
hack the Met security system, thank you, Nine Ball,

604
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,450
潜入慈善晚会
and infiltrate the Gala,

605
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,490
最高级的晚会之一...
considered to be one of the most exclusive...

606
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,520
是最高级的
The most exclusive.

607
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,760
美国最高级的晚会邀请函
The most exclusive party invitation in America.

608
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,260
回家准备好你们的东西
So go home, get your affairs in order,

609
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,330
因为明天我们就要开始
because tomorrow, we begin pulling off

610
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,900
史上最大的珠宝抢劫行动
one of the biggest jewelry heists in history.

611
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,410
你要去哪里  我要去大城市
Where are you going?  I'm going to the big city.

612
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,880
多久  不太久  我保证
How long?  Uh, not too long, I promise.

613
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,790
我很快就会回来了
I'll be back before you know it.

614
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,390
你去做什么
What are you gonna do?

615
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,850
我要帮我朋友黛比的忙
I am going to help my friend Debbie with her job.

616
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,490
帮什么忙
What kind of job?

617
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,630
很复杂  我能跟你一起去吗
It's complicated.  Can I come with you?

618
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,330
不行  亲爱的  这是妈妈的特别出差
No, sweetie, this is Mommy's very special work trip.

619
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,570
是我的账户  我的钱
It is my account, it is my money,

620
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,030
我不能进入的唯一原因
and the only reason I can't access it

621
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,900
是因为我记不得我第二个表亲
is because I cannot remember the make and model

622
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,570
第一辆车的品牌和型号
of my second cousin's first car.

623
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,640
你能不能...
So if you could just...

624
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,440
我不想取钱
I don't wanna make a withdrawal,

625
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,680
我想存钱
I would like to make a deposit.

626
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,180
是的  我...
Yes, I...

627
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,010
我能...
Hey, can I...

628
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,550
没错  是的  我不会挂的  怎么了
Exactly, yes. Yes, I'll hold. What's up?

629
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,560
能不能给我一张地铁卡
Oh, hey, I was wondering if I can get a MetroCard,

630
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,890
因为我每天都从皇后区滑滑板过来
'cause I'm skateboarding in from Queens every day.

631
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,330
能给我一张地铁卡吗
Can I get a MetroCard?

632
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,030
我没有地铁卡
I don't have a MetroCard.

633
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,300
你没有地铁卡吗
You don't have a MetroCard?

634
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,530
我没有地铁卡
I don't have a MetroCard.

635
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,200
你是游客吗
What are you, a tourist?

636
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,670
你真有意思
You're fascinating.

637
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,140
你只给我二十美金
You're gonna just throw me one dub

638
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,540
买地铁卡吗  就这么多吗
for a MetroCard? That's it?

639
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,940
这样如何  我们偷五千万
How about this? We steal $50 million,

640
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,350
我给每个人都买一张地铁卡  怎么样
I'll buy everybody MetroCards. How's that?

641
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,550
好吧
Okay.

642
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,350
那是你哥哥吗  嗯
Is that your brother?  Mmmhmm.

643
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,750
他很帅  嗯
He's hot.  Mmm.

644
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,320
你确定他死了还是...
You sure he's dead or...

645
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,560
不确定
No.

646
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,230
是的  亲爱的  妈妈在做新工作了
Yes, sweetie, Mommy is in her new job now.

647
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,300
查理  你能帮我个忙吗
Charlie, will you do me a favor?

648
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,970
你能把那个放到那里吗
Can you put that right there?

649
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,870
什么  亲爱的
What, sweetheart?

650
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,540
是这样的...妈妈的工作是
Um, uh, well... Mommy...

651
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,440
发现非常特别的玩具
finds very special toys,

652
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,770
然后为它们找到新家
and then she finds new homes for them.

653
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,680
没错  就像你的乌龟  完全正确
Yes, exactly like your turtle. That is exactly right.

654
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,450
太感谢你了  查理  谢谢
Thank you so much, Charlie, thank you.

655
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,850
亲爱的  我得挂了
Sweetheart, I have to go.

656
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,580
我刚刚给黛比找了一个全新的玩具
I just got a brand new toy for Debbie,

657
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,250
我等不及要拿去玩了
and I can't wait to play with it.

658
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,570
锆石
Zirconium.

659
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,100
我喜欢  我知道你会喜欢的
I like it.  Yeah, I bet you do.

660
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,270
放开那个男人
Unhand the man.

661
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,440
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

662
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,910
这是给你的特制眼镜
Here are your very special glasses.

663
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,810
假如罗斯能搞定  我是说假如
If Rose can pull this off, and that is a very big "If",

664
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,250
这副眼镜会扫描真项链
these glasses will scan the real necklace

665
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,450
然后把数字图像发给我们
and send a digital print back to us here.

666
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,090
一旦我们有了那个
Once we have that,

667
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,420
这个东西会用锆
this thing will print

668
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,490
打印出项链的复制品
a replica of the necklace in zirconium.

669
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,060
卡蒂亚

670
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,460
在哪里  这些不是杜桑
Where is it?  These are not the Toussaint.

671
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,320
我们以为你们可能想先看看这些
We thought you might want to see these first.

672
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,730
为什么
Right. What for?

673
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,430
那条项链的运输有些问题
There are certain logistical problems with that necklace.

674
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,370
我们都不知道如何投保
We wouldn't even know how to insure it.

675
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,100
好吧
All right.

676
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,500
"我们在电话上说得很清楚"
"We were very clear on the phone."

677
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,870
没错  我们在电话上说得很清楚
Yes. We were very clear on the phone.

678
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,040
我们只对杜桑感兴趣
We are only interested in the Toussaint.

679
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,480
没错
Yeah.

680
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,920
那样的话要谈很久了
Well, then, that would have to be a much longer discussion.

681
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,920
那条项链价值1.5亿美金
That necklace is valued at over $150 million.

682
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,460
我不太擅长跟数字打交道
Well, I'm not really a numbers person.

683
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,130
它需要专门的安保团队
It would require its own security team,

684
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,600
重新投保
a new insurance policy.

685
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,770
我敢确定你们肯定会解决这些细节问题的
I'm sure you'll work out all those details.

686
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,200
没那么简单
Oh, it's not that simple.

687
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,840
恐怕答案是不行
I'm afraid the answer is no.

688
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,410
不行吗
No?

689
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,010
不行
No.

690
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,150
听着  我能说句实话吗
Look, can I be frank?

691
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,850
我一直很喜欢卡地亚
I have always loved Cartier.

692
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,990
我觉得这里过去一直是史上
I think, historically, this has been

693
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,590
世界上最重要的公司
the most significant house in the world.

694
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,360
但是外面有一整代人
But there is whole generation out there

695
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,100
连公司的名字都念不准
who mispronounce your name.

696
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,060
法语很难
French can be difficult.

697
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,500
不  并不是

698
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,380
听着  我想要帮你...

699
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,540
如果你不想要我的帮助  我懂...

700
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,050
但是"杜桑"这样对你没好处

701
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,170
躺在保险库里...

702
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,180
它本可以...

703
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,430
让全世界为止痴迷...

704
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,180
挂在达芙妮·克卢格的大胸前

705
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,590
对
Oui.

706
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,650
无信号

707
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,950
别敲了
Stop it.

708
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,720
别敲了  没用的  住手  好吧  好吧
Stop it. That doesn't help. Stop.  Okay, all right. All right.

709
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,760
她们在地下太深了  接收不到信号
We're too far underground. Can't get a signal.

710
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,570
下面很安全啊
Very secure down here, huh?

711
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,800
五英尺厚实心混凝土
Five feet of solid concrete.

712
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,280
你说你想在光线下欣赏
You said you wanted to see it in the light.

713
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,410
你说你想在光线下欣赏项链
You wanted to see the necklace in the light.

714
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,620
没错
Right!

715
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,980
这有光线
This is light.

716
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,290
不不不  她说的是真正的光  自然光
No, no, no, she means real light. Natural light, yes.

717
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,020
走红毯是在太阳没下山的时候
The red carpet happens while the sun is still out.

718
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,060
不
Yes, no,

719
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,390
我认为这很重要  很重要
I'm afraid that's vital.  It's vital.

720
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,930
没错  我得在阳光下欣赏
Mmm. No, I must have the sun.

721
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,030
她一定要有阳光
She must have the sun.

722
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,640
这个光线怎么样  威尔女士  嗯...
How is this light, Ms. Weil?  Um...

723
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,780
很好  我们有阳光了
Yes, I think, yes, we have the sun.

724
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,110
好多了
Much better.

725
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,150
扫描中

726
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,050
有了  太好了
There it is!  All right.

727
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,120
你好  尤物
Hello, sexy.

728
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,640
快点  快点
Come on, come on.

729
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,140
威尔女士  她没事吧
Ms. Weil. Is she okay?

730
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,780
她没事  嗯
She's fine.  Hmm.

731
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,410
她得靠近看
She needs to take it in.

732
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,720
她就是这样
This is her process.

733
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,490
看起来非常棒
It looks really good.

734
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,160
太清楚了  没错
It's so clear.  Yeah.

735
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,760
快点
Come on.

736
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,060
不  好的  你得...
No, okay. You gotta...

737
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,200
不  好的
No. Yep.

738
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,600
如果你看好了  威尔女士...
If you are done, Ms. Weil...

739
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,640
...我们得...
...we'd like to...

740
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,770
...把项链送回保险库
...return this to the vault.

741
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,970
威尔女士
Ms. Weil?

742
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
威尔女士
Ms. Weil.

743
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,750
太棒了
Yes!

744
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,080
看好了
I'm done.

745
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,720
太棒了
Sweet.

746
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,130
天啊
Oh, my God!

747
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,040
好看吗  我说不好
Well?  I don't know.

748
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,080
你没感觉是因为这件只是用平纹细布做的样板
Well, you don't know because this is only a muslin.

749
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,850
首先  礼服会是粉色的
It's going to be pink, for a start.

750
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,820
我知道会是粉色的  但我感觉有哪里不对劲
I know it's going to be pink, but I don't know.

751
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,250
我觉得好像是腰部
Yeah, I feel like it's the waist.

752
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,490
我觉得腰部有点...还有臀部
I feel, like, it's just... And then the bottom.

753
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,820
我不太清楚臀部是不是合身
I don't know about the bottom.

754
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,150
我们可以改一下褶边
We can definitely change the hem.

755
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,560
是因为项链  不
It's the necklace.  Oh, no.

756
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,620
不是因为项链  就是因为项链
It's not the necklace.  It is the necklace.

757
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,430
很难看
It's just messy.

758
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,590
不不不  不难看
No, no, no, it's not messy.

759
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,300
难看是因为它是别针做的
It's messy 'cause it's safety pins.

760
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,830
不  你不要忘了钻石
No, you must remember the diamonds.

761
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,300
项链是钻石做的
It's gonna be diamonds.

762
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,970
我感觉我看起来很胖
I just feel like I look huge.

763
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,400
达芙妮  冷静  冷静  冷静
Hey, Daphne, come here. Come here. Come here.

764
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,910

766
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,850
你的脖子是世界上最好看的
You've got one of the greatest necks in the world.

767
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,350
事实上  你的脖子是唯一
In fact, you've got the only neck

768
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,350
配得上这条项链的
that could carry this necklace off.

769
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,260
搭配你的脖子  这条项链...
With your neck, this necklace...

770
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:49,960
你将戴着它去参加大都会艺术博物馆慈善晚会
You are gonna walk into that Met Gala, and you

771
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,230
你将照亮天空

772
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,470
谢谢
Thank you.

773
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,270
不客气
You're welcome.

774
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,640
如果你喜欢他  就向右滑
If you like him, you go right,

775
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,840
如果不喜欢...
and if you don't...

776
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,110
向左滑  没错  向左滑
I go left.  Yeah, you go left.

777
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,510
所以...  好的  听起来很容易
So...  Okay, that sounds easy.

778
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,220
那你喜欢他吗  我非常喜欢他
So do you like him?  Ooh. I like him a lot.

779
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,550
为什么
Okay, why?

780
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,920
他看上去很和善
He looks kind.

781
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,490
我要向右滑
I'm gonna swipe right.

782
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,350
配对成功  发送信息  继续滑动

783
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,420
好吧  天啊
Okay. All right.  Oh, my God!

784
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,690
这就是说...
So does that mean...

785
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,030
他也向右滑了  他也喜欢你
He liked you back! He likes you, too!

786
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,190
现在怎么办  现在怎么办
What happens now? What happens now?

787
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,130
你可以给他发信息  好的
So you can message him.  Okay.

788
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:27,030
你可以给他发送茄子的表情
And you can say, maybe, like, the eggplant emoji,

789
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,100
或者发做这个动作的女孩表情
or maybe the girl that does this.

790
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,090
打扰一下
Excuse me.

791
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,550
能帮我一下吗
Can you help me with something?

792
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,620
我有点迷路了
I think I'm a little lost.

793
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,860
当然  女士
Of course, ma'am.

794
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,160
我觉得我在绕圈
I feel like I'm going in circles.

795
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,790
我从埃及展区过来
I came from Egypt back there,

796
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,530
我要去海洋餐厅

797
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,660
是会让人有点晕
It's a little confusing.

798
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,160
你可以从右边的楼梯下去

799

或者可以回到进来的地方

就在那下面  好的

801
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,800
可能有点远
It might take a little bit longer.

802
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,500
失陪一下  女士
Excuse me, ma'am.

803

这怎么可能

他在泰特美术馆[英国]也干了

无法阻止像班克西这样的人...

817
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,380
先生  我们更注重的是

818
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,890
东西不被盗走  而不是被偷偷放进来

按照协议内容办事

834
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,750
我们将彻底检查一次系统

既然我们知道他们

要更改他们的系统

841
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,970
我们也可以做一些改动  避免被发现

842
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,370
你能把摄像头拉近一点吗

他们的镜头覆盖了每一个角落

但是我们不在这里下手

845
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,510
我们要在他们想都没想过的地方下手
We are gonna do it in a spot they don't even care about.

846
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,510
九球
Nine Ball.

847
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,350
纽约州的法律规定
Now it's a New York State law

848
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,580
任何公共洗手间内都不能安装摄像头
that no cameras can be mounted in a public bathroom.

849
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,020
那显然是侵犯个人隐私
Apparently, it's a privacy violation.

850
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,250
除非你喜欢侵犯
Unless you're into that.

851
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,590
我们一旦拿到"杜桑"
And once we get the Toussaint,

852
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,720
我们可以从那里把它弄走
we are gonna have to get it out of there

853
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,650
而不被发现
without being detected,

854
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,890
如果他们非常细致地
and they're gonna go over

855
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,390
检查他们的监控录像
their security footage with a finetooth comb,

856
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,130
从那个洗手间出来的任何人
and anyone seen exiting that bathroom

857
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,330
都会成为嫌疑犯
is gonna be a suspect.

858
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,000
所以...
So...

859
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
所以我们要有个带货的
So we get a mule.

860
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,400
别人可以帮我们带出来
Somebody else is gonna move it for us.

861
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,140
你在洗手间外面需要多少空间
How much space do you need outside

862
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,240
才能把东西藏到别人身上
that bathroom to plant it on somebody?

863
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:31,610
不知道  九英尺行吗
I don't know. Nine feet?

864
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,110
我们要多长时间
And how long is it gonna take us

865
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,780
可以建立九英尺的监控盲区
to build a ninefoot blind spot?

866
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,310
移动摄像头吗  嗯
Moving a camera?  Mmmhmm.

867
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,590
一点一点  需要10到12天
Bit by bit, 10, 12 days.

868
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,690
太好了
Great.

869
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,920
你策划这些花了多长时间
How long did it take you to figure all this out?

870
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,130
5年8个月12天
Five years, eight months, and 12 days.

871
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,800
大概这么久
Give or take.

872
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,100
卡地亚雇了
Cartier has hired

873

led the pope's security for 10 years.

876
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,210
众所周知  从来没有教皇被杀
And as you know, they've never lost a pope.

879
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,550
我非常肯定他们是杀手
I'm pretty sure they're assassins.

880
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,020
项链真的很漂亮  没错
Well, it's a nice necklace.  Yeah.

881
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,220
你可以把他们加入你的清单
So you can go ahead and just add them to your list.

882
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,060
什么清单  那个清单
What list?  That list.

883
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,660
这不是清单

不客气  谢谢你给我面试机会
Oh, of course. Thank you for having me.

916
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,480
我猜你肯定听说了  我们的一名协调员去世了
I guess you heard, we lost one of our coordinators.

917
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,120
听起来很糟糕

920
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,950
那些到底是什么  好像是螨虫
What are those anyway?  It's like a mite, I think.

921
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,560
它钻进皮肤  在里面产卵
It burrows into the skin and lays its eggs inside.

922
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,760
然后它们孵化后再钻出来
And then they hatch and they dig their way out.

923
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,000
显然可以持续好几周
Apparently, it can last for weeks.

谢谢
Thank you.

926
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,970
也许还有点资历过高
Maybe overqualified.

927
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,170
怎么会有人资历过高呢
Well, how can anyone be overqualified?

Excuse me.  Yes?

950
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,780
刚才经过的是洗手间吗
Was that the bathroom that we passed?

951
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,250
对  就在走廊尽头
Oh, yes, just down the hall.

男伴是谁
Who's her date?

The ego has landed.

987
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,620
你以前怎么会爱上这种蠢货
How did you ever fall for this schmuck?

988
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,520
说真的
Seriously?

989
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,530
我和卢以前过得很苦
Lou and I were going through a rough patch,

990
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:32,330
而我真的想自己闯一番天地
and I really wanted a big score of my own.

991
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:33,660
他拉拢了你
So he roped you in?

992
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,900
也不是
Mmm. Not really.

993
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,200
怎么  他跟你说了实话
What, told you the truth?

994
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,070
只有这样才能骗到一个骗子  不是吗
Only way to con a con, right?

995
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:52,920
我和卢当时在装配宾果游戏
Lou and I were rigging Bingo
十年前
新泽西州  帕塞伊克
西部宾果游戏厅

996
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,550
还在轮盘赌局里骗点小钱
and running cheap cons at Roulette.

997
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,760
运气好的话一晚上能赚一千
Lucky if we made $1,000 a night.

998
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,060
宾果  有人胜出
Bingo!  Bingo call.

999
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,230
我的一个朋友给我介绍了这位艺术商
So a friend of mine set me up with this art dealer

1000
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,200
我们琢磨出了一个简单的骗局
and we worked out a simple little hustle.

1001
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,960
我找克劳德·贝克  那边
Claude Becker?  Right through there.

1002
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,130
谢谢
Thank you.

1003
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,600
你好  我是黛比
Hi. I'm Debbie.

1004
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,870
克劳德·贝克
Claude Becker.

1005
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,770
当有人对某件作品感兴趣的时候
When somebody got interested in a piece,

1006
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,780
我就扮作另一个买家抬高价格
I'd pose as another buyer and drive up the price.

1007
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,720
赚到的数目很不错  他的厨艺也很好
Money was good and he was great in the kitchen.

1008
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,190
天哪  真美味
Oh, my God, it's so good.

1009
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,490
有一天
One day

1010
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:34,530
他让我扮作卖家  而不是买家
he asked me to pose as the seller, not the buyer.

1011
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,230
你怎么做
What did you do?

1012
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,830
这个嘛
Well...

1013
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,100
一个签名  价值50万
One signature, half a million dollars.

1014
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,570
他说那很简单
He said it was simple.

1015
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,410
我把证明文件给他们  他们就给我一张支票
I'd hand them the documents, and they'd slide me a check.

1016
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:56,920
最多几分钟就能搞定
The whole thing would take a couple minutes, tops.

1017
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:07,360
抱歉我们来晚了
Sorry we're late.

1018
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,890
不晚  没关系
Not at all.  It's okay.

1019
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,260
幸会  幸会
Very nice to meet you.  It's a pleasure.

1020
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,100
作品很美  我们很喜欢
It's a beautiful piece.  Oh, we just love it!

1021
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,230
他说对了  的确很快
He was right. It all happened very quickly.

1022
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,700
你有权请律师
You have a right to an attorney.

1023
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,370
如果你请不起律师...
If you cannot afford an attorney...

1024
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,510
那不是我的画  画是她拿来的
It wasn't my painting. She brought the picture to me.

1025
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,570
证明文件和签名都是她搞的
She had documentation, signatures.

1026
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,140
你们是恋爱关系吗
And you two were dating?

1027
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,510
什么
What?

1028
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,710
我什么也不会说的
Not saying a word.

1029
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,980
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1030
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:37,990
因为他的嘴可不像你这么紧
'Cause he's not being quite as tightlipped as you are.

1031
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,960
这些是你的签字吗
Are these your signatures?

1032
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,800
好  我会作证的
Yeah, I will testify.

1033
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,330
我也被骗了  好吗
I was defrauded too, right?

1034
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,830
我就在外面
I'll be right outside.

1035
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,300
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

1036
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,500
你最好告诉我事情不是我想的那样
You better tell me this is not what I think this is.

1037
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,610
什么
What?

1038
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,080
克劳德·贝克
Claude Becker.

1039
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,980
不是我干的
I didn't do that.

1040
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,740
我不是庄荷  好吗
I'm not a croupier, okay?

1041
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,450
也不是口袋里响叮当的游客
Or a tourist with a bucket of quarters.

1042
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:37,810
别想骗我
Don't con me.

1043
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,980
你不能设局中局
You do not run a job in a job!

1044
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,720
没关系的
It's not going to matter.

1045
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,220
我们会被抓的
We are going to get caught.

1046
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,390
别说了  不会的
Stop it. We're not.

1047
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,660
你为什么要这么做
Why do you do this?

1048
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,090
就不能好好干桩活吗
Why can't you just do a job?

1049
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,000
为什么非得加点别的
Why does there always have to be an asterisk?

1050
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,030
你设计他  我不干了
You frame him, I walk.

1051
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,140
别这样
Stop.

1052
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,700
和上一回一模一样
This is just like last time.

1053
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,040
卢  卢
Lou. Lou!

1054
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,440
卢
Lou.

1055
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,810
他害我进了监狱
He sent me to jail!

1056
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,150
你无法想象我的感受
You have no idea what that's like.

1057
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:17,520
好吧  他会故技重施的
Yeah, well, he's gonna do it again.

1058
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,230
不  他不会的
No, he's not.

1059
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,330
不会的
He's not.

1060
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,310
很好  切换摄像头
Good. Switching cameras.

1061
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,290
我现在走向洗手间
Walking towards the bathroom.

1062
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,230
好  进去盲区
Okay, in the blind spot.

1063
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,430
我继续往前走
I'm gonna keep walking.

1064
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,260
没有
Nothin'.

1065
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:03,700
没有
Nothin'.

1066
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,340
好了  你出现在监控里了
Okay, you're right there.

1067
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,750
30.5厘米  干得漂亮
12 feet. Nice job!

1068
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,550
谢了  九球
Thank you, Nine Ball.

1069
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,390
很简单  小事一桩
That easy. Don't mention it.

1070
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,420
对你来说有难的吗
What's hard?

1071
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,600
抱歉  我知道这个
Sorry, listen, I know this really

1072
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,900
跟我没什么关系...
isn't any of my business...

1073
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,060
不  你说
No, go ahead.

1074
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:36,600
只是有点小问题
It's just a little red flag here.

1075
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,940
这个酒席承办公司没有配营养专家
But this caterer doesn't have a nutritional specialist.

1076
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,440
好的  我们手头
Okay.  And we're running

1077
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,570
有20%的餐点必须特别配餐
at 20% special meals.

1078
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,610
素食  无麸质  低钠  去乳糖
Vegan, glutenfree, low sodium, lactose.

1079
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,640
我以前有个客户因此被告了
I had a client get sued.

1080
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,080
真的吗  对
Really?  Yeah.

1081
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,750
我觉得我们得做好一切准备
I don't think we should wing any of this stuff.

1082
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,650
我觉得我们缺个人
I think we are short a staff person.

1083
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,980
得找个营养学家
We need a nutritionist.

1084
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,650
我倒是认识一个人  是吗
I do know someone.  You do?

1085
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:55,920
对  她很厉害
Yeah, and she's great.

1086
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,490
她刚从澳大利亚搬来
She just moved here from Australia.

1087
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,590
对
Yes.

1088
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,130
好的  去吧
Okay. Go.

自动售货机  走廊  走廊

1090
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:08,430
路过礼堂
Past the auditorium.

1091
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,170
走廊  走廊  走廊  入口
Hallway, hallway, hallway, entry.

1092
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,240
我来了  抱歉来晚了  路上太堵了
Hi, hi! I'm so sorry I'm late. Traffic was horrible.

1093
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,810
好吧
Okay...

1094
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:20,840
阿米塔  谢谢
Amita.  Thank you.

1095
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,380
康斯坦丝

00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,880
九球
Nine Ball.

1097
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,990

1098
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,890

1099
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,290

还有黛比你的  谢谢
And Debbie.  Thank you.

1101
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,360
大家好  我是达芙妮·克卢格
Hi, I'm Daphne Kluger,

1102
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,500
接下来是今年晚会的定制时装  让我们先睹为快
and this is your sneak peek of this year's Costume Institute.

1103
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,800
这是D&G的  那是加利亚诺为迪奥的设计
This is Dolce and that's Galliano for Dior.

1104
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,800
那个是麦昆的
And that is McQueen.

1105
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,340
明天谁为你造型呢
And who's dressing you tomorrow?

1106
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,640
罗斯·威尔
Mmm. Rose Weil.

1107
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,070
有意思的选择  我知道
Interesting.  I know.

1108
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,780
算是个意外的选择
I kind of thought it was an unexpected choice.

1109
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,980
这些是什么
What's this over here?

1110
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:59,110
来自八个欧洲皇室家族的珍宝
So these are the crown jewels from eight royal families of Europe.

1111
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,620
所以这里才会有个水池
Which is probably why there's a moat.

1112
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,090
我们不能过去看吗  天哪  当然不行
So we can't go over there?  No. God, no.

1113
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:04,860
我希望我们可以  话说回来
I wish we could. Anyway...

1114
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,390
这些都是我们问德里特里·某某借来的
Uh, they are on loan to us from Dmitri

1115
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:10,090
那个俄罗斯名字太长我不会念
VeryLongRussianLastName that I can't pronounce.

1116
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,790
我们听说晚会中展示的珠宝
We hear those aren't the only jewels

1117
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,930
不仅仅只有这些
that'll be on display.

1118
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,660
谁告诉你的  我有渠道
Who told you?  I have sources.

1119
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,970
好吧  既然风声已经走漏了...
Well, since the cat's already out of the bag...

1120
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,970
是的  我将会佩戴一条
Yes, I will be wearing a necklace

1121
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,110
卡蒂亚出借的项链
that Cartier has decided to loan me.

1122
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:23,440
名叫"杜桑"
It's called the Toussaint,

1123
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,270
它已经被锁在保险箱里50年了
and it has been in a vault for 50 years.

1124
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,240
我有点兴奋
And I'm just a little excited.

1125
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,450
你试戴过了吗  也许
Have you tried it on already?  Maybe.

1126
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,220
有多少克拉  够多了
How many carats is it?  Enough.

1127
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:40,590
五月的第一个周一

1128
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,190
口红颜色  你觉得怎么样
Lipstick. What do you think?

1129
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,500
粉色  娃娃粉
Pink. Um, yeah. Barbie.

1130
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,500

In a good way.

1131
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:23,570

Thank you.

1132
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,970

It's here.  Right. Finally. Great.

1133
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,410

All right.

1134
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:36,250
你还没看过  没有
Oh, you haven't seen it.  No.

1135
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,980
你好  你好
Hello.  Hello.

1136
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:47,260
真是个大箱子
Ooh. That's a big box.

1137
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,400
好了
All right.

1138
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,440
天哪
Holy crap!

1139
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,510
那我们
Should we, uh...

1140
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,810
我们试戴一下  看看合不合适
Let's try it on. See if it fits.

1141
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:04,940
好
Okay.

1142
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,980
我可以...  请吧
Can I, uh...  Sure.

1143
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,750
很沉
Wow. That's heavy.

1144
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,920
真的很沉
Really heavy.

1145
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,150
到我这儿来
Come to mama.

1146
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,720
可能会有点...
All right. It might be a little...

1147
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:23,190
有点凉
Just a tad cold. Right.

1148
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,860
好了
All right. Okay.

1149
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,970
我看看  好
Let me see. Right.

1150
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,570
戴好了
That goes in.

1151
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:33,940
看啊
Look at you.

1152
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,640
好了  搞定
Yep. There.

1153
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:37,140
很合适
It fits.

1154
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,180
好
All right.

1155
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,410
很合适
It fits.

1156
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,480
好了
Right, okay.

1157
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,020
先把项链取下来  我们再试试礼服
We can get it off, and then we can try the frock.

1158
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,150
好  等一下
Okay.  Um... Hang on.

1159
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,760
抱歉  你取不下来的  得让我来
Sorry, you cannot do it. I have to do it.

1160
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,190
需要特制磁铁才能取下
It requires a special magnet.

1161
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:57,290
什么  厉害
What?  Cool.

1162
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,930
特制磁铁  对
Uh, special magnet?  Yes.

1163
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,800
这招不错
That's cool.

1164
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,040
这招很妙  非常妙

1165
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:09,710

1166
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:12,710

Can I, uh...

1167
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,310
我能不能再看一次  我有点好奇
Can I just see that again, out of interest?

1168
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,720
可以  谢谢
Sure.  Thanks.

1169
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,620
真厉害
That's amazing.

1170
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,890
真不错  让我看看是怎么弄的
Great. Let me just see. So how does it work?

1171
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,230
海达·施耐德  《明镜周刊》的时尚记者
Hilda Schneider, fashion reporter, Der Spiegel.

1172
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,430
不行
No.

1173
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,630
海达·施耐德  外交官
Hilda Schneider, diplomatic attache?

1174
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,530
不行
No.

1175
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:32,830
汉莎资产公司  汉莎
Lufthansa asset?  Lufthansa.

1176
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:34,060
出问题了
Problem.

1177
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:36,630
什么问题  罗斯发来的
With?  From Rose.

1178
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,770
老天
Oh, God.

1179
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,070
别啊
Come on!

1180
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:42,470
我的天  真厉害
Oh, my God, that is amazing.

1181
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:43,910
只有用磁铁才能取下来
And you can only do it with a magnet?

1182
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,880
只有用磁铁才可以  让我看看...
Only the magnet.  Let me just see...

1183
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,340
停  回放一遍
Stop. Play it again.

1184
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:50,150
我的天  真厉害
Oh, my God, that is amazing.

1185
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,610
只有用磁铁才能取下来
And you can only do it with a magnet?

1186
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,820
只有用磁铁才可以  放大一点
Only the magnet.  Zoom in a little bit.

1187
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,630

1188
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,570
莱斯利
Leslie?

1189
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,840
姐们  我们遇到点问题
Hey, sis, we're in a bit of a jam right now,

1190
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,140
需要你帮把手
and I need your help.

1191
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,510
看起来他们用的是聚合磁铁和弹簧
So it seems like they used polymagnets and a spring.

1192
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,550
磁铁会在同一轴上
It gives you attraction and repulsion

1193
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,450
产生吸引和排斥  懂吗
in the same axis, you know?

1194
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:28,280
不太懂  磁铁聚合在一起
Not really.  Well, they're drawn together.

1195
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:31,350
但没有接触  直到你转动磁铁
But don't touch, until you rotate it,

1196
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,120
它们就会锁死
and then they lock.

1197
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,730
很厉害  我去找一对
It's real dope. I'll go get you a positive

1198
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:39,500
正极和负极回路  应该可以用
and a negative pole in a loop. That oughta work fine.

1199
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,500
你真是个小天才  姐们  谢了
You're a little genius, sis. Thank you.

1200
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,100
真的吗  她解决了
Really? She fixed it?

1201
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,870
真的吗  你还用问吗
Really? You just asked me that?

1202
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,250
好了  确认声音
Okay, you guys. Sound check.

1203
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,720

1207
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,130
卢  确认
Lou.  Check.

1208
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,980
那烂活儿忙死我了  还被警察追了
That shit was hectic. Got chased by a cop!

1209
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,680
好吧  这是我妹妹维罗妮卡  各位
Okay, so this is my sister, everyone, Veronica.

1210
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,550
你看看  疯了
Check this out. Crazy.

1211
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,960
干得漂亮  我欠你一次  小家伙
Tight. All right. I owe you one, you little shit.

1212
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,660
给我弄个新证件
Just get me a new ID.

1213
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,290
回家去吧
Go home.

1214
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:45,160
你爸妈做什么的
What do your parents do?

1215
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,770
好了  我们开始  大家都在吗
Okay, we are up. Is everybody on?

1216
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:51,270
在
Yes.

1217
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,470
好了  女士们  半小时
All right, ladies. Half an hour.

1218
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:56,610
倒计时开始
Countdown starting now.

1219
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,850
好了  首先  不需要紧张
Okay. First. No need to be nervous.

1220
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,150
监狱里的饭菜比大多数人
The food is better on the inside

1221
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,450
想象中好得多
than most people think

1222
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:08,380
就连关禁闭都算得上平静
and even solitary can be kind of peaceful.

1223
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:19,530
我只想说  谢谢你
I just wanna say, thank you.

1224
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,770
过去三周对我来说很奇妙
The last three weeks have been amazing for me,

1225
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,610
为了这个时刻我们努力了很久
and we've all worked very hard for this moment.

1226
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,410
所以无论今晚发生了什么
So whatever happens tonight,

1227
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,840
我想要你记住一件事
I want you to remember one thing,

1228
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,510
你不是为我而做这件事
you are not doing this for me.

1229
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:38,450
也不是为你自己
You are not doing this for you.

1230
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:41,580
某个地方有一个八岁的小女孩
Somewhere out there is an eightyearold girl

1231
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,660
正躺在床上  梦想着成为一个罪犯
lying in bed, dreaming of being a criminal.

1232
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:49,960
这是为她而做的
Let's do this for her.

1233
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,760
请不要与宾客随意交谈
Do not engage in informal conversation with the guests, please.

1234
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:55,670
不要随身携带手机
Do not have your cell phone on you.

1235
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,070
活动开始前  请确保手机
Please make sure your cell phone is turned in

1236
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,100
已经交至安全主管
to security prior to the start of the event.

1237
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,300
非常重要的一点
Very important.

1238
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,170
不要无精打采  不要双手抱胸
Do not slouch, cross your arms,

1239
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,470
或者把手插到口袋里
put your hands in your pockets.

1240
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:04,570
我明白今晚很长
I know it's gonna be a long night.

1241
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,640
我知道你们会感到累
I know you're gonna get tired.

1242
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:24,460
你好  你好吗
Hello.  Hello. How are you?

1243
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,990

You two know each other?  Yes.

1246
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:32,470
天哪  这是杜桑吗
My dear, is that the Toussaint?

1247
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,240
你看起来身价百万
I'd say you look like a million bucks,

1248
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,770
但这项链可是价值一亿啊
but it's more like 100 million.

1249
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,740
谢谢  不过是价值1.5亿
Thank you, it's a 150 million actually.

难以置信  今晚的亮点在哪里
Unreal. So what makes this such a fun night?

1253
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,540
你永远不知道你会见到谁
I mean, you never know who you're gonna see.

1254
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:10,140
整个世界的明星都聚集在这里
It's stars from all over the planet.

1255
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,410
你会见到演员  来自时尚产业的人

So you've conquered the court, you've conquered motherhood...

1260

我在努力  你功成名就
I'm trying.  I mean, you are succeeding.

1261
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,590

1285
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,530
非常感谢  你人真好
Thank you very much. So kind of you.

1286
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:28,140
好了  倒计时
Okay, counting down.

1287
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:32,680
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

1288
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,810
第八桌要
Need a glutenfree

1289
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,010
无麸质餐点和烤鱼
and a broiled fish for Table Eight.

1290
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:39,680
第四桌的素食在哪里
Where's the vegan for Table Four?

1291
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,520
在这
Over here.

1292
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:49,260
快送上去
Go, go, go.

1293
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,680
天啊终于来了
Oh, God!

1294
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,560
我饿死了
I'm so hungry.

1295
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:23,460
我三天都没吃东西了
Mmm. I haven't eaten anything in three days.

1296
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,700
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1297
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,170
我太失礼了吗
Am I being rude?

1298
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,830
她吃了很多
She's in deep.

1299
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,610
差不多半碗
Maybe half a bowl.

1300
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,220
这时候你必须行屈膝礼
So, you're supposed to curtsy.

1301
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:56,330
他们那儿还有个人会教你怎么行屈膝礼
They actually have a guy there to teach you how to curtsy.

1302
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:57,790
对  真的有
Yes, that's true.

1303
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,760
总之  我进去了  我弯了弯膝盖
Anyway, I go in, I'm doing this little knee bend.

1304
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,630
然后女王怒视着我
And the Queen glares at me

1305
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:04,300
对我说"这可不是屈膝礼"
and says, "That's not a curtsy."

1306
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,270
真的吗
Really?

1307
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:07,340
结果  我因为屈膝礼
So now, I am in a curtsy standoff

1308
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:08,640
跟英国女王僵持不下
with the Queen of England.

1309
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,840
还有...
And...

1310
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:14,280
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1311
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,850
嗯  我没事  没事  只是...
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just...

1312
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:18,250
你要去洗手间吗
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

1313
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,820
不用  我没事  你确定吗
No! I'm fine.  Are you sure?

1314
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,420
我因为屈膝礼跟女王...
I'm at this curtsy standoff with Queen...

1315
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,950
而她...  你没事吧
And she's...  Are you okay?

1316
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,520
没事  等一下
I'm fine. Just give me one second,

1317
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,730
等等  我得...
hold on. I just need to get this...

1318
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:31,130
你还好吧
You all right?

1319
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:48,050
好戏开始
Game on!

1320
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,060
请让一下  我们必须...
Excuse me, we need to...

1321
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,040
很好
That's good.

1322
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,740
你正在盲区边缘
Okay, you're right on the edge of the blind spot.

1323
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,610
你还好吗
Hey, you all right?

1324
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:25,280
还好吗  小可怜
You good? Oh, you poor thing.

1325
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,680
没事的  你会没事的  呼吸  呼吸
It's okay. You'll be okay. Breathe, breathe...

1326
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:31,050
呼吸  呼吸
Breathe... Breathe...

1327
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,350

01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,300

Here we go.

1330
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,660
你  过来
Hey, come here.

1331
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:42,900
这些盘子不能留在这儿
This can't be here. You need to

1332
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,170
你得马上送去厨房

1333
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,500
好的  好了  快去
No problem.  Okay, go. Go, go.

1334

You have it?  Have what?

1340
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:17,630
我抽了
Oh, I smoked it.

1341
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,870
你抽了  什么意思
What do you mean, "Smoked it"?

1342
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,100
乔什问我
You know, Josh asked,

1343
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,840
"你有没有..."
and he was like, "Hey, do you have..."

1344
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,840
他人呢  出什么事了
Guys, where is he? What's wrong?

1345
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:25,810
怎么回事
What's happening?

1346
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:28,580
他在走廊停下了  在跟人聊天
Stalled in the hallway. Chitchattin'.

1347
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,150
塔米  你得让他快走
Tammy, you got to get him moving now.

1348
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,190
我把汤放下  然后...
I'm putting the soup down, I'm like...

1349
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:41,620
喂  你们在干什么
Hey! Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?

1350
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:42,920
我们付工资不是让你们来聊天的
You're not getting paid to talk.

1351
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:45,000
快点  好  抱歉
Let's go, come on.  Yeah, sorry.

01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,070
真是千钧一发
That was intense.

1356
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,470

What?

1357
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,420

It could've fallen off back there. I'm not sure.

1359
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,460
我吐得肠子都快出来了
I was just barfing my guts out.

1360

我一直在餐桌旁坐着

We need to clear the room.  You can't do that.

1366

We need to do a full sweep.

1367

价值1.5亿的项链在此丢失了
You just lost $150 million.

1370
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:44,650

What would you do if it was a Rembrandt missing, hmm?

1371

Diamonds? Really? We're waiting around for diamonds?

1387
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:30,430
我真的得去洗手间

Was there anything you did or anyone you talked to

1395
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,010
有没有跟什么人交谈过
between your table and the bathroom?

1396
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:51,910
要是你没注意到的话
I was rather preoccupied at the time,

1397
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,520
我当时急得不行

01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,330
没有几分钟了
We don't have a few minutes.

1401
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,540
该死的
Oh, shit!

1402
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,140
他到你那儿了
He's right there.

1403
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,340
塔米  你快到了吗  你在哪里
Tammy, how close? Where are you now?

1404
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,540
在水池边
By the moat.

1405
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:23,250
塔米  把项链从水里捞起来
Tammy, pull it out of the water.

1406
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:28,520
把项链放水里  然后捞起来  快
Just plant it in the water! Just pull it out, right now!

1407
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,060
找到了
Found it!

1408
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,290
在水里  肯定是你跑的时候
It was in the water. It must have fallen off

1409
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:36,660
掉到水里了
while you were running.

1410
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,860
我看看
May I?

1411
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,330
找到了
We got it back.

1412
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:41,400
好  我马上下来
Okay. I'll come back down.

1413
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:52,440
康斯坦丝  你做得很好
Constance, you good.

1414
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:06,520
厉害
Whoa, sick!

1415
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,590
胶水还没干  胶水还没干
Uhuh. There's glue, there's glue!

1416
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,140
感觉好点了吗
Feeling better?

1417
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,480
好点了
I do now.

1418
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,510
来两杯苏格兰威士忌
Couple scotches, please.

1419
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,110
不好意思

1420
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:17,510
祝你好运

1421
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,590
我的上帝
Dear God!

1422
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:37,740
谢谢
Thank you.

1423
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,810
这里很好
Very nice.

1424
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:44,870
首先
First of all,

1425
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,470
我不是执法机构的人
I'm not a member of law enforcement.

1426
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,010
我是与保险公司合作的
I work with the insurance carrier.

1427
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,840
也就是说  我是前来调查是否存在骗保
Which means I'm either looking for fraud

1428
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:51,610
又或者鉴定项链是否是真品
or I'm looking for the real necklace.

1429
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:53,650
除此之外我都不关心
Beyond that, I couldn't care less.

1430
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:56,320
恐怕两者的答案都是否定的
I'm afraid you won't find either here.

1431
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,760
我们拭目以待  先生
We'll see about that, Monsieur...

1432
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:02,560
这位...  德拉鲁·布鲁萨尔
Monsieur?  DelarueBroussard.

1433
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,190
好的
Okay.

1434
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:05,660
劳伦斯  你觉得
Lawrence, when did you last see

1435
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,200
你最后一次见到真品是什么时候
what you believe to be the authentic item?

1436
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,870
送去大都会博物馆晚会现场的时候
When it left here for the Met Gala.

1437
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:11,600
你什么时候知道这是赝品的
When did you know this was a fake?

1438
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,300
它被送回来的那一刻
The moment it was returned.

1439
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:14,840
还有你们两位
And you two.

1440
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,340
你们一整晚
You had your eyes on the necklace

1441
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,810
都看着项链吗
the entire evening?

1442
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:19,480
除了克卢格小姐在公共卫生间里
Apart from when Miss Kluger had her

1443
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,140
不幸的身体不适事件发生时
unfortunate incident in the public toilet.

1444
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:22,310
没错
That's correct.

1445
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:24,210
你们陪同她入内了吗
Did you accompany her inside?

1446
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:25,580
那是女卫生间
It's a women's bathroom.

1447
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,880
那是条非常贵重的项链
It's a very big necklace.

1448
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,620
洗手间只有一个出入口
There is only one entrance in and out.

1449
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:31,020
我们就在门口守着
We were stationed at the door.

1450
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,950
你们检查下水管道了吗
Did you check the plumbing?

1451
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,920
没有  我检查了
No.  I did.

1452
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:36,390
好  继续往里
Okay, keep going forward.

1453
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:43,530
可以说非常干净
Squeaky clean, so to speak.

1454
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:48,570
偷走项链的人
Whoever stole this necklace

1455
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:53,610
设法逃过检测出门了
managed to get out without being detected.

1456
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:56,080
也就是说我们要找的人非常聪明
Which means we're looking for someone very smart.

1457
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,540
先生们
Gentlemen.

1458
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:59,380
我见过一匹纯种赛马
I've seen a thoroughbred racehorse

1459
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:01,580
被扔进树木粉碎机
thrown into a tree shredder.

1460
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,020
人们为了骗保
People will go to great lengths

1461
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,320
什么都干得出来
to defraud an insurance carrier.

1462
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:09,720
这个  这是什么
There! What's this?

1463
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:11,590
我说了这不是盲区
I'm saying that's not a blind spot.

1464
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,400
那是什么  洗手间
What do you call that then?  The bathroom.

1465
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,730
我看不到洗手间啊
I don't see a bathroom.

1466
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:16,700
那是...
That's...

1467
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,200
那是因为在盲区里
Because it's in the blind spot.

1468
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,670
在洗手间能偷到什么东西
What can someone steal from a bathroom anyway?

1469
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:22,670
我不知道  化妆品
I don't know, toiletries,

1470
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:24,670
薄荷糖  手巾
mints, hand towels,

1471
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,980
显然还有一条6磅重的钻石项链
a sixpound diamond necklace, apparently.

1472
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,080
这是谁
Now, who's this?

1473
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,210
一个侍者吧
A busboy?

1474
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:31,350
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

1475
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:32,720
我怎么会认识侍者
How would I know a busboy?

1476
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,180
你是上流社会的人吗
Aren't we posh?

1477
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,790
进出博物馆的每个人我不是都认识
I don't know everyone who goes in and out of the museum.

1478
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:39,420
你在意一个侍者干什么
Why do you care about a busboy?

1479
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,390
出问题的时间段里  他是唯一一个
He's the only person who moves in and out of the blind spot

1480
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:42,760
进出盲区的人
during the period in question.

1481
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,830
你能别把那里叫做盲区了吗
Could you please stop calling it a blind spot?

1482
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,730
好吧
Fine.

1483
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:49,830
由于你独特的摄像头放置
The bathroom door that we can't see

1484
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:52,300
那扇我们看不到的洗手间的门
because of your unique camera placement.

1485
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:56,100
这是世界上最先进的博物馆安保系统
This is the most sophisticated museum security in the world.

1486
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:58,610
每一件艺术品旁都设有多个角度的摄像头
Every piece of art is recorded from multiple angles.

1487
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:02,280
我们只是不需要在洗手间保护艺术品
We just don't happen to keep art in the bathroom.

1488
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,410
我不是批评家  凯尔
I'm not a critic, Kyle.

1489
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:06,580
我是保险调查员
I'm an insurance investigator.

1490
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,980
我不想那么做的
I didn't wanna do it.

1491
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,920
但是埃里克一直在撺掇我
But Eric's all, like, "Come on!"

1492
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,990
我表示我不想再这么做了
I'm, like, "Dude, I don't do that anymore."

1493
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:14,520
他说人人都这么做
He's, like, "Everyone's out on the loading dock!"

1494
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,590
我知道我很愚蠢
I know it was really stupid.

1495
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:19,230
我知道我是个混蛋
I know I'm an asshole,

1496
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:20,700
可那大麻都不是我的
but it wasn't even my weed.

1497
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:24,070
抱歉  你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

1498
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:25,700
那大麻不是我的  你想要我
It wasn't my weed! Do you want me

1499
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,370
尿在杯子里或是怎么样吗
to pee in a cup or something?

1500
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:28,700
不  不必了
No, that won't be necessary.

1501
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:29,970
你确定吗  我没关系的
Are you sure? I really don't mind.

1502
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:30,840
我很肯定
I'm positive.

1503
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,570
他们给我戴上了项链
They put the necklace on me.

1504
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,610
然后我走了红毯
Then I walked the red carpet.

1505
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:36,310
然后我看了展
Then I saw the exhibit.

1506
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:38,250
然后我喝了汤
Then I ate my soup.

1507
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,620
然后我吐得肠子都要出来了
Then I hurled my guts out.

1508
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:40,850
然后项链就丢了
Then the necklace was gone.

1509
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,650
然后大家就都抓狂了
And then everybody freaked out.

1510
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:45,750
然后他们又找回了项链  我以为
And then they found it again, I thought.

1511
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,550
结果不是吗
But, no?

1512
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,490
这位先生
This gentleman.

1513
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:51,060
克劳德·贝克
Claude Becker.

1514
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,560
他是我的男伴
He was my date.

1515
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,830
你戴着项链期间
Was there ever a time you two were alone

1516
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:58,800
有没有跟他独处过
while you were wearing the necklace?

1517
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,580
没有
No.

1518
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,550
你在洗手间的时候有人跟你在一起吗
Anyone present with you in the bathroom?

1519
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,950
我头埋在马桶里呢
My head was in a toilet bowl.

1520
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,210
那之后呢
How 'bout after?

1521
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,220
很多人
A lot of people.

1522
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:16,820
你认识这个女人吗
Do you know this woman?

1523
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:20,790
不认识
No.

1524
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:22,220
黛比·奥申  重罪犯
Debbie Ocean, convicted felon.

1525
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,590
她的哥哥  丹尼·奥申
Her brother, Danny Ocean,

1526
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:24,990
犯过更多重罪
more convicted felon.

1527
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,730
事情发生当晚她在场
She was present on the night of the incident.

1528
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:29,230
是她偷了项链吗
Did she steal the necklace?

1529
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:31,630
显然不是  她是唯一一个有不在场证明的
Apparently not, she's the only one with an alibi.

1530
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:34,130
全程对着摄像头微笑
Smiling at the camera the entire time.

1531
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,100
所以...
Ooh. So...

1532
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:39,580
所以我现在手头有五个履历清白的人有嫌疑
So I have five innocent people who seem to be suspects,

1533
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:42,080
而某个最有可能是嫌犯的人  却不是嫌犯
and someone who should be a suspect but isn't.

1534
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:44,550
我手头的摄像头
I have cameras

1535
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:46,820
覆盖了博物馆的每个角落
covering every inch of the museum,

1536
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,920
除了洗手间
except for the loo,

1537
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:54,020
而价值1.5亿的项链就在那里  在你的脖子上被偷了
where $150 million was stolen from that neck, your neck.

1538
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,520
有意思的案件
Interesting case.

1539
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:58,190
有时候我真爱我的工作
Some days, I love my job.

1540
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:01,100
我也爱我的工作
I love my job, too.

1541
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,020
你们完蛋了
You guys are fucked.

1542
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,790
地方不错
Nice place.

1543
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:31,990
这么大要开暖气可够费劲的
It must be a bitch to heat.

1544
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,790
打扰一下  你这是私闯民宅
Excuse me! You are trespassing.

1545
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,900
不  是我们邀请她来的
No. We asked her to come.

1546
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,570
你们邀请她来的
You asked her to come?

1547
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:42,070
几天前我们发现克卢格小姐...
We realized a few days ago that Miss Kluger...

1548
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:44,000
不是个货真价实的蠢货
Was not a total fricking idiot.

1549
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:46,980
她好像感觉到了我们要做什么
Might have gotten a sense of what we were doing.

1550
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,480
你的脖子是世界上最好看的
You've got one of the greatest necks in the world.

1551
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,820
首先  有一件事我很看得出来
First of all, if there's one thing I know,

1552
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,550
糟糕的演技
it's bad acting.

1553
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:59,220
事实上  你的脖子是唯一
In fact, you've got the only neck

1554
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,990
配得上这条项链的
that could carry this necklace off.

1555
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,790
而且我几乎从来不会吐
And I almost never throw up.

1556
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:06,360
就算我喝得很醉
Even when I'm really wasted.

1557
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,830
在水里
It was in the water.

1558
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:09,030
肯定是你跑的时候掉到水里了
It must have fallen off while you were running.

1559
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:14,500
最后  重要的是
And last but not least,

1560
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,300
我见过的人永远不会忘
I never forget a face.

1561
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:17,670
黛比·奥申
Debbie Ocean.

1562
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,080
好吧  所以
Yeah. Yeah. So,

1563
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,980
我觉得  8个人分1.5亿
seems to me, eight shares of 150 million

1564
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:28,050
总比7个人什么都分不到要好  对吧
is better than seven shares of nothing, right?

1565
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,690
怎么对我这么冷淡
Chilly!

1566
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:32,190
你好  达芙妮  欢迎加入我们
Hi, Daph! Welcome to the team!

1567
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:33,720
没必要击掌庆贺
Let's not all highfive at once.

1568
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,160
再说了  我可是把你们从保险诈骗罪中
Plus, I am the one who is saving your asses

1569
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,890
拯救出来了  什么
from insurance fraud.  What?

1570
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:39,960
保险诈骗罪  我刚要说到这个
Insurance fraud?  I was gonna get to that.

1571
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,400
什么时候的事
When?

1572
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,330
他们似乎派出了一名保险调查员
It seems that they've assigned an insurance investigator...

1573
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:45,630
他会把你们里里外外查个遍
Who's about to look up your ass with a flashlight.

1574
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,670
谁  神探科伦坡转世
Who?  This little Columbo dude,

1575
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:48,770
一模一样  除了不穿风衣
everything but the trench coat.

1576
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:49,870
绝对会查到你头上
Totally on to you.

1577
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,810
他叫约翰·弗雷泽
His name is John Frazier.

1578
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,170
你认识他  对
You know him?  Yes.

1579
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,840
他抓了我爸爸两次  我哥哥一次
He busted my father twice and my brother once.

1580
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:55,980
老熟人了
He's family.

1581
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,480
好了  以防大家忘记
All right. Lest we forget,

1582
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,980
这个计划说好了我不会坐牢的
this entire enterprise was to keep me out of jail.

1583
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,380
没人会坐牢的
Hey. No one's going to jail.

1584
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,380
你确定吗  我们料到了这种情况
Are you sure?  We expected this.

1585
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:04,620
早就做了准备
We prepared for this.

1586
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,590
对  很显然
Yup, that's clear.

1587
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:09,490
我们不会是首要嫌犯
We will not be the prime suspect.

1588
01:29:09,490 --> 01:29:11,390
好吧  那首要嫌犯是谁
Okay, well then who will be the prime suspect?

1589
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:13,700
有不少  有安保人员
There's a few. We've got the security guys,

1590
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,000
有侍者
we've got the busboys...

1591
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
还有害了你的阴险小人
The shady guy who put you away.

1592
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,340
男伴
The boyfriend.

1593
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,240
没错  他们要找偷项链的人
Yup. They were gonna be looking for somebody.

1594
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,880
我们只要确保不找上我们
Just had to make sure it wasn't one of us.

1595
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:31,280
设计得不错
It's nice.

1596
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,080
谢了
Thanks.

1597
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,420
太厉害了  计划得如此精确
That is amazing! The precision...

1598
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,690
对吧
Right?

1599
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:37,650
专注于细节
It's always the attention to detail

1600
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:38,920
就如同一首乐曲动听与否
and the little grace notes

1601
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,760
关键都在几个小小的装饰音上
that really make something sing.

1602
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:44,730
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

1603
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,670
我没几个闺蜜
I don't have that many close female friendships.

1604
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:53,270
读书俱乐部太烂了
And book clubs are the worst.

1605
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:55,400
我只是觉得
So I just thought

1606
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,070
在这里可以分享点乐趣
this could be something fun to share.

1607
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:59,040
你是因为孤独才来当罪犯吗
You're becoming a criminal because you're lonely?

1608
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:02,780
谁没有个这样的时候呢  对吧
Who isn't sometimes, right?

1609
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:04,210
你是独生女吗
Are you an only child?

1610
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,620
迈阿密的《仲夏夜之梦》怎么样
Midsummer Night's Dream in Miami?

1611
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,380
那是莎士比亚的剧
It's Shakespeare.

1612
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:13,450
她在威廉斯敦演过一些夏令剧目
She did summer stock at Williamstown,

1613
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:14,820
还演过一堆非百老汇的剧
plus a bunch of offBroadway.

1614
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,120
这个怎么样  她看起来不错
What about this one? She looks good.

1615
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:18,120
我看看  地方剧院
Let's see. Regional theater,

1616
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:19,890
但她在茱莉亚音乐学院接受过培训
but she trained at Juilliard.

1617
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,000
非常杰出的藏品
It's really a magnificent piece.

1618
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,060
这是你母亲的吗
This was your mother's?

1619
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:24,630
她过世后留给我的
Left to me after her passing.

1620
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,170
一个瑞典王子用这个
A Swedish prince gave it to her

1621
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:30,400
换了她的初夜
in exchange for her deflowering.

1622
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:31,970
有价值吗
Are they worth something?

1623
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:34,040
价值连城
Yes, they're worth quite a lot.

1624
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,410
"拿着"  我妈妈说  "走吧"
"Take these," My mother said. "Now, go."

1625
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:38,750
那晚在月光下
It was moonlight,

1626
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,180
他说
and then he said,

1627
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:44,460
"我要把星星全摘来给你"
"I'd give you every star in that sky."

1628
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:47,550
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1629
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,360
你一定很不好受
It must be difficult for you.

1630
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,860
克劳德·贝克  是我
Claude Becker?  Yeah.

1631
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:56,030
我是约翰·弗雷泽  你好
John Frazier.  Hi.

1632
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:58,270
我是SPD保险公司的  你好
SPD Insurance. How are you?

1633
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,170
克劳德
So, Claude...

1634
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,240
跟让·克劳德·范达姆[比利时动作巨星]的名字一样
Like JeanClaude Van Damme.

1635
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:05,970
对吧
Isn't it?

1636
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:07,140
有何贵干
What do you want?

1637
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:10,510
这是你和克卢格小姐
Here are some photographs of you

1638
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:11,950
一起的照片
with Miss Kluger.

1639
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:13,410
如你所见  很多照片里
Now, as you can see, there are many photographs

1640
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:16,080
你的手放在她的后颈上
where your hand is on the back of her neck.

1641
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:18,520
我不太记得我手放在哪里了
I don't really remember where my hands were.

1642
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,890
像你的作风
Ah. To be you.

1643
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:22,090
对吧
Right?

1644
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:24,890
问题在于
Problem is,

1645
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:26,230
项链被盗了
the necklace has been stolen

1646
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,100
一条赝品取代了它的位置
and a fake has been put in its place.

1647
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:29,230
眼下  最有机会
Right now, you're the person

1648
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:30,500
下手的人是你
with the greatest opportunity...

1649
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,730
我为什么要偷项链
Why would I wanna steal a necklace?

1650
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,770
我也一直在这么问自己
That's what I keep asking myself.

1651
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:37,310
这个男人
Why would this guy,

1652
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,140
他已经什么都有了
who's got everything,

1653
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,810
还有两个雕塑...
two of these...

1654
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:47,950
为什么他会想要偷一条项链
Why would that guy wanna steal a necklace?

1655
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,390
那你的答案是什么
What was your answer?

1656
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:54,920
也许他还有东西没有
Maybe he doesn't have everything.

1657
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:56,890
我觉得可以到此为止了
I think we're done here.

1658
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:58,260
只是一个猜想  真的
Just a theory.  Really.

1659
01:31:58,260 --> 01:31:59,590
瞎猜的  到此为止吧
A shot in the dark.  We're done.

1660
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,030
我很可能猜错了
I'm probably wrong.

1661
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:03,960
这是件出色的藏品  你可以拿下
It's a beautiful piece, and I want you to have it.

1662
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:06,370
价格不能再低了  能等一下吗
I can't go any lower. Just hold on one second.

1663
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:09,870
你好
Hello?

1664
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:13,670
你好
Hi.

1665
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,140
你在干什么
What're you doing right now?

1666
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:23,880
你好  约翰
Hello, John.

1667
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:25,190
你好  黛比
Hello, Debbie.

1668
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:27,020
你气色不错  我们多久没见了
You look well, how long's it been?

1669
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:30,020
好几年了  表现良好减刑了
A few years. Minus good behavior.

1670
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:31,590
这样啊  对
Right.  Yeah.

1671
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:33,900
谢谢你联系我  我正要打给你
Thank you for calling. I was gonna call you.

1672
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,930
不是我干的  当然不是
Yeah, I didn't do it.  Of course not.

1673
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:37,460
珠宝被盗时
You were just on camera 20 feet away

1674
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:38,800
你就在摄像头旁边
while the jewels were being nicked.

1675
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,070
纯属巧合
It's a coincidence.

1676
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:41,970
不  那是有力的不在场证明
No. That's a solid alibi.

1677
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:43,340
怎么回事  是你们家骨子里的基因吗
What is it? Is it genetic?

1678
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,040
你们全家都这样吗
Are the whole family like this?

1679
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,240
除了我的艾达阿姨
Except for my aunt Ida.

1680
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,380
她是图书馆员吗  家庭主妇
Librarian?  Mmm. Homemaker.

1681
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,810
好了  我就不为难你了
Right, I'm gonna make this easy for you.

1682
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:51,480
我不想抓你
I don't want you.

1683
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,320
我只想拿回项链
I just want the necklace.

1684
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,050
不管怎么拿回来的  我就说我在出租车上捡的
I don't care. I'll say I found it in a cab.

1685
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:57,590
要是只拿回一部分呢
How about some of it?

1686
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:03,120
多少  假设说10%呢
How much?  Hypothetically, 10%.

1687
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:04,760
那假设的其余部分呢
And where's the hypothetical rest?

1688
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,630
我不知道  真的
Oh, I don't know. Literally.

1689
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:10,460
天啊  太费劲了
Oh, God. This is exhausting!

1690
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:14,370
他们要我过来的时候我就...
I mean, when they said come over, I was like... Ugh.

1691
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:16,440
有时差  生物钟调不过来
You know, with the jet lag, the time difference,

1692
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,340
这周末阿森纳要踢足总杯决赛
Arsenal in the Cup Final this weekend.

1693
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,640
结果我在这里  真的有意思
But now I'm here. It's bloody interesting.

1694
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,650
你看
Yeah?

1695
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,980
这么说你不止想捞钱  还想复仇
So it's not just profit, it's revenge.

1696
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:32,420
一石二鸟
It's a twofer.

1697
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:34,920
他陷害你  你陷害他  扯平了
He frames you, you frame him, scores are settled.

1698
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,260
我只是给你传信的
I'm just the courier.

1699
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:39,260
世界和平  完美
All is right with the world, it's brilliant.

1700
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,790
我只是想帮一把老朋友
Just trying to help out an old friend.

1701
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,100
你知道吗  总有一天你得放手
You know, one day, you are gonna have to let this go?

1702
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,140
总有一天我会的
And one day, I will.

1703
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,310
这么说吧  我们抛开争论
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

1704
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:53,910
如果我的确知道部分项链的下落
that I do know where there's a part of that necklace.

1705
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:56,610
你能弄到搜查令吗
Can you get a search warrant?

1706
01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:01,320
我需要合理依据
I'd need probable cause.

1707
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,550
我们也许正在着手了
Well, we may or may not be working on that right now.

1708
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:11,360
你想玩个游戏吗
Do you wanna play a game?

1709
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,460
什么游戏
What kind of game?

1710
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:18,000
打牌游戏
A card game.

1711
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,510
来吧  来吧
Yes, yes!

1712
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,580
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

1713
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:38,560
你要去哪
Where are you going?

1714
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:40,620
等一下
Wait.

1715
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:02,240
你在哪里
Where are you?

1716
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:04,480
我马上回来
I'll be right there.

1717
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:14,910
你不知道钻石为何会出现在你家里
You have no idea how this came to be in your possession?

1718
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,320
对
No.

1719
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:19,390
但项链被掉包的当晚
But you were Ms. Kluger's date

1720
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:21,860
你是克卢格小姐的男伴
the night these necklaces were switched.

1721
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,390
是的
Yes, I was.

1722
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:28,700
你不觉得那太过于巧合了吗
Does that strike you as a rather large coincidence?

1723
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,340
包括一粒33.18克拉  内部完美无瑕的D级钻石...
Including a 33.18, D color, internally flawless diamond...

1724
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:36,070
亚德利拍卖行年度宝石拍卖会

1725
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:38,000
你听过一个叫做
Are you familiar with a company called

1726
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:40,170
贝克控股的公司吗
Becker Holdings, LLC?

1727
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:41,540
当然
Of course.

1728
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:44,610
最近有四位
Well, it seems four sweet old ladies,

1729
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:47,380
查无此人的女士
who apparently don't exist,

1730
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:50,880
向贝克控股公司
have recently transferred some very large sums of money

1731
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:53,760
转账了大笔资金
into Becker Holdings, LLC.

1732
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:59,160
你知道是怎么回事吗  贝克先生
Do you know how that might have happened, Mr. Becker?

1733
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:07,000
我要见我的律师
I think I need to talk to my lawyer.

1734
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,740
我想也是
I think you do.

1735
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:19,380
敬我们的好朋友卡尔  是克劳德
To our dear friend Carl...  Claude.

1736
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:24,150
克劳德·贝克  祝他在监狱里安息
Claude Becker. May he rest in peace in prison.

1737
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:25,420
干杯
Cheers.

1738
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,850
爱你  爱你  爱你
Love you, love you, love you.

1739
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:27,890
干杯  干杯
Cheers.  Cheers.

1740
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:30,230
我有个问题
I have a question.

1741
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:31,730
是这样的
So...

1742
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,490
还好是他去坐牢
It's good that he went to jail,

1743
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,560
而我们没有
'cause it's great that we didn't.

1744
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:40,330
但这些首饰只卖了8500万
But if you only sold the jewels for 85 million,

1745
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:42,510
那每个人要怎么才能分到1600万
how does it work out that we get 16 apiece?

1746
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:46,510
你来讲吧
Do you wanna?

1747
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:49,010
你以为我们只打算偷一条项链吗
You thought we were just gonna steal one necklace?

1748
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:52,610
你当我们是那么没出息吗
What do you think we are, a bunch of pussies?

1749
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:54,080
当时大家都急着找
See, while everyone was worried

1750
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:55,620
你脖子上不翼而飞的那条项链
about what was happening around your neck...

1751
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,620
而你正忙着把你的场子吐出来
And you were hurling your guts out...

1752
01:37:57,620 --> 01:37:58,820
话说回来  多谢了
Thanks for that, by the way.

1753
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,850
你表现很好
It was amazing.

1754
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:02,220
太厉害了
That was really impressive.

1755
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:03,520
真的很厉害
That was really nice, actually.

1756
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:06,660
晚会场地被封锁了
The place kinda went on lockdown.

1757
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:08,130
厨房也清空了
The kitchen was cleared out, too.

1758
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:10,900
当大家都守着门口的时候
And while everyone was watching the entrance,

1759
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,900
我们就去展会上看了看
we thought we'd check out the exhibit.

1760
01:38:15,010 --> 01:38:18,240
既然能够偷到更多
Because why would you just steal one necklace,

1761
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:23,610
为何只偷一条项链呢
when you could steal more?

1762
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,310
天哪  老天
Holy shit!  Holy shit!

1763
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:27,780
这可够多的
That's a lot.

1764
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,080
是吧
Yeah.

1765
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:31,950
我们不止打印了杜桑
We didn't just print the Toussaint from that thing.

1766
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:33,550
还打印了很多件珠宝
We printed a lot of jewels.

1767
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,490
感觉像是在金考快印工作
Felt like I was working at Kinko's.

1768
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:38,630
与此同时
Meanwhile,

1769
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:40,630
我决定去拜访一位老朋友
I decided to visit an old friend.

1770
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:42,630
你好吗

1771
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:52,670
亚马逊有卖这种6米长的自拍杆
Amazon sells these 20foot selfie sticks.

1772
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,680
他们只会看到一瞬间模糊了一下
All they saw was a quick, little blur.

1773
01:38:57,570 --> 01:38:58,240
可以吗

1774
01:38:58,570 --> 01:38:59,250
可以

1775
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,820
这是短期展览  他们还装了
It was a temporary exhibit and they built

1776
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:01,820
金属架来挂列衣服
this metal grid to hang the dresses from.

1777
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:03,490
一  二  三

1778
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:07,620
我们就决定让小严也挂上去
We just decided to suspend Yen from that as well.

1779
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:28,340
要是有人进来怎么办
What if somebody came in?

1780
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,880
的确有人进来了
Oh. Somebody did.

1781
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,350
抱歉  女士  你不能待在这儿
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't be here.

1782
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:33,820
我们正在清场
We're clearing this whole area.
活动组织太差了

1783
01:39:34,690 --> 01:39:36,780
场地里一点标牌都没有

1784
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:37,820
简直疯了

1785
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:38,740
疯了

1786
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:10,520
我丈夫没和其他宾客在楼下

1787
01:40:10,850 --> 01:40:13,310
他晚上脑子会很糊涂

1788
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:16,650
昨天他把鞋子放冰箱里了

1789
01:40:17,110 --> 01:40:18,610
他把鞋子放冰箱里了

1790
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,910
别碰我

1791
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:25,820
你们知道这裙子值多少钱吗

1792
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,200
别碰我

1793
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:34,410
处理好了
We're okay.

1794
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:11,750
偷项链很成功
Stealing the necklace was great,

1795
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,480
但要是少了声东击西
but without that diversion,

1796
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,910
要是没有清空展会现场
without clearing out the exhibit...

1797
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,180
我们就得不到这些宝贝
We wouldn't have been able to grab these.

1798
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:18,490
这些
These,

1799
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:23,760
能让每个人分得3830万
which bring your cuts to $38,300,000 each.

1800
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:48,520
对  太美了
Yeah, I know. It's so beautiful.

1801
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:03,130
亲爱的  我知道  但是你不能把口香糖
Sweetie, I know, but you can't put gum

1802
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:05,030
粘在你妹妹的头发上
in your sister's hair.

1803
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:07,870
我不管她有没有先粘你的鼻子
I don't care if she tried to put it in your nose first.

1804
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,650
看到了吗  是姐们我
What's up, YouTube? It's your girl!

1805
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:24,790
看看我的新窝
Check out my new crib.

1806
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:26,820
我还是业主委员会的呢
I'm on the coop board.

1807
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,160
卡  喊卡了
Cut!  That's a cut!

1808
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,670
卡  卡  卡  喊卡了
Cut, cut, cut!  That's a cut!

1809
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,000
重拍一条
Resetting back to one.

1810
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,930
镜头过来要再流畅一点
Uh, just, you know... Smoother.

1811
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:42,540
请让一下  演得很好
Just a little bit of space, please. It was perfect.

1812
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:44,140
情绪再快一点  再痛苦一点
I just need it faster and more damaged.

1813
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,770
懂了吗  很好
All right? Great.

1814
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:47,580
演戏有那么难吗
It's not that hard!

1815
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:06,990
你在的话  会喜欢我的点子的
You would've loved it.
