Shao Dre.
你没有仔细看清楚 小德瑞

932
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:31,001

- 你看到什么
- 自己

933
01:16:27,841 --> 01:16:32,004

在这里和这里

939
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:51,272
{\1c&H4080FF&}所以 蛇反映她动静 有如静止的水一般

940
01:16:45,886 --> 01:16:51,906
{\1c&H4080FF&}So, the snake reflects her action,
like still water.

941
01:16:51,909 --> 01:16:54,519
{\1c&H4080FF&}- Like a mirror?

are two very different things.
静止和什么都不做是完全不同的

you need to learn how to control.

- Cobra takes a lifetime.
我只想学那个蛇功

952
01:17:37,705 --> 01:17:40,457

953
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:44,144
{\1c&H4080FF&}- Requires great focus.
- But I have great focus?!
需要专心致志

954
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:46,373

crossing the street.
德瑞 过马路时小心点

962
