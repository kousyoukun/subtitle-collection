00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,666
We was in the kitchen
washing dishes together,

154
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,625
but I worked with the motherfucker.

155
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:57,125
One day, he went up in front of
the right promoter, got his big break.

156
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,375
Oh, here go that fucking Ricco.

157
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,083
Ah, man, he smells like urine.
He be touching the door.

158
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,791
- Man, go stop him.
- I'm not stopping shit, man.

159
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,750
I'm assistant manager.
I'm delegating to you.

160
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,291
You deal with stinking-ass Ricco.

161
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,041
I'm not going
anywhere near them germs, man.

162
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,916
Ricco responds best to authority,
so the manager should do it.

163
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,750
Oh, shit, man.

164
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,416
Hell, no, Ricco. Not today.

165
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,125
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives.

166
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,750
Been shot in the ass by two Colt .45s.

167
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,750
I know, I know.

168
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,583
Been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel.

169
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:37,166
I chew up railroad iron,
and I shit out steel.

170
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,875
All right, nigga, let's go. That's it.

171
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,708
Jumped in the ocean
and swallowed a whale.

172
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,708
Handcuffed lightning,
throwed thunder's ass in jail.

173
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,375
[Rudy] Look, Ricco, this ain't no place
for your hobo stories.

174
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,250
Whoa, I ain't no hobo.

175
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,750
I am a repository
of Afro-American folklore.

176
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,916
Come on. Lookit, brother. I just need
some money to get something to eat.

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,375
I ain't got no teeth.
All I can do is sip on some soup.

178
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,833
Come on, give me a quarter.

179
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,375
Ricco, I'm gonna give you a quarter.
You go get you some soup.

180
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,041
Then you just got to get up out of here.
Let's go, man.

181
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,166
- Get my black ass on.
- Go on now. All right, okay.

182
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,500
First, I'm gonna tell you one of the
funniest fuckin' things you ever did hear.

183
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,625
- Oh, come on, man.
- Some people think that Willie Green...

184
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,916
was the baddest man
the world had ever seen.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But I want you to light up a joint,
screw your wig on tight,

186
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,416
and let me tell you about
a little bad motherfucker

187
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
called Dolemite.

188
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,500
[laughs]

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
[dings]

190
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,083
[man] Man, I haven't heard those
in a long time.

191
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,250
- Dolemite, Signifying Monkey.
- He did all of them ones.

192
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,666
'Cause I had a uncle that was in jail,

193
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,208
and they was doing that shit
all the time, telling jokes,

194
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,208
'cause they had nothing else to do.

195
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,041
You could fuck.

196
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,958
Yes, Toney, you could fuck,
but we ain't talking about that right now.

197
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,708
Hey, you know what I was thinking, man.

198
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,041
What y'all think would happen
if somebody took those jokes...

199
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,708
a professional, and polished them,
and turn it into a act?

200
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,291
Yeah, and did it on a stoop. [laughs]

201
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,541
- In a barbershop?
- Yeah, in a barbershop.

202
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,708
- Rudy, that's a good idea.
- Yeah, man, that shit could work.

203
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,041
Say, Rudy man, all them slave jokes,
that shit not gonna work.

204
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,041
I wouldn't put it in my act, personally.

205
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,684
- Hey, man, funny is funny.
<i>- </i>They're not ready for the big time.

206
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,416
I don't know what time it's gonna
make it to, but the shit is funny.

207
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,208
Look here. Them white folks gonna see
that country-ass nigga get up onstage

208
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,416
and say, "Now what in the fuck
is he about to say now?" [laughs]

209
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,708
Before I go out, I always keep
"The Morning After" in my hip pocket,

210
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,958
- just in case there's any white faces.
- What the hell is "The Morning After"?

211
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,208
Don't be ignant. The love theme
from <i>The Poseidon Adventure.</i>

212
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,166
<i>♪ There's got to be a morning after ♪</i>

213
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,083
<i>♪ If we can hold on through the night... ♪</i>

214
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,750
Oh, man, what in the fuck
you gonna learn that shit for?

215
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,750
You ain't gonna never play that
for whitey.

216
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,875
Last thing they wanna see

217
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,291
is your big black ass onstage
singing "The Morning After."

218
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,416
And I know you ain't sitting here
criticizing nobody.

219
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,958
You stealing jokes
from hobos and bums arou...

220
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,333
[laughs]

221
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,458
[Ben] He got you there, Rudy.

222
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,333
Hey, you know what?

223
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,208
Fuck you, niggas.
Fuck y'all know, anyway?

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,958
[laughs]

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Rudy.

226
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,791
Rudy.

227
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,666
Man, I'm sorry.
We was just havin' a little fun.

228
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,666
Hey, man, how'd my life get so damn small?

229
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,625
I came out here
with some big plans, Jimmy.

230
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,625
I was gonna do it all,
just like Sammy Davis Jr.

231
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,166
Movies, concerts, TV. Everything.

232
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,416
This job at Dolphin's supposed to be
my temporary day job.

233
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,000
Cut to a million years later,
it's all I got.

234
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:55,083
- You still got the Californian Club.
- Oh, man. That ain't gonna lead to shit.

235
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,375
I ain't got nothing nobody want.

236
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,416
[car door slams]

237
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,875
- [man] Man, he got somethin'.
- [second man] Yeah.

238
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,583
[second man] Man, who the... Who is this?

239
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,125
I don't know, man. You ever seen him?

240
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,017
- No, I ain't never seen any...
- Hey, brothers.

241
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,583
How y'all doing tonight?
I'm trying to find Ricco.

242
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,916
Ricco? Who in the fuck is that?

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,708
That's a old bum with no teeth.

244
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,791
- You mean like this?
- [both chuckle]

245
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,583
Oh, shit. Guess that
ain't narrow it down at all, did it?

246
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,250
It ain't like it used to be.

247
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,208
This neighborhood been went to shit, man.
It's sad, sad, sad.

248
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:36,666
You see this building over here?
That's the Dunbar Hotel.

249
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,666
That used to be the center
of black arts entertainment.

250
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,708
I saw Duke Ellington there,
Billie Holiday,

251
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:48,083
but now it's just filled with
a bunch of junkies and winos.

252
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,166
- Junkies and winos.
- Tony, I'm gonna pay your money. Shit.

253
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,958
[Rudy] Oh, shit. There he go right there.

254
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,625
- Ricco. Hey, man.
- [man] That what you been talking about?

255
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,583
Hey, brother! How you doing, Ricco?

256
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,500
- What's going on, man?
- I don't know you.

257
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,125
Yeah, man. I'm your friend
from Dolphin's Records.

258
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,916
Ain't you the son of a bitch
that throws me out?

259
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,208
Oh, no, Ricco. That's that other guy, man.

260
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,208
Hey, man, look. Look here, man.
I got some money, and I got some hooch.

261
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,458
How you like to sit down
and tell me your stories?

262
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,625
[Ricco] Cocaine Shorty's my name.
Fuckin' is my claim.

263
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:21,291
You can line 98 hos up against a wall,
I bet you a dollar I can fuck 'em all.

264
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,291
- I can top that.
- [man] Oh, no, you can't top that.

265
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,583
Hey, neither can he.

266
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,208
- I'm the funniest motherfucker out here.
- [man] Hey, don't need to argue, fellas.

267
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,166
Hold on now. I got some more money.

268
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,166
I wanna hear
from all the liquor store wise men.

269
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,750
Okay, let's go now. What's next?

270
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,125
[man] <i>I fucked an elephant and her mother.</i>

271
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,208
I fucked the bull, the cow,
and her brother.

272
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,250
- [bums laughing]
- [tape stops]

273
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,333
I need a better punchline.

274
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,541
Fucked a... cow... bull, a cow.

275
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,375
Fucked a elephant.
Dared her to mutter.

276
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,791
I could look up a bull's ass
and tell you the price of butter.

277
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,583
[chuckles]

278
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,875
That is funny.

279
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,166
Fucked an elephant down to a coon.

280
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,750
Even fucked the same...
Yes, I fucked an elephant down to a coon.

281
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,750
I fucked a elephant down to a coon!

282
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,916
Yes, I fucked a elephant down to a coon.

283
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Even fucked the same cow
that jumped over the motherfucking moon.

284
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,000
[Ricco] <i>I got kicked out of South America
for fucking steers.</i>

285
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,541
I fucked a she elephant
till she broke down in tears.

286
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,250
I got thrown out of South America
for fucking steers.

287
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,666
I fucked King Kong's mama
till she broke down in tears.

288
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,708
Dole-Dolemite is my...

289
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,791
Dolemite is my name.

290

a lion stepped on
a signified monkey's feet!

294
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,958
Dolemite is my name,
and fucking up motherfuckers is my game!

295
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,000
- [jazz music playing]
- [man] All right.

296
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,208
How it is that he can take you
beautiful people with him?

297
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,333
[woman] That's my kinfolk. Come on now.

298
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,708
Stay right here. [laughs] Yes, sir.

299
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,755
The fuck is you in tux? What'd you do
to your hair? You look like a pimp.

300
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,208
I come up with a new character
and all new material, too.

301
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,291
Well, actually, it's old material.

302
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,708
I don't need this.

303
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,916
Just stick to your regular set.

304
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,166
It's always somethin'.

305
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,666
[overlapping chatter]

306
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,708
Way down in the jungle deep...

307
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,750
the lion stepped on
the signified monkey's feet.

308
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,541
The monkey said,
"Motherfucker, can't you see...

309
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,000
you standing on my goddamn feet?"

310
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,500
[faint chuckling]

311
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,125
The lion said,
"I ain't heard a word you said.

312
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,541
If you say three more, I'll jump off
on your motherfucking head."

313
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,000
- [laughter]
- [drum sting]

314
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,958
Man, don't give me
that Buddy Hackett shit.

315
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,208
Make that shit swing.
Put your weight on it.

316
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,041
- [plays percussive rhythm]
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

317
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,125
But the monkey got wise
and started using his wit.

318
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,666
Said, "I think I'm gonna bring an end
to all this ass-kicking shit."

319
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,166
[laughter]

320
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,666
He ran up on the lion the very next day.

321
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,416
He said, "Oh, Mr. Lion,

322
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,833
there's a big, bad, burly motherfucker
coming your way."

323
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,166
He said, "And he's somebody
that you don't know...

324
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,750
'cause he just broke-a loose
from Ringling Brothers' show."

325
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,583
Said, "He talked about your people
in a hell of a way.

326
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,166
Yes, he talked about your people
till my hair turned gray."

327
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,250
[laughter]

328
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,875
He said, "Your daddy's a freak,
and your mama's a whore."

329
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,416
Said, "He spotted you in the jungle
sellin' your black ass from door to door."

330
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,750
- [murmuring]
- [applauding]

331
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,041
He said, "Your sister got down
and did a hell of a trick.

332
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,000
She got so low,
she sucked a earthworm's dick."

333
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,750
He said he corn-holed your uncle,
fucked your auntie and your niece,

334
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,708
and the next time he see your grandma,
he gonna get him another good piece.

335
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,125
[raucous laughter]

336
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,625
I ain't lying!

337
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,958
- Smells good.
- [woman chuckles]

338
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,166
- [woman] Just like back home, right?
- Yes, Lord.

339
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,875
Say, when's the last time
you been back to Arkansas?

340
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,750
Oh, a long time. I ain't got
a lot of good memories from back home,

341
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,208
so I don't be thinking about
back home much.

342
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,958
Basically, when I think about back home,
I think, "Fuck back home."

343
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,291
Hey, you know, Auntie?

344
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,375
Mm-hmm?

345
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,708
You know, I was thinking about
maybe putting out another record.

346
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,125
Another record? Why don't you help me
get rid of some of that shit

347
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,708
that's stacked up over there
in the corner? "Another record."

348
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,875
This time, I'm gonna put out
a comedy record.

349
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:40,291
Comedy? You've been a singer,
you've been a shake dancer,

350
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,250
and one time, I think
you even called yourself a fortune teller.

351
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,750
You know it's real hard to break in.
I'd do whatever it takes to get in.

352
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,791
Is it gonna be like that
cute lil' Bill Cosby?

353
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,833
He's so sweet.

354
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:57,750
He tells those family tales
about the kids playing in the street,

355
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,791
playing jacks and such. I like that.

356
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,958
Yeah, there's gonna be stories
about family and kids

357
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,291
- and a grandma and grandpa.
- Oh, that's nice.

358
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,750
So, yeah, it's gonna be stories,
but listen. Here's what the thing is.

359
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,708
- I'm trying to be entrepreneurial on this.
- Oh, let us bow our heads and pray.

360
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,041
Father God, I wanna thank you
for giving me the strength

361
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,250
to make this meal for my beloved family.

362
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:21,416
Let us nourish our body
in Jesus' name. Amen.

363
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,916
- Thank you, Lord.
- All right, then.

364
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,375
Thank you for this pork chop.
Now, as I was saying...

365
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,578
- You want some hot sauce?
- Come on now, Auntie, now.

366
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,166
I wanna be entrepreneurial on this thing,
and I need you to loan me some money

367
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,375
- so I can get some recording equipment.
- No, no.

368
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,708
- Mm-mmm.
- Come on, Auntie. You rich, woman.

369
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,625
I'm not rich.
What make you think I'm rich?

370
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,416
What happened to all that money you made
when you fell off that bus?

371
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,833
Uh, that is my money
to do with what I want to,

372
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,833
and I only got $250.

373
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,958
That's exactly how much I need
to be a star.

374
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,500
- Come on, woman. Loan me...
- I got my coat on layaway...

375
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,250
- Please...
- I'm already into 'em for $50...

376
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,666
She gonna give me the money.

377
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,083
'Cause you about to cut off my air supply.
Get up from around my neck.

378
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,041
- Why you so fucking stingy, then?
- Ain't this a bitch?

379
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,750
- Give me the money, woman.
- [sighs]

380
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,625
Why the hell is there a line?
You told me we were going to a party.

381
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,916
We are going to a party.
We're making a party record.

382
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,333
Come on in. Come on in. Watch your step.

383
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,166
- Watch your step.
- Gimme some skin, baby.

384
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,041
Come on in. Watch your step.

385
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,958
Fedco gin?
I didn't even know they made alcohol.

386
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,000
Nigga, we ain't going for flavor.

387
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,166
Look, I don't see how this can work.
We should be in a real club.

388
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,041
I don't wanna hear that shit.
We got what we got. Gotta make it work.

389
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,291
- You're my producer, right?
- I am?

390
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,750
What do you think we're doing here?
We producing an album.

391
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,083
- Okay.
- Okay, all right? Come here, man.

392
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,166
Okay.

393
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,000
Hey, man,
get these people limber and loose.

394
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,125
Right, right, right, right.
[breathes deeply]

395
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,708
Producer.

396
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,250
Oh, guess I'm producing.

397
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,750
All right, y'all know what it is.
Y'all know what time it is.

398
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,666
It's show time, y'all. Come on now.

399
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,000
Give yourself a round of applause.

400
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,208
Okay, I want everybody
to have a good time tonight.

401
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,750
We doing a album this evening,
a live recording.

402
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,375
We got a engineer back there.
He's professional.

403
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,375
That nigga done been on <i>Leave It to Beaver</i>
and <i>Gunsmoke.</i> All kinds of shit.

404
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,791
Okay. Yeah, all right, y'all.
The time we've been waiting for.

405
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,791
The man of the hour. The man, the myth.

406
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,583
You love him, and I love him.

407

Put your hands together
for Rudy Ray Moore.

[woman] All right now.

411
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,125
Some folks say Willie Green...

412
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:07,083
was the baddest motherfucker
that the world had ever seen.

413
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,208
I want you to light you up a joint,
take a real good shit,

414
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,541
and screw your wig on tight.

415
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:18,041
And let me tell you about that
bad motherfucker called Dolemite.

416
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,708
Dolemite. Come on, Rudy.

417
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,958
[Rudy on tape]
<i>Now, Dolemite was born in San Antone.</i>

418
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,666
<i>A rambling, gambling,
scrambling motherfucker</i>

419
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,041

<i>On the day he was dropped
from his mammy's ass...</i>

421
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,458
<i>he slapped his pappy in the face,
and said,</i>

422
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,083
<i>"From now on, cocksucker,
I'm running this place."</i>

423

- Okay, I've heard enough.

424

- Hey, but you haven't even got to the...
- It's filthy. And I know filthy.

425
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,250
Jesus, you can't play that over the radio.

426
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,416
And you can't sell it over the counter
in most cities.

427
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,666
Record stores, they don't wanna be raided.

428
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,625
Raided? Hey, come on, man.
The world has changed.

429
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:01,458
<i>Deep Throat</i> is a big-ass hit movie,
and the lady sucks a cock in every scene.

430
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,416
Yeah, in porno houses.

431
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,208
Record stores, they're a family business.

432
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,541
Kids go in.

433
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:13,416
Uh, look, on vinyl,
you can call a guy a cocksucker,

434
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,875
but you can't say he sucks a cock.

435
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,958
- Can you grasp the distinction?
- No, I do not.

436
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,041
If I want to say
that a woman's pussy is so hot,

437
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,583
it makes a motherfucker's asshole burn,
then I'm gonna say it!

438
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,625
Then say it.

439
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:35,416
But you've got a product here
that you can't sell or promote.

- [door slams]
- What'd he say?

442
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:45,250
Shit, man, we just got into some legal
semantic argument about cocksucking.

443
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:53,416
You know what, man? Fuck him.
We gonna put this shit out ourself.

444
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:55,833
Come on.

hit the <i>Billboard </i>charts at the same time.

747
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,500
That's why I feel it's time for me
to make my move to the big screen.

748
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,041
Right. If I could just
shoot straight with you?

749
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:08,500
When we say gigantic fan base,
aren't we really just talking about

750
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:11,063
a small group of passionate
brothers and sisters here or there?

751
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,041
I mean, your appeal is limited.

752
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,291
It's not exactly
like you're playing the Apollo.

753
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,541
Now, surely you wouldn't suggest
for American International

754
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:25,083
to invest the likes of $300,000
to turn this into a major production.

755
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,458
Yeah, but come on, man.
I see all y'all's posters here.

756
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:28,708
I fit in perfect.

757
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,041
Black folks love me.

758
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,791
Yeah, you see,
that's the thing here, Rudy.

759
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,875
Here, we do
a certain type of black picture.

760
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:41,166
The actors we hire
are like, uh, Fred Williamson, Jim Brown.

761
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:46,500
Now, see, you on the other hand,
you're a bit doughier than them, you see?

762
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,250
Doughier?

763
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:55,458
Well, hey, man, I put on a girdle.
What I got to do?

764
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:58,375
Come on, brother.
They waiting on Dolemite movie.

765
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,083
Let's bring Dolemite to the screen.

766
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,875
I don't know how much longer
we can do these pictures, Rudy.

767
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:05,125
You see,
that's why we changing our approach.

768
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,250
We got a new one coming.
I bet you gonna like this.

769
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,958
You really gonna dig this one.

770
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:14,041
Check this out.
It's called <i>Cornbread, Earl and Me.</i>

771
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,500
It's about a kid from the ghetto

772
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:18,463
that's the first from the neighborhood
to get out and make it to college.

773
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,333
Now, don't that make you feel good
on the inside, Rudy?

774
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:27,166
Brother, don't nobody wanna see
no shit like that.

775
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:31,041
Come on, Rudy.
Be realistic.

776
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:34,541
You're not a movie star.
You're not an actor.

777
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,500
You're not Billy Dee Williams.

778
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:39,333
You're a comedy star. Be happy with that.

779
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:42,625
Man, I want more. All my life,
people been telling me no.

780
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:45,208
My daddy always told me
I was a piece of shit.

781
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:48,250
Just another dumb-ass country-poor nigga.

782
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,500
Thought I was gonna be a sharecropper
like he was.

783
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:53,250
[chuckles] I can't imagine you
plowing fields.

784
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,750
He wasn't my real daddy nohow.

785
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,833
Dirty rotten motherfucker
always beating on me.

786
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:02,333
That's why I left home when I was 15,
go and make something of myself.

787
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,208
Look, man. We all had shitty childhoods,

788
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,958
but that don't mean you can just
will yourself into being a movie star.

789
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:11,875
Well, why not, Toney? Shit,
I willed myself into being a comedian.

790
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:13,666
I willed myself into being a singer.

791
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,250
I even made my own album
in my goddamn living room.

792
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,041
How come I can't be in the movies?

793
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,416
I want the world to know I exist.

794
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,791
[whistle blows]

795
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,875
[funk music plays]

796
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,916
How much money you planning on
spending on this thing?

797
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,125
Well, I figure, you know, with money
I got from my records, and...

798
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,166
I go ask the label for some money,
I probably get about $70,000.

799
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,541
That's good, Rudy.

800
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:44,041
Well, hey, Rudy, how much money
you gonna pay Jimmy

801
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,416
- for doing his shit since you know him?
- We ain't discussed that stuff yet.

802
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,666
But you know my man
don't work for free, right?

803
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,309
- You gon' fuck my money up.
- You know you're not working for free?

804
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,333
Is that really enough to pay
for all the people you gonna need?

805
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,616
At the movies, I always sit through
the closing credits,

806
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:01,458
and that's a lot of folk.
Key grip, best boy.

807
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:04,083
- Wish I had me a best boy.
- [Reed] Okay, honey.

808
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,833
Oh, damn, Toney, don't nobody
wanna hear all that shit, man.

809
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:08,833
We having a pleasant barbecue.

810
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:12,416
And besides, ain't nobody gonna be
getting called "boy" on my set.

811
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,333
Hey, look now.
If we gonna do this shit,

812
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:17,708
we gonna all have to chip in together
and help out.

813
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,666
Now, Toney, your receipts
always add up to the penny, man,

814
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,791
so you gonna be in charge of the money.

815
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:25,333
Jimmy, your act got all them
great props and costumes,

816
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,083
so you gonna do all that shit.

817
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:31,166
And, Ben, you write the funkiest songs,
so will you please do the music?

818
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,791
But, um, who gonna write this movie, Rudy?

819
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:39,416
'Cause at the Oscars, they always say,
"It starts with the word."

820
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,166
So who gonna write that word, Rudy?

821
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,458
My baby!

822
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,166
The needle took my baby!

823
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:52,500
Sweet Jesus, when will this stop?

824
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,208
I'm gonna kill that pusher.

825
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,583
- I'm gonna make him pay!
- No!

826
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,208
More death won't solve our problems!

827
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:01,666
Well, then what will, Mom?

828
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:05,500
[woman]
I am not about to lose another son.

829
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,250
What, you gonnna sit here and pray?
And cry?

830
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,458
That's what made him turn to that junk
in the first place.

831
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,166
Keeping it inside.

832
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:19,916
It wasn't about the text,
it was about the emotions.

833
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,625
Hey, sister. Sorry to bother you.
You is a bad motherfucker.

834
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:24,500
What you did tonight, I really enjoyed it.

835
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:26,750
- Oh, thank you.
- Some of the best acting I seen.

836
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:29,059
I'm trying to find Jerry
that wrote the play. Where's he?

837
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,123
Uh, right here. I'm Jerry.

838
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:32,875
Hey, man! How you doing, brother?
Good to meet you.

839
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,559
Yeah, I called you just recently,
and I sent you some of my albums.

840
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:38,625
- I'm Rudy Ray Moore.
- Yes. Oh, yes, yes. A pleasure, Mr. Moore.

841
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:42,083
Yeah, man. Look, I ain't even know about
this theater. It's mighty fine, though.

842
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:44,333
A lot of talented brothers
and sisters wanna act,

843
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,096
but nobody's hiring them,
know what I mean?

844
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,375
No TV, no movies. So this is where
they come to show off their craft.

845
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,916
That's beautiful, man.

846
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,625
So, regarding your albums.

847
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,291
- Right.
- I gotta be honest. I listened to them.

848
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,875
They're not really my bag.

849
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,875
Oh, well, brother,
you ain't got to be funny.

850
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,916
All I want you to do is write a story
for me, all the things that happen.

851
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,840
The good guys and the bad guys,
the cops and robbers. Them kinda things.

852
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:09,500
- I'm gonna supply all the comedy.
- Oh...

853
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:15,416
I can be humorous. But my work
has to inform as well as entertain.

854
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,166
For example, my next play
is called <i>The Devil's Cotton Field.</i>

855
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:22,666
It's a piece of black history
set in the country town I grew up in.

856
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,166
It's called Varner, Arkansas.

857
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,916
Varner. You from Varner?
Shit, I'm from Fort Smith, nigga.

858
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,101
- All right, we got something in common.
- What, that we're both from Arkansas?

859
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,708
That we both knew to get our black asses
out of Arkansas.

860
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,851
Ain't nothing but canned mutton
in that motherfucker.

861
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,000
You got that right.

862
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:41,625
Rudy, I admire your tenacity,
but... I'm about my art.

863
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:44,583
I write my plays,
I teach at an acting school.

864
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:48,041
- I'm trying to uplift the community.
- Come on with all that bullshit, man.

865
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:51,750
We both left Arkansas for L.A.,
and we doing the same hustle now.

866
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,291
And I dig what you're doing here.

867
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,775
This is beautiful,
bringing the people together and all that.

868
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:59,250
That's what I aspire to do.
But I'm talking about something bigger.

869
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:03,333
I'm talking about the opportunity
to get your message to all the people

870
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:04,708
through movies.

871
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:08,416
Jerry Jones movies.

872
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:14,833
We want this thing to be raw.
Tell it like it is on the streets.

873
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,625
Yeah, lots of pimps and whores
and cussing and all that shit.

874
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:21,416
And kung fu, karate.
Brothers love all that kung fu.

875
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,291
Gotta have all the kung fu and karate
and that Bruce Lee shit. They love that.

876
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,583
I'm sorry, do... do you know karate?

877
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:30,750
No, but I'm a fast learner.
I can learn how to chop me a motherfucker!

878
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:32,750
[karate yells]

879
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,750
You know what we should have?

880
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,000
A all-girl kung-fu army.

881
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,000
- Um, you know, there's...
- [kettle blows]

882
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:43,750
...there's plenty
of story opportunity, Rudy.

883
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:47,666
Across this nation, inner cities
are bein' plagued by violent crime.

884
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:52,041
- I feel the government hasn't stepped up...
- That's it. It's whitey's fault.

885
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,291
It's a corrupt government. They corrupt.

886
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,015
The motherfucker don't care about
the people. The mayor is corrupt.

887
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,083
He one of them Nixon motherfuckers.
And there's a exorcism.

888
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,958
- Goddamn it, an exorcism?
- Yeah, you know, all that...

889
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,791
[growling]
"Your mother sucks cocks in hell."

890
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,333
They love that shit.
That's they favorite dish right now.

891
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:12,958
Okay. Um, I don't know how that

but the truth is, ain't nobody
been on a movie set before,

1058
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,250
so we don't know all that technical stuff
like lights and sound and camera.

01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:07,125
And in the meantime,
I tried to amuse myself,

1340
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:10,625
so I'd just pretend that he was fuckin'
some mangy-ass donkey we had,

1341
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:14,041
and I be just sitting there

1342
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:17,666
and his dumb ass
didn't even know the goddamn difference.

1343
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,666
Lady Reed, that ain't help me at all.

1344
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:25,791
I don't know. Maybe I'm just saying
it don't have to be all sexy and serious.

1345
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,208
You know, maybe it could...

1346
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:31,541
It can be funny.

1347
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:34,458
Exactly. It could be funny.

1348
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:44,416

What... What happened?

1370
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:43,125
I wrote a tender,
realistic love scene, okay?

1371
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:46,083
My whole goal with this movie
was to tell it like it is.

1372
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,625
[D'Urville] I dunno if it was tender,
I dunno if it was sexy,

1373
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,916
but it was funny as fuck.

Man, what you talking about?
What happened to all them little pieces?

Look, I spoke to the crew.

1393
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:31,708
They've been working under their rate
for a few weeks now.

1394
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:33,958
And I've been working for free
for a few days,

1395
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:37,875
and we're... we're on your side,
but if there's no film in the camera...

Another ten grand's not that simple, Rudy.
It's a lot of fucking money.

If this thing flops, you're working
for free for the rest of your life.

You created this situation.
Don't you go there.

01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,166
Did you put in any contingency
for overruns?

If that means mo' money,
then, no, I'm busted.

1410
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:17,625
But I can't go back there and tell 'em
to stop now. It'll crush everybody.

01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:21,208
Everybody put so much
into this fucking movie, man.

Come on, man. We just an inch away.

Okay, Rudy.

on <i>Rosemary's Baby.</i>

It's John Cassavetes.

He makes movies, too.

Yeah, man, he put up his last dime
to get it done.

1496
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:48,916
Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's not over
until you say, "That's a wrap."

1497
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:53,625
All right, y'all, that's a wrap.

1498
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:56,958
- No, no, no, no.
- Give us a Dolemite wrap.

1499
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,166
That's a motherfuckin' wrap!

1500
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:07,250
That's a no-business-born!

1501
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:08,333
Insecure!

1502
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:11,916
Barnyard motherfuckin' wrap!

1503
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:13,625
Yeah!

1504
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:21,083
[overlapping chatter]

1505
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:25,916
I'm a bad motherfucker, dude.
We made a hell of a movie.

1506
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:30,416
Congratulations, y'all.
We made this motherfucking movie!

1507
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:51,208

Comedian International.
How may I help you?

1510
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:18,208
Oh, no, Mr. Moore is available.
One second, please.

1511
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:25,500
Yes, this is Rudy Ray Moore.
Who am I speaking with?

1512
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:30,125
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Did you get a chance
to review my production?

1513
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:34,541
You did? Yes, okay. What...

1514
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,583
Well, yes, it was a real movie.

1515
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:40,666
It is a actual real movie,
and everybody got paid, yes.

1516
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:43,458
Yes, very professional production. Right.

1517
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:46,791
No, I learned-I learned kung fu
for the movie.

1518
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,208
I didn't know kung fu
before I started the movie.

1519
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:54,958
Yes. Oh, no, you... Yeah, you're right.
This was Lady Reed's first production.

1520
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:58,583
Right, this was her motion-picture debut.

1521
01:25:58,666 --> 01:25:59,666
Uh-huh.

1522
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:02,833
Really?

1523
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:04,708
Oh, well.

1524
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:09,416
Well, you know, we was gonna do
a fresh new edit on

1525
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:13,500
and was gonna change a couple of things
and a re-shoot for-for the ending.

1526
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:14,958
Change the ending ar...

1527
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:16,958
Right.

1528
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,375
Okay.

1529
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,750
All right, well, yeah.
No, we totally understand.

1530
01:26:24,875 --> 01:26:27,708
Yeah, man, thank you so much
for your consideration.

1531
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:46,666
Well... at least we had a good time.

1532
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:48,458
You know what, Ben? Fuck you, man.

1533
01:26:48,541 --> 01:26:51,083
Your ass had fun 'cause you ain't
have to pay for all this shit.

1534
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:52,750
I'm in debt up to my ears.

1535
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,476
I gave all my record royalties
to the Bihari Brothers,

1536
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,333
and don't nobody want this damn movie.

1537
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:59,541
Nigga, you got a whole lot of nerve

1538
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:01,958
ordering a extra side of greens
at a time like this.

1539
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:03,625
Pay for these fucking greens yourself.

1540
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:05,958
In fact, you're gonna all start paying
for your own shit,

1541
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:08,333
'cause I ain't no fucking endless faucet
of fucking money.

1542
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,625
Here, you pay for them waffles,
you pay for that burger,

1543
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,666
you pay for your shit,
your extra greens, nigga.

1544
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:13,875
You're having strawberries.

1545
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:16,791
You pay for your motherfucking
strawberries your damn self.

1546
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:19,291
I don't understand your attitude.

1547
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:22,750
I mean, it ain't like you ain't
never been told no before, Rudy.

1548
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:26,208
- I mean, you're the comeback king, man.
- Yeah, when we doing stuff I know about.

1549
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:28,833
Nightclubs and records.
Those is my world, okay?

1550
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:31,958
A man slam a door in my face,
I just find another door.

1551
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:33,333
Thought anybody could be a star.

1552
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:37,791
But apparently don't nobody wanna see
our ugly black ass up on the screen!

1553
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:40,041
Strawberry shortcake-eating motherfucker.

1554
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,791
- Hey, man, I like strawberry... Rudy!
- [Jerry] Come on, Rudy!

1555
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:46,958
<i>Yes, I was born
in a barrel of butcher knives,</i>

1556
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:50,375
then shot in the ass twice
with two Colt .45s.

1557
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:51,458
[audience laughing]

1558
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:55,250
Yes, I been slapped by a bear
and bit by an eel.

1559
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:59,375
I chew up railroad iron,
and I shit out steel.

1560
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:07,958
Yes, I was kicked out of South America
for fucking steers.

1561
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:11,791
<i>I fucked the she-elephant
till she broke down to tears.</i>

1562
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:18,333
<i>I just can't believe
I'm back here on this grind.</i>

1563
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:21,500
<i>I'm actually worse off than I was before,</i>

1564
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:23,458
'cause I don't even own my records
no more.

1565
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,916
Now what kind of fool works so hard
to build something up like that

1566
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,500
and just throw the shit all away?

1567
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:31,916
Ah-ah. Mm-mm.

1568
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,708
No, Rudy. You ain't no fool now.
Watch your mouth.

1569
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:39,083
I thought that movie
was gon' change everything,

1570
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:40,875
make me a fucking star.

1571
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:47,458
Well, you're still a star to me.

1572
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:52,791
[sighs] Okay.

1573
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:55,125
Good night, Lady Reed.

<i>Bobby Vale in the Morning,</i>
WFKK, Indianapolis.

1577
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:14,625
And we are so excited
to have Mr. Rudy Ray Moore,

1578
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:18,083
the man, the legend,
the phenomenon in studio.

1579
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:22,541
I'm looking right at him.
I'm sittin' with him right now,

1580
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:26,625
and he's gonna be in Indianapolis
all week performing at Gordy's Lounge,

1581
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,208
so give it up for Mr. Rudy Ray Moore.

1582
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:30,833
All right, man.
Really happy to be here today.

1583
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:34,125
Now, Rudy, I gotta ask you this
'cause I'm a hell of a fan.

1584
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,208
Yeah, man.

1585
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:39,375
There's a rumor
that you made a Dolemite movie.

1586
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,750
Is that true? And if it is,
when can we see this movie?

1587
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,583
I wish I could answer the question, y'all,

1588
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:47,541
but I really can't answer the question
at this time, 'cause I just don't know.

1589
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:50,375
You're not gon' give us nothing?

1590
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:54,291
I-I really can't really
give y'all the date...

1591
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:55,416
A hint.

1592
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:58,583
If I had a hint, I give it to y'all, man.
You know me.

1593
01:29:58,666 --> 01:30:00,083
You know if I had a date,

1594
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:02,958
I'd tell y'all right now,
but I don't know nothin'.

1595
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:08,416
Hey, we'll be right back
with Rudy Ray Moore.

1596
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:13,083
This is Bobby Vale, WFKK, Indianapolis.

1597
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,291
What the fuck is your problem, man?

1598
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:25,416
I'm tryin' to help you out.

1599
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,458
I'm in here promoting you, and you won't
even answer my fuckin' questions.

1600
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:31,041
Hey, look, Bobby.
I can't answer your goddamn question

1601
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:34,000
'cause the movie
ain't never comin' out, okay?

1602
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:37,166
- That don't make no sense.
- Yeah, but it's true. It's done.

1603
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:40,958
Don't nobody wanna show the motherfucker.
I don't know what to do, man.

1604
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:43,333
[Bobby] You know what?

1605
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:47,125
I got a cousin

1606
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:50,416
that manages a movie theater
called Uptown.

1607
01:30:51,291 --> 01:30:52,458
Maybe...

1608
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,041
should give him a call.

1609
01:30:58,750 --> 01:30:59,791
But what's he gonna do?

1610
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:03,583
I don't know. Maybe run it.
Play your damn movie. Fuck it. Can't hurt.

1611
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,000
And we are back.

1612
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:17,041
Now, we don't have
a midnight movie on Friday,

1613
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:20,000
so I suppose we could do it then.

1614
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:21,791
How does $500 sound?

1615
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,916
That sounds fair. Perfect.

1616
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,791
So, when can I receive my advance?

1617
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:30,666
- What? Advance?
- The money. When you gonna pay me?

1618
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:34,166
No. You see,
this is what they call four-walling.

1619
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:38,541
Yeah. You pay me,
and then you get all the ticket sales.

1620
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:40,916
We did it with <i>Billy Jack.</i>

1621
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,166
And I think we even did it
with <i>Grizzly Adams.</i>

1622
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:46,666
Man, you could clean up
if you successful.

1623
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:50,416
So I got to pay to show my movie?

1624
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:57,250
Well, goddamn. Am I gonna get
some of the popcorn money?

1625
01:31:57,333 --> 01:32:01,291
Oh, that's mine.
But you get all the box office.

1626
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:04,875
Now, if you promote the shit
out the movie... [laughs]

1627
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:07,000
aw, you could make some serious bread.

The Dunbar, man!

1632
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:38,083
Look, I need you to go up
into my bedroom in the Dunbar

1633
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:41,666
and get all five reels
and put 'em on a plane tonight!

1634
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,500
I need that movie in Indianapolis
right now!

1635
01:32:44,666 --> 01:32:46,791
Hey, my man. Hey, brother,
don't miss it. This Friday.

Uptown Theater.

1637
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:52,291
That's me, Rudy Ray Moore, baby.
Come on down and check me out.

1638
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:54,083
Ladies, come on down
to the Uptown Theater.

1639
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:56,934
Shit, we don't want you all up
into any damn movie with your tight ass.

1640

You got the cutest little baby.

Hi, little baby. Jibbee, jibbee.
Come down to Dolemite Theater, all right?

1642
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,541
Can't bring the baby, though.

But allow us now to sell ourselves to you.

1757
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:18,958
Dimension International...
we have two sweet spots.

1758
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:20,500
Redneck pictures.

1759
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:21,958
Right? Those are hillbillies

1760
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:25,416
and moonshine and sheriffs,
and those play at the Southern drive-ins.

1761
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:30,791
Now, the second sweet spot
is blaxploitation films.

1762
01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:35,208
It's films about blacks and for blacks.
And you know where they play?

1763
01:40:35,291 --> 01:40:39,958
They play in
the big beautiful movie showcases.

1764
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,750
And every downtown has 'em.

1765
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:47,125

They seat 2,000, 3,000 people.

1766
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:48,500
They used to be very popular,

1767
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:51,458
but then the white audience,
you know, skedaddled out to the suburbs.

1768
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:54,666
And what's left?
Well, the black urban audience.

1769
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:55,875
Now, I'll tell you what.

your film, these...

but resplendent movie palaces,

1772
01:41:05,375 --> 01:41:08,208
well, I think we can make a killing.

1773
01:41:10,458 --> 01:41:11,541
You know...

1774
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:14,166
in my new movie, there's a scene

1775
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:18,500
where big bad Willie Green
comes back to town, and my club is stolen.

1776
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:20,875
Takes all my receipts
and all my cash and all the girls.

1777
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:23,083
Everything I been building up
my whole life.

1778
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:26,583
He comes along, tries to take possession
'cause he think I don't know no better.

1779
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:29,583
But that's when I start to take charge...

1780
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:34,083
and I start showing motherfuckers
who's boss.

1781
01:41:34,166 --> 01:41:37,333
'Cause Dolemite ain't getting ripped off.

1782
01:41:37,416 --> 01:41:38,458
Can you dig it?

1783
01:41:39,916 --> 01:41:41,666

1784

Get him on the fucking phone,
and this time, you talk to him.

1793
01:42:12,541 --> 01:42:14,833
You're not gonna believe who paid us back.

1794
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:25,875
Yes, I put my finger in the ground

I just wanted to say
that I'm so grateful.

1814

I'm so grateful
for you putting me in this movie,

Hey, hey, I found a review.

01:44:18,833 --> 01:44:19,958
What's that say?

1831
01:44:23,625 --> 01:44:25,208
Go ahead, man. Just spit it out.

Go on, say what is it.

1833
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:33,000
"Dull-emite is a more apt title."

1834
01:44:34,541 --> 01:44:36,875
What'd you say?
What'd you just say? "Dull" or "Dol"?

1835
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,375
- Dull.
- Oh, really?

1836
01:44:38,458 --> 01:44:41,166
Dull-emite. Dull-emite.

1837
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:43,375
Um...

1838
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:46,250
"This could be
the lamest film of the year.

1840
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:55,250
Its only touch of originality
is in the introduction of...

1841

the fat man as romantic hero."

1842

- What's wrong with being portly?
- Not a damn thing.

1843
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:09,011
I don't see nothing wrong with adding
a few extra pounds, personally.

1844
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:10,809
- Exactly. Ain't nothing wrong...

Critics don't know nothing.

1850

I don't even know

They don't even like to have fun.
Nobody care what the critics say.
