1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,840
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,760
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,400
Ah Kiao, now, that you're all grown up,

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,360
you have to
listen to your parents, understand?

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,280
Okay.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,400
Make a wish!

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,800
I want to be a star when I grow up.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,840
It won't come true if you say it aloud!
Do it again!

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,080
I want to be a star when I grow up.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,040
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,560
All right, blow out the candles!
One, two, three!

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,040
Grandma!

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Good girl.

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Grandma, this show is addictive!

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,520
You're reading magazines, anyway.

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,080
Are you daring me to hit you?

17
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,080
I want to watch that drama series.

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,080
Grandma, look.

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,360
Dinner time!
We are having a big feast tonight!

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,960
Today, Auntie Chilli gave birth.

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,040
Uncle Satay made a bet with me
on whether it will be a boy or a girl.

22
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,160
Of course I won.

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,480
Aunty Chilli's stomach was so pointed,
of course it had to be a boy!

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,120
That Uncle Satay is a newcomer.
He doesn't know my prowess!

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,040
Why?

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,200
None of you are hungry?

27
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,200
Going on a fast?

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,080
Let's eat.

29
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,960
Wow! Today, we have chicken,
pork, mutton,

30
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,600
all kinds of meat!

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Why? It's good enough
we've got food to eat.

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,920
Business is so bad these days.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,080
I don't see you guys
bringing a bit more money home for me.

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,800
I've been wearing this blouse
for over ten years!

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,120
Luckily your blouse is not worth much.
Otherwise, you'd gamble it away, too.

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,360
If you're not happy,

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,040
you can always ask your father
to come back from Singapore to feed you!

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,160
With the little money
you make from selling pirated DVDs,

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,400
you think you can support the family?

40
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
All right, no fighting while eating rice.

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
But there's no rice on the table!

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,360
I'll get "comstipation"
from eating so much meat.

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
It's "constipation."

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,800
Fann Wong said it in <i>Chronicle Of Life.</i>

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Don't be stupid.

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,280
Fann Wong's pronunciation
is seldom accurate.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,120
But that show was dubbed.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,800
Comstipation, so what?

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,800
Constipation.

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,920
Are you daring me to hit you?

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,840
All right,
no toilet talk during meal time.

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,040
Ah Leng,

53
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,880
next time when you bet, make sure
you bet with the vegetarian food seller.

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,040
Let's eat.

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Here, Grandma.

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,560
- Hello?
- Hello.

57
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,079
You want to buy a television?

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
Of course I'm buying a television.

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,280
I wouldn't be buying
toilet bowls here, right?

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,120
Are you deaf?

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,040
This is a 26-inch, 1,099 ringgit.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,080
This is a 32-inch LED, 1,299 ringgit.

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
This is also a 32-inch LCD, 1,899 ringgit.

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
This is a 46-inch, 4,899 ringgit,

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,800
but you can pay
in 12 monthly installments.

66
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,160
This is also a 46-inch,

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,160
but Christopher Lee
looks more handsome in this set,

68
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,520
so, it's a bit more costly, 5,299 ringgit.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,640
Which television set do you want to buy?

70
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,200
Grandma,
this is Christopher Lee Meng Soon.

71
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
He is a big star in Singapore.

72
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,160
He's from Melaka.

73
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
Ah Soon.

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,480
Grandma, this is David Gan.

75
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,400
He's a hair stylist
for many celebrities in Singapore.

76
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,760
He's from Segamat.

77
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,840
Ah David.

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
And, Grandma,

79
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,800
here on the cover, we have
Singapore's most popular artiste,

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,680
and she's from Yong Peng!

81
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,760
Ah Kiao.

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,720
You know your mother
doesn't like you to go to Singapore.

83
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,160
I know, it's all because of Daddy.

84
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,840
It's okay. Grandma supports you.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,720
Ah Kiao Sis...

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,560
Look, I got 90 marks for my essay!

87
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,800
Wow! Fatty's so smart! Let me have a look!

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
"My Ambition.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,040
My ambition is to be
an international ballerina.

90
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,840
I love how graceful ballerinas are
when they are dancing.

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
They are as..."

92
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
As lithe as a swallow!

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
Wow! Fatty's Chinese is awesome!

94
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,400
Yes!

95
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,040
"Ever since I watched

96
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,400
<i>Swine Lake</i> on TV..."

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,680
It's <i>Swan Lake</i>, not <i>Swine Lake.</i>

98
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,440
<i>- Swine Lake.
- "Swan Lake."</i>

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
<i>- Swine Lake.
- "Swan Lake."</i>

100
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,640
Forget it!

101
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
Yes! <i>Swan Lake!</i>

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,680
"Ever since I watched <i>Swan Lake </i>on TV...

103
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,080
I just fell in love with ballet.

104
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,440
Once, my school organized a musical.
I acted as a tree.

105
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,200
I really loved the feeling
of being on stage.

106
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,960
I was not nervous at all."

107
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
- Really?
- Of course!

108
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,640
So, are you taking ballet lessons now?

109
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,320
Why not?

110
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,560
Mommy doesn't let me.
She says ballet's for girls.

111
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,360
Moreover, I'm so fat,
it'll just be a waste of money.

112
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Grandma, what are you looking for?

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,120
<i>The Kingdom and The Beauty.</i>

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,600
<i>The Kingdom and The Beauty</i> again?
You've seen it umpteen times!

115
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,600
There's a remake!

116
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Starring Kelly Chen,
Donnie Yen and Leon Lai.

117
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,720
I'll help you find it!

118
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,560
No, I want to see the original.

119
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,240
It's got my superstar, Zhao Lei.

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,960
You know, he used to court me...

121
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,080
and even wanted me to marry him.

122
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,520
Yes, I know...
He's your ex-boyfriend.

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,160
If not for my mom,
I would have married him already.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,640
If you had married him,
you wouldn't have to eat satay every day.

125
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,320
People should just follow their dreams
when they are young.

126
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,159
Don't think too much.

127
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
And when they are old?

128
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,280
When they are old,

129
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,799
they will just have to watch others
follow their dreams.

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,200
Grandma, do you know what my dream is?

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,680
I know. You want to be a star.

132
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,040
Do you think I can make it?

133
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,080
Why not?

134
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,920
You're beautiful and young.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And you watch so much TV.

136
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,680
Don't talk anymore. Help me find
my <i>Kingdom and The Beauty</i> quick.

137
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

138
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,040
You like it?

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,000
I told Grandma to sew
two swimsuits together. Smart, eh?

140
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,960
What's wrong? You don't like the color?

141
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,120
Mommy won't let me take lessons,
and I'm so fat. It's useless!

142
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,880
Don't be like this.
Where there's a will, there's a way.

143
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,320
Let me tell you a story.

144
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,960
Is it a ghost story?

145
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
Mommy says I'm not allowed
to listen to ghost stories.

146
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,040
I'll have nightmares.

147
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,600
It's not a ghost story, it's a true story!
And a beautiful one.

148
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,920
Once upon a time, there was a boy
who loved ballet just like you.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,360
But everybody said he looked like a sissy
when he danced.

150
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
What is a "sissy"?

151
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,960
Well, it's like effeminate.

152
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,400
What's "effeminate"?

153
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
Effeminate is...

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,320
something like that!

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,080
<i>People used to tease me and I would cry.</i>

156
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,720
<i>But now, I keep it all inside.
I'll prove you wrong.</i>

157
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
David Gan does ballet, too?

158
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,680
No! Anyway,
everyone said this boy danced like a girl.

159
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,720
So, his dad was like your mom,
and forbade him from doing ballet.

160
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,560
But he was very determined.

161
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
He kept practicing and even
got a scholarship to the Royal...

162
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,880
Whatever ballet college.

163
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,720
Eventually, he became
a world-renowned ballet star!

164
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,280
Ah Kiao Sis,
are you talking about Billy Elliot?

165
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
Yes, I think so.

166
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,000
That's just a movie!

167
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,280
It's not real!

168
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,720
Silly!

169
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,080
Some movies are based on true stories!

170
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,520
So, <i>Black Swan</i> was real, too?

171
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,640
Your mom took you to watch that movie?

172
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,680
I kept begging her to take me,
but she refused.

173
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,560
So I told your brother
I love to watch ballet movies

174
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,560
and he gave me the pirated DVD.

175
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Wow! That Black Swan was awesome!

176
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,840
She kept practicing
until she became a ballet star.

177
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,640
And she was both Black Swan
and White Swan!

178
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,960
That's right! If you keep practicing,
you can one day be a ballet star, too!

179
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,920
But she danced till she died on stage.
And she died a horrible death.

180
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,680
That's just a movie. It's not real.

181
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,680
What? So, Billy Elliot is not real either?

182
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,560
I'm so confused.
I'm going home to do my homework.

183
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,840
Otherwise, I'm going to get
another beating from my mom.

184
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,520
<i>I'll prove to you one day,</i>

185
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,560
<i>even if I'm a sissy,
or whatever you call it,</i>

186
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,160
<i>as long as I lead a better life than you,
I win.</i>

187
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,040
BRILLIANT TALENT SHOW

188
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,600
Ah Kiao, I've got something for you.

189
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,320
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?

190
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,200
This is for you.

191
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,560
What is it?

192
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,240
It's a gift from my superstar boyfriend,
Zhao Lei.

193
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,560
I can't keep this!

194
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Take it, keep it.

195
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,560
Is this your face?

196
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,720
Is this your face
or your boyfriend's face?

197
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Look carefully, it's a Chinese character!

198
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,720
It's not a happy face?

199
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,680
It's "longevity."

200
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,680
What do you think it means?

201
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,280
Your boyfriend
wants you to have a long life?

202
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,000
What's the use of having a long life

203
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,040
if you don't get to do what you love?

204
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,600
What would be the meaning of life?

205
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,640
Longevity would mean nothing.

206
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,200
You know,

207
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,560
my superstar boyfriend once said to me...

208
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,640
"Are you afraid of the dark?

209
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,800
If you are, you have not tasted
the bittersweetness of life."

210
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,600
Grandma,

211
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,600
I don't think it was your ex-boyfriend
who told you that.

212
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,560
Doesn't matter, just take it.

213
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,560
Anyway, your mom
will gamble it away one day.

214
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,880
In that case,
I'll safeguard it for you first.

215
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,680
All right, I'm going to bed.

216
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
Be careful!

217
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,680
Okay.

218
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Don't sleep too late.

219
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,960
ZOE AND FANN
ARE THEY FRIENDS OR COLLEAGUES?

220
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,600
"Zann."

221
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,080
Quite a nice name!

222
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,600
<i>Do you want to be a star?</i>

223
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
<i>Don't wait anymore!</i>

224
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,240
<i>Now's your chance!</i>

225
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,360
<i>If you want to be the star of tomorrow...</i>

226
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,800
<i>come down to Suntec Singapore
this weekend.</i>

227
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,200
Starz Search, <i>where your dreams come true.</i>

228
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
Ah Kiao!

229
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,240
Stop sleeping like a pig.

230
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,240
Come and sell DVDs with me
if you've nothing better to do.

231
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Kiao!

232
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,040
I'VE GONE TO SINGAPORE TO BE A STAR
- LEE KAR KIAO

233
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to <i>Starz Search!</i>

234
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Wow, you have potential!

235
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,760
Your skirt is very special!

236
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,760
Stay in line and don't cut the queue!

237
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,880
But most importantly,
get your $20 application fee ready!

238
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,720
Must be the exact amount.

239
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,640
We've no change for you, okay?

240
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,640
Hey! Stand in line!

241
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,680
$20!

242
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,480
The judge today is very kind.
It's Xiang Yun.

243
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
- Thank you!
- Okay.

244
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,560
355!

245
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,680
361, Lee Kar Kiao, 361!

246
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,720
I'm 361.

247
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,640
Zann!

248
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,120
You can't take part.

249
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,160
Why can't I?

250
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,560
Don't you watch TV?

251
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,560
The stars at our TV station
are mostly from China and Malaysia.

252
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,520
Our local audiences
are getting frustrated!

253
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,520
No foreigners allowed this year.

254
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,720
You didn't state that clearly
in your TV ad.

255
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,080
Of course we did! Look at our huge logo.

256
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>Starz Search.</i>

257
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,600
"S" for Singapore.
There's no "M" for Malaysia!

258
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,680
Only Singaporeans can take part!

259
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,240
Where did she come from?

260
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,440
Where's my $20?

261
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,400
Oh, my God!

262
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,560
Singapore is so hot!
I'm sweating all the time!

263
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,600
I don't know how the people here
keep their clothes on!

264
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,320
Yeah, and everyone
is supposed to speak English,

265
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
yet the cab drivers never understand us.

266
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,320
Maybe you should try saying
"lah" after everything.

267
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
Well, okay, lah. We have to be
in the Sengkang in ten minutes, lah.

268
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
Let's go!

269
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Caucasians are really gorgeous.

270
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,600
I think they're twins.

271
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,440
There's no problem. We'll get her for you.

272
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,160
Sure, no problem!

273
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,760
Don't worry, I'll call you when I'm free.

274
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Yes, sure.

275
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,480
Yes, she's free, no problem at all.

276
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,680
Excuse me? Can I help you?

277
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,600
Are you looking for models?

278
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,280
Did you call to make an appointment?

279
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,960
No, I got your address from Yellow Pages.

280
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
Did you bring any pictures?

281
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,320
Yes.

282
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
Your features are very nice,

283
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,520
but if you want to be one of our models,
you have to join our deportment course.

284
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,360
That's the basic modelling course. $400.

285
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,360
$400.

286
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,640
After that, you have to take
the professional modelling course, $600.

287
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,760
$600.

288
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,640
If you sign up for both the courses now,
it's only $800.

289
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,800
$800.

290
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,440
After that, you have to take pictures
for your portfolio,

291
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,880
but you don't have to do that here.

292
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,280
You can find your own photographer,
but it's more expensive.

293
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,640
We can recommend a photographer.

294
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,760
We will provide the hair and makeup.
It's only $500.

295
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,640
It's more expensive out there,
ours is only $500.

296
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
You will get 36 shots,
but we will keep the negatives.

297
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,200
So, how?

298
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,560
It costs so much to be a model?

299
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,680
You think it's free?

300
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,920
I'll show you my personal photos
for reference.

301
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
Take a look.

302
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,800
Wow! You look gorgeous!

303
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,320
Gorgeous, right?
Our photographer is very good and classy.

304
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,120
The makeup is fantastic, too.

305
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,920
Take a closer look,
they say I resemble an artiste.

306
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,280
She's very popular!

307
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,440
You look like Patricia Mok!

308
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
Excuse me, I don't look like Patricia Mok.

309
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,080
My mouth is not as big, okay?

310
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,720
Look carefully.
Don't you think I look like Zoe Tay?

311
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,760
You do look a bit like her.

312
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,800
I told you!

313
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,440
So, how?

314
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,680
I didn't bring enough money today.
Can I go home and think about it?

315
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,280
What a waste of time!

316
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,080
Come back when you have thought about it.

317
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,640
Thank you both so much.

318
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
Oh, my goodness!
She wants to be a model with such looks?

319
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,120
She even brought her holiday photos!

320
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,560
That's right!

321
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,200
But honestly, you really do look like
Patricia Mok in this photo.

322
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,440
BRAND NEW
DAVID GAN

323
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,360
Hi! Can I help you?

324
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,280
Are you hiring? I'm a shampoo girl.

325
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm sorry, we're not looking
for shampoo girls at the moment.

326
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,440
Is David Gan in?

327
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,080
David. He's now in Cannes with Ziyi Zhang

328
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,280
and then he will go to Beijing
with Li Gong... I mean, Gong Li.

329
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,240
Excuse me,
would you like to get a haircut?

330
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,720
How much is the cheapest haircut here?

331
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,800
Our junior stylist starts at $120.

332
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,400
Thank you.

333
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,680
You're welcome!

334
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,640
Hi, David!

335
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,120
David Gan, you're my idol.
Look, I brought your...

336
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,640
Hi.

337
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,640
This David's got hair?

338
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,920
Do you know me?

339
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,200
I'm so sorry, David.

340
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,160
She's just a shampoo girl,
and she's looking for a job.

341
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,040
Sorry! I thought you were David Gan.

342
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,360
No. It's okay.
So, are you going to hire her?

343
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,040
No.

344
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,680
That's a pity.
Such good skin, good figure.

345
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,560
Hey, maybe you can come and work for me?

346
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
We need new girls.

347
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,520
The thing to remember about Pure Beauty

348
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,560
is that the secret to perfect skin

349
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,360
can be found
in nature's vast bounty of ingredients.

350
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,760
Ingredients! They're raw material.

351
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,040
Yes.

352
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,520
If you don't understand anything,
just read the brochure, okay?

353
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,680
If you have any questions,

354
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,840
you can consult
Earness and Vaness from DHC, okay?

355
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,360
Hey, please help her
with the English-speaking customers,

356
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,520
and she can help you
with the Chinese-speaking ones,

357
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,920
especially the ones
from China and Malaysia.

358
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,160
They are very helpful, okay?

359
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,000
Hello, Vaness. Hello, Earness.
My name is Zann.

360
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,120
PLEASE TURN THE VOLUME DOWN AFTER 11 PM

361
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,640
Is there anyone sitting here?

362
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Come sit down.

363
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,840
The chicken rice and noodles here
are not bad,

364
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,120
or you want some buns?

365
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,040
Miss, are you alone?

366
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,400
Watching TV?

367
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,800
I've seen this show. Very tragic.

368
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,680
The guy doesn't even love the girl,
but the girl is still very devoted.

369
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,720
I can't stand him!

370
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,600
- These type of guys...
- I want to go to the toilet!

371
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,600
You want to go to the toilet now?

372
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,480
I want to go to the toilet!

373
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,520
I told you to go at the shopping center.
Why didn't you say then?

374
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,920
I want to go to the toilet!

375
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,400
The toilet here is very dirty.

376
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,640
I want to go to the toilet!

377
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,960
You will slip and fall
if you step on some shit!

378
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,560
I want to go to the toilet!

379
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,160
Stop kicking me!

380
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,640
I want to go to the toilet!

381
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
Stop shouting at me!

382
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,400
I want to go to the toilet!

383
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,600
Stop kicking me, I'm warning you...

384
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,160
I want to go to the toilet!

385
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,160
How come there's no <i>Good Morning Singapore</i>
on the TV today?

386
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,640
I don't know.

387
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,960
Uncle, today's Sunday.
There's no <i>Good Morning Singapore.</i>

388
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,360
That's only from Mondays to Fridays.
Weekends are reserved for kids' programs.

389
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,680
Right! I forgot about that!

390
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,600
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

391
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,880
Kopi O, no sugar.

392
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,000
Kopi O, no sugar!

393
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,760
Singaporeans are so kind,
hiring the deaf-mute to be coffee boys.

394
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,760
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

395
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,080
You are not a deaf-mute?

396
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
No.

397
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,240
Bye!

398
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,640
Alpha-arbutin,
technologically advanced brightener,

399
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,040
used to reduce visible discoloration
on the skin caused by sun and age,

400
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,960
and to promote a more radiant skin tone.

401
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,640
Used in our whitening range, Camu Camu!

402
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,680
Very good!

403
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Next!

404
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,920
Acerola.

405
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,200
The dark circle around your nipple.

406
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,720
You're wrong! That's areola.
I said acerola, stupid!

407
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,720
That's what I meant, stupid!
I was just kidding.

408
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,600
Acerola. Caribbean berry.

409
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,560
One of the world's
richest natural sources of vitamin C

410
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,560
that helps brighten the uneven skin tone.

411
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,400
All right, smarty pants!

412
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,920
Vaness... I got big ones, you know?

413
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
Big what?

414
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,200
Areolas!

415
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
How big?

416
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,600
No!

417
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,600
Yes!

418
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,520
No!

419
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,560
Yes!

420
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,600
You don't believe me? I show you?

421
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,840
Come, let's go to the toilet.

422
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,200
Okay!

423
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,840
- Hello.
- Yes.

424
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,320
Can I help you?

425
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,600
Yes. I'm actually looking
for whitening products.

426
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,720
Why? Is it that Indians cannot use
whitening products?

427
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,480
Can! Can you speak Mandarin?

428
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,040
I do not speak Mandarin!

429
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,200
You are a consultant.
You must be able to speak English.

430
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
It's okay.

431
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,320
Do you sell whitening product?

432
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Whitening. Black to white.

433
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,040
Whitening?

434
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,600
Yeah, that's what I've been saying!

435
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,000
- Camu Camu!
- No! Kumar!

436
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,600
No, Camu Camu!

437
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,600
Brand name, Camu.

438
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Camu.

439
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,600
Camu Camu.

440
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,640
This one?

441
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,560
- Does it help?
- I don't know.

442
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,080
You work here and you don't know?

443
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,320
I am not DHC. I am Pure Beauty.

444
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,680
You are pure beauty?

445
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,160
- Pure Beauty, I show you.
- Oh, product.

446
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,520
Look, Earness,

447
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,800
that Malaysian girl
is trying to take away our customer!

448
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,000
Do something!

449
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,960
All these foreigners.

450
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,520
Sorry, miss, we were just in the toilet.

451
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
To powder our noses.

452
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,600
Oh, my God, it's Kumar!

453
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,000
Kumar, my sister Barbarella
and I just love you!

454
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,680
You are our God!

455
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,200
Goddess! In real life,
you look so much slimmer.

456
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,320
Because on TV, you are so much bigger!

457
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,760
You know, you are like very big!

458
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,480
The camera is so cruel to you TV stars!

459
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,040
Yes, actually, I have lost weight.

460
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,960
What you were watching on TV

461
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,080
is the repeat telecast of <i>Oh, Carol,</i>
which was ten years ago.

462
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,680
Yeah! Sure! Sorry.
My friend is not a Singaporean.

463
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,840
Yes, fresh off the boat, ma'am!

464
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,560
So, Kumar, how can we help you today?

465
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,560
Although, you don't look like
you need any help at all.

466
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm here to actually buy
some whitening products.

467
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,600
Sure! You have made the right decision!

468
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,800
Welcome to DHC!

469
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,760
You have a nice day, sir.

470
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,640
You have a nice day, too.
Thank you very much.

471
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,360
Thank you, Kumar!

472
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,720
And remember to introduce DHC
to all your actor and actress friends,

473
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,160
like Norleena Salim.

474
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,880
Yes, I will, because Norleena Salim
needs a lot of tightening products.

475
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,520
But you are my favorite actress, Kumar.

476
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,760
I love you more than
even Leticia Bongnino!

477
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,600
Who is Bongnino?

478
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,040
Hello, Kumar. My name is Zann.
I'm also an actress.

479
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,600
I know you are a famous actor.

480
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,280
Can you introduce me to the TV station?

481
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,160
This is my telephone number.

482
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,640
You know, I'm not with any TV station.

483
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,560
But let me tell you,
I have an agent friend

484
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,640
who likes to handle artistes,
just like you,

485
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,640
who sound very funny.

486
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
- Please call.
- Thank you!

487
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,240
You're most welcome. Bye!

488
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,920
Did he say agent or lawyer?

489
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,920
"Samuel Seow."

490
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,760
Sounds fake!

491
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,240
Bet it's only a prop! Take it back!

492
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,160
Hi! Can I help you?

493
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Yes. I called just now.
I have an appointment with...

494
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,640
- With Mr. Seow?
- Mr. Seow!

495
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,680
Go straight, turn right, to the last room.

496
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,560
- Thank you!
- Welcome!

497
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
Mr. Seow, your client is here.

498
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,720
Come in.

499
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,240
Hello.

500
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
Hi! You look so much younger
than I thought you would.

501
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,200
Please have a seat!

502
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,640
So, have you thought about this carefully?

503
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,000
Sorry, can you speak Mandarin?

504
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,280
Chinese ed?

505
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,239
Sorry, from your information,
I couldn't tell you were Chinese-educated.

506
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,040
So, have you thought about this carefully?

507
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,639
Well, I'm not getting any younger.

508
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,080
I thought if I don't give it a try now,
I might regret it in the future.

509
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,920
This is such an important matter.
How can you just "give it a try"?

510
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,679
It's obvious that you haven't
given enough thought to it.

511
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,600
I suggest you go home
and give it serious consideration

512
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,560
before coming back to me.

513
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,600
I've thought about this very carefully.

514
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,560
I've loved your local productions
since I was little,

515
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,679
like <i>Golden Pillow</i>, <i>The Morning Express</i>,
<i>The Unbeatables</i>, <i>The Unbeatables II</i>

516
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,360
and <i>The Unbeatables III</i>.
I love these shows!

517
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,719
I know every line
and I can act as every character!

518
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,639
Recently, there was a re-run
of the character Bobo and that Aiyoyo!

519
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,920
I can do them all!

520
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,560
Mr. Seow, these are my photographs.
Please have a look.

521
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,360
If you are willing to give me a chance,

522
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,440
I will work very hard
and not let you down.

523
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,600
You're not here to settle your divorce?

524
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Divorce? I'm not even married yet.

525
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,240
<i>Sorry, Mr. Seow, your real client is here.</i>

526
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,480
<i>I think that girl is here
to audition to be your artiste.</i>

527
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,520
Can you please get the client to wait
in the conference room for a while?

528
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,800
What is it that you do?

529
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,160
In my hometown, I sell televisions.

530
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,200
In Singapore, I am Pure Beauty.

531
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,360
I'm a beauty consultant at Watsons.

532
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,640
I can see your passion,
but I can't see your X factor.

533
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,520
We are running an
artiste management company,

534
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
not an extras agency.

535
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,120
I can't just sign on anyone
who walks in here.

536
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,680
I'll tell you honestly,
your looks are run of the mill.

537
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,440
Besides, your Malaysian accent
is so thick.

538
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,240
For you to make it
in our local entertainment industry,

539
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,520
it would be an impossible task.

540
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,920
I think you'd better go back to Malaysia
and sell televisions.

541
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,320
Thank you.

542
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,360
Pure Beauty super white...

543
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,760
Pure Beauty super brightening series
combines the latest whitening technology,

544
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,280
including the advanced AWC...

545
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,160
I've already paid for my coffee.

546
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,400
Are you going to act in a commercial?

547
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,160
I'm a Pure Beauty consultant.

548
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,080
Wow! Your jade is very beautiful!

549
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,960
My grandmother gave this to me.
It's an antique.

550
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,880
My drama's starting soon.

551
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,640
The roads are so quiet!

552
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,080
Three cups of coffee!
Everyone is still away on holiday.

553
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,680
What are they watching? Drama series?

554
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,640
It's Saturday.
We should be watching football!

555
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,920
Uncle, pass me the remote control!

556
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,560
Let's watch football, not this!

557
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,120
Thank you!

558
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,640
This is more exciting!

559
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,520
This must be rigged!

560
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,520
It's a goal! Did you bet?

561
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,720
Yes, I did!

562
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,120
The police cars are here!

563
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,640
Grandma!

564
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,120
Mom?

565
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,200
Grandma?

566
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,160
Mom?

567
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,640
Grandma?

568
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,600
Finally back?

569
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,800
What happened?

570
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,680
The doctor said fluid seeped
into Grandma's lungs.

571
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,120
She was critically ill
and was in the hospital for a few days.

572
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,240
Then one day... she gave up.

573
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,120
I think Grandma didn't want
to waste our money.

574
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,680
Before she passed away,

575
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,360
she reminded us to put her altar
in your room, to protect you.

576
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,760
Mom gambles all day now.

577
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
She hardly ever opens her stall.

578
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,760
It's all your fault! Left without a word!
Couldn't find you anywhere!

579
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,640
Where did you run off to?

580
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,760
Do you know how much Grandma loved you?

581
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Ah Kiao Sis! You're back.
I missed you so much.

582
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,160
Wow, Fatty, haven't seen you in a while.
You seem to have gained weight again.

583
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,600
Ah Kiao Sis, your grandma said
you went to Singapore to become a star.

584
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
No.

585
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,720
Your grandma said
you would become very famous

586
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,920
because she gave you her "longevity."

587
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,080
Your whole family will then be able
to move to Singapore.

588
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,680
Your mom wouldn't have to be a hawker,

589
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,920
and your brother
wouldn't have to sell DVDs anymore.

590
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,320
Ah Kiao Sis, have you become a superstar?

591
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,000
I wouldn't know
because Mommy won't let me watch TV.

592
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,520
Not at all.

593
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,720
I'm thinking of coming back
to sell televisions.

594
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,440
I wonder if the boss has found anyone.

595
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,040
Your ambition is to be on television,
not sell televisions!

596
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,640
Fatty, you wouldn't understand.

597
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,560
When you grow up, you will realize
that dreams are what you wake up from.

598
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,040
But, Ah Kiao Sis, you said it yourself!
Where there's a will, there's a way.

599
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,240
Look at me,
I don't even eat potato chips anymore.

600
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,640
When I'm hungry, I just eat broccoli.

601
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,000
What's more, my mommy said
that if I lose weight,

602
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,920
she will let me take ballet lessons!

603
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,640
But you said that the
black swine danced to her death on stage.

604
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Yes, but she died
a very successful ballet star.

605
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,160
Everybody dies one day.
Isn't it better to die already famous?

606
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,680
You seem to have become smarter
now that you no longer eat potato chips.

607
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,800
Not at all. It's actually your grandma
who told me all this.

608
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,880
Ah Kiao Sis, don't you forget that sissy.

609
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,520
David Gan?

610
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,680
No! Billy Elliot, silly!

611
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,080
Hey, I've seen Thomas Ong before!

612
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,600
I've also seen him before.
He's been around for almost 20 years.

613
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,600
How come he never ages?

614
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,000
His acting is not bad, eh?

615
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,440
He's all right!

616
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,760
- Kopi O...
- No sugar.

617
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,320
I just made it.

618
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,720
Thank you.

619
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,400
Hey!

620
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,600
It's for you. It's free.

621
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,280
Thank you. Bye.

622
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,600
Oh, my God.

623
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,120
Vaness, look!

624
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,360
This man is so rich!

625
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,560
Wow!

626
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,600
16 wives and 40 children!
I can't believe it!

627
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,240
Zoe Tay and Fann Wong
are acting in a new show together.

628
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,960
But they are enemies, right?

629
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,320
Please, it's been so long already.
They're no longer enemies.

630
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,240
Look, Christopher Lee is also in the show.

631
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,600
Then that Zoe Tay
can ask them to have babies again.

632
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,000
Wow! You're from the Philippines.
You know about this, too?

633
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,400
Correct!

634
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,560
This auntie never gives up.

635
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,880
- No!
- Yes!

636
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,920
- No!
- Yes!

637
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,080
I don't believe you!

638
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,440
Show me. Come. Let's go to the toilet!

639
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,600
One, two, one, two. Lose weight.

640
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,560
Excuse me, is this where I audition
to join the TV station?

641
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,720
Go there to take your application form!

642
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,360
The agencies here are so small.

643
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,280
In Petaling Jaya,
our agency is two storeys high.

644
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,920
Next time, will you take me along?

645
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,320
Hey, I've done car shows before, you know?

646
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,560
Why do I have to wait that long?

647
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,680
I still have a commercial to shoot later.

648
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,520
Hello, my name is Zann.

649
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,040
I've come to Singapore
for over a month already.

650
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,680
I'm from Yong Peng. Where are you from?

651
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,240
Serangoon Gardens.

652
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,280
There's such a place in Malaysia?

653
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,800
You are also from Malaysia?

654
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,880
I'm from Yong Peng.

655
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,680
Can you speak Mandarin?

656
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,720
My Mandarin is awesome.

657
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,080
When I dance, I'm as lithe as a swallow!

658
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,040
Are you free tomorrow?

659
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,720
Tomorrow? Should be fine.

660
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:22,120
Okay, half day tomorrow,
from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Okay?

661
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,040
$25, half-day.

662
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,600
Report at E5 at 6:00... No, 7:00 a.m.

663
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,680
Your local TV station is called E5?

664
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,120
E5 is the makeup unit.
If there's nothing else, sign here.

665
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,720
What will I be acting as?

666
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,720
You will be a...

667
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,640
Here.

668
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,080
Nurse.

669
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,200
Nurse.

670
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,600
Will I be acting
as a kind or vicious nurse?

671
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,160
Will I be dispensing medicine
or giving injections?

672
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,440
Am I a happy or depressed nurse?

673
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,560
You're not open yet?

674
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,040
So early today?

675
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,800
I'm going to be an actress today.

676
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
Let me go boil some water.
Kopi O, no sugar.

677
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,200
Hey, maybe not today.
I'm afraid I'll be late.

678
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,040
Gotta go! Bye.

679
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,920
Hello! This is a TV station.
Where are you going?

680
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,680
I'm here to act, as a nurse.

681
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,680
You're an extra?

682
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,760
You go there, radio gate.

683
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,720
Not radio, TV.

684
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,040
I know.

685
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,440
But you cannot come here.
You must go there, radio gate.

686
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,600
Not radio, TV!

687
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,800
I'm acting as a nurse!

688
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,960
I know! You go there, E5!

689
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,120
- Not here.
- E5.

690
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,600
That side.

691
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,600
- Not there?
- No, there.

692
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,040
Hey, girl!

693
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,160
Show me your pass.

694
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,480
I'm here to act.

695
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,560
I'm an extra.

696
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,680
Extra.

697
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,920
What is your name?

698
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,640
Zann Lee.

699
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,000
Zann Lee?

700
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,920
- Lee Kar Kiao.
- Lee Kar Ki.

701
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,080
Kiao. Lee Kar Kiao.

702
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,640
- Kiao.
- Lee Kar Kiao.

703
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,240
No such name!

704
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,560
I'm sure there is.

705
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,320
I'm acting. I'm an extra.

706
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,040
Swee Yong.
I'm from Auntie Swee Yong Company.

707
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,800
Swee Yong.

708
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,840
Okay. You show me
your identification card.

709
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,040
-IC
-IC?

710
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,200
No. Not this one.
Real identification card.

711
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,400
I can't bring the original one out.
I might lose it.

712
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,840
That's why I had it photocopied.

713
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,520
I'm late already.
I'm an extra. I'm late already.

714
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,560
Do you think my job is very easy?

715
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,840
Even Zoe Tay needs a pass to enter...

716
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,200
- You! Are you Lee Kar Kiao?
- I'm Zann Lee.

717
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,520
- You! Do you know you are late?
- I know.

718
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,080
I was here early but this security guard
wouldn't let me in.

719
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,160
He kept insisting
on seeing my identification card.

720
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,960
Sorry. This is one of my people.

721
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,680
Go and do your make-up. Go!

722
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,120
Where's the makeup unit?

723
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,640
You don't even know
where the makeup unit is?

724
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,800
Turn left and go straight!

725
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,920
Sorry. I have the identification card.

726
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,600
What a good life you have now.

727
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,520
You've got your husband taking care of you
and your kid is so cute.

728
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,880
You can come and act
when you feel like it.

729
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,360
Unlike some of our female artistes here,
after acting for so long,

730
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,520
they still get shouted at
by the directors.

731
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,680
I heard you just opened a new cake shop,
Twelve Cupcakes. You're so capable.

732
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,720
And you thought beauty queens
are only capable of looking good on stage.

733
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,560
We're capable in the kitchen, too!

734
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,760
You're a beauty queen?

735
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,640
Miss Singapore 2001.

736
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,560
Right. I'm so sorry.

737
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,640
I should watch the news more often.
Sorry.

738
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,640
What role are you playing?

739
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,760
Nurse.

740
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,720
I must have offended someone lately.

741
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,080
They keep casting me as an auntie.

742
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,520
How? Did you pass?

743
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,440
Miss Grouchy plays a sweet girl

744
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,040
and I'm playing
Miss Grouchy's grouchy sister-in-law.

745
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,240
They passed Miss Grouchy's sweet girl look
but not my grouchy sister-in-law look!

746
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,360
No worries. I'll touch up your makeup.

747
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,240
Get up. Diva Koh Bee Cheng is waiting.

748
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,680
Who's that? Is she our new artiste?

749
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,120
No way. She's just an extra.

750
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,880
Sister, don't sabotage me.

751
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,320
Extras nowadays have blogs
and Twitter accounts.

752
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,600
They will call me a shrew
if I'm not careful.

753
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,160
Stop laughing. Quick.

754
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,200
Okay.

755
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,600
Sister, you spent
such a long time touching up.

756
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,560
Is there a difference?

757
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,520
Check out the lips, they are crimson.

758
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,640
I need to go on a course.

759
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,760
Get lost.

760
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,280
Cynthia Koh, are you done?

761
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,920
The executive producer is waiting for you.

762
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,640
Who are you to call me Cynthia Koh?

763
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,560
Even Dai Yangtian
calls me Big Sister Koh, okay?

764
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,640
- Sister, I'm off.
- Bye.

765
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,760
Hey, come here.

766
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,240
Done.

767
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,200
I'm playing a nurse in a hospital,
not a nurse in an adult film.

768
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,080
Hey, take off your mask.

769
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,080
You are acting as a cancer patient
and you're wearing lipstick? Take it off!

770
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,240
Quick!

771
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,640
Wait! All right. Smile.

772
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,520
Wait! What is that?

773
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,680
Have you ever seen cops
wearing diamond studs? Take it off.

774
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,640
Hey, take off your hair clip.

775
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,680
Hey! Have you seen enough?
Don't block the path. Go over there.

776
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,720
Wait.

777
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,720
Don't spoil Swee Yong's reputation.

778
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,560
Guys, remember
to turn off your mobile phones.

779
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,280
The assistant producer
for this drama is very fierce.

780
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,880
Karen, they got you to act as a man again?

781
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,760
Susan, I haven't seen you
since <i>Golden Pillow.</i>

782
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,360
Where did you disappear to?

783
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,160
Did Yiliang cast you in his movie?

784
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,360
He contacted me directly.

785
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,960
Hey, first time?

786
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
You didn't bring anything
to pass the time?

787
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,280
I only took a half-day leave.
And it's almost 1:00 p.m.

788
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,720
There's always a long waiting time.
That's why they book us the whole day.

789
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,440
You have lines?

790
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,640
"Sir, please don't be like this."

791
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,600
Wow, not bad.

792
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,040
I didn't have any lines on my first day.

793
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,600
When the bomb landed,
we had to jump like this.

794
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,160
And after that,
we still had to shake like this.

795
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,960
You think that's easy?

796
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Haven't you ever acted being shot?

797
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,680
Let me demonstrate for you.

798
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,640
Hang on, it's a little bit painful.

799
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,400
One shot.

800
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,680
Two shots.

801
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,640
Machine gun shots!

802
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,680
Are you a full-time actress?

803
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,560
Of course not.
There's so little money in this.

804
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,680
I help my mother sell laksa.

805
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,560
But I've been acting a long time.

806
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,280
The APs look for me directly,
and I'm not from any agency.

807
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,640
The APs all know me very well.

808
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,320
You just have to say "Angie"
and all the APs know.

809
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,200
So, besides playing dead,
what else have you acted as?

810
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,720
Everything. Let me sit down first.

811
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:52,240
I've acted as doctors, nurses,
bar girls, reporters, office girls.

812
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,280
I've acted in many office serials.

813
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,280
Have you seen <i>New Generation?</i>
I was the one who got married.

814
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,640
Li Nanxing was my colleague
and my hair was a nice bob.

815
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,240
Maybe I have a different look now,
you don't recognize me.

816
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,720
Before that,
I was in a series with Terence Cao.

817
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,040
Remember?
Terence said he was getting married?

818
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,080
Do you know why he didn't in the end?

819
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,680
It was because of this series.

820
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,680
No, it wasn't me. I'm not his type.
He was with...

821
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,600
Nurse B?

822
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,560
It's my turn.

823
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,640
Next time, remind me to tell you
who it was, okay?

824
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,520
I will also tell you

825
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,800
which artiste Ping Hui
was going out with before.

826
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,280
Next time, better demonstrate
with less strength.

827
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,600
- Romeo Tan, right?
- Yes.

828
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,320
- First drama?
- Yeah.

829
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,520
Okay, whatever I do later,
you just follow and support, okay?

830
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,440
Okay, sure.

831
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,680
I've got a question.

832
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,160
We are filming a Mandarin serial, right?

833
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,880
Yeah, I'm bilingual, effectively.

834
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,840
I can sing and dance, too!

835
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,840
You, <i>Starz Search.</i>

836
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,800
I, <i>Singapore Idol.</i>

837
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,680
Okay.

838
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,080
You, what number?

839
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,600
What shade number?

840
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,360
Am I too fair? I better go touch up!

841
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,560
Later, after Nat says his lines,
I will cue you.

842
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,680
Then you will stand here
and say your line, okay?

843
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,680
You will kill me?

844
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,640
"Cue" means prompting you to come in.
You don't even know "cue"?

845
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,600
Swee Yong said you were a Grade B extra.
Looks like you are not even a Grade D.

846
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,600
You're so going to get me into trouble.
The director is going to kill me.

847
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,200
Yes, director!

848
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,680
Romeo Tan has gone to touch up again!

849
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,600
I'm done.

850
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,680
All right, he's back.

851
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,000
Okay, everybody, stand by.

852
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,320
<i>Our Hospital</i> scene 50, take one!

853
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,680
Camera rolling and action!

854
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:16,600
Grandma! It's all my fault, Grandma!

855
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,080
You still have the nerve to be here?

856
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,760
Where were you all this time?

857
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,680
You are worse than a beast!

858
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,040
Grandma...

859
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,960
Grandma, please forgive me.

860
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,320
Grandma, please forgive me!

861
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,600
Sir, please don't be like this.

862
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,680
I swear I'll always
come and visit you. Grandma...

863
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,360
Grandma, please don't die.

864
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,680
Grandma, please don't die!

865
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,680
Do you remember? When I was little,
you doted on me the most.

866
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,240
Doted, my foot.

867
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,600
Grandma loves you so much.

868
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,880
When she needed you the most,
where were you?

869
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,960
<i>Haven't you said enough?</i>

870
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,360
No. I've been taking care
of Grandma all this time.

871
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,520
What about you?
What kind of a grandson are you?

872
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,080
I was busy. I had work to do!

873
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,760
You have work? Me, too!

874
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,200
Grandma!

875
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,440
Are you okay?

876
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,760
Cam one, go back to the nurse.

877
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,880
Yes! Nurse.

878
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,720
Correct, that's her!

879
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,080
Okay. Give me a close-up.

880
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:38,640
Zoom in, slowly zoom in.
A little bit more.

881
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,400
Cut! Okay! Lovely!

882
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,640
Did you see that? Oh, my God!

883
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,960
Did you see that?

884
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,280
Yes, I saw that.

885
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,600
Some extras really know
how to steal the scene.

886
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,200
How dare she even memorize my lines?

887
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,000
That's right! Can't stand it.

888
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,480
If she's really that good,
why doesn't she join <i>Starz Search?</i>

889
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,480
Or <i>Singapore Idol.</i>

890
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,760
<i>Singapore Idol.</i>

891
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,640
Thank you!

892
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,640
Wow! Good take!

893
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,440
Good take!

894
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,640
Hey! Hello!

895
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,640
I'm the director of this drama.
Don't be scared, you did great.

896
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,600
Did you see that?

897
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,320
Your acting, your feeling,
it was superb. Just like a lead actress!

898
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,440
You must have majored in Drama
or done some theatre.

899
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,680
I sell televisions in Yong Peng.

900
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,280
Well, the more TV you watch,
the better your acting gets!

901
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,560
Anyway, I'm starting a new drama series.
We're looking for a female lead

902
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,120
and I think you are
who we are looking for.

903
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,160
Great.

904
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,360
If you're interested, just give me a call.

905
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,760
I'm Director Boris.

906
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,040
Remember, you must call me.
You're the one.

907
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,360
Let's watch the playback!

908
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,360
<i>What about you?
What kind of a grandson are you?</i>

909
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,680
<i>- I was busy, I had work to do!
- You have work? Me, too!</i>

910
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,800
<i>Grandma!</i>

911
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,320
<i>Grandma, are you okay?</i>

912
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,720
<i>- Grandma!
- Grandma!</i>

913
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,800
<i>- Grandma!
- Grandma!</i>

914
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,680
Wow! She got a close-up on her first day?

915
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,320
I thought you were sick.
You still managed to run so fast?

916
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,160
And for a sick person,
you really wear a lot of makeup.

917
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,360
I hate it when people lie to me.

918
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,600
Luckily, Earness and Vaness
told me about your working attitude.

919
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,160
They said you've been
passing your number to customers

920
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,880
and asking them to give you jobs, right?

921
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,680
Well, if you don't appreciate this job
that I gave you,

922
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,520
you don't have to come in anymore.

923
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,680
Sorry.

924
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,680
Excuse me, do you still have any cakes?

925
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,760
Do you want a whole cake?
They are all sold out.

926
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,520
Well, except for one.

927
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,000
They were supposed to collect it today,

928
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,920
but they called to say
it's not needed anymore.

929
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,320
But there are already
some words on the cake.

930
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,320
Do you still want it?

931
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
Wait here.

932
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,680
From a birthday celebration
to a funeral, that's life.

933
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,080
What's your name?

934
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,560
My name's Christopher.

935
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,680
Ah Seng, two Teh O!

936
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,280
Ah Seng is just my nickname.

937
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,120
For you. It's free.

938
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,400
Bye.

939
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,640
How many times do I have to tell you?
My new name is Christopher!

940
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,040
HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRANDMA!

941
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,960
HERE'S WISHING YOU
HAPPINESS AND LONGEVITY

942
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Mom.

943
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,560
- Hey!
- Finally back?

944
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,720
Good to have you back.

945
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,760
Look what I bought for you guys.

946
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,560
Don't eat this anymore.
It's your favorite, roast duck.

947
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,600
- Roast duck!
- And all these goodies from Watsons.

948
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,640
This is a knee support.
Your knees are weak.

949
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,560
Not those, knees!

950
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,320
- Right here!
- And this is for men, SPF15.

951
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,600
Not bad, for the face.

952
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,640
This face mask is suitable
for both men and women.

953
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,600
This is good, it's DHC!

954
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,920
What C?

955
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,760
Wow! Bird's Nest!

956
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,640
Fantastic!

957
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,240
Thank you, Grandma.

958
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,399
Mom, it's starting soon!

959
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:40,720
Okay.

960
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,680
Ah Leng!

961
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,720
Uncle Satay, you're here.

962
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,240
Uncle Satay is here
to watch you appear on TV.

963
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,800
Auntie Otah, come! Quick!

964
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,000
Auntie Otah is here to support you.

965
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:06,439
There are seats over there.

966
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,600
Great.

967
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,560
Everyone's here. Starting soon.

968
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,920
Plenty of space over there.
Make yourself comfortable.

969
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,960
They are all here to support you.

970
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:38,640
I'm going to appear soon. I'm the nurse.

971
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,200
<i>Call yourself a man?
You're worse than a beast!</i>

972
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:47,200
<i>Grandma, please forgive me.</i>

973
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,640
<i>Sir, please don't be like this!</i>

974
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,640
<i>I swear I'll always come and visit you.</i>

975
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,760
<i>Grandma, please don't die, Grandma!</i>

976
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,280
<i>Grandma, are you all right?</i>

977
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,280
<i>Doctor!</i>

978
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,640
Show's over!

979
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,640
The credits have started.

980
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,240
Where was she?
Even the voice sounded different.

981
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,280
Not even a shadow! Zero!

982
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,440
Nothing at all! I knew it was impossible!

983
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,080
Should have bet with you!

984
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,080
It was just the shoulder,
might have been a body double.

985
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,680
Extras have body doubles, too?

986
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,760
Body double or not, it's time to pay up!

987
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,760
Yes! Pay up!

988
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,400
Well, you guys saw the shoulder, right?

989
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,560
We didn't bet
whether we would see the face.

990
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,600
Don't cheat! Pay up!

991
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:35,560
We saw the body, didn't we?
That's how I bet!

992
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,640
You guys got to pay up!
No cheating now, we saw the shoulder!

993
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,720
I gave birth to Ah Kiao!
I would know her shoulder!

994
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,600
Is this Director Boris?

995
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,640
How are you? I'm Zann.

996
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,480
Zann, not Fann. Zann!

997
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,800
No, I acted in your <i>Our Hospital</i>.
I played the nurse.

998
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,720
Yes, the nurse.

999
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,240
You gave me a close-up, remember?
And you said you have a lead role for me.

1000
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,320
Hello? Hello?

1001
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,120
Grandma, I will redeem it.

1002
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,720
What kind of joke is this?

1003
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,760
This is not even worth a dollar.

1004
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,440
What a waste of my time!

1005
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,560
What's going on?

1006
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,280
I want to watch Thomas Ong!

1007
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,600
That's my story.

1008
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,680
Sometimes, I really feel like giving up.

1009
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,640
Go back to my hometown
to sell televisions,

1010
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,080
or help my brother sell DVDs.

1011
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,200
But whenever I think of my grandma,

1012
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,960
I know in my heart
that she'd want me to stay.

1013
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,480
Do you want another cup? I'll go make it.

1014
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,800
No, thanks.

1015
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,160
I think I'd better go. I'm afraid
the landlord will lock the door.

1016
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,560
Don't you have the key?

1017
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,320
He doesn't let me have it.
He's afraid that I'll lose it.

1018
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,680
But it's okay, the rent is cheap.

1019
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,600
Anyway, I've got nowhere to go at night.

1020
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,200
The only thing I don't like
is that there's no TV at his place.

1021
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,680
No wonder you're always here
the whole day, to watch TV

1022
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,240
and you only order one cup of coffee.

1023
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:13,600
The boss says if everyone was like you,
we'd close down in no time.

1024
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,280
Next time I'll order two cups?

1025
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,480
I'm only joking with you.

1026
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,160
Who are you?

1027
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,560
I'm Christopher. Do you have amnesia?

1028
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:42,000
No, what I meant was,
your accent is obviously Taiwanese.

1029
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,960
Why would you be working here
as a coffee boy?

1030
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,480
Can't Taiwanese be coffee boys?

1031
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,400
No, they can only be stars,
singers and hosts!

1032
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,240
Hey, I love watching that program
<i>100% Entertainment.</i>

1033
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,720
I love that, too.

1034
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,560
I especially love Show Lo.
I think he's very handsome.

1035
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,080
I think so, too.

1036
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,040
I'm just like you,
crossing the ocean to be here.

1037
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,680
I took the bus,

1038
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,480
but I guess it's considered
crossing the ocean, too,

1039
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,840
since I crossed the causeway.

1040
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,640
Right.

1041
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,080
But the difference is
you're chasing your dreams.

1042
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,960
I'm chasing after my love.

1043
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,000
So, have you gotten your love?

1044
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,600
Is she Singaporean?

1045
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,400
Is it a guy or a girl?

1046
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,560
Guess.

1047
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,080
You said you liked Show Lo,
so it must be a guy.

1048
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,560
Bingo!

1049
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,240
- So, do I get a free cup of coffee?
- No.

1050
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,760
She went to school in Taiwan.
We were very much in love.

1051
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,720
So when she came back to Singapore,

1052
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,640
I decided to give up everything
and follow her here.

1053
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,640
But her dad was against us being together.

1054
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:08,720
He's a coffee tycoon, and he feels
I'm not worthy of his daughter.

1055
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:13,120
Your story is just like my grandma's.

1056
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,480
Your grandma fell in love with
a coffee tycoon's daughter, too?

1057
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:18,720
Of course not.

1058
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,640
What I meant was
your story's as dramatic as my grandma's.

1059
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,800
My grandma's ex-boyfriend was a superstar.

1060
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,600
But her mother
was also against them being together

1061
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,120
because she said
that all actors are heartless.

1062
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:41,720
Hey, how come you never mention your dad?

1063
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,240
Well, my mom said

1064
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:48,600
he left one day to look for a job
in Singapore and never came back.

1065
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,680
My mom also said,
even though he's not an actor,

1066
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,680
he's equally heartless.

1067
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,680
Actually, she said, all men are heartless.

1068
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,720
What a sweeping statement.

1069
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,080
How can your mom generalize like that?

1070
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,600
Do you have a boyfriend?

1071
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,120
Let me tell you a secret.

1072
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,440
I've never had a boyfriend in my life.

1073
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,920
Liar!

1074
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,160
It's true. And you haven't even told me.

1075
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,880
Told you what?

1076
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,760
What you're doing here making coffee.

1077
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,240
Don't tell me your girlfriend's daddy
owns this coffee shop.

1078
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,160
Of course not.

1079
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,720
I told myself that I would one day
take over his coffee empire.

1080
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,960
I'm going to be a coffee king.
I must know everything about coffee.

1081
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,080
That's why I'm starting from the bottom.

1082
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:59,720
I told myself, one day, I will make
the world's best cup of coffee.

1083
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,560
I think you would probably
have to make a million cups.

1084
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,920
Of course.

1085
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,680
Where there's a will, there's a way.

1086
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,080
Nobody becomes already famous overnight.

1087
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,120
It takes determination and perseverance
to even become almost famous.

1088
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,160
Don't you agree?

1089
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,640
Here's your Gong Cha, "Already Famous!"

1090
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,480
Really?

1091
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,000
I've never seen anyone who loves
watching movies as much as you do.

1092
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,880
Quick, go before the manager comes back.

1093
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,160
Thank you.

1094
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,720
Uncle, it's your favorite bubble tea.

1095
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,520
It's called "Already Famous."
It's got white pearls.

1096
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,640
That's great. Thank you.

1097
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,560
You're giving me a gold class seat today?

1098
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,640
Sure. Nobody watches
this kind of movie anyway.

1099
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,800
Go in quickly.

1100
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,280
Zann!

1101
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,040
Zann!

1102
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,640
Zann!

1103
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,640
Ah Kiao!

1104
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

1105
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,640
Watching the movie all by yourself?

1106
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,680
You, too?

1107
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,560
- Today's the last screening.
- Today's the last screening.

1108
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,680
You haven't come to the coffee shop
in a long time.

1109
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,680
I've been quite busy lately.

1110
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,640
What about later? I'll buy you dinner.

1111
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,640
I can't, I'm still working.

1112
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,720
I'm selling bubble tea, over there.
I sneaked out to watch this movie.

1113
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,720
What time are you working till?

1114
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,720
Should be quite late.

1115
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,360
We have to wait
for the midnight show to end.

1116
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,520
What about tomorrow night?

1117
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,720
I'm filming tomorrow night.

1118
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,560
We are shooting the Singapore version of
<i>Night Market Life.</i>

1119
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,600
Since it's "night" market life,
we can only film at night,

1120
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,720
so we'll probably film till quite late.

1121
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,720
Don't you have to work
at the coffee shop tomorrow?

1122
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,640
Yes.

1123
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:53,000
In that case, why don't you come to the
coffee shop after your filming tomorrow?

1124
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,200
I'll treat you to supper.

1125
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,640
All right then.

1126
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,480
I'll make a move first.

1127
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,160
Do you want "Already Famous"? It's free.

1128
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,160
What's that?

1129
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,520
Bubble tea.

1130
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,000
No, thanks.

1131
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,960
All right then.

1132
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

1133
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,120
Hot!

1134
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,120
I borrowed this dress
from the wardrobe department.

1135
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,040
I acted as a bar girl today.

1136
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,720
Bar girls these days are so fashionable.

1137
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,600
Wow, this is like a film set.

1138
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,320
Have a seat.

1139
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,520
What a spread!

1140
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,560
I bought it from the coffee shop
across the street.

1141
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,440
We don't sell Western food here.

1142
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,240
Cheers!

1143
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,200
Cheers!

1144
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,920
Can I eat now?

1145
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,360
I'm starving.

1146
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,840
Aren't you going to eat?

1147
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,480
So...

1148
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,840
Are you still...

1149
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,720
Do you still...

1150
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,560
How did you know what I was going to ask?

1151
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,240
I forgot to mention it the other day.

1152
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,280
My ex-girlfriend is already married.

1153
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,720
Really?

1154
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,160
So what are you doing
still working in this coffee shop?

1155
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,800
I might not be chasing love,
but I'm still chasing my dreams.

1156
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,800
I've never given up on
making the world's best cup of coffee.

1157
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,280
We can't be "hot for three minutes"
towards any work,

1158
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,760
and that includes coffee making.

1159
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,720
Coffee can't be hot
for just three minutes.

1160
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,520
At least ten minutes, right?

1161
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,720
I have something for you.

1162
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,200
BLESSINGS

1163
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,200
I can't accept this.

1164
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,600
Why not?

1165
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,520
This can't replace
your grandmother's "longevity,"

1166
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:02,160
but what's the use of having a long life
with no blessings?

1167
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,600
Hey, maybe these "blessings"

1168
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,040
will make it easier
for you to pursue your dreams.

1169
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,960
More luck, less hardship.

1170
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,400
I just hope you will be able
to achieve your dreams sooner.

1171
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:24,600
I better put it on now then.
I want to achieve my dreams sooner.

1172
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,680
How do I look?

1173
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,720
It matches your dress.

1174
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,680
I spent a long time looking for it.
The boss said it's an antique, too.

1175
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,960
This is an antique, too?

1176
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,040
Yes. The longer you wear it,
the greener it gets.

1177
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,560
- Really?
- Yes.

1178
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,920
My face's going to turn green then.

1179
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,240
You won't, you look great.

1180
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,520
Hello?

1181
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,640
Let me tell you, I was acting with Edmund
in a restaurant that day.

1182
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,560
There were two extras
who just kept on eating from the buffet.

1183
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,640
The director was so angry.

1184
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,200
Let me ask you, if there was fish
and some slices of cucumber on a platter,

1185
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,560
- what would you eat?
- Cucumber.

1186
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,560
Why?

1187
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,720
- Cucumber is cheaper?
- No.

1188
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,640
If you were to eat the fish,
there would be no continuity.

1189
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,640
Do you know continuity? I doubt you do.

1190
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,200
And we were already overrunning.

1191
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,280
The director and the AP were so stressed.

1192
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:34,080
So when Ah Gek arrived,
we had to go out and buy another fish.

1193
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,640
Is that professional of an extra? Is it?

1194
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,640
Who is Ah Gek?

1195
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,640
Ah Gek is Zoe Tay. You didn't know that?

1196
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,680
The executive producer is here!

1197
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,000
No more talking!

1198
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,760
- EP.
- Hello, EP.

1199
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:51,120
You're Zann, right?

1200
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,560
Do you recognize me? I remember you.

1201
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,280
I told you to call me the other time.
Why didn't you?

1202
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,240
What a shame.
The lead role went to another actress.

1203
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,720
Hello, EP. I'm Angie. You remember me?

1204
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,720
I acted in your <i>The Price Of Peace.</i>

1205
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,680
My husband was tortured to death
by the Japanese.

1206
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,320
Angie. The one who died a tragic death.
You've acted for a very long time.

1207
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,360
I joined this industry
the same time as Terence.

1208
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,720
Same time as Terence?

1209
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,320
You've been in this line
for a very long time indeed.

1210
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,560
I've just the show for you.

1211
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,640
What show?
I've acted in countless drama serials.

1212
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,000
The APs always contact me directly.

1213
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,320
It's not a drama serial.
It's a variety program.

1214
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,600
It's a national talent search.

1215
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,760
It's going to be phenomenal.
You guys will become famous.

1216
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,520
<i>Starz Search</i>. I've taken part five times,

1217
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,200
but last year,
they said I was over the age limit.

1218
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,560
It's not <i>Starz Search.</i>

1219
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,720
Anyway, just go to the
variety department tomorrow to audition.

1220
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,640
Tell them that it was Boris
who recommended you.

1221
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,240
Your chances will be higher.

1222
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,440
Who knows?
You might be the stars of tomorrow.

1223
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,320
You are not lying to me again, are you?

1224
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,640
Why should I lie to you?
Will I win the lottery if I do?

1225
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,520
Anyway, when you become famous,
you will thank me for it.

1226
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,600
Here's the form.

1227
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,600
Next scene!

1228
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,720
Ping Hui, what happened to your hair?
There's no continuity.

1229
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,480
KING OF THE EXTRAS

1230
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:15,720
Good morning! I'm sure you recognize
the famous Best Actress, Cynthia Koh.

1231
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,720
And he is Bryan Wong,
winner of the Best Host Award.

1232
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,680
And also the Best Infotainment Host Award.
Twice.

1233
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,720
My name is Lim Poh Huat. I'm 47 years old.

1234
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,240
CYNTHIA KOH - BRYAN WONG

1235
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,560
Many people think
it's easy being an extra,

1236
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,160
but that's just a misconception.

1237
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,600
Not only do extras
need to support the scene,

1238
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:34,640
they can't steal the limelight
from the lead actors.

1239
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,640
That's right.

1240
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,520
But for some lead actors,

1241
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,240
it's not difficult
to steal their limelight.

1242
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,760
Okay, let me give you the scenario.

1243
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:49,560
You're standing by the road
and you just witnessed a car accident.

1244
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,720
There's a body on the road.

1245
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,680
What's your reaction?

1246
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,160
You gotta think. Ready?

1247
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,160
Action!

1248
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,440
Action!

1249
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,840
Someone is dead.

1250
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,480
You guys go away, I need to save him.

1251
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,920
Hi, Sis Cynthia! Hi, Bro Bryan!

1252
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,400
She's calling the police.

1253
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,600
Who are you actually calling?

1254
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,840
You only need to dial three digits
to call the police.

1255
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,120
Why are you pressing so many buttons?

1256
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,760
I'm not calling the police.
I'm buying lottery tickets.

1257
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,720
I'm keying in the different permutations.

1258
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,600
My name is Lee Kar Kiao, Zann.

1259
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,760
I'm from Yong Peng, Malaysia.

1260
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,160
Three, two, one, action!

1261
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,640
That's not bad.

1262
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,720
I sense some emotions.

1263
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:17,880
Could you elaborate on what
was going through your mind just now?

1264
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:24,400
I might not know the deceased,
but I can imagine...

1265
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,000
when he was crossing the road,
he was probably rushing home for dinner.

1266
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,360
But now that he is gone,

1267
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,920
he will never have to chance to go home

1268
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,360
and have dinner
with his family ever again.

1269
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,760
I felt that, did you?

1270
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,600
Okay, you are...

1271
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,520
- Very good.
- Very good.

1272
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,440
Thank you.

1273
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,720
TOP 16 FINALISTS

1274
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,240
TOP 8 FINALISTS

1275
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,080
"Grandmother, please don't blame Ah Tao.
It wasn't her who stole it."

1276
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,080
KING OF THE EXTRAS

1277
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,080
Stole it.

1278
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,520
Want some coffee?

1279
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,240
Stole it. Stole it.

1280
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,760
Please don't blame Ah Tao.

1281
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:27,760
It wasn't her who stole it.

1282
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,760
That's so exaggerated!

1283
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:32,880
Can you lower the volume?

1284
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,880
I'm memorizing the lines
for the competition.

1285
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,960
But this is your favorite show.

1286
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,080
But tomorrow's the finals.

1287
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,560
It wasn't easy for me to get this far.

1288
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,680
I have to keep practicing
until it's perfect.

1289
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,040
There has to be no cuts and no "no goods."

1290
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,720
Most importantly, I have to practice
until my Malaysian accent is gone.

1291
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,760
Stole it, not stole it. Stole...

1292
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,800
But I love your Malaysian accent.

1293
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,520
Nothing.

1294
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,640
It's really loud.

1295
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:12,760
Why don't you go watch over there?
It's distracting.

1296
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,800
- I'll go make coffee.
- "She stole it.

1297
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,480
You can blame me for it!

1298
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:37,080
Grandmother, please don't blame Ah Tao.
It wasn't her who stole it."

1299
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,640
Good evening, everyone. I'm Lee Teng.

1300
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,680
Hello! I'm Pornsak.

1301
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,600
Welcome to <i>King of the Extras.</i>

1302
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,560
Our finalists have been chosen
from thousands of contestants

1303
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,560
for the chance to stand
on this stage tonight.

1304
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,640
Let's welcome them!

1305
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,680
Another round of applause!

1306
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:11,960
Hey, look!

1307
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,720
It's that village girl!
She's in the finals!

1308
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,520
She's looking good!

1309
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,800
Must be Pure Beauty!

1310
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,320
Angie, what's been
your most challenging role?

1311
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,520
My most challenging role
was a bomb blast victim.

1312
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,120
Have you ever acted
being killed by a bomb?

1313
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,640
- No.
- What about you?

1314
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,680
- No.
- Never, right? Let me demonstrate for you.

1315
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,960
Hold the mic for me.

1316
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,680
And we still have to shake like this.

1317
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,560
Let's welcome the next finalist, Sly!

1318
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,640
Sylvester Sim!

1319
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,280
Let me tell you...

1320
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,720
What a poser.

1321
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,720
Sly's really something.

1322
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,680
He was first runner-up
in <i>Singapore Idol</i> 2004.

1323
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,560
He was a household name.

1324
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,680
That's right. He was really popular.

1325
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,200
- Yes.
- So what's he doing here today?

1326
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,240
Hey! Bro David?

1327
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,600
If you were to win today,

1328
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,920
what kind of sacrifices
would you make for your career?

1329
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,320
Plastic surgery.

1330
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,640
In fact, I've already done it.

1331
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,320
Because I believe I have to present
my best side to the audience,

1332
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,800
if being on stage
is the path that I've chosen.

1333
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,120
Fake beauty is still beauty.

1334
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,680
Very good. That's the right attitude.

1335
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,560
You were once already famous.

1336
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,000
I believe you will become
even more famous.

1337
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:41,560
Let's welcome Zann on stage
for the interview.

1338
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,120
She's the hot favorite tonight.

1339
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,400
All right, Auntie Kiasu!

1340
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,760
If you have a choice,

1341
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:57,720
which local artiste
would you choose to act with?

1342
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,600
If I have a choice,

1343
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:06,680
I will choose to work with
a local artiste from Malaysia.

1344
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,000
Like Christopher Lee,

1345
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,440
Chen Hanwei,

1346
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,640
Zhang Yaodong,

1347
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,720
Apple Hong,

1348
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,760
Jesseca Liu and...

1349
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:19,960
I think we know
what you are trying to say, but why?

1350
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:26,120
If I were to act with them,
there would be a sense of familiarity.

1351
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,680
I would be more at ease.

1352
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:32,800
They say when one's comfortable,
one's acting will be more natural.

1353
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,640
But most importantly,

1354
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:39,120
they wouldn't laugh
at my Malaysian accent.

1355
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,720
Well done!

1356
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:44,000
What a good answer.

1357
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:47,280
How eloquent. If I had known sooner,
I wouldn't have cast you as a nurse.

1358
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,280
I would have sent you directly
to Jack Neo.

1359
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:54,560
Everybody knows that an extra
has to take on many roles.

1360
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,160
Even acting as a corpse
needs to be realistic.

1361
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,280
What's the most important thing
when acting as a dead person?

1362
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,560
You can't breathe.

1363
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:04,040
If you have a heaving chest,
you'll give the game away.

1364
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:07,800
Hey, <i>Singapore Idol,</i> don't lose face!

1365
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,400
His challenge is,
hold your breath for 30 seconds!

1366
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:21,760
Sly, we used to go fishing for mudfish
when we were young.

1367
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:25,280
Fish, my foot. Sly was so close to you.

1368
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,080
Where were you
when he needed you the most?

1369
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,280
Sly? Are you all right?

1370
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,800
Sly, wake up!

1371
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,640
That was less than five seconds.
What were you thinking?

1372
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,640
I just had a nose job.

1373
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,640
Look, my nostrils are so small.

1374
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:42,880
How to hold my breath?

1375
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,240
Boy, that was quick.

1376
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,240
Let's welcome our next finalist, Zann.

1377
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,640
Zann, do you still remember?

1378
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,560
When we were little,
we used to climb trees together.

1379
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,840
Climb, my foot. Zann was so good to you.

1380
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,320
Where were you
when she needed you the most?

1381
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,440
It's getting exciting.
Can Zann beat Sly's record?

1382
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,080
Not even ten seconds and she's up?

1383
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,600
What a pity. It was less than ten seconds.

1384
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,520
Must be nerves.

1385
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,560
What a shame. There are so many
people supporting her tonight.

1386
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,040
She's the hot favorite after all.

1387
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,000
Is it really that difficult
to hold one's breath?

1388
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,560
Let's find out
from our next finalist, Angie!

1389
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:37,640
Angie, do you remember?

1390
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:40,200
When we were little,
we used to fly kites together.

1391
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,720
Fly, my foot. Angie was so good to you.

1392
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,720
Where were you
when she needed you the most?

1393
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,720
Haven't you said enough?

1394
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,600
Angie? Are you all right?

1395
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,720
Angie! Quick, call the doctor!

1396
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,760
- Look at her great performance.
- She's not even moving a fingernail.

1397
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:02,240
Counting down! Ten, nine, eight,

1398
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,600
seven, six, five, four,

1399
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,800
three, two, one!

1400
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:08,720
Congratulations! You did it!

1401
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,880
Well done!

1402
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,800
I held my breath for so long,
I thought I was really going to die.

1403
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:19,600
Angie is really a pro at acting.
No wonder she is the master of extras.

1404
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,680
Absolutely. She must have played a corpse
many times in her acting career.

1405
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,040
Of course.

1406
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,120
Right now, Angie is leading.

1407
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:29,520
But can Zann catch up in the last round?

1408
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,320
We'll find out after the break!

1409
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,520
Zann! I was so nervous!

1410
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,720
My face was itching.
I was dying to scratch it.

1411
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,720
Luckily, I resisted.

1412
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,680
Are you okay?

1413
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,080
Everyone's bound to be nervous,

1414
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,640
but I told myself,

1415
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,560
winning this competition
would be like winning the lottery.

1416
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,640
I've already won the consolation prize.

1417
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,640
So don't worry so much, okay?

1418
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:58,760
I need to go touch up my hair.

1419
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:01,000
Lying down
for so long messed it up a little.

1420
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:04,640
Angie, can you please lend me your phone?

1421
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,960
It's in my bag. Help yourself, okay?

1422
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,280
Hey, I heard that finalist
is your girlfriend.

1423
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,560
So lucky.

1424
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:14,920
She's pretty.

1425
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,720
Stop teasing me, you guys.

1426
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,000
<i>Hello?</i>

1427
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,920
It's me.

1428
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,680
Zann, how come you can use the phone?

1429
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:30,680
You were great!
Everyone here says you look beautiful!

1430
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:38,280
Hello?

1431
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:49,600
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1432
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:54,640
<i>Is it nerves? Just relax.</i>

1433
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,320
I'm sure to lose.

1434
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,680
Isn't there a final round?

1435
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:13,160
It's useless. I won't win.

1436
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:19,200
The game's not over yet
and you're already giving up?

1437
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,760
That's not the Zann I know.

1438
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,080
<i>I'm not even Zann.</i>

1439
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,200
I'm just Ah Kiao from Yong Peng.

1440
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:31,480
I only know how to sell televisions.
I don't know how to be on television.

1441
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:40,080
Don't put yourself under so much pressure.
It's only a competition.

1442
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,640
You don't understand.

1443
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,600
This isn't just a competition.

1444
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,280
If I lose, I will have nothing left.

1445
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:54,480
I will have to go back
to selling televisions.

1446
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:01,080
Mom will be devastated,
and even lose money.

1447
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,720
My brother will be disappointed...

1448
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,800
and the whole village will laugh at me.

1449
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:13,000
There's no shame in losing.
At least you did your best.

1450
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:16,520
Everybody knows that, especially me.

1451
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:20,560
<i>Losing this competition doesn't mean
that you will lose at everything else.</i>

1452
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,560
<i>How many people can be like you?</i>

1453
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:27,160
You're Ah Kiao from Yong Peng,
yet you managed to be on national TV.

1454
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,640
Not everyone can make it
on his or her first shot.

1455
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:36,760
<i>And not everyone can last till the end.</i>

1456
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,160
<i>To me,</i>

1457
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,120
you've already won.

1458
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:50,800
If they don't give you
the female lead, I will.

1459
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,600
If you don't mind...

1460
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,680
you can be the leading lady in my life.

1461
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:07,080
You can always "no good" and try again...

1462
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,840
but no one will ever shout "cut."

1463
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:34,640
Welcome back to <i>King of Extras.</i>
It's our final round.

1464
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,560
That's right, in this critical round,

1465
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:39,520
we are going to test
the finalists' crying skills.

1466
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:43,640
The one who can shed a tear
within a minute will be our winner.

1467
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,720
Remember, the winner gets a

1468
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:48,720
ten-year, full-time artiste contract
with the TV station.

1469
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,760
A ten-year contract with the TV station?

1470
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,480
The mere thought of it
makes me want to weep.

1471
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,640
<i>Tears of joy of course.</i>

1472
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,680
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

1473
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,680
<i>Let's welcome our first finalist, Angie.</i>

1474
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,560
Angie, even though you're leading,

1475
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:09,640
if you don't cry on cue and Zann does,
Zann will be the winner.

1476
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,240
But if you do,
the ten-year contract will be yours.

1477
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:15,560
But if both you and Zann can't cry,
you're still our winner.

1478
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:16,600
Understand? You got it?

1479
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:21,760
Anyway, just try to cry.

1480
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:24,400
That means I've already won
at least the second prize.

1481
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,640
Glad that you finally got it.

1482
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,400
If you're ready,
we're going to start timing.

1483
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,080
Get set, go!

1484
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:07,760
- Time's up!
- Not a single tear.

1485
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,760
But no worries.

1486
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,200
Now's really the exciting time.

1487
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,680
If Zann cries on cue,
she'll be our champion.

1488
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,800
<i>But if Zann doesn't cry,
Angie will be our champion tonight.</i>

1489
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:20,720
<i>Hey, Zann.</i>

1490
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,240
<i>We heard from the drama producers
you can turn it on like a tap.</i>

1491
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,160
<i>I'm just okay.</i>

1492
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:28,640
But now you have to cry
under a lot of pressure.

1493
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:29,680
You think you can do it?

1494
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,680
I think she's ready.

1495
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,800
- You have one minute. Go.
- You go, girl.

1496
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:55,560
Grandma, this is David Gan.

1497
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,880
He's a hair stylist
for many celebrities in Singapore.

1498
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:03,040
<i>When you're young,
do what your heart desires.</i>

1499
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,800
<i>Don't think so much.</i>

1500
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:11,560
<i>What's the use of having a long life</i>

1501
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:17,960
if you don't get to do what you love?

1502
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:32,040
Why is she smiling?

1503
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:34,560
Hey, Zann, we need you to cry.

1504
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,640
Shed tears! Weep!

1505
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,640
Cry, not smile!

1506
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:41,040
If you don't cry, I'm going to cry soon.
What now?

1507
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,520
Cry, don't smile!

1508
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,720
Ah Kiao Sis, cry!

1509
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,320
Cry!

1510
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:48,560
Cry!

1511
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,200
Cry!

1512
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:52,000
Cry!

1513
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,720
Cry!

1514
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:01,320
<i>To me, you've already won.</i>

1515
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:07,600
<i>If they don't give you
the female lead, I will.</i>

1516
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:09,760
<i>If you don't mind...</i>

1517
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,720
<i>you can be the leading lady in my life.</i>

1518
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,640
<i>You can always "no good" and try again...</i>

1519
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,640
<i>but no one will ever shout "cut."</i>

1520
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:25,720
She did it!

1521
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:32,480
Congratulations, Zann! You're the
inaugural winner of <i>King of Extras.</i>

1522
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:34,760
She cried!

1523
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,160
She just won a ten-year contract
with the TV station!

1524
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,520
It's great to have you joining us!

1525
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,440
Once again, we want to congratulate Zann
for being the champion of <i>King of Extras!</i>

1526
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,000
She's awesome!

1527
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:00,760
We would like to invite David
to crown our new winner.

1528
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,760
and to hand her the trophy.

1529
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:05,680
Don't forget she also gets the coveted
ten-year contract with the TV station.

1530
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,080
<i>It makes me want to cry, too!</i>

1531
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,680
<i>What a touching moment!</i>

1532
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,960
What a joyous occasion!

1533
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,560
Welcome to our big, happy family!

1534
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,040
Congratulations, once again!

1535
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:48,720
Lee Kar Kiao! Stop watching television!

1536
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:54,320
Two cups of Kopi, two cups of tea!

1537
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:01,840
Crying again? Come to Mommy.

1538
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,720
She's looking for you.

1539
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,640
Daddy's naughty, let's beat him.

1540
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,200
Don't cry.

1541
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,280
BOOMING BUSINESS

1542
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:28,280
We can't be "hot for three minutes"
towards any work,

1543
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:30,160
and that includes coffee making.

1544
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,840
Three minutes...

1545
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,360
Screwed! Jammed.

1546
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,840
...and that includes coffee making.

1547
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,320
Come on.

1548
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:44,440
How can we as humans... Towards work...
Towards what?

1549
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,880
Coffee can't be hot
for just three minutes.

1550
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,200
At least ten minutes, right?

1551
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,080
Coffee...

1552
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:55,320
Why not? Although this can't replace
your grandmother's...

1553
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,960
From here, read it again.

1554
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,200
Well...

1555
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,440
I've loved your local productions
since I was little,

1556
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:13,320
like <i>Golden Pillow</i>,
<i>Little Flying Fish</i> and...

1557
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:17,040
<i>Golden Pillow, The Spring of Holland,
The Morning Express,</i>

1558
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:20,680
and <i>The Unbeatables</i>, <i>The Unbeatables II...</i>

1559
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:21,960
I feel dizzy.

1560
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:27,360
And I liked watching
<i>The Morning Express, </i>too,

1561
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:30,880
because the actor was Chan Hanwei...

1562
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:35,000
I love you more
than even Leticia Bongnino.

1563
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:37,000
Who is Bongnino?

1564
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:42,800
I would like to tell you about an artiste
who speaks funny, just like you.

1565
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,520
So, please call him.

1566
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,720
You think that's easy?

1567
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,680
Haven't you ever acted being shot?

1568
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,520
No, right?
Let me demonstrate for you.

1569
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,000
Hang on.

1570
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:09,280
One moment,
we need to jump a bit like this.

1571
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,360
I'm sorry, I cannot...

1572
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,280
The third contestant is remarkable.

1573
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,720
He's done Lin Zhiling's with Liu Jialing's

1574
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:22,960
and with Gong Li's hairstyle.
He's Liang...

1575
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,920
Liang Chaowei!

1576
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:33,520
- Don't stare at me. Eat and say, "Hmm."
- Hmm.

1577
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,560
Eat.

1578
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,840
Eat more.

1579
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,440
Smile a bit.

1580
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,160
A bit more.

1581
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:51,680
Okay, good, now to the end, okay?

1582
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,200
