Athena-1.
Athena-1, <i>come in.</i>

3
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:32,129
Athena-1, <i>this is Control. We have
negative copy on that last transmission.</i>

4
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:35,233
<i>We are showing LOS in the command module.
Please verify. Over.</i>

5
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:37,636
Mission Control,
this is Atkins.

6
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:39,638
Something went wrong
with the test.

7
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,672
The crew is dead.

8
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:44,040
<i>Athena</i> hull integrity
is critical.

9
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,076
I'm headed
to the escape capsule.

10
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,479
<i>Negative, negative.
Reroute to the lab and</i>

11
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:50,348
<i>secure the canisters
before departure.</i>

12
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,316
But the test subject is loose.

13
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:54,653
<i>Doctor, the test subject
is a rat.</i>

14
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:55,988
Not anymore.

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,528
What is this?

16
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,760
<i>You have your orders, Doctor.</i>

17
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:04,995
Open the goddamn door!

18
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:07,998
<i>Dr. Atkins, it's Claire Wyden.</i>

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,538
<i>We'll unlock the escape capsule
when you secure the samples.</i>

20
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,710
<i>Doctor, either you come home
with my research,</i>

21
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:21,515
<i>or you don't come home at all.</i>

22
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,276
Entering the lab.

23
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:57,384
Okay.

24
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:11,061
Mission Control, securing
the samples now.

25
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:12,166
<i>Copy that.</i>

26
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,180
<i>Warning,
hull integrity critical.</i>

27
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:36,757
Oh, God.

28
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:49,701
Open it!

29
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:51,305
<i>Capsule unlocked.</i>

30
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,601
Mmm. I love that smell.

31
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:32,035
Brings me right back to
Uganda.

32
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:33,237
You've been to Uganda?

33
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,905
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

34
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:37,307
If the jungle doesn't kill
you, the poachers will.

35
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:39,776
<i>The cops are still after me
from all that shit I pulled.</i>

36
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,613
<i>They call me</i> El Diablo.

37
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:42,747
I know they don't speak Spanish,
but they might as well.

38
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:44,482
Right.

39
00:05:44,484 --> 00:05:46,718
- You ever see <i>Blood Diamond?</i>
- Yeah.

40
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,285
Now, I know it's about diamonds,
but it really captures the vibe.

41
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,888
I don't know if it's the same region.
But, you know, it's intense.

42
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,492
<i>Don't mess with
Mother Africa...</i>

43
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,567
Everything okay, boss?

44
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,604
No, it's not.

45
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,304
Don't move a muscle.

46
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:10,273
Junior here is dropping
a lot of monkey shit

47
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,478
with these made-up stories.

48
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:18,485
It's very entertaining, though.
It's very entertaining.

49
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:22,252
I've been to Uganda, man.

50
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:24,688
And I've been to Hogwarts.

51
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,924
Regardless, if you had any
experience with poaching,

52
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:30,960
you would know that it's extremely rude
to talk about it in front of a lady.

53
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,598
Oh, it's okay.
I can handle it.

54
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,437
Oh, I know you can. I'm
talking about these ladies.

55
00:06:58,323 --> 00:06:59,857
There shouldn't be any
problems,

56
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,692
but remember you're not
in the classroom anymore.

57
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:04,828
These are wild animals.
They're very unpredictable.

58
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,833
So remember your training,
and do exactly as I say.

59
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,737
Tell me, what do you see?

60
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,507
The, uh, the young male,

61
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:21,744
is attempting to establish his
presence with the female.

62
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:24,683
<i>He's posturing, agitated.</i>

63
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,850
Sounds like someone we know,
right?

64
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:29,553
Okay, let's remember this is Paavo's
first interaction with the troop.

65
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,155
<i>So we'll just take it
nice and easy,</i>

66
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,894
and we'll see how well he
responds to my commands.

67
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:37,164
I...

68
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:45,706
Paavo.

69
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:49,073
Paavo. Paavo, it's okay.

70
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:50,944
Femi, Enu, on station.

71
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:54,444
<i>Good girls.</i>

72
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:57,217
Easy.

73
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,551
That's far enough, Paavo.

74
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:02,752
It's okay.
Calm. Calm.

75
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,256
It's me.

76
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:10,598
Calm.

77
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:13,463
<i>There you go.</i>

78
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:14,565
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

79
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:15,569
<i>Good boy.</i>

80
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:20,771
Good boy.

81
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:22,241
Good boy.

82
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:31,417
Uh... Davis.

83
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:40,823
Everyone stay where you are.
No one move.

84
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,926
Are you crazy?

85
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:43,961
If you move, we're gonna be in big trouble.
Connor, do not move.

86
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:46,099
Connor, do what he says.

87
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:48,232
<i>Paavo...</i>

88
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:50,136
Connor, don't move!

89
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,169
Paavo!

90
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,907
No! Paavo! Shit!

91
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,641
<i>Help! Help!</i>

92
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:08,686
Connor! Connor!

93
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:10,020
It's okay.

94
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:11,755
George! George!

95
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:13,691
George!

96
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:17,329
George!
Easy, buddy. Easy.

97
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,001
Okay. Okay.

98
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:27,539
Oh, very funny. Very funny.

99
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,674
<i>We're all very impressed.
Yes, yes.</i>

100
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:31,508
You and I, laughing at your
joke, okay?

101
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,446
New guy, he no laugh.

102
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,945
He cry.

103
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:39,049
<i>Yeah. Yeah, opposite of laugh.</i>

104
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:41,318
- Connor, you can get up now.
- Are you 100% on that?

105
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,720
100% sure. You can get up.

106
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,790
And check your diaper.
Come on, let's go.

107
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:47,059
He cry.

108
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:50,828
It's okay, it's okay.

109
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,795
He's not gonna kill me?

110
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:55,357
No, he's not gonna kill you. He
has a unique sense of humor. I...

111
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:00,671
Uh, no, no.

112
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:02,543
George no save Davis.

113
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,509
I don't need your saving. No.

114
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:07,144
George no save Davis.
You didn't save me.

115
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:09,680
I was fine on my own.
I'm fine.

116
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:13,320
Stop doing that. Listen, it's important
for you to be nice to Paavo.

117
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,821
<i>He's just a kid.</i>

118
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,027
Poachers killed his entire
family.

119
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,497
<i>He's in your troop now.</i>

120
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:27,231
<i>I want you to welcome him.</i>

121
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:28,935
Welcome Paavo.

122
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:38,077
George, you and I cool?

123
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,846
Come on.

124
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:49,755
Wow, I can't,
Come on.

125
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,624
I should never have taught you
that. Stop that.

126
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:55,059
Now, come on. Give me,

127
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:57,394
Come on! Don't do that.

128
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:00,430
Stop that! Okay.
All right, listen.

129
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,369
I need you to protect Paavo.

130
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,275
Family.

131
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:23,820
I started using this new
vegan deodorant.

132
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:26,122
- How's that?
- I smell like guacamole.

133
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,593
Hey! Davis.

134
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:29,793
Hey.

135
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:32,597
Hi. Look,
I just wanted to say,

136
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,931
that was amazing out there.

137
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,000
Ah, thank you.

138
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:39,969
And I would love to learn more
about those submission techniques.

139
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,941
If you have time for a drink?

140
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:45,342
Yes!

141
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:46,809
Your allergies acting up
again?

142
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:47,977
It's the dander.

143
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:49,580
- It's the dander.
- <i>Animal dander.</i>

144
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:51,115
Mmm-hmm. Uh...

145
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:52,517
Thank you, anyway.
I appreciate it.

146
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,851
I already have plans tonight.

147
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:54,852
You did great out there today.
Okay?

148
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:56,819
Oh, I didn't do anything.

149
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:58,488
Exactly. The first rule of
dealing with hostile animals is,

150
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,658
you wanna remain calm.

151
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,695
I was gonna bake some kale bread
tonight, if you're interested.

152
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:08,599
No, I know you have a gluten thing.
All right, see you in the morning.

153
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:11,101
She used the word
"submission." That's a clue.

154
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:13,303
Should I go back there and tell her your
plans are to hang out with your dogs?

155
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:16,708
Come on, you know me, Nelson.
I need my "me" time.

156
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,342
Your "me" time?

157
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:20,477
Okay. Listen, buddy,

158
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,591
since everyone else is afraid to
tell you this, of course I will.

159
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:23,717
It's, um...

160
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:26,651
Uh, what's the terminology?

161
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:29,657
Weird you like hanging out
with animals more than people.

162
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,488
They get me.

163
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,323
Animals like you, they lick you.
They don't like you, they eat you.

164
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,359
You always know where you
stand.

165
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:38,530
Or where you lie. All chewed up in
their belly 'cause they ate you.

166
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,030
Yeah, that's just some food for thought.
And by the way, you're the food.

167
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:43,232
All right, get outta here,
you big lug.

168
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:44,536
Say hi to the dogs for me.

169
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:45,905
I will.

170
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:55,181
Girls love him.

171
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:58,652
I should shave my head.

172
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:25,968
I got your message about
George. He okay?

173
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,104
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

174
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,341
Davis. Davis!

175
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,278
He's in the grizzly enclosure.

176
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:35,982
What?

177
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:52,831
Jesus.

178
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,610
- Put it down.
- What?

179
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:08,377
You know how he is around guns.
Put it down.

180
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,680
Are you sure?

181
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:11,884
Put it down.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

182
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:23,631
Hey, George?

183
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,165
It's okay.

184
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:28,033
It's me.

185
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:31,237
It's me.

186
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,345
What happened?

187
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:43,981
You're sad.

188
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:45,686
It's okay.

189
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,821
Did you hurt him?

190
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,057
"Sorry"?

191
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:55,193
It's okay.

192
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,169
Did he hurt you?

193
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,607
He made you scared.

194
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:09,942
It's okay.

195
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:12,444
It's...

196
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,848
George.

197
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:17,717
George.

198
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:20,550
It's okay to be scared.

199
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:22,788
It's okay.
Calm.

200
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:26,693
Easy.

201
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:39,570
Is it me or is he
considerably bigger?

202
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,905
No, he's definitely bigger.

203
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,641
<i>It's Connor.</i>

204
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:45,683
<i>Guys, you need to get over
to the gorilla enclosure.</i>

205
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,490
What the hell happened?

206
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:01,559
We were doing our morning
rounds when we saw the burnt foliage,

207
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,827
and found this.

208
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:05,330
All right, let me see the kit.

209
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:23,513
What is it?

210
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:26,785
I don't know.
But we gotta figure it out.

211
00:17:29,154 --> 00:17:31,821
<i>Stupid piece of crap!</i>

212
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:33,325
<i>Mini space station!</i>

213
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:37,263
Are you done?

214
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:41,464
We just lost billions of
dollars, Claire.

215
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:43,165
Tens of billions, actually.

216
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,269
Plus $20,000 for the models
you just destroyed.

217
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:48,174
Our stock got hammered this
morning.

218
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,173
Down 20%.

219
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:52,142
And you aren't upset,
because...

220
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:54,978
Because Project Rampage works.

221
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,481
- Do you know how much that's worth?
- Zero.

222
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,717
Because all of our research
was on that space station.

223
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,354
Actually,

224
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:06,557
Atkins got the research
samples onto the escape pod.

225
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,626
<i>Yes, the escape pod blew up.</i>

226
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:11,962
But the canisters were
engineered to withstand reentry.

227
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:14,564
And the American Meteor Society
just reported a meteor strike

228
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,165
in southern Wyoming.

229
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:20,203
All we have to do is go
get it back.

230
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,004
Well, let's get out there!

231
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:24,675
Somebody finds that sample,
it leads straight back to us.

232
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,876
Please, enough with the
overreacting.

233
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:28,678
I am not overreacting, Claire.

234
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,013
There's a reason we were doing
these experiments in space.

235
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:33,095
And it wasn't exactly for
the betterment of humanity.

236
00:18:33,652 --> 00:18:35,018
Okay.

237
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,886
Look,

238
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:38,522
you handle the press,

239
00:18:38,524 --> 00:18:40,691
and I'll get Burke to take
care of the canister.

240
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:42,659
Who is Burke?

241
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,662
Remember that private military
firm we acquired last year?

242
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:46,495
You called them "Killers
'R' Us."

243
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:48,898
Yeah?

244
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,036
Well, he's the "us."

245
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,625
Boss.

246
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:16,796
<i>Wheels up! You boys are
Oscar Mike.</i>

247
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:18,763
Let's do it.

248
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,107
<i>Where to, Burke?</i>

249
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,276
<i>Wyoming.</i>

250
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:34,743
<i>Ah, never been.</i>

251
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,812
<i>Lots of mountains,
not a lot of people.</i>

252
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:39,384
<i>Animals love it.
You'll fit right in.</i>

253
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:07,944
Shit.

254
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:09,980
Hey, Mark.

255
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:11,748
<i>Where the hell are you? Do you
have any idea what time it is?</i>

256
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,119
Yes, yes. Um...

257
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:15,452
Yeah, sorry.

258
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:17,956
I am on the freeway,

259
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:23,460
I know I've already been late
twice this week,

260
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:25,794
but it will not happen again.

261
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:28,431
<i>Brett Wyden addressed the
situation with this brief statement.</i>

262
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,668
<i>My sister and I and everyone at
Energyne are stunned and deeply saddened</i>

263
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,604
<i>by the loss of the</i> Athena-1
<i>crew.</i>

264
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:35,972
<i>These were brave and brilliant
men and women of science,</i>

265
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:38,040
<i>who were committed to helping
mankind,</i>

266
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:40,010
<i>and we will continue that work
in their honor.</i>

267
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:41,211
<i>That's enough.
Thank you.</i>

268
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:44,880
Helping mankind, my ass.

269
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:48,818
<i>Since then, Wall Street has kept a
close eye on Energyne's performance.</i>

270
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,186
<i>Now to politics...</i>

271
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:53,557
<i>What you're looking at is
dramatic video of a fireball</i>

272
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,492
<i>touching down near the San
Diego Wildlife Sanctuary.</i>

273
00:20:56,494 --> 00:21:00,163
<i>It is thought to be debris from
last night's</i> Athena-1 <i>tragedy.</i>

274
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:01,897
<i>However, it's unclear
if this is related</i>

275
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:04,300
<i>to one of the park's gorillas
escaping the enclosure</i>

276
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:05,734
<i>at the sanctuary earlier
this morning.</i>

277
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,470
<i>The gorilla's name is
George...</i>

278
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:10,473
Hold on a second, Mark.
The car ahead of me...

279
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:13,175
- It just exploded.
- <i>What?</i>

280
00:21:13,177 --> 00:21:16,146
<i>There is currently no explanation
for the primate's behavior,</i>

281
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:18,549
<i>and zoo officials are not
commenting at this time.</i>

282
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:21,751
<i>Our very own Jason Sloss is at
the scene. Jason, what have you heard?</i>

283
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:23,386
<i>That's right,
Chris and Maria.</i>

284
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:24,854
<i>I'm here at the San Diego
Wildlife Sanctuary,</i>

285
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:26,589
<i>and the word
everyone seems to be using</i>

286
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,696
<i>to describe the gorilla's
escape is "surprising."</i>

287
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:43,577
<i>There. Set her down.</i>

288
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:11,467
<i>We've secured the canister, but
it was pretty badly damaged.</i>

289
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:14,104
<i>Whatever was in it
was destroyed.</i>

290
00:22:14,106 --> 00:22:15,241
<i>There's something else.</i>

291
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:18,742
<i>These wolves were slaughtered.</i>

292
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:22,545
<i>From the tracks, looks like
another one killed the pack.</i>

293
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:24,215
It's infected with the
pathogen.

294
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:29,418
Burke, I need that wolf.
Dead or alive.

295
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,222
<i>Copy that.</i>

296
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,929
This is the list of the unrecognized
hybrids you were talking about.

297
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:42,666
George's lab results are in.

298
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:44,336
You're not gonna like 'em.

299
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,271
This can't be right.

300
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:51,575
His neuromuscular synapse
activity is through the roof,

301
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:55,310
his blood has lethal
concentrations of growth hormone,

302
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:56,780
he'd be dead.

303
00:22:56,782 --> 00:22:57,946
Run it again.

304
00:22:57,948 --> 00:22:59,617
I did.

305
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,418
I ran it three times.
His values went up each time.

306
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,087
We can't keep this quiet.

307
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:05,989
Animal Response is
asking questions.

308
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:07,625
I just dodged a call. It was
someone from the government.

309
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,091
What do you want me to tell
people?

310
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,926
Tell them nothing.

311
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:12,194
He didn't do it, Nelson.

312
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:13,664
Look at him.
Somebody did that to him.

313
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,832
Davis, he killed
a grizzly bear.

314
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,101
Okay? Snapped his neck
like it was a toothpick.

315
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:21,937
Listen, protocol says, first sign of
aggression mandates immediate isolation.

316
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:23,173
It's what we're doing.

317
00:23:23,175 --> 00:23:25,474
This is beyond protocol.

318
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:27,711
Davis, look at him.

319
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:29,982
- I'm looking at him.
- Really look at him!

320
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:34,987
That is not the George we know.

321
00:23:38,857 --> 00:23:40,726
If we report this,
they're gonna put him down.

322
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:45,398
I can't let that happen.

323
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:54,236
I'll keep everyone off your
back as long as I can.

324
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:55,407
All right.

325
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:57,342
Thank you.

326
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,096
I'm gonna figure this out,
George.

327
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:22,501
I promise.

328
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:29,338
All right, everybody,
listen up.

329
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,774
I need to find someone who knows
exactly what the hell this thing is.

330
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:34,277
I found her!

331
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,279
No, that's a lie.
Technically, she found us.

332
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,414
You must be Davis Okoye.

333
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,916
Thank you so much for
your help.

334
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:42,619
What help?

335
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:45,120
I'm Kate Caldwell. I'm a
geneticist with Energyne.

336
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:47,790
Um, you recovered
my research sample.

337
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,893
Yeah, you mean this?

338
00:24:49,895 --> 00:24:53,029
Oh, please tell me you had that
tested for residual particulates.

339
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:55,397
Yes, that's exactly what I did.
I always do that.

340
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:56,965
Anytime something
new comes in.

341
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:58,902
Amy, have this tested
for residual particulates.

342
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:00,369
I need that back.

343
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:02,805
Actually, I need some
questions answered.

344
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:05,608
Like what the hell is that
thing doing to my friend?

345
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,412
Uh, well, I am not allowed
to discuss that with you.

346
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:11,880
Oh. Okay, well,

347
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:13,883
I guess we can't help each
other then.

348
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:16,051
Kate Caldwell, it was good to meet you.
Nelson, show her out.

349
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:17,388
He's growing, isn't he?

350
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:21,390
At an unprecedented rate,
right?

351
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:25,427
Increased strength, speed,
agility.

352
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:29,167
Demonstrating levels of aggression
you don't see in his species.

353
00:25:32,504 --> 00:25:34,005
Come with me.

354
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,744
Last night, he was seven feet,
500 pounds.

355
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:45,518
This morning, he was almost
nine feet, pushing 1,000.

356
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:48,784
His hair?

357
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:50,752
Yeah, he's an albino.

358
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:53,074
As far as I know, he's the only
living gorilla of his kind.

359
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,760
He can sign?

360
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:59,162
Yeah, he can sign
and he's hungry.

361
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:00,762
Guys, let's get George
something to eat.

362
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:02,935
It's okay.
There you go, buddy.

363
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:05,835
It makes sense.

364
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:07,169
He must be starving.

365
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:09,105
He's growing so rapidly.

366
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:10,640
"Makes sense"?

367
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:12,341
Last night, he killed
a grizzly bear.

368
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:14,277
The most powerful terrestrial
predator on the planet.

369
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,812
So you tell me right now, Kate,
how any of this makes sense.

370
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:18,648
Are you familiar with CRISPR?

371
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,949
Yeah, genetic engineering.

372
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:21,618
It's more like
genetic editing.

373
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,621
I am talking about
extremely specific results.

374
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:26,321
Check this out.

375
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,825
Sharks are indeterminate
growers, right?

376
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,158
They never stop.

377
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,328
Isolate that gene
and combine it with, say,

378
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,329
the growth rate of a
blue whale,

379
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:36,165
the strength of a
rhinoceros beetle,

380
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,134
the speed of a cheetah,

381
00:26:38,136 --> 00:26:40,570
And you get one confused gorilla
that could take down a grizzly.

382
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:43,506
We developed a lot of different
genetic combinations,

383
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:46,908
so changes will be incredibly
unpredictable.

384
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,877
<i>Right. Okay,
Kate, I get all that,</i>

385
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:51,047
but it still doesn't explain
to me how he doubled in size.

386
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,749
Guys, we need to get that
food in now.

387
00:26:52,751 --> 00:26:55,251
See, CRISPR only allows
you to alter

388
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:57,553
the DNA of one cell at a time.

389
00:26:57,555 --> 00:26:59,723
But I developed a system

390
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:04,926
which rapidly transmits changes to every
strand of DNA in the host's body.

391
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:07,062
Mr. Okoye, listen to me.

392
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:10,366
I am the only one
who can cure him.

393
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:13,738
George!

394
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:18,877
George! No!

395
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,086
It's not gonna hold.

396
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:28,753
Kate!

397
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:34,459
Everybody back!

398
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:46,138
Not again! Not again!

399
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,472
George!

400
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:52,107
George! Stop, George!

401
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,111
<i>Davis!</i>

402
00:27:54,812 --> 00:27:56,612
Shit.
Call 911!

403
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:57,915
Come on!

404
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,450
Look out!

405
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:21,002
George! George!

406
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:23,239
George, it's okay.
It's okay.

407
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:24,773
It's okay.

408
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:27,342
Yes, I know you're scared.
I'm gonna help you.

409
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:32,183
No, no, no.

410
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:35,484
No, it's okay.

411
00:28:35,486 --> 00:28:36,853
Sir, move away from the
animal!

412
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:38,589
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

413
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,156
I'm the primatologist here.
I look after this animal.

414
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:44,095
I can handle this situation. I just
need you to lower your weapons.

415
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:45,664
Please.

416
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,502
It's okay. Calm.

417
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:52,303
Good.

418
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:57,008
Stand down.

419
00:28:58,309 --> 00:28:59,445
Stand down.

420
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:03,114
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm gonna help you.

421
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:07,886
What the hell?

422
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:11,690
No!

423
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:17,530
George!

424
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:44,423
George!

425
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:46,390
George!

426
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:49,094
George!

427
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:02,905
<i>I've never hunted a wolf before.
What do you think, fellas?</i>

428
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:04,743
<i>Should I bring the .50 cal?</i>

429
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,113
<i>Got 'em.
Treeline.</i>

430
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:14,618
<i>You sure that's a wolf?
Damn, that thing is moving.</i>

431
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,120
<i>Not for long.</i>

432
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:35,606
<i>Burke to Base,</i>

433
00:30:35,608 --> 00:30:38,109
<i>Rampage-1 is down.</i>

434
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,647
What do you got?

435
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,449
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

436
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:22,286
Wait a second.

437
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:26,755
<i>We got tracks.</i>

438
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:28,292
<i>Are you seeing this?</i>

439
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:35,868
Jesus.

440
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,302
A wolf made that?

441
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:42,675
Maybe I should've
brought the .50 cal.

442
00:31:58,356 --> 00:31:59,658
Boss...

443
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,794
How we playing this?

444
00:32:05,796 --> 00:32:07,131
Nice and easy.

445
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:18,541
They're in a hurry.

446
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:19,678
What do you think spooked...

447
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:24,146
Vinny! Garrick!
Set a perimeter!

448
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:25,748
- Come on!
- Open fire!

449
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,684
<i>Get it! Get it!</i>

450
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:28,921
<i>Light him up!</i>

451
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,155
What the hell?

452
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,357
<i>Hit 'em! Hit 'em!</i>

453
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,326
<i>Run! Run!</i>

454
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:38,860
<i>Garrick, where are you?</i>

455
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:41,198
<i>- It's on me!
- Run, Garrick!</i>

456
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,933
Come on, get it!

457
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:45,267
<i>Taylor, get up!</i>

458
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:46,368
They won't.

459
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,936
<i>Taylor! Go!</i>

460
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:50,106
The pathogen is doing what
we designed it to.

461
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:51,909
<i>No! God damn it!</i>

462
00:32:57,683 --> 00:32:59,384
Wilson, check in.

463
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:01,887
Zammit, check in.

464
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,257
Taylor...

465
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:34,583
Garcia, get me outta here.

466
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:35,987
<i>Copy that. Ten klicks out.</i>

467
00:33:45,996 --> 00:33:48,230
<i>Oh, shit! I see him!</i>

468
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:49,935
Light him up!

469
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:57,141
Incoming!

470
00:33:59,677 --> 00:34:01,309
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

471
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:03,311
<i>Oh, no!</i>

472
00:34:03,313 --> 00:34:05,350
<i>I'm losing control!</i>

473
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:03,308
Sir, let's go.

474
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,648
Out of the van, please.

475
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:24,328
Who the hell is this?

476
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:36,942
Mr. Okoye and Dr. Caldwell.

477
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:40,909
I am Agent Harvey Russell.

478
00:35:40,911 --> 00:35:42,744
Hell of a day, huh?

479
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:45,515
Science experiments
falling from the sky.

480
00:35:45,517 --> 00:35:47,716
Giant gorilla on the loose.

481
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:50,853
Just the kind of exciting shit we here
at the government tend to notice.

482
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:53,288
Where's George? I need to
see him.

483
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,257
And if you're thinking about putting him on
that plane, it's gonna be a big mistake.

484
00:35:56,259 --> 00:35:57,962
I think we'll be all right.

485
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,065
Okay, let's all take a
breath and...

486
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:05,134
I said I wanna see George.

487
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:08,304
Or we can get in each other's
faces and see who's the toughest.

488
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:11,105
Brother, I'm gonna prance
myself right out on a limb,

489
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:15,076
and guess that no one's ever accused
you of being a people person.

490
00:36:15,078 --> 00:36:19,215
How about you take these cuffs
off and find out yourself?

491
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:20,485
Brother.

492
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:26,322
I'll see you on board.

493
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:28,326
Load 'em up with the ape.

494
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:32,564
So weird that he didn't take
your cuffs off.

495
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:47,311
- He's good.
- All right.

496
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,748
Just note it in the chart.

497
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:54,416
You see that?

498
00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:57,353
Where he cut himself breaking
out of the primate department.

499
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:59,288
There's barely a bruise now.

500
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,123
African spiny mouse.

501
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,996
Its DNA makes it capable
of extreme regeneration.

502
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:11,866
"Davis Okoye,
Primate Specialist."

503
00:37:11,868 --> 00:37:13,538
Blah, blah, blah.

504
00:37:15,806 --> 00:37:17,873
Army Special Forces.

505
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,476
What are you, some kind of
international man of mystery?

506
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:25,014
I see a lot of "redacted."
"Redacted, redacted..."

507
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:27,181
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

508
00:37:27,183 --> 00:37:31,219
"Transferred to the United Nations'
Special Anti-Poaching Task Force."

509
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:33,822
Well, I'll have you know that I,
myself, am also an animal lover.

510
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,491
Let's cut the bullshit,
Russell.

511
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:37,326
I told you, having George
on this airplane is suicidal.

512
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:39,194
He's on a very powerful
sedative drip.

513
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:42,331
He will not wake up until we
wake him up.

514
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:45,300
Sir, with all due respect,
at his rate of growth,

515
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:48,671
that sedative is gonna become ineffective
long before we're back on the ground.

516
00:37:48,673 --> 00:37:51,707
We factored in his growth rate.
Same as his elevated metabolism.

517
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,709
- Sir.
- And the increased amount of blood,

518
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:56,978
in his system. We may not be the
brightest bulbs in the room,

519
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,913
but we're doing all right.

520
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:01,250
<i>Especially considering,</i>

521
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:04,320
you got another one of your little science
experiments running around out there.

522
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:05,753
What do you mean another one?

523
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:07,922
Oh, you didn't know about
the 30-foot wolf?

524
00:38:07,924 --> 00:38:10,224
Oh, sir,

525
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:13,230
your oversized monkey
is old news.

526
00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:15,998
Jesus.

527
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,602
Weirdos on the Internet
are calling him "Ralph."

528
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:21,170
Who do you work for?

529
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:23,172
Sir, I work for the American
people.

530
00:38:23,174 --> 00:38:24,743
Homeland? CIA?

531
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:28,376
Justice League?

532
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:30,279
I'm OGA.

533
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:33,282
I've heard that bullshit before.
"Other Government Agency," huh?

534
00:38:33,284 --> 00:38:34,449
It's clever.

535
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:36,519
Yes, sir, it is clever.

536
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:39,521
You see, when science
shits the bed,

537
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:41,857
I'm the guy they call
to change the sheets.

538
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:43,891
What's gonna happen to George?

539
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:46,261
He didn't ask for any of this. He
sure as hell doesn't deserve it.

540
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:50,232
Whether it is his fault or
not, he is dangerous.

541
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:52,702
But there's a cure for this.

542
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:55,204
She helped engineer the
pathogen that infected George.

543
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:57,606
She works for Energyne.

544
00:38:57,608 --> 00:38:59,743
You mean used to.

545
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:10,219
"Dr. Kate Caldwell. Ph.D. in
Biochemistry from Stanford,

546
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:13,154
"with a specialty
in Conservation Genetics."

547
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:16,994
Recruited by Energyne in 2010.

548
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:20,929
Fired by Energyne,

549
00:39:20,931 --> 00:39:22,833
<i>a little less than two
years ago.</i>

550
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:25,266
It gets better.

551
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:28,270
Caught trying to steal
company hard drives,

552
00:39:28,272 --> 00:39:30,573
and did 13, what I'm sure
were glorious months,

553
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:34,613
in our beautiful Greenville
Federal Correctional Institute.

554
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:42,483
Well, I am guessing by the
look on the big fella's face

555
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:44,154
that this is all news to him.

556
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:49,257
Enjoy your flight.

557
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:52,697
Oh. Mr. Okoye,
about your friend.

558
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,933
For what it's worth,

559
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:59,371
I am truly sorry.

560
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,617
I'm sorry I lied to you.

561
00:40:14,284 --> 00:40:16,485
Can you cure George or not?

562
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:19,387
I know that Energyne was working on
a counter-measure to the pathogen,

563
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:20,958
Yes or no?

564
00:40:24,462 --> 00:40:26,063
No.

565
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,072
<i>Claire, I found him.</i>

566
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:40,041
Some black ops-looking dudes
loaded the gorilla,

567
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:44,045
into a cargo plane late last night.
You know who that is with them?

568
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:46,348
No. But clearly, he likes
hitting the gym.

569
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,851
No. The woman.

570
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:51,422
It's Kate Caldwell.

571
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:53,889
Dr. Caldwell.

572
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:56,891
Yeah. What's she doing
out there?

573
00:40:56,893 --> 00:41:00,161
Well, given our history
with her,

574
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:04,166
her blaming us for putting her in
prison and the death of her brother,

575
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:08,402
my best guess? Gathering
evidence to screw us over.

576
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:11,005
I told you, we should've
liquidated her two years ago.

577
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:13,208
Claire, you can't liquidate
every problem you have.

578
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,577
Agree to disagree.

579
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,911
Claire, I'm serious! Hey!

580
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:18,580
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

581
00:41:18,582 --> 00:41:20,582
but I don't even care
about the money anymore, okay?

582
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,050
I just don't want
to go to prison.

583
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:24,418
So if you have a plan,
I would love to hear it.

584
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,292
Brett, I always have a plan.

585
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:35,396
If you've given a subject
extraordinary genetic gifts,

586
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:38,233
and unlimited physical potential
combined with unthinkable violent,

587
00:41:38,235 --> 00:41:41,069
and aggressive disposition,
how do you control it?

588
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:43,237
I don't know,
you give it a chill pill or...

589
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,407
Yes. See?
That wasn't so hard.

590
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:46,875
Yes!

591
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:49,711
R-19, the chill pill.
One small dose will stop

592
00:41:49,713 --> 00:41:51,980
an infected creature's
growth and aggression.

593
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:55,918
And to draw them here, the pathogen
also genetically rewired the subject

594
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,487
to respond to a low
frequency radio wave.

595
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,755
Lucky for us,

596
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:03,593
this building has some of the most
powerful radio antennas in the world.

597
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:06,564
I had our team modify
this one last night.

598
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:19,974
Now, we just have to
turn on the signal.

599
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:22,244
And those creatures will
do anything to get here

600
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:23,844
and make it stop.

601
00:42:23,846 --> 00:42:26,447
How do you think that will
go over at 32,000 feet?

602
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:28,483
That monkey will bring the
whole plane down.

603
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:30,851
And when the wolf gets here,
we let the military kill it,

604
00:42:30,853 --> 00:42:33,487
and then we collect a sample
of the weaponized DNA.

605
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:35,593
Then we sell that shit
for a mint!

606
00:42:41,197 --> 00:42:42,668
Wow.

607
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:38,989
George, you okay, buddy?

608
00:43:57,107 --> 00:43:58,711
Oh, no.

609
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:06,417
Get up. Now!

610
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:14,559
<i>Caution. Caution. Caution.</i>

611
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,130
Aim for his body!

612
00:44:23,132 --> 00:44:24,435
Light him up!

613
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:27,938
Get back!

614
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:44,152
Come on, come on!

615
00:44:44,154 --> 00:44:45,289
Strap in.

616
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:03,574
6-1-2-Heavy,
mayday, mayday!

617
00:45:08,078 --> 00:45:09,515
Shit. Shit.

618
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:29,434
George.

619
00:45:53,557 --> 00:45:54,825
Oh, shit!

620
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:25,255
Hold on!

621
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:32,763
Davis!

622
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,599
<i>Hurry!</i>

623
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:48,409
Davis!

624
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:49,846
Swing me!

625
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:06,565
Now what?

626
00:47:13,871 --> 00:47:15,907
We're getting the hell off
this plane!

627
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:29,655
Hang on tight!

628
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,268
This is insane!
We're gonna die!

629
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,502
Probably!

630
00:47:47,504 --> 00:47:48,806
Now go!

631
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:17,702
God damn it, Russell!

632
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:37,152
Holy shit!

633
00:48:37,154 --> 00:48:38,789
You're welcome!

634
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:02,648
I'm sorry, George.

635
00:49:31,775 --> 00:49:33,444
Where's the body?

636
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:42,285
There isn't one.

637
00:49:44,186 --> 00:49:46,190
He's wounded but he survived.

638
00:49:49,526 --> 00:49:51,127
Tracks are headed northeast.

639
00:49:52,194 --> 00:49:53,927
And I got zero signal.

640
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:56,463
I'm gonna see if I can find
a radio, get it working.

641
00:49:56,465 --> 00:50:00,702
Once DoD figures out your
animal survived that crash,

642
00:50:00,704 --> 00:50:02,604
they're gonna have questions
for you two.

643
00:50:02,606 --> 00:50:04,438
What about Energyne?

644
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,775
They know a hell of a lot more
about this than we do.

645
00:50:06,777 --> 00:50:09,544
Yeah, the FBI's checking on
Energyne.

646
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:11,147
Listen, do me a favor,

647
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:14,317
don't meander off too far.

648
00:50:15,451 --> 00:50:17,485
Oh, Mr. Okoye.

649
00:50:17,487 --> 00:50:20,054
Yeah.

650
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:23,591
Thank you for getting this
old cowboy off that plane.

651
00:50:23,593 --> 00:50:25,795
Well, even assholes deserve
a second chance.

652
00:50:28,331 --> 00:50:31,099
Like my grandpappy
always said,

653
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:33,404
us assholes gotta stick
together.

654
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:39,074
Have you seen our
satellite footage?

655
00:50:39,076 --> 00:50:40,778
The gorilla survived
the crash!

656
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:43,911
Yes.

657
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:46,515
Unfortunately,
so did Dr. Caldwell.

658
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:48,351
So now what?

659
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,420
The gorilla doesn't
concern me.

660
00:50:52,422 --> 00:50:55,155
It'll respond to the radio
frequency and come straight to us.

661
00:50:55,157 --> 00:50:57,593
Dr. Caldwell is the bigger
problem.

662
00:50:57,595 --> 00:50:59,263
Do you think she told them
something?

663
00:51:03,299 --> 00:51:05,633
Based on the federal agents who are
about to walk through our door,

664
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:08,136
I'd say she told them
everything.

665
00:51:08,138 --> 00:51:09,273
What?

666
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:18,513
Ah...

667
00:51:18,515 --> 00:51:20,515
Claire Wyden.
How may I be of assistance?

668
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:22,483
Agent Park, FBI.

669
00:51:22,485 --> 00:51:24,985
This is a warrant for a complete
search of your company's records,

670
00:51:24,987 --> 00:51:26,487
starting with your lab.

671
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:28,324
Of course. Follow me.

672
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:36,197
We are horrified that what's happening
out there originated in this lab,

673
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:38,501
and we will do anything we
can to help.

674
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:40,802
Good, we need access to
everything.

675
00:51:40,804 --> 00:51:43,471
Absolutely.
You have our full cooperation.

676
00:51:43,473 --> 00:51:44,806
Every file.

677
00:51:44,808 --> 00:51:48,208
Hard drives and servers, too.
Let's go.

678
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,145
Step away from
your work station, sir.

679
00:51:50,147 --> 00:51:52,548
Could you open that up?
Keep yourself logged in.

680
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,349
Step back.

681
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:56,483
To that end, Agent Park, we're
going through the files

682
00:51:56,485 --> 00:51:59,655
of the scientist responsible for
these creatures, Dr. Kate Caldwell.

683
00:51:59,657 --> 00:52:02,422
I'm sure you're aware
of her criminal record.

684
00:52:02,424 --> 00:52:04,526
Unfortunately,
we're just now uncovering

685
00:52:04,528 --> 00:52:07,728
all the horrible things she was
doing during her time here.

686
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,664
I'll need that list of
Energyne servers, ASAP.

687
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:10,934
Of course, sir.

688
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:19,210
You okay?

689
00:52:20,577 --> 00:52:23,076
Because you're sweating.
A lot.

690
00:52:23,078 --> 00:52:24,344
No, I'm fine.

691
00:52:24,346 --> 00:52:26,282
Everything's fine.

692
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:31,186
Whiskey-Two-Tango,
Whiskey-Two-Tango,

693
00:52:31,188 --> 00:52:34,622
this is Echo-Four-Romeo, over.

694
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:37,791
<i>Whiskey-Two-Tango,
Whiskey-Two-Tango,</i>

695
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:40,295
<i>this is Echo-Four-Romeo.</i>

696
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:42,733
So, what do we do now?

697
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:46,867
I'm sorry, Doc.

698
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,869
There's no "we" anymore.

699
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:52,739
Look, I am sorry
I lied to you.

700
00:52:52,741 --> 00:52:54,642
Yeah, save it.

701
00:52:54,644 --> 00:52:57,244
You wanted something, you lied to get it.
You're human.

702
00:52:57,246 --> 00:52:59,449
What makes you dislike
people so much?

703
00:53:05,255 --> 00:53:07,087
Let me tell you something.

704
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:09,891
I've fought in wars all
over the world.

705
00:53:09,893 --> 00:53:14,161
Hunted down animal poachers,
Africa, India, South America.

706
00:53:14,163 --> 00:53:17,465
I got to see how people
really are.

707
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:20,003
And they'll pretty much do
anything to get what they want.

708
00:53:21,737 --> 00:53:23,741
You think we're all like that?

709
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:27,645
You know where I found George?

710
00:53:29,613 --> 00:53:31,948
<i>He was hiding underneath
the poacher's truck.</i>

711
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:36,651
<i>When my team arrived,</i>

712
00:53:36,653 --> 00:53:40,588
<i>these bastards were in the
middle of butchering his mother.</i>

713
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:45,092
<i>They were cutting off her hands so
they could sell them as ashtrays.</i>

714
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:47,295
<i>George never would've survived
on his own.</i>

715
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:50,367
<i>An albino like that on the black
market is worth a fortune.</i>

716
00:53:51,669 --> 00:53:53,470
So I took him with me.

717
00:53:56,438 --> 00:53:58,208
And what happened
to the poachers?

718
00:53:59,677 --> 00:54:02,980
Well, they shot at us
and they missed.

719
00:54:03,779 --> 00:54:05,315
I shot back.

720
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:07,184
I didn't.

721
00:54:34,512 --> 00:54:38,081
It's a good thing George doesn't
feel the same way about people.

722
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,584
What's that supposed to mean?

723
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:44,687
Oh. After what happened
to his family,

724
00:54:44,689 --> 00:54:47,358
it feels like it would be real
easy for him not to trust humans,

725
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:50,927
but he definitely trusts you.

726
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:54,395
Right?

727
00:54:54,397 --> 00:54:56,931
You're a geneticist,
you're not a shrink.

728
00:54:56,933 --> 00:55:01,201
I also have a Ph.D. in calling
people on their shit.

729
00:55:01,203 --> 00:55:04,237
Ah, well.
This ought to be good then.

730
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,741
Look, after college,
I was using CRISPR

731
00:55:07,743 --> 00:55:10,079
to help endangered species
in the Arctic.

732
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:14,181
Then my brother got sick.

733
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:17,184
Doctors told him he didn't
have much of a chance.

734
00:55:17,186 --> 00:55:18,889
But I knew CRISPR
could save him.

735
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:23,559
Then Claire Wyden showed up.

736
00:55:23,561 --> 00:55:26,893
She made me her lead
genetic researcher.

737
00:55:26,895 --> 00:55:29,564
- So Energyne recruited you?
- Yeah.

738
00:55:29,566 --> 00:55:31,600
But what I didn't
know was that

739
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:33,467
every time I'd make a breakthrough
that could help my brother,

740
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:36,239
they were secretly using it
to build weaponized DNA.

741
00:55:38,808 --> 00:55:40,777
I tried to destroy it.

742
00:55:42,411 --> 00:55:45,148
Security just got to me
before I could finish the job.

743
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:50,586
Anyway, uh,

744
00:55:50,588 --> 00:55:53,791
a month after I went
to prison, my brother died.

745
00:55:58,161 --> 00:56:00,496
I never even got to say
goodbye.

746
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:05,235
I'm sorry.

747
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:08,469
I just wanna make sure

748
00:56:08,471 --> 00:56:12,109
the Wydens can't hurt anyone
or anything ever again.

749
00:56:14,344 --> 00:56:16,013
Does that sound like a plan?

750
00:56:18,147 --> 00:56:19,583
Sounds like a plan.

751
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:28,424
Looks like our ride's here.

752
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:42,039
<i>...Captain Evans.</i>

753
00:56:45,642 --> 00:56:47,542
<i>Copy that.
Set a perimeter.</i>

754
00:56:52,014 --> 00:56:54,282
Colonel Blake, sir.

755
00:56:54,284 --> 00:56:56,651
<i>Black-Dog-Six-Actual, we have
eyes on targets Alpha and Bravo.</i>

756
00:56:56,653 --> 00:56:59,720
Roger that. Get in
position to box them in.

757
00:56:59,722 --> 00:57:01,322
<i>Roger, Six-Actual.</i>

758
00:57:01,324 --> 00:57:03,224
<i>Targets are eight klicks out
and moving fast.</i>

759
00:57:03,226 --> 00:57:04,828
George is with the wolf?

760
00:57:06,462 --> 00:57:08,029
You've engaged the
gorilla, sir?

761
00:57:08,031 --> 00:57:09,996
And the wolf.

762
00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:12,300
Got them surrounded in a quarry
about 30 miles outside Chicago.

763
00:57:12,302 --> 00:57:15,837
Their trajectories had them both going
in a straight line to the city.

764
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,338
Two different species making a
coordinated long-distance journey.

765
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,739
That just doesn't happen.

766
00:57:19,741 --> 00:57:20,907
Excuse me. Who is this?

767
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:22,844
Colonel, this is Davis Okoye.

768
00:57:22,846 --> 00:57:25,346
He's a primatologist.
He raised the gorilla there.

769
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:28,181
And that is Dr. Caldwell.
She worked for Energyne.

770
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:30,418
She helped cook up
our cuddly little friends.

771
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,353
Agent Russell, this is a
military operation.

772
00:57:32,355 --> 00:57:36,023
Yes, sir. I understand that, sir.
But right now,

773
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:39,259
these two know more about these
creatures than anyone on this planet.

774
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:42,096
I think you need to hear
what they have to say.

775
00:57:42,098 --> 00:57:44,398
<i>Colonel, what everybody
has to understand is</i>

776
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,900
this is no longer just a wolf
and a gorilla.

777
00:57:46,902 --> 00:57:49,103
A wolf and a gorilla would
be attacking each other.

778
00:57:49,105 --> 00:57:52,239
They wouldn't be traveling in a
straight line to the same destination.

779
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:54,342
Then what are they doing and
why are they going to Chicago?

780
00:57:54,344 --> 00:57:56,344
Because they're being called.

781
00:57:56,346 --> 00:57:59,179
When I was at Energyne,
we worked with bat DNA.

782
00:57:59,181 --> 00:58:02,551
The Wydens were obsessed with
developing biosonar communication,

783
00:58:02,553 --> 00:58:05,186
<i>and it looks like they got it
to work.</i>

784
00:58:05,188 --> 00:58:08,624
Energyne must be emitting some
kind of signal to draw them there.

785
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:11,291
Those creatures will do
anything

786
00:58:11,293 --> 00:58:14,728
to get to that signal and
make it stop.

787
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,098
Colonel, you have to
evacuate Chicago.

788
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,099
These creatures are engineered
to regenerate.

789
00:58:19,101 --> 00:58:20,768
<i>Bullets and tanks
are not gonna stop them.</i>

790
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,575
We have our contingencies
in order, Mr. Okoye.

791
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:25,775
Colonel.

792
00:58:29,478 --> 00:58:33,213
In the meantime, the FBI has
requested that you remain here.

793
00:58:33,215 --> 00:58:35,416
They have a few questions
of their own.

794
00:58:35,418 --> 00:58:36,918
These gentlemen will
see you out.

795
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,121
- Ma'am, let's go.
- Come on.

796
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,054
You're making a big
mistake, Colonel.

797
00:58:41,056 --> 00:58:43,491
Sir, let's go.

798
00:58:43,493 --> 00:58:46,159
<i>Targets in circle. All
Bushmasters, targets in three kill zone.</i>

799
00:58:46,161 --> 00:58:48,161
<i>Hold fire till playtime.</i>

800
00:58:48,163 --> 00:58:50,566
<i>Black-Dog-Six-Actual, we
have the targets surrounded.</i>

801
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,635
<i>Ambush is set.
All Bushmasters standing by.</i>

802
00:58:53,637 --> 00:58:55,005
Prepare to engage.

803
00:58:59,942 --> 00:59:03,514
This operation is gonna go south fast.
We have to get to Chicago.

804
00:59:05,447 --> 00:59:07,949
Yeah, I'm working on it.

805
00:59:07,951 --> 00:59:10,317
All right, you two. We're in
the transport to the left.

806
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,488
- Kate, come on, come on.
- Hey! Hey!

807
00:59:13,255 --> 00:59:14,689
Hey, I said left.

808
00:59:14,691 --> 00:59:16,290
Okay. Hold on a second, boys.

809
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:18,425
You look like very smart MPs.

810
00:59:18,427 --> 00:59:20,927
You also know there's a lot of bad
shit that's going on right now.

811
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:22,530
And I gotta be honest with
you both,

812
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:25,333
this stuff that we're doing?
It's not working for me.

813
00:59:25,335 --> 00:59:27,134
- Enough. Move!
- Okay, all right.

814
00:59:27,136 --> 00:59:28,604
Just consider this.

815
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,770
I'm a former team guy.
Let's not do this thing,

816
00:59:30,772 --> 00:59:32,840
where you get in my face,
you threaten me,

817
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:34,808
because I'm gonna have
to knock you out,

818
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,678
and then, you, look at me. I'm
gonna choke you out so bad,

819
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,513
you're gonna urinate yourself,
and in front of the lady.

820
00:59:39,515 --> 00:59:41,815
- It's not a good look.
- It wasn't a goddamn request!

821
00:59:41,817 --> 00:59:43,486
- Let's go!
- Hey!

822
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:52,192
This is exactly what I
didn't want to happen.

823
00:59:52,194 --> 00:59:54,462
That's a big arm.
Don't fight it.

824
00:59:54,464 --> 00:59:56,364
Don't fight it.

825
00:59:56,366 --> 00:59:58,735
There you go. Sleepy time.

826
01:00:03,206 --> 01:00:05,038
That's the plan you
were working on?

827
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,174
Well, I didn't kill them.

828
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:14,415
So what are we looking for?

829
01:00:14,417 --> 01:00:16,416
<i>We're looking
for a helicopter,</i>

830
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:18,386
<i>but preferably one that's not
surrounded by military personnel.</i>

831
01:00:18,388 --> 01:00:20,891
They probably have a grounded
medevac chopper at the hospital.

832
01:00:24,695 --> 01:00:26,730
And that's why you always
bring a doctor.

833
01:00:52,555 --> 01:00:53,857
Good job, Doc.

834
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,962
<i>Well, well, well, looky here.</i>

835
01:01:01,964 --> 01:01:04,264
Stealing the hospital
whirlybird.

836
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:06,099
Color me impressed.

837
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:08,402
That is creative.

838
01:01:08,404 --> 01:01:10,571
Come on. You already saw
what George did to our plane.

839
01:01:10,573 --> 01:01:13,074
You know everyone's
underestimating these animals.

840
01:01:13,076 --> 01:01:15,076
But you two have the magic
bullet?

841
01:01:15,078 --> 01:01:16,444
We think we know
where to find it.

842
01:01:16,446 --> 01:01:18,613
Listen,

843
01:01:18,615 --> 01:01:20,748
Claire Wyden is way too smart to
create a weapon she can't control.

844
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:24,117
They must have an antidote at
Energyne that can halt the mutations.

845
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:26,420
If we get our hands on it,
it could be our only shot

846
01:01:26,422 --> 01:01:28,792
to stop George and the wolf
before they level Chicago.

847
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:36,463
You know, this ain't
no truck stop, <i>amigo.</i>

848
01:01:36,465 --> 01:01:38,902
They don't just leave keys
under the visor.

849
01:01:39,935 --> 01:01:42,235
Wait, you're helping us?

850
01:01:42,237 --> 01:01:46,005
You saved my life. I reckon
it's the least I can do.

851
01:01:46,007 --> 01:01:48,074
<i>We're on the same page
when it comes to the Wydens.</i>

852
01:01:48,076 --> 01:01:51,177
They think they're
above the law.

853
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:53,246
And I wanna remind them
that they ain't.

854
01:01:53,248 --> 01:01:56,916
So yes, we are helping
each other.

855
01:01:56,918 --> 01:01:58,154
Do what you do.

856
01:01:59,422 --> 01:02:00,824
I'll be in touch.

857
01:02:01,924 --> 01:02:03,324
<i>Wow.</i>

858
01:02:03,326 --> 01:02:05,358
That went way better
than I thought it would.

859
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,427
Yeah, it did. I was hoping I could
knock him out, too, though.

860
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:09,963
You know there are other ways
of dealing with people, right?

861
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:12,101
I do know that, yeah, but
that's no fun.

862
01:02:14,637 --> 01:02:16,205
I assume you know how to
fly this thing.

863
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:20,110
Absolutely.

864
01:02:25,982 --> 01:02:27,782
It's coming back to me.

865
01:02:27,784 --> 01:02:30,119
It's all coming back,
right now.

866
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,353
Yeah.

867
01:02:33,355 --> 01:02:38,324
It's coming back.
It's coming back.

868
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:42,228
<i>Sir, we are 15 minutes from
sunrise. Call for fire to follow, over.</i>

869
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:45,271
<i>We have the targets.
Serpents are in position. It's playtime.</i>

870
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:49,402
Get the FLIR footage onscreen.

871
01:02:49,404 --> 01:02:51,506
<i>FLIR is up.</i>

872
01:02:51,508 --> 01:02:52,473
<i>This is Three-Six.
Targets in the open, over.</i>

873
01:02:52,475 --> 01:02:53,642
Clear to fire.

874
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,045
<i>Shot out.</i>

875
01:03:01,183 --> 01:03:03,750
<i>Good hit. Stand by for BDA.</i>

876
01:03:03,752 --> 01:03:05,319
Confirm EKIA.

877
01:03:05,321 --> 01:03:07,855
<i>Six-Alpha-Lobo X-ray.
Confirm EKIA. Over.</i>

878
01:03:07,857 --> 01:03:09,757
<i>Roger, Lobo. Stand by.</i>

879
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:11,528
Two-six, stay on overwatch.

880
01:03:13,228 --> 01:03:15,898
Echo-Zero-two,
moving to phase line gold.

881
01:03:17,433 --> 01:03:18,566
Jesus!

882
01:03:18,568 --> 01:03:21,434
Come on, come on.

883
01:03:21,436 --> 01:03:23,938
<i>Six-Alpha-Lobo X-ray.
Sitrep, over.</i>

884
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,673
Negative EKIA.

885
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:28,775
They must have moved, sir.
I say again, we no longer...

886
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,380
Jesus Christ!

887
01:03:33,382 --> 01:03:35,553
<i>They're on our east and west flanks!
Everybody move!</i>

888
01:03:39,622 --> 01:03:40,724
<i>Nothing's working!</i>

889
01:03:43,759 --> 01:03:47,030
Bushmaster-Six-Alpha, this is Lobo X-ray.
Need a sitrep, over.

890
01:03:47,897 --> 01:03:49,099
Captain Evans?

891
01:03:54,904 --> 01:03:58,471
Kaplan, inform the National Guard we're
moving forward with the contingency plan.

892
01:03:58,473 --> 01:04:00,474
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

893
01:04:00,476 --> 01:04:02,942
I want ground artillery rolling
into downtown Chicago, ASAP!

894
01:04:02,944 --> 01:04:04,978
This time, we throw everything
we can at these things,

895
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,380
and get people the hell out
of that city!

896
01:04:07,382 --> 01:04:10,116
<i>I want blockades at every
quarter mile south of the Loop!</i>

897
01:04:10,118 --> 01:04:12,152
<i>We evacuate
civilians to the north!</i>

898
01:04:12,154 --> 01:04:15,557
It's me. They are
evacuating Chicago.

899
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:18,157
<i>George and the wolf went
right through Blake's men.</i>

900
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:20,927
<i>Okoye, they are out in
front of you.</i>

901
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:22,065
Copy that.

902
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:28,335
What is it?

903
01:04:28,337 --> 01:04:30,578
They're never gonna get everyone
out of the city in time.

904
01:05:02,506 --> 01:05:03,641
Davis!

905
01:05:22,857 --> 01:05:24,391
<i>Two-Three,
targets in the open.</i>

906
01:05:24,393 --> 01:05:26,226
<i>Roger. You are clear and hot.</i>

907
01:05:26,228 --> 01:05:28,962
<i>Roger. Weapons free.
I'm engaging now.</i>

908
01:05:28,964 --> 01:05:30,664
<i>Jesus!
I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

909
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,366
<i>Bird down! Bird down!</i>

910
01:05:32,368 --> 01:05:34,569
<i>To hell with that,
I'm taking these things out.</i>

911
01:05:34,804 --> 01:05:36,306
<i>I have no control!</i>

912
01:05:45,047 --> 01:05:47,167
<i>Two-Nine firing, target hit.
Lighting him up.</i>

913
01:05:52,253 --> 01:05:53,753
<i>He hit me with something!</i>

914
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:55,054
<i>Lost tail rudders!</i>

915
01:05:55,056 --> 01:05:57,060
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
I'm going down!</i>

916
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:06,199
Status report.
Where is Warthog One?

917
01:06:06,201 --> 01:06:08,434
Inbound, sir.

918
01:06:08,436 --> 01:06:11,277
<i>- Warthog One, you are cleared hot.
- Roger that.</i>

919
01:06:17,913 --> 01:06:19,748
<i>This is Warthog One.
Targets missed.</i>

920
01:06:22,118 --> 01:06:25,052
<i>Lobo X-ray, request come
back around for another run.</i>

921
01:06:25,054 --> 01:06:28,255
Warthog One, this is Black-Dog-Six-Actual.
Hit them again.

922
01:06:28,257 --> 01:06:29,691
<i>Roger that.</i>

923
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,257
Kaplan, where are we
with the evacuation?

924
01:06:31,259 --> 01:06:33,695
50% downtown, sir.

925
01:06:33,697 --> 01:06:36,797
Sir, we have a bogey headed north
in the river, half mile out.

926
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,702
What the hell are you
talking about?

927
01:06:45,407 --> 01:06:46,640
Is that a ship?

928
01:06:46,642 --> 01:06:48,141
It's underwater, sir.

929
01:06:48,143 --> 01:06:50,479
We don't have any subs
in the area.

930
01:07:08,063 --> 01:07:10,399
Davis, there's something big
in the river.

931
01:07:40,295 --> 01:07:42,031
Well, that sucks.

932
01:07:43,364 --> 01:07:45,032
<i>This is Three-Two.</i>

933
01:07:45,034 --> 01:07:46,467
<i>We have enemy contact in the river!
How copy?</i>

934
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:48,201
<i>Say again, Three-Two?</i>

935
01:07:48,203 --> 01:07:50,003
<i>Enemy contact!
Target is heading east!</i>

936
01:07:50,005 --> 01:07:51,771
<i>Copy, Three-Two.
Call for fire to follow.</i>

937
01:07:51,773 --> 01:07:53,172
1 <i>Negative, negative!
Danger close!</i>

938
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:54,440
<i>Copy, Three-Two.</i>

939
01:07:54,442 --> 01:07:57,212
Direct all forces at that
thing now!

940
01:07:58,848 --> 01:08:01,815
<i>Enemy contact!
Three o'clock! Engage!</i>

941
01:08:01,817 --> 01:08:03,684
Flank him!

942
01:08:03,686 --> 01:08:04,951
Everything you've got!

943
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:06,320
Aim for the gills!

944
01:08:06,322 --> 01:08:07,625
Fire!

945
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:34,552
Fire! Fire! Fire!

946
01:08:53,102 --> 01:08:54,502
<i>They can't stop them.</i>

947
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:56,172
We gotta get that antidote.

948
01:09:12,855 --> 01:09:14,622
<i>Alpha-Six-Actual,
we can't hold them!</i>

949
01:09:14,624 --> 01:09:16,256
<i>I've lost half my men!
We're backing out!</i>

950
01:09:16,258 --> 01:09:18,225
Are we evacuated downtown?

951
01:09:18,227 --> 01:09:20,561
Clear at a 10-block radius from
Upper Wacker to Adams, sir.

952
01:09:20,563 --> 01:09:22,028
Prep the MOABs.

953
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:23,232
Roger that.

954
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,409
Colonel, you are about to drop the largest
conventional bomb in the arsenal,

955
01:09:36,411 --> 01:09:38,444
on US soil.

956
01:09:38,446 --> 01:09:41,747
With all due respect, sir, there
has got to be another way.

957
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:43,551
You drop that bomb,

958
01:09:43,553 --> 01:09:46,987
not only do you wipe out
half a city,

959
01:09:46,989 --> 01:09:49,055
but you'd destroy any
evidence.

960
01:09:49,057 --> 01:09:52,059
See, I got a team on the way to
Energyne to secure the antidote.

961
01:09:52,061 --> 01:09:56,631
So if you could divert some
resources and support them...

962
01:09:56,633 --> 01:09:59,765
Is this the same team that
stole my medevac chopper?

963
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:01,502
Davis Okoye
and Dr. Caldwell...

964
01:10:01,504 --> 01:10:03,570
Need to get the hell
out of there.

965
01:10:03,572 --> 01:10:06,405
And I need you to drop
the cowboy bullshit,

966
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:08,111
and get with the program.

967
01:10:11,413 --> 01:10:13,145
Well, sir,

968
01:10:13,147 --> 01:10:15,148
you know us cowboys.

969
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,851
We just can't stand
leaving our friends behind.

970
01:10:18,853 --> 01:10:21,588
Get your ass out of here!

971
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:25,328
Finally, an order of yours
I can agree with.

972
01:10:30,999 --> 01:10:33,035
Let's bring up a feed
on our stealth bombers.

973
01:10:35,771 --> 01:10:38,337
Bomber feed is up.

974
01:10:38,339 --> 01:10:41,676
<i>Viper Two-Five, you've been
released for mission execution, time now.</i>

975
01:10:41,678 --> 01:10:43,711
<i>Holding
short, runway two-five.</i>

976
01:10:43,713 --> 01:10:45,546
<i>Cleared for
take-off, runway two-five.</i>

977
01:10:45,548 --> 01:10:47,180
<i>Cleared for take-off,
two-five.</i>

978
01:10:47,182 --> 01:10:49,815
<i>Roger. Good luck.</i>

979
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:52,686
<i>Lobo X-ray, this is
Viper Two-Five.</i>

980
01:10:52,688 --> 01:10:54,721
<i>Package is airborne.</i>

981
01:10:54,723 --> 01:10:57,823
<i>We are inbound.</i>

982
01:10:57,825 --> 01:11:00,726
Agent Russell, here's the
information you requested.

983
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:03,497
That's the FBI's list
for Energyne's servers.

984
01:11:03,499 --> 01:11:04,965
You were right.

985
01:11:04,967 --> 01:11:06,966
There's one server that
they left off.

986
01:11:06,968 --> 01:11:09,071
And there's only two people
that have access to it.

987
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,543
Brett and Claire,
you sneaky sons of bitches.

988
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:17,313
- Thank you, son.
- Yes, sir.

989
01:11:21,182 --> 01:11:23,720
It's Russell. I need a ride.

990
01:11:25,722 --> 01:11:27,991
Come on, this way, this way!
Keep moving!

991
01:11:35,931 --> 01:11:38,000
- Where to?
- Eighty-fifth floor.

992
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:47,243
Lab's in here.

993
01:11:48,076 --> 01:11:49,842
Damn it!

994
01:11:51,548 --> 01:11:53,180
Hey, give me some good news.

995
01:11:53,182 --> 01:11:55,550
MOABs are 30 minutes out,
give or take.

996
01:11:55,552 --> 01:11:57,685
<i>Just one could take out
five city blocks.</i>

997
01:11:57,687 --> 01:11:59,019
<i>You better move!</i>

998
01:11:59,021 --> 01:12:01,020
I'm never taking your
call again.

999
01:12:01,022 --> 01:12:03,390
It's locked. What'd he say?

1000
01:12:03,392 --> 01:12:06,513
Uh, something about the mother of all
bombs is on its way and we need to hurry.

1001
01:12:09,932 --> 01:12:11,200
Okay.

1002
01:12:13,936 --> 01:12:15,469
Jeez!

1003
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:17,541
FBI must've confiscated
all the hard drives.

1004
01:12:18,941 --> 01:12:20,207
All right.

1005
01:12:20,209 --> 01:12:22,546
Come on, Kate, think.

1006
01:12:23,745 --> 01:12:24,980
Here we go.

1007
01:12:27,782 --> 01:12:31,752
Okay, everything in the lab
is on one system.

1008
01:12:31,754 --> 01:12:34,988
The FBI would never have thought
to confiscate a thermostat,

1009
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,823
but there's a backdoor into
the server.

1010
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:39,393
So we should be able to access
every file

1011
01:12:39,395 --> 01:12:41,228
from here.

1012
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:44,264
<i>Okay. Change of plan.
The military's lost control.</i>

1013
01:12:44,266 --> 01:12:45,931
We're coming up.

1014
01:12:45,933 --> 01:12:47,266
All right.

1015
01:12:47,268 --> 01:12:49,769
The chopper is ready.

1016
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:52,773
I have got your rat.

1017
01:12:52,775 --> 01:12:56,275
Let's get the R-19 from the
lab so we have some leverage

1018
01:12:56,277 --> 01:12:58,947
when this shitstorm
finally catches up with us.

1019
01:12:59,781 --> 01:13:01,280
Now what?

1020
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:02,451
We have visitors.

1021
01:13:05,087 --> 01:13:07,319
- I don't believe this.
- What's wrong?

1022
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:09,155
The system has been
totally scrubbed.

1023
01:13:09,157 --> 01:13:11,824
They erased everything
connected to the project.

1024
01:13:11,826 --> 01:13:13,694
But it's here.

1025
01:13:13,696 --> 01:13:15,465
We just have to find it.

1026
01:13:16,298 --> 01:13:17,501
In there!

1027
01:13:20,968 --> 01:13:22,270
I got this.

1028
01:13:29,512 --> 01:13:30,812
I like it.

1029
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,113
What are we looking for?

1030
01:13:33,115 --> 01:13:35,314
Anything that starts
with "RPG."

1031
01:13:35,316 --> 01:13:37,451
It'll be in one of these
cryopreserve trays.

1032
01:13:37,453 --> 01:13:38,885
Got it.

1033
01:13:38,887 --> 01:13:40,490
RPG, RPG.

1034
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:44,326
I think I found it.

1035
01:13:54,069 --> 01:13:55,237
This is it.

1036
01:13:56,737 --> 01:13:58,638
Is that the cure?

1037
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,974
Not a cure exactly.

1038
01:14:00,976 --> 01:14:04,310
R-19 doesn't revert them
to their normal size.

1039
01:14:04,312 --> 01:14:06,481
It just overrides
their unchecked aggression.

1040
01:14:09,418 --> 01:14:11,150
Nice to see you, Kate.

1041
01:14:11,152 --> 01:14:12,754
Go to hell, Claire.

1042
01:14:14,255 --> 01:14:17,527
I was so sorry
to hear about your brother.

1043
01:14:25,334 --> 01:14:27,571
Now, why don't you hand
those over?

1044
01:14:40,549 --> 01:14:42,882
All right, let's go.

1045
01:14:42,884 --> 01:14:44,454
That's not happening.

1046
01:14:46,688 --> 01:14:48,458
Can I see that, please?

1047
01:14:56,097 --> 01:14:57,232
Davis.

1048
01:15:00,702 --> 01:15:01,801
That happened.

1049
01:15:01,803 --> 01:15:03,068
Davis.

1050
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,439
Now, let's go.

1051
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:08,311
- Oh, my God!
- Now.

1052
01:15:18,588 --> 01:15:19,955
They're here.

1053
01:15:50,785 --> 01:15:51,786
Move!

1054
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:57,656
I was actually starting to worry about how
we were gonna reengineer the pathogen.

1055
01:15:58,628 --> 01:16:00,460
Then you showed up.

1056
01:16:00,462 --> 01:16:02,599
Now, get in unless you wanna
end up like your friend.

1057
01:16:20,848 --> 01:16:22,884
Brett! Get back here!

1058
01:16:33,361 --> 01:16:34,496
No!

1059
01:16:43,338 --> 01:16:44,340
Come on.

1060
01:16:53,181 --> 01:16:54,649
I thought you were dead!

1061
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,216
Well, I think she missed
all the vital organs,

1062
01:16:56,218 --> 01:16:57,651
but don't jinx it.

1063
01:16:57,653 --> 01:16:59,219
Now, let's get that
antidote. Come on!

1064
01:16:59,221 --> 01:17:00,755
Davis, wait.

1065
01:17:01,822 --> 01:17:03,258
I have one.

1066
01:17:04,559 --> 01:17:06,493
Okay, new plan.

1067
01:17:06,495 --> 01:17:07,860
We give it to George and maybe he
can help us stop the other two.

1068
01:17:07,862 --> 01:17:08,998
Okay.

1069
01:17:14,201 --> 01:17:17,042
Now, we just have to figure out how
the hell we're gonna give it to him.

1070
01:17:18,874 --> 01:17:20,242
We gotta move!

1071
01:17:26,616 --> 01:17:30,015
You know, I'm actually glad
you're both still alive.

1072
01:17:30,017 --> 01:17:31,384
Now, you can go up there
and distract your friend

1073
01:17:31,386 --> 01:17:32,888
while I get the hell
out of here!

1074
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:36,726
Or I could kill you both now!

1075
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:44,432
Okay.

1076
01:17:45,601 --> 01:17:47,035
I'll go.

1077
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:52,107
George!

1078
01:17:54,308 --> 01:17:57,243
Get away from me!
Get your hands off me!

1079
01:17:57,245 --> 01:17:59,248
What the hell are you doing?

1080
01:18:01,282 --> 01:18:03,084
Feeding the monster to
the gorilla!

1081
01:18:12,994 --> 01:18:15,264
Oh, shit!

1082
01:18:21,637 --> 01:18:22,902
What?

1083
01:18:22,904 --> 01:18:25,104
No, forget my sister!

1084
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:26,905
She lost her goddamn mind!

1085
01:18:26,907 --> 01:18:29,911
You just get an SUV over here!
You get me out of here now!

1086
01:18:32,347 --> 01:18:33,649
Damn, son!

1087
01:18:35,617 --> 01:18:38,984
Did you just run down
80 flights of stairs?

1088
01:18:38,986 --> 01:18:41,019
Who the hell are you?

1089
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:43,591
I'm the fella that was gonna run
up those stairs to arrest you.

1090
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,158
But, shit,

1091
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,863
you look so terrible
I feel kind of bad about it.

1092
01:18:51,932 --> 01:18:53,501
I'll tell you what.

1093
01:18:53,503 --> 01:18:56,636
Since you're working so hard
to get out of here,

1094
01:18:56,638 --> 01:18:59,606
I'm guessing you got a laptop
in that bag there.

1095
01:18:59,608 --> 01:19:02,274
You give it to me and you
can just get.

1096
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:04,310
Right out that door.

1097
01:19:04,312 --> 01:19:06,713
- Really?
- Yeah.

1098
01:19:06,715 --> 01:19:08,984
You just hand it over
and be on your way.

1099
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,186
Okay!

1100
01:19:14,188 --> 01:19:16,221
It's really my sister
who did all this.

1101
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,724
This wasn't even my idea.

1102
01:19:17,726 --> 01:19:19,859
Since when is
complicity a crime?

1103
01:19:19,861 --> 01:19:21,662
Exactly.

1104
01:19:21,664 --> 01:19:24,296
- See you, Tex!
- Hey!

1105
01:19:24,298 --> 01:19:26,259
Why don't you leave the
little fella here with me?

1106
01:19:28,035 --> 01:19:30,706
That's my pleasure.
I hate that thing!

1107
01:19:40,848 --> 01:19:42,047
Oh.

1108
01:19:42,049 --> 01:19:43,750
Damn.

1109
01:19:43,752 --> 01:19:45,254
That was a lot.

1110
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:51,491
Boy, I hope y'all have
a plan up there.

1111
01:19:51,493 --> 01:19:54,897
What do you say, little fella?
Let's you and I take another exit.

1112
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:17,717
When does the antidote
kick in?

1113
01:20:17,719 --> 01:20:20,019
Ten minutes, maybe.

1114
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:22,191
This building is not gonna
be standing in 10 minutes!

1115
01:20:29,763 --> 01:20:31,535
How the hell do we get
off this roof?

1116
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,769
Maybe we don't have
to get off the roof at all.

1117
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:38,773
What?

1118
01:20:43,044 --> 01:20:45,478
No, we definitely do!

1119
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,616
Come on, come on!

1120
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,783
Davis!

1121
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:52,619
There's no tail on this
helicopter!

1122
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:53,886
That's right. We don't
need one.

1123
01:20:53,888 --> 01:20:55,387
You do, if you wanna fly!

1124
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:57,557
We're not gonna fly,
we're gonna crash.

1125
01:20:57,559 --> 01:20:58,594
What?

1126
01:21:02,631 --> 01:21:04,930
Okay...

1127
01:21:04,932 --> 01:21:07,065
We just need to get enough lift to stay
on top of the building as it falls.

1128
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:08,736
You know,
just like riding an avalanche.

1129
01:21:09,638 --> 01:21:11,005
No, I don't know!

1130
01:21:20,683 --> 01:21:22,418
Come on, baby!
Here we go.

1131
01:21:39,467 --> 01:21:40,700
Oh, my God!

1132
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:42,036
This could get ugly.

1133
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,943
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1134
01:21:49,945 --> 01:21:50,946
Oh, Jesus!

1135
01:21:53,648 --> 01:21:55,851
Oh, my God!

1136
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:04,960
Hold on, Kate!

1137
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,469
Brace!

1138
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:03,552
I got you.

1139
01:23:15,129 --> 01:23:16,633
I need a drink.

1140
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:30,646
I can't believe we
survived that.

1141
01:23:33,882 --> 01:23:35,982
Wait, there's still
people here.

1142
01:23:35,984 --> 01:23:38,120
We need to call off the airstrike.
Come on.

1143
01:23:52,668 --> 01:23:53,936
Davis.

1144
01:23:55,504 --> 01:23:56,804
I know.

1145
01:24:03,512 --> 01:24:04,647
George?

1146
01:24:06,981 --> 01:24:08,183
You okay?

1147
01:24:20,528 --> 01:24:21,763
Thank God.

1148
01:24:23,263 --> 01:24:25,133
Good to have you back, buddy.

1149
01:24:30,038 --> 01:24:31,674
Oh, I look like shit?

1150
01:24:32,307 --> 01:24:33,673
<i>Okay.</i>

1151
01:24:33,675 --> 01:24:36,978
You look like big shit!

1152
01:24:55,963 --> 01:24:57,198
Come on.

1153
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:04,369
<i>Lobo X-ray, this is
Viper Two-Five.</i>

1154
01:25:04,371 --> 01:25:06,204
<i>Escorts are in position. We are
eight minutes from target.</i>

1155
01:25:06,206 --> 01:25:08,006
<i>Over.</i>

1156
01:25:08,008 --> 01:25:09,510
<i>Roger, Two-Five.
Call for fire to follow.</i>

1157
01:25:09,512 --> 01:25:11,013
<i>- Over.
- Copy that.</i>

1158
01:25:12,813 --> 01:25:14,415
Let's go! Let's go!

1159
01:25:16,417 --> 01:25:18,083
What's the plan?

1160
01:25:18,085 --> 01:25:20,418
I want you to take this Humvee
and find a sat phone.

1161
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:23,189
And get a hold of Russell. He's our only
shot at calling off this airstrike.

1162
01:25:23,191 --> 01:25:26,091
Then let him know there's still military
personnel and civilians on the ground.

1163
01:25:26,093 --> 01:25:27,593
George and I will handle
the other two.

1164
01:25:27,595 --> 01:25:29,362
- Davis?
- Yeah?

1165
01:25:29,364 --> 01:25:31,701
Try not to get killed, okay?

1166
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:33,936
Come on, get going.

1167
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:46,912
All right, George. We gotta stop these
things before they destroy the city.

1168
01:25:48,782 --> 01:25:51,453
That's right.
Let's kick some ass.

1169
01:26:09,971 --> 01:26:11,272
Oh, shit!

1170
01:26:33,661 --> 01:26:35,797
Of course the wolf flies.

1171
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:55,280
Hey!
Come and get me,

1172
01:26:55,282 --> 01:26:57,285
you ugly son of a bitch!

1173
01:27:04,926 --> 01:27:05,928
That's it!

1174
01:27:28,383 --> 01:27:30,216
Help! I need a satellite
phone!

1175
01:27:30,218 --> 01:27:31,884
It's not safe here, ma'am.
We need to go now.

1176
01:27:31,886 --> 01:27:33,152
You two, get her on the truck.

1177
01:27:33,154 --> 01:27:35,954
Wait! There's a way to
stop this!

1178
01:27:35,956 --> 01:27:37,122
Fellas.

1179
01:27:37,124 --> 01:27:38,457
Russell?

1180
01:27:38,459 --> 01:27:40,859
- I will take it from here.
- Yes, sir.

1181
01:27:40,861 --> 01:27:42,695
Take a breath, Doc.

1182
01:27:42,697 --> 01:27:44,063
Tell me what you're
doing here.

1183
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:45,831
The antidote worked.

1184
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,700
Davis and George are trying
to stop the other two.

1185
01:27:47,702 --> 01:27:50,002
But there's still civilians
and military on the ground.

1186
01:27:50,004 --> 01:27:52,374
We have to call off the
airstrike.

1187
01:27:55,743 --> 01:27:58,978
Son, I'll tell you what.
Let's trade.

1188
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,848
- All right, come on. Let's get.
- Hey. Hey!

1189
01:28:08,356 --> 01:28:10,025
George, go!

1190
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:29,503
Colonel Blake, it is your
old pal, Agent Russell.

1191
01:29:29,505 --> 01:29:31,103
Listen, about your MOABs.

1192
01:29:31,105 --> 01:29:33,139
Do me a favor, would you,

1193
01:29:33,141 --> 01:29:36,274
<i>and take a gander at Federal
Plaza before you drop them?</i>

1194
01:29:36,276 --> 01:29:38,411
Bring up the drone feed
on Federal Plaza.

1195
01:29:38,413 --> 01:29:39,514
Yes, sir.

1196
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,820
My God.

1197
01:30:42,477 --> 01:30:43,845
Oh, come on.

1198
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:02,564
George, no!

1199
01:31:05,432 --> 01:31:07,899
<i>This is Viper Two-Five.
Two minutes out.</i>

1200
01:31:07,901 --> 01:31:11,036
<i>Target is locked.
MOABs are armed.</i>

1201
01:31:11,038 --> 01:31:12,406
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

1202
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:27,886
Run!

1203
01:31:27,888 --> 01:31:29,958
Get up! You gotta move!

1204
01:31:57,418 --> 01:31:59,251
Come on, come on, come on!

1205
01:31:59,253 --> 01:32:00,656
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

1206
01:32:27,616 --> 01:32:29,656
You mess with my friend,
you mess with me, mother...

1207
01:32:44,665 --> 01:32:45,668
Shit!

1208
01:33:58,039 --> 01:33:59,174
George.

1209
01:34:02,611 --> 01:34:03,745
George.

1210
01:34:08,749 --> 01:34:10,519
I'll be damned.

1211
01:34:12,253 --> 01:34:13,555
Abort mission.

1212
01:34:46,954 --> 01:34:48,289
George.

1213
01:34:49,322 --> 01:34:50,726
Hey, buddy.

1214
01:34:59,734 --> 01:35:00,834
We did it.

1215
01:35:03,838 --> 01:35:05,407
We saved the city.

1216
01:35:11,411 --> 01:35:12,514
Yeah.

1217
01:35:13,313 --> 01:35:14,915
You saved me.

1218
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,319
George saved Davis.

1219
01:35:52,687 --> 01:35:53,822
George.

1220
01:35:55,656 --> 01:35:56,790
George!

1221
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,242
I'm so sorry, Davis.

1222
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:52,578
He saved my life.

1223
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,582
He saved a lot of
people's lives.

1224
01:37:22,877 --> 01:37:23,878
<i>Mommy!</i>

1225
01:37:35,789 --> 01:37:37,125
Yes, he did.

1226
01:37:47,334 --> 01:37:48,770
Did I just see you close
your eye?

1227
01:37:50,638 --> 01:37:52,472
I just saw you open your eye!

1228
01:37:58,513 --> 01:38:00,680
Son of a bitch!

1229
01:38:00,682 --> 01:38:02,247
Pretending to be dead?

1230
01:38:02,249 --> 01:38:04,587
- At a time like this?
- Oh, my God!

1231
01:38:10,456 --> 01:38:11,823
No, no.

1232
01:38:11,825 --> 01:38:13,824
No, it's not funny
and I wasn't crying!

1233
01:38:13,826 --> 01:38:16,193
I wasn't crying, okay? There's
a lot of debris around here!

1234
01:38:16,195 --> 01:38:18,095
Wait, is this like a thing
between you guys?

1235
01:38:18,097 --> 01:38:20,299
This is not a thing between us.
It's a thing with him!

1236
01:38:20,301 --> 01:38:22,803
Because he has a twisted
sense of humor!

1237
01:38:26,707 --> 01:38:30,510
Yes, I guess you could
say that.

1238
01:38:30,512 --> 01:38:33,144
She is part of my troop.

1239
01:38:33,146 --> 01:38:34,979
I mean, we're friends, right?

1240
01:38:34,981 --> 01:38:36,716
Yeah.

1241
01:38:36,718 --> 01:38:38,621
Yes, we're friends.

1242
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:44,122
No! Come on, dude!

1243
01:38:44,124 --> 01:38:45,957
Have some class, okay?

1244
01:38:45,959 --> 01:38:48,493
I don't know what's gotten into him.
Kate, I'm so sorry.

1245
01:38:48,495 --> 01:38:49,961
George, stop.

1246
01:38:49,963 --> 01:38:51,395
All right, all right, guys.

1247
01:38:51,397 --> 01:38:53,297
Let's go home, okay?

1248
01:38:53,299 --> 01:38:54,733
Dude, that was funny.

1249
01:38:54,735 --> 01:38:56,033
I heard that!

1250
01:38:56,035 --> 01:38:57,903
Shit.

1251
01:38:57,905 --> 01:39:01,038
Thank you for saving the
world.

1252
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,908
Yeah, thanks for calling off
the airstrike.

1253
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:05,210
Like a wise cowboy
once said,

1254
01:39:05,212 --> 01:39:08,479
us assholes gotta
stick together.

1255
01:39:08,481 --> 01:39:10,516
How about we all help
these people out,

1256
01:39:10,518 --> 01:39:12,651
and then find George
here a new home.

1257
01:39:12,653 --> 01:39:15,186
Where are we gonna put him?

1258
01:39:15,188 --> 01:39:18,256
I can tell you right now, we're
not gonna put him on a plane.

1259
