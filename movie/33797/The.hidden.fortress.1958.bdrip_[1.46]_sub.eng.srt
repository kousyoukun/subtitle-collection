12
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,706
Stay away from me!

13
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:03,666
You stink of dead bodies.

14
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:07,045
Stop it!
We both smell of corpses.

15
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,672
And it's all your fault!

16
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,224
Your smell makes me want to vomit.

17
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:23,394
Though shitworms can't smell shit.

18
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,063
What?

19
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:30,944
You're a shitworm.
You make me sick.

20
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:36,115
And you said we'd make a fortune
if we went to the war.

21
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,749
What's so funny, you idiot?

22
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,336
It's all funny!

23
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:53,424
First, we arrived late to the war.

24
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,929
Then they mistook us
for the defeated side

25
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,598
and forced us to bury the dead.

26
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,227
We finally escaped,

27
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,940
and now it's been two days
that we've only had water.

28
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:16,489
But the funniest thing
is your stupid crybaby face.

29
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,426
Let's go home.

30
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:22,805
Don't you have any pride?

31
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:28,603
We've even been stripped
of the arms we sold our homes for.

32
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:32,148
We can't go home like this.

33
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:35,193
Then take it off this dead guy.

34
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,907
Even if I'm desperate,
I'm not a thief.

35
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,494
Do what you want. I'm going!

36
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:48,414
Go. I'll come home
after I make a buck.

37
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,917
Don't come crying to me then.

38
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:55,254
Get caught again
and be a gravedigger.

39
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:59,050
Fool! Go away!

40
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,638
It'll be a blessing to see you go,

41
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,265
you shitworm!

42
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:35,169
We can't cross the border
from this road.

43
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,880
It's a Yamana checkpoint.

44
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,801
Not even a mouse
could pass through those barricades.

45
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:01,320
If they find us, we're dead.

46
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,257
What now?

47
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:30,058
Unless a fog rolls in,
we can't move.

48
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,953
What does it say up there?

49
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:55,792
It's a notice about a reward
for 10 pieces of gold.

50
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,044
Read it to me.

51
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,505
"Wanted.

52
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:05,218
Princess Yuki of Akizuki.

53
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:09,305
A reward of ten <i>ryo</i> for her capture.

54
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,891
Three <i>ryo</i>

55
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:17,939
for information
as to her whereabouts.

56
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,442
By order of the Lord of Yamana."

57
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,825
Move! Walk!

58
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,293
What are you doing? Move!

59
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,254
Walk!

60
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:51,973
- He's running away!
- Get him!

61
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:05,278
I'm not one of them.

62
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm thankful for the fog,
but I can't see anything.

63
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,678
Which way is Hayakawa?

64
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,431
Shut up and follow me!

65
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,576
What was that?

66
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,454
<i>Who goes there?</i>

67
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,108
Not grave digging again.

68
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,569
Keep walking!

69
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,293
Hey, it's Matashichi!

70
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,379
Matashichi!

71
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,005
Damn you!

72
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,594
Walk!

73
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,358
Listen!

74
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:54,905
There is 200 kan of pure gold
hidden in this castle.

75
00:10:55,281 --> 00:11:00,494
Until you find it,
you're no longer men but moles!

76
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:06,208
So dig!
Dig until you drop, moles!

77
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:30,352
Matashichi, this is hell!

78
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,896
It's the end!

79
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,149
If we're going to die,
let's die together.

80
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,325
That way!

81
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,716
<i>Thieves! Rice thieves!</i>

82
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:50,724
What shall we do now?

83
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,522
Find the princess.

84
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,066
The princess?

85
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,278
The sole survivor of the Akizuki clan.

86
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:06,991
I think the reward
on her head is 10 <i>ryo.</i>

87
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,577
Ten pieces of gold?

88
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,538
Informers get three.

89
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,957
Three pieces of gold?

90
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,674
It's no good.
That's only a dream.

91
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:27,595
If we get greedy and get caught,
we're done for.

92
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,767
I guess we'd better go home.

93
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:38,105
But how will we cross the border?

94
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,276
Bang and we're dead.

95
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,619
Let's eat.

96
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,663
I can't think on an empty stomach.

97
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,544
Not ready.

98
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,798
These don't burn at all.

99
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,620
What's this?

100
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,719
Why, it's gold!

101
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,394
You're right! It's gold!

102
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:08,696
But...

103
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,031
a piece of gold inside a stick?

104
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:17,830
I've heard of a rich man hiding gold
in the pillars of his home, but...

105
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,041
What's this? An insignia!

106
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,712
Looks like a crescent.

107
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,090
The crescent is the Akizuki crest!

108
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,636
That's the reserve gold
they were digging for in the castle.

109
00:17:57,161 --> 00:18:00,998
Tahei, you made the fire.
Where did you get the wood?

110
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,688
Let's split up and look.

111
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,777
I'll go this way.
You go over there to the marsh.

112
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,198
Hey, Tahei!

113
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,377
The same piece!

114
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,838
What are you doing?

115
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,965
One's mine!

116
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,591
I found both!

117
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,678
- I found the stick first.
- I threw it!

118
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,304
I picked up the gold!

119
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,891
Liar! I'm the one
who noticed it was gold.

120
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,518
Shh!

121
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,688
Let's go back.

122
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,898
Back?

123
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,110
There must be more.

124
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,197
If someone else notices it,
we're done for.

125
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,915
He's following us.

126
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,002
Watch out. Maybe he's a bandit.

127
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,921
He's not a bandit.
He has no sword.

128
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,967
You can't be sure.
He may work for one.

129
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,653
He stopped following us.

130
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,363
Let's go back.

131
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,869
No, better be careful.

132
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:50,208
It's late, anyway.
It won't hurt to wait one night.

133
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:54,129
It's a big job.
Better safe than sorry.

134
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:18,862
We haven't seen that guy since,
so maybe we didn't need to worry.

135
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,867
Probably a lumberjack
or a charcoal maker.

136
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:33,168
So, let's get this straight now.

137
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,714
What?

138
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:43,762
Don't play dumb.
How to split up the gold.

139
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:49,059
Let's be fair and divide it equally.

140
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,647
You don't like it?

141
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,654
- But I...
- Then it's settled! All right?

142
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,953
Let's sleep.

143
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:13,667
Sleep tight, and let's dream
of mountains of gold.

144
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:54,875
Hey!

145
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,214
Good eve -

146
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,516
Hey!

147
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,691
Cold, isn't it?

148
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:57,104
What are you doing here
in the mountains?

149
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,398
How about you?

150
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,484
Us?

151
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:07,364
We intend to cross the border.

152
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,116
The border?

153
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,204
- We want to go to Hayakawa.
- Hayakawa?

154
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,999
But beyond the mountains
it's Yamana.

155
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:25,799
Yes... but you see...

156
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:34,391
to go to Hayakawa...

157
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,770
This is Hayakawa.

158
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,356
And this is

159
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:46,653
Akizuki where we are now.

160
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,365
This is...

161
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,745
Yamana.

162
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:04,129
We want to go
from Akizuki to Hayakawa.

163
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:09,509
But the border
is guarded by Yamana soldiers.

164
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,470
So...

165
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,102
we'll cross first to Yamana

166
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,899
and then slip into Hayakawa.

167
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,611
See...

168
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,115
there's no way that survivors
of the Akizuki clan

169
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,659
would go to Yamana,
the enemy territory.

170
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:38,997
So the border
between Akizuki and Yamana

171
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,833
should be open.

172
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,211
That's right.

173
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:51,885
The Hayakawa-Yamana
border must be easier to cross

174
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:56,014
than the Akizuki-Hayakawa border.

175
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:01,186
Anyway, we're just peasants.

176
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:05,148
Even if anything happened,
we'd still make it.

177
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:21,498
All right.
I've made up my mind.

178
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:26,544
Going through Yamana is a good idea.

179
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:32,008
The 200 gold pieces are useless here,

180
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:35,679
but with three men and three horses,
we can carry it out.

181
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,354
200 gold pieces?
What are you talking about?

182
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,232
Be honest.

183
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,315
I've got an eye on that place.

184
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,896
Don't kick the stones.

185
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:10,690
You stop grabbing my leg.

186
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,201
What now?

187
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,288
What's he doing?

188
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,795
He's not here.

189
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,632
Where did he go?

190
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:04,137
That guy can't be trusted.

191
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:09,559
What is this place?

192
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,699
It's what they call a hidden fortress.

193
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:28,203
A hidden fortress?
The Akizuki one?

194
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,832
Look. You can see all of Yamana.

195
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,338
But...

196
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,842
for a fortress, it's strangely empty.

197
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,597
Someone's there!

198
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,731
What are you doing?

199
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:04,739
Oh, it's that guy.

200
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,451
Hey! Come down quickly!

201
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,225
How did you get down here?

202
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,143
What are your names?

203
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,396
I'm Matashichi.

204
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:38,273
I'm Tahei.

205
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:41,067
Matashichi, put the rice down.

206
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:44,279
Tahei, you put the rice in the pot.

207
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:47,907
Hurry up!

208
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,704
Where's the water?

209
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:57,834
I need a drink before the food.

210
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:01,421
Me too. I can't even spit anymore.

211
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:06,426
Hey! What's your name?

212
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:10,597
Me?

213
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,267
I'm Rokurota Makabe.

214
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:19,022
Rokurota Makabe?
I've heard that name before.

215
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:23,109
Makabe...

216
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,488
Rokurota Makabe...

217
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,951
Get out of here!

218
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:37,457
Rokurota Makabe is a legendary
Akizuki samurai general.

219
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,503
You take us for fools.

220
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,907
We shouldn't put up with this.

221
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:12,867
Hey!

222
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,247
Stop fooling around.
You're no general. You're just a bully.

223
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:21,918
What's with the big attitude?

224
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,215
Don't make fun of us!

225
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:30,134
Damn you!

226
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,287
What?

227
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,548
That wasn't very nice.

228
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:14,053
You could have told us
there was a secret passageway.

229
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:18,057
We've been partners since last night.

230
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:21,561
Besides, just because
you found this place first

231
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,105
doesn't mean you're the boss.

232
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:35,408
Let's decide now
how we're going to divvy it up.

233
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:39,746
Fair and square,
we share it in three equal parts. Deal?

234
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,289
There's the water.

235
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:05,980
Tastes great!

236
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,531
Excellent.

237
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:34,801
This is some fortress,
with water like this.

238
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,316
What the hell?

239
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,195
Don't bother.

240
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:57,949
I already went through there.
Just prepare the rice.

241
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:02,578
Shut up! I can't take it anymore!
You can stuff your orders!

242
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:04,747
You want to fight?

243
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:07,166
Don't hold back! Do him in!

244
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,699
Cook the rice.

245
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,419
It's a girl!

246
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,150
Where is she? Who is she?

247
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,401
I don't know.

248
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:18,905
She's really quick, though.
She's already gone.

249
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:27,204
Look. She's mine, okay?
I'll kill you if you go near her.

250
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,833
Cook, and then it's work.

251
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,838
What are you waiting for?

252
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:41,320
Don't touch me, fool!
It's uncomfortable enough.

253
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:46,409
It's your face
that makes me uncomfortable.

254
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,247
Leave my face alone.

255
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:59,755
I hate the way you blink
all the time.

256
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:04,844
There you go again.

257
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,096
Shut up!

258
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:12,018
Put your filthy teeth away.

259
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:18,524
Show them to me once more
and I'll bash them in.

260
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:38,210
I'm quitting! This is idiotic!
I dig and dig and nothing!

261
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,714
It's his fault.

262
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,807
Damn it! Gone again!

263
00:39:57,146 --> 00:40:03,110
He's on his high horse
watching us do all the work.

264
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:07,907
Right. He's probably running around
looking for that girl.

265
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:14,580
Maybe he already found a place
and is sleeping with her.

266
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:21,045
We agreed to split everything in three.
The girl should be the same.

267
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:24,173
That bully isn't just anyone.

268
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:27,259
I can't figure out what he's up to.

269
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:33,307
He may already have found
the 200 pieces of gold and moved them.

270
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:39,480
That's very likely. I'm sure of it.

271
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:47,947
That means he's hiding
the gold right now.

272
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:51,492
So if he's not in this fortress...

273
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,456
Look! There's something
suspicious about that spring.

274
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:03,045
Pretending like
he's already checked it out! Damn!

275
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:07,026
Where do you live?

276
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,324
Hey, lady, don't be mad.

277
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,666
Damn it!

278
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:30,132
You...

279
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:55,074
Wait!

280
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,710
What are you doing?

281
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,086
Shut up!

282
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:52,798
I told you I'd kill you
if you touched her!

283
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,055
Wait, boss. It's not fair.

284
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:01,473
Look.

285
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:04,310
The girl dropped this.

286
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:10,441
Don't go behind our back.
She's worth 10 <i>ryo.</i>

287
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:13,027
This does not belong
to a mountain girl.

288
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:17,990
Maybe you think
she's the Akizuki princess?

289
00:44:20,993 --> 00:44:22,494
You're right.

290
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:25,831
That comb does
belong to Princess Yuki.

291
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:29,960
But now it belongs to me.
Give it back.

292
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:35,549
I took it from the princess
and gave it to her.

293
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:37,509
- What?
- I don't lie.

294
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,930
Then where is Princess Yuki?

295
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,725
I captured her and handed her over
to the Yamana authorities.

296
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:48,937
Careful. I think he's full of crap.

297
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:57,654
Here's the reward of 10 ryo.
Still think it's a lie?

298
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:16,340
Tell me!
Where did Matashichi go?

299
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:17,883
I don't know!

300
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:23,055
What are you plotting? Tell me!

301
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,890
To the town.

302
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:27,393
The town? To do what?

303
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:30,229
He went to report.

304
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:32,147
Report who?

305
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:36,276
- The princess, of course.
- The princess?

306
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:47,162
We're not as stupid as you think.

307
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,751
You thought you had us fooled,
but we're not that gullible.

308
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:56,046
I know your game.

309
00:45:56,422 --> 00:46:01,093
The ten gold coins
you promised as a reward

310
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,431
are just part of the hidden gold
you've got stashed away.

311
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:09,351
You're greedy on top of it.

312
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:15,482
You want to capture the princess yourself
so you can have all the reward.

313
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:18,277
It won't go so smoothly.

314
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:22,364
I made a mistake by relying on scum.

315
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,701
You think you're better, scum?

316
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:35,169
Matashichi,
did you see the officers?

317
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:39,465
Fool! Do you think
I'd be back so soon?

318
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:42,134
It's the talk of the town already.

319
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:46,805
The princess was captured a while back,
and she was beheaded yesterday.

320
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:14,124
Boss, we're sorry we doubted you.

321
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:44,840
It's Rokurota Makabe.

322
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,425
<i>Welcome back.</i>

323
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,023
Any news?

324
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:04,901
Kofuyu served her duty.

325
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:13,952
The enemy will relax their guard now.

326
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,455
Now is our chance to escape.

327
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:21,126
What happened to Kofuyu?

328
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:26,465
As a dutiful servant,
my sister went in place of your Highness.

329
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:31,762
This assures
the safety of your Highness.

330
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:34,264
Rokurota!

331
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:38,852
Fool!
- What are you saying, your Highness?

332
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:43,148
Kofuyu was 16... I am 16.

333
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:46,234
What difference is there in our souls?

334
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,489
It is our duty as servants.

335
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:53,241
Kofuyu was honored...

336
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:54,660
Lies!

337
00:49:55,786 --> 00:49:58,914
If I were Kofuyu,
I would curse this princess.

338
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:04,836
Your words are too harsh.
Rokurota is in an awkward position.

339
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,463
Be quiet!

340
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:12,511
I don't even want to see your face!

341
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,806
Your nobility
doesn't let you shed a tear...

342
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,059
even when you've killed your sister.

343
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,686
Princess!

344
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:25,482
I hate it!

345
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:27,943
I hate it!

346
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,664
I don't know
what to do with her Highness.

347
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:43,709
It's the lord's fault.

348
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:46,461
Even if he was lacking an heir,

349
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:51,216
it was cruel
to raise her Highness like a boy.

350
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:55,637
Say right and she'll go left,
say left and she'll go right.

351
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:58,140
And though she is a girl,

352
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:03,478
she has never shown me a tear.

353
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:06,148
The same with her present behavior.

354
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,528
Insensitive to your pain
of having sacrificed your sister,

355
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:16,575
she herself doesn't shed a tear,
but she still criticizes you.

356
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,327
It's too much.

357
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,914
Her Highness is the real sacrifice.

358
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:27,627
Her suffering is having
to rebuild the Akizuki clan.

359
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:19,054
The Yamana soldiers are here!

360
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:22,140
There are horses at the spring.

361
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:20,282
This is good.

362
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:24,202
To fool the Yamana
by going through enemy lines.

363
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:29,207
This was the peasants' idea.

364
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:33,336
Depending on their answers,
I was ready to kill them.

365
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:38,133
But hearing their plan to go
through Yamana to Hayakawa,

366
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,551
I was stunned.

367
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:42,804
Sometimes even moss can be smart.

368
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:50,645
How long can we rely on them?

369
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:53,565
We can rely on their greed.

370
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:57,027
Make them carry gold
and they'll put up with anything.

371
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,864
That takes care of the gold.

372
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:07,913
But we cannot take a chance
with the princess.

373
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:12,751
But staying here isn't safe either.

374
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,339
This hidden fortress will soon be
discovered by the Yamana too.

375
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:22,677
And our deal with Lord Hayakawa
may not last either.

376
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:25,180
Understood.

377
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:30,894
But what shall we do
with the princess?

378
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:39,027
We can disguise her looks,
but not her class.

379
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:44,032
And her speech...

380
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,535
Her Highness will have to be a mute.

381
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:48,703
A mute?

382
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:54,084
Isn't there any other way?

383
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:56,628
There isn't.

384
00:54:56,962 --> 00:55:01,257
I don't know
if the princess would agree.

385
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:08,223
Leave it to me.

386
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:13,812
I hadn't ridden in a long time.

387
00:55:14,104 --> 00:55:18,233
She runs fast.
She's too good to be a packhorse.

388
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:21,945
Just in case you need to ride.

389
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:26,408
So we finally pass
through enemy lines.

390
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:33,415
Speaking of which,
could you play mute?

391
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:34,916
Mute?

392
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:39,337
I'm sure you couldn't do it.

393
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:47,846
To go through Yamana,
my greatest concern is your speech.

394
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:52,183
We were discussing
how you could be mute,

395
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:55,103
but I think it's impossible.

396
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,985
I was captured once
and had to pretend to be a mute.

397
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:05,363
It was agony.

398
00:56:05,572 --> 00:56:08,992
Your Highness couldn't take it.

399
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:20,503
I'm not biting.

400
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,341
When you say right, I say left.

401
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:29,220
I'm a handful.

402
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,723
Very well.

403
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:37,228
Let me use reverse psychology.

404
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:38,563
Princess.

405
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,315
Just like you.

406
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:48,823
All right.
This once I will let you fool me.

407
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,910
Otherwise your plan will be foiled.

408
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:54,120
Princess!

409
00:56:56,706 --> 00:57:00,043
Your noble face again.

410
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:04,422
If you need anything, tell me now.

411
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,592
Once I'm a mute,
I'm not talking until Hayakawa.

412
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:28,780
We have to tell him.

413
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:31,449
The bully? Never mind him.

414
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:41,459
Idiot, be quiet! We'll get caught!

415
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,087
You too!

416
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:05,400
Where are you going?

417
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:10,613
Boss, run!
The Yamana soldiers have found us.

418
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,907
There were horses

419
00:58:12,991 --> 00:58:14,742
by the spring.

420
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:22,834
Idiots. I stole those.

421
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:27,505
We can't carry 200 pieces of gold
without them.

422
00:58:28,256 --> 00:58:29,549
Gold?

423
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:32,510
We'll climb down today.

424
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:36,222
Where's the gold?

425
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:42,687
Hey, where's the gold?

426
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:53,323
Hey, where's the gold?

427
00:58:54,032 --> 00:58:57,410
Don't hold out on us. Come on.

428
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:08,421
I knew it!

429
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:12,717
Don't fool around with us.

430
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,720
You said you had already gone
through there.

431
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:19,015
Why did you make us dig
at the fortress?

432
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:21,559
I was testing you.

433
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:26,397
We'll need a lot of backbone
on the road. You did well.

434
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:30,610
Lift the gold out of the water
and onto the horses.

435
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:33,529
The three of us will carry the rest.

436
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:46,084
Gold!

437
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:50,046
Leave the gold in the wood.

438
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,379
Hey, Tahei!

439
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,634
Damn it!

440
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:44,976
Where did you hide this?

441
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:48,813
You're so suspicious.
That's just firewood.

442
01:00:52,442 --> 01:00:57,780
It's a bad idea to take the girl.
She'll slow us down.

443
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,910
What if she blabs?

444
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:07,415
- She's mute. Don't worry.
- Mute?

445
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:09,519
Stop!

446
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:35,294
This will be an easy border to cross.

447
01:02:35,962 --> 01:02:37,213
Wait.

448
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:41,884
Better be cautious.

449
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:51,269
Don't move till I come back.

450
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:04,282
If we want to get rid of him,
now's our chance.

451
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,122
Don't worry. She's mute.

452
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:13,082
She's mute but she can hear.

453
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:14,876
Stupid.

454
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:18,754
A mute can't speak
because she's deaf.

455
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,886
This is where we have to think.

456
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:30,224
He's sly, so we can't trust him
even if we cross into Hayakawa.

457
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:32,602
He'll cheat us.

458
01:03:33,603 --> 01:03:35,813
Let's run away.

459
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,274
What about his load?

460
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:42,403
We can't carry it.

461
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,239
We'll take his horse.

462
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:53,331
There's no time to argue.

463
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:56,959
Let's tell her
we're taking the horses for a drink.

464
01:04:07,178 --> 01:04:09,847
Fool!
They're not drinking sake.

465
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:49,637
Hurry!

466
01:06:09,258 --> 01:06:11,719
What are you doing?

467
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:50,508
Where are the horses?

468
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:02,853
What shall we do?

469
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,176
Princess!

470
01:07:38,431 --> 01:07:39,724
Princess!

471
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:44,937
It's frustrating to be a mute.
All I can do is watch.

472
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,188
The two of them?

473
01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:50,860
Out of greed, they took the horses.

474
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,072
Then the enemy spotted them.
Fine allies.

475
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:14,300
You!

476
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:23,559
We can't cross that river.

477
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:26,312
There's a firing squad
on the other side.

478
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:34,236
I know your game!

479
01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:36,447
Take the gold and get lost!

480
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:23,410
He's gone.

481
01:09:23,494 --> 01:09:24,995
He's not here.

482
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:30,584
Boss!

483
01:09:30,668 --> 01:09:33,462
Where are you, boss?

484
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,174
There he is.

485
01:09:39,969 --> 01:09:43,764
Boss, the other side
is lined with Yamana soldiers.

486
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:46,642
What would you do?

487
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,811
What do I care?

488
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:52,731
What are you doing?

489
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:54,692
Wait and see at the fortress?

490
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,528
Shut up! Go away!

491
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:00,739
Please, take us with you.

492
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:04,159
We promise to behave.

493
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,007
What's that?

494
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:34,398
The Yamana found it!

495
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:39,695
What will we do?

496
01:11:01,926 --> 01:11:03,427
We're leaving.

497
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:05,429
Which way?

498
01:11:05,596 --> 01:11:06,889
Straight ahead.

499
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:08,474
You're joking!

500
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:14,063
Leave it to me. I have a plan.

501
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:39,129
Your pass?

502
01:11:41,048 --> 01:11:42,633
Your pass!

503
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:52,768
Wait!

504
01:11:57,106 --> 01:11:58,774
Boss!

505
01:12:03,195 --> 01:12:04,655
Next!

506
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:09,952
Your pass.

507
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:12,162
What's your problem?

508
01:12:12,246 --> 01:12:13,664
I picked up something.

509
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:16,333
What? It's just a piece of wood.

510
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,128
I found it at Mt. Suribachi.

511
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:30,347
He found this.

512
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:34,268
Gold!

513
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:38,313
The Akizuki crest!

514
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:41,900
You really found it at Mt. Suribachi?

515
01:12:43,444 --> 01:12:45,654
Bring me my horse!

516
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:49,324
- That gold is mine. Give it back.
- No.

517
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:53,412
Give me the gold or a reward.

518
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:55,330
Shut up.

519
01:12:55,414 --> 01:12:56,832
Get lost.

520
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:59,626
Give me a reward.
I won't move!

521
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:02,296
You bastard!

522
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:16,185
A reward! Give me a reward!

523
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,772
A reward!

524
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:49,218
Greedy!

525
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:15,786
Two or three loaded horses,
several men and a girl.

526
01:14:15,953 --> 01:14:18,330
If you see such a group,
arrest them immediately.

527
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:22,584
There are signs that
Princess Yuki's party has been here.

528
01:14:22,668 --> 01:14:26,296
But she was beheaded.

529
01:14:26,797 --> 01:14:29,299
Using a double is nothing new.

530
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:33,137
You also saw the smoke rise
on the mountain.

531
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:35,430
That was Akizuki's hidden fortress.

532
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:38,809
It was guarded by an old soldier
and two others.

533
01:14:38,976 --> 01:14:41,270
They could have escaped.

534
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:45,440
Instead, they burned the fortress
and fought to the end.

535
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:50,320
It appears they wanted to signal
and gain time for others to escape.

536
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:56,827
The princess and a few men
escaped with the gold for sure.

537
01:14:56,994 --> 01:14:59,997
There are traces on the road.

538
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:05,460
Don't slack off. Catch them
and you will be rewarded.

539
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:41,747
Boss.

540
01:15:46,877 --> 01:15:48,837
Are you okay, boss?

541
01:15:49,171 --> 01:15:51,882
Let's take a back road.

542
01:15:52,049 --> 01:15:54,718
Stop sneaking around.
It invites suspicion.

543
01:15:54,885 --> 01:15:56,386
But...

544
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,149
What are you doing?

545
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:52,943
We're staying here tonight.

546
01:16:54,236 --> 01:16:55,487
Here?

547
01:16:57,739 --> 01:17:01,285
You've got to be kidding me.
Let's hurry through the night.

548
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:07,165
It's a long way. Let's not push it.

549
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:09,918
Then let's camp out.

550
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:15,132
Hide a stone among stones
and a man among men.

551
01:17:30,272 --> 01:17:32,357
Where will we hide the gold?

552
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:34,318
Leave it out in the open.

553
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,398
<i>You're so slow!</i>

554
01:18:13,482 --> 01:18:16,526
<i>Pay attention and bring some water!</i>

555
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:31,208
Always crying,
but you refuse to take johns.

556
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:34,127
You were a lousy deal.

557
01:18:34,211 --> 01:18:36,046
Where did you get her?

558
01:18:36,213 --> 01:18:37,672
In Akizuki.

559
01:18:37,756 --> 01:18:40,550
Lose a war
and plenty of women go on sale.

560
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:41,676
How much?

561
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,137
Five silver pieces. Want her?

562
01:18:44,221 --> 01:18:47,557
Idiot! I'm not a dog like you!

563
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:50,394
You're bluffing.

564
01:18:50,477 --> 01:18:51,937
No, sorry.

565
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,897
Look here.

566
01:18:59,403 --> 01:19:01,071
Look.

567
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:06,827
Average-looking, but excellent body.

568
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:08,703
How about it?

569
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:12,499
For one silver piece,
she's yours for the night.

570
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:18,130
What's the use of buying a woman
who won't take customers?

571
01:19:23,093 --> 01:19:25,512
How much is she?

572
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:30,934
She's a looker!

573
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:33,770
She's not one of yours?

574
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:43,613
I'll buy her.
Who does she belong to?

575
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,160
Whose girl is she?

576
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,957
I'll buy her!
I'll buy her for a piece of gold!

577
01:19:54,124 --> 01:19:55,125
<i>Enough!</i>

578
01:19:56,918 --> 01:19:59,796
She's a mute.
- Mute?

579
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:12,267
That's too bad. I'll pass.

580
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:35,457
Who owns the horse outside?

581
01:20:42,506 --> 01:20:44,007
Is it yours?

582
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:48,803
Do you want to sell her to me?
I'll give you whatever you want.

583
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:51,181
But my load...

584
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:55,519
She's too good for a packhorse.

585
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,522
Five silver pieces.

586
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,690
You can buy five horses.

587
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:12,410
Boss, what shall we do?

588
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:18,708
Two horses aren't enough
for everything.

589
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:24,381
It's hard to find another one.

590
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:41,940
Damn, this really stinks!

591
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:44,693
There's no time for girls.

592
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:52,742
Buy that girl back.

593
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:54,369
I cannot.

594
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:58,748
Why not? I am the Princess of Akizuki.

595
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:01,626
I can't bear to see
one of our own in trouble.

596
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:04,462
No, you're the one in trouble.

597
01:22:05,213 --> 01:22:08,258
Your kindness will be your downfall.

598
01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:11,136
I don't care.

599
01:22:13,013 --> 01:22:15,390
Buy her back.

600
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:18,018
No!

601
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:21,229
You cannot make
my heart mute too!

602
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,446
A cart was a bad idea.

603
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:32,282
We're the horses now.

604
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:35,118
And we've even taken in that girl.

605
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:54,638
Stop following us. Go away.

606
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:58,266
Go back to Akizuki.

607
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:10,987
Don't stop! Keep going!

608
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,003
Have you seen four people,
three horses and a girl?

609
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:33,176
If you do,
report them immediately.

610
01:23:41,685 --> 01:23:46,022
It went well. We're lucky.

611
01:23:54,531 --> 01:23:58,827
Who said a cart was a bad idea?

612
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,997
You were grumbling about the girl.

613
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:10,046
But those men are stupid.
Why not check the wood?

614
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:22,058
What shall we do now?

615
01:24:27,397 --> 01:24:28,940
Keep calm!

616
01:24:44,539 --> 01:24:46,040
Put it down!

617
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:55,425
Report them!

618
01:25:00,555 --> 01:25:02,932
Run! Wait on the hill!

619
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,399
Damn you!

620
01:26:16,965 --> 01:26:20,969
Why, if it isn't Rokurota Makabe!

621
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,349
Hey, Hyoe Tadokoro!

622
01:26:27,851 --> 01:26:32,856
Stand aside!
You're no match for him!

623
01:26:35,567 --> 01:26:37,151
A rare meeting.

624
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:41,948
I regret not meeting you
on the battlefield this time around.

625
01:26:43,283 --> 01:26:45,535
I regret it too.

626
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:53,126
How about a duel?

627
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:55,044
With pleasure!

628
01:26:58,798 --> 01:27:01,843
With what? A spear?

629
01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:04,929
Sounds good.

630
01:27:05,555 --> 01:27:08,516
All of them are inferior,
but choose one.

631
01:34:10,563 --> 01:34:11,772
I lost!

632
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:22,325
Wait!

633
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:37,214
We will meet again.

634
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:42,428
Rokurota!

635
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:47,975
Rokurota!

636
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:27,890
<i>Firewood? What about firewood?</i>

637
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:31,018
<i>Apparently there's gold</i>
<i>hidden in the wood.</i>

638
01:35:31,185 --> 01:35:34,271
They're hiding here with all that.

639
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:37,900
Four of them.
One girl with three men.

640
01:35:38,067 --> 01:35:40,903
She's Princess Yuki from Akizuki.

641
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:44,490
The reward is
20 pieces of gold for her.

642
01:35:44,657 --> 01:35:47,493
Five pieces just for information.

643
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:51,330
Don't jump the gun.
It won't be easy.

644
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:57,253
A strong general,
Rokurota Makabe, is with her.

645
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:25,656
It's cold!

646
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:29,952
It's been three days now.

647
01:36:31,287 --> 01:36:35,291
- More rain. More rain.
- What?

648
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:40,629
We can't move even if it stops.

649
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:45,593
We go out there
and we'll get beheaded.

650
01:36:45,759 --> 01:36:49,472
You madman!
Are you glad to be beheaded?

651
01:36:50,598 --> 01:36:52,224
Why not?

652
01:36:52,975 --> 01:36:55,895
It's better than putting up with this!

653
01:36:56,979 --> 01:37:00,733
Then give up the gold and get lost.

654
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:04,778
Good idea.

655
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,655
I'm leaving.

656
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:09,950
But I'm taking all I can carry.

657
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:11,869
I'll be set for life.

658
01:37:23,672 --> 01:37:25,508
I'm leaving too.

659
01:37:29,512 --> 01:37:30,513
Great.

660
01:37:31,597 --> 01:37:33,974
What's left is all mine.

661
01:37:34,433 --> 01:37:36,936
Take what you want and beat it.

662
01:37:44,318 --> 01:37:48,030
But we're not getting anywhere.

663
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,668
Where are you going?

664
01:38:01,335 --> 01:38:04,922
I'm going to find something
to put the gold in.

665
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:26,670
Whoever draws the shorter one
disappears for a while.

666
01:40:29,858 --> 01:40:31,694
He's late.

667
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:36,907
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

668
01:41:26,415 --> 01:41:30,043
What's going on?
Everyone's carrying wood.

669
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:32,629
I know!
It's the Fire Festival.

670
01:41:33,422 --> 01:41:36,425
Haven't you heard
of the Yamana Fire Festival,

671
01:41:36,592 --> 01:41:39,428
where the villagers dance
around a bonfire?

672
01:41:39,636 --> 01:41:41,430
We lucked out!

673
01:41:45,434 --> 01:41:49,772
They're going in our direction.
If we join the crowd...

674
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,073
I don't get it.

675
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,659
Why do we have
to patrol a Fire Festival?

676
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:07,039
Look. There's a lot of wood
at the festival.

677
01:42:07,122 --> 01:42:12,795
The Akizuki clan may hide here
with their gold hidden in firewood.

678
01:42:13,962 --> 01:42:15,464
What's this?

679
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:52,376
- What's wrong?
- We'll push together.

680
01:43:17,985 --> 01:43:19,987
There's too much wood to check.

681
01:43:20,153 --> 01:43:22,447
We'll inspect the suspicious ones...

682
01:43:23,782 --> 01:43:25,617
who stray from the crowd.

683
01:43:54,396 --> 01:43:56,440
- Where is everyone?
- At the festival.

684
01:43:56,607 --> 01:43:58,609
Marching with the crowd.

685
01:44:07,284 --> 01:44:15,000
<i>The life of a man</i>

686
01:44:16,919 --> 01:44:22,591
<i>Burn it in the fire</i>

687
01:44:24,301 --> 01:44:31,308
<i>The life of an insect</i>

688
01:44:33,602 --> 01:44:38,106
<i>Throw it into the fire</i>

689
01:44:42,611 --> 01:44:50,160
<i>When you realize</i>

690
01:44:52,287 --> 01:44:58,168
<i>The world is dark</i>

691
01:44:59,795 --> 01:45:08,804
<i>Life is just a dream</i>

692
01:45:11,139 --> 01:45:18,146
<i>Lose yourself</i>

693
01:45:41,712 --> 01:45:46,133
Burn it!
Throw the cart into the fire!

694
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:47,509
No!

695
01:45:49,886 --> 01:45:53,557
Don't be stingy, fool!

696
01:45:54,683 --> 01:45:55,976
No!

697
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:58,979
They're suspicious.

698
01:45:59,688 --> 01:46:00,772
Move!

699
01:46:00,856 --> 01:46:02,315
Burn it!

700
01:46:02,733 --> 01:46:05,986
- Make room!
- Here we go!

701
01:46:07,904 --> 01:46:10,782
No, don't!

702
01:46:19,666 --> 01:46:20,834
Dance!

703
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:50,215
That's enough.
Let's pack it up.

704
01:47:50,298 --> 01:47:52,259
But, boss, there's more.

705
01:47:52,676 --> 01:47:54,136
Don't be greedy.

706
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:58,098
There's no point
taking more than we can carry.

707
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:02,644
You two carry 30 <i>kan</i> each.

708
01:48:03,645 --> 01:48:06,398
I'll carry 40.
With the two women, that's 20 more.

709
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:08,859
What?
I can carry 40 kan too.

710
01:48:09,025 --> 01:48:10,777
I'll carry 50 kan.

711
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:53,820
Hurry up!

712
01:49:40,867 --> 01:49:44,079
It's such a shame to leave that gold.

713
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,418
Go back?

714
01:49:57,884 --> 01:50:00,512
Where are you going?

715
01:50:31,626 --> 01:50:33,461
No more.

716
01:50:34,337 --> 01:50:36,172
What are you looking for?

717
01:51:43,323 --> 01:51:44,741
<i>Help!</i>

718
01:51:47,535 --> 01:51:50,163
Boss, help us!

719
01:52:20,151 --> 01:52:22,695
If you want to live,
pick up your load.

720
01:52:50,557 --> 01:52:52,642
Follow me!

721
01:53:35,685 --> 01:53:37,479
Matashichi!

722
01:54:23,107 --> 01:54:27,612
Hurry up! We can cross
the mountain overnight.

723
01:55:12,991 --> 01:55:16,411
It's hard. I'd rather be dead.

724
01:55:18,037 --> 01:55:20,582
Then die.

725
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,250
What?

726
01:55:41,936 --> 01:55:43,938
Boss!

727
01:55:44,272 --> 01:55:45,690
Calm down!

728
01:56:06,919 --> 01:56:08,463
Don't stand up!

729
01:56:10,798 --> 01:56:15,219
Listen! I'll run and distract them.
Escape while you can.

730
01:56:39,619 --> 01:56:41,204
Hey!

731
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:47,669
We're done for! Let's run!

732
01:56:49,253 --> 01:56:51,005
Farewell!

733
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:53,591
Did you say something?

734
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:12,694
I'm not worth it.

735
01:57:13,569 --> 01:57:16,989
Leave me and go!

736
01:57:43,725 --> 01:57:46,978
This is the end.

737
01:57:49,814 --> 01:57:52,900
If we get caught, they'll kill us.

738
01:57:55,987 --> 01:57:58,698
Not if we don't have any gold.

739
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:01,075
We'll turn them in.

740
01:58:01,576 --> 01:58:05,538
You're right.
Maybe we'll even get a reward.

741
01:58:05,621 --> 01:58:06,873
Idiot!

742
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:10,752
They'll shoot us if we're not careful.

743
01:58:13,337 --> 01:58:18,926
I'm sure Yamana's increasing
the patrols at the Hayakawa border.

744
01:58:19,886 --> 01:58:22,013
We can report them there.

745
01:58:54,462 --> 01:58:55,713
Princess!

746
01:59:18,277 --> 01:59:20,655
Your Highness! Hayakawa!

747
01:59:37,171 --> 01:59:41,509
Are you joking?
We got them and their gold long ago.

748
01:59:41,676 --> 01:59:43,511
Go home, fools.

749
01:59:44,053 --> 01:59:45,930
Let's drink up!

750
02:00:19,046 --> 02:00:21,883
Look carefully!

751
02:00:22,341 --> 02:00:25,303
You won't see 200 gold pieces again!

752
02:00:28,806 --> 02:00:30,224
Wait.

753
02:00:30,308 --> 02:00:32,351
I'd rather see Princess Yuki!

754
02:00:32,518 --> 02:00:34,604
She's a sight for sore eyes.

755
02:00:35,229 --> 02:00:39,191
To think she'll be
beheaded tomorrow...

756
02:00:41,402 --> 02:00:42,403
Stay back!

757
02:00:42,486 --> 02:00:44,405
Just a glance.

758
02:00:47,658 --> 02:00:48,993
<i>Let me through!</i>

759
02:00:52,246 --> 02:00:55,833
<i>Tadokoro here to identify them.</i>

760
02:01:17,021 --> 02:01:18,773
Hyoe Tadokoro!

761
02:01:33,454 --> 02:01:35,247
What happened to you?

762
02:01:46,968 --> 02:01:48,636
Where did you get that scar?

763
02:02:00,940 --> 02:02:03,693
You've changed.

764
02:02:07,113 --> 02:02:08,489
Naturally.

765
02:02:10,783 --> 02:02:13,119
Tell me what happened.

766
02:02:13,619 --> 02:02:17,665
We're on opposite sides,
but we're true friends.

767
02:02:18,416 --> 02:02:19,583
Friends?

768
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:24,338
Then why did you let me survive
the shame of my defeat?

769
02:02:25,006 --> 02:02:28,342
To defeat an enemy yet let him live
may seem kind,

770
02:02:28,426 --> 02:02:31,387
but it's cruel.

771
02:02:31,637 --> 02:02:34,181
Look at me. Look!

772
02:02:34,807 --> 02:02:37,143
My lord shamed me before everyone.

773
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:40,187
See the scar left
by the relentless beating?

774
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:43,274
Curse you!

775
02:02:43,441 --> 02:02:44,525
Fool!

776
02:02:45,693 --> 02:02:48,279
So this is the great Hyoe Tadokoro?

777
02:02:50,865 --> 02:02:54,994
What you make
of another's kindness is up to you.

778
02:02:55,953 --> 02:02:59,040
As is the lord,
so is the retainer.

779
02:03:00,124 --> 02:03:04,837
To punish you so
for losing to an enemy...

780
02:03:06,172 --> 02:03:09,008
Even I would not dare such a thing.

781
02:03:09,175 --> 02:03:10,801
I'm the princess! It's me!

782
02:03:10,968 --> 02:03:12,219
That's enough!

783
02:03:13,554 --> 02:03:17,224
I appreciate your loyalty,
but this is it.

784
02:03:19,727 --> 02:03:22,146
I want to die with dignity.

785
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:27,359
Your Highness, your servant Rokurota
cannot apologize enough.

786
02:03:28,235 --> 02:03:33,491
You endured so much,
and it was all in vain.

787
02:03:33,657 --> 02:03:35,576
You're wrong, Rokurota.

788
02:03:36,869 --> 02:03:38,871
I have enjoyed the journey.

789
02:03:41,582 --> 02:03:44,585
The happiness of these days

790
02:03:44,752 --> 02:03:47,046
I would have never known
living in the castle.

791
02:03:49,757 --> 02:03:52,259
I've seen people as they are,
without pretense.

792
02:03:53,094 --> 02:03:54,970
I've seen their beauty...

793
02:03:56,347 --> 02:03:58,224
and their ugliness...

794
02:03:59,725 --> 02:04:01,727
with my own eyes.

795
02:04:03,896 --> 02:04:07,566
Rokurota, I thank you.

796
02:04:09,527 --> 02:04:13,280
I can now die without regret.

797
02:04:13,948 --> 02:04:15,533
Your Highness!

798
02:04:16,617 --> 02:04:18,035
Rokurota.

799
02:04:19,578 --> 02:04:23,457
That Fire Festival was wonderful.

800
02:04:26,252 --> 02:04:28,587
That song has stayed with me.

801
02:04:32,258 --> 02:04:42,257
<i>The life of a man</i>

802
02:04:47,106 --> 02:04:53,404
<i>Burn it in the fire</i>

803
02:04:57,241 --> 02:05:05,666
<i>The life of an insect</i>

804
02:05:09,295 --> 02:05:15,134
<i>Throw it into the fire</i>

805
02:05:20,347 --> 02:05:30,191
<i>When you realize</i>

806
02:05:33,694 --> 02:05:40,284
<i>The world is dark</i>

807
02:05:44,163 --> 02:05:51,879
<i>Life is just a dream</i>

808
02:05:52,338 --> 02:05:55,674
<i>Lose yourself</i>

809
02:07:03,742 --> 02:07:11,292
<i>The life of a man</i>

810
02:07:15,546 --> 02:07:19,717
<i>Burn it in the fire</i>

811
02:07:28,434 --> 02:07:30,060
Let's burn it!

812
02:07:32,771 --> 02:07:34,481
Turn the horses around!

813
02:07:38,235 --> 02:07:39,987
Turn them around, I said!

814
02:07:50,164 --> 02:07:51,665
He's mad!

815
02:07:52,124 --> 02:07:54,501
Get them!

816
02:08:25,532 --> 02:08:29,536
Hurry, Rokurota!
Take the princess!

817
02:08:30,954 --> 02:08:32,623
Let go!

818
02:08:41,006 --> 02:08:44,343
She is a great leader.
Serve her well.

819
02:08:46,637 --> 02:08:47,554
Hyoe!

820
02:08:49,556 --> 02:08:52,434
Don't die in vain!
If you wish, follow us!

821
02:08:57,815 --> 02:08:59,316
Come!

822
02:09:00,901 --> 02:09:02,319
Very well!

823
02:09:32,099 --> 02:09:33,934
Forgive this traitor!

824
02:11:46,191 --> 02:11:47,442
Damn.

825
02:11:48,652 --> 02:11:52,614
When I got to Hayakawa
with the gold,

826
02:11:52,781 --> 02:11:56,034
I imagined I'd be so happy.

827
02:12:02,708 --> 02:12:05,586
We're lucky to have our heads.

828
02:12:07,254 --> 02:12:10,716
Let's stay friends.

829
02:12:13,510 --> 02:12:16,054
We risked death together.

830
02:12:16,221 --> 02:12:19,891
We'll stay friends back in the village.

831
02:12:42,831 --> 02:12:44,249
Stray horses.

832
02:12:59,389 --> 02:13:00,974
Gold!

833
02:13:19,201 --> 02:13:20,327
This is all mine.

834
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:23,246
What?
Give me one of them.

835
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:25,582
I found them first.

836
02:13:25,666 --> 02:13:28,043
You're greedy.

837
02:13:28,293 --> 02:13:32,005
You said we should
split everything fifty-fifty.

838
02:13:32,089 --> 02:13:34,132
That was then. This is now!

839
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:37,594
You shithead!

840
02:14:35,944 --> 02:14:37,446
You.

841
02:14:38,071 --> 02:14:39,823
Are you from the Akizuki clan?

842
02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:44,911
No, we're just peasants.

843
02:14:45,662 --> 02:14:49,916
I don't get it.
Peasants with all this gold?

844
02:14:54,629 --> 02:14:56,131
Arrest them!

845
02:15:09,186 --> 02:15:14,733
Let's stay friends in heaven too.

846
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:42,803
<i>Matashichi! Tahei!</i>

847
02:15:42,969 --> 02:15:44,304
<i>Look up!</i>

848
02:15:53,146 --> 02:15:55,732
What? It's me.

849
02:15:55,816 --> 02:15:57,609
No wonder.

850
02:15:58,610 --> 02:16:00,821
Even I didn't recognize you.

851
02:16:00,904 --> 02:16:04,282
Your armor becomes you.

852
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:08,703
Rokurota Makabe.

853
02:16:11,039 --> 02:16:13,625
You look even more handsome.

854
02:16:21,758 --> 02:16:27,264
You don't recognize
your Princess Yuki?

855
02:16:31,685 --> 02:16:34,312
The mute. The mute girl.

856
02:17:14,227 --> 02:17:15,437
Matashichi.

857
02:17:16,104 --> 02:17:17,314
Tahei.

858
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:22,652
You two went through a lot for us.

859
02:17:23,695 --> 02:17:29,659
However, that gold is
indispensable funds to restore Akizuki.

860
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:34,748
Not I, not even
the princess, can take it.

861
02:17:36,291 --> 02:17:39,544
I hope you will be
satisfied with this.

862
02:17:39,753 --> 02:17:42,756
Here.

863
02:17:45,425 --> 02:17:47,177
Split it fairly.

864
02:17:48,762 --> 02:17:49,971
No fighting.

865
02:18:19,250 --> 02:18:22,671
You keep this.

866
02:18:23,588 --> 02:18:25,507
No, you keep it.

867
02:18:26,132 --> 02:18:27,342
But...

868
02:18:27,509 --> 02:18:29,594
Don't worry about it.

869
02:18:45,193 --> 02:18:49,948
THE END
