12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,711
Stay away from me!

13
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,678
You stink of dead bodies.

14
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,037
Stop it!
We both smell of corpses.

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,669
And it's all your fault!

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,238
Your smell makes me want to vomit.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,393
Though shitworms can't smell shit.

18
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,073
What?

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,953
You're a shitworm.
You make me sick.

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,117
And you said we'd make a fortune
if we went to the war.

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,755
What's so funny, you idiot?

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,318
It's all funny!

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,433
First, we arrived late to the war.

24
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,917
Then they mistook us
for the defeated side

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,594
and forced us to bury the dead.

26
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,238
We ñnally escaped,

27
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,917
and now it's been two days
that we've only had water.

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,472
But the funniest thing
is your stupid crybaby face.

29
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,433
Let's go home.

30
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,793
Don't you have any pride?

31
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,592
We've even been stripped
of the arms we sold our homes for.

32
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,160
We can't go home like this.

33
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,200
Then take it off this dead guy.

34
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,917
Even if I'm desperate,
I'm not a thief.

35
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,478
Do what you want. I'm going!

36
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,389
Go. I'll come home
after I make a buck.

37
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,910
Don't come crying to me then.

38
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,239
Get caught again
and be a gravedigger.

39
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,038
Fool! Go away!

40
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,638
It'll be a blessing to see you go,

41
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,277
you shitworm!

42
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,154
We can't cross the border
from this road.

43
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,880
<i>It's a Yamana Checkpoint.</i>

44
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,798
Not even a mouse
could pass through those barricades.

45
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,314
If they ñnd us, we're dead.

46
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,239
What now?

47
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,029
Unless a fog rolls in,
we can't move.

48
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,949
What does it say up there?

49
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,791
It's a notice about a reward
for 10 pieces of gold.

50
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,034
Read it to me.

51
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,515
"Wanted."

52
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,197
Princess Yuki of Akizuki.

53
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,314
A reward of ten /yo for her capture.

54
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,872
Three /yo

55
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,911
for information
as to her whereabouts.

56
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,437
"By order of the Lord of Yamana."

57
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,839
Move! Walk!

58
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,271
What are you doing? Move!

59
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,239
Walk!

60
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,951
- He's running away!
- Get him!

61
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,275
I'm not one of them.

62
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,877
I'm thankful for the fog,
but I can't see anything.

63
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,672
Which way is Hayakawa?

64
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,434
Shut up and follow me!

65
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,553
What was that?

66
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,432
<i>Who goes there?</i>

67
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,111
Not grave digging again.

68
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,550
Keep walking!

69
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,278
Hey, it's Matashichi!

70
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,355
Matashichi!

71
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,993
Damn you!

72
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,594
Walk!

73
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
Listen!

74
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,916
There is 200 kan of pure gold
hidden in this castle.

75
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,480
Until you ñnd it,
you're no longer men but moles!

76
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,199
So dig!
Dig until you drop, moles!

77
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,359
Matashichi, this is hell!

78
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,874
It's the end!

79
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,152
If we're going to die,
let's die together.

80
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,314
That Way!

81
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,714
<i>Thie ves! Rice thie ves!</i>

82
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,715
What shall we do now?

83
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,511
Find the princess.

84
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,073
The princess?

85
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,273
The sole survivor of the Akizuki clan.

86
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,991
I think the reward
on her head is 10 ryo.

87
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,558
Ten pieces of gold?

88
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,513
Informers get three.

89
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,953
Three pieces of gold?

90
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,673
It's no good.
That's only a dream.

91
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,590
If we get greedy and get caught,
we're done for.

92
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,750
I guess we'd better go home.

93
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,118
But how will we cross the border?

94
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,274
Bang and we're dead.

95
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,599
Let's eat.

96
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,679
I can't think on an empty stomach.

97
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,559
Not ready.

98
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,793
These don't burn at all.

99
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,595
What's this?

100
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,711
Why, it's gold!

101
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,400
You're right! It's gold!

102
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,675
But...

103
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,036
a piece of gold inside a stick?

104
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,836
I've heard of a rich man hiding gold
in the pillars of his home, but...

105
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,036
What's this? An insignia!

106
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,718
Looks like a Crescent.

107
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,074
The Crescent is the Akizuki crest!

108
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,632
That's the reserve gold
they were digging for in the castle.

109
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,994
Tahei, you made the fure.
Where did you get the wood?

110
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,677
Let's split up and look.

111
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,751
I'll go this way.
You go over there to the marsh.

112
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,200
Hey, Tahei!

113
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,352
The same piece!

114
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,829
What are you doing?

115
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,957
One's mine!

116
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,599
I found both!

117
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,673
- I found the stick ñrst.
- I threw it!

118
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,319
I picked up the gold!

119
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,871
Liar! I'm the one
who noticed it was gold.

120
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,514
Shh!

121
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,673
Let's go back.

122
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,874
Back?

123
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,114
There must be more.

124
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,198
If someone else notices it,
we're done for.

125
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,918
He's following us.

126
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,994
Watch out. Maybe he's a bandit.

127
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,913
He's not a bandit.
He has no sword.

128
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,960
You can't be sure.
He may work for one.

129
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,631
He stopped following us.

130
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,359
Let's go back.

131
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,872
No, better be careful.

132
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,195
It's late, anyway.
It won't hurt to wait one night.

133
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,115
It's a big job.
Better safe than sorry.

134
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,877
We haven't seen that guy since,
so maybe we didn't need to worry.

135
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,872
Probably a lumberjack
or a charcoal maker.

136
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,159
So, let's get this straight now.

137
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,718
What?

138
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,752
Don't play dumb.
How to split up the gold.

139
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,035
Let's be fair and divide it equally.

140
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,632
You don't like it?

141
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,632
- But I...
- Then it's settled! All right?

142
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,953
Let's sleep.

143
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,671
Sleep tight, and let's dream
of mountains of gold.

144
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,870
Hey!

145
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,189
Good eve -

146
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,510
Hey!

147
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,679
Cold, isn't it?

148
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,111
What are you doing here
in the mountains?

149
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,396
How about you?

150
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,474
Us?

151
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,350
We intend to cross the border.

152
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,113
The border?

153
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,198
- We <i>want to go to Hayakawa.
- Hayakawa?</i>

154
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,994
But beyond the mountains
it's Yamana.

155
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,796
Yes... but you see...

156
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,392
<i>to go to Hayakawa...</i>

157
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,750
This is Hayakawa.

158
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,355
And this is.

159
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,639
Akizuki where we are now.

160
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,354
This is...

161
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,751
<i>Yamana.</i>

162
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,118
We want to go
from Akizuki to Hayakawa.

163
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,514
But the border
is guarded by Yamana soldiers.

164
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,479
So...

165
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,119
we'll cross ñrst to Yamana

166
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,880
and then slip into Hayakawa.

167
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,599
See...

168
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,110
there's no way that survivors
of the Akizuki clan

169
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,635
would go to Yamana,
the enemy territory.

170
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,994
So the border
between Akizuki and Yamana

171
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,834
should be open.

172
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,195
That's right.

173
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,871
The Hayakawa-Yamana
border must be easier to cross

174
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,990
than the Akizuki-Hayakawa border.

175
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,196
Anyway, we're just peasants.

176
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,149
Even if anything happened,
we'd still make it.

177
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,471
All right. I've made up my mind.

178
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,552
Going through Yamana is a good idea.

179
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,994
The 200 gold pieces are useless here,

180
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,676
but with three men and three horses,
we can carry it out.

181
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,358
200 gold pieces?
What are you talking about?

182
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,238
Be honest.

183
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,314
I've got an eye on that place.

184
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,876
Don't kick the Stones.

185
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,679
You stop grabbing my leg.

186
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,193
What now?

187
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,270
What's he doing?

188
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,792
He's not here.

189
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,632
Where did he go?

190
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,119
That guy can't be trusted.

191
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,552
What is this place?

192
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,669
It's what they call a hidden fortress.

193
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,191
A hidden fortress?
The Akizuki one?

194
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,830
Look. You can see all of Yamana.

195
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,319
But...

196
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,832
for a fortress, it's strangely empty.

197
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,593
Someone's there!

198
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,715
What are you doing?

199
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,716
Oh, it's that guy.

200
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,433
Hey! Come down quickly!

201
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,236
How did you get down here?

202
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,152
What are your names?

203
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,391
<i>I'm Matashichi.</i>

204
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,278
I'm Tahei.

205
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,075
Matashichi, put the rice down.

206
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,279
Tahei, you put the rice in the pot.

207
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,920
Hurry UP!

208
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,718
Where's the water?

209
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,832
I need a drink before the food.

210
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,438
Me too. I can't even spit anymore.

211
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,436
Hey! What's your name?

212
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,600
Me?

213
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,280
I'm Rokurota Makabe.

214
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,033
Rokurota Makabe?
I've heard that name before.

215
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,114
Makabe...

216
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,476
Rokurota Makabe...

217
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,953
Get out of here!

218
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,434
Rokurota Makabe is a legendary
Akizuki samurai general.

219
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,519
You take us for fools.

220
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,910
We shouldn't put up with this.

221
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,875
Hey!

222
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,239
Stop fooling around.
You're no general. You're just a bully.

223
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,918
What's with the big attitude?

224
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,195
Don't make fun of us!

225
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,113
Damn you!

226
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,269
What?

227
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,551
That wasn't very nice.

228
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,032
You could have told us
there was a secret passageway.

229
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,035
We've been partners since last night.

230
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,552
Besides, just because
you found this place ñrst

231
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,109
doesn't mean you're the boss.

232
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,391
Let's decide now
how we're going to divvy it up.

233
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,754
Fair and square,
we share it in three equal parts. Deal?

234
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,274
There's the water.

235
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,953
Tastes great!

236
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,513
Excellent.

237
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,796
This is some fortress,
with water like this.

238
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,313
What the hell?

239
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,199
Don't bother.

240
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,955
I already went through there.
Just prepare the rice.

241
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,557
Shut up! I can't take it anymore!
You can stuff your orders!

242
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,750
You want to ñght?

243
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,150
Don't hold back! Do him in!

244
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,679
Cook the rice.

245
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,391
It's a girl!

246
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,159
Where is she? Who is she?

247
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,389
I don't know.

248
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,916
She's really quick, though.
She's already gone.

249
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,190
Look. She's mine, okay?
I'll kill you if you go near her.

250
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,833
Cook, and then it's work.

251
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,832
What are you waiting for?

252
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,313
Don't touch me, fool!
It's uncomfortable enough.

253
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,399
It's your face
that makes me uncomfortable.

254
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,235
Leave my face alone.

255
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,754
I hate the way you blink
all the time.

256
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,834
There you go again.

257
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,079
Shut up!

258
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,999
Put your ñlthy teeth away.

259
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,513
Show them to me once more
and I'll bash them in.

260
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,193
I'm quitting! This is idiotic!
I dig and dig and nothing!

261
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,715
It's his fault.

262
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,789
Damn it! Gone again!

263
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,111
He's on his high horse
watching us do all the work.

264
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,918
Right. He's probably running around
looking for that girl.

265
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,551
Maybe he already found a place
and is sleeping with her.

266
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:21,031
We agreed to split everything in three.
The girl should be the same.

267
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,159
That bully isn't just anyone.

268
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,239
I can't ñgure out what he's up to.

269
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,316
He may already have found
the 200 pieces of gold and moved them.

270
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,469
That's very likely. I'm sure of it.

271
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,956
That means he's hiding
the gold right now.

272
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,479
So if he's not in this fortress...

273
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,431
Look! There's something
suspicious about that spring.

274
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,038
Pretending like
he's already checked it out! Damn!

275
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,031
Where do you live?

276
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,316
Hey, lady, don't be mad.

277
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,673
Damn it!

278
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,118
You...

279
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,076
Wait!

280
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,715
What are you doing?

281
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,074
Shut up!

282
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,790
I told you I'd kill you
if you touched her!

283
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,029
Wait, boss. It's not fair.

284
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,470
Look.

285
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,315
The girl dropped this.

286
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,429
Don't go behind our back.
She's worth 10 ryo.

287
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,037
This does not belong
to a mountain girl.

288
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,990
Maybe you think
she's the Akizuki princess?

289
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,479
You're right.

290
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,834
That comb does
belong to Princess Yuki.

291
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,950
But now it belongs to me.
Give it back.

292
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,550
I took it from the princess
and gave it to her.

293
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,517
- What?
- IdonlHe.

294
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,909
Then where is Princess Yuki?

295
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,720
I captured her and handed her over
to the Yamana authorities.

296
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,916
Careful. I think he's full of crap.

297
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,631
Here's the reward of 10 ryo.
Still think it's a lie?

298
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,317
Tell me!
Where did Matashichi go?

299
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,874
I don't know!

300
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,032
What are you plotting? Tell me!

301
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,875
To the town.

302
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,395
The town? To do what?

303
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,235
He went to report.

304
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,152
Report who?

305
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,279
- The princess, of course.
- The princess?

306
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,154
We're not as stupid as you think.

307
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,756
You thought you had us fooled,
but we're not that gullible.

308
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,037
I know your game.

309
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,071
The ten gold coins
you promised as a reward

310
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,438
are just part of the hidden gold
you've got stashed away.

311
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,353
You're greedy on top of it.

312
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,471
You want to capture the princess yourself
so you can have all the reward.

313
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,275
It won't go so smoothly.

314
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,353
I made a mistake by relying on scum.

315
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,714
You think you're better, scum?

316
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,160
Matashichi,
did you see the ofñcers?

317
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,473
Fool! Do you think
I'd be back so soon?

318
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,109
It's the talk of the town already.

319
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,791
The princess was captured a while back,
and she was beheaded yesterday.

320
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,112
Boss, we're sorry we doubted you.

321
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,833
It's Rokurota Makabe.

322
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,433
<i>Welcome back.</i>

323
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,035
Any news?

324
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,917
Kofuyu served her duty.

325
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,950
The enemy will relax their guard now.

326
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,431
Now is our chance to escape.

327
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,112
What happened to Kofuyu?

328
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,476
As a dutiful servant,
my sister went in place of your Highness.

329
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,752
This assures
the safety of your Highness.

330
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,274
Rokurota!

331
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,830
Fool!
What are you saying, your Highness?

332
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,153
Kofuyu was 16... I am 16.

333
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,231
What difference is there in our souls?

334
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,473
It is our duty as servants.

335
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,234
Kofuyu was honored...

336
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,640
Lies!

337
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,918
If I were Kofuyu,
I would curse this princess.

338
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,837
Your words are too harsh.
Rokurota is in an awkward position.

339
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,479
Be quiet!

340
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,516
I don't even want to see your face!

341
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,790
Your nobility
doesn't let you shed a tear...

342
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,033
even when you've killed your sister.

343
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,673
Princess!

344
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,474
I hate it!

345
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,949
I hate it!

346
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,670
I don't know
what to do with her Highness.

347
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,718
It's the lord's fault.

348
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,474
Even if he was lacking an heir,

349
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,191
it was cruel
to raise her Highness like a boy.

350
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,633
Say right and she'll go left,
say left and she'll go right.

351
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,109
And though she is a girl,

352
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,474
she has never shown me a tear.

353
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,154
The same with her present behavior.

354
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,516
Insensitive to your pain
of having sacriñced your sister,

355
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,549
she herself doesn't shed a tear,
but she still criticizes you.

356
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,320
It's too much.

357
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,915
Her Highness is the real sacriñce.

358
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,635
Her suffering is having
to rebuild the Akizuki clan.

359
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,035
The Yamana soldiers are here!

360
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,115
There are horses at the spring.

361
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,279
This is good.

362
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,194
To fool the Yamana
by going through enemy lines.

363
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,190
This was the peasants' idea.

364
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,313
Depending on their answers,
I was ready to kill them.

365
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,111
But hearing their plan to go
through <i>Yamana</i> to <i>Hayakawa,</i>

366
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,554
I was stunned.

367
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,792
Sometimes even moss can be smart.

368
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,634
How long can we rely on them?

369
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,549
We can rely on their greed.

370
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,031
Make them carry gold
and they'll put up with anything.

371
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,879
That takes care of the gold.

372
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,916
But we cannot take a chance
with the princess.

373
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,754
But staying here isn't safe either.

374
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,315
This hidden fortress will soon be
discovered by the Yamana too.

375
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,674
And our deal with Lord Hayakawa
may not last either.

376
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,159
Understood.

377
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,870
But what shall we do
with the princess?

378
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,031
We can disguise her looks,
but not her class.

379
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,033
And her speech...

380
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,520
Her Highness will have to be a mute.

381
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,715
A mute?

382
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,079
Isn't there any other way?

383
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,633
There isn't.

384
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,238
I don't know
if the princess would agree.

385
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,231
Leave it to me.

386
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,790
I hadn't ridden in a long time.

387
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,239
She runs fast.
She's too good to be a packhorse.

388
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,950
Just in case you need to ride.

389
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,394
So we ñnally pass
through enemy lines.

390
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:33,392
Speaking of which,
could you play mute?

391
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,914
Mute?

392
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,310
I'm sure you couldn't do it.

393
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,838
To go through Yamana,
my greatest concern is your speech.

394
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,199
We were discussing
how you could be mute,

395
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,110
but I think it's impossible.

396
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,999
I was captured once
and had to pretend to be a mute.

397
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,359
It was agony.

398
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,996
Your Highness couldn't take it.

399
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,516
I'm not biting.

400
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,357
When you say right, I say left.

401
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,198
I'm a handful.

402
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,719
Very well.

403
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:37,240
Let me use reverse psychology.

404
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,549
Princess.

405
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,314
Just like you.

406
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,835
All right.
This once I will let you fool me.

407
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,911
Otherwise your plan will be foiled.

408
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,120
Princess!

409
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,031
Your noble face again.

410
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,435
If you need anything, tell me now.

411
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,595
Once I'm a mute,
I'm not talking until Hayakawa.

412
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,755
We have to tell him.

413
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,429
The bully? Never mind him.

414
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,430
Idiot, be quiet! We'll get caught!

415
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,074
You too!

416
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,392
Where are you going?

417
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,589
Boss, run!
The Yamana soldiers have found us.

418
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,910
There were horses

419
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,752
by the spring.

420
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,830
Idiots. I stole those.

421
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,509
We can't carry 200 pieces of gold
without them.

422
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,560
Gold?

423
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,510
We'll climb down today.

424
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,238
Where's the gold?

425
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,679
Hey, where's the gold?

426
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,316
Hey, where's the gold?

427
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,396
Don't hold out on us. Come on.

428
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,430
I knew it!

429
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,719
Don't fool around with us.

430
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,713
You said you had already gone
through there.

431
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,998
Why did you make us dig
at the fortress?

432
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,556
I was testing you.

433
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,398
We'll need a lot of backbone
on the road. You did well.

434
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,589
Lift the gold out of the water
and onto the horses.

435
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,513
The three of us will carry the rest.

436
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,074
Gold!

437
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,038
Leave the gold in the wood.

438
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,358
Hey, Tahei!

439
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,634
Damn it!

440
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,951
Where did you hide this?

441
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,797
You're so suspicious.
That's just ñrewood.

442
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,753
It's a bad idea to take the girl.
She'll slow us down.

443
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,910
What if she blabs?

444
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,391
- She's mute. Don't worry.
- Mute?

445
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,511
Stop!

446
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,272
This will be an easy border to cross.

447
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,189
Wait.

448
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,872
Better be cautious.

449
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,280
Don't move till I come back.

450
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,278
If we want to get rid of him,
now's our chance.

451
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,113
Don't worry. She's mute.

452
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,078
She's mute but she can hear.

453
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,878
Stupid.

454
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,749
A mute can't speak
because she's deaf.

455
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,871
This is where we have to think.

456
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,240
He's sly, so we can't trust him
even if we cross into Hayakawa.

457
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,591
He'll cheat us.

458
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,796
Let's run away.

459
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,270
What about his load?

460
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,399
We can't carry it.

461
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,234
We'll take his horse.

462
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,318
There's no time to argue.

463
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,960
Let's tell her
we're taking the horses for a drink.

464
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,834
Fool! They're not drinking sake.

465
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,633
Hurry!

466
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,709
What are you doing?

467
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,513
Where are the horses?

468
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,833
What shall we do?

469
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,154
Princess!

470
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,714
Princess!

471
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,920
It's frustrating to be a mute.
All I can do is watch.

472
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,190
The two of them?

473
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,831
Out of greed, they took the horses.

474
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,069
Then the enemy spotted them.
Fine allies.

475
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,274
You!

476
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,555
We can't cross that river.

477
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,315
There's a ñring squad
on the other side.

478
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,240
I know your game!

479
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,437
Take the gold and get lost!

480
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,392
He's gone.

481
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,993
He's not here.

482
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,590
Boss!

483
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,479
Where are you, boss?

484
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,159
There he is.

485
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,749
Boss, the other side
is lined with Yamana soldiers.

486
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,639
What would you do?

487
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,793
What do I care?

488
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,720
What are you doing?

489
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,678
Wait and see at the fortress?

490
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,510
Shut up! Go away!

491
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,715
Please, take us with you.

492
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,151
We promise to behave.

493
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,998
What's that?

494
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,397
The Yamana found it!

495
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,670
What will we do?

496
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,433
We're leaving.

497
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,433
Which way?

498
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,874
Straight ahead.

499
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,474
You're joking!

500
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,080
Leave it to me. I have a plan.

501
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,118
Your pass?

502
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,633
Your pass!

503
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,749
Wait!

504
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,758
Boss!

505
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,634
Next!

506
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,954
Your pass.

507
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,156
What's your problem?

508
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,674
I picked up something.

509
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,320
What? It's just a piece of wood.

510
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,110
I found it at Mt. Suribachi.

511
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,350
He found this.

512
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,269
Gold!

513
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,314
The Akizuki crest!

514
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,872
You really found it at Mt. Suribachi?

515
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,636
Bring me my horse!

516
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,309
- That gold is mine. Give it back.
- No.

517
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,390
Give me the gold or a reward.

518
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,315
Shut up.

519
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,834
Get lost.

520
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,640
Give me a reward. I won't move!

521
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,280
You bastard!

522
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,195
A reward! Give me a reward!

523
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,759
A reward!

524
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,193
Greedy!

525
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,797
Two or three loaded horses,
several men and a girl.

526
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,315
If you see such a group,
arrest them immediately.

527
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,598
There are signs that
Princess Yuki's party has been here.

528
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,275
But she was beheaded.

529
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,269
Using a double is nothing new.

530
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,118
You also saw the smoke rise
on the mountain.

531
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,430
That was Akizuki's hidden fortress.

532
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,797
It was guarded by an old soldier
and two others.

533
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,270
They could have escaped.

534
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,433
Instead, they burned the fortress
and fought to the end.

535
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,310
It appears they wanted to signal
and gain time for others to escape.

536
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:56,831
The princess and a few men
escaped with the gold for sure.

537
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,992
There are traces on the road.

538
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:05,439
Don't slack off. Catch them
and you will be rewarded.

539
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,749
Boss.

540
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,837
Are you okay, boss?

541
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,879
Let's take a back road.

542
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,714
Stop sneaking around.
It invites suspicion.

543
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,393
But...

544
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,153
What are you doing?

545
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,958
We're staying here tonight.

546
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,469
Here?

547
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:01,270
You've got to be kidding me.
Let's hurry through the night.

548
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,150
It's a long way. Let's not push it.

549
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,914
Then let's camp out.

550
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:15,111
Hide a stone among stones
and a man among men.

551
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,351
Where will we hide the gold?

552
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,313
Leave it out in the open.

553
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,399
<i>You 're so slow!</i>

554
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,518
<i>Pay attention and bring some water!</i>

555
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,190
Always crying,
but you refuse to take johns.

556
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,119
You were a lousy deal.

557
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,032
Where did you get her?

558
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,679
In Akizuki.

559
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,559
Lose a war
and plenty of women go on sale.

560
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,675
How much?

561
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,115
Five silver pieces. Want her?

562
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,551
Idiot! I'm not a dog like you!

563
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,397
You're blufñng.

564
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,914
No, sorry.

565
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,877
Look here.

566
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,073
Look.

567
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:06,838
Average-looking, but excellent body.

568
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,718
How about it?

569
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,472
For one silver piece,
she's yours for the night.

570
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,118
What's the use of buying a woman
who won't take customers?

571
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,515
How much is she?

572
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,919
She's a looker!

573
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,760
She's not one of yours?

574
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,592
I'll buy her.
Who does she belong to?

575
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,153
Whose girl is she?

576
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,954
I'll buy her!
I'll buy her for a piece of gold!

577
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,110
<i>Enough/.</i>

578
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,799
- She's a mute.
- Mute?

579
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,271
That's too bad. I'll pass.

580
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,431
Who owns the horse outside?

581
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,999
Is it yours?

582
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,799
Do you want to sell her to me?
I'll give you whatever you want.

583
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,190
But my load...

584
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,514
She's too good for a packhorse.

585
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,513
Five silver pieces.

586
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,671
You can buy ñve horses.

587
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,394
Boss, what shall we do?

588
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,715
Two horses aren't enough
for everything.

589
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,391
It's hard to ñnd another one.

590
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,914
Damn, this really stinks!

591
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,680
There's no time for girls.

592
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,751
Buy that girl back.

593
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,349
Icannot.

594
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:58,756
Why not? I am the Princess of Akizuki.

595
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,639
I can't bear to see
one of our own in trouble.

596
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,473
No, you're the one in trouble.

597
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,238
Your kindness will be your downfall.

598
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,119
I don't care.

599
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,389
Buy her back.

600
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,995
No!

601
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,235
You cannot make
my heart mute too!

602
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,430
A cart was a bad idea.

603
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,274
We're the horses now.

604
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,120
And we've even taken in that girl.

605
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,638
Stop following us. Go away.

606
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,270
Go back to Akizuki.

607
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,997
Don't stop! Keep going!

608
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,992
Have you seen four people,
three horses and a girl?

609
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:33,159
If you do,
report them immediately.

610
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,038
It went well. We're lucky.

611
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:58,832
Who said a cart was a bad idea?

612
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,998
You were grumbling about the girl.

613
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:10,033
But those men are stupid.
Why not check the wood?

614
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,040
What shall we do now?

615
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,913
Keep calm!

616
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,033
Put it down!

617
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,437
Report them!

618
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,915
Run! Wait on the hill!

619
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,393
Damn you!

620
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,954
Why, if it isn't Rokurota Makabe!

621
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:26,356
Hey, Hyoe Tadokoro!

622
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,835
Stand aside!
You're no match for him!

623
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,153
A rare meeting.

624
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,959
I regret not meeting you
on the battleñeld this time around.

625
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,510
I regret it too.

626
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,110
How about a duel?

627
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,030
With pleasure!

628
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,838
With what? A spear?

629
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,909
Sounds good.

630
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,518
All of them are inferior,
but choose one.

631
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,755
I lost!

632
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,311
Wait!

633
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,197
We will meet again.

634
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,433
Rokurota!

635
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:47,950
Rokurota!

636
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,880
<i>/-'/rewood? What about firewood?</i>

637
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,998
<i>Apparently there's gold
hidden in the wood.</i>

638
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,272
They're hiding here with all that.

639
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:37,876
Four of them.
One girl with three men.

640
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,913
She's Princess Yuki from Akizuki.

641
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,471
The reward is
20 pieces of gold for her.

642
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,473
Five pieces just for information.

643
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:51,316
Don't jump the gun.
It won't be easy.

644
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:57,238
A strong general,
Rokurota Makabe, is with her.

645
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,633
It's cold!

646
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,954
It's been three days now.

647
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,274
- More rain. More rain.
- What?

648
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,632
We can't move even if it stops.

649
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:45,593
We go out there
and we'll get beheaded.

650
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,469
You madman!
Are you glad to be beheaded?

651
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,238
Why not?

652
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,873
It's better than putting up with this!

653
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,715
Then give up the gold and get lost.

654
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,758
Good idea.

655
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,639
I'm leaving.

656
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,951
But I'm taking all I can carry.

657
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,872
I'll be set for life.

658
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,512
I'm leaving too.

659
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,510
Great.

660
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,955
What's left is all mine.

661
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:36,909
Take what you want and beat it.

662
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,029
But we're not getting anywhere.

663
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,679
Where are you going?

664
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:04,915
I'm going to ñnd something
to put the gold in.

665
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:26,678
Whoever draws the shorter one
disappears for a while.

666
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,672
He's late.

667
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,913
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

668
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,030
What's going on?
Everyone's carrying wood.

669
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,635
I know! It's the Fire Festival.

670
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:36,432
Haven't you heard
of the Yamana Fire Festival,

671
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,433
where the villagers dance
around a bonfnre?

672
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:41,438
We lucked out!

673
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,752
They're going in our direction.
If we join the crowd...

674
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,071
I don't get it.

675
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,629
Why do we have
to patrol a Fire Festival?

676
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:07,040
Look. There's a lot of wood
at the festival.

677
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:12,798
The Akizuki clan may hide here
with their gold hidden in ñrewood.

678
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:15,473
What's this?

679
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,360
- What's wrong?
- We'll push together.

680
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,991
There's too much wood to check.

681
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,436
We'll inspect the suspicious ones...

682
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,598
who stray from the crowd.

683
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,437
- Where is everyone?
- At the festival.

684
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,591
Marching with the crowd.

685
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:14,994
<i>The life of a man.</i>

686
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:22,598
<i>Bum it in the fire.</i>

687
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:31,317
<i>The life of an insect.</i>

688
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:38,117
<i>Throw it into the fire.</i>

689
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:50,155
<i>When you rea//ze.</i>

690
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:58,151
<i>The world is dark.</i>

691
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:07,800
<i>Life is just a dream.</i>

692
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:18,151
<i>Løse yourself.</i>

693
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:46,112
Burn it!
Throw the cart into the ñre!

694
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,509
No!

695
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:53,555
Don't be stingy, fool!

696
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,954
No!

697
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,952
They're suspicious.

698
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,750
Move!

699
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,319
Burn it!

700
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:05,997
- Make room!
- Here we go!

701
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,799
No, don't!

702
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:20,829
Dance!

703
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:50,191
That's enough. Let's pack it up.

704
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:52,237
But, boss, there's more.

705
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:54,114
Don't be greedy.

706
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:58,074
There's no point
taking more than we can carry.

707
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:02,634
You two carry 30 <i>kan</i> each.

708
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:06,393
I'll carry 40.
With the two women, that's 20 more.

709
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,835
What? I can carry 40 kan too.

710
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,758
I'll carry 50 kan.

711
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:53,799
Hurry UP!

712
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,077
It's such a shame to leave that gold.

713
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:50,398
Go back?

714
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:00,520
Where are you going?

715
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,472
No more.

716
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,152
What are you looking for?

717
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,754
<i>He/p/.</i>

718
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,160
Boss, help us!

719
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:22,674
If you want to live,
pick up your load.

720
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,631
Follow me!

721
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:37,478
Matashichi!

722
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:27,591
Hurry up! We can cross
the mountain overnight.

723
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,391
It's hard. I'd rather be dead.

724
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:20,600
Then die.

725
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,235
What?

726
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,911
Boss!

727
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,679
Calm down!

728
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,479
Don't stand up!

729
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,192
Listen! I'll run and distract them.
Escape while you can.

730
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,193
Hey!

731
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:47,676
We're done for! Let's run!

732
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:50,992
Farewell!

733
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,591
Did you say something?

734
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:12,673
I'm not worth it.

735
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:16,996
Leave me and go!

736
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:46,951
This is the end.

737
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,872
If we get caught, they'll kill us.

738
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,674
Not if we don't have any gold.

739
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:01,077
We'll turn them in.

740
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:05,519
You're right.
Maybe we'll even get a reward.

741
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,869
Idiot!

742
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:10,755
They'll shoot us if we're not careful.

743
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:18,918
I'm sure Yamana's increasing
the patrols at the Hayakawa border.

744
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:21,996
We can report them there.

745
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,709
Princess!

746
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:20,635
Your Highness! Hayakawa!

747
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:41,518
Are you joking?
We got them and their gold long ago.

748
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:43,512
Go home, fools.

749
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:45,917
Let's drink up!

750
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:21,873
Look carefully!

751
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:25,318
You won't see 200 gold pieces again!

752
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,234
Wait.

753
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,357
I'd rather see Princess Yuki!

754
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,591
She's a sight for sore eyes.

755
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:39,199
To think she'll be
beheaded tomorrow...

756
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:42,390
Stay back!

757
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:44,391
Just a glance.

758
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:48,994
<i>Let me through/.</i>

759
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:55,835
<i>Tadokoro here to ident/á/ them.</i>

760
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:18,758
Hyoe Tadokoro!

761
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,238
What happened to you?

762
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,633
Where did you get that scar?

763
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:03,673
You've changed.

764
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:08,474
Naturally.

765
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,110
Tell me what happened.

766
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:17,673
We're on opposite sides,
but we're true friends.

767
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,595
Fiends?

768
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:24,311
Then why did you let me survive
the shame of my defeat?

769
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,356
To defeat an enemy yet let him live
may seem kind,

770
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:31,398
but it's cruel.

771
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:34,200
Look at me. Look!

772
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,155
My lord shamed me before everyone.

773
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:40,200
See the scar left
by the relentless beating?

774
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,273
Curse you!

775
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:44,510
Fool!

776
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:48,274
So this is the great Hyoe Tadokoro?

777
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:54,999
What you make
of another's kindness is up to you.

778
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:59,032
As is the lord,
so is the retainer.

779
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:04,830
To punish you so
for losing to an enemy...

780
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:08,993
Even I would not dare such a thing.

781
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,798
I'm the princess! It's me!

782
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,189
That's enough!

783
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:17,235
I appreciate your loyalty,
but this is it.

784
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:22,155
I want to die with dignity.

785
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:27,351
Your Highness, your servant Rokurota
cannot apologize enough.

786
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:33,474
You endured so much,
and it was all in vain.

787
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:35,551
You're wrong, Rokurota.

788
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:38,871
I have enjoyed the journey.

789
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:44,592
The happiness of these days

790
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,036
I would have never known
living in the castle.

791
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:52,229
I've seen people as they are,
without pretense.

792
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:54,957
I've seen their beauty...

793
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:58,237
and their ugliness...

794
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,711
with my own eyes.

795
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:07,555
Rokurota, I thank you.

796
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:13,275
I can now die without regret.

797
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,519
Your Highness!

798
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:18,034
Rokurota.

799
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:23,440
That Fire Festival was wonderful.

800
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:28,595
That song has stayed with me.

801
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:40,240
<i>The life of a man.</i>

802
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:53,389
<i>Bum it in the fire.</i>

803
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:05,240
<i>The life of an insect.</i>

804
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:15,117
<i>Throw it into the fire.</i>

805
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:28,360
<i>When you rea//ze.</i>

806
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:40,279
<i>The world is dark.</i>

807
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:51,874
<i>Life is just a dream.</i>

808
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:55,676
<i>Løse yourself.</i>

809
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:11,269
<i>The life of a man.</i>

810
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:19,713
<i>Bum it in the fire.</i>

811
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,033
Let's burn it!

812
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,478
Turn the horses around!

813
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,992
Turn them around, I said!

814
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:51,673
He's mad!

815
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,509
Get them!

816
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:29,514
Hurry, Rokurota!
Take the princess!

817
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,633
Let go!

818
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,356
She is a great leader.
Serve her well.

819
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:47,550
Hyoeg.

820
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:52,439
Don't die in vain!
If you wish, follow us!

821
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:59,313
Come!

822
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:02,319
Very well!

823
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:33,912
Forgive this traitor!

824
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:47,429
Damn.

825
02:11:48,640 --> 02:11:52,599
When I got to Hayakawa
with the gold,

826
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:56,031
I imagined I'd be so happy.

827
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:05,599
We're lucky to have our heads.

828
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:10,710
Let's stay friends.

829
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:16,034
We risked death together.

830
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:19,870
We'll stay friends back in the village.

831
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:44,239
Stray horses.

832
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:00,959
Gold!

833
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:20,315
This is all mine.

834
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:23,233
What? Give me one of them.

835
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,592
I found them ñrst.

836
02:13:25,680 --> 02:13:28,035
You're greedy.

837
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:31,989
You said we should
split everything ñfty-ñfty.

838
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:34,117
That was then. This is now!

839
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,590
You shithead!

840
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,439
You.

841
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,832
Are you from the Akizuki clan?

842
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,915
No, we're just peasants.

843
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:49,913
I don't get it.
Peasants with all this gold?

844
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:56,119
Arrest them!

845
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:14,718
Let's stay friends in heaven too.

846
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:42,792
<i>Matashich/Z/ Tahe/Z/.</i>

847
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:44,314
<i>Look up/.</i>

848
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:55,720
What? It's me.

849
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:57,598
No wonder.

850
02:15:58,600 --> 02:16:00,830
Even I didn't recognize you.

851
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:04,276
Your armor becomes you.

852
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:08,718
Rokurota Makabe.

853
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:13,634
You look even more handsome.

854
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:27,278
You don't recognize
your Princess Yuki?

855
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:34,320
The mute. The mute girl.

856
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,435
<i>Matashichi.</i>

857
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:17,315
Tahei.

858
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:22,636
You two went through a lot for us.

859
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:29,631
However, that gold is
indispensable funds to restore Akizuki.

860
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:34,752
Not I, not even
the princess, can take it.

861
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:39,557
I hope you will be
satisñed with this.

862
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:42,752
Here.

863
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:47,158
Split it fairly.

864
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:49,955
No ñghting.

865
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:22,676
You keep this.

866
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:25,511
No, you keep it.

867
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,349
But...

868
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:29,591
Don't worry about it.

867
02:18:30,300 --> 02:18:54,300
