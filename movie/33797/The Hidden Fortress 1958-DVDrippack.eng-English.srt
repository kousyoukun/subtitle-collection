7
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:20,175
Stay away from me!

8
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:21,908
You stink of dead bodies.

9
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:24,708
Give it up.
We both smell of corpses.

10
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:26,342
And it's all your fault!

11
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:34,276
Your smell makes me want to puke.

12
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:37,643
Though shitworms can't smell shit.

13
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,610
What?

14
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,910
You're a shitworm.
You make me sick.

15
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,811
And you thought we'd make
a fortune at the war.

16
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:54,578
What's funny, you idiot!

17
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:57,578
It's all funny!

18
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,645
First, we arrived late to the war.

19
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:05,379
Then they mistook us for
the defeated side

20
00:02:05,513 --> 00:02:07,379
and forced us to bury the dead.

21
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:14,013
We finally escaped and now it's
been 2 days we've only had water.

22
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:20,681
But the funniest thing is
your foolish cry baby face.

23
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:09,586
Let's go home.

24
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:13,419
Don't you have any pride?

25
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:17,920
We've even been stripped
of the arms we sold our homes for.

26
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,687
We can't go home like this.

27
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,987
Then take it off this dead guy.

28
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:27,887
Even if I'm desperate,
I'm not a thief.

29
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,854
Do what you want. I'm going!

30
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:33,888
Go. I'll come home after
I make a buck.

31
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:35,755
Don't come crying to me then.

32
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:39,355
Get caught again
and be a gravedigger.

33
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:42,456
Fool! Go away!

34
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:47,823
It'll be a blessing to see you go,
you shitworm.

35
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:10,825
We can't cross the border
from this road.

36
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:12,992
It's a Yamana check station.

37
00:04:13,392 --> 00:04:15,926
Not even a mouse could pass
through those barricades.

38
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:31,460
If they find us, we're dead.

39
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:47,629
What now?

40
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:54,829
Unless a fog breaks out,
we can't move.

41
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,331
What does it say up there?

42
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:15,465
It's a notice about a reward
for 10 pieces of gold.

43
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,265
Read it to me.

44
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:23,099
"Wanted. Princess Yuki of Akizuki."

45
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,633
"A reward of ten ryo
for her capture."

46
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:31,700
"Three ryo for information
of her whereabouts."

47
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,334
"By order of the Lord of Yamana."

48
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:47,935
- Move!
- Walk!

49
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,970
I'm not one of them.

50
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:25,839
I'm thankful for the fog
but I can't see anything.

51
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,572
Which way is Hayakawa?

52
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,506
Shut up and follow me!

53
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,541
Who is it?

54
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:15,377
Not grave digging again.

55
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:32,379
Matashichi!

56
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,150
Listen!

57
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:26,517
There is 200 kan of pure gold
hidden in this castle.

58
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:31,018
Until you find it, you're no
longer men but moles!

59
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:35,518
So dig! Dig until you drop, moles!

60
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,996
Matashichi, this is hell.

61
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,430
It's the end!

62
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:34,497
If we're going to die,
let's die together.

63
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:15,801
That way!

64
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:28,736
Thieves! Rice thieves!

65
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:35,203
What shall we do now?

66
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,970
Find the Princess.

67
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:41,603
The Princess?

68
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:44,037
The sole survivor
of the Akizuki clan.

69
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,104
I think the reward on her head
is ten ryo.

70
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:50,038
Ten pieces of gold?

71
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:52,605
Informers get three.

72
00:11:53,571 --> 00:11:54,471
Three pieces of gold?

73
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:01,272
It's no good. That's only a dream.

74
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:04,372
If we get greedy and get caught,
we're done for.

75
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,140
I guess we'd better go home.

76
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:13,007
But how will we cross the border?

77
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:16,107
Bang and we're dead.

78
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,708
Let's eat.

79
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,208
I can't think on an empty stomach.

80
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,408
Not ready.

81
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,375
These don't burn at all.

82
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,078
What's this?

83
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:11,813
Why, it's gold!

84
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,846
You're right! It's gold!

85
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,047
But... a piece of gold...
inside a stick?

86
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:32,648
I've heard of a rich man hiding
gold in the pillars of his home, but...

87
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,415
What's this? An insignia!

88
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,015
Looks like a crescent.

89
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:40,615
The crescent is the Akizuki crest!

90
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:44,449
That's the reserve gold they were
digging for in the castle.

91
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:07,051
You made the fire -
where did you get the wood?

92
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,453
Let's split up and look.

93
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,187
I'll go this way.
You go over there to the marsh.

94
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:16,958
The same piece!

95
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,192
What are you doing?

96
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,592
One's mine!

97
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,092
I found both!

98
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:23,492
I found the stick first.

99
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:24,526
I threw it!

100
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:25,926
I picked up the gold!

101
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,326
Liar! I'm the one who
noticed it was gold.

102
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:33,793
- Let's go back.
- Back?

103
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,527
There must be more.

104
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,127
If someone else notices it,
we're screwed.

105
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:47,761
He's following us.

106
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:50,495
Watch out. Maybe he's a bandit.

107
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:52,629
He's not a bandit. He has no sword.

108
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:55,796
You can't be sure.
He may work for one.

109
00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:11,330
He stopped following us.

110
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:13,097
Let's go back.

111
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:17,464
No, better be careful.

112
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:22,332
It's late, anyway.
It won't hurt to wait one night.

113
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,565
It's a big job.
Better safe than sorry.

114
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:45,367
We haven't seen that guy since,
so maybe we didn't need to worry.

115
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:53,868
Probably a lumberjack
or a charcoal maker.

116
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:56,935
So, let's get this straight now.

117
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:00,235
What?

118
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:05,036
Don't play dumb.
How to split up the gold.

119
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:09,303
Let's be fair and divide it equally.

120
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,003
You don't like it?

121
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:19,004
- But I...
- Then it's settled! All right?

122
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:24,638
Let's sleep.

123
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:29,272
Sleep tight, and let's dream
of mountains of gold.

124
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:02,542
Hey!

125
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:07,175
Good eve...

126
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:15,976
Hey!

127
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:22,177
Cold, isn't it?

128
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:51,513
What are you doing here
in the mountain?

129
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,047
How about you?

130
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,981
- Us? We intend to cross the border.
- The border?

131
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:05,448
- We want to go to Hayakawa.
- Hayakawa?

132
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:08,048
But beyond the mountains
it's Yamana.

133
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:14,982
Yes... but you see...

134
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:22,116
to go to Hayakawa...

135
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:24,216
This is Hayakawa.

136
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:29,017
And this is Akizuki

137
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,450
where we are now.

138
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:37,951
This is... Yamana.

139
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:45,452
We want to go from Akizuki
to Hayakawa.

140
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:49,986
But the border is guarded
by Yamana soldiers.

141
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:57,686
So, we'll cross first to Yamana.

142
00:19:57,886 --> 00:20:01,153
And then slip into Hayakawa.

143
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:02,687
See...

144
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,987
There's no way that survivors
of the Akizuki clan

145
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:09,454
would go to Yamana,
the enemy territory.

146
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:15,588
So the border between Akizuki
and Yamana should be open.

147
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:17,555
That's right.

148
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:21,622
The Hayakawa-Yamana border
must be

149
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:26,823
easier to cross than
the Akizuki-Hayakawa border.

150
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,923
Anyway, we're just peasants.

151
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:34,257
Even if anything happened,
we'd still make it.

152
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:46,858
All right. I've made up my mind.

153
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:51,058
Going through Yamana
is a good idea.

154
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:55,992
The 200 gold pieces are useless
here, but with three men

155
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:58,026
and three horses,
we can carry it out.

156
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:05,327
200 gold pieces?
What are you talking about?

157
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:07,693
Be honest.

158
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:40,163
I've got an eye on that place.

159
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:14,533
- Don't kick the stones.
- You stop grabbing my leg.

160
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:29,874
What now?

161
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:32,408
What is he doing?

162
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,008
He's not here.

163
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:41,142
Where did he go?

164
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:44,742
That guy can't be trusted.

165
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,143
What is this place?

166
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:01,544
It's what they call
a hidden fortress.

167
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:04,144
A hidden fortress?
The Akizuki one.

168
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,911
Look. You can see all of Yamana.

169
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:12,445
But...

170
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:16,012
For a fortress,
it's strangely empty.

171
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:19,779
Someone's here!

172
00:24:25,613 --> 00:24:26,780
What are you doing?

173
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,647
Oh, it's that guy.

174
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:36,981
Hey. Come down quickly.

175
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:55,750
How did you get down there?

176
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:56,983
What are your names?

177
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,817
I'm Matashichi.

178
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,183
I'm Tahei.

179
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:02,250
Matashichi, put the rice down.

180
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:04,784
Tahei, you put the rice in the pot.

181
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:07,984
Hurry up!

182
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:16,152
Where's the water? I need
a drink before the food.

183
00:25:16,852 --> 00:25:18,752
Me too. I can't even spit anymore.

184
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,852
Hey. What's your name?

185
00:25:25,453 --> 00:25:29,220
Me? I'm Rokurota Makabe.

186
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,087
Rokurota Makabe?
I've heard that name before.

187
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,820
Makabe...

188
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:39,387
Rokurota Makabe...

189
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:44,521
Get out of here. Rokurota Makabe

190
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:47,455
is a legendary Akizuki
samurai general.

191
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:51,755
You take us for fools.

192
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,224
We shouldn't put up with this.

193
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:20,258
Hey. Stop fooling around. You're no
general, you're just a bully.

194
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:23,658
What's with the big attitude?

195
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,926
Don't make fun of us. Damn you.

196
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:52,328
What?

197
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:00,262
That wasn't very nice.

198
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,662
You could have told us if
there was a secret passageway.

199
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:08,029
We've been partners
since last night.

200
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:11,163
Besides, just because you found
this place first,

201
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,763
doesn't mean you're the boss.

202
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:21,764
Let's decide now how
we're going to divvy up.

203
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:25,331
Fair and square, we share it
in three equal parts. Deal?

204
00:27:25,898 --> 00:27:26,765
Here's the water.

205
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:54,134
Excellent.

206
00:28:05,035 --> 00:28:09,602
This is some fortress that
they have water like this.

207
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:26,737
Don't bother.
I already went through there.

208
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:28,504
Just prepare the rice.

209
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:31,705
Shut up. I can't take it anymore.
You can stuff your orders.

210
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:33,838
You want to fight?

211
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:35,438
Don't hold back. Do him in.

212
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:01,141
Cook the rice.

213
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:10,442
It's a girl.

214
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:28,644
Where is she? Who is she?

215
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:32,511
I don't know. She's really quick
though. She's already gone.

216
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:39,211
Look. She's mine, OK? I'll kill you
if you go near her.

217
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,945
Cook and then it's work.

218
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:46,112
What are you doing?

219
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:38,451
Don't touch me, fool!
It's uncomfortable enough.

220
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:42,184
It's your face that
makes me uncomfortable.

221
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:46,585
Leave my face alone.

222
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:53,385
I hate the way you blink
all the time.

223
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:56,919
There you go again.

224
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,020
Shut up. Put your filthy teeth away.

225
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:08,053
Show them to me once more
and I'll bash them in.

226
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:24,055
I'm quitting! This is idiotic!
I dig and dig and nothing!

227
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:26,689
It's his fault.

228
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:34,856
Dammit. Gone again.

229
00:31:39,657 --> 00:31:44,057
He's on his high horse
watching us do all the work.

230
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,824
Right. He's probably running
around looking for that girl.

231
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:53,258
Maybe he already found a place
and is sleeping with her.

232
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:58,192
We agreed to split everything in
three. The girl should be the same.

233
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,759
That bully is not just anyone.

234
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:02,992
I can't figure out what he's up to.

235
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:07,993
He may already have found the 200
pieces of gold and moved them.

236
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:13,027
That's very likely. I'm sure of it.

237
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:19,694
That means he's hiding the gold
right now.

238
00:32:20,527 --> 00:32:22,594
So if he's not in this fortress...

239
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:25,495
Look!

240
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:27,361
That spring is fishy.

241
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:32,095
Pretending like he's already
checked it out... damn.

242
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,034
Where do you live?

243
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:27,901
Hey, lady, don't be mad.

244
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:43,775
What are you doing?

245
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:47,142
Shut up! I told you I'd kill you
if you touched her!

246
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:53,376
Wait, boss. It's not fair.

247
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,176
Look. The girl dropped this.

248
00:34:57,976 --> 00:35:01,443
Don't go behind our back.
She's worth 10 ryo.

249
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:03,977
This does not belong
to a country girl.

250
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:07,644
Maybe you think she's the
Akizuki princess.

251
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:11,211
You're right.

252
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,611
That comb does belong
to Princess Yuki.

253
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,378
But now it belongs to me.
Give it back.

254
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:21,879
I took it from the Princess
and gave it to her.

255
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:22,912
What?

256
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,812
I don't lie.

257
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:26,279
Then where is Princess Yuki?

258
00:35:27,246 --> 00:35:28,513
I captured her and handed her
over to the Yamana authorities.

259
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:32,147
Careful. I think he's full of crap.

260
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,247
Here's the reward of 10 ryo.
Still think it's a lie?

261
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,215
Tell me. Where did Matashichi go?

262
00:35:54,782 --> 00:35:55,582
I don't know.

263
00:35:57,582 --> 00:35:59,283
What are you plotting? Tell me!

264
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,383
To... to the town.

265
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,683
To do what?

266
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,650
He went to report.

267
00:36:05,883 --> 00:36:07,017
Report who?

268
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:10,117
- The princess, of course.
- The princess?

269
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:18,918
We're not as stupid as you think.

270
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:23,152
You thought you had fooled us
but we're not that gullible.

271
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:25,852
I know your game.

272
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:33,119
Your reward money is just
a part of the hidden gold.

273
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,786
You're greedy on top of it.

274
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,753
You want to capture
the princess yourself

275
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:41,720
so you can have all the reward.

276
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,720
It won't go so smoothly.

277
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:46,621
I made a mistake
by relying on scum.

278
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:49,488
You think you're better, scum?

279
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:57,488
Matashichi, did you see
the officers?

280
00:36:57,722 --> 00:37:00,355
Fool. Do you think
I'd be back so soon?

281
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:04,489
It's the talk of town already.
The princess was captured

282
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,556
a while back and
she was beheaded yesterday.

283
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:28,091
Boss, we're sorry we doubted you.

284
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:40,899
It's Rokurota Makabe.

285
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,199
Enter.

286
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:53,833
Any news?

287
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,300
Kofuyu served her duty.

288
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:03,534
The enemy will relax
their guard now.

289
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:06,568
Now is our chance to escape.

290
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:10,235
What happened to Kofuyu?

291
00:39:11,702 --> 00:39:14,769
As a dutiful servant, my sister went
in place of your Highness.

292
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:18,969
This assures the safety
of your Highness.

293
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:20,503
Rokurota!

294
00:39:21,503 --> 00:39:21,903
Fool!

295
00:39:22,003 --> 00:39:23,836
What are you saying your Highness?

296
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:29,837
Kofuyu was 16... I am 16. What
difference is there in our souls?

297
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:35,471
It is our duty as servants.
Kofuyu was honored...

298
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:40,405
Lies! If I were Kofuyu,
I would curse this Princess.

299
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:44,805
Your words are too harsh.
Rokurota has no leg to stand on.

300
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:45,939
Be quiet!

301
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:50,972
I don't even want to see your face!

302
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:55,206
Your nobility that doesn't
even shed a tear

303
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,473
when you've killed your sister.

304
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:01,674
I hate it!

305
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:03,407
I hate it!

306
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:15,608
I don't know what to do with her
Highness. It's the Lord's fault.

307
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:18,409
Even if he was lacking an heir,

308
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,809
it was cruel to raise her Highness
like a boy.

309
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:25,209
Say right and she'll go left,
say left and she'll go right.

310
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:31,477
And though she is a girl,
she has never shown me a tear.

311
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:33,577
The same
with her present behavior.

312
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:38,344
Insensitive to your pain of having
sacrificed your sister, she...

313
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,111
She herself does not shed a tear,
but she still criticizes you.

314
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,078
It's too much.

315
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,111
Her Highness is the real sacrifice.

316
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,312
Her suffering of having to rebuild
the Akizuki clan...

317
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:31,916
The Yamana's are here!

318
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,616
There are horses at the spring.

319
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,521
This is good, to fool the Yamana's
by going through enemy lines.

320
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:28,522
This was the peasants' idea.

321
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:32,689
Depending on their answers,
I was ready to kill them.

322
00:42:32,822 --> 00:42:36,122
But hearing their plan to go
through Yamana to Hayakawa,

323
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:37,156
I was stunned.

324
00:42:37,256 --> 00:42:39,223
Sometimes even moss can be smart...

325
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:45,323
How long can we rely on them?

326
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:47,490
We can rely on their greed.

327
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,224
Make them carry gold and
they'll put up with anything.

328
00:42:51,624 --> 00:42:53,291
That takes care of the gold.

329
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:59,291
But we cannot take a chance
with the Princess.

330
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,825
But staying here is not safe either.

331
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:06,425
This hidden fortress will soon
be discovered by the Yamana's too.

332
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:10,859
And our deal with Lord Hayakawa
may not last either.

333
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:12,893
Understood.

334
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:17,226
But what shall we do
with the Princess?

335
00:43:21,794 --> 00:43:24,027
We can disguise her looks,
but not her class.

336
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:27,927
And her speech...

337
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:32,161
Her Highness
will have to be a mute.

338
00:43:32,295 --> 00:43:35,995
A mute... isn't there any other way?

339
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:37,928
There isn't.

340
00:43:38,695 --> 00:43:41,796
I don't know if the Princess
would agree.

341
00:43:46,063 --> 00:43:47,229
Leave it to me.

342
00:43:50,563 --> 00:43:51,563
I hadn't ridden in a long time.

343
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,297
She runs fast. She's too good
to be a packhorse.

344
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:58,197
Just in case you need to ride.

345
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:01,631
So we finally pass
through enemy lines.

346
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:08,565
- Speaking of which, could you play mute?
- Mute?

347
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:12,265
I'm sure you couldn't do it.

348
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,899
To go through Yamana, my greatest
concern is your speech.

349
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,500
We were discussing
you could be a mute...

350
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:24,633
But I think it's impossible.

351
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,234
I was captured once and
had to pretend to be a mute.

352
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:33,034
It was agony.

353
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,734
Your Highness couldn't take it.

354
00:44:44,002 --> 00:44:44,935
I'm not biting.

355
00:44:46,835 --> 00:44:48,969
When you say right, I say left.

356
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:53,936
I'm a handful.

357
00:44:54,703 --> 00:44:58,737
Let me use reverse psychology.

358
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,703
Princess.

359
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:00,870
All right.

360
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:10,671
This once I will let you fool me.
Otherwise your plan will be foiled.

361
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:16,772
Your noble face again.

362
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:20,005
If you need anything, tell me now.

363
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:23,572
Once I'm a mute,
I'm not talking until Hayakawa.

364
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:39,907
We have to tell him.

365
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,741
The bully? Never mind him.

366
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:49,375
Idiot, shut up. We'll get caught.

367
00:46:08,144 --> 00:46:08,877
Where are you going?

368
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,111
Boss, run! The Yamana soldiers
have found us.

369
00:46:13,511 --> 00:46:16,544
There were horses by the spring.

370
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,845
Idiots. I stole those.

371
00:46:25,012 --> 00:46:27,145
We can't carry 200 pieces
of gold without them.

372
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:28,146
Gold?

373
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:31,079
We'll climb down today.

374
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:33,779
Where is the gold?

375
00:46:44,914 --> 00:46:47,481
Hey. Where is the gold?

376
00:46:48,314 --> 00:46:50,614
Don't hold out on us. Come on.

377
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:58,582
I knew it!

378
00:47:01,315 --> 00:47:02,882
Don't fool around with us.

379
00:47:03,249 --> 00:47:05,316
You said you had already gone
through there.

380
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:07,616
Why did you make us dig
at the fortress?

381
00:47:08,483 --> 00:47:09,483
I was testing you.

382
00:47:10,716 --> 00:47:13,783
We'll need a lot of backbone
on the road. You did well.

383
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:17,017
Lift the gold out of the water
and onto the horses.

384
00:47:17,517 --> 00:47:18,951
The three of us will carry the rest.

385
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:29,752
Gold!

386
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:32,852
Leave the gold in the wood.

387
00:48:09,122 --> 00:48:09,889
Dammit.

388
00:48:15,356 --> 00:48:16,290
Where did you hide this?

389
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,490
You're so suspicious.
That's just firewood.

390
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:26,891
It's a bad idea to take the girl.
She'll slow us down.

391
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:31,124
What if she blabs...

392
00:48:32,091 --> 00:48:34,225
- She's mute. Don't worry.
- Mute?

393
00:49:42,598 --> 00:49:44,632
This will be an easy border
to cross.

394
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:46,165
Wait.

395
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:49,732
Better be cautious.

396
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,266
Don't move 'til I come back.

397
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,901
If we want to get rid of him,
now's our chance.

398
00:50:12,335 --> 00:50:13,435
Don't worry. She's mute.

399
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:15,035
She's mute but she can hear.

400
00:50:15,435 --> 00:50:19,302
Stupid. A mute can't speak
because she's deaf.

401
00:50:23,002 --> 00:50:24,036
This is where we have to think.

402
00:50:24,736 --> 00:50:28,336
He's sly so we can't trust him even
if we cross into Hayakawa.

403
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:30,136
He'll cheat us.

404
00:50:31,603 --> 00:50:32,737
Let's run away.

405
00:50:33,403 --> 00:50:34,937
What about his load?

406
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,437
We can't carry it.
We'll take his horse.

407
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:47,171
There's no time to argue.

408
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:50,272
Let's tell her we're taking
the horses for a drink.

409
00:50:58,473 --> 00:50:59,773
Fool. They're not drinking sake.

410
00:52:36,282 --> 00:52:37,649
What are you doing?

411
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:08,786
Where are the horses?

412
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:18,453
What shall we do?

413
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:47,723
Princess!

414
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:52,190
It's frustrating to be a mute.
All I can do is watch.

415
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:52,990
The two of them?

416
00:53:53,623 --> 00:53:56,890
Out of greed, they took the horses.

417
00:53:57,657 --> 00:54:00,257
Then the enemy spotted them.
Fine allies.

418
00:54:14,926 --> 00:54:15,759
You!

419
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:22,893
We can't cross that river.

420
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,327
There is a firing squad
on the other side.

421
00:54:30,027 --> 00:54:32,961
I know your game.
Take the gold and get lost.

422
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:11,931
He's gone.

423
00:55:16,365 --> 00:55:18,765
Boss!

424
00:55:21,032 --> 00:55:22,999
There he is.

425
00:55:24,566 --> 00:55:27,366
Boss, the other side is lined
with Yamana soldiers.

426
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,133
What would you do?

427
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,066
What do I care?

428
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,233
What are you doing?

429
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,134
Wait and see at the fortress?

430
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,134
Shut up. Go away.

431
00:55:39,234 --> 00:55:40,767
Please, take us with you.

432
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,534
We promise to behave.

433
00:55:53,535 --> 00:55:54,202
What's that?

434
00:56:05,437 --> 00:56:07,103
The Yamana's found it!

435
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:11,771
What will we do?

436
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:30,739
We're leaving.

437
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:32,273
Which way?

438
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:33,706
Straight ahead.

439
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:34,840
You're joking!

440
00:56:37,673 --> 00:56:39,007
Leave it to me. I have a plan.

441
00:57:07,176 --> 00:57:08,076
Your pass?

442
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,410
Wait!

443
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:14,744
Boss.

444
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:19,611
Next!

445
00:57:23,311 --> 00:57:24,778
Your pass. What's your problem?

446
00:57:26,178 --> 00:57:27,011
I picked up something.

447
00:57:27,345 --> 00:57:29,145
What? It's just a piece of wood.

448
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:31,812
I found it at Mt. Suribachi.

449
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,213
He found this.

450
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:46,980
The Akizuki crest!

451
00:57:48,347 --> 00:57:49,814
You really found it
at Mt. Suribachi?

452
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,414
Bring me my horse!

453
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:55,414
That gold is mine. Give it back.

454
00:57:55,814 --> 00:57:56,514
No.

455
00:57:57,414 --> 00:57:59,148
Give me the gold or a reward.

456
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:01,682
Shut up. Get lost.

457
00:58:03,115 --> 00:58:04,548
Give me a reward. I won't move!

458
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:17,083
A reward! Give me a reward!

459
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:43,319
Greedy.

460
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,654
Two or three loaded horses,
several men and a girl.

461
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:06,788
If you see such a group,
arrest them immediately.

462
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:10,155
There are signs that Princess
Yuki's party has been here.

463
00:59:10,788 --> 00:59:13,389
But she was beheaded...

464
00:59:13,755 --> 00:59:15,822
Using a double has been
done before.

465
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:18,723
You also saw the smoke rise
on the mountain across.

466
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,189
That was Akizuki's hidden fortress.

467
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:25,123
It was guarded by an old soldier
and two others.

468
00:59:25,323 --> 00:59:26,490
They could have escaped. Instead
they burned the fortress

469
00:59:26,657 --> 00:59:28,524
and fought 'til their end.

470
00:59:28,657 --> 00:59:32,657
It appears they wanted to signal
and gain time for others to escape.

471
00:59:33,857 --> 00:59:37,558
The Princess and a few men
escaped with the gold for sure.

472
00:59:37,891 --> 00:59:39,925
There are traces on the road.

473
00:59:40,525 --> 00:59:44,092
Don't slack. Catch them
and you will be rewarded.

474
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:18,762
Are you ok, boss?

475
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:21,496
Let's take a back road.

476
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:24,896
- Stop sneaking around. It invites suspicion.
- But...

477
01:01:07,867 --> 01:01:08,534
What are you doing?

478
01:01:09,267 --> 01:01:10,267
We're staying here tonight.

479
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:12,301
Here?

480
01:01:14,434 --> 01:01:16,834
You've got to be kidding me.
Let's hurry through the night.

481
01:01:20,268 --> 01:01:21,868
It's a long way. Let's not push it.

482
01:01:22,135 --> 01:01:23,802
Then let's camp out.

483
01:01:24,702 --> 01:01:27,902
Hide a stone among stones
and a man among men.

484
01:01:39,137 --> 01:01:41,237
Where will we hide the gold?

485
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:43,304
Leave it out in the open.

486
01:02:12,773 --> 01:02:16,607
You're so slow. Get a clue
and bring some water.

487
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,775
Always crying,
but you refuse to take johns.

488
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:31,308
You were a lousy deal.

489
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:32,675
Where did you get her?

490
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:36,509
In Akizuki. Lose a war
and plenty of women go on sale.

491
01:02:36,742 --> 01:02:37,476
How much?

492
01:02:37,742 --> 01:02:39,443
Five silver pieces. Want her?

493
01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:41,976
Idiot. I'm not a dog like you.

494
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,210
- You bluff.
- No, sorry.

495
01:02:45,777 --> 01:02:46,677
Now, look here.

496
01:02:52,244 --> 01:02:52,811
Look.

497
01:02:53,177 --> 01:02:58,711
Average looking, but excellent
body. How about it?

498
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:01,845
For one silver piece,
she's yours for the night.

499
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:06,079
What's the use of buying a woman
who won't take customers?

500
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:12,579
How much is she?

501
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:16,813
She's a looker!

502
01:03:17,146 --> 01:03:18,647
She's not one of yours?

503
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:26,447
I'll buy her.
Who does she belong to?

504
01:03:28,214 --> 01:03:29,314
Whose girl is she?

505
01:03:29,781 --> 01:03:33,381
I'll buy her! I'll buy her
for a piece of gold!

506
01:03:35,615 --> 01:03:36,482
Enough!

507
01:03:37,615 --> 01:03:39,515
- She's a mute.
- Mute?

508
01:03:47,316 --> 01:03:49,450
That's too bad. I'll pass.

509
01:04:06,818 --> 01:04:08,118
Who's the owner
of the horse outside?

510
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:14,752
Is it yours?

511
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:17,152
Do you want to sell her to me?

512
01:04:17,852 --> 01:04:19,919
I'll give you whatever you want.

513
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:21,186
But my load...

514
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:27,853
She's too good for a packhorse. 5
silver pieces. You can buy 5 horses.

515
01:04:35,988 --> 01:04:37,721
Boss. What shall we do?

516
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:42,488
Two horses are not enough
for everything.

517
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:47,322
It's hard to find another one.

518
01:05:00,423 --> 01:05:01,323
This sucks.

519
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:02,524
There is no time for girls.

520
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:09,958
Buy that girl back.

521
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:11,191
I cannot.

522
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,391
Why not? I am
the Princess of Akizuki.

523
01:05:15,092 --> 01:05:16,792
I can't bear to see one
of our own in trouble.

524
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:19,292
No, you're in trouble...

525
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:22,059
Your kindness will harm you.

526
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:27,926
Whatever. Buy her back.

527
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:32,693
- No.
- You cannot make my heart mute too!

528
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:39,294
A cart was a bad idea.

529
01:05:39,861 --> 01:05:41,494
We're the horses now.

530
01:05:42,261 --> 01:05:44,261
And we've even taken in that girl.

531
01:05:57,296 --> 01:05:59,296
Stop following us. Go away.

532
01:06:00,696 --> 01:06:02,030
Go back to Akizuki.

533
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:12,264
Don't stop. Continue.

534
01:06:23,098 --> 01:06:27,032
Have you seen four people,
three horses and a girl?

535
01:06:27,499 --> 01:06:29,532
If you do, report them immediately.

536
01:06:37,366 --> 01:06:40,633
It went well. We're lucky.

537
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:50,401
Who said a cart was a bad idea?

538
01:06:51,034 --> 01:06:53,601
You were grumbling about the girl.

539
01:06:55,768 --> 01:06:59,802
But those men are stupid.
Why not check the wood?

540
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:08,736
What shall we do now?

541
01:07:13,903 --> 01:07:14,537
Be calm!

542
01:07:27,505 --> 01:07:28,172
Put it down.

543
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:36,006
Report them!

544
01:07:40,373 --> 01:07:41,640
Run! Wait on the hill!

545
01:08:41,212 --> 01:08:43,746
Why, if it isn't Rokurota Makabe!

546
01:08:47,413 --> 01:08:48,546
Hey, Hyoe Tadokoro!

547
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,613
Stand aside!
You're no match for him!

548
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:56,947
A rare meeting.

549
01:08:58,047 --> 01:09:01,314
I regret not meeting you on the
battlefields this time around.

550
01:09:02,381 --> 01:09:03,548
I regret it, too.

551
01:09:09,782 --> 01:09:10,548
How about a duel?

552
01:09:11,048 --> 01:09:11,749
With pleasure!

553
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:16,882
With what? A spear?

554
01:09:18,683 --> 01:09:19,483
Sounds good.

555
01:09:20,249 --> 01:09:21,816
All of them are inferior,
but choose one.

556
01:14:59,983 --> 01:15:00,650
I lost!

557
01:15:07,784 --> 01:15:08,718
Wait!

558
01:15:19,452 --> 01:15:20,452
We'll meet again.

559
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:24,953
Rokurota!

560
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:01,890
- Firewood?
- What about firewood?

561
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,790
Apparently gold is hidden
in the wood.

562
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:06,257
They're hiding here with all that.

563
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:09,157
Four of them.
One girl with three men.

564
01:16:09,724 --> 01:16:11,457
She's Princess Yuki from Akizuki.

565
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:14,791
The reward is 200 pieces
of gold for her.

566
01:16:15,091 --> 01:16:16,824
Five pieces just for information.

567
01:16:18,591 --> 01:16:21,091
Don't jump the gun.
It won't be easy.

568
01:16:21,558 --> 01:16:24,825
A strong general, Rokurota Makabe,
is with her.

569
01:16:46,661 --> 01:16:47,494
It's cold!

570
01:16:49,528 --> 01:16:50,894
It's been three days now.

571
01:16:52,395 --> 01:16:55,228
- More rain. More rain.
- What?

572
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:59,229
We can't move even if it stops.

573
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:03,229
We go out there
and we'll get beheaded.

574
01:17:03,962 --> 01:17:06,429
You madman.
Are you glad to be beheaded?

575
01:17:07,763 --> 01:17:08,530
Why not?

576
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,663
It's better than putting up
with this.

577
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:15,230
Then give up the gold and get lost.

578
01:17:17,697 --> 01:17:18,564
Good idea.

579
01:17:19,297 --> 01:17:20,131
I'll leave.

580
01:17:20,664 --> 01:17:22,131
But I'm taking all I can carry.

581
01:17:22,831 --> 01:17:24,164
I'll be set for life.

582
01:17:34,165 --> 01:17:35,266
I'll leave too.

583
01:17:39,033 --> 01:17:41,766
Great. What's left is all mine.

584
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:44,200
Take what you want and beat it.

585
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:53,667
But we're not getting anywhere.

586
01:18:02,602 --> 01:18:03,268
Where are you going?

587
01:18:04,302 --> 01:18:06,835
I'm going to find something
to put the gold in.

588
01:19:09,142 --> 01:19:11,642
The one with the shorter one
disappears for a while.

589
01:20:03,114 --> 01:20:03,980
He's late.

590
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:08,448
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

591
01:20:48,352 --> 01:20:50,318
What's going on?
Everyone is carrying wood...

592
01:20:51,285 --> 01:20:52,585
I know! It's the Fire Festival.

593
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:57,186
Haven't you heard of the Yamana
Fire Festival where the villagers

594
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:58,453
dance around a bonfire?

595
01:20:58,886 --> 01:20:59,953
We lucked out!

596
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,620
They're going in our direction.
If we join the crowd...

597
01:21:13,521 --> 01:21:16,821
I don't get it. Why do we have
to patrol a Fire Festival?

598
01:21:17,588 --> 01:21:19,655
Look. There's a lot
of wood at the Festival.

599
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:23,955
The Akizuki clan may hide here
with their gold hidden in firewood.

600
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:26,722
What's this?

601
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:18,894
There is too much wood to check.

602
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:22,594
We'll inspect the suspicious ones
who stray from the crowd.

603
01:22:46,697 --> 01:22:47,163
Where is everyone?

604
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:48,497
To the Festival...

605
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,464
Marching with the crowd...

606
01:22:57,031 --> 01:23:03,732
The life of a man

607
01:23:04,465 --> 01:23:09,366
Burn it with the fire

608
01:23:10,366 --> 01:23:17,200
The life of an insect

609
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:23,134
Throw it into the fire

610
01:23:25,134 --> 01:23:32,068
Ponder and you'll see

611
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:37,568
The world is dark

612
01:23:38,869 --> 01:23:47,169
And this floating world is a dream

613
01:23:47,836 --> 01:23:54,203
Burn with abandon

614
01:24:11,805 --> 01:24:15,339
Burn it! Throw the cart
into the fire!

615
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:16,639
No!

616
01:24:18,973 --> 01:24:23,006
- Don't be stingy, fool.
- No!

617
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:25,573
They're suspicious.

618
01:24:26,773 --> 01:24:28,540
Move. Burn it!

619
01:24:42,642 --> 01:24:43,475
Dance!

620
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:54,882
That's enough. Let's pack it up.

621
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:56,382
But, Boss, there's more...

622
01:25:57,016 --> 01:25:57,882
Don't be greedy!

623
01:25:59,183 --> 01:26:00,649
There's no point in taking more
than we can carry.

624
01:26:01,616 --> 01:26:04,617
You two carry 30 kan each.

625
01:26:05,683 --> 01:26:07,617
I carry 40... with the two women,
that's 20...

626
01:26:08,017 --> 01:26:09,584
What? I can carry 40 kan too.

627
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:10,917
I'll carry 50 kan.

628
01:26:44,654 --> 01:26:45,387
Hurry up!

629
01:27:23,524 --> 01:27:26,058
It's such a shame to leave
that gold.

630
01:27:29,725 --> 01:27:30,458
Go back?

631
01:27:37,059 --> 01:27:38,593
Where are you going?

632
01:28:04,128 --> 01:28:05,295
No more.

633
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,929
What are you looking for?

634
01:29:01,634 --> 01:29:03,468
Boss, help us!

635
01:29:04,735 --> 01:29:06,668
Help!

636
01:29:30,804 --> 01:29:31,904
If you want to live,
pick up your load.

637
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,740
Follow me!

638
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,414
Hurry up! We can cross
the mountain overnight.

639
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:51,385
It's hard. I'd rather be dead.

640
01:31:53,751 --> 01:31:54,718
Then die.

641
01:32:12,387 --> 01:32:13,187
Boss!

642
01:32:13,887 --> 01:32:14,554
Calm down!

643
01:32:32,022 --> 01:32:32,689
Don't stand up!

644
01:32:35,122 --> 01:32:38,056
Listen! I'll run and distract them.
Escape while you can.

645
01:33:02,825 --> 01:33:03,958
We're done for. Let's run.

646
01:33:05,825 --> 01:33:06,459
Farewell!

647
01:33:07,892 --> 01:33:08,659
Did you say something?

648
01:33:23,394 --> 01:33:27,727
I'm not worth it. Leave me and go.

649
01:33:49,396 --> 01:33:51,763
It's the end.

650
01:33:54,297 --> 01:33:56,464
If we get caught, they'll kill us.

651
01:33:59,197 --> 01:34:01,131
Not if we don't have any gold.

652
01:34:01,764 --> 01:34:02,831
We'll turn them in.

653
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:06,831
You're right.
Maybe we'll even get a reward.

654
01:34:06,965 --> 01:34:10,498
Idiot! They'll shoot us
if we're not careful.

655
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:17,332
I'm sure Yamana and Hayakawa
are patrolling their border.

656
01:34:18,299 --> 01:34:19,433
We can report them there.

657
01:35:05,104 --> 01:35:06,537
Your Highness... Hayakawa.

658
01:35:20,272 --> 01:35:23,172
Are you joking? We got them
and their gold long ago.

659
01:35:23,506 --> 01:35:24,706
Go home, fools.

660
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:58,076
Look carefully! You won't see
200 gold pieces again!

661
01:36:01,543 --> 01:36:03,743
I'd rather see Princess Yuki!

662
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:05,343
She's a sight for sore eyes.

663
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:09,044
To think she'll be beheaded
tomorrow...

664
01:36:11,511 --> 01:36:12,144
Stay away!

665
01:36:12,277 --> 01:36:13,211
Just a glance.

666
01:36:16,444 --> 01:36:17,911
Let me through!

667
01:36:20,178 --> 01:36:22,778
Tadokoro here to identify them.

668
01:36:38,713 --> 01:36:40,613
Hyoe Tadokoro!

669
01:36:52,981 --> 01:36:53,781
What happened to you?

670
01:37:04,049 --> 01:37:04,849
Where did you get that scar?

671
01:37:15,017 --> 01:37:17,084
You. You've changed.

672
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:20,817
Naturally.

673
01:37:22,851 --> 01:37:26,118
Tell me what happened. We're on
opposite sides,

674
01:37:26,818 --> 01:37:28,152
but we're true friends.

675
01:37:28,985 --> 01:37:33,285
Friends? Then why did you let me
survive the shame of my defeat?

676
01:37:34,252 --> 01:37:36,419
To defeat an enemy and to let him
live appears to be a kind act,

677
01:37:36,552 --> 01:37:38,586
but it is cruel.

678
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:41,386
Look at me!

679
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,520
My Lord shamed me
before everyone.

680
01:37:44,186 --> 01:37:45,820
See the scar left by
the relentless beating?

681
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:48,420
I curse you!

682
01:37:48,887 --> 01:37:52,287
Fool! Are you the
great Hyoe Tadokoro?

683
01:37:54,921 --> 01:37:56,454
What you make of another's
kindness is up to you.

684
01:37:56,821 --> 01:38:00,655
You and your Lord.
Evidently you're both fools.

685
01:38:02,322 --> 01:38:05,822
To punish you so for losing
to an enemy...

686
01:38:07,022 --> 01:38:09,556
Even I do not dare such a thing.

687
01:38:09,789 --> 01:38:11,089
I'm the Princess. It's me.

688
01:38:11,223 --> 01:38:12,056
Stop.

689
01:38:13,289 --> 01:38:15,356
I appreciate your loyalty,
but this is it.

690
01:38:17,923 --> 01:38:19,123
I want to die with dignity.

691
01:38:20,323 --> 01:38:23,890
Your Highness, this Rokurota
cannot apologize enough.

692
01:38:24,724 --> 01:38:28,158
You endured so much
and it was all in vain.

693
01:38:29,024 --> 01:38:32,625
You're wrong, Rokurota.
I had a good time.

694
01:38:35,525 --> 01:38:37,992
The happiness of these days
I would have

695
01:38:38,092 --> 01:38:40,059
never known living in the castle.

696
01:38:41,926 --> 01:38:43,559
I saw people as they really are...

697
01:38:44,593 --> 01:38:51,026
I saw their beauty and their
ugliness with my own eyes.

698
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:55,994
Rokurota, I thank you.

699
01:38:57,727 --> 01:39:01,828
- I can now die without regret.
- Your Highness!

700
01:39:03,428 --> 01:39:04,294
Rokurota.

701
01:39:05,895 --> 01:39:08,595
That Fire Festival was fun.

702
01:39:11,128 --> 01:39:12,262
I like that song.

703
01:39:15,829 --> 01:39:26,230
The life of a man

704
01:39:27,797 --> 01:39:34,297
Burn it with the fire

705
01:39:35,864 --> 01:39:44,365
The life of an insect

706
01:39:45,532 --> 01:39:52,766
Throw it into the fire

707
01:39:54,399 --> 01:40:03,900
Ponder and you'll see

708
01:40:05,001 --> 01:40:11,768
The world is dark

709
01:40:13,368 --> 01:40:22,136
And this floating world is a dream

710
01:41:16,974 --> 01:41:23,575
The life of a man

711
01:41:26,409 --> 01:41:32,576
Burn it with the fire

712
01:41:37,143 --> 01:41:37,943
Let's burn it!

713
01:41:40,643 --> 01:41:41,377
Turn the horses!

714
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:45,477
Turn them, I said!

715
01:41:56,078 --> 01:41:57,812
He's mad! Get them!

716
01:42:22,948 --> 01:42:25,715
Hurry, Rokurota! Take the Princess!

717
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:37,382
She is a great leader...
serve her well.

718
01:42:39,683 --> 01:42:40,349
Hyoe!

719
01:42:42,016 --> 01:42:44,550
Don't die in vain!
If you wish, follow us!

720
01:42:48,617 --> 01:42:49,150
Come!

721
01:43:15,953 --> 01:43:16,753
Forgive this traitor!

722
01:45:03,364 --> 01:45:07,031
Damn. When I got to Hayakawa
with the gold,

723
01:45:08,364 --> 01:45:10,598
I imagined I'd be so happy.

724
01:45:16,365 --> 01:45:18,065
We're lucky to have our heads.

725
01:45:19,999 --> 01:45:22,666
Let's stay friends.

726
01:45:24,999 --> 01:45:29,966
We risked death together, we'll stay
friends back at the village.

727
01:45:48,668 --> 01:45:49,535
Stray horses.

728
01:46:01,703 --> 01:46:03,170
Gold!

729
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:18,471
This is all mine.

730
01:46:18,771 --> 01:46:20,205
What? Give me one of them.

731
01:46:21,071 --> 01:46:22,205
I found them first.

732
01:46:22,805 --> 01:46:27,672
You are greedy. You said we
should split everything 50/50.

733
01:46:27,872 --> 01:46:29,139
That was then, this is now.

734
01:46:30,306 --> 01:46:32,073
You shithead.

735
01:47:18,911 --> 01:47:21,578
You. Are you from the Akizuki clan?

736
01:47:22,211 --> 01:47:25,678
No, we're just peasants.

737
01:47:26,578 --> 01:47:29,812
I don't get it.
Peasants with all this gold?

738
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:34,412
Arrest them!

739
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:49,647
Let's stay friends in heaven too.

740
01:48:09,849 --> 01:48:12,916
Matashichi! Tahei! Look up!

741
01:48:20,683 --> 01:48:22,384
What? It's me.

742
01:48:22,784 --> 01:48:25,884
No wonder.
Even I didn't recognize you.

743
01:48:26,784 --> 01:48:29,051
Your armor becomes you.

744
01:48:31,585 --> 01:48:32,618
Rokurota Makabe.

745
01:48:34,852 --> 01:48:36,418
You look even more handsome.

746
01:48:43,452 --> 01:48:47,553
You don't recognize
your Princess Yuki?

747
01:48:51,387 --> 01:48:53,653
The mute. The mute girl.

748
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:27,190
Matashichi. Tahei.

749
01:49:29,324 --> 01:49:31,824
You two went through a lot for us.

750
01:49:32,857 --> 01:49:37,358
However, that gold is an indispensable
fund to restore Akizuki.

751
01:49:38,191 --> 01:49:41,458
Not I, not even the Princess
can take it.

752
01:49:43,025 --> 01:49:45,992
I hope you will be satisfied
with this. Here.

753
01:49:50,626 --> 01:49:53,626
Split it fairly. No fighting.

754
01:50:17,328 --> 01:50:19,795
You keep this.

755
01:50:20,662 --> 01:50:21,962
No you keep it.

756
01:50:22,762 --> 01:50:23,696
But...

757
01:50:23,829 --> 01:50:24,763
Don't worry about it.

758
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:45,931
The End
