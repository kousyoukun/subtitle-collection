7
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,240
Stay away from me!

8
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,370
You stink of dead bodies.

9
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,880
Give it up.
We both smell of corpses.

10
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,940
And it's all your fault!

11
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,890
Your smell makes me want to puke.

12
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,100
Though shitworms can't smell shit.

13
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,560
What?

14
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,900
You're a shitworm.
You make me sick.

15
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,800
And you thought we'd make
a fortune at the war.

16
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,280
What's funny, you idiot!

17
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,010
lt's all funny!

18
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,120
First, we arrived late to the war.

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Then they mistook us for
the defeated side

20
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,270
and forced us to bury the dead.

21
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,570
We finally escaped and now it's
been 2 days we've only had water.

22
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,940
But the funniest thing is
your foolish cry baby face.

23
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,100
Let's go home.

24
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,910
Don't you have any pride?

25
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,550
We've even been stripped
of the arms we sold our homes for.

26
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,020
We can't go home like this.

27
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,890
Then take it off this dead guy.

28
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,000
Even if l'm desperate,
l'm not a thief.

29
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,730
Do what you want. l'm going!

30
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,500
Go. l'll come home after
l make a buck.

31
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,870
Don't come crying to me then.

32
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,350
Get caught again
and be a gravedigger.

33
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,210
Fool! Go away!

34
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,950
lt'll be a blessing to see you go,
you shitworm.

35
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,710
We can't cross the border
from this road.

36
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,420
lt's a Yamana check station.

37
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,120
Not even a mouse could pass
through those barricades.

38
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,550
lf they find us, we're dead.

39
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,800
What now?

40
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,770
Unless a fog breaks out,
we can't move.

41
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,420
What does it say up there?

42
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,590
lt's a notice about a reward
for 1 0 pieces of gold.

43
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,860
Read it to me.

44
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,140
''Wanted. Princess Yuki of Akizuki.''

45
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,580
''A reward of ten ryo
for her capture.''

46
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,910
''Three ryo for information
of her whereabouts.''

47
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,460
''By order of the Lord of Yamana.''

48
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,230
- Move!
- Walk!

49
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,800
l'm not one of them.

50
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,660
l'm thankful for the fog
but l can't see anything.

51
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,820
Which way is Hayakawa?

52
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,230
Shut up and follow me!

53
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,320
Who is it?

54
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,610
Not grave digging again.

55
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,900
Matashichi!

56
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,160
Listen!

57
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,630
There is 200 kan of pure gold
hidden in this castle.

58
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,280
Until you find it, you're no
longer men but moles!

59
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,890
So dig! Dig until you drop, moles!

60
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,390
Matashichi, this is hell.

61
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,160
lt's the end!

62
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,730
lf we're going to die,
let's die together.

63
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,410
That way!

64
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,630
Thieves! Rice thieves!

65
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,710
What shall we do now?

66
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,650
Find the Princess.

67
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,710
The Princess?

68
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,750
The sole survivor
of the Akizuki clan.

69
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,850
l think the reward on her head
is ten ryo.

70
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,250
Ten pieces of gold?

71
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,460
lnformers get three.

72
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,830
Three pieces of gold?

73
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,310
lt's no good. That's only a dream.

74
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,210
lf we get greedy and get caught,
we're done for.

75
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,150
l guess we'd better go home.

76
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,990
But how will we cross the border?

77
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,890
Bang and we're dead.

78
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,400
Let's eat.

79
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,500
l can't think on an empty stomach.

80
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,770
Not ready.

81
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,720
These don't burn at all.

82
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,400
What's this?

83
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,560
Why, it's gold!

84
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,870
You're right! lt's gold!

85
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,650
But...a piece of gold...
inside a stick?

86
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,660
l've heard of a rich man hiding
gold in the pillars of his home, but...

87
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,120
What's this? An insignia!

88
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,360
Looks like a crescent.

89
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,600
The crescent is the Akizuki crest!

90
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,400
That's the reserve gold they were
digging for in the castle.

91
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,660
You made the fire -
where did you get the wood?

92
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,690
Let's split up and look.

93
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,620
l'll go this way.
You go over there to the marsh.

94
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,160
The same piece!

95
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,960
What are you doing?

96
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,690
One's mine!

97
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,590
l found both!

98
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,320
l found the stick first.

99
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,590
l threw it!

100
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,360
l picked up the gold!

101
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,360
Liar! l'm the one who
noticed it was gold.

102
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,200
- Let's go back.
- Back?

103
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,610
There must be more.

104
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,140
lf someone else notices it,
we're screwed.

105
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,690
He's following us.

106
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,090
Watch out. Maybe he's a bandit.

107
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,790
He's not a bandit. He has no sword.

108
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,730
You can't be sure.
He may work for one.

109
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,180
He stopped following us.

110
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,390
Let's go back.

111
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,860
No, better be careful.

112
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,940
lt's late, anyway.
lt won't hurt to wait one night.

113
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,970
lt's a big job.
Better safe than sorry.

114
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,760
We haven't seen that guy since,
so maybe we didn't need to worry.

115
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:22,370
Probably a lumberjack
or a charcoal maker.

116
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,240
So, let's get this straight now.

117
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,380
What?

118
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,350
Don't play dumb.
How to split up the gold.

119
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,720
Let's be fair and divide it equally.

120
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,320
You don't like it?

121
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,840
- But l...
- Then it's settled! All right?

122
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,880
Let's sleep.

123
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,680
Sleep tight, and let's dream
of mountains of gold.

124
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,320
Hey!

125
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,130
Good eve...

126
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,110
Hey!

127
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,880
Cold, isn't it?

128
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,580
What are you doing here
in the mountain?

129
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,750
How about you?

130
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:01,430
- Us? We intend to cross the border.
- The border?

131
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,030
- We want to go to Hayakawa.
- Hayakawa?

132
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,270
But beyond the mountains
it's Yamana.

133
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,940
Yes...but you see...

134
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,890
to go to Hayakawa...

135
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,500
This is Hayakawa.

136
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,500
And this is Akizuki

137
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,530
where we are now.

138
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,680
This is...Yamana.

139
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:57,080
We want to go from Akizuki
to Hayakawa.

140
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,760
But the border is guarded
by Yamana soldiers.

141
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:12,370
So, we'll cross first to Yamana.

142
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,700
And then slip into Hayakawa.

143
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,640
See...

144
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,010
There's no way that survivors
of the Akizuki clan

145
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,090
would go to Yamana,
the enemy territory.

146
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:34,750
So the border between Akizuki
and Yamana should be open.

147
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,220
That's right.

148
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,300
The Hayakawa-Yamana border
must be

149
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,810
easier to cross than
the Akizuki-Hayakawa border.

150
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,950
Anyway, we're just peasants.

151
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,110
Even if anything happened,
we'd still make it.

152
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,900
All right. l've made up my mind.

153
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,170
Going through Yamana
is a good idea.

154
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,330
The 200 gold pieces are useless
here, but with three men

155
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,850
and three horses,
we can carry it out.

156
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,980
200 gold pieces?
What are you talking about?

157
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,950
Be honest.

158
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,570
l've got an eye on that place.

159
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,570
- Don't kick the stones.
- You stop grabbing my leg.

160
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,830
What now?

161
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,030
What is he doing?

162
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,010
He's not here.

163
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,950
Where did he go?

164
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,450
That guy can't be trusted.

165
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,950
What is this place?

166
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,470
lt's what they call
a hidden fortress.

167
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,710
A hidden fortress?
The Akizuki one.

168
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,420
Look. You can see all of Yamana.

169
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,090
But...

170
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,580
For a fortress,
it's strangely empty.

171
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,300
Someone's here!

172
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,040
What are you doing?

173
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,640
Oh, it's that guy.

174
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,790
Hey. Come down quickly.

175
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,300
How did you get down there?

176
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,840
What are your names?

177
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,120
l'm Matashichi.

178
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,850
l'm Tahei.

179
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,410
Matashichi, put the rice down.

180
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,580
Tahei, you put the rice in the pot.

181
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,590
Hurry up!

182
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:50,830
Where's the water? l need
a drink before the food.

183
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,070
Me too. l can't even spit anymore.

184
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,200
Hey. What's your name?

185
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,150
Me? l'm Rokurota Makabe.

186
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,010
Rokurota Makabe?
l've heard that name before.

187
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,650
Makabe...

188
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,860
Rokurota Makabe...

189
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,300
Get out of here. Rokurota Makabe

190
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,970
is a legendary Akizuki
samurai general.

191
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,340
You take us for fools.

192
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,470
We shouldn't put up with this.

193
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:11,010
Hey. Stop fooling around. You're no
general, you're just a bully.

194
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,290
What's with the big attitude?

195
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:23,130
Don't make fun of us. Damn you.

196
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,120
What?

197
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,060
That wasn't very nice.

198
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,560
You could have told us if
there was a secret passageway.

199
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,800
We've been partners
since last night.

200
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,710
Besides, just because you found
this place first,

201
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,710
doesn't mean you're the boss.

202
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,990
Let's decide now how
we're going to divvy up.

203
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,420
Fair and square, we share it
in three equal parts. Deal?

204
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,230
Here's the water.

205
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,460
Excellent.

206
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,820
This is some fortress that
they have water like this.

207
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,270
Don't bother.
l already went through there.

208
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,480
Just prepare the rice.

209
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,480
Shut up. l can't take it anymore.
You can stuff your orders.

210
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,140
You want to fight?

211
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,150
Don't hold back. Do him in.

212
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,320
Cook the rice.

213
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,930
lt's a girl.

214
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,710
Where is she? Who is she?

215
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,550
l don't know. She's really quick
though. She's already gone.

216
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,930
Look. She's mine, OK? l'll kill you
if you go near her.

217
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,340
Cook and then it's work.

218
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,570
What are you doing?

219
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,060
Don't touch me, fool!
lt's uncomfortable enough.

220
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,700
lt's your face that
makes me uncomfortable.

221
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,250
Leave my face alone.

222
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,720
l hate the way you blink
all the time.

223
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,150
There you go again.

224
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,800
Shut up. Put your filthy teeth away.

225
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:11,070
Show them to me once more
and l'll bash them in.

226
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:31,120
l'm quitting! This is idiotic!
l dig and dig and nothing!

227
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,390
lt's his fault.

228
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,640
Dammit. Gone again.

229
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:56,110
He's on his highhorse
watching us do all the work.

230
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,830
Right. He's probably running
around looking for that girl.

231
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,660
Maybe he already found a place
and is sleeping with her.

232
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,800
We agreed to split everything in
three. The girl should be the same.

233
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,040
That bully is not just anyone.

234
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,800
l can't figure out what he's up to.

235
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,080
He may already have found the 200
pieces of gold and moved them.

236
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,390
That's very likely. l'm sure of it.

237
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,720
That means he's hiding the gold
right now.

238
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,360
So if he's not in this fortress...

239
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,960
Look!

240
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,300
That spring is fishy.

241
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,250
Pretending like he's already
checked it out...damn.

242
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,970
Where do you live?

243
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,040
Hey, lady, don't be mad.

244
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,970
What are you doing?

245
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:45,180
Shut up! l told you l'd kill you
if you touched her!

246
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,990
Wait, boss. lt's not fair.

247
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,480
Look. The girl dropped this.

248
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,100
Don't go behind our back.
She's worth 1 0 ryo.

249
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,260
This does not belong
to a country girl.

250
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,840
Maybe you think she's the
Akizuki princess.

251
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,310
You're right.

252
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,310
That comb does belong
to Princess Yuki.

253
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,020
But now it belongs to me.
Give it back.

254
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,650
l took it from the Princess
and gave it to her.

255
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,930
What?

256
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,060
l don't lie.

257
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,160
Then where is Princess Yuki?

258
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,960
l captured her and handed her
over to the Yamana authorities.

259
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,500
Careful. l think he's full of crap.

260
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:50,370
Here's the reward of 1 0 ryo.
Still think it's a lie?

261
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,130
Tell me. Where did Matashichi go?

262
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,830
l don't know.

263
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,430
What are you plotting? Tell me!

264
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,070
To...to the town.

265
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,710
To do what?

266
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,410
He went to report.

267
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,120
Report who?

268
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,010
- The princess, of course.
- The princess?

269
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,000
We're not as stupid as you think.

270
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:45,290
You thought you had fooled us
but we're not that gullible.

271
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,710
l know your game.

272
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:57,780
Your reward money is just
a part of the hidden gold.

273
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,380
You're greedy on top of it.

274
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,090
You want to capture
the princess yourself

275
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,560
so you can have all the reward.

276
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,030
lt won't go so smoothly.

277
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,700
l made a mistake
by relying on scum.

278
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,260
You think you're better, scum?

279
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:28,270
Matashichi, did you see
the officers?

280
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,850
Fool. Do you think
l'd be back so soon?

281
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,010
lt's the talk of town already.
The princess was captured

282
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,890
a while back and
she was beheaded yesterday.

283
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,580
Boss, we're sorry we doubted you.

284
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,670
lt's Rokurota Makabe.

285
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,270
Enter.

286
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:53,850
Any news?

287
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,160
Kofuyu served her duty.

288
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,970
The enemy will relax
their guard now.

289
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,770
Now is our chance to escape.

290
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,370
What happened to Kofuyu?

291
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,020
As a dutiful servant, my sister went
in place of your Highness.

292
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:25,290
This assures the safety
of your Highness.

293
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,180
Rokurota!

294
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:28,950
Fool!

295
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,390
What are you saying your Highness?

296
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:38,900
Kofuyu was 1 6...l am 1 6. What
difference is there in our souls?

297
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:45,940
lt is our duty as servants.
Kofuyu was honored...

298
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:52,110
Lies! lf l were Kofuyu,
l would curse this Princess.

299
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:57,620
Your words are too harsh.
Rokurota has no leg to stand on.

300
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,020
Be quiet!

301
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,330
l don't even want to see your face!

302
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,630
Your nobility that doesn't
even shed a tear

303
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,200
when you've killed your sister.

304
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,710
l hate it!

305
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,880
l hate it!

306
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:36,130
l don't know what to do with her
Highness. lt's the Lord's fault.

307
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,660
Even if he was lacking an heir,

308
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,900
it was cruel to raise her Highness
like a boy.

309
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,160
Say right and she'll go left,
say left and she'll go right.

310
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:56,010
And though she is a girl,
she has never shown me a tear.

311
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,610
The same
with her present behavior.

312
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:04,580
lnsensitive to your pain of having
sacrificed your sister, she...

313
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,320
She herself does not shed a tear,
but she still criticizes you.

314
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,760
lt's too much.

315
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,560
Her Highness is the real sacrifice.

316
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,800
Her suffering of having to rebuild
the Akizuki clan...

317
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,620
The Yamana's are here!

318
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,990
There are horses at the spring.

319
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:17,420
This is good, to fool the Yamana's
by going through enemy lines.

320
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,450
This was the peasants' idea.

321
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,660
Depending on their answers,
l was ready to kill them.

322
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,930
But hearing their plan to go
through Yamana to Hayakawa,

323
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,230
l was stunned.

324
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,810
Sometimes even moss can be smart...

325
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,440
How long can we rely on them?

326
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,180
We can rely on their greed.

327
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,580
Make them carry gold and
they'll put up with anything.

328
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,420
That takes care of the gold.

329
00:53:55,430 --> 00:54:00,920
But we cannot take a chance
with the Princess.

330
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:05,370
But staying here is not safe either.

331
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,870
This hidden fortress will soon
be discovered by the Yamana's too.

332
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,410
And our deal with Lord Hayakawa
may not last either.

333
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,940
Understood.

334
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:23,380
But what shall we do
with the Princess?

335
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,890
We can disguise her looks,
but not her class.

336
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,770
And her speech...

337
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,040
Her Highness
will have to be a mute.

338
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,870
A mute...isn't there any other way?

339
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,270
There isn't.

340
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,120
l don't know if the Princess
would agree.

341
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,890
Leave it to me.

342
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,330
l hadn't ridden in a long time.

343
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,000
She runs fast. She's too good
to be a packhorse.

344
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,640
Just in case you need to ride.

345
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,940
So we finally pass
through enemy lines.

346
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:27,620
- Speaking of which, could you play mute?
- Mute?

347
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,250
l'm sure you couldn't do it.

348
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:40,530
To go through Yamana, my greatest
concern is your speech.

349
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:45,030
We were discussing
you could be a mute...

350
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,700
But l think it's impossible.

351
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,710
l was captured once and
had to pretend to be a mute.

352
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,210
lt was agony.

353
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,580
Your Highness couldn't take it.

354
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,090
l'm not biting.

355
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,160
When you say right, l say left.

356
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,370
l'm a handful.

357
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:30,370
Let me use reverse psychology.

358
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,580
Princess.

359
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,050
All right.

360
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:45,300
This once l will let you fool me.
Otherwise your plan will be foiled.

361
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,940
Your noble face again.

362
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,980
lf you need anything, tell me now.

363
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,440
Once l'm a mute,
l'm not talking until Hayakawa.

364
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:21,890
We have to tell him.

365
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,160
The bully? Never mind him.

366
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,740
ldiot, shut up. We'll get caught.

367
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,130
Where are you going?

368
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,410
Boss, run! The Yamana soldiers
have found us.

369
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:07,740
There were horses by the spring.

370
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,610
ldiots. l stole those.

371
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,990
We can't carry 200 pieces
of gold without them.

372
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,260
Gold?

373
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,890
We'll climb down today.

374
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,270
Where is the gold?

375
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,410
Hey. Where is the gold?

376
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:50,350
Don't hold out on us. Come on.

377
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:00,330
l knew it!

378
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,700
Don't fool around with us.

379
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,730
You said you had already gone
through there.

380
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,610
Why did you make us dig
at the fortress?

381
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:13,940
l was testing you.

382
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,350
We'll need a lot of backbone
on the road. You did well.

383
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,380
Lift the gold out of the water
and onto the horses.

384
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,820
The three of us will carry the rest.

385
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,330
Gold!

386
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,210
Leave the gold in the wood.

387
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,540
Dammit.

388
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,560
Where did you hide this?

389
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,560
You're so suspicious.
That's just firewood.

390
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:50,800
lt's a bad idea to take the girl.
She'll slow us down.

391
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,110
What if she blabs...

392
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,980
- She's mute. Don't worry.
- Mute?

393
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,060
This will be an easy border
to cross.

394
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,000
Wait.

395
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,440
Better be cautious.

396
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,890
Don't move 'til l come back.

397
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:55,930
lf we want to get rid of him,
now's our chance.

398
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:04,110
Don't worry. She's mute.

399
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,110
She's mute but she can hear.

400
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:11,450
Stupid. A mute can't speak
because she's deaf.

401
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,390
This is where we have to think.

402
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:22,750
He's sly so we can't trust him even
if we cross into Hayakawa.

403
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,990
He'll cheat us.

404
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:28,230
Let's run away.

405
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,000
What about his load?

406
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:37,870
We can't carry it.
We'll take his horse.

407
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,320
There's no time to argue.

408
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,180
Let's tell her we're taking
the horses for a drink.

409
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,090
Fool. They're not drinking sake.

410
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,520
What are you doing?

411
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,490
Where are the horses?

412
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:55,600
What shall we do?

413
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,200
Princess!

414
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,810
lt's frustrating to be a mute.
All l can do is watch.

415
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:38,810
The two of them?

416
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:43,680
Out of greed, they took the horses.

417
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,890
Then the enemy spotted them.
Fine allies.

418
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,270
You!

419
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:16,220
We can't cross that river.

420
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:19,250
There is a firing squad
on the other side.

421
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,790
l know your game.
Take the gold and get lost.

422
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,570
He's gone.

423
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,090
Boss!

424
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:31,420
There he is.
