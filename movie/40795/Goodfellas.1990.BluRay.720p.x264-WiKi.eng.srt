1
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,847
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:07,542
Jimmy?

3
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:09,877
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?

4
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,714
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:14,387
Maybe you got a flat.

6
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,888
What the fuck? Pull over.

7
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,250
He's still alive. You piece of shit!

8
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:51,926
Die, you motherfucker!

9
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,662
Look at me!

10
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,743
To me...

11
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:52,149
...being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

12
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:58,821
Even before I went to the cabstand
for an after-school job...

13
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,258
...I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

14
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:05,831
It was there that I knew I belonged.
To me, it meant being somebody...

15
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:08,333
...in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

16
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:11,972
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

17
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,506
They parked in front of hydrants
and never got a ticket.

18
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,837
When they played cards all night...

19
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,174
...nobody ever called the cops.

20
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:33,693
Tony Stacks. How are you?

21
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:37,031
Tuddy Cicero.

22
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,699
Could this be the Canarsie kid?

23
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,772
Tuddy.

24
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:48,309
Tuddy ran the cabstand and
the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

25
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:53,313
...and other places for his brother Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

26
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:59,819
Paulie might have moved slow...

27
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:06,351
...but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.

28
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,465
It's your fault.

29
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,635
Yeah, it's your fault.

30
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:19,466
At first my parents loved that I found
a job across the street from the house.

31
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:24,242
My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

32
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:30,344
He always used to say that
American kids were spoiled lazy.

33
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,852
Henry! Watch how you cross!

34
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:40,552
Bring back milk!

35
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,661
My mother was happy after
she found out the Ciceros...

36
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:47,664
...came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...

37
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,371
...that was the answer to her prayers.

38
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,909
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

39
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,509
I could go anywhere, do anything.

40
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,249
I knew everybody,
and everybody knew me.

41
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:05,076
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy
would let me park their Cadillacs.

42
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,846
Here I am, this little kid, I can't
even see over the steering wheel...

43
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,151
...and I'm parking Cadillacs.

44
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,665
But, it wasn't too long...

45
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:21,166
...before my parents changed their
minds about my job at the cabstand.

46
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:26,099
For them, it was supposed to be a
part-time job. But for me...

47
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,001
...it was definitely full time.

48
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:30,176
That's all I wanted to do.

49
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,439
People like my father could never
understand, but I was part of something.

50
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,550
I belonged. I was
treated like a grown-up.

51
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,117
Tell him 519.

52
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,184
Every day I was learning to score.

53
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:46,952
A dollar here, a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.

54
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,725
Have a good day at school?

55
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,128
My father was always pissed off.

56
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:56,669
Pissed that he made such lousy
money, that my brother...

57
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,396
...was in a wheelchair.

58
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:02,567
He was pissed that seven of us
lived in such a tiny house.

59
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,504
Tell me about this.

60
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,208
A letter from school.

61
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,843
It says you haven't
been there in months.

62
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:13,151
Months!

63
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,190
You're a bum!

64
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,751
Want to grow up to be a bum?!

65
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:24,361
After a while, he was mostly pissed
because I hung around the cabstand.

66
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,534
He knew what went on there.

67
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:31,468
Every once in a while I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

68
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,368
The way I saw it...

69
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,370
...everybody takes a beating sometime.

70
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,072
I can't make any more deliveries.

71
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:41,216
You'll fuck everything up.

72
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,519
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

73
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:45,012
Come with me.

74
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:46,881
Is that him there?

75
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,254
How about him?

76
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,492
- That's him.
- Get him.

77
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:56,729
Excuse me.

78
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,496
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.

79
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:09,804
Know this kid?

80
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,204
Know where he lives?

81
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,107
You deliver mail to his house?

82
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,049
Understand?

83
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:23,283
Another letter from school
goes to that kid's house...

84
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:25,561
...in the oven you'll go, head first.

85
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:30,061
That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.

86
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,130
In fact, no more letters from anybody.

87
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:36,098
After a few weeks, my mother went
to the post office to complain.

88
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,302
How could I go to school after that...

89
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:42,237
...and pledge allegiance and sit
through good government bullshit?

90
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,143
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.

91
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:51,013
Mickey called.

92
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:53,287
Call him back.

93
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:58,253
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back.

94
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,995
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

95
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:06,632
There were guys, that's all they did all
day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

96
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:18,579
For a guy who moved all day long...

97
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:21,647
...Paulie didn't talk to 6 people.
With union problems...

98
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,818
...or a beef in the numbers...

99
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:27,284
...only the top guys spoke
with Paulie about the problem.

100
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,117
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,954
He didn't want anyone
hearing what he said...

102
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,190
...or anyone listening to
what he was being told.

103
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,732
Hundreds of guys depended on him, and
he got a piece of everything they made.

104
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:46,499
It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

105
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:50,974
All they got from Paulie was protection
from the guys trying to rip them off.

106
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:55,310
That's what it's all about. That's
what the FBI could never understand.

107
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,984
What Paulie and the organization does...

108
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:02,089
...is protect people who can't
go to the cops. That's it.

109
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:06,225
They're like the police
department for wiseguys.

110
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:20,637
People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.

111
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:24,437
I didn't have to wait in line at the
bakery on Sunday morning for fresh bread.

112
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:29,808
The owner knew who I was with and no
matter how many people were waiting...

113
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,648
...I was taken care of first.

114
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:36,414
Our neighbors stopped parking in our
driveway, even though we had no car.

115
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:37,693
At 13...

116
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:42,353
...I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.

117
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,098
I had it all.

118
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,903
One day...

119
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:58,739
One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

120
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,448
Know why?

121
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,209
It was out of respect.

122
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,219
What do you think?

123
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:10,325
Aren't my shoes great?

124
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,194
You look like a gangster.

125
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,396
They shot me. Help!

126
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,998
Henry, shut the door.

127
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:23,700
That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

128
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,001
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

129
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,871
I can't have that in this joint.

130
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,878
I remember feeling bad
about the guy, but also...

131
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,242
...feeling maybe Tuddy was right.

132
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,917
I knew Paulie didn't want
anyone dying in the building.

133
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:40,886
You're a real jerk. You wasted
8 fucking aprons on this guy.

134
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,353
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

135
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:06,514
It was a glorious time.

136
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,817
And wiseguys were all over the place.

137
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,286
It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...

138
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:16,389
...decided to take on
a boss and start a war.

139
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,056
It was when I met the world.

140
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:22,225
And it was when
I first met Jimmy Conway.

141
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:28,301
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time, but he was already a legend.

142
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:32,907
He'd just walk in and everybody
who worked the room went wild.

143
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:35,838
He'd give a doorman $100
for opening the door.

144
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:39,778
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and guys who ran the games.

145
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:42,917
The bartender got $100
for keeping ice cubes cold.

146
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:45,781
The Irishman is here to
take you Guineas' money.

147
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,585
- Want a drink?
- Give me a 7 and 7.

148
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:01,099
Meet the kid Henry.

149
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:07,506
Keep them coming.

150
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:10,846
Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

151
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:15,607
He was first locked up at 11, and
doing hits for mob bosses at 16.

152
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:19,112
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

153
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:23,519
But what Jimmy really loved to do,
what he really loved to do was steal.

154
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,021
He actually enjoyed it.

155
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,297
Give me your wallet.

156
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:38,837
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.

157
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,908
He was one of the biggest highjackers...

158
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:44,977
...of booze, cigarettes, razor
blades, shrimp and lobsters.

159
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:46,704
Shrimp and lobsters were best.

160
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,213
They went fast.

161
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:52,147
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

162
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:53,878
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

163
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:55,123
Help the lady.

164
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,859
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

165
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,494
...about the really good loads,
of course, everybody got a piece.

166
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,863
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

167
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,864
Henry, come here.

168
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,165
Meet Tommy.

169
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:15,405
Youse gonna be working together, okay?
Good.

170
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,772
Jimmy, you get anything good?

171
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:23,177
And when the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

172
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,181
He made them partners.

173
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:28,083
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

174
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,086
- What do you need?
- Two Luckys.

175
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,431
What are you doing?

176
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,536
- It's all right.
- Who says? Your mother?

177
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,035
How many you need?

178
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:45,763
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

179
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:48,372
- It's okay.
- It's not okay!

180
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,910
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

181
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:58,315
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?

182
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,384
By the factory.

183
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:04,515
Henry Hill. The People of the
State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

184
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:07,125
Docket #704162.

185
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,725
Yes, sir. That's me.

186
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:16,705
Just stand there. Now stay there.

187
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,470
Proceed.

188
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,550
Congratulations.

189
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,285
A graduation present.

190
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,852
- Why? I got pinched.
- Everyone does. You did it right.

191
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,854
- You told them nothing.
- I thought you'd be mad.

192
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:40,254
I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

193
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,427
You took your first pinch
like a man,

194
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,659
and learned the two
greatest things in life.

195
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:47,569
Look at me.

196
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,929
Never rat on your friends...

197
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:52,502
...and always keep your mouth shut.

198
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,111
Here he is!

199
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,581
You broke your cherry!

200
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,116
Congratulations!

201
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:46,486
By the time I grew up, there was
30 billion a year in cargo...

202
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:51,393
...moving through Idlewild Airport,
and we tried to steal every bit of it.

203
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,067
See, we grew up near the airport.

204
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:58,568
It belonged to Paulie. We had friends
and relatives who worked all over it.

205
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:02,743
They would tip us off about what
was coming in and moving out.

206
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:05,845
If any truckers or airlines
gave us trouble...

207
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:10,040
...Paulie's union people scared them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

208
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:14,254
It was a bigger moneymaker than
numbers and Jimmy was in charge.

209
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:17,253
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

210
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:19,860
To us, it was better than Citibank.

211
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,034
You got a phone?! Come on!

212
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:38,074
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?!

213
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,583
There was Jimmy and Tommy...

214
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,787
...and me.

215
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,420
And there was Anthony Stabile.

216
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,254
Frankie Carbone.

217
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,595
And then there was Mo
Black's brother, Fat Andy.

218
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,993
And his guys, Frankie the Wop...

219
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,238
...and Freddy No Nose.

220
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,565
And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.

221
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,280
Then you had Nickey Eyes...

222
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,251
...and Mikey Franzese.

223
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:21,144
Jimmy Two-Times, nicknamed
because he said everything twice.

224
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,891
I'll get the papers, get the papers.

225
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:40,141
What is this, coats?
I need suits, Henry, not coats.

226
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,873
Thursday.

227
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,113
This is the summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

228
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,041
So I'll take them away.

229
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,946
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat.

230
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:54,883
For us to live any other way was nuts.

231
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,184
To us those goody-good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...

232
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,454
...and took the subway to work and
worried about bills, were dead.

233
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:06,394
They were suckers.
They had no balls.

234
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,898
If we wanted something, we just took it.

235
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:13,574
If anyone complained twice, they got
hit so bad they never complained again.

236
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,300
It was all just routine.
You didn't even think about it.

237
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,316
Frankie, what the fuck does 520...

238
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,346
...have to do with 469?

239
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,520
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

240
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,654
Piece of cake. Don't worry about
the alarms. I just got to get a key.

241
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,991
- No problems?
- I'll take care of it.

242
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:49,876
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

243
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:55,873
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming on.

244
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,921
Americans change their money over
into French money, send it back here.

245
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,384
- Calm down.
- It's beautiful.

246
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,725
It's totally, totally untraceable.

247
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,725
Our only problem is getting
a key, but I got a plan.

248
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,356
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.

249
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:18,233
If I'm right, there could be
half a mil coming in, all cash.

250
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,039
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday.

251
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:26,748
There's a Jewish holiday Monday. They
won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.

252
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:28,746
What about the security?

253
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,145
Security?

254
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:34,952
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight to eight man.

255
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:38,157
Just come in like you're
picking up lost baggage.

256
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,827
- It's beautiful.
- There won't be a problem.

257
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:42,758
- Good.
- We're on.

258
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,262
What's really funny was that
fucking bank job in Secaucus.

259
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,504
I'm in the weeds lying down.

260
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:53,070
He said, "What are you doing?"
I said, "Resting. Here?"

261
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,243
"In the weeds? I'm resting!"

262
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:59,746
They pull me in, start asking questions.
You know, this and that.

263
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,615
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing."

264
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:08,346
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

265
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:11,082
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

266
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,899
You saw the paper.
My head was out like this.

267
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,633
I'm coming around and who
do I see in front of me?

268
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:25,465
This prick again. He says, " What
do you want to tell me now?"

269
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,940
I said, " What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother."

270
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:32,808
I thought he'd shit.

271
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:39,443
The fuckers. I wish
I was big just once.

272
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,951
Funny. You're really funny.

273
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,826
What do you mean?

274
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,497
It's funny, you know.
It's a good story.

275
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,496
You're a funny guy.

276
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,668
You mean the way I talk? What?

277
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,805
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

278
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,675
You know, the way you tell the story.

279
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:06,779
Funny how? What's funny about it?

280
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,640
You got it all wrong.

281
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:13,786
He's a big boy. He knows
what he said. Funny, how?

282
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,826
Just, you know. You're funny.

283
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:20,857
Let me understand this.

284
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,964
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

285
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,994
But I'm funny how? Funny
like a clown? I amuse you?

286
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,837
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

287
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:32,868
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

288
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,539
You know, how you tell a story.

289
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,517
I don't know. You said it.
You said I'm funny.

290
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:46,718
How am I funny? What the
fuck is so funny about me?

291
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:48,445
Tell me what's funny.

292
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:56,127
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

293
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:59,828
Motherfucker! I almost had him.

294
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:02,003
You stuttering prick, you.

295
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:03,994
Frankie, was he shaking?

296
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,533
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

297
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:18,578
What's with you? I thought I
was getting pinched already.

298
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:22,517
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?

299
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:25,854
This guy didn't want
to give you the check.

300
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:27,593
Could you take care of this?

301
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:30,525
No problem. Tell him
to put it on my tab.

302
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,597
I want to talk to you about that.

303
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,431
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

304
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:40,607
That ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...

305
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:44,710
It's good you don't like
to be out of order, Sonny.

306
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:48,246
Embarrassing me in front of my
friends, like I'm a deadbeat.

307
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,077
You're a mutt. You know the
money we spend in this fucking...

308
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,449
- Don't be like that.
- Like what?

309
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,023
Do you believe him?

310
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:05,632
You think this is funny?

311
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,933
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

312
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,467
You don't want to bring the check?

313
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:17,909
Do you believe this prick?

314
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:23,281
You're supposed to be
doing this stuff, too.

315
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,480
You're a funny guy.

316
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,921
That's it, Henry!

317
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:33,121
You want to laugh? This prick
asked me to christen his kid.

318
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,829
I charged him seven thousand.

319
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:42,793
You really are a funny guy.

320
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,975
I'm worried. I'm hearing bad things.

321
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:51,677
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.

322
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,283
I got to go on the lam to
get away from this guy.

323
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:58,313
This ain't right.
I can't go here or there.

324
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,956
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.

325
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:06,091
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.

326
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:08,694
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.

327
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,162
You know this Tommy all your life.

328
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,528
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

329
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,536
When I leave my house in the
morning I look over both shoulders.

330
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,937
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.

331
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:25,010
- Tell me what to do, I'll do it.
- What could I do?

332
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,883
If there was something I could do,
I would. I'd like to help you out.

333
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,717
Tell him what we talked about.

334
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:40,959
Maybe you could come in with me, take
a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

335
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:42,656
What do you mean?

336
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:44,128
The restaurant?

337
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,364
It's a classy place.

338
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,367
You've been in here a million times.

339
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,569
Tommy taking over this joint is
like putting a silk hat on a pig.

340
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,702
I don't mean disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

341
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:01,513
I'm begging you. What can I say?

342
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,151
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?

343
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:08,879
I don't know anything about
the restaurant business.

344
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:12,057
All I know is how to sit
down and order a meal.

345
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,386
Not for you. Just a place to hang.

346
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:19,326
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

347
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,228
What do you want from me?

348
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:25,066
Tommy's a bad seed. What am
I supposed to do? Shoot him?

349
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,308
That wouldn't' be a bad idea.

350
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:36,783
Sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.

351
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,987
I just need help. Help me, please.

352
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,619
Know anything about the
restaurant business?

353
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,225
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.

354
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:49,887
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

355
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:51,926
You want me to be your partner?

356
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,168
Is that what you're telling me?

357
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:57,633
What do you think I'm telling you?
Paulie, please.

358
00:25:57,906 --> 00:25:59,396
It's not even fair.

359
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,573
You don't understand.

360
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,746
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.

361
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:09,405
God bless you, Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.

362
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:13,778
Now he's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

363
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,023
Trouble with a bill, to Paulie.

364
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:18,590
Trouble with cops, deliveries, Tommy...

365
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,923
...he calls Paulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie...

366
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,825
...every week no matter what.

367
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:28,126
"Business bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me."

368
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:31,839
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me."

369
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,634
Also, Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on the joint's credit.

370
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,474
And why not? Nobody
will pay for it anyway.

371
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:45,617
Take deliveries at the front door and
sell it out the back at a discount.

372
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,687
Take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.

373
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:51,489
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

374
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:56,862
Then finally, when
there's nothing left...

375
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:00,657
...when you can't borrow
another buck from the bank...

376
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,501
...you bust the joint out.
You light a match.

377
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,798
Do you need help reaching anything?

378
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:09,170
You look like you're
decorating a Christmas tree.

379
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,509
She's from the Five Towns.

380
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:17,516
Who?

381
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:20,518
The Jew broad. Diane.

382
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:26,892
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.

383
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,190
- No.
- No what?

384
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:32,333
No what? Who asked you anything?

385
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,897
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.

386
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,196
Okay, what?

387
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:43,037
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.

388
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:48,042
You fucking believe that? In this day
and age? What is this world coming to?

389
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:53,384
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

390
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:58,515
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
So you come along for her friend.

391
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,987
See? I knew it. I knew it.

392
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:03,323
What the fuck is wrong with that?

393
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,466
- When is this?
- Tomorrow night.

394
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm meeting Tuddy.

395
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:10,064
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.

396
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:12,566
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

397
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:17,211
What did I ask you for? A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

398
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:19,980
I'm trying to bang this broad.
Help me out.

399
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,415
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!

400
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:28,155
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

401
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:32,850
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

402
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:35,188
You with your fucking mouth!

403
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:44,530
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11 and
here I am a backup guy for Tommy.

404
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,172
You have enough to eat?

405
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:49,808
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.

406
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:51,275
Let me watch your figure.

407
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:55,746
I couldn't wait to get away. I was
ordering dessert when they ate dinner.

408
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:59,353
When they had coffee,
I was asking for a check.

409
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:01,613
Some coffee will wake you up.

410
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,122
Joe, can we have the check?

411
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,624
What are you doing?

412
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,126
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

413
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:10,628
I got that thing.

414
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,434
We'll leave together.

415
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:17,204
This way we don't go out like a
bunch of hobos, one at a time.

416
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,837
I couldn't stand him.

417
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:24,840
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.

418
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,938
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

419
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:35,851
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

420
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:39,323
- Ready?
- Lighten up.

421
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:42,156
We just got here. What are you doing?

422
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,493
Before it was time to go,
he was pushing me into the car...

423
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:50,331
...then pulling me out.
It was ridiculous.

424
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:54,506
Diane and Tommy made us promise
to meet them again Friday.

425
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,173
We agreed.

426
00:29:56,444 --> 00:30:00,005
But when Friday came around,
Henry stood me up.

427
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,341
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.

428
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:06,348
All he did was talk about her.
He liked you.

429
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:08,887
We were a trio instead of a double date.

430
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:12,186
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

431
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,329
But I made Tommy take
me looking for him.

432
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:21,362
Tommy, what the fuck?

433
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:24,198
You got some nerve standing me up.

434
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,006
Nobody does that to me.

435
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:29,540
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some big shot?!

436
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,544
I forgot. I thought it was next week.

437
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:37,674
It was this Friday and you
agreed, so you're a liar!

438
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:39,519
We can talk about this.

439
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:43,551
Talk to you after what
you just did to me?

440
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,056
Forget it.

441
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:50,059
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You said nothing.

442
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,066
Let me make it up to you.

443
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:55,934
I'll think about it.

444
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,528
I remember, she's screaming
on the street and I mean loud.

445
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,936
- But she looked good.
- I'll think about it.

446
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:04,874
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

447
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:08,115
She had these great eyes,
like Liz Taylor's.

448
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:12,745
Ready?

449
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:14,353
Come on.

450
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:15,887
Wait a minute.

451
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:20,088
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...

452
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:22,396
Mom.

453
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:24,531
Meet my friend, Henry Hill.

454
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,929
My daughter says you're half Jewish.

455
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:31,765
It's just the good half.

456
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:34,908
See you later.

457
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,370
You're leaving your car?

458
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:39,079
He watches the car for me.

459
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,915
It's easier than leaving it at a garage.

460
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:44,615
It's a lot quicker this way.

461
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,793
This way. It's better
than waiting in line.

462
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:21,486
Every time I come here.
Every time, you two. Don't you work?

463
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:14,341
Henry, nice to see you.
Hi, how are you?

464
00:33:14,642 --> 00:33:16,473
Anthony, right in the front.

465
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,043
Anything you need, let me know.

466
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,593
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

467
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:50,400
You gave them $20 each.

468
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,906
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

469
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,588
What do you do?

470
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,784
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

471
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:09,753
They don't feel like
you're in construction.

472
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:11,588
I'm a union delegate.

473
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:14,299
Ladies and gentlemen...

474
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:18,938
...the Copacabana is proud to
present the king of one-liners...

475
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,934
...Henry Youngman.

476
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:31,442
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

477
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,816
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

478
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,294
I said, " Where do you wanna go
for our anniversary?"

479
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,296
She said,
"Let's go somewhere I've never been."

480
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,328
I said, "Try the kitchen."

481
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,801
Dr. Wellsler is here.

482
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:50,570
Gave a guy 6 months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

483
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,332
Gave him 6 more months.

484
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,841
I love this crowd.

485
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,190
Air France made me.

486
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:17,124
We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

487
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,425
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

488
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,840
60,000.

489
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,869
It'll be a good summer.

490
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,972
I'm proud of you. This is a
lot of money for a kid like you.

491
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:39,480
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps.

492
00:35:43,324 --> 00:35:44,484
Check, sir.

493
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,724
You have to sign for it here.

494
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,039
- How are you?
- Okay. And you?

495
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,345
Henry, this is Bruce.

496
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,918
I'll see you around later.

497
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,151
Do you know him?

498
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,058
He lives across the street.

499
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,669
Roses are red, my love

500
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:32,532
Violets are blue

501
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:37,909
Sugar is sweet, my love

502
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,248
But not as sweet as you

503
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:52,085
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

504
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,896
I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

505
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:58,463
A 21-year-old kid with such connections.

506
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,604
He was an exciting guy.

507
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,469
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

508
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,277
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

509
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,746
He knew how to handle it.

510
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:24,224
Don't buy wigs that come
off at the wrong time.

511
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,450
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

512
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,121
Even underwater.

513
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,933
And remember, Morrie's wigs are
tested against hurricane winds.

514
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:36,831
Forget about money.
You can afford a Morrie wig.

515
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:38,666
Call me now!

516
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,308
Come in for a personalized fitting.

517
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:48,638
Morrie, Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

518
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,781
I've been good to you.

519
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:54,081
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

520
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,516
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

521
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,522
Give 8 to 5 on Cleveland.

522
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,522
I never had to pay the
vigorish he demands.

523
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,130
What am I, a schmuck?

524
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:06,900
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

525
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,592
I didn't agree to 3
points above the vig.

526
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:11,704
What are you going to do? Are you
going to fight with Jimmy Conway?

527
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,340
Give him his money and we'll go.

528
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,668
Fuck him!

529
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,175
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

530
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,879
Did I ever bust his balls?

531
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:23,506
I could've dropped a dime
a million times.

532
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,881
Don't call the cops.
You're talking crazy.

533
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,720
You got money for that commercial!

534
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,018
You don't got my fucking money?

535
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:34,889
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

536
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:38,621
I'll fucking kill you!
Give me the money, cocksucker.

537
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,025
Pay me!

538
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,733
He'll pay, he'll pay.

539
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,737
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

540
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:52,412
You should be sorry. Don't do it again.
Give me my fucking money!

541
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,409
You hear me?!
Give me the fucking money!

542
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,417
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

543
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,418
Karen, slow down.

544
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,892
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

545
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,728
It's Karen.

546
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,905
What happened?

547
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:24,905
What happened? Are you all right?

548
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:26,710
Who did it?

549
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:31,613
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

550
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,620
He started to touch me. He grabbed me.

551
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,623
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

552
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:47,027
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

553
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,237
He pushed me out of the car.

554
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,106
You sure you're all right?

555
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,076
Why don't you go inside and get
yourself together. Clean up.

556
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:30,303
What do you want, fucko?

557
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:41,516
I swear on my mother, if you
touch her again, you're dead.

558
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,689
Don't shoot.

559
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:07,338
Hide this. Are you all right?
Are you all right?

560
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:13,884
I know there are women...

561
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:17,252
...who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...

562
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:20,655
...gave them a gun to hide.
But I didn't.

563
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,562
I got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.

564
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:08,604
Why don't you be like Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

565
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:12,073
He's settling down. He's married.

566
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:14,281
Soon he'll have a nice family.

567
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,779
And you're still bouncing
around from girl to girl.

568
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,626
It was like he had two families.

569
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:32,888
The first time I was introduced to
all of them at once, it was crazy.

570
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:36,430
Paulie and his brothers had
lots of sons and nephews.

571
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:39,937
Almost all of them were
named Peter or Paul.

572
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:42,875
It was unbelievable.

573
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,546
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

574
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,647
There must have been 2 dozen
Peters and Pauls there...

575
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:51,009
This is Marie.

576
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:53,652
...all married to girls named Marie.

577
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:56,116
She looks Italian.

578
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,259
And they named their daughters Marie.

579
00:43:00,961 --> 00:43:04,761
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

580
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:08,833
By the time I met everybody,
I thought I was drunk.

581
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:15,571
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

582
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:19,476
Welcome to the family.

583
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,815
Sunday dinner?

584
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:24,450
So beautiful. I want to cry.

585
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:27,146
Something to help you get started.

586
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:46,600
The bag. The bag.

587
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:51,377
The bag with the envelopes
in it, the money.

588
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:55,346
Don't worry. Nobody's
going to steal that here.

589
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:27,805
He didn't call?

590
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:31,912
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?

591
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:35,088
He's a grown-up. He doesn't
have to call every 5 minutes.

592
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:38,051
A grown-up would get you an apartment.

593
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:42,455
Don't start. Mom, you're
the one who wanted us here.

594
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:46,099
You're here a month. Sometimes I
know he doesn't come home at all.

595
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,823
What kind of people are these?

596
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:51,398
- What do you want me to do?
- What can you do?

597
00:44:51,572 --> 00:44:55,872
He's not Jewish. Did you know
what these people were like?

598
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:58,544
Your father never stayed out all night.

599
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,537
Daddy never went out at all, Ma!
Keep out of it!

600
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:04,851
You don't know how I feel!

601
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:08,915
How do you feel now? You don't
know where he is or who he's with!

602
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:11,351
He's with his friends! Dad!

603
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:13,924
Leave him alone. He's suffered enough.

604
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:16,756
He hasn't digested a
decent meal in 6 weeks.

605
00:45:27,274 --> 00:45:30,607
Where were you?!
Why didn't you call?!

606
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:35,108
We were worried! A married man
does not stay out like this!

607
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:39,486
Normal people don't act like this!

608
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:42,115
What's wrong with you?

609
00:45:42,623 --> 00:45:46,457
You're not normal. She's right!
What's wrong with you?!

610
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,625
What kind of person are you?!
What is the matter with you?!

611
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:52,295
What kind of people are they?

612
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:58,131
We weren't married to 9-5 guys.

613
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:01,238
But the first time I realized
how different...

614
00:46:01,308 --> 00:46:03,208
...was when Mickey had a hostess party.

615
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:06,973
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.

616
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:09,045
On the Island. Nice.

617
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:11,477
I'm from Miami. Ever been there?

618
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,151
It's okay, but it's like you
died and woke up in Jew heaven.

619
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:17,556
Stop picking at that.

620
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,485
I'd like to smack his face.

621
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:21,224
The red-haired guy?

622
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:23,555
The guy's hands are all over me.

623
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:27,427
So I say, " Keep your fucking hands
off me or I'll cut them off."

624
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,331
She means it.

625
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:34,974
He's lucky. I just
mention this to Vinnie...

626
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:38,508
How can you mention it?
Vinnie'd kill him.

627
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:42,178
Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard,
then he'll be there for life.

628
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,679
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

629
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:48,882
He was in an argument. A $10
card game. He pulls out a gun.

630
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:53,048
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears...

631
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,593
...she has a heart attack
and drops dead.

632
00:46:57,197 --> 00:47:01,361
Now Jeannie has a husband and son in
jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

633
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:05,097
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

634
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:07,974
Give me a break. She's drunk.

635
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:12,234
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

636
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:17,210
They had bad skin and wore too much
makeup. They didn't look very good.

637
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,887
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...

638
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,388
...was thrown together and cheap.

639
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:25,385
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

640
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,024
She spends her life in a nightgown.

641
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:31,493
The woman is no angel, believe me.

642
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:33,827
They talked about their rotten kids...

643
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:36,970
...and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.

644
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:39,105
And the kids still didn't listen.

645
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:42,639
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

646
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,242
I don't know if I could live like that!

647
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:49,747
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

648
00:47:51,752 --> 00:47:53,720
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

649
00:47:54,254 --> 00:47:57,223
Do you know why Jeannie's
husband went to the can?

650
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:59,549
Because he wanted
to get away from her.

651
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,524
Let me tell you something. Nobody
goes to jail unless they want to.

652
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:06,833
Unless they make themselves get caught.

653
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:12,037
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.

654
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:16,675
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

655
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:19,913
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car.

656
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,239
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

657
00:48:30,457 --> 00:48:33,290
After a while, it got to be all normal.

658
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,293
None of it seemed like crimes.

659
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,598
Henry was just enterprising.

660
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:42,630
He and the guys make bucks
hustling while other guys...

661
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:46,136
...sat on their asses
waiting for handouts.

662
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,303
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
just blue-collar guys...

663
00:48:50,811 --> 00:48:55,475
The only way they could make real
money was to go out and cut corners.

664
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:57,981
Where's the strong box, you varmint?!

665
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:07,126
Don't fucking move! Don't move!

666
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:18,971
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

667
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:21,671
Did you see him give it right over?

668
00:49:22,676 --> 00:49:25,144
Back to the hideout
to split up the loot.

669
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:31,150
We were all very close.

670
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:35,477
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

671
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:40,520
Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

672
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:41,521
Police.

673
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:45,722
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

674
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:47,225
Would you read and sign it?

675
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:49,502
Anywhere?

676
00:49:50,203 --> 00:49:52,364
We have to go through everything.

677
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,266
You want some coffee?

678
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:56,372
No coffee now, thanks.

679
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:59,873
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

680
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,578
There was always some harassment.

681
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:05,579
They wanted to talk to
Henry about this or that.

682
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:08,878
They'd make me sign their
subpoenas or warrants.

683
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:11,657
But mostly they just wanted a handout.

684
00:50:11,892 --> 00:50:14,827
A few bucks to keep things
quiet no matter what they found.

685
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:25,269
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

686
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,267
...used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

687
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,771
On her own floor!
That never made any sense to me.

688
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,112
It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

689
00:50:39,886 --> 00:50:43,845
Happy birthday to you.

690
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:48,851
We always did everything together
and were always in the same crowd.

691
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:53,566
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

692
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:56,566
The women played cards.

693
00:50:56,737 --> 00:51:00,264
When kids were born, Mickey and
Jimmy were the first at the hospital.

694
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:04,240
When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...

695
00:51:04,578 --> 00:51:05,545
...we went together.

696
00:51:05,746 --> 00:51:08,715
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

697
00:51:08,915 --> 00:51:13,375
I began to be proud that my husband
was willing to risk his neck...

698
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,847
...to get us the little extras.

699
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:19,718
But I got Mom to watch
the babies tomorrow night.

700
00:51:19,926 --> 00:51:21,757
- Can't do it.
- Why not?

701
00:51:22,095 --> 00:51:24,928
I just can't. I got something lined up.

702
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:28,234
But tomorrow's the only
night she can do it.

703
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:32,060
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?

704
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:35,734
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.

705
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:38,904
I need money to go shopping.

706
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:40,610
How much?

707
00:51:43,784 --> 00:51:45,251
That much.

708
00:51:49,456 --> 00:51:51,788
This much. Give me a kiss.

709
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:57,123
See you later.

710
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:03,933
All right.

711
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:08,305
I always dreamed the boy
I love would come along

712
00:52:09,142 --> 00:52:12,111
And he'd be tall and
handsome, rich and strong

713
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:37,664
Welcome home, Batts.

714
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:45,672
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

715
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:48,174
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

716
00:52:48,515 --> 00:52:50,244
There's only one Irishman here.

717
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:52,485
It's a celebration.

718
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:55,048
- Top of the morning.
- It's good to be home.

719
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,527
This is my friend Jimmy.

720
00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:04,330
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

721
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:07,197
Tommy. All dressed up.

722
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:09,968
All grown up and doing the town.

723
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:12,839
Forgot you were having a party for him.

724
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:15,705
Come here.

725
00:53:16,076 --> 00:53:18,237
I'll say hello. How are you Billy?

726
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:20,877
I haven't seen you in 6 years.

727
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:25,010
Jesus Christ Almighty.
You look terrific.

728
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,616
Watch the suit.

729
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:30,620
You little prick.
I know you all my life.

730
00:53:31,024 --> 00:53:34,221
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.

731
00:53:34,895 --> 00:53:38,092
If I was gonna bust your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

732
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,768
This kid was great.

733
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:44,901
"Spitshine Tommy."

734
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:49,197
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

735
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:52,010
He was the best. Made a lot of money.

736
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,045
No more shines.

737
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,284
No more shines.

738
00:53:58,585 --> 00:54:01,418
You been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

739
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,316
I don't shine shoes anymore.

740
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:08,016
What's got into you? I'm breaking
your balls a little, that's all.

741
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,454
I'm only kidding with you.

742
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,928
You don't sound like it.
There's people around.

743
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:15,261
I'm kidding. We're having a party.

744
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:19,269
I haven't seen you in a long
time and you get fresh.

745
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:21,270
I don't mean to offend you.

746
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,271
I'm sorry, too.

747
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:30,742
Now go home and get your shine box.

748
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:32,885
Motherfucking mutt!

749
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:34,745
You fucking piece of shit!

750
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:37,283
Come on, come on!

751
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:41,249
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy.

752
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,655
You bought your fucking button!

753
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,626
Don't get nervous.

754
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:49,533
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!

755
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,638
You fucking feel strong?

756
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:56,105
Sorry. Tommy's loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

757
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,708
No disrespect? Are you nuts?

758
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:02,381
Teach this kid some manners.
What's right is right.

759
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:04,617
- You understand?
- It's okay.

760
00:55:05,018 --> 00:55:09,614
We're hugging and kissing over
here and then he acts like a jerk.

761
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,189
You insulted him a little bit.

762
00:55:14,494 --> 00:55:16,724
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

763
00:55:16,963 --> 00:55:18,658
I didn't. Give us a drink.

764
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,498
Drinks on the house.

765
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:24,303
No, have the drink with me.

766
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:28,307
The drinks are on the house.

767
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:32,705
I fucked kids like that
in the can. In the ass.

768
00:55:33,146 --> 00:55:34,977
Fucking break up my party.

769
00:55:41,688 --> 00:55:45,351
You been away for 6 years.
It's different now.

770
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:48,525
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

771
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,425
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

772
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,567
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?

773
00:56:15,188 --> 00:56:17,554
Let me shoot him in his fucking mouth!

774
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,849
Let's shoot him.

775
00:56:37,043 --> 00:56:39,011
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

776
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,577
His crew'll be looking for him.

777
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:48,217
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

778
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,924
I know a place upstate they'll
never find him. More tablecloths.

779
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,186
I didn't want to get
blood on your floor.

780
00:56:59,065 --> 00:57:00,760
Go open your trunk.

781
00:57:05,238 --> 00:57:06,933
We'll get a shovel
at my mother's house.

782
00:57:16,082 --> 00:57:20,451
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her.

783
00:57:22,255 --> 00:57:24,621
Look who's here.

784
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:27,225
What happened?

785
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,258
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.

786
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,498
What happened to him?

787
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,530
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

788
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,635
You, too. How are you?

789
00:57:39,806 --> 00:57:41,103
Why are you up so late?

790
00:57:41,341 --> 00:57:45,539
He came in. Youse came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

791
00:57:45,812 --> 00:57:49,009
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

792
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:52,410
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

793
00:57:52,485 --> 00:57:53,975
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

794
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,612
Youse go inside.

795
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:57,483
This stuff is like lead.

796
00:57:57,657 --> 00:58:00,956
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

797
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:03,956
You haven't called.
Where have you been?

798
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:05,960
I been working nights.

799
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:08,623
And tonight we were out late.

800
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,838
We took a ride out to the
country and hit a deer.

801
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,372
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

802
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:21,309
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay? Just for a while.

803
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:23,308
The poor thing.

804
00:58:23,516 --> 00:58:27,850
We hit the deer and his paw...
What do you call it? The paw.

805
00:58:29,055 --> 00:58:30,647
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

806
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,585
I got to hack it off.

807
00:58:33,693 --> 00:58:35,991
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

808
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:37,696
I'll bring the knife back.

809
00:58:38,398 --> 00:58:40,229
Delicious.

810
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,727
Why not get yourself a nice girl.

811
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:44,765
I do, almost every night.

812
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:47,702
But a girl you could settle down with.

813
00:58:47,907 --> 00:58:52,708
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you! I want to be with you.

814
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:54,176
Settle down.

815
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:57,710
How's your friend Henry?
What's the matter?

816
00:58:57,884 --> 00:58:59,977
What's wrong?
You don't talk much.

817
00:59:00,253 --> 00:59:01,880
Talk. What are you quiet for?

818
00:59:02,188 --> 00:59:04,679
You don't eat much,
you don't talk much.

819
00:59:04,924 --> 00:59:07,085
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

820
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,752
When we were kids, the "compares"
used to visit one another.

821
00:59:11,197 --> 00:59:15,930
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.

822
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:21,033
They say to him, " What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

823
00:59:21,274 --> 00:59:25,438
He says, " What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

824
00:59:25,745 --> 00:59:28,908
So she says, " Shut up!
You're always talking!"

825
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,541
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

826
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:35,584
- Cornuto content.
- That's it.

827
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:38,922
It means he's content to be a jerk.

828
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:41,883
He doesn't care who knows it.

829
00:59:42,228 --> 00:59:44,594
Did Tommy tell you about my painting?

830
00:59:45,932 --> 00:59:47,229
Look at this.

831
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:48,893
It's beautiful.

832
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:52,104
One dog goes one way and
the other goes the other.

833
00:59:52,405 --> 00:59:54,771
One's facing east, the other west.

834
00:59:54,974 --> 00:59:58,410
He's saying, "Whaddya want from me?"
The guy's got a nice head of white hair.

835
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:00,408
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

836
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,307
Looks like someone we know.

837
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,743
Without the beard. It's him.

838
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:10,620
It's him.

839
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:21,058
What is that?

840
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:23,758
For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

841
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:26,905
Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

842
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:30,142
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

843
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:35,107
Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

844
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:38,944
Hits became a habit.
Guys would argue over nothing.

845
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:41,450
Before you knew it, one was dead.

846
01:00:41,654 --> 01:00:42,951
They were shooting
each other all the time.

847
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:47,125
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.

848
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:51,192
We had a serious problem
with Billy Batts.

849
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:55,491
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

850
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:59,398
Batts was part of the Gambino
crew and considered untouchable.

851
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:03,472
Before you touched a made guy,
you needed a good reason.

852
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,973
You had to get an okay...

853
01:01:06,312 --> 01:01:08,678
...or you'd get whacked.

854
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,651
Saturday night was for wives, but...

855
01:01:23,863 --> 01:01:26,491
...Friday at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

856
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:33,002
We saw Sammy Davis, Jr. You got to
see this show. What a performer!

857
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:37,340
He does impersonations.
It was like the real people!

858
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:41,708
Unbelievable. You could see how
a white girl could fall for him.

859
01:01:43,516 --> 01:01:48,180
Not me. But you could see how some
girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

860
01:01:48,521 --> 01:01:50,182
So you condone that stuff.

861
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,189
Take it easy.

862
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,985
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

863
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:57,321
I don't mean me.

864
01:01:59,098 --> 01:02:01,794
But, you know, he's got personality.

865
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,196
"Personality"?

866
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,466
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

867
01:02:07,607 --> 01:02:11,065
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

868
01:02:11,277 --> 01:02:13,768
I just said he was talented.

869
01:02:14,046 --> 01:02:16,514
Just leave it alone now.

870
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:19,214
He's talented. Leave it at that.

871
01:02:19,919 --> 01:02:23,355
Pretend you don't see her, my heart

872
01:02:25,558 --> 01:02:28,391
Although she is coming...

873
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:31,056
Our way

874
01:02:33,132 --> 01:02:36,295
Pretend you don't need her

875
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:38,934
My heart

876
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:43,367
But smile and pretend

877
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:46,241
To be gay

878
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:51,550
It's too late for running...

879
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:54,246
My heart

880
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,588
Chin up if the tears...

881
01:02:59,926 --> 01:03:01,587
Start to fall

882
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:06,924
Look somewhere above her

883
01:03:07,934 --> 01:03:10,903
Pretend you don't love her

884
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,132
Pretend you don't see her

885
01:03:15,942 --> 01:03:17,603
At all.

886
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:59,982
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

887
01:04:16,168 --> 01:04:17,863
What do you hear about that thing?

888
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,402
The Brooklyn thing?

889
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:22,140
The guy from downtown.

890
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,968
The guy from where Christie lived?

891
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:30,676
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

892
01:04:31,183 --> 01:04:32,514
Know the guy I mean?

893
01:04:33,185 --> 01:04:34,413
His name was Batts.

894
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,489
His people are driving everyone
crazy looking for him.

895
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,419
Nobody knows what happened.

896
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:43,651
He came into the joint that
night and then just disappeared.

897
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:48,894
Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

898
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,508
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

899
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:03,942
I want my money.

900
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:07,018
I want my money. He owes it.

901
01:05:15,728 --> 01:05:18,390
You know that thing we
took care of upstate?

902
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:21,465
- Paulie was talking about that.
- We must move it.

903
01:05:21,734 --> 01:05:25,067
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

904
01:05:25,237 --> 01:05:29,196
- It's been 6 months.
- We got to move it right away.

905
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:45,920
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

906
01:05:49,595 --> 01:05:51,756
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny.

907
01:05:51,998 --> 01:05:53,260
Here's a leg.

908
01:05:53,432 --> 01:05:54,763
Here's a wing.

909
01:05:55,768 --> 01:06:00,228
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still prefer the hearts and lungs?

910
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,101
Oh, that's so bad.

911
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:11,780
What happened to the car?

912
01:06:12,284 --> 01:06:13,945
I hit a skunk, all right?

913
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,517
Go with your mother.

914
01:06:17,123 --> 01:06:18,954
It's disgusting, Henry.

915
01:06:23,285 --> 01:06:26,618
I set up Janice in an
apartment near The Suite.

916
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:28,857
That way I was able to stay
over a few nights a week.

917
01:06:29,024 --> 01:06:30,389
My new antique lamp.

918
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:33,789
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

919
01:06:33,962 --> 01:06:35,793
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

920
01:06:36,031 --> 01:06:37,498
Looks like Roma.

921
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,462
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

922
01:06:42,071 --> 01:06:43,698
Come see my bedroom.

923
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:48,533
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

924
01:06:52,448 --> 01:06:54,416
Love that crystal ball or what?

925
01:06:56,085 --> 01:06:58,849
This is where we spend most of our time.

926
01:07:00,756 --> 01:07:03,418
I love the floral arrangements.

927
01:07:05,694 --> 01:07:06,319
French.

928
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:10,259
Janice and I had so much fun,
she screwed up at work.

929
01:07:10,532 --> 01:07:12,500
I had to straighten out her boss.

930
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:15,169
Janice can do what she wants to do!

931
01:07:15,537 --> 01:07:16,663
Got it?!

932
01:07:16,972 --> 01:07:21,068
Just try and run. Hang up once
more and you'll deal with me!

933
01:07:26,882 --> 01:07:29,009
Get off of her.

934
01:07:29,385 --> 01:07:30,716
You're an animal.

935
01:07:43,899 --> 01:07:47,232
Spider, on your way here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

936
01:07:53,909 --> 01:07:56,241
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

937
01:07:56,512 --> 01:07:58,537
Do I stutter? I play those.

938
01:08:02,251 --> 01:08:03,718
What am I, a mirage?

939
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,047
Where's my fucking drink?

940
01:08:07,322 --> 01:08:09,882
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

941
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:12,525
You said, "I'm all right, Spider."

942
01:08:13,762 --> 01:08:15,889
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

943
01:08:16,565 --> 01:08:19,432
No, I heard someone
say "Spider, Spider."

944
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:23,632
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a stuttering fuck.

945
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:25,839
You said, "I'm all right, Spider."

946
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,838
You ain't all right.

947
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:30,237
No, you said you were all right.

948
01:08:30,446 --> 01:08:33,074
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

949
01:08:34,283 --> 01:08:37,912
You been doing this all
night to me, motherfucker!

950
01:08:38,187 --> 01:08:40,451
You want a drink? I'll bring it.

951
01:08:40,589 --> 01:08:43,456
Get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you prick!

952
01:08:43,592 --> 01:08:45,753
You walk like Stepin Fetchit.

953
01:08:46,462 --> 01:08:47,929
Everybody else you run.

954
01:08:48,197 --> 01:08:52,065
Run for me! Dance the
fucking drink back here!

955
01:08:52,301 --> 01:08:53,666
What's that Bogart movie?

956
01:08:53,969 --> 01:08:56,802
- Where he played a cowboy.
- "The Oklahoma Kid."

957
01:08:57,072 --> 01:09:00,872
"Oklahoma Kid." "Shane?"
Oklahoma Kid, that's me.

958
01:09:01,143 --> 01:09:02,770
You fucking varmint. Dance!

959
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:05,539
Yahoo, motherfucker!

960
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:08,775
Round up those fucking wagons.

961
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:15,850
Now he's moving.

962
01:09:18,093 --> 01:09:19,822
He got him in the foot.

963
01:09:19,995 --> 01:09:23,954
He's fine. So he got shot in the foot.
Big fucking deal.

964
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,292
Get a towel.

965
01:09:25,501 --> 01:09:26,832
Nice fucking game.

966
01:09:28,337 --> 01:09:32,967
Take him to Ben Casey. Let him
crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

967
01:09:33,175 --> 01:09:35,143
Take him to the doctor down the street.

968
01:09:36,845 --> 01:09:38,312
Bones are all shattered.

969
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:40,308
Don't get me upset.

970
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:43,618
Don't make a big fucking
thing out of it, Spider!

971
01:09:44,353 --> 01:09:46,981
You trying to make me
think what I did here.

972
01:09:47,356 --> 01:09:48,983
It was an accident.

973
01:09:49,358 --> 01:09:50,985
Little fucking actor.

974
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,218
- You in?
- I'm in.

975
01:09:53,428 --> 01:09:55,396
- 800.
- 800?!

976
01:09:56,365 --> 01:09:59,823
You haven't been home in 2 weeks!
You're not going out tonight!

977
01:10:00,269 --> 01:10:03,432
Will you grow up?!
I'm still going to go out!

978
01:10:03,672 --> 01:10:05,537
Not without your car keys.

979
01:10:05,674 --> 01:10:07,699
Are you nuts? Is that your problem?

980
01:10:08,043 --> 01:10:09,943
Yes! Something's going on!

981
01:10:10,212 --> 01:10:12,942
Stop with that. Enough!
Stop with that!

982
01:10:13,282 --> 01:10:17,218
I look in your face and
I know you're lying!

983
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:21,451
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up!

984
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:22,887
Out of my life!

985
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,719
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.

986
01:10:25,961 --> 01:10:28,395
- You're a lousy bastard!
- You got a problem.

987
01:10:29,231 --> 01:10:32,257
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

988
01:10:32,701 --> 01:10:36,193
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

989
01:10:46,715 --> 01:10:48,273
Spider, what's your rush?

990
01:10:51,787 --> 01:10:52,947
Thank you.

991
01:10:53,255 --> 01:10:57,589
Spider, that bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

992
01:10:59,561 --> 01:11:02,928
Next thing you know he'll have
one of these fucking walkers.

993
01:11:03,265 --> 01:11:05,096
But you can still dance.

994
01:11:05,334 --> 01:11:10,169
Give us a couple of fucking steps,
Spider. You fucking bullshitter.

995
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:12,464
Tell the truth. You want sympathy.

996
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:14,402
Got fuck yourself, Tommy.

997
01:11:19,448 --> 01:11:20,813
I didn't hear right.

998
01:11:21,016 --> 01:11:22,608
I can't believe what I heard.

999
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:24,282
This is for you.

1000
01:11:25,454 --> 01:11:28,480
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.

1001
01:11:28,757 --> 01:11:30,782
Good. Don't take shit from nobody.

1002
01:11:31,293 --> 01:11:33,727
He tells him to go fuck himself.

1003
01:11:36,198 --> 01:11:40,134
Tommy, you going to let this
fucking punk get away with that?

1004
01:11:40,369 --> 01:11:41,996
What's this world coming to?

1005
01:11:46,675 --> 01:11:49,143
That's what the fucking
world's coming to.

1006
01:11:49,478 --> 01:11:51,207
- How's that?
- What is wrong with you?!

1007
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,847
What is the fucking matter with you?!
Are you stupid or what?

1008
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:58,453
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?

1009
01:11:58,687 --> 01:12:01,178
How do I know you're kidding?

1010
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:04,391
I'm kidding with you, you
fucking shoot the guy?!

1011
01:12:04,559 --> 01:12:05,651
He's dead.

1012
01:12:07,329 --> 01:12:09,456
Good shot. I'm a good shot.

1013
01:12:09,698 --> 01:12:13,566
- Hard to miss at this distance.
- You got a problem with what I did?

1014
01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:17,637
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1015
01:12:18,573 --> 01:12:20,598
Stupid bastard! I can't believe you.

1016
01:12:20,876 --> 01:12:24,471
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1017
01:12:24,713 --> 01:12:28,649
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1018
01:12:28,884 --> 01:12:32,320
Not the first hole I dug.
Where are the shovels?

1019
01:12:34,737 --> 01:12:37,433
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.

1020
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:41,267
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1021
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:43,106
I want to talk to you!

1022
01:12:43,379 --> 01:12:46,871
You keep away from my
husband, you hear me?

1023
01:12:48,585 --> 01:12:50,109
Open the door!

1024
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:53,217
Answer me!

1025
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:56,518
I'll tell everyone who walks in here...

1026
01:12:56,693 --> 01:12:59,389
...that in 2R, Rossi, you
are nothing but a whore!

1027
01:12:59,529 --> 01:13:00,894
Superintendent?

1028
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:03,690
I want you to know you have a whore...

1029
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,059
...in 2R!

1030
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:13,238
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!

1031
01:13:14,444 --> 01:13:15,911
Wake up.

1032
01:13:29,525 --> 01:13:30,389
What are you doing?

1033
01:13:33,796 --> 01:13:35,423
Are you crazy?

1034
01:13:35,732 --> 01:13:36,994
I am crazy.

1035
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:40,469
And I'm crazy enough
to kill both of you.

1036
01:13:43,573 --> 01:13:45,336
Karen, take it easy.

1037
01:13:49,445 --> 01:13:51,106
Do you love her?

1038
01:13:52,348 --> 01:13:53,474
Do you?!

1039
01:13:54,584 --> 01:13:56,017
Do you?

1040
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:01,287
I love you. You know I love you.

1041
01:14:02,592 --> 01:14:03,752
You don't.

1042
01:14:05,828 --> 01:14:07,489
No, you don't.

1043
01:14:08,665 --> 01:14:11,190
Be careful, baby. Don't.

1044
01:14:11,601 --> 01:14:15,435
But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?

1045
01:14:17,974 --> 01:14:19,601
The truth was...

1046
01:14:19,842 --> 01:14:21,605
...no matter how bad I felt...

1047
01:14:22,612 --> 01:14:25,046
...I was still very attracted to him.

1048
01:14:26,315 --> 01:14:28,442
Why give him to someone else?

1049
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:30,619
Why should she win?

1050
01:14:34,524 --> 01:14:39,223
Just put it down.
You know I love you, don't you?

1051
01:14:40,329 --> 01:14:42,160
You're all I want, Karen.

1052
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,531
Please put the gun down.

1053
01:14:46,703 --> 01:14:48,796
Baby, come on.

1054
01:15:05,354 --> 01:15:09,415
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1055
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:13,493
I got to fucking come home for this?!

1056
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:15,922
I should fucking kill you!

1057
01:15:17,366 --> 01:15:18,663
How does it feel?

1058
01:15:20,203 --> 01:15:21,830
How does it feel, Karen?

1059
01:15:39,522 --> 01:15:41,217
I'm sorry!

1060
01:15:47,864 --> 01:15:49,923
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1061
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,760
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1062
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,701
Go get some cigarettes, okay?

1063
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:03,612
- Anybody else?
- I'm all right.

1064
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:06,078
You want anything to drink?

1065
01:16:06,949 --> 01:16:08,314
Chinese food?

1066
01:16:16,425 --> 01:16:17,722
Karen came by.

1067
01:16:18,895 --> 01:16:20,260
She's very upset.

1068
01:16:20,463 --> 01:16:22,328
You got to straighten this out.

1069
01:16:22,632 --> 01:16:25,795
We got to have calm.
We don't know what she'll do.

1070
01:16:26,102 --> 01:16:28,263
She's hysterical. Very excited.

1071
01:16:28,471 --> 01:16:32,965
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1072
01:16:33,342 --> 01:16:36,743
I'm not saying go back to her
right now, but you got to go back.

1073
01:16:36,979 --> 01:16:39,174
You got to keep up appearances.

1074
01:16:39,348 --> 01:16:42,112
The two of them come
to my house every day.

1075
01:16:42,351 --> 01:16:44,478
I just can't have it.

1076
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:47,985
I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it.

1077
01:16:48,357 --> 01:16:50,655
Nobody says you can't do what you want.

1078
01:16:50,993 --> 01:16:55,362
We all know that. This is what it is.
We know what it is.

1079
01:16:55,598 --> 01:16:58,931
You have to do what's right.
You have to go home to the family.

1080
01:16:59,202 --> 01:17:01,670
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1081
01:17:02,205 --> 01:17:04,298
You got to go home. Smarten up.

1082
01:17:06,776 --> 01:17:08,141
I'll talk to Karen.

1083
01:17:08,444 --> 01:17:11,777
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1084
01:17:12,949 --> 01:17:17,215
I'll say you'll go back to her and it'll
be like when you first got married.

1085
01:17:17,453 --> 01:17:19,614
I'll romance her. It'll be beautiful.

1086
01:17:19,956 --> 01:17:21,617
I know how to talk to her.

1087
01:17:21,858 --> 01:17:25,624
In the meantime, Jimmy and Tommy
were going to Tampa this weekend.

1088
01:17:25,862 --> 01:17:27,386
Instead you go with Jimmy.

1089
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:28,961
You come with me.

1090
01:17:29,232 --> 01:17:31,029
Have a good time.

1091
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:33,702
Sit in the sun. Take a few days off.

1092
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:35,460
We'll have a good time.

1093
01:17:35,638 --> 01:17:37,970
After that, you'll go back to Karen.

1094
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:40,869
There's no other way.

1095
01:17:41,177 --> 01:17:43,475
No divorce. We're not animali.

1096
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,542
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1097
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:49,878
She'll kill him, but not divorce him.

1098
01:17:55,825 --> 01:17:57,258
You going to pay it?

1099
01:18:04,734 --> 01:18:06,065
Give us the money!

1100
01:18:20,383 --> 01:18:22,578
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.

1101
01:18:23,519 --> 01:18:25,919
Lions? I ain't going near any lions!

1102
01:18:26,222 --> 01:18:27,519
Throw him over the moat.

1103
01:18:28,024 --> 01:18:30,083
I'll get the money!

1104
01:18:30,393 --> 01:18:34,591
They must really feed each other to the
lions, 'cause he gave the money right up.

1105
01:18:34,864 --> 01:18:36,229
I'll get the money.

1106
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:39,027
We spent the rest of the
weekend at the track.

1107
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:43,532
Then, I couldn't believe what happened.

1108
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:46,534
When we got home, we were
all over the newspaper.

1109
01:18:49,946 --> 01:18:52,312
Then I found out the
guy we roughed up...

1110
01:18:55,785 --> 01:18:58,549
I couldn't believe it. Of all people.

1111
01:18:58,788 --> 01:19:01,723
She gave up everybody.
Jimmy, me. Even her brother.

1112
01:19:03,459 --> 01:19:06,326
It took the jury 6 hours
to bring us in guilty.

1113
01:19:06,562 --> 01:19:09,326
The judge gave us 10 years
like he was giving away candy.

1114
01:19:09,565 --> 01:19:11,795
10 years in a federal penitentiary.

1115
01:19:12,735 --> 01:19:14,566
You will now be turned over...

1116
01:19:14,804 --> 01:19:16,431
...to the Attorney General.

1117
01:19:21,344 --> 01:19:25,474
Toast, guys. Good trip,
good life. Get out soon.

1118
01:19:25,748 --> 01:19:27,147
Good trip, sweetheart.

1119
01:19:33,823 --> 01:19:36,348
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1120
01:19:37,426 --> 01:19:39,986
Motherfuck them every chance you get.

1121
01:20:01,517 --> 01:20:02,643
Take me to jail.

1122
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:09,953
In prison, dinner was
always a big thing.

1123
01:20:10,459 --> 01:20:14,122
We had a pasta course, then
we had a meat or a fish.

1124
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,030
Paulie was doing a year for contempt...

1125
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,699
...and had a wonderful
system for garlic.

1126
01:20:20,202 --> 01:20:22,966
He used a razor and sliced it so thin...

1127
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:27,876
It's a very good system.

1128
01:20:28,544 --> 01:20:31,035
Vinnie was in charge
of the tomato sauce.

1129
01:20:31,414 --> 01:20:32,881
Get that smell?

1130
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:37,648
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs.
Veal, beef, and pork.

1131
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:39,479
You got to have pork.

1132
01:20:40,356 --> 01:20:41,653
That's the flavor.

1133
01:20:41,891 --> 01:20:45,987
I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a good sauce.

1134
01:20:48,664 --> 01:20:51,155
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1135
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:55,732
- There are only 3 small onions.
- Three onions? How many tomatoes?

1136
01:20:56,005 --> 01:20:58,235
- Two big cans.
- You don't need 3 onions.

1137
01:20:59,175 --> 01:21:00,733
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1138
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:03,743
We had no broiler, so he
did everything in pans.

1139
01:21:04,013 --> 01:21:07,176
It smelled up the joint and
the hacks used to die...

1140
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:09,247
...but he cooked a great steak.

1141
01:21:12,755 --> 01:21:15,246
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1142
01:21:15,524 --> 01:21:19,016
When you think of prison you
get pictures in your mind...

1143
01:21:19,261 --> 01:21:22,753
...of all those old movies with
rows and rows of guys behind bars.

1144
01:21:23,032 --> 01:21:25,193
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1145
01:21:25,434 --> 01:21:29,097
It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy,
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1146
01:21:29,405 --> 01:21:31,270
Give me two steaks.

1147
01:21:32,942 --> 01:21:37,777
Everyone else in the joint was doing
real time, all together, living like pigs.

1148
01:21:38,047 --> 01:21:40,777
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1149
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:44,451
We batted them sons-of-bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1150
01:21:45,955 --> 01:21:49,447
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
wouldn't rat on the guys we did.

1151
01:21:49,725 --> 01:21:52,216
People used to be able to
leave their door open.

1152
01:21:52,461 --> 01:21:56,227
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.

1153
01:21:56,432 --> 01:21:59,424
- We have to take care of that bastard.
- I took care of him.

1154
01:21:59,902 --> 01:22:01,233
What'd you bring?

1155
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,071
I got peppers and onions.

1156
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:08,642
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1157
01:22:08,844 --> 01:22:09,776
What else?

1158
01:22:10,312 --> 01:22:11,643
Scotch.

1159
01:22:14,984 --> 01:22:17,077
- Now we can eat.
- Some white, too.

1160
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,754
Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.

1161
01:22:33,769 --> 01:22:35,259
Read'em and weep.

1162
01:22:38,007 --> 01:22:39,338
What are you doing?

1163
01:22:49,185 --> 01:22:51,016
I'll catch you guys later.

1164
01:22:51,453 --> 01:22:52,852
Going to the park?

1165
01:22:55,858 --> 01:22:57,189
I'll catch you next week.

1166
01:23:19,915 --> 01:23:21,576
You girls stay right here.

1167
01:23:22,184 --> 01:23:24,516
- Hold hands.
- Go right up front.

1168
01:23:42,204 --> 01:23:43,102
What?

1169
01:23:43,272 --> 01:23:45,433
I saw her name on the register.

1170
01:23:45,941 --> 01:23:47,431
Want her to visit?

1171
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:51,043
Let her stay up all night
writing to the parole board.

1172
01:23:51,213 --> 01:23:54,376
What am I doing here?
Where am I?! I'm in jail.

1173
01:23:54,617 --> 01:23:56,710
I can't stop people from visiting me.

1174
01:23:56,952 --> 01:24:00,615
Let her sneak this stuff
in for you every week.

1175
01:24:01,457 --> 01:24:03,322
Let her fight these bastards every week!

1176
01:24:06,128 --> 01:24:07,288
I'm sorry.

1177
01:24:07,963 --> 01:24:10,056
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1178
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:13,795
Will you stop it?

1179
01:24:14,069 --> 01:24:16,799
- Let her do it!
- Stop it!

1180
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,981
Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.

1181
01:24:28,984 --> 01:24:31,077
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1182
01:24:31,453 --> 01:24:34,650
I asked your friend Remo
for the money he owes you.

1183
01:24:35,157 --> 01:24:39,992
He told me to take the kids down to
the police station and get on welfare.

1184
01:24:40,162 --> 01:24:41,925
It's going to be okay.

1185
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:46,658
I never even see Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.

1186
01:24:46,835 --> 01:24:50,100
That's what happens when you go away.

1187
01:24:50,272 --> 01:24:53,935
We're on our own. Forget
everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1188
01:24:54,476 --> 01:24:57,775
As long as he's on parole he
doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1189
01:25:03,519 --> 01:25:05,885
All I need is you to
bring me this stuff.

1190
01:25:06,121 --> 01:25:08,851
A guy from Pittsburgh
will help me move it.

1191
01:25:09,124 --> 01:25:11,854
In a month we'll be fine.
We won't need anybody.

1192
01:25:12,127 --> 01:25:13,185
I'm afraid.

1193
01:25:13,362 --> 01:25:15,125
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1194
01:25:15,364 --> 01:25:17,491
He is not helping us.

1195
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,030
Is he putting any food on the table?

1196
01:25:21,503 --> 01:25:23,437
We've got to help each other.

1197
01:25:23,706 --> 01:25:27,369
We got to be really, really
careful while we do it.

1198
01:25:31,513 --> 01:25:33,640
I don't want to hear about her anymore.

1199
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:05,743
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?

1200
01:26:06,014 --> 01:26:09,415
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1201
01:26:09,685 --> 01:26:11,175
I did the sun.

1202
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:15,220
My chorus concert is in 2 weeks.
Are you coming?

1203
01:26:16,024 --> 01:26:17,685
Do you like the house?

1204
01:26:19,194 --> 01:26:22,357
- Get packed. We're moving out.
- With what?

1205
01:26:22,564 --> 01:26:25,692
Don't worry. Just start
looking for a new house.

1206
01:26:29,204 --> 01:26:31,263
We'll be okay. I got things lined up.

1207
01:26:31,507 --> 01:26:34,203
Pittsburgh? You have to
see your parole officer.

1208
01:26:34,443 --> 01:26:36,035
Don't worry about it.

1209
01:26:36,278 --> 01:26:39,714
Everything will be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?

1210
01:26:50,459 --> 01:26:52,120
What do you want?

1211
01:26:52,428 --> 01:26:55,056
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1212
01:26:58,133 --> 01:27:01,227
You look good. Did we eat
this good in the joint?

1213
01:27:03,071 --> 01:27:04,732
I don't want any more of that shit.

1214
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:08,405
- What are you talking about?
- Just stay away from the garbage.

1215
01:27:09,244 --> 01:27:11,735
Inside, you did what you had to do.

1216
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:14,915
I'm talking about now.
About here and now.

1217
01:27:16,151 --> 01:27:18,551
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk of me.

1218
01:27:18,821 --> 01:27:20,311
Just don't do it.

1219
01:27:21,156 --> 01:27:22,316
Don't.

1220
01:27:24,259 --> 01:27:26,989
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.

1221
01:27:27,429 --> 01:27:30,262
He's a good earner, but
takes too many chances.

1222
01:27:30,566 --> 01:27:32,761
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.

1223
01:27:32,935 --> 01:27:36,564
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.
He's got too much to prove.

1224
01:27:36,939 --> 01:27:40,466
- You got to watch out for them.
- I only use them for certain things.

1225
01:27:48,784 --> 01:27:52,185
So I'm warning everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1226
01:27:53,188 --> 01:27:57,591
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying
hello to some fuck who was selling junk.

1227
01:27:58,026 --> 01:28:00,494
That won't happen to me, understand?

1228
01:28:00,796 --> 01:28:03,128
You're out early
because I got you a job.

1229
01:28:03,298 --> 01:28:04,856
I don't need this heat.

1230
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,668
You see anybody with shit you tell me.

1231
01:28:12,441 --> 01:28:13,931
Of course.

1232
01:28:20,782 --> 01:28:24,274
It took me a week of sneaking around
to unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1233
01:28:24,453 --> 01:28:27,013
But when I did, it was a real score.

1234
01:28:27,456 --> 01:28:30,016
I used Sandy's place to mix the stuff.

1235
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:35,127
Even with Sandy snorting more than she
mixed, I saw this was a good business.

1236
01:28:35,497 --> 01:28:38,193
I made $12,000 in my second week.

1237
01:28:38,433 --> 01:28:41,664
I had a down payment on my
house and things were rolling.

1238
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:45,371
All I had to do was once in a
while tell Sandy I loved her.

1239
01:28:49,811 --> 01:28:51,608
It was perfect.

1240
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:56,044
Since I got the stuff from Pittsburgh,
Paulie would never find out.

1241
01:28:56,318 --> 01:29:00,379
Within a couple of weeks it
got so big I needed some help.

1242
01:29:00,622 --> 01:29:03,386
I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

1243
01:29:12,467 --> 01:29:14,162
You bring your pay slips?

1244
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:20,233
Four and a half months of dirt.

1245
01:29:20,475 --> 01:29:23,171
- It's so good.
- I did it.

1246
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:26,411
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.

1247
01:29:27,182 --> 01:29:30,709
This we had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it.

1248
01:29:31,019 --> 01:29:33,544
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1249
01:29:33,855 --> 01:29:35,413
Okay, ready?

1250
01:29:35,657 --> 01:29:37,852
Watch the wall with the rock.

1251
01:29:44,866 --> 01:29:48,199
The electricians did
it special. Come on.

1252
01:29:50,572 --> 01:29:55,032
This was imported. It came in 2 pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1253
01:29:55,277 --> 01:29:58,508
- Nice, huh?
- Come here. Did you and Jimmy talk?

1254
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,212
He's looking into everything.

1255
01:30:01,383 --> 01:30:03,681
It'll make Air France look like peanuts.

1256
01:30:05,754 --> 01:30:07,881
- He'll do it, right?
- I told you.

1257
01:30:08,123 --> 01:30:11,684
He's looking into it. We'll
see what happens. No promises.

1258
01:30:12,594 --> 01:30:15,757
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.

1259
01:30:16,064 --> 01:30:19,591
I've been cultivating this
son-of-a-bitch for 2 years.

1260
01:30:19,901 --> 01:30:23,701
He owes me 20 grand. Once in a
lifetime. I could retire.

1261
01:30:28,143 --> 01:30:29,440
Let's get a drink.

1262
01:30:29,778 --> 01:30:32,679
These are the guys Jimmy put together
for what turned out to be...

1263
01:30:32,748 --> 01:30:37,549
...the biggest heist in American
history. The Lufthansa heist.

1264
01:30:38,253 --> 01:30:42,713
Tommy and Carbone would grab the guard
and make him get us in the front door.

1265
01:30:44,793 --> 01:30:48,092
Frenchy and Joe Buddha had
to round up the workers.

1266
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:52,794
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them
tied up and away from the alarms.

1267
01:30:53,435 --> 01:30:55,460
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1268
01:30:55,737 --> 01:30:59,434
He used to play guitar at the lounge.
Everybody loved Stacks.

1269
01:31:01,943 --> 01:31:05,106
...and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours in Jersey.

1270
01:31:05,347 --> 01:31:07,941
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1271
01:31:08,183 --> 01:31:09,741
Have a drink and shut up.

1272
01:31:10,018 --> 01:31:11,747
Just because he set this up...

1273
01:31:11,953 --> 01:31:15,480
...he bugged Jimmy for an advance
on the money we could steal.

1274
01:31:16,024 --> 01:31:20,358
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.

1275
01:31:26,668 --> 01:31:30,832
I had everyone working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.

1276
01:31:33,608 --> 01:31:34,973
Have a good flight?

1277
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:37,838
I hate Pittsburgh. They're such creeps.

1278
01:31:38,146 --> 01:31:40,046
They're not that bad.

1279
01:31:41,049 --> 01:31:42,983
And it's worth it.

1280
01:31:43,318 --> 01:31:45,684
Is this the same baby
you used last week?

1281
01:31:45,854 --> 01:31:49,312
No, that was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1282
01:31:51,326 --> 01:31:52,987
She looks like you.

1283
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:55,527
That's what the stewardess said.

1284
01:32:08,643 --> 01:32:10,338
Take it easy.

1285
01:32:10,645 --> 01:32:12,704
Give me a break. You got plenty.

1286
01:32:13,248 --> 01:32:16,809
You got all day. Let's make it
last, all right? Take it easy.

1287
01:32:19,421 --> 01:32:23,721
Don't start. You know I got to go
do this thing. Where are my keys?

1288
01:32:24,826 --> 01:32:26,088
Over there.

1289
01:32:26,361 --> 01:32:30,024
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.
I got you a dishwasher.

1290
01:32:30,265 --> 01:32:31,664
Fucks up my nails.

1291
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:33,892
You got to be smart.

1292
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:38,497
Loosen up.

1293
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,435
What are you doing?

1294
01:32:42,677 --> 01:32:44,907
You don't have to go anywhere.

1295
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:47,211
Make them wait.

1296
01:32:56,391 --> 01:32:59,849
Nobody knows for sure how much
was taken in the pre-dawn raid...

1297
01:33:00,128 --> 01:33:02,688
...at the Lufthansa cargo terminal.

1298
01:33:02,931 --> 01:33:06,298
The FBI says $2,000,000, Port
Authority says $4,000,000.

1299
01:33:12,073 --> 01:33:13,938
Those sons-of-bitches!

1300
01:33:14,242 --> 01:33:16,540
...the scene of the heist at JFK.

1301
01:33:16,778 --> 01:33:20,441
It looks like a big one. Maybe the
biggest this town has ever seen.

1302
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:24,442
Come here, you! Come here!

1303
01:33:25,453 --> 01:33:28,547
Look at this genius. This genius!

1304
01:33:32,627 --> 01:33:34,151
Merry Christmas, Jimmy!

1305
01:33:39,334 --> 01:33:42,167
- Who's this?
- This is my wife.

1306
01:33:43,271 --> 01:33:46,104
Come here. I want to show
you something, Jimmy.

1307
01:33:48,176 --> 01:33:52,806
Isn't she gorgeous? I bought it for my
wife. It's a coupe. I love that car.

1308
01:33:55,984 --> 01:33:58,817
What did I tell you?
I talked to you, didn't I?

1309
01:34:03,358 --> 01:34:07,818
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.

1310
01:34:08,129 --> 01:34:10,996
- I love that car.
- Excuse me for a second.

1311
01:34:11,299 --> 01:34:13,426
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?

1312
01:34:13,668 --> 01:34:16,432
- Why are you getting excited?
- Are you stupid?

1313
01:34:16,605 --> 01:34:19,938
We got a million bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.

1314
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:23,302
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1315
01:34:31,786 --> 01:34:33,310
What are you getting excited for?

1316
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:36,615
Because you're going
to get us all pinched.

1317
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:39,688
- What's the matter with you?
- I apologize.

1318
01:34:41,029 --> 01:34:43,463
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with you?!

1319
01:34:50,538 --> 01:34:51,300
I'm sorry.

1320
01:34:52,941 --> 01:34:54,101
It's under my mother's name.

1321
01:34:54,643 --> 01:34:57,237
What'd you say? You being a wiseguy?!

1322
01:34:57,545 --> 01:35:00,537
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- What did I tell you?

1323
01:35:04,185 --> 01:35:05,812
You don't buy anything.

1324
01:35:05,987 --> 01:35:07,477
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1325
01:35:10,558 --> 01:35:12,423
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.

1326
01:35:20,435 --> 01:35:22,562
I can't believe this. Are you stupid?

1327
01:35:22,837 --> 01:35:23,735
Excuse me.

1328
01:35:28,677 --> 01:35:30,269
Take it off.

1329
01:35:31,579 --> 01:35:35,276
Didn't I tell you not to get
anything big or attract attention?

1330
01:35:35,517 --> 01:35:38,680
One guy gets a Caddy and
one gets a $20,000 mink.

1331
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,012
I'll return it.

1332
01:35:40,221 --> 01:35:45,022
Bring it where you got it. Get it out
of here. Understand? Get it out of here!

1333
01:35:56,304 --> 01:35:59,102
This drink here is
better that sex, babe.

1334
01:36:00,775 --> 01:36:05,109
I'm going to see Stacks. Don't you
look at anybody or I'll kill you.

1335
01:36:05,413 --> 01:36:09,440
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1336
01:36:09,718 --> 01:36:11,049
That's great.

1337
01:36:11,419 --> 01:36:14,877
I tell them all not to attract
attention. What do they do?

1338
01:36:20,729 --> 01:36:22,959
Listen, I need the money.

1339
01:36:23,431 --> 01:36:26,559
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- I need the money.

1340
01:36:27,435 --> 01:36:29,062
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1341
01:36:29,904 --> 01:36:32,464
- I did what I had to do.
- Not tonight, Morrie.

1342
01:36:32,741 --> 01:36:35,141
I did my caper. He owes me.

1343
01:36:35,443 --> 01:36:39,641
Everyone's flashing stuff. They got
money. I'm wearing the same shit.

1344
01:36:39,914 --> 01:36:42,974
They're wearing it.
I got to talk to him.

1345
01:36:48,456 --> 01:36:50,651
The biggest bundle he made in his life.

1346
01:36:50,925 --> 01:36:53,155
I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink.

1347
01:36:53,428 --> 01:36:55,293
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison to my eyes.

1348
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:58,364
- Morris, are you all right?
- No.

1349
01:37:17,952 --> 01:37:19,681
- Who is it?
- It's me.

1350
01:37:19,954 --> 01:37:22,115
Pete? One second.

1351
01:37:22,524 --> 01:37:26,392
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron.

1352
01:37:27,996 --> 01:37:30,760
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1353
01:37:31,099 --> 01:37:33,829
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1354
01:37:35,437 --> 01:37:38,929
- What do you think, Mommy?
- I love them all.

1355
01:37:39,174 --> 01:37:40,607
I love the gold outfit.

1356
01:37:40,942 --> 01:37:42,273
Merry Christmas.

1357
01:37:43,945 --> 01:37:45,776
And? And?

1358
01:37:46,114 --> 01:37:47,672
Happy Hanukkah.

1359
01:37:48,516 --> 01:37:51,610
- Very funny.
- Go get yourself something nice.

1360
01:38:00,028 --> 01:38:04,795
Lufthansa should have been our ultimate
score. The heist of a lifetime.

1361
01:38:05,133 --> 01:38:08,967
Six million in cash.
More than enough to go around.

1362
01:38:18,146 --> 01:38:19,704
Yo, Stacks!

1363
01:38:20,048 --> 01:38:21,413
Open up!

1364
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:32,653
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1365
01:38:36,164 --> 01:38:38,826
Frankie will make coffee. Make coffee.

1366
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:44,501
Thought you'd have a bitch in here.

1367
01:38:44,739 --> 01:38:47,173
I did. Where the fuck is she?

1368
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:56,582
- 11:30. We were to be there by 9.
- I'll be ready in a minute.

1369
01:38:56,851 --> 01:39:00,446
You're always late. You'd be
late for your own funeral.

1370
01:39:05,593 --> 01:39:09,427
What are you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1371
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:17,364
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.
A joke. Put the fucking pot down.

1372
01:39:37,225 --> 01:39:39,455
Stacks was always crazy.

1373
01:39:39,794 --> 01:39:43,286
Instead of getting rid of the truck as
he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1374
01:39:43,565 --> 01:39:47,968
...went to his girlfriend's, and when he
woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1375
01:39:48,236 --> 01:39:50,295
It was all over the television.

1376
01:39:50,572 --> 01:39:53,473
They even said they got
prints off the wheel.

1377
01:39:54,309 --> 01:39:57,608
It was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.

1378
01:40:09,424 --> 01:40:11,187
I got to talk to you.

1379
01:40:11,626 --> 01:40:14,356
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink. Come on.

1380
01:40:14,629 --> 01:40:18,690
Have a drink. What are you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1381
01:40:19,968 --> 01:40:21,629
I still have to talk to you.

1382
01:40:23,204 --> 01:40:25,798
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.

1383
01:40:33,448 --> 01:40:35,143
What are you worried about?

1384
01:40:35,383 --> 01:40:38,875
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1385
01:40:39,053 --> 01:40:42,386
- What are you worried about?
- You worry too much.

1386
01:40:42,724 --> 01:40:45,989
Everything is beautiful.
Didn't you tell him?

1387
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,559
Not yet.

1388
01:40:48,062 --> 01:40:49,222
Guess what.

1389
01:40:50,732 --> 01:40:52,063
They are going to make him.

1390
01:40:54,002 --> 01:40:56,163
Paulie's going to make you?

1391
01:40:57,839 --> 01:41:00,672
They opened the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1392
01:41:00,842 --> 01:41:03,470
Can you believe that?
This guinea bastard.

1393
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:08,415
He's getting made. We'll work for
this guy one day. He'll be a boss.

1394
01:41:10,018 --> 01:41:11,417
I can't believe him.

1395
01:41:11,686 --> 01:41:14,018
I'm happy for you. Congratulations.

1396
01:41:14,188 --> 01:41:16,019
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1397
01:41:16,691 --> 01:41:18,852
I've been looking all over for you.

1398
01:41:19,193 --> 01:41:20,922
Can I talk to you a second?

1399
01:41:21,195 --> 01:41:24,096
I masterminded the whole
thing, I'm left with dick.

1400
01:41:24,365 --> 01:41:27,926
They be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

1401
01:41:28,202 --> 01:41:32,764
I want my money.
I've had it up to here.

1402
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:36,204
- Fuck him! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.

1403
01:41:38,513 --> 01:41:40,777
Now will you keep you mouth shut?

1404
01:41:42,884 --> 01:41:47,446
Morrie, you'll get your money.
You just got to stop busting balls.

1405
01:41:47,722 --> 01:41:49,383
All right. You hear me?

1406
01:41:49,524 --> 01:41:52,721
Everything's going to be fine.

1407
01:42:01,302 --> 01:42:05,432
Oh, Henry boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling

1408
01:42:05,973 --> 01:42:09,238
Half mick, half guinea.
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1409
01:42:09,444 --> 01:42:13,312
And down the glen, the glen,
and down the mountainside.

1410
01:42:22,423 --> 01:42:24,084
The summer's gone.

1411
01:42:24,425 --> 01:42:26,450
And all the roses dying

1412
01:42:51,452 --> 01:42:54,683
I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1413
01:42:54,956 --> 01:42:58,448
His mind was going in eight
different directions at once.

1414
01:43:00,495 --> 01:43:02,588
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1415
01:43:03,364 --> 01:43:04,956
Morrie? Him?

1416
01:43:05,299 --> 01:43:08,029
That's when I knew Jimmy
was going to whack Morrie.

1417
01:43:08,302 --> 01:43:12,966
That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1418
01:43:13,207 --> 01:43:15,505
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1419
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:19,211
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1420
01:43:19,447 --> 01:43:22,610
Nobody cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1421
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:24,881
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1422
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,381
- Okay?
- All right.

1423
01:43:29,791 --> 01:43:32,692
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1424
01:43:32,894 --> 01:43:34,725
Stop breaking my balls.

1425
01:43:34,996 --> 01:43:37,226
I was just stalling for time.

1426
01:43:37,632 --> 01:43:41,534
I knew I had 'til 8 or 9 to talk
Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1427
01:43:41,836 --> 01:43:46,170
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.

1428
01:43:46,407 --> 01:43:50,468
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out cold.

1429
01:43:51,312 --> 01:43:54,338
I'm enraged. I wanted to
kill this little fuck.

1430
01:43:54,549 --> 01:43:57,245
We start to go in this joint.

1431
01:43:57,485 --> 01:44:01,080
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's doing this to me.

1432
01:44:01,556 --> 01:44:03,251
I don't want to turn around.

1433
01:44:03,491 --> 01:44:07,552
I don't want to turn around. He picks
up his fucking head, he says, "Ah..."

1434
01:44:08,496 --> 01:44:10,430
I said, "Don't say it!"

1435
01:44:15,102 --> 01:44:16,262
"Jerkoff!"

1436
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,271
What are you going to do? What?
I fly at him.

1437
01:44:22,510 --> 01:44:25,775
I got him and I'm banging
his head, banging his face.

1438
01:44:26,047 --> 01:44:30,780
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I bit him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1439
01:44:31,052 --> 01:44:33,782
He's laying there full of blood.
I'm out of breath.

1440
01:44:34,055 --> 01:44:36,455
Forget about tonight. Forget it.

1441
01:44:37,592 --> 01:44:40,117
It was a load off my mind.

1442
01:44:40,795 --> 01:44:43,958
He never knew how close he'd
come to getting killed.

1443
01:44:44,131 --> 01:44:46,895
Even if I told him he would
never have believed me.

1444
01:44:49,237 --> 01:44:53,606
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1445
01:44:53,908 --> 01:44:56,399
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.

1446
01:44:56,611 --> 01:44:59,239
I've never met a ball buster like you.

1447
01:44:59,547 --> 01:45:02,141
Who loves you more than I do?

1448
01:45:02,416 --> 01:45:05,908
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except stop busting my balls.

1449
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:08,987
- Let's go have coffee.
- Want to go to the diner?

1450
01:45:09,257 --> 01:45:11,316
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1451
01:45:11,559 --> 01:45:15,256
- Which diner?
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1452
01:45:15,463 --> 01:45:17,158
- They got danish?
- They got everything.

1453
01:45:17,331 --> 01:45:19,993
Let's pick up danish for Belle.

1454
01:45:20,568 --> 01:45:25,005
Hear about the points we were shaving
in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...

1455
01:45:32,947 --> 01:45:34,574
I thought he'd never shut up.

1456
01:45:34,849 --> 01:45:36,339
What a pain in the ass.

1457
01:45:36,584 --> 01:45:39,109
- What'll we do with him?
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1458
01:45:39,353 --> 01:45:40,752
Call me when you're through.

1459
01:45:44,292 --> 01:45:47,659
- Where you going, dizzy motherfucker?
- You said chop him up.

1460
01:45:48,229 --> 01:45:50,493
At Charlie's. Where will we do it here?

1461
01:45:52,433 --> 01:45:54,867
Come on. Get out of here.

1462
01:45:55,202 --> 01:45:57,602
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1463
01:45:57,972 --> 01:45:59,200
The car's cold.

1464
01:45:59,373 --> 01:46:02,672
Get out of here! What, warm it up?
Get out of here!

1465
01:46:03,878 --> 01:46:06,369
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.

1466
01:46:06,614 --> 01:46:08,775
It's Belle. Let me in.

1467
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:12,679
Morris didn't come home.
He's missing I know something happened.

1468
01:46:12,987 --> 01:46:14,318
Calm down.

1469
01:46:14,522 --> 01:46:17,218
He's missing!
I know something happened.

1470
01:46:17,391 --> 01:46:19,450
He probably fell asleep somewhere.

1471
01:46:19,694 --> 01:46:23,323
In 27 years he's never been
away all night without calling.

1472
01:46:23,531 --> 01:46:25,999
Something's happened. I know you know.

1473
01:46:26,233 --> 01:46:29,464
Let me get changed. I'll take
you home then look for him.

1474
01:46:29,704 --> 01:46:32,400
I've been home!
I've been on the phone...

1475
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:33,902
He's playing cards.

1476
01:46:36,644 --> 01:46:39,477
- What'll I tell Belle?
- Who gives a fuck?

1477
01:46:43,918 --> 01:46:46,011
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with me.

1478
01:46:46,253 --> 01:46:47,914
I bust their balls all the time.

1479
01:46:48,189 --> 01:46:50,817
Don't give them the
satisfaction, those fucks.

1480
01:46:53,494 --> 01:46:55,724
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1481
01:46:57,264 --> 01:46:58,731
Keep them up all night,

1482
01:46:59,734 --> 01:47:01,258
I'll see you later.

1483
01:47:51,085 --> 01:47:54,248
Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...

1484
01:48:07,435 --> 01:48:10,836
I gave Jimmy the tip and he
gave me some Christmas money.

1485
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,567
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1486
01:48:15,042 --> 01:48:18,500
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.
It was his.

1487
01:48:19,046 --> 01:48:21,844
He kicked some money upstairs
to Paulie, but that was it.

1488
01:48:23,451 --> 01:48:26,750
It made him sick to turn money
over to the guys who stole it.

1489
01:48:27,054 --> 01:48:29,852
He'd rather whack them.
What did I care?

1490
01:48:30,191 --> 01:48:32,284
I wasn't asking for anything.

1491
01:48:32,526 --> 01:48:35,757
And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1492
01:48:36,063 --> 01:48:40,523
Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1493
01:49:02,423 --> 01:49:06,450
When they found Carbone in the meat
truck he was frozen so stiff...

1494
01:49:06,694 --> 01:49:10,323
...it took them 2 days to
thaw him out for the autopsy.

1495
01:49:14,969 --> 01:49:17,335
I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1496
01:49:17,571 --> 01:49:20,904
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through Pittsburgh...

1497
01:49:21,108 --> 01:49:24,635
...and even after a while the
Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1498
01:49:24,979 --> 01:49:27,106
Jimmy was so happy that morning...

1499
01:49:30,651 --> 01:49:34,109
Jimmy was so excited you'd
think he was being made.

1500
01:49:34,355 --> 01:49:37,119
He must have made four
calls to Tommy's house.

1501
01:49:41,996 --> 01:49:44,191
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.

1502
01:49:44,732 --> 01:49:47,667
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.

1503
01:49:47,935 --> 01:49:50,130
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?

1504
01:49:54,608 --> 01:49:57,736
I love you. Don't paint
any religious pictures.

1505
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:02,144
We always called each other good fellas.

1506
01:50:02,383 --> 01:50:04,010
You'd say to somebody:

1507
01:50:04,285 --> 01:50:08,449
"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a good fella, one of us."

1508
01:50:08,756 --> 01:50:10,155
Understand?

1509
01:50:10,758 --> 01:50:12,953
We were good fellas. Wiseguys.

1510
01:50:15,629 --> 01:50:18,757
Jimmy and me could never be made
because we had Irish blood.

1511
01:50:19,033 --> 01:50:21,524
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1512
01:50:21,769 --> 01:50:25,705
To become a member of a crew
you must be 100% Italian...

1513
01:50:25,973 --> 01:50:28,874
...so they can trace your
relatives to the old country.

1514
01:50:35,783 --> 01:50:38,479
It's the highest honor
they can give you.

1515
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:41,313
It means you belong to
a family and a crew.

1516
01:50:41,555 --> 01:50:44,422
It means nobody can
fuck around with you.

1517
01:50:44,725 --> 01:50:49,560
Also, you can fuck around with anybody,
as long as they aren't also a member.

1518
01:50:49,897 --> 01:50:53,492
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.

1519
01:50:55,703 --> 01:50:56,931
How many years since you was made?

1520
01:50:57,004 --> 01:50:59,564
I'm an old-timer. Thirty years ago.

1521
01:51:00,341 --> 01:51:05,005
Bring back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1522
01:51:11,285 --> 01:51:13,344
...it was like we were all being made.

1523
01:51:14,455 --> 01:51:17,219
We would now have
one of our own as a member.

1524
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:37,438
Who's this? Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1525
01:51:37,711 --> 01:51:41,306
We had a problem. We tried to do
everything we could.

1526
01:51:42,049 --> 01:51:46,110
You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1527
01:51:48,555 --> 01:51:49,852
What do you mean?

1528
01:51:50,124 --> 01:51:51,853
He's gone. He's gone.

1529
01:51:53,394 --> 01:51:54,452
That's it.

1530
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:00,560
I knew it!

1531
01:52:31,899 --> 01:52:33,093
Are you all right?

1532
01:52:40,674 --> 01:52:45,111
It was revenge for Billy Batts,
and a lot of other things.

1533
01:52:45,379 --> 01:52:46,175
That's that.

1534
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,610
There was nothing we could do about it.

1535
01:52:49,316 --> 01:52:54,117
Batts was a made man; Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.

1536
01:52:54,455 --> 01:52:57,686
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.

1537
01:53:10,537 --> 01:53:12,698
They even shot Tommy in the face...

1538
01:54:03,490 --> 01:54:06,459
I had a busy day. I had to
drop guns off at Jimmy's...

1539
01:54:06,693 --> 01:54:08,593
...to match some silencers he had.

1540
01:54:08,862 --> 01:54:11,922
I had to pick up my
brother at the hospital...

1541
01:54:12,199 --> 01:54:14,429
...and pick up some stuff for Lois...

1542
01:54:14,701 --> 01:54:17,602
...to fly down to some
customers in Atlanta.

1543
01:54:29,216 --> 01:54:32,708
Right away I knew he didn't want
them and I'd be stuck for the money.

1544
01:54:32,886 --> 01:54:37,016
I bought them because he wanted
them and now he didn't want them.

1545
01:54:37,291 --> 01:54:39,953
What good are these? None of them fit.

1546
01:54:42,529 --> 01:54:46,124
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed he didn't say good-bye.

1547
01:54:46,433 --> 01:54:48,901
The drugs are making
your mind into mush.

1548
01:55:05,919 --> 01:55:09,446
Since I would see them in the
afternoon, I was pretty sure...

1549
01:55:09,656 --> 01:55:12,056
...I'd get my money back.

1550
01:55:31,044 --> 01:55:32,272
Oh, my God.

1551
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:38,017
At the hospital, Michael's
doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1552
01:55:38,352 --> 01:55:39,785
What happened to you?

1553
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:46,787
And I told him I was partying all night.

1554
01:55:48,095 --> 01:55:49,687
Get over here.

1555
01:55:49,863 --> 01:55:52,354
Let me check you out.

1556
01:55:55,702 --> 01:55:58,034
He took mercy on me, gave me Valium...

1557
01:55:58,305 --> 01:56:00,205
...and sent me home.

1558
01:56:00,374 --> 01:56:04,367
My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.

1559
01:56:06,046 --> 01:56:09,482
There it is. You see that
helicopter right there?

1560
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:12,985
Right up there. It's been
following me all morning.

1561
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:15,882
- Are you nuts?
- I'm telling you.

1562
01:56:16,223 --> 01:56:19,624
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital.

1563
01:56:19,893 --> 01:56:22,054
I had to make some stops.

1564
01:56:22,329 --> 01:56:25,389
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1565
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:34,539
I was cooking dinner.

1566
01:56:34,675 --> 01:56:39,112
I had to start braising the beef and
veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1567
01:56:41,782 --> 01:56:44,945
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with gravy...

1568
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:46,949
...roasted peppers...

1569
01:56:47,187 --> 01:56:51,055
...string beans with olive oil,
and beautiful cutlets...

1570
01:56:51,191 --> 01:56:52,886
...that were cut just right...

1571
01:56:56,396 --> 01:56:58,057
So I was home for about an hour.

1572
01:56:58,565 --> 01:57:02,968
My plan was to start dinner early so I
could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.

1573
01:57:03,203 --> 01:57:07,572
Then get the package for Lois to
take to Atlanta later that night.

1574
01:57:08,575 --> 01:57:12,204
I kept looking out the window and
saw that the helicopter was gone.

1575
01:57:12,646 --> 01:57:14,409
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.

1576
01:57:14,581 --> 01:57:17,072
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1577
01:57:17,317 --> 01:57:21,720
I asked my brother to watch the
sauce and Karen and I started out.

1578
01:57:23,824 --> 01:57:26,156
Oh, God. I see it.

1579
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:28,155
It's right there.

1580
01:57:30,163 --> 01:57:31,221
That's it.

1581
01:57:31,431 --> 01:57:33,592
We got to get to your mother's.

1582
01:57:33,934 --> 01:57:35,094
I told you.

1583
01:57:35,235 --> 01:57:36,930
It's funny.

1584
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:39,468
- It's not the end of the world.
- Let's get to your mother's.

1585
01:58:08,702 --> 01:58:12,194
Tell your mother not to touch anything
outside of the house. Nothing.

1586
01:58:20,647 --> 01:58:21,773
Let's go shopping.

1587
01:58:25,252 --> 01:58:29,086
It's been following me all morning

1588
01:58:32,292 --> 01:58:34,055
He thinks I'm paranoid.

1589
01:58:34,394 --> 01:58:38,455
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1590
01:58:45,672 --> 01:58:47,003
It's gone.

1591
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,299
- I don't hear it.
- Let's go back to your mother's.

1592
01:59:05,826 --> 01:59:09,262
Didn't I say you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1593
01:59:09,496 --> 01:59:11,191
Yeah. I need a hit.

1594
01:59:11,498 --> 01:59:14,331
Want to see helicopters?
I'll show you helicopters.

1595
01:59:14,768 --> 01:59:17,828
I've seen enough helicopters
for one day, thank you.

1596
01:59:18,572 --> 01:59:22,941
I had to get home and get the package
ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1597
01:59:23,210 --> 01:59:27,112
I also had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.

1598
01:59:27,347 --> 01:59:29,577
And I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1599
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:33,342
I had cooking to finish, and I had
to get Lois ready for her trip.

1600
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:36,853
- It's Sandy. What the fuck is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.

1601
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:42,954
- You staying tonight?
- I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1602
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:47,860
Come on, stop. Stop. We'll talk
about it later, okay? Good-bye.

1603
01:59:55,442 --> 01:59:57,307
It's me. You ready?

1604
01:59:57,978 --> 02:00:00,310
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.

1605
02:00:01,248 --> 02:00:04,615
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.

1606
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:09,618
Don't "yeah, yeah" me.
This is important.

1607
02:00:09,823 --> 02:00:12,451
Leave the house when you make the call.

1608
02:00:12,626 --> 02:00:15,459
Understand me?
Call from an outside line.

1609
02:00:15,629 --> 02:00:19,326
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb.
I know what to do.

1610
02:00:19,633 --> 02:00:21,999
You hick, just make sure you do it.

1611
02:00:22,169 --> 02:00:23,261
You're a pain.

1612
02:00:23,403 --> 02:00:26,338
Hey! Just do it!

1613
02:00:28,108 --> 02:00:32,636
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1614
02:00:33,914 --> 02:00:36,109
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.

1615
02:00:36,349 --> 02:00:38,408
What does she do after she hangs up?

1616
02:00:38,652 --> 02:00:42,486
After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?

1617
02:00:42,789 --> 02:00:47,488
She calls from the house. If anyone
was listening they'd know everything.

1618
02:00:47,794 --> 02:00:52,595
They'd know a package was leaving my
house and they'd have the flight number.

1619
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:56,364
I got home and started cooking.

1620
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:59,036
I had a few hours before Lois' flight.

1621
02:00:59,306 --> 02:01:01,297
I told my brother to watch the stove.

1622
02:01:01,508 --> 02:01:05,376
All day long the poor guy's been
watching helicopters and tomato sauce.

1623
02:01:06,146 --> 02:01:10,606
I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix
the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1624
02:01:21,962 --> 02:01:24,829
Do you think you can come
over, fuck me, then leave?

1625
02:01:30,237 --> 02:01:32,068
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1626
02:01:32,339 --> 02:01:33,431
You believe me?

1627
02:01:35,075 --> 02:01:37,339
Do you believe me?

1628
02:01:39,713 --> 02:01:41,078
That the last one?

1629
02:01:50,724 --> 02:01:52,988
You lying son-of-a-bitch! I hate you!

1630
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,101
Please stop feeding the
dog from the table...

1631
02:02:03,370 --> 02:02:06,430
...from the plate on
top of it. Stop it.

1632
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:09,573
- I have to.
- You don't have to.

1633
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:14,938
I got to go home.

1634
02:02:17,384 --> 02:02:19,113
What do you mean?

1635
02:02:19,386 --> 02:02:23,288
We got to tape this stuff to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1636
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:25,751
I got to go home and get my hat.

1637
02:02:26,426 --> 02:02:29,122
Forget your hat. Are you kidding me?

1638
02:02:29,396 --> 02:02:32,456
I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?!

1639
02:02:32,766 --> 02:02:36,293
I got to have it. It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.

1640
02:02:38,038 --> 02:02:40,598
Do you understand what
we are involved in?

1641
02:02:40,907 --> 02:02:44,138
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1642
02:02:49,049 --> 02:02:52,917
What could I do if she insisted I
drive her home for her damn hat?

1643
02:02:53,153 --> 02:02:55,781
I hid the package and
went to take her home.

1644
02:03:05,932 --> 02:03:07,263
What the fuck is this?

1645
02:03:07,534 --> 02:03:10,059
Police! Don't move, motherfucker.

1646
02:03:10,337 --> 02:03:12,999
I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off.

1647
02:03:17,277 --> 02:03:21,941
I thought I was dead, but when I
heard the noise I knew they were cops.

1648
02:03:22,182 --> 02:03:23,809
Only cops talk that way.

1649
02:03:24,084 --> 02:03:25,449
Don't fucking move.

1650
02:03:25,552 --> 02:03:29,454
If they had been wiseguys, I
wouldn't have heard a thing.

1651
02:03:29,656 --> 02:03:31,351
I would have been dead.

1652
02:03:58,051 --> 02:04:02,920
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar? I'm talking to you.

1653
02:04:03,156 --> 02:04:06,683
You don't want to talk, don't talk.
I don't give a fuck.

1654
02:04:11,231 --> 02:04:14,166
All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...

1655
02:04:14,334 --> 02:04:18,168
...were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1656
02:04:18,338 --> 02:04:19,464
Get the lawyer.

1657
02:04:19,706 --> 02:04:22,937
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance.

1658
02:04:23,076 --> 02:04:25,636
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.

1659
02:04:25,945 --> 02:04:29,437
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

1660
02:04:33,953 --> 02:04:38,083
25 fucking years, pal. I'll slap
your fucking head inside out.

1661
02:04:39,359 --> 02:04:41,725
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1662
02:04:42,729 --> 02:04:46,460
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1663
02:04:46,733 --> 02:04:48,963
You got anything good in there?

1664
02:04:50,570 --> 02:04:52,094
Is it good?

1665
02:04:56,843 --> 02:04:59,038
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1666
02:05:01,514 --> 02:05:03,209
See you in Attica.

1667
02:05:03,683 --> 02:05:07,278
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1668
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:10,580
He wants to talk to you,
to know what's happening.

1669
02:05:10,857 --> 02:05:12,381
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1670
02:05:12,592 --> 02:05:16,221
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1671
02:05:16,529 --> 02:05:18,463
Then you're safer in here.

1672
02:05:18,698 --> 02:05:23,533
They could whack me here as easy as out-
side. They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1673
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:27,536
People are already walking away from me.
You got to get me out.

1674
02:05:28,475 --> 02:05:32,605
Karen finally got her mother to put
up her house for bail and I was out.

1675
02:05:32,879 --> 02:05:37,248
I had this feeling I would be
killed right outside the jail.

1676
02:05:37,484 --> 02:05:40,715
I knew Paulie was pissed at
me and he's such a hothead.

1677
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:42,612
And I was worried about Jimmy.

1678
02:05:42,889 --> 02:05:47,485
Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he
was in the drug deals with me...

1679
02:05:47,794 --> 02:05:51,321
...Paulie would have Jimmy
whacked even before me.

1680
02:05:52,432 --> 02:05:54,491
This is the bad time.

1681
02:05:55,268 --> 02:05:57,896
I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1682
02:05:59,172 --> 02:06:03,040
Now my plan was to stay alive long
enough to sell off the dope...

1683
02:06:03,276 --> 02:06:07,736
...the cops never found, then disappear
until things got straightened out.

1684
02:06:09,582 --> 02:06:12,278
Fuck! Where's the stuff I left, Karen?

1685
02:06:12,519 --> 02:06:14,350
I flushed it down the toilet.

1686
02:06:15,755 --> 02:06:16,722
What?!

1687
02:06:17,757 --> 02:06:20,351
What was I supposed to do?!

1688
02:06:20,426 --> 02:06:24,260
That was worth $60,000! I need
that money! That's all we got!

1689
02:06:24,731 --> 02:06:27,291
They had a search warrant!

1690
02:06:27,534 --> 02:06:32,062
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?!

1691
02:06:32,305 --> 02:06:34,933
I had to! They were going to find it!

1692
02:06:35,208 --> 02:06:39,770
- They wouldn't have found it!
- They would have! I swear!

1693
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:42,547
They would've found it!

1694
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:45,317
Why did you do that?!

1695
02:06:45,852 --> 02:06:49,310
- They would have found it.
- Why did you do that?

1696
02:06:50,557 --> 02:06:52,388
Oh, my God!

1697
02:06:52,625 --> 02:06:54,217
I had to do it.

1698
02:07:31,598 --> 02:07:34,123
Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1699
02:07:36,269 --> 02:07:39,432
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1700
02:07:39,672 --> 02:07:41,196
Yeah, you fucked up.

1701
02:07:44,677 --> 02:07:47,009
But I'm all right now.

1702
02:07:48,281 --> 02:07:52,445
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1703
02:07:52,619 --> 02:07:54,746
You looked me in the
eyes and lied to me.

1704
02:07:56,155 --> 02:08:00,216
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.

1705
02:08:00,426 --> 02:08:03,293
After what you said, I
couldn't come to you.

1706
02:08:04,530 --> 02:08:06,930
You know, I was ashamed.

1707
02:08:15,241 --> 02:08:17,709
But I got nowhere else to go.

1708
02:08:20,713 --> 02:08:25,412
You're all I got. And I really,
really need your help. I really do.

1709
02:08:31,057 --> 02:08:31,716
Take this.

1710
02:08:47,273 --> 02:08:49,332
And now I must turn my back on you.

1711
02:08:59,819 --> 02:09:01,480
Thirty-two hundred bucks.

1712
02:09:01,988 --> 02:09:06,220
That's what he gave me.
3,200 bucks for a lifetime.

1713
02:09:06,759 --> 02:09:09,284
It wasn't even enough to buy a coffin.

1714
02:09:09,495 --> 02:09:11,827
- We got to get out.
- I don't want to run.

1715
02:09:11,998 --> 02:09:16,094
Am I supposed to pick up and
leave everything? Go hiding?

1716
02:09:16,369 --> 02:09:18,599
I don't want to do that.

1717
02:09:18,838 --> 02:09:23,707
If we stay around here we're dead.
You got it? We' re dead.

1718
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:29,243
They're right. You took too much of
that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

1719
02:09:32,618 --> 02:09:34,449
How's he doing?

1720
02:09:34,721 --> 02:09:36,018
He's okay.

1721
02:09:36,622 --> 02:09:38,317
They sobered him up.

1722
02:09:38,524 --> 02:09:40,617
Good. Glad to hear it.

1723
02:09:44,797 --> 02:09:48,028
- What kind of questions they been asking?
- I don't know.

1724
02:09:49,736 --> 02:09:53,638
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...

1725
02:09:53,873 --> 02:09:56,467
...the girls are old
enough to read newspapers.

1726
02:09:56,743 --> 02:09:58,643
Tell him to call me.

1727
02:09:59,479 --> 02:10:03,279
As soon as you talk to him tell
him to call me. It's important.

1728
02:10:03,483 --> 02:10:06,975
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1729
02:10:07,286 --> 02:10:09,413
Take this. It's a couple thousand.

1730
02:10:10,490 --> 02:10:12,754
Everything will be all right.

1731
02:10:12,892 --> 02:10:15,827
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.

1732
02:10:16,162 --> 02:10:18,062
Take some for yourself.

1733
02:10:21,167 --> 02:10:23,567
Not here. In the store on the corner.

1734
02:10:23,836 --> 02:10:25,997
It's swag, so I got it down the corner.

1735
02:10:32,311 --> 02:10:34,006
I'll see you.

1736
02:10:34,313 --> 02:10:35,837
- Thanks.
- Don't worry.

1737
02:10:36,082 --> 02:10:38,915
- I'll try.
- He's got to call me.

1738
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:42,378
Over here?

1739
02:10:42,588 --> 02:10:43,850
Down here.

1740
02:10:58,604 --> 02:11:00,333
It's right there.

1741
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:01,929
Right there.

1742
02:11:35,908 --> 02:11:38,376
Go ahead! It's right there.

1743
02:11:38,644 --> 02:11:40,839
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry.

1744
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:43,913
My mom's watching the kids.
I got to get home.

1745
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:45,913
I'll come back later.

1746
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:15,613
What happened?

1747
02:12:16,449 --> 02:12:17,780
Nothing.

1748
02:12:18,117 --> 02:12:20,779
- What happened?
- I just got scared.

1749
02:12:23,523 --> 02:12:25,013
Got the keys?

1750
02:12:26,359 --> 02:12:27,519
What happened?

1751
02:12:27,793 --> 02:12:30,125
I just got scared. It's okay.

1752
02:12:30,296 --> 02:12:31,456
You all right?

1753
02:12:38,704 --> 02:12:42,800
If you're part of a crew nobody
tells you they're going to kill you.

1754
02:12:43,709 --> 02:12:45,540
It doesn't happen that way.

1755
02:12:45,811 --> 02:12:49,144
There aren't any arguments or
curses like in the movies.

1756
02:12:53,653 --> 02:12:55,712
People who cared for you all your life.

1757
02:12:55,888 --> 02:13:00,552
They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

1758
02:13:00,826 --> 02:13:03,886
So I met Jimmy in a
crowded place we both knew.

1759
02:13:04,163 --> 02:13:08,224
I got there 15 minutes early
and Jimmy was already there.

1760
02:13:08,568 --> 02:13:13,232
He took a booth near the window so
he could see everyone who drove up.

1761
02:13:13,506 --> 02:13:15,940
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1762
02:13:20,046 --> 02:13:23,106
On the surface, everything
was supposed to be fine.

1763
02:13:23,382 --> 02:13:25,612
We were supposed to discuss my case.

1764
02:13:25,885 --> 02:13:30,720
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to
sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1765
02:13:32,291 --> 02:13:35,954
I been telling you your whole
life, don't talk on the phone.

1766
02:13:36,229 --> 02:13:37,787
Now you understand?

1767
02:13:40,566 --> 02:13:43,967
It'll be all right. You got a
good chance to beat this case.

1768
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:51,574
Well, you know that kid from the city
we're talking about? You know?

1769
02:13:54,146 --> 02:13:58,640
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon
as he got pinched he ratted on everybody.

1770
02:14:00,753 --> 02:14:03,586
I know where he is. He's hiding out.

1771
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:05,648
Know what I'm saying?

1772
02:14:10,997 --> 02:14:14,592
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1773
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:18,931
No, not at all.

1774
02:14:20,172 --> 02:14:21,764
That way they got nothing.

1775
02:14:33,953 --> 02:14:38,117
But now he's asking me to go to
Florida and do a hit with Anthony.

1776
02:14:45,031 --> 02:14:49,127
That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.

1777
02:15:02,214 --> 02:15:05,650
Wherever you move me, I asked
once and I tell you again...

1778
02:15:05,885 --> 02:15:08,149
...I don't want to go any place cold.

1779
02:15:09,055 --> 02:15:10,886
You don't have a choice.

1780
02:15:11,657 --> 02:15:14,717
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1781
02:15:14,994 --> 02:15:17,462
...just no place cold. Do that for me.

1782
02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:19,823
He's bronchial, that's why.

1783
02:15:20,066 --> 02:15:22,534
If he's bronchial we'll consider that.

1784
02:15:22,735 --> 02:15:24,464
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1785
02:15:24,737 --> 02:15:29,174
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1786
02:15:29,709 --> 02:15:30,676
What about them?

1787
02:15:30,910 --> 02:15:34,346
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1788
02:15:34,547 --> 02:15:36,913
Will I have some contact with them?

1789
02:15:37,550 --> 02:15:38,517
No.

1790
02:15:39,752 --> 02:15:43,244
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...

1791
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:53,692
If there's extraordinary circumstances...

1792
02:15:57,503 --> 02:15:59,698
I can't leave my parents.

1793
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:03,272
Karen, I told you before.

1794
02:16:03,943 --> 02:16:07,379
I'm not going to do this unless
you and the kids come with me.

1795
02:16:09,215 --> 02:16:11,274
I can't do it without you.

1796
02:16:11,517 --> 02:16:15,112
So you do whatever, but... that's it.

1797
02:16:16,956 --> 02:16:19,584
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

1798
02:16:19,892 --> 02:16:22,053
I don't care whether you go or not.

1799
02:16:22,595 --> 02:16:26,053
If it'll make him a better
witness, I want you with him.

1800
02:16:26,298 --> 02:16:27,788
They don't want me.

1801
02:16:27,967 --> 02:16:31,596
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

1802
02:16:31,971 --> 02:16:35,304
They can only get to him by
getting to you or your kids.

1803
02:16:35,441 --> 02:16:38,069
If he goes into the
program you're in danger.

1804
02:16:38,310 --> 02:16:40,437
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...

1805
02:16:40,746 --> 02:16:42,213
...the babes-in-the-wood routine.

1806
02:16:42,415 --> 02:16:46,749
I've listened to those wiretaps and
I've heard you talk about cocaine.

1807
02:16:46,986 --> 02:16:50,922
Conversation after conversation
you talk to Henry on the phone.

1808
02:16:55,461 --> 02:16:58,259
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

1809
02:16:58,431 --> 02:17:01,161
...or stays on the streets,
he's a dead man.

1810
02:17:01,767 --> 02:17:03,462
He knows it and you know it.

1811
02:17:05,004 --> 02:17:07,564
What about the kids and school?

1812
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,330
I mean, what goes on?

1813
02:17:10,176 --> 02:17:12,110
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

1814
02:17:12,344 --> 02:17:14,642
Whoever sold you those
suits had a sense of humor.

1815
02:17:14,847 --> 02:17:18,442
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

1816
02:17:18,651 --> 02:17:22,485
We'll save your life, his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

1817
02:17:25,791 --> 02:17:28,658
This morning you told the
jury about your background.

1818
02:17:28,961 --> 02:17:31,361
It was easy for us to disappear.

1819
02:17:31,597 --> 02:17:35,966
My house was in my mother-in-law's
name. My cars were registered to my wife.

1820
02:17:36,135 --> 02:17:39,502
My Social Security cards and
driver's licenses were phonies.

1821
02:17:39,805 --> 02:17:42,273
I never voted or paid taxes.

1822
02:17:42,508 --> 02:17:46,968
My birth certificate and arrest sheet
were all that showed I was alive.

1823
02:17:47,146 --> 02:17:49,307
Do you see him here in this courtroom?

1824
02:17:50,149 --> 02:17:53,050
Will you point him out for the jury?

1825
02:17:55,154 --> 02:17:59,989
Let the record show that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant James Conway.

1826
02:18:01,393 --> 02:18:03,884
Do you also know a
man named Paul Cicero?

1827
02:18:04,163 --> 02:18:06,461
Do you see him in the courtroom?

1828
02:18:06,699 --> 02:18:09,190
Can you point him out for the jury?

1829
02:18:10,069 --> 02:18:15,006
Let the record show Mr. Hill
identified the defendant Paul Cicero.

1830
02:18:16,175 --> 02:18:17,836
I have a document...

1831
02:18:18,077 --> 02:18:21,171
The hardest thing was to leave the life.

1832
02:18:21,413 --> 02:18:23,005
I love the life.

1833
02:18:23,249 --> 02:18:27,481
We were treated like movie stars
with muscle. We had it all.

1834
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:31,087
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

1835
02:18:31,357 --> 02:18:34,554
I had bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

1836
02:18:34,860 --> 02:18:36,919
I had a bowl of coke next to the bed.

1837
02:18:37,096 --> 02:18:40,930
People call them rats because
they will do anything to survive.

1838
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:42,863
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

1839
02:18:43,102 --> 02:18:47,038
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it!

1840
02:18:48,741 --> 02:18:51,039
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

1841
02:18:51,277 --> 02:18:54,678
Free cars. Keys to a dozen
hideouts all over the city.

1842
02:18:54,947 --> 02:18:57,507
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend...

1843
02:18:57,683 --> 02:19:01,744
...then blow the winnings in a week
or go to sharks to pay the bookies.

1844
02:19:02,054 --> 02:19:03,453
Didn't matter.

1845
02:19:03,756 --> 02:19:08,591
It didn't mean anything. When I
was broke I would go rob some more.

1846
02:19:08,961 --> 02:19:10,758
We ran everything.

1847
02:19:11,063 --> 02:19:15,227
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

1848
02:19:15,434 --> 02:19:19,530
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

1849
02:19:20,973 --> 02:19:22,634
And now it's all over.

1850
02:19:23,309 --> 02:19:25,402
That's the hardest part.

1851
02:19:26,145 --> 02:19:27,908
Today everything is different.

1852
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:32,244
There's no action. I have to
wait around like everyone else.

1853
02:19:32,451 --> 02:19:34,544
Can't even get decent food.

1854
02:19:34,787 --> 02:19:38,086
After I got here I ordered
spaghetti with marinara sauce...

1855
02:19:38,324 --> 02:19:40,417
...and I got egg noodles with ketchup.

1856
02:19:40,726 --> 02:19:42,785
I'm an average nobody.
