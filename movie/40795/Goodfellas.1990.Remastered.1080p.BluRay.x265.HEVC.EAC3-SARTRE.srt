纽约 1970年

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,940
什么声音 What the fuck is that?

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,800
吉米 Jimmy?

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,870
- 什么事 - 我是不是撞到什么了 - What's up? - Did I hit something?

14
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,710
到底是什么 What the fuck is that?

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,380
是不是爆胎啦 Maybe you got a flat?

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,140
不是啦 No.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,090
他妈的 最好停下来看看 What the fuck? You better pull over and see.

18
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,480
他还活着 你他妈的真是人渣 He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!

19
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,490
去死吧 婊子养的 看着我 Die you motherfucker! Look at me!

20
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,930
从我有记忆开始 我就想成为黑帮分子 As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,800
对我来说 To me

28
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,100
成为黑帮分子比当选美国总统还好 being a gangster was better than being president of the United States.

29
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,680
纽约东区 布鲁克林 1955年

30
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,180
在我去计程车站找零工之前 Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an after-school job...

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,450
我就知道我要成为他们的一份子 I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

32
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,030
我有种归属感 It was there that I knew I belonged.

33
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,690
对我来说是一种成就感 在一个充满了无名小卒的环境中 To me it meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

34
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,930
他们不像别人 他们能随心所欲 They weren't like anybody else. They did whatever they wanted.

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,700
他们在消防栓前面停车而从来也不会被开罚单 They double-parked in front of a hydrant nobody ever gave them a ticket.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,200
夏天通宵赌扑克 In the summer when they played cards all night...

37
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,500
也没人敢叫警察 nobody ever called the cops.

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,550
东尼·史达斯 你好吗 Tony Stacks. How are you?

39
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,350
杜迪·西席罗 Tuddy Cicero.

40
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,760
这就是加拿希小子吗 Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
- 你好吗 - 蛮好的 - How are you? - Good.

42
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,390
杜迪 Tuddy.

43
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,360
杜迪的大哥保利是整个社区的大老板 Tuddy ran the cabstand and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,170
他替他打理计程车站和贝拉维斯塔披萨屋等地点 and other places for his brother Paul who was the boss of the neighborhood.

45
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,080
保利看起来动作很慢 Paulie might have moved slow...

46
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,510
那是因为保利不需要为任何人做事 but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody.

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,790
- 都是你不好 - 是你先开始的 - It's your fault. - You started it.

48
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,990
我先开始的 是你不好 I started it? It's your fault.

49
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,600
起先我父母都很高兴我在对街找到一份工作 At first my parents loved that I found a job across the street from the house.

50
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,470
我父亲是爱尔兰人 他十一岁就被送去工作了 My father who was Irish was sent to work at the age of 11.

51
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,570
他很高兴我找到工作 He liked that I got myself a job.

52
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,270
他常说美国孩子都被惯坏了 He always used to say that American kids were spoiled lazy.

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,710
- 爸 再见 - 再见 - Bye Dad. - Bye.

54
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,550
再见 米奇 See you Mikey.

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,880
再见 亨利 Bye Henry.

56
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,040
亨利 过马路要小心呀 Henry! Watch how you cross!

57
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,620
记得带牛奶回来 Bring back milk!

58
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,920
我妈妈也高兴呀 当她知道西席罗家 My mother was happy after she found out that the Ciceros...

59
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,620
和她是从西西里同一个地区出来的 对我妈妈而言 came from the same part of Sicily as she did. To my mother...

60
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
就像她的祷告都应验了 that was the answer to all her prayers.

61
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,500
我是世上最幸运的小孩 I was the luckiest kid in the world.

62
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,500
我可以到任何地方 做任何事 I could go anywhere I could do anything.

63
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,340
我认识每一个人 大家也都认识我 I knew everybody and everybody knew me.

64
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,580
兄弟们开车来 杜迪就让我 Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy would toss me their keys...

65
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,480
帮他们停凯迪拉克车 and let me park their Cadillacs.

66
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,210
那时候我还是个小鬼 Here I am this little kid

67
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,240
坐在方向盘后面 连路都看不见 I can't even see over the steering wheel...

68
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,580
就能停凯迪拉克了 and I'm parking Cadillacs.

69
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,880
可是 没多久 But it wasn't too long...

70
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,960
我父母就反对我在计程车站的工作了 before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand.

71
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,760
给你妈妈跟妹妹 For your mother and sister.

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,230
对他们来说 计程站的工作只是零工 对我 For them the cabstand was supposed to be a part-time job. But for me...

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,370
却是全天候 it was definitely full-time.

74
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,470
我唯一想做的事 That's all I wanted to do.

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,800
像我爸爸这种人永远也不会了解 我是其中的一份子 People like my father could never understand but I was a part of something.

76
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,780
我有所属 他们以成人待我 I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

77
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,110
告诉他519 Tell him 519.

78
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,280
每天我都在学些有用的技巧 Every day I was learning to score.

79
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,940
这里一块钱 那里一块钱 A dollar here a dollar there.

80
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,020
我好像活在梦幻里 I was living in a fantasy.

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
今天在学校还顺利吗 Did you have a good day at school?

82
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,060
父亲总是非常生气 My father was always pissed off.

83
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,360
他气自己赚钱太少 Pissed that he made such lousy money...

84
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,470
他气弟弟米奇活在轮椅上 pissed that my kid brother Michael was in a wheelchair.

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,870
他气我们一家七口挤在一间小房子里 He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.

86
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,000
你跟我说说这个 Tell me about this.

87
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,430
是学校来的信 It's a letter from school.

88
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,780
信上说你已经几个月没上学了 It says you haven't been there in months.

89
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,380
几个月了 In months!

90
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,640
你是个没用的混球 You're a bum!

91
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,910
你长大想做个流浪汉吗 Want to grow up to be a bum?

92
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,620
过了一阵子之后 他气我整天泡在计程车站 After a while he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand.

93
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,690
他知道站里有些什么勾当 He knew what went on at that cabstand.

94
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,490
我经常挨揍 可是我已经不在乎了 Every once in a while I'd have to take a beating. But by then I didn't care.

95
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,530
就我看来 The way I saw it...

96
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,500
每个人都有挨揍的时候 everybody takes a beating sometime.

97
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,440
- 我不能再送货了 - 什么 你这样会把所有事都搞砸 - I can't make any more deliveries. - What? You'll fuck everything up.

98
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,670
我老爸说他会杀了我 你看 My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

99
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,280
跟我来 Come on with me.

100
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,450
- 那是送信到你家的邮差吗 - 不是 - Is that him kid? - No.

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,850
- 那一个呢 - 也不是 - How about him? - No.

102
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,880
- 那个就是 - 去找他 - That's the guy. - Get him.

103
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,020
抱歉 Excuse me.

104
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,860
- 人渣 - 你这块狗屎 给我过来 - Scumbag. - Come here you piece of shit.

105
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,770
- 认识这个小鬼吗 - 认得呀 - Know this kid? - Yeah.

106
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,500
- 你知道他住哪里吗 - 知道 - Know where he lives? - Yeah.

107
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,910
- 这家的信是由你送的吗 - 是的 - You deliver mail to his house? - Yeah.

108
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,840
从现在起 任何从学校寄给他家的信都给我 From now on any letter from that school to his house comes directly here.

109
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,210
- 你懂吗 - 懂 - Understand? - Yeah.

110
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,940
假如再有一封学校的信送进那小鬼家里的话 Another letter from that school goes to that kid's house...

111
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,610
你会被塞进烤披萨的炉子里 in the fucking oven you'll go head first.

112
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,120
就这样 再也没有缺课的来信 再也没有学校的来信 That was it. No more letters from truant officers. No letters from school.

113
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,350
其实 任何信件都没有了 In fact no more letters from anybody.

114
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,330
最后 经过几星期 我妈妈去邮局抱怨了 Finally after a few weeks my mother went to the post office to complain.

115
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,330
从那以后 我怎么能回到学校去发誓效忠国旗 How could I go to school after that...

116
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,370
我又怎能坐在那里听政府如何好的屁话呢 and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?

117
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,870
保利最恨电话了 他不肯在家里装电话 Paulie hated phones. He wouldn't have one in his house.

118
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,740
米奇打来了 要不要我回他电话 Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

119
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,710
好吧 打过去 All right make the call.

120
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,480
他的电话都是由别人传达给他 He got all his calls second hand. Then you'd have to call the people back...

121
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,680
然后手下再从公用电话回电 from an outside phone.

122
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,350
你有没有五分钱 帮我打个电话给他 Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

123
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,830
有几个混混整天就是忙着帮保利接电话 There were guys that's all they did all day was take care of Paulie's calls.

124
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,770
对一个整天忙碌不停的人来说 他很少跟人说话 For a guy who moved all day long Paulie didn't talk to six people.

125
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,940
假如工会有了问题或彩票上有争议 If there was a union problem or say a beef in the numbers...

126
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,570
只有高级干部可以跟保利商议 only the top guys could meet with Paulie to discuss the problem.

127
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,020
保利讨厌开会 凡事都是一对一解决 Everything was one-on-one. Paulie hated conferences.

128
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,220
他不要别人听到他说的话 He didn't want anybody hearing what he said...

129
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,690
或听到别人说给他听的话 and he didn't want anybody listening to what he was being told.

130
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,090
好几百人以保利当靠山 他们所赚的都给保利一份 Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie he got a piece of everything they made.

131
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,600
那就是保护费 就像在西西里 只不过这是美国 It was a tribute like in the old country except they were doing it in America.

132
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,230
保利也只不过保护他们不被别人欺侮诈骗 All they got from Paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off.

133
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,340
就是这样 FBI始终搞不懂这一点 That's what it's all about. That's what the FBI could never understand.

134
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,940
保利所做的 What Paulie and the Organization does...

135
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,050
就是保护那些无法受警察保护的人 is offer protection for people who can't go to the cops. That's it.

136
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,750
保利就像是兄弟们的警察局长 That's all it is. They're like the police department for wiseguys.

137
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,660
别人看我的眼光都不一样 因为我和大人物在一起 People looked at me differently and they knew I was with somebody.

138
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,170
我连礼拜天买新鲜面包都用不着排队了 I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.

139
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,710
老板知道我跟谁在一起 The owner knew who I was with...

140
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
他会从柜台后面走出来 不管有多少人在等 and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many were waiting...

141
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,400
他都会先招呼我 I was taken care of first.

142
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,980
邻居再也不将车停在我们车道上了 Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore...

143
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,780
虽然我们没有车 我十三岁的时候 even though we didn't have a car. At 13...

144
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,820
我赚的钱已经比附近的大人还多 I was making more money than most of the grown-ups around.

145
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,120
我的钱多得花不完 要什么有什么 I had more money than I could spend. I had it all.

146
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,930
有一天 附近几个孩子们还帮我妈把菜拎回家 One day some neighborhood kids carried my mother's groceries all the way home.

147
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,540
知道为什么吗 You know why?

148
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,210
因为他们尊敬我 It was out of respect.

149
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,040
妈妈 你认为如何 Hi Mom what do you think?

150
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,350
- 你看我的鞋 很棒吧 - 老天呀 - Look at my shoes aren't they great? - My God.

151
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,480
你看上去像个黑帮分子 You look like a gangster.

152
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,350
他们射中我了 救命 They shot me. Help!

153
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,690
亨利 把门关上 Henry shut the door.

154
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,000
那是我第一次看到枪击 That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.

155
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,930
别在店里搞这些 天呐 Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

156
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,040
我不准在这里弄这种事 I can't have that in this joint.

157
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,900
我记得我为那个人感到难过 I remember feeling bad about the guy...

158
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,240
我也记得或许杜迪是对的 but I also remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.

159
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,140
我知道保利不要有任何人死在屋里 I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.

160
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,110

161
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,550
你他妈的到底怎么了 我要让这个小鬼长进一点 What the hell's wrong with you? I got to toughen this kid up.

162
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,140
那真是一段光彩的日子 It was a glorious time.

163
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,670
到处都是兄弟们 And wiseguys were all over the place.

164
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,580
那是在阿帕拉钦事件之前 It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe...

165
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,650
在疯子周和老大开战前 decided to take on a boss and start a war.

166
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,380
我就是那时候认清世界 It was when I met the world.

167
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,250
并认识吉米·康威 And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.

169
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,960
但已经是个传奇人物了 but he was already a legend.

170
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,130
他只要一走进来 厅里所有的人就像发疯一样 He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.

171
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,900
帮他开门 就给一百块小费 He'd give the doorman $100 just for opening the door.

172
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,970
他常塞百元大钞给那些发牌跟主持赌局的人 He'd give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games.

173
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,110
连酒保也有百元小费 只要冰块够冰的话 The bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

他第一次被关起来时才十一岁 He was first locked up at 11...

180

吉米一点也不在乎杀人 那是他的职业 See hits never bothered Jimmy. It was business.

182
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,640

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,790
任何人敢抱怨两次以上 会被揍得不敢再抱怨第三次了 If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad they never complained again.

274
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,460
一切都好像顺理成章 根本不用多伤脑筋 It was just all routine. You didn't even think about it.

275
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,080
520和469有什么关系 Frankie what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?

276
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,640
真不相信有这种人 I can't believe this guy.

277
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,770
520和469根本差太远了 520 ain't even close to 469. What's that got to do with anything?

278
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,750
简单得很 万事俱备 Piece of cake. It's all there.

279
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,220
不用担心警铃 我在想办法把钥匙弄到手 Don't worry about the alarms. I just gotta find a way to get the key.

280
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,880
- 不会有问题吧 - 我会把事弄妥的 - No problem right? - I'll take care of it.

281
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,830
- 把你告诉我的事告诉他 - 好得难以置信 - Tell him what you were telling me. - Too good to be true.

282
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,500
法国航空公司有大生意了 有一袋袋的钱要托运 Big score coming from Air France. Bags of money coming in.

283
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,200
美国的观光客和军人 他们把美金换成法郎 Tourists and American servicemen change their money...

284
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,280
美金又被运回来 into French money and send it back here.

285
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,510
- 冷静一点 - 太美了 - Calm down. - It's beautiful.

286
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,180
完全无法追踪 It's totally untraceable. Okay?

287
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,020
唯一的问题就是怎么拿到钥匙 但我已经想到办法了 The only problem is getting a key but I've got a plan.

288
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,560
- 我和法国佬和这个国民 - 这笨蛋很容易操纵的 - Me and Frenchy and this citizen. - Yeah he's a piece of work.

289
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,600
假如我估计正确 那里有50万现金 If I'm right there could be $500000 coming in all cash.

290
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,400
他说最好在周末下手 也许礼拜六晚上 The best time is probably over a weekend. So maybe Saturday night.

291
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,560
礼拜一是犹太教假日 There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

292
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,070
要到礼拜二才会被发现 太美了 They won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.

293
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,070
警卫怎么办 What about the security?

294
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,470
警卫吗 Security?

295
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,870
这位就是 笑死了 我就是午夜到早上八点的班 You're looking at it. It's a joke. I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

296
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,540
我就是总司令 I'm the commandant.

297
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,480
他就像来招领失物一样就行了 He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage.

298
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,180
- 太美了 - 不会出任何问题的 - It's beautiful. - It won't be a problem at all.

299
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,920
- 好 - 就这么办 - Good. - We're on.

300
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,550
最可笑的是在席考克斯抢银行那一次 What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

301
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,820
我正躺在草里 I'm in the middle of the weeds lying down.

302
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,220
警察走过来问我 你在干什么 He says "What are you doing?"

303
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,200
我说 我在休息呀 I said "I'm resting."

304
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,160
这不是公园或海滩 我说 我在休息 "Here? This ain't no beach or park." I said "I'm resting."

305
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,740
他们把我捉进去问东问西 He pulls me in starts asking questions. You know this and that.

306
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,850
你要告诉我们些什么呢 我说 一如往常 零 "What are you going to tell us?" I said "My usual. Nothing."

307
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,380
为什么要告诉你 干 他说 今天你非说不可 "Why tell you?" The fuck. He says "No you'll tell me something today."

308
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,020
我说 那好 你去操你妈吧 I said "Okay go fuck your mother."

309
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,630
你看报纸了没有 安东尼 我的头肿得这么大 You saw the paper Anthony. My head was out like this.

310
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,800
当我醒过来 Now I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?

311
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,630
这死家伙又站在我面前 你现在还有什么话说 This prick again. He says "What do you want to tell me now?"

312
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,760
你在这儿干嘛 我不是叫你去操你妈吗 I said "What are you doing here? I told you to go fuck your mother."

313
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,900
我以为他会拉在裤子里 I thought he was gonna shit.

314
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,040
我又被揍了一顿 那时候我真希望我是个大个子 The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

315

你说我讲话的样子吗 You mean the way I talk? What?

320

323
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,070
- 汤米 你误会了 - 安东尼 - Tommy you got it all wrong. - Anthony.

324
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,410
他又不是小孩子 让他自己解释 到底怎么有趣法 He's a big boy. He knows what he said. What did you say?

325
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,880

让我把事情弄清楚 Let me understand this.

327
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,450
也许我有点醉了 Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

328
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,960

他妈的 他差点被我唬住了 Motherfucker! I almost had him!

337
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,400
你这个讲话结巴的死家伙 你 You stuttering prick you!

338
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,500
法兰基 他有没有发抖 Frankie was he shaking?

339
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,370
我真担心你 亨利 你经不起拷问 I wonder about you sometimes Henry. You may fold under questioning.

340
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,030
耶稣基督啊 Jesus Christ.

341
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,840
你在搞什么呀 我还以为我被捕了 What the fuck is it with you? I thought I was getting pinched already.

342
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,350
他靠着我脖子 好像秃鹰一样 你要什么 He's hanging on my fucking neck like a vulture. What do you want?

343
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,750
伙计他说不敢把帐单拿过来给你 This guy didn't want to come and give you the check.

344
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,850
你能不能结一下帐 Could you take care of this?

345
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,820
没问题 叫他记在我帐上 No problem. Tell him to put it on my tab. Of course.

346
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,890
我就是想跟你商量一下 That's what I want to talk to you about.

347
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,500
你的帐不只这些 你还欠我七千 It ain't just this one. It's seven big ones you owe me.

348
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,460

349
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,660
你不想失礼 Don't mean to be out of order?

350
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,930
好在你不想失礼 It's good you don't mean to be out of order.

351
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,800
在我朋友面前说我赖帐 Embarrassing me in front of my friends like I'm a deadbeat.

352
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,840

358
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,430
真有这种人 Do you believe this prick?

359
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,010
你也应该对他们狠一点 You're supposed to be doing this stuff too.

360
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,870
你真有意思 You're a funny guy.

361
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,910
- 这次你完了 亨利 - 不要这样 坐下 - That's it Henry. - No go back.

362
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,750
你想笑吗 这混蛋上礼拜还叫我给他儿子洗礼呢 You want to laugh? This prick last week asked me to christen his kid.

363
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,190
我就算他七千块吧 I charged him $7000.

364
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,720
你真笑死我了 You really are a funny guy.

365
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,490
我很担心 我听到些奇奇怪怪的事 I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of fucking bad things.

366
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,840
汤米对待我的方式就好像我是什么怪物 同性恋似的 He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

367
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,530
我没办法逃避他 I got to go on the lam in order to get away from this guy.

368
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,700
他这样是不对的 我没地方好去 This ain't right. I can't go here I can't go there.

369
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,210
不是只有你 我跟兄弟们说了很多次了 他们不听 You think you're the only one? I talk to them they don't listen.

370
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,320
假如你跟他说 他会听的 If you tell him he'll stop. I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

371
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,510
否则我会被发现死在后车厢或草丛里 They'll find me in the back of a car somewhere in the weeds.

372
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,180
没人比你更清楚汤米 You've known this Tommy all your life. Who knows better?

373
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,850
这家伙是终极罪犯 This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

374
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,660
我每天出门的时候都担心会遭暗算 When I leave my house before I get to the car I look over both shoulders.

375
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,270
我没法活下去了 This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

376
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,730
我跟了你一辈子 你说我该怎么办 I'm around you all my life tell me what I gotta do.

377
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,700
- 我必须怎么做 就怎么做 - 我能做什么呢 - Whatever I got to do I'm gonna do. - What could I do?

378
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,970
如果我能帮上忙 我一定会做的 If there was something I could do I would. I would like to help you out.

379
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,800
桑尼 告诉他我们谈的事 Sonny tell him what we talked about.

380
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,170
- 你觉得妥当吗 - 说吧 - You think it's all right? - Yeah.

381
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,580
我希望你成为我店里的股东之一 那就好了 Maybe you could come in with me take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

382
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,730
你在说什么 你是说餐厅 What are you talking about? You mean the restaurant?

383
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,620
那是个高级地方 It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

384
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,860
你去过很多次了 You've been in there a million times. You know how it looks.

385
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,760
如果汤米接去做 简直像给猪戴丝帽一样 Tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

386
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,930
我不是看不起他 事实是如此 I don't mean no disrespect but that's the way it is.

387
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,540
我还能说什么 我是在求你 I know you're his friend. I'm begging you. What can I say?

388
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,180
我能做什么 What am I gonna do? What do you want from me?

389
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,110
我对餐厅一窍不通 I don't know anything about the restaurant business. Nothing.

390
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,720
我只会点菜而已 All I know is to sit down and order a meal not how to make a restaurant.

391
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,120
不是要你去管理 你只是多一个地方走动而已 Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

392
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,950
那里的厨师很棒 表演也很好 漂亮小妞也多 The chef is great. The shows are good. There's a lot of whores coming in.

393
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,060
我真的很愿意帮你 你要我怎么做 I'd love to help you but what do you want from me? What'll I do?

394
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,560
汤米是够坏的 难道要我枪毙他 Tommy's a bad kid a bad seed. What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

395
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,700
这倒不是个坏主意 That wouldn't be a bad idea.

396
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,110
对不起 我不是真心的 只是他令我害怕 I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it. I just mean that he's scaring me.

397
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,780
我需要你的帮忙 求求你 I just need help. Help me please.

398
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,020
餐厅生意你懂吗 You know anything about this restaurant business?

399
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,980
他什么都懂 他从早到晚都在那里 He knows everything. He's there 24 hours a day.

400
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,820
他就像那里的椅子一样 Another fucking few minutes he could be a stool.

401
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,550
永远都在里面 That's how often he's in there.

402
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,460
你要我做你的股东 搞了半天就是要我做你的股东是吗 You want me to be your partner? Is that what you're telling me?

403
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,190
你以为我在说什么 好不好 保利 What the fuck you think I'm talking about? Paulie please. Come on.

404
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,340
那太不公平了 It's not even fair.

405
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,030
别这么说 You don't understand.

406
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,640
好吧 你管理 我来从旁协助 You run the joint. Maybe I'll try to help you all right.

407
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,900
上帝保佑你 保利 我真的很感激你 你对我真好 God bless you Paulie. I appreciate it. You've always been fair with me.

408
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,950
现在桑尼有保利撑腰了 发生任何问题他都找保利 Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner. Any problems he goes to Paulie.

409
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,210
有人不付钱 他就找保利 Trouble with a bill he can go to Paulie.

410
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,510
警察 送货的 甚至汤米给他找麻烦 Trouble with the cops deliveries Tommy...

411
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,980
他都能去找保利 he can call Paulie.

412
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,950
可是现在他每星期得付保利保护费 Now the guy's gotta come up with Paulie's money every week...

413
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,180
无论状况如何 no matter what.

414
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,420
生意不好吗 去你的 付钱 店失火啦 去你的 付钱 "Business is bad? Fuck you pay me. Had a fire? Fuck you pay me.

415
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,400
店被雷击中啦 去你的 付钱 "The place got hit by lightning? Fuck you pay me."

416
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,730
电视机给我一台好不好 Can I get one of those TVs?

417
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,560
保利可以为所欲为 Also Paulie could do anything.

418
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,760
特别是拿餐厅的信贷到处消费 Especially run up bills on the joint's credit. And why not?

419
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,910
反正不准备付钱的 Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.

420
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,040
货一旦从前门进 When deliveries are made at the front door...

421
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,910
就送出后门廉价拍卖 you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount.

422
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,350
二百块的一箱酒一百块卖出去 You take a $200 case of booze and sell it for $100.

423
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,080
也不要紧 反正都是净赚 It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

424
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,360
到最后 Then finally when there's nothing left...

425
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,510
真他妈够可惜了 Fucking shame.

426
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,860
别人不再借钱给你 厂商也不再送货了 ...when you can't borrow another buck or buy another case of booze...

427
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,760
你只好点根火柴把店烧了 领保险金 you bust the joint out. You light a match.

428
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,420
有什么够不到的 需要我帮你吗 Do you need help reaching anything?

429
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,930
你像在装饰一颗圣诞树一样 You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree.

430
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,300
你根本什么都不会 You don't know what you're doing.

431
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,070
她是从富人区来的 She's from the Five Towns.

432
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,840
谁呀 Who?

433
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,250
那个犹太马子 戴安 我想跟她上床 The Jew broad Diane I was telling you I'm going to shag.

434
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,910
我已经试了一个月了 I've been trying to bang her for a fucking month now.

435
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,320
问题就是她从不肯跟我单独约会 She won't go out with me alone.

436
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,520
- 不 - 什么不 - No. - No what?

437
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,790
不什么 我又没请你 No what? Who the fuck asked you anything?

438
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,900
我又没问你 至少听我说完好不好 I didn't ask you. Hear what I'm going to say.

439
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,620
好啦 什么啦 All right what?

440
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,330
好啦 是这样 Okay what.

441
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,160
她不肯跟意大利人出去 She don't want to go out with Italians alone.

442
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,530
她对意大利人有偏见 She's prejudiced against Italians.

443
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,110
什么时候了 还有这种事 You fucking believe that? In this day and age?

444
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,870
这是什么世界啊 What the fuck is this world coming to?

445
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,780
难以相信 一个犹太马子对意大利人有偏见 I can't believe this. A Jew broad prejudiced against Italians.

446
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,080
除非和她的女朋友一起 她绝不单独跟我约会 She won't go out with me alone unless her girlfriend comes with us.

447
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,220
所以我想你可以当她女朋友的伴 So you come along go out with her girlfriend.

448
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,220
看吧 我就知道 See? I knew it.

449
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,690
你知道什么 有什么不好 You knew what? What the fuck is wrong with that?

450
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,880
- 什么时候 - 明天晚上 - When is this? - Tomorrow night.

451
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,590
明晚不行 我要见杜迪 I can't I gotta meet Tuddy.

452
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,490
你可以早点出来 事后再去见杜迪 You could meet Tuddy. You can come early and then still go.

453
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,000
- 你怎么老是这样 - 别找理由了 - Why do you always do this? - Don't give me that shit.

454
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,660
我是找你帮忙 What did I ask you for? I'm asking you for a favor.

455
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
我帮过你不少忙的 I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

456
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,640
我想搞那娘们 你懂不懂 I'm trying to bang this fucking broad. Help me out.

457
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,880
她真的很漂亮 I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

458
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,110
住在高级区 这些犹太女孩很有钱 Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns. These Jews got money.

459
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,650
说不定整条街都是她家的 你也许会中头奖也不一定 Maybe the family owns the whole block. You may wind up with a big score.

460
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,850
光听你讲犹太女朋友好了 You with your fucking mouth.

461
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,700
我约了杜迪十一点见 现在我正在给汤米做搭档 I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00 and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.

462
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,430
你吃饱了吗 How about it? Did you have enough to eat?

463
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,130
很好吃 我正在节食 It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

464
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,640
让我替你注意身材就好了 Let me watch your figure.

465
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,330
我等不及离开 I couldn't wait to get away.

466
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,070
他们还在吃主菜 我就已经叫点心了 I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner.

467
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,740
他们还在喝咖啡 我就先结帐了 When they were having coffee I was asking for a check.

468
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,070
我有事情 I had business.

469
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,740
喝点咖啡吧 会清醒一点 Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

470
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,020
- 帐单给我 - 你急什么呀 - Can we have the check? - What are you doing?

471
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,320
- 我得走了 - 我们才刚到 - I got to go. - We just got here.

472
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,480
我还有事 我要走了 I got that thing. I gotta go.

473
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,790
再等几分钟 我们一起离开好吗 Wait a couple of minutes. We'll leave together.

474
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,760
这样才不会像一群流浪汉 一个一个走 This way we don't go out like a bunch of hobos one at a time.

475
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,160
我受不了他 I couldn't stand him.

476
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,660
我觉得他真的很倒胃口 I thought he was really obnoxious.

477
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,860
四肢一直摆弄着 He kept fidgeting around.

478
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,810
可不可以不要玩打火机 很烦 You don't mind do you? That's very annoying.

479
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,580
也许甜酒比较适合你 但我喝就不像样了 Good? You might prefer Manischewitz but it'd look funny on my table.

480
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,890
- 可以走了吧 - 亨利 放松一点嘛 - Ready? - Henry lighten up.

481
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,290
我们才刚到 别紧张 好不好 We just got here. What are you doing?

482
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,690
回家的时候还没到 他就把我推进车门 Before it was time to go home he was pushing me into the car...

483
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,200
又拉了出来 太荒唐了 then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

484
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,060
戴安和汤米 Diane and Tommy made us promise...

485
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,140
又约我们星期五见 to meet them again on Friday night.

486
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,460
我们答应了 We agreed.

487
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,300
果不其然 星期五晚上亨利没来 Of course when Friday night came around Henry stood me up.

488
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,270
真抱歉 我不知道他在哪 I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

489
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,810
可是他真的很喜欢你 他一直不停地谈她 He really liked you too. All he did was talk about her.

490
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,470
那天约会之夜只有我们三个人 We were a trio instead of a double date that night.

491
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,450
他该来通电话 我真担心 希望不是太严重 He would have called. I hope it's nothing serious.

492
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,320
我逼汤米带我去找他 But I made Tommy take me looking for him.

493
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,420
汤米 你搞什么 Tommy what the fuck?

494
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,390
你真有种呀 跟我爽约 You got some nerve standing me up.

495
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,970
从来没有人敢这样对我 Nobody does that to me.

496
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,800
你以为你是谁 像法兰奇·瓦利那样的大歌星吗 Who do you think you are Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

497
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,830
慢着好不好 我忘了 我以为是下星期 Slow down I forgot. I thought it was next week.

498
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,270
是这个星期五 你答应的 你这个骗子 It was this Friday and you agreed so you're a liar!

499
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,210
别这样 别这样 我们好好谈一下 We can talk about this. Take it easy.

500
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,820
有什么好谈的 Talk about it?

501
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,420
去你的吧 我们没什么好谈的 Talk to you after what you just did to me? Forget it.

502
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,380
我以为你不会来的 你那天什么也不说 一副无聊的样子 I thought you would stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

503
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,690
再给我一次补偿的机会吧 Let me make it up to you.

504
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,160
让我考虑一下 I'll think about it.

505
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,860
我记得她在街上大喊大叫 I remember she was screaming on the street and I mean loud.

506
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,260
可是看起来真动人 But she looked good.

507
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,670
我会考虑考虑 不过有代价的 希尔 I'll think about it. But it'll cost you Hill. A lot.

508
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,430
她的眼睛真美 就像伊莉莎白·泰勒（好莱坞女星）一样 She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.

509
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,670
至少我这么觉得 At least that's what I thought.

510
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,170
哈罗 亨利 Hello Henry.

511
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,680
- 你准备好了吗 - 好了 - You're ready? - Yeah.

512
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,840
那走吧 Come on.

513
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,780
- 不 等一下 - 什么 - No wait a minute. - What?

514
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,780
快 把十字架盖起来 我妈看到她会认为你是基督徒（犹太人不信基督教） Quick you have to cover that cross. My mother sees that...

515
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,180
凯伦 Karen.

516
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,780
妈 Mom.

517
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,260
- 这是我朋友亨利·希尔 - 你好吗 - I'd like you to meet my friend Henry Hill. - How do you do?

518
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,420
我女儿说你是半个犹太人 My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

519
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,470
好的一半是 It's just the good half.

520
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,230
- 谢谢 先生 - 谢谢 - Thank you sir. - Bye see you later thanks.

521
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,630
你干嘛把车停在这里 What're you doing? You're leaving your car?

522
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,470
他会替我看着 He watches the car for me.

523
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,340
比停在停车场快多了 It's easier than leaving it at a garage and waiting.

524
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,380
这样快多了 懂我意思吗 It's a lot quicker that way you know what I mean?

525
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,920
我喜欢从这里走 比排队好 I like going in this way. It's better than waiting in line.

526
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,990
你好 一切都好吧 这给你 How are you doing? What's up? Here you go.

527
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,140
- 你好吗 - 你好 - How are you doing? - I'm doing all right.

528
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:21,610
我每次来 你们两个都在这里 不用工作吗 Every time I come here every time you two. Don't you work?

529
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,730
你好吗 嗨 你好吗 Henry nice to see you. Hi how are you?

530
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,960
安东尼 摆在最前面 Anthony right in the front.

531
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,400
如果需要什么 告诉我就好了 Anything you need just let me know.

532
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,420
东尼 真是谢了 我很感激 Tony thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

533
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,000
- 你给他们每人二十块钱 - 没关系的 - You gave them $20 each. - It's all right.

534
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,570
亨利 这是东尼先生送的 Henry this is with Mr. Tony over there.

535
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,040
- 在哪里 - 就在这边 - Where? - Over there.

536
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,180
谢了 东尼 Thanks a lot Tony.

537
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,810

572
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,450
一个21岁的年轻人有这样的关系 I didn't think there was anything strange in any of this.

不要买会掉下来的假发 Don't buy wigs that come off at the wrong time.

但有些事不合理 But there's something unreasonable going on here.

588
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,910
吉米太狠了 Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

589

我赌克里夫兰队 下注8:5 Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

590
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,750
我没法付那么高的利息 I never had to pay the vigorish he demands. Am I something special?

591
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,590
你以为我是什么 白痴呀 What am I a schmuck on wheels?

他开始摸我 抓我 He started to touch me. He stared to grab me.

621
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,820
我叫他住手 他不听 I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

622

- 把枪藏起来 你没事吧 - 没事 - Hide this. Are you all right? - Yeah.

630

我知道 一般女孩一定会和男朋友分手 I know there are women like my best friends...

631
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,980
如果她男朋友拿一支枪 who would have gotten out the minute their boyfriend...

你老是一个接一个的换 And you're still bouncing around from girl to girl.

639
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,920
亨利好像有两个家庭 It was like he had two families.

640
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,360
他把他们介绍给我时真是多到疯掉 The first time I was introduced to all of them at once it was crazy.

641

652
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,930
保利 你太客气了 Paulie you shouldn't have.

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,700
他和朋友在一起 爸爸 He's with his friends! Dad!

675
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,740
不要把你爸爸扯进来 Leave him out of this. He's suffered enough.

676
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,880
他已经有六星期消化不良了 He hasn't digested a decent meal in six weeks.

677
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,820
你去了些什么地方 为什么不打电话 Where were you? Why didn't you call?

678
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,660
我们担心死了 已婚男人不该整夜不归 We were worried to death. A married man does not stay out like this.

679
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,300
正常人没有这种行为的 Normal people don't act like this!

680
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,540
你哪里不对劲 What's wrong with you?

681
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,810
她没说错 你是不正常 你哪里不对劲 You're not normal. She's right. What's wrong with you?

682
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,140
你有什么毛病 你是什么样的人 What kind of person are you? What is the matter with you?

683
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,950
他们那些家伙是哪种人 What kind of people are they?

684
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,320
我们嫁的不是上班族 We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.

685
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,260
让我感到有多不同 But the first time I realized how different...

686
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,800
是在美琪的家庭聚会时 was when Mickey had a hostess party.

687
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,130
- 凯伦 你是哪里人 - 劳伦斯 - Karen where you from? - Lawrence.

688
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,570
在长岛 不错呀 我生在迈阿密 你去过吗 On the Island. It's nice. I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

689
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,440
那里还不错 像个犹太天堂 It's okay but it's like you died and woke up in Jew heaven.

690
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,340
不要老挤痘子嘛 Angie stop picking at that thing.

691
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,880
我真想揍他的脸 I'd like to smack his face.

692
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,640
那个红发男人 The red-haired guy looks like a farmer?

693
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,840
他都要动手动脚的 The guy's hands are all over me.

694
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,390
我说 不要对我动手 否则我把它切下来 So I told him "Keep your fucking hands off me or I'll cut them off."

695
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,390
她是认真的 She means it.

696
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,620
他不知道多走运 如果我告诉韦力 You don't know how lucky he is. I just mention this to Vinnie...

697
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,520
你怎么能告诉韦力 他非杀了他不可 How can you mention it? Vinnie would kill him.

698
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,570
说出来 韦力杀了他 又得去坐一辈子牢 If I don't he'll kill the miserable bastard then Vinnie will be there for life.

699
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,370
你以为只有你有麻烦呀 珍妮的儿子更糟 You think you got problems. What about Jeannie's kid?

700
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,270
在一场只有10元输赢的扑克中和人争执起来 他拿出枪 He was in an argument. A $10 card game. He pulls out a gun.

701
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,240
枪走火 打死一个男孩 当他祖母听到他在牢里 The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed. When the grandmother hears it...

702
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,350
心脏病发作 当场就死了 and finds out he's jailed she has a heart attack and drops dead right on the spot.

703
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,920
现在珍妮的老公和孩子在牢里 妈妈在殡仪馆 Now Jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

704
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,520
- 珍妮酗酒 - 也许她是心情不好 - Jeannie drinks. - Maybe she's depressed.

705
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,850
饶了我吧 她根本就是酗酒 Give me a break. She's drunk.

706
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,660
只要有点事发生 他们都成圣人了 As soon as something happens you make them out to be saints.

707
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:17,770
她们皮肤粗糙 化妆太浓 气色不好 They had bad skin and wore too much makeup. They didn't look very good.

708
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,730
她们看起来很憔悴 穿的衣服 They looked beat-up. And the stuff they wore...

709
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,770
也是不成套的廉价品 was thrown together and cheap.

710
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,610
都是些裤装 针织品 A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

711
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,240
她昼夜穿睡袍 She spends her life in a nightgown.

712
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,720
相信我 她不是什么好东西 The woman is no angel believe me.

713
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,380
她们谈论着她们的孩子多坏 They talked about their rotten kids...

714
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,120
她们用扫把揍孩子 她们用皮鞭揍孩子 and about beating them with broom handles and belts.

715
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,230
但孩子们一点也不理会 And that the kids still didn't pay any attention.

716
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,290
当亨利来接我的时候 我整个头都晕了 When Henry picked me up I was dizzy.

717
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,130
我不知道我能不能适应这种生活 I don't know if I could live like that.

718
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,830
你要是进了监牢 我怎么办 God forbid what would happen if you had to go to prison?

719
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,370
凯伦 Karen.

720
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,030
美琪谈到了珍妮的丈夫 Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

721
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,470
你知道怎么回事吗 Do you know why Jeannie's husband went to the can?

722
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,010
珍妮的丈夫是为了逃避珍妮才去坐牢的 Because of Jeannie. He wanted to get away from her.

723
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,910
你听我说 坐牢的都是想坐牢的 Let me tell you something. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

724
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,190
都是甘愿被捕的 Unless they make themselves get caught.

725
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,120
他们没把事情安排好 They don't have things organized.

726
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,590
我都把事弄妥了 I know what I'm doing. I've got things organized with these guys.

727
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,000
你知道哪些人坐牢吗 You know who goes to jail?

728
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,130
黑人抢劫犯 你知道他们为什么会被捕吗 Nigger stickup men. You know why they get caught?

729
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,990
因为他们在逃走用的车上睡着了 Because they fall asleep in the getaway car Karen.

730
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,230
凯伦 不要瞎担心了 甜心 过来吧 Come on don't worry so much sweetie. Come here.

731
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,430
渐渐地 一切都好像很正常了 After a while it got to be all normal.

732
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,600
没有一样像犯罪 None of it seemed like crime.

733
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,070
亨利就像在经营企业 It was more like Henry was enterprising...

734
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,940
他和伙伴以诈骗为生而已 and that he and the guys made bucks hustling while other guys...

735
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:46,100
至少他们不坐着等别人来救济 were sitting on their asses waiting for handouts.

736
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,870
我们的丈夫不是脑外科医生 他们是靠努力赚钱的 Our husbands weren't brain surgeons they were blue-collar guys.

737
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,620
他们只有多偷 多抢 才能多赚点钱 The only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut corners.

738
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,650
钱箱在那里 讨人厌的东西 Where's the strong box you varmint?

739
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,400
你他妈的别动 Don't fucking move! Don't move.

740
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,540
- 餐厅见了 - 我坐副驾驶座 - See you at the diner. - I'm riding shotgun.

741
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,380
你看他刚才立刻就服软了 Did you see him give it right over?

742
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:25,210
走吧 回老巢去分钱吧 Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

743
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,460
我们非常亲近 We were all so very close.

744
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,500
从来不跟外人来往 绝不 There were never any outsiders around. Absolutely never.

745
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,330
就因为这样 一切好像更正常了 Being together all the time made everything seem all the more normal.

746
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,830
哈罗 希尔太太 警察 Hello Mrs. Hill. Police.

747
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,300
我是迪西警探 他是席维思警探 我们有搜查令 I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

748
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,530
请看一下 然后签名 Would you read and sign it?

749
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,180
- 哪里都行吗 - 是的 - Anywhere? - Yeah anywhere.

750
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,910
要耽误一点时间 我们每样都要仔细查 This'll take a while we have to go through everything.

751
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,140
- 你们要咖啡吗 - 不用了 谢谢你 - You boys want some coffee? - No coffee now thanks.

752
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,310
- 请当心点 - 我们只是照常执行任务 - Be careful. - We'll just go about our business.

753
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,860
警察经常会找些小麻烦 There was always a little harassment.

754
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,820
他们要跟亨利谈东谈西 They wanted to talk to Henry about this or that.

755
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,230
他们带着传票和搜查令来叫我签名 They'd make me sign their subpoenas or warrants.

756
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,760
不论他们搜到什么 But mostly they just wanted a handout.

757
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,300
几块钱也就把他们打发了 A few bucks to keep things quiet no matter what they found.

758
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,510
我每次都问他们 要不要咖啡 有的太太 像美琪 I always asked if they wanted coffee. Some wives like Mickey Conway...

759
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,550
她总是诅咒他们 还吐口水在地板上 used to curse at them and spit on the floor.

760
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,310
我永远也不了解为什么要吐在自己的地板上 She used to spit on her own floor. That never made any sense to me.

761
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,510
还是礼貌一点 然后打电话给律师比较好 It was better to be polite and call the lawyer.

762
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,130
我们总是在一起 总是同样一群人 We always did everything together and we always were in the same crowd.

763
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,260
纪念日 受洗等等 我们只到彼此的家去 Anniversaries christenings. We only went to each other's houses.

764
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,740
女士们一起玩牌 The women played cards.

765
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,970
凡有婴儿诞生 美琪和吉米总是最先到医院的 When kids were born Mickey and Jimmy were the first at the hospital.

766
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,210
当我们去南海或赌城度假 When we went to the Islands or Vegas for vacation...

767
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,650
也都是一起的 we went together.

768
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,850
从来没有外人 好像那才是正常的 No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

769
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,050
我甚至对我丈夫的所作所为 It got to where I was proud that I had the kind of husband...

770
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,960
感到骄傲 who was willing to risk his neck just to get us the little extras.

771
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,060
我已经跟妈讲好了 明晚来替我们看孩子 But I got Mom to watch the babies tomorrow night.

772
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,070
- 我没办法 凯伦 - 为什么 - Can't do it Karen. - Why not?

773
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,900
就是不行嘛 我已安排好别的事了 I just can't. I got something lined up.

774
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,540
但妈妈只有明晚可以替我们看孩子 But tomorrow's the only night she can do it.

775
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:32,270
- 拜托嘛 好不好 - 我真的不行 你要我怎么办 - Pretty please? - I can't. What do you want me to do?

776
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,840
- 我得走了 - 等一下 - I got to go. - Wait a minute.

777
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,320
我要去逛街 给我点钱好吗 I wanted to go shopping. Can I get some money?

778
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,180
你需要多少 How much do you need?

779
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,860
- 多少 - 这么多 - How much? - That much.

780
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,530
这么多 亲我一下 This much. Give me a kiss.

781
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,770
待会见 See you later.

00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,070
好吧 All right.

783
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:20,750
纽约皇后区 1970年6月11日

你这小混球 我认识你一辈子了 You little prick. I've known you all my life.

802
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,830
- 不要长得太大了 - 你不要找我麻烦就好了 - Don't get too big on me. - Just don't bust my balls.

803
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,030
如果我要找你麻烦 我会叫你回去拿擦鞋盒来 If I was gonna break your balls I'd say "Go get your shine box."

804
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,970
这小鬼以前鞋擦得真亮 This kid was great.

805
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,270
他外号叫 亮光汤米 They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

806
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,470
他妈的简直像镜子一样 语气稍粗了 抱歉 He'd make your shoes look like fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

807
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:53,610
他真赚了不少钱 He was terrific. He was the best. He made a lot of money too.

808
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,480
不要再提擦鞋了 比利 No more shines Billy.

809
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,650
- 什么 - 我说不要再提擦鞋了 - What? - I said no more shines.

810
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,560
你离开了很长一段时间 他们没告诉你 You've been away a long time. They didn't tell you.

811
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,820
我不擦鞋了 I don't shine shoes anymore.

812
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:08,290
不要这么认真好不好 只是好玩的 给你找点小麻烦而已 Relax. What's got into you? I'm breaking your balls a little that's all.

813
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:09,770
我只是逗着你玩的 I'm only kidding with you.

814
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,270
有时你的语气不像在玩 这里有很多人 你知道吗 Sometimes you don't sound like it. There's a lot of people around.

815
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,570
我只是跟你开玩笑 我们在庆祝 I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

816
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,480
我好久没见你 只想逗逗你 你马上就变脸了 I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh.

817
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:21,580
对不起 我不是故意想惹你生气 I'm sorry I didn't mean to offend you.

818
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,120
抱歉 没事了 好了 I'm sorry too. It's okay. No problem.

819
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,820
回去把你的擦鞋箱拿来 Now go home and get your fucking shine box.

820
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,520

824
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,900
谁不知道你用钱买到你在帮中的地位 You bought your fucking button!

825
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,370
- 别紧张 - 你这个蓄生 - Don't get nervous. - You motherfucker!

826
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,310
把这王八蛋留在这里 Keep that motherfucker here! Keep him here.

827
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,970
来呀 你以为你很强吗 Come on you fucking feel strong?

828
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,280
汤米喝太多了 他并没恶意 Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded. He doesn't mean any disrespect.

829
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,940
他没有恶意 你疯啦 He doesn't mean any disrespect? Are you nuts?

830
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,550
应该教这小子一点礼貌 对就是对 Teach this kid a little fucking manners. What's right is right.

831
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,160
- 你知道我的意思吧 - 没关系 - You understand what I'm saying? - It's all right.

832
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:09,730
我是说那小子两分钟前还跟我行贴面礼 一转脸就六亲不认了 We're hugging and kissing over here and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

833
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,530
那是因为你讽刺他 你自己也有不对 You insulted him a little bit. You got a little out of order.

834
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,970
- 哪有 - 你有一点讽刺他 - I didn't. - You insulted him a little.

835
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,400
- 我没讽刺任何人 给我们来酒 - 好的 - I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink. - Okay.

836
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,070
我们都来一杯吧 我请客 Let's have some drinks. Drinks on the house.

837
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,300
不 由我来请 No have the drink with me.

838
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,480
比利 酒免费 The drinks are on the house.

839
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,280
我在牢里都强奸那种小子 I fucked kids like that in the can. In the ass.

840
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,610
他妈的 敢破坏我的庆祝会 Fucking break up my party.

841
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,630
时代变了 你离开六年了 You've been away for six years. It's different now.

842
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,130
我已经被惩罚过了 I did my fucking time Jimmy.

843
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:53,130
我回来了 我要我该有的一份 我得养家糊口 I came home and I want what I got to get. I got mouths to feed.

844
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,970
- 你会得到的 - 你能了解吧 - You're gonna get it. - You understand?

845
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,440
关上门 Get the door!

846
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,700
让我把子弹射进他的大烂嘴巴 Let me shoot him in his big fucking mouth!

847
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,420
枪毙了他 Let's shoot him.

848
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,320
死家伙把我鞋弄凹了 Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

849
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,080
他手下的人会到处找他的 His whole crew is going to be looking for him.

850
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:48,830
真糟糕 怎么处理他 总不能把他丢在街上 This is bad. What do we do with him? We can't just dump him on the street.

851
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,590
我知道郊外有个地方 谁也找不到 再拿几张桌布 I know a place upstate. They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

852
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,400
我本来不想把血溅在你地板上 I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

853
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,940
去把你的车厢打开 Go open your trunk.

854
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,040
到我妈妈家去拿一把铲子 We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

855
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:20,380
她有一把铲子就放在附近 小声一点 别把她吵醒 She has a shovel here somewhere. Quiet I don't want to wake her up.

856
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,760
看谁来了 Look who's here.

857
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,940
你们刚才在做什么 发生了什么事 What did you do? What happened?

858
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,630
我在路上撞了一只动物 吉米会告诉你 I hit something on the road. Jimmy will tell you.

859
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,000
发生什么事了 What happened to him?

860
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,910
我好久没看到你了 他怎么啦 I haven't seen you in so long. What happened to him?

861
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,940
你好吗 You too. How are you?

862
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,340
你怎么这么晚还不睡 Why are you up so late?

863
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,820
他来了 你们都来了 我好高兴看到他 He came in. You came in. I'm so happy to see him.

864
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:49,860
快进来吧 不要客气 我给你们弄点吃的 Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable. I'll make you something to eat.

865
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,760
- 你去睡吧 - 我睡不着 我好久没看到他了 - Go to sleep. We're leaving. - I can't. Not while he's home.

866
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,230
我好久没看到他了 我想陪陪他 I haven't seen him in so long. I want to see him.

867
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,630
你们进去吧 You go inside.

868
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,100
你们进去吧 This stuff is like lead.

869
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:01,360
告诉我 你去哪里了 我都没看见你 Tell me where you been? I haven't seen you.

870
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,230
也不打个电话回来 你都去哪了 You haven't called. Where have you been?

871
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:07,310
- 我在上夜班 - 然后呢 - I been working nights. - And?

872
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,270
今晚我们开车到郊外溜达 And tonight we were out late.

873
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,880
撞上一只鹿 We took a ride out to the country and hit a deer.

874
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,040
所以才有这些血 吉米不也告诉你了吗 That's where all the blood is from. Jimmy told you.

875
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,850
对了 我要借这把刀用一下 好吗 It reminds me I need this knife. I'm taking this okay?

876
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,890
- 用吧 - 我只需要用一下就好 - Okay. - Just for a while.

877
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,460
可怜的鹿 The poor thing.

878
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:27,390
我们撞到那只鹿的 那个 那个叫什么 We hit the deer and his paw... What do you call it?

879
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,150
前爪 The paw.

880
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,770
- 鹿蹄 - 他前蹄被卡住了 - The hoof. - Got caught in the grill.

881
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,760
我必须把它切下来 I got to hack it off.

882
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,200
如果不管它 那太不人道了 Ma it's a sin to leave it there.

883
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,240
刀用完我就送回来 I'll bring the knife back.

884
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,570
- 真好吃 美味 - 谢谢你 - Delicious. - Thank you.

885
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,970
你为什么不找个好姑娘 Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

886
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,980
我每天晚上都找好姑娘 I do almost every night.

887
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,670
我是说找个好女孩 能结婚安定下来 But get yourself a girl so you could settle down.

888
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,740
我每晚都安定下来 然后早上又自由了 I do every night. Then I'm free.

889
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,720
我爱你 只想和你在一起 I love you I want to be with you.

890
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,320
安定一下自己啦 Settle down.

891
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,820
亨利怎么样呀 How's your friend Henry?

892
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,360
怎么了 你不怎么讲话 What's the matter? You don't talk much.

893
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,290
对啊 这么安静做什么 Talk. What are you quiet for?

894
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,900
他吃得少 说话也少 You don't eat much you don't talk much.

895
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,560
- 我听着就好了 - 有什么不对劲吗 - I'm just listening. - Something wrong?

896
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,260
你让我想起我们小的时候 从意大利来的人都很亲近 When we were kids the compares used to visit each other.

897
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:16,240
有一个人从来不说话 他整晚坐着一句话都不说 There was this man. He would never talk. He'd just sit there all night not a word.

898
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:20,950
有人问他 你哪里不对劲呀 你会不会说话 They say to him "What's the matter? Don't you say anything?"

899
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:25,250
他说 你要我说什么 说我老婆爱偷情 He says "What am I going to say that my wife two-times me?"

900
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:29,150
他老婆说 闭嘴 你话太多了 So she says "Shut up! You're always talking."

901
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,520
不过这句话用意大利语说出来好听多了 But in Italian it sounds much nicer.

902
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,220
- 自得其乐 - 就是 满于现况 的意思 - Cornuto contento. - That's it.

903
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,030
- 什么意思呀 - 就是连那样他都满足 - What does that mean? - It means he's content to be a jerk.

904
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,130
别人怎么想 他才不在乎 He doesn't care who knows it.

905
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,100
- 汤米有没有告诉你们我画画 - 没有 - Did Tommy tell you about my painting? - No.

906
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,600
看看这个 Look at this.

907
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,140
真漂亮 It's beautiful.

908
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:52,340
一只狗脸朝这边 另一只脸朝那边 I like it. One dog goes one way and the other goes the other.

909
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,910
一只想到东部 一只想到西部 又怎样咧 One's facing east the other west. So what?

910
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,520
这人在说 你要我怎么样 他那头白发挺漂亮的 He's saying "What do you want from me?" The guy's got nice white hair.

911
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,850
漂亮 那只狗 看起来差不多 Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

912
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,010
这个人有点像我们认识的一个人 Looks like somebody we know.

913
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,890
去掉胡子不就是他吗 Without the beard. It's him.

914
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,730
就是他 It's him.

915
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,570
妈的 什么声音啊 What the fuck is that?

916
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,340
对大部分兄弟来说 杀人是被接受的 For most of the guys killings were accepted.

917
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,210
要令每个人服从 只有用处决来控制 Murder was the only way everybody stayed in line.

918
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,650
你如果越轨就会被除掉 规则大家都知道 You got out of line you got whacked. Everybody knew the rules.

919
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,260
有时候没越轨也会被除掉 Sometimes even if people didn't get out of line they got whacked.

920
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,860
有些兄弟已是杀人成性 动不动就挑衅 Hits became a habit. Guys would get into arguments over nothing.

921
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,220
时常 转眼就死了一个人 Before you knew it one was dead.

922
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,590
彼此常以枪相对 They were shooting each other all the time.

923
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,330
早已习以为常 不值得大惊小怪 Shooting people was a normal thing. It was no big deal.

924
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,770
我们跟比利·贝兹的事可不是件小事情 We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

925
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:56,040
汤米杀的是个大人物 地位很高的 This was really a touchy thing. Tommy killed a made guy.

926
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,770
贝兹是坎必诺家族的一员 这种人是不能随便杀的 Batts was part of the Gambino crew and was considered untouchable.

927
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,010
你得有充分的理由 Before you touched a made guy you had to have a good reason.

928
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,920
你得有上面正式的许可 You had to have a sit-down and you'd better get an okay...

929
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,420
否则 被杀的人就是你 or you'd be the one who got whacked.

930
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,470
星期六是太太之夜 Saturday night was for wives...

931
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,800
礼拜五是女朋友之夜 but Friday night at the Copa was for the girlfriends.

932
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,870
上星期我们看了山米·戴维斯的秀 Last week we saw Sammy Davis Jr.

933
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,950
太值得看了 好会表演 You got to see this show. What a performer.

934
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,610
他会模仿别人 听起来就跟真人一样 He does these impersonations. You'd think it was the real people.

935
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,880
真令人难以相信 难怪白人女孩为他倾心 It's unbelievable. You could see how a white girl could fall for him.

936
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,320
什么 What?

937
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,420
我不是说我 只是有的女孩 像那个瑞典女孩 Not me. But you could see how some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

938
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,760
换句话说 你赞同那种黑白关系 So you condone that stuff.

939
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,260
别那么认真 Take it easy.

940
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,840

这样很不好 你要把你们的问题解决一下 This is no good. You gotta straighten this thing out.

01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,040
放在锅里 加上一点油就化了 that it used to liquefy in the pan with just a little oil.

1211
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:28,200
那方法很好 It was a very good system.

1212
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:30,940
韦力掌管蕃茄汁 Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1213
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,520
闻到了没有 Get the smell?

1214
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:35,420
这肉丸里有三种肉 Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1215
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:37,610
有小牛肉 牛肉和猪肉 Veal beef and pork.

1216
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:40,080
那好 反正猪肉是一定要的 Good but you gotta have the pork.

1217
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,780
那是主要的味道来源 That's the flavor.

1218
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,420
我觉得他洋葱放多了 但味道还是很好 I felt he used too many onions but it was still a very good sauce.

1219
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,360
韦力 不要放太多洋葱 Vinnie don't put too many onions in the sauce.

1220
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:51,130
我没放太多 I didn't put too much onions in Paul.

1221
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,200
只放了三个小的而已 Put three small onions that's all I did.

1222
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,930
三个洋葱 那你放了几罐蕃茄酱 Three onions? How many cans of tomatoes you put in there?

1223
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,840
- 两大罐 - 你不需要放三个洋葱 - I put two big cans. - You don't need three onions.

1224
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:01,000
强尼煎牛排 Johnny Dio did the meat.

1225
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,780
因为没有烤箱 强尼用平底锅做菜 We had no broiler so Johnny did everything in pans.

1226
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:06,040
他每次都把屋子里弄得乌烟瘴气 It used to smell up the joint something awful...

1227
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:09,190
警卫都被熏死了 但他的牛排还真是不错 and the hacks used to die but he still cooked a great steak.

1228
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,880
- 你的牛排要怎么样 - 半生的 - How do you like yours? - Medium rare.

1229
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,620
半生 贵族一个 Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1230
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:18,790
当你想到监狱 脑中就会出现像电影中那样 You know when you think of prison you get pictures in your mind...

1231
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:22,600
一排排的人被关在铁栏杆后面 of all those old movies with rows of guys behind bars.

1232
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,670
对兄弟来说不是那样的 It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1233
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,500
并不是那么槽 除了我很想念吉米 It really wasn't that bad excepting that I missed Jimmy...

1234
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:29,070
他在亚特兰大受刑 who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1235
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,680
顺便给我两块牛排 好不好 Give me two steaks while you're in there all right?

1236
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:37,550
在里面的人都是严格地在受刑 混在一起像猪一样 Everyone else in the joint was doing real time mixed together living like pigs.

1237
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,710
可是我们单独生活 一切都由我们控制 But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1238
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:44,290
用球棒把那两个狗娘养的脸打烂了 认都认不出来 We batted them sons of bitches. You couldn't recognize them.

1239
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:45,790
太好了 活该 Good they deserved it.

1240
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,450
虽然有些警卫不受贿 但他们也不会告发我们 Even the hacks we couldn't bribe would never rat on the guys we did.

1241
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:51,390
这样才对 朋友邻居间应该互相尊重 ...had respect. People loved one another.

1242
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,590
夜不闭户 They left their doors open.

1243
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:53,760
抱歉 久等了 Sorry it took so long.

1244
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:56,430
那个瘦子警卫越来越令人讨厌了 The skinny guard's getting to be a real pain in the ass.

1245
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:59,800
- 是该给那个杂种一点教训了 - 我已经摆平了 - We're gonna have to do something. - I took care of him.

1246
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,670

1258
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:28,590
- 你别开玩笑了 - 你最好听我的 - You must be kidding. - Believe me.

1259
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,510

1275
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:56,580
我不能阻止别人来看我呀 I can't stop people from coming to see me.

1276
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,020
好呀 让她每星期替你偷运这些东西进来 Good let her sneak this stuff in for you every week.

- 让她每星期来和那些杂种警卫打交道 - 你这是干什么 - Let her fight these bastards every week! - Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1278
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,530

- 让她去做所有的事嘛 - 够了 - Let her do it! - Stop it!

1282
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,950
我好孤独 没有人要帮我 Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1283
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:30,910
贝儿和摩里都破产了 Belle and Morrie are broke.

1284
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,520
我向你的朋友利摩讨他欠你的钱 I asked your friend Remo for the money that he owes you.

1285
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:36,060
你知道他说什么吗 You know what he told me?

1286
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:39,820
他叫我把孩子们带到警察局去领救济金 He told me to take my kids down to the police station and get on welfare.

1287
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,970
一切会过去的 It's gonna be okay.

1288
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:46,270
就连保利 他出去后我也没见到他 我都没见到他们了 Even Paulie since he got out I've never seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1289
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,200
只有我们两个了 It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away.

1290
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:53,370
我告诉过你 一旦进了牢就孤立了 忘掉所有的人 忘掉保利 I told you that we're on our own. Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1291
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:58,370
他在保释期间是不会帮任何人做任何事的 As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1292
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,190
- 我受不了了 - 你能够忍受 听我说 - I can't do it. - Yes you can. Listen to me.

1293
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,850
你只要不断把东西带来 All I need is for you is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1294
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:08,620
这里有个从匹兹堡来的 他会帮我销货 I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll help me move it.

1295
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,520
一个月后我们就安定了 In a month we're gonna be fine.

1296
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,050
- 我们不需要别人 - 我害怕 - We won't need anybody. - I'm afraid.

1297
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:15,100
我怕万一保利知道你私下在贩毒 I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1298
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:16,720
我不是说了吗 不要担心保利 Don't worry about him.

1299
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:20,770
他并没有帮我们呀 他有没有供应食物给我们 He is not helping us out. Is he putting any food on the table?

1300
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,930
我们只有彼此帮助 We've gotta help each other.

1301
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,740
我们的行动一定要特别特别小心 We've just gotta be really careful while we do it.

1302
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,910
别让我再听到她的名字 I don't want to hear a word about her anymore.

1303
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:35,110
永远不会了 Never.

1304
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:40,720

1331
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,690
我了解吉米 你想我会像他那样冒险吗 I know Jimmy. You think I would take chances like him?

1332
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,600
汤米也是个好孩子 但他太疯了 Tommy's a good kid but he's crazy.

1333
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:36,500
他是个牛仔 他样样都想表现 He's a cowboy. He's got too much to prove.

1334
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,300
你不能不自己小心 You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1335
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,070
我太清楚他们的个性了 我只利用他们做些事 I know what they are. I only use them for certain things.

1336
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,770
我不要像盖比那样被人糟蹋 你明白吗 I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs you understand?

1337
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:48,280
盖比已经70岁了 他将老死狱中 那不是我所要的 Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1338
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:52,490

1339
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:55,550
就因为盖比手下的人 Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello to some fuck...

1340
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,820
在他背后贩毒 他被判20年 who was sneaking behind his back selling junk.

1341
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,430
我绝不容许这种事发生在我身上 你懂了吗 I don't need that. That won't happen to me understand?

1342
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,730
你能提早出来 是因为我给你找了份工作 You know you're out early because I got you a job.

1343
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,890
我不要整天被条子监视 明白吗 I don't need this heat you understand that?

1344
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:08,970
如果你看到任何人在贩毒 你一定要来告诉我 You see anybody fucking around with this shit you're gonna tell me right?

1345
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,170
不管是谁 That means anybody.

1346
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:11,330
对不对 All right.

1347
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:13,070
对 当然 Yeah. Of course.

1348
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:24,620
我花了一个星期明查暗访 才把那批匹兹堡货卖掉 Took me about a week of sneaking around before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1349
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:27,280
不过我着实赚了一大笔 But when I did it was a real score.

1350
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:29,950
我开始利用珊蒂的家来混合毒品 I started using Sandy's place to mix the stuff.

1351
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:32,560
虽然她吸的比她配的还多 And even with Sandy snorting more than she mixed...

1352
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:35,360
但还是利润极大的生意 I could see that this was a really good business.

1353
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,940
第二个礼拜我就赚了一万两千元 I made $12000 in my second week.

1354
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:41,600
为我的房子付了头期款 事情越来越顺利了 I had a down payment on my house and things were really rolling.

1355
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:46,010
我只要偶尔告诉珊蒂我爱她就好了 All I had to do was every once in a while tell Sandy that I loved her.

1356
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,680
这种安排太完美了 But it was perfect I'm telling you.

1357
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,220
只要货是从匹兹堡来的 As long as I kept getting the stuff from Pittsburgh...

1358
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:56,080
保利绝不可能发觉 I knew Paulie would never find out.

1359
01:28:56,260 --> 01:29:00,160
几个礼拜之后生意做大了 我一个人处理不了 Within a couple of weeks it got so big I needed some help.

1360
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:03,290
就把吉米和汤米拉了进来 So I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.

1361
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,220

1375
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:56,280

1378
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:04,480
这会让上次法国航空的劫案看起来像儿童故事 This'll make the Air France haul look like goddamn peanuts.

1379
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,920
- 小声点 - 你确定他会下手 对吗 - Come on. - He's gonna do it right?

然后再做决定 没有任何承诺 He's looking into it. We'll see what happens. No promises.

1382
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:16,130
我知道 你知道吗 那儿有好几百万 I know. Do you understand? There's millions in there. And I've been...

1383

1385
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:27,480
不用再为钱操心 我的好梦就要成真了 No more nut every week. No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1390
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,450
逼他开大门 and make him get us in the front door.

1391
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:48,000

摩里 喝一杯酒 然后闭嘴 Morrie have a drink and shut up.

1399
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:13,080
因为这次的劫案是他从中拉线的 Just because he set this up he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...

1400
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,780
摩里就以为他可以向吉米预支是理所当然的事 for an advance on the money we were going to steal.

1401
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:19,560
他并没有什么其他的意思 他就是这样的人 He didn't mean anything by it. That's just the way he was.

1402
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:30,540

我讨厌洗碗 弄坏我指甲 I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1421
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:34,000
我不管你讨不讨厌洗碗 你要放聪明点 How could you hate it? You got to be smart.

1422
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:37,300
就凭这些白粉 被抓到了我们就别想出来了 Look at all this powder around here. That could put us away forever.

1423
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,710
- 别这么紧张嘛 - 你想干什么 - Loosen up. - What are you doing?

01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:38,310
两天之内 一个买凯迪拉克 一个买貂皮大衣 In two days one guy gets a Caddy and one gets a $20000 mink.

1472
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:40,390
- 退回去 - 我会退回去 - Bring it fucking back. - I'll bring it back.

1473
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,050

1477
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:09,320
他醋劲好大 我不能看别人一眼 他会杀了我 He's so jealous. If I even look at anyone else he'll kill me.

1478
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,090

大家都在炫耀新东西 Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1488
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,880
显然他们都拿到钱了 我还在穿旧衣裳 Evidently they got their money. I'm wearing the same shit.

1513
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,550
每个人都得到一份可观的数目 这样其实就应该足够了 $6 million in cash. More than enough to go around.

1514
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,980
史达克 开门呀 Yo Stacks!

1524
01:38:57,050 --> 01:39:00,920
你老是迟到 连你自己的葬礼也会迟到 You're always fucking late. You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1525
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:09,830
有什么好看的 把咖啡带走吧 What the fuck you looking at? Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1526
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:14,870
我是开玩笑啦 操 What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1527
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:17,900
你还真要把咖啡带走 放下来啦 Put the fucking pot down. You gonna take the coffee?

1528
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:39,660
史达克总是疯疯癫癫的 Stacks was always crazy.

1529
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:43,660
他没有照计划把卡车处理掉 反而吸大麻吸嗨了 Instead of getting rid of the truck as he was supposed to he got stoned...

1530
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:48,360
跑去女朋友家 当他醒来 警察已经找到了卡车 went to his girlfriend's and by the time he woke up the cops had found the truck.

1531
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:50,630

已在车上找到指纹 They even said they came up with prints off the wheel.

1533
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:57,970
不用多久 他们就会找到史达克的 It was just a matter of time before they got to Stacks.

1534
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,520

- 史达克出了什么事 - 不要担心 - What happened with Stacks? - Don't worry about that.

1541
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:33,030
- 报上登出来了 - 他很担心 - It's in the papers. - He's worried.

1542
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:34,670
你在担心什么 What are you worried about?

1543
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:38,940
只是电视上 报上都有消息 The television and the newspapers. All the shit's out there.

汤米 Tommy.

1551
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:00,910
他们把名单打开了 保利得到批准把他正式加入名单 They opened up the books. Paulie got the okay.

1552
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:03,770

我做的计划 结果我什么也没得到 I mastermind the goddamn thing I'm left with dick.

1559
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:28,030
要不是我 他们就很辛苦 我要我的钱 They'd be up a creek if not for me. Fuck him! I want my money.

1560
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:30,460
我受够了 我要我的钱 I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1561
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,000
那个专门劫香烟的下流鬼 That cheap cigarette hijacker.

你是不是还要嚷嚷 You're gonna keep your mouth shut or what?

1564
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,980
你会拿到钱的 Morrie you're gonna get your money.

1565
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:47,640
但你不能老是这样烦人家 You just got to stop busting balls.

1570
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:55,150
我头一次看到吉米那么紧张 I could see for the first time that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1571
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:58,480
他同时朝八个方向去想 His mind was going in eight different directions at once.

1572
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:03,280
你想摩里有没有把什么事都告诉他太太 Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1573
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:04,930
摩里啊 Morrie? Him?

1574
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,370
那时候我就知道吉米要把摩里干掉 That's when I knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

1575
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:12,870
事情就是这样 一个人在几分钟之内就被决定了要被干掉 That's how it happens. That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1576
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,940
你知道他就是那种大嘴巴 He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1577
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:19,570
你看过他的电视广告 像只猪 Acts like a jerk in his commercials. Nobody listens to what he says.

1578
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:22,910
谁拿他的话当一回事 他整天说个不停 Nobody fucking cares what he says he talks so much.

1579
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:25,740
今天晚上把他带来 Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1580
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,550
- 知道吗 - 知道 - Okay? - All right.

1581
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:32,860
就这样开始 抱歉 我有没有弄到你眼睛 Start like this. Sorry. Did I get you in the eye?

1582
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:34,990
少惹我了好不好 Stop breaking my balls all right?

1583
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,030
我只是在拖时间 I was just stalling for time.

1584
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,860
希望在9点以前能说服吉米 I knew I still had till 8:00 or 9:00 to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1585
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:46,100
到现在为止 吉米还是认为我同意把摩里干掉 But meanwhile as far as Jimmy knew I was going along with the program.

1586
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:50,040
我把他头发拔出来了 我咬了他 他昏迷了 I pulled his hair out of his fucking head. I bit him. He's out cold.

1587
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,410
我气死了 我要杀了他 I'm enraged. I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1588
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:57,520
所以我先走开了 我们正要进去 I walk away. We start to go in the fucking joint.

1589
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,720
我不想转身 吉米对我这样 I don't want to turn around. Jimmy's going like this to me.

1590
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,420
我不想转身 I don't want to fucking turn around.

1591
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:07,750
我不想转身 他妈的 他抬头说 I don't want to turn around. He picks up his fucking head he says...

1592
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,890
我说 不要讲 I said "Don't say it."

1593
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:16,570
败类 "Jerkoff!"

1594
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:22,830
还能怎样 我就向他扑过去 What are you going to do? What? I fucking fly at him.

1595
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:25,980
我抓住他 开始捶他头 脸 I got him and I'm banging his head banging his fucking face.

1596
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:27,870
拔他头发 I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1597
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:31,040
我把他打得稀巴烂 I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1598
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:34,150
他躺着 浑身是血 我在喘气 He's laying there full of fucking blood. I'm out of breath.

1599
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,910
今晚就算了 今晚算了 Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1600
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,780
我心里的负担减轻了 It was a load off my mind.

1601
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:42,160
那个家伙 Poor bastard.

1602
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:44,490
还不知道自己有多危险 He never knew how close he'd come to getting killed.

1603
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:47,600
就算我告诉他 他差点没命 恐怕他也不会相信的 Even if I told him he would have never believed me.

1604
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:53,290
- 吉米 现在我能跟你谈谈吗 - 你这狗娘养的 你真够烦人 - Jimmy could I talk to you now? - You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1605
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:57,140
你要现在谈吗 好吧 我们来做个了断 Want to talk now? Okay let's talk. Let's get it over with.

1606
01:44:57,310 --> 01:45:00,300
从来没见过像你这么难缠的人 I've never met a ball buster like you my whole life.

1607
01:45:00,510 --> 01:45:02,480
谁比我还爱你 Who loves you more than I do?

1608
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:05,980
- 我会为你做任何事 - 除了不肯少来烦我 - I'd do anything for you. - Except to stop busting my balls.

1609
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:09,290
- 我们去喝咖啡吧 - 去餐厅还是别的地方 - Let's go have coffee. - Want to go to the diner?

1610
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:11,720
我们去大道上的餐厅 We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1611
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,360
- 哪一间呢 - 洛克威大道 24小时营业 - Which diner? - Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1612
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:17,620
- 有没有丹麦蛋糕 - 他们什么都有 - They got Danishes? - They got everything.

1613
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,090
我要带几个回去给贝儿 Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1614
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:22,600
你有没有听到我们在波士顿安排篮球赛放水的事 Hear about the points we were shaving up in Boston?

1615
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:24,900
那真是太棒了 It's terrific. Nunzio...

1616
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:34,670
我以为他永远也不会闭嘴 I thought he'd never shut up.

1617
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,540
没人比他更令人讨厌 What a pain in the ass.

1618
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,510
- 你要怎么处理他 - 把他分尸 丢掉 把车也丢掉 - What'll we do with him? - Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1619
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:41,620
然后打电话给我 Call me when you're through.

1620
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:44,220
- 法兰基 我们来把他大卸八块吧 - 好吧 - Frank let's chop him up. - All right.

1621
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:46,880
你要去哪里 你昏头啦 Where you going you dizzy motherfucker you?

1622
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:48,020
你不是说要把他解了吗 You said chop him up.

1623
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:51,630
不是在这里 去查理那儿 在这里怎么切 At Charlie's not here! Where are you gonna chop him here?

1624
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:55,260
你在做什么 快离开这里 Come on what are you doing? Get out of here.

1625
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:57,730
还不如让他开车 I got a better shot letting him drive.

1626
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,430
车引擎是冷的 The car's cold.

1627
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:03,170
热什么鬼车 快离开现场 Get the fuck out of here! What warm it up? Get out of here!

1628
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:06,500
- 是谁 - 是贝尔 开门 - Who is it? - It's Belle. Open up.

1629
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:08,340
是贝尔 让我进来 It's Belle. Let me in.

1630
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:13,020
摩里没有回家 他失踪了 我知道他一定出事了 Morris didn't come home. He's missing. I know something's happened.

1631
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:14,520
冷静一点 Calm down.

1632
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:17,250
他失踪了 我知道出事了 He's missing! I know something happened.

1633
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:19,620
他大概是喝醉了 倒在那里睡着了 He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.

1634
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:23,460
27年了 他从来没有在外过夜 而不打电话给我的 In 27 years he's never been away all night without calling.

1635
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:26,390
肯定出事了 你们一定晓得 I know something's happened. I know you know.

1636
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:30,190
我上楼去换衣服 先送你回家 然后去找他 Let me get changed. I'll take you home then look for him.

1637
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,870
- 我是从家里来的 我一直打电话 - 他在玩牌吧 - I've been home! I've been on the phone... - He's playing cards.

1638
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,570
- 你要我怎么跟贝尔讲 - 谁他妈在乎 - What'll I tell Belle? - Who gives a fuck?

1639
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:43,880
就说他跟野女人私奔了 关你什么事 Tell her he ran off with some broad. What do you care?

1640
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:46,210
- 你看 - 不要跟他们作对 - Watch this. - Don't fuck with them.

1641
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:48,410
就算坐一点牢 也总算捣了他们的蛋 I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.

1642
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:51,450
别给他们这个机会来得意了 Don't give them the satisfaction the fucks.

1643
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:56,060
走吧 我们去兜风 Come on fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1644
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,090
他们一夜没睡了 Keep them up all night.

1645
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,590
待会儿见 I'll see you later.

1646
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:54,410
吉米想把每一个能把他和劫案牵连在一起的人都除掉 Jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery...

1647
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:56,990
好在跟我一点关系都没有 but it had nothing to do with me.

1648
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,800
我给吉米一些可劫对象的消息 他则给我钱 I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money.

1649
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:14,940
之后我没再提大劫案的事 From then on I kept my mouth shut.

1650
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:18,980
我知道钱在吉米那里 I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his.

1651
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:22,480
他只拿一点钱孝敬保利而已 He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie but that was it.

1652
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,040
要他把钱分给有功劳的人 那是不可能的事 It made him sick to turn the money over to the guys who stole it.

1653
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:30,050
他宁愿把他们杀了 反正关我什么事 He'd rather whack them. Anyway what did I care?

1654
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,050
我也不想向吉米要求什么 I wasn't asking for anything.

1655
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:35,820
吉米倒从我的匹兹堡路线收获不少 And Jimmy was making nice money through my Pittsburgh connections.

1656
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,460
大劫案之后几个月 仍然到处发现死尸 Still months after the robbery they were finding bodies all over.

1657
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:05,220
当他们在冷冻车库里找到卡本的尸体 When they found Carbone in the meat truck...

1658
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:07,020
他已经冷冻得 he was frozen so stiff...

1659
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:10,320
要花两天才能解冻 才能拿出来解剖 it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1660
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:17,290
我从没见过吉米那么高兴 Still I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1661
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:21,300
他简直像个孩子 匹兹堡给我们带来钱财 He was like a kid. We had money coming in through my Pittsburgh people...

1662
01:49:21,470 --> 01:49:25,000
德航劫案的调查也渐渐冷却下来 and even after a while the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1663
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:27,540
那天早上令吉米高兴的原因 What made Jimmy so happy that morning...

1664
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:30,610
是因为汤米要被引荐 was that this was the day that Tommy was being made.

1665
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,910
他兴奋得好像他自己要被引荐似的 Jimmy was so excited you'd think he was being made.

1666
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,150
他至少打了四次电话到汤米家 He must have made four calls to Tommy's house.

1667
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:41,290
引荐礼完成之后以信号表示 They had a signal set up so he'd know the minute the ceremony was over.

1668
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,390
- 妈 你在哪儿 - 在这里呀 - Ma where are you? - Here I am.

1669
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:47,590
- 你回来啦 - 回来 我正要出去呀 - You're home. - Home? I'm leaving.

1670
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:50,630
- 不错吧 - 你看起来帅极了 - You look lovely. - I look good huh?

1671
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:54,140
千万小心 恭喜你了 祝你好运 You look wonderful. Be careful. Congratulations.

1672
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:58,140
我爱你 别再画宗教画了 拜托你 I love you. Don't paint any more religious pictures please.

1673
01:49:58,310 --> 01:49:59,900
- 上帝与你同在 - 再见 妈妈 - God be with you. - Bye Ma.

1674
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:02,410
我们都以好兄弟互相称呼 We always called each other goodfellas.

1675
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:04,210
你对某人说 You'd say to somebody:

1676
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:08,580
你会喜欢他 他是好兄弟 是我们一伙的 "You'll like this guy. He's all right. He's a goodfella one of us."

1677
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:10,320
你明白吗 You understand?

1678
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:13,320
我们都是好兄弟 We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1679
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:19,160
吉米和我都因为有爱尔兰血统 而不能被引荐 But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.

1680
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:21,820
即便我母亲是西西里人也没有用 It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1681
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:25,970
你一定要百分之百意大利血统才能被正式引荐 To become a member of a crew you've got to be 100% Italian...

1682
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:29,340
他们要能追踪出你所有亲戚的来历 so they can trace your relatives back to the old country.

1683
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,810
那是最高的荣誉 It's the highest honor they can give you.

1684
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:41,480
象征你已属于一个家庭 一个团体 It means you belong to a family and a crew.

1685
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:44,380
那意谓着再没有人敢伤害你 It means nobody can fuck around with you.

1686
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:47,320
你却可以任意欺侮 It also means you could fuck around with anybody...

1687
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:49,930
那些不属于任何家族的人 just as long as they aren't also a member.

1688
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,530
好像拥有偷劫的执照 做任何事的执照 It's like a license to steal. A license to do anything.

1689
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:57,690
你被正式引荐有多少年了 How many years ago since you were made?

1690
01:50:57,870 --> 01:51:00,600
- 我是老人了 30年前 - 30年前呀 - I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago. - Thirty years?

1691
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:02,510
是呀 有很多值得回忆的事呀 Brings back a lot of memories.

1692
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:05,040
派克山当时也只不过一粒青春痘嘛 Pike's Peak was a pimple then wasn't it?

1693
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:11,280
对吉米来说 汤米被引荐 As far as Jimmy was concerned with Tommy being made...

1694
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:13,850
就像我们都被引荐了一样 it was like we were all being made.

1695
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,250
我们之中有人当了会员了 We would now have one of our own as a member.

1696
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:34,870
- 是谁 - 是韦力 - Who's this? - This is Vinnie.

1697
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,840
怎么回事 仪式完成了吗 Vinnie. What happened? Did we get straightened out?

1698
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:41,040
发生一点问题 我们尽力了 No we had a problem. We tried to do everything we could.

1699
01:51:41,210 --> 01:51:42,200
你是什么意思 What do you mean?

1700
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:46,510
我是说他死了 我们也无能为力 You know what I mean. He's gone and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1701
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:50,290
- 就这样 - 你是什么意思 - That's it. - What do you mean?

1702
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,820
他死了 He's gone.

1703
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:54,820
就这样 That's it.

1704
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:02,530
我早就知道会这样 狗娘养的 我不能相信 I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1705
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:14,070
发生什么事啦 What happened?

1706
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,410
- 他们干掉他了 - 操 - They fucking whacked him - Fuck.

1707
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:33,890
你还好吗 Are you all right?

1708
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:43,460
那是替比利·贝兹报仇 It was revenge for Billy Batts...

1709
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:45,540
还有一些旧的积怨 and a lot of other things.

1710
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:46,700
就是这样 And that's that.

1711
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,280
我们是一点办法也没有 There was nothing we could do about it.

1712
01:52:49,450 --> 01:52:52,040
贝兹是黑手党的 汤米还不是 Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.

1713
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:54,590
我们只是老老实实的逆来顺受 We had to sit still and take it.

1714
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:58,190
意大利人圈子就是这样 一种毫无道理的规定 It was among the Italians. It was real greaseball shit.

1715
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,670
他们甚至打在汤米脸上 They even shot Tommy in the face...

1716
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:16,300
让他妈妈不能给他开棺瞻仰 so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.

1717
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:29,910
1980年5月11日 星期日 上午6点55分

1718
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:05,620
我本来预备好要忙一整天的 I was gonna be busy all day. I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...

1719
01:54:05,790 --> 01:54:09,060
我要拿枪去给吉米配消音器 to match some silencers he had.

1720
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:12,190
去医院接我弟弟 带他回家吃晚饭 I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him home.

1721
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:14,860
然后去取匹兹堡来的货 I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...

1722
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:18,200
交给露易丝 让她将货空运给亚特兰大附近的客人 to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.

1723
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:32,940
我马上就知道他不会要那些枪 我知道我的钱泡汤了 Right away I knew he didn't want them and I'd be stuck for the money.

1724
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:36,820
因为他要我才买的 现在他又不要了 I only bought them because he wanted them and now he didn't.

1725
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:41,010
这些有什么鬼用 一个都配不上 你在搞什么 What good are these? None of them fit. What's the matter with you?

1726
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:42,520
我才不付钱呢 I'm not paying for it.

1727
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:46,360
我一句话也没讲 吉米气得连再见都没说 I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed off he didn't even say goodbye.

1728
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:48,970
别再吸毒了 你的脑子都快不管用了 Stop the drugs. They're making your mind into mush!

1729
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:50,930
- 听见没有 - 我把它们带回去就是了 - You hear me? - I'll take them back.

露易丝 你知道我们所做的事有多严重吗 Lois do you understand what we are involved in here?

1850
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:44,170
我管不了那么多 没有帽子 我就不上飞机 I don't care. I need my hat. I won't fly without it.

1851
02:02:49,110 --> 02:02:53,280

刹那之间 我以为我已经死了 For a second I thought I was dead.

1858
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:22,180
但当我听到吵杂声 我知道那些是警察 But when I heard all the noise I knew they were cops.

1859
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:23,910

02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:29,040
如果是帮派兄弟 我会连一点声音都听不见 If they had been wiseguys I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1862
02:03:29,950 --> 02:03:31,550
就被打死了 I would have been dead.

1863
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:34,020
麦可 把门锁上 Michael lock the door!

1864
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:58,410
余波

1865
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:01,210
你最后一次被捕是什么时候 Talk to me. When was the last time you took a collar?

1866
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:03,250
说呀 Fuckhead I'm talking to you.

1867
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:07,080
你一个字也不肯说 你什么也不用说 我不在乎 You don't want to say a fucking word don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1868
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:11,350
等你要被关25年的时候 看你还能对你朋友多忠心 You'll do 25 years. See how much of a good guy you'll be then.

1869
02:04:11,530 --> 02:04:13,550
我一直以为直升机上的人 All day I thought the guys in the helicopter...

1870
02:04:13,730 --> 02:04:18,330
是为了德航劫案在跟踪我 原来他们是缉毒组的 were local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1871
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:19,490
把律师叫来就好了 Just get the lawyer.

1872
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:23,230
他们盯了我一个月了 窃听电话 跟踪行程 全套都来 They'd been on me a month. Phone taps surveillance everything.

1873
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:26,070
你认识这些伙计 你的搭档都被抓了 You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1874
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,180
你要是不说 我会整晚像苍蝇一样叮咬你 You don't want to talk to me you'll have a problem all night.

1875
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:33,880
在纽约 这任何一项罪名都可以判你25年监禁 Each one of these counts holds 25-to-life in New York State.

1876
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:38,610
25年呀 老兄 你身心都会受不了那种压力的 Twenty-five fucking years pal. I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1877
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:41,650
你们去哪儿 买杂货呀 What were you guys grocery shopping?

1878
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:46,900
要做蛋糕呀 你也要做蛋糕呀 Are we going to make a cake? You going to make a fucking cake?

1879
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:49,290
有没有找到什么好东西呀 You got anything good in there?

1880
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:52,060
是不是白粉呀 Is it good?

1881
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:58,730
再见啦 鸟蛋 Bye-bye dickhead.

1882
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:03,610
阿迪卡监狱见啦 See you in Attica dick.

1883
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,110
我跟吉米谈过了 他愿意给我一点钱 I spoke to Jimmy. He offered to give me some money.

1884
02:05:07,690 --> 02:05:10,920
他想知道发生什么事了 他要跟你谈谈 He just wants to know what's happening. He just wants to talk to you.

1885
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:12,520
去他的吉米 去他的钱 Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1886
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:15,890
我一定得想办法出去 把事情向保利摆平 否则我死定了 I got to straighten out everything with Paulie or I'm dead.

1887
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:18,420
那也许你在里面还安全点 Then you're better off staying in here.

1888
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:22,160
他们在里面一样可以干掉我 也许还更容易 They could whack me in here as easy as outside maybe even easier.

1889
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:23,960
他们都担心我会把事情抖出来 They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1890
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:26,240
他们已经在避我了 我在里面迟早是死路一条 People are already walking away from me. I'm dead in here.

1891
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,970
你一定要把我弄出去 You got to get me out.

1892
02:05:28,570 --> 02:05:33,170
凯伦终于让她妈妈拿房子抵押 保我出来 Karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and I was out.

1893
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:37,440
我有种感觉 我一出监牢就会被杀 I remember I had this feeling I would be killed right outside the jail.

1894
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:41,050
我知道保利还在生我的气 他那种死脾气的人 I knew Paulie was still pissed at me and he's such a hothead.

1895
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,950
我也替吉米担心 And I was worried about Jimmy.

1896
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:47,420
吉米自己也很清楚状况 如果保利知道他跟我在搞贩毒 See Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was into drug deals with me...

1897
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:51,150
他会比我还先死 Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me.

1898
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:54,490
情势对我很不利 This is the bad time.

1899
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:57,630
到家之后我才有点安全感 I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1900
02:05:59,470 --> 02:06:03,240
现在我要好好计划保住性命 尽快把货脱手 Now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope...

1901
02:06:03,410 --> 02:06:07,970
躲起来一阵子 让我慢慢把所有事情摆平 the cops never found then disappear until I can get things straightened out.

1902
02:06:09,610 --> 02:06:10,600
操 Fuck!

1903
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:14,510
- 凯伦 我藏起来的那批货呢 - 我冲下马桶了 - Where's the stuff I left Karen? - I flushed it down the toilet.

1904
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:17,280
你干了什么 You what?

1905
02:06:17,890 --> 02:06:20,410
我该怎么办 到处都是条子 What was I supposed to do? They were all over the house.

1906
02:06:20,590 --> 02:06:24,650
那是我们的全部财产 价值6万块 我需要那些钱 That was worth $60000! I need that money! That's all we got!

1907
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:27,490
我能怎么办 他们有搜查令 What was I supposed to do? They had a search warrant!

1908
02:06:27,670 --> 02:06:32,100
你为什么要这么做 我们只有那些钱 That's all the money we had! I was depending on that! Why did you do that?

1909
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:35,440
我没办法 他们一定会找到的 I had to. They were going to find it!

1910
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:39,570
- 他们绝不会找到的 - 我敢发誓 - They would have never found it! - They would have I swear to you!

1911
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:42,670
他们一定会找到的 They would've found it!

1912
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:45,550
你为什么要这样做 Why did you do that?

1913
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:49,280
- 他们一定会找到的 - 你为什么要这样做 - They would have found it. - Why did you do that Karen?

1914
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,460
我的天呀 Oh my God!

1915
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,860
- 我是迫不得已 - 我的天呀 - I had to do it. - Oh my God.

1916
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,930
保利 我真的很抱歉 Paulie I'm really sorry.

1917
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:39,700
我不知道该说什么才好 我知道我犯了严重的错误 I don't know what else to say. I know I fucked up.

1918
02:07:39,870 --> 02:07:41,360
你搞砸了 Yeah you fucked up.

1919
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,780
但我现在没事了 But I'm all right now.

1920
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:52,720
你可以相信我 我拿我孩子做保证 I can be trusted now. I'm clean. On my kids I'm clean.

1921
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:55,080
你睁着眼对我说谎 You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1922
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:58,510
把我当冤大头 You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1923
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:00,610
毫无分量 Like I was never nothing to you.

1924
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:03,660
你警告过我们 所以我更不敢向你说实话了 After what you said I couldn't come to you.

1925
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,160
我从那时起到现在 You know I was ashamed.

1926
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:12,170
都很惭愧 I'm ashamed now.

1927
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:17,700
但是我已经走投无路了 保利 But I got nowhere else to go Paulie.

1928
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:25,210
我现在只有求你了 我真的需要你的帮助 You're all I've got. And I really need your help. I really do.

1929
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:32,480
拿着 Take this.

1930
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:49,670
从现在起我不认识你了 And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1931
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,750
三千两百块 $3200.

1932
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:06,310
一生替他做事 他就给了我三千两百块 That's what he gave me. $3200 for a lifetime.

1933
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:09,450
连买棺材都不够 It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.

1934
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:11,690
- 我们得跑路了 - 我不想跑 - We got to get out. - I don't want to run.

1935
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:16,230
难道你要我放弃一切 找地方躲起来吗 I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything? Go hiding?

1936
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:19,160
我不要 那就是你所要的生活吗 I don't want to do that. Is that what you want?

1937
02:09:19,340 --> 02:09:21,500
我们留在这里 我们就死定了 If we stay around here we're dead.

1938
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:24,100
死定了 懂不懂 You got it? We're dead.

1939
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:25,730
他们说得没错 They're right.

1940
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:29,310
你药嗑太多了 你已经完全神经过敏了 You took too much of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

1941
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:34,710
他还好吧 有没有找他麻烦 How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1942
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:35,870
他还好 He's okay.

1943
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:38,350
他把嗑药的毛病改掉了 They sobered him up.

1944
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:40,720
那就好 Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1945
02:09:44,930 --> 02:09:47,230
他有没有告诉你 条子问了他一些什么样的问题 You know what kind of questions they're asking him?

1946
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:48,990
吉米 我不知道 Jimmy I don't know.

1947
02:09:50,070 --> 02:09:53,590
我心情太乱了 我又没有钱 I got my mind on so many other things. I got no money...

1948
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:56,770
孩子们都已经会看报纸了 The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.

1949
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:58,970
你回去叫他马上给我打电话 Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1950
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:03,470
我们要好好处理这件事 这是非常重要的 As soon as you talk to him he's got to call me. It's important.

1951
02:10:03,810 --> 02:10:07,410
他不知道我来找你 他现在不是很正常 He doesn't know I came here to see you. It's like he's crazy.

1952
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:10,650
- 先拿去救急 有几千块钱 - 谢了 吉米 - Take this. It's a couple of thousands. - Thanks Jimmy.

1953
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:12,820
不要太担心好吗 一切都会过去的 Don't worry everything will be all right.

1954
02:10:12,990 --> 02:10:16,290
我有一批很漂亮的迪奥女裙 I got some beautiful Dior dresses. You want to have them?

1955
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:18,430
去挑几件喜欢的吧 Pick out a few for yourself.

1956
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:20,890
- 挑给我妈妈 - 可以 没问题 随便挑 - For my mom. - Yeah whatever.

1957

不 不 是在转角仓库 No. It's over here. In the store on the corner.

1958
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:26,570
因为是赃物 我放在角落 It's swag so I got it down on the corner.

1959
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:34,030
去吧 甜心 再见 Go ahead sweetheart I'll see you.

1960

- 这边吗 - 一直走 - Over here? - Right down there.

1963
02:10:58,870 --> 02:11:00,530
一直走 在转角 It's over there on the corner.

1964
02:11:01,210 --> 02:11:02,470
就在那里 Right there.

02:11:36,670 --> 02:11:38,800
不是 去呀 就在里面 No go ahead. It's right in there.

1966
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:41,070
不用了 吉米 我在赶时间 No Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1967
02:11:41,410 --> 02:11:44,210
我妈在看孩子 我得回去 My mom's watching the kids! I got to get home!

1968
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:45,870

1969
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:09,970
凯伦 Karen!

1970
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,500
发生什么事了 What happened?

1971
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,940
没事 Nothing.

1972
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:20,450
- 到底什么事 - 我只是突然怕起来了 - What happened? - I just got scared.

1973
02:12:23,950 --> 02:12:25,080
车钥匙拿了没有 Got the keys?

1974
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:30,490
- 到底什么事 - 我只是害怕起来了 - What happened Karen? - I just got scared. It's okay.

1975
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:32,250
- 没事吧 - 现在没事了 - Are you all right? - Yeah.

1976
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:43,730
如果你是黑手党员 你永远不会知道几时会被杀 If you're part of a crew nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.

1977
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:46,040
没人会事先通知你的 It doesn't happen that way.

1978
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:49,650
也不像电影里先大吵大骂 There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.

1979
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:53,880
来杀你的人面带笑容 像是你很亲近的朋友 Your murderers come with smiles. They come as your friends.

1980
02:12:54,050 --> 02:12:56,080
他们一直很关心你 People who cared for you all your life.

1981
02:12:56,250 --> 02:13:00,620
在你有困难时 他们总会来帮助你 They always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help.

1982
02:13:00,990 --> 02:13:04,220
所以我跟吉米约好在人多的地方见面 So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.

1983
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:08,590
我早到了15分钟 可吉米已经比我先到了 I got there 15 minutes early and Jimmy was already there.

1984
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:13,440
他占了靠窗的雅座 凡是来餐厅的人 他都看得见 He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up.

1985
02:13:13,770 --> 02:13:16,140
他要确认我没有被跟踪 He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1986
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:19,440
他很紧张 什么也没吃 He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1987
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:23,500
表面看来一点也没事 On the surface everything was supposed to be fine.

1988
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:26,010
我们应该是要商量我的案子 We were supposed to be discussing my case.

1989
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:31,120
但我可以感觉到吉米在试探我是否会为了救自己而出卖他 But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1990
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:36,520
我一直提醒你 不要在电话上谈事情 I been telling you your whole life don't talk on the phone.

1991
02:13:36,730 --> 02:13:38,520
现在你明白了 Now you understand?

1992
02:13:41,170 --> 02:13:44,500
我想你胜诉的机会很大 一切会没问题的 It's going to be okay. You got a good chance to beat the case.

1993
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:51,940
那个小子 你知道我是在说谁吧 You know that kid from the city we were talking about? You know?

1994
02:13:54,350 --> 02:13:58,580
那是个告密者 他一被捕就把所有的人都招供出来了 The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as he got pinched he ratted on everybody.

1995
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:03,290
我知道他现在躲在哪里 I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1996
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:06,550
懂不懂我说的 Know what I'm saying?

1997
02:14:11,530 --> 02:14:14,690
你想你能和安东尼一方面度假 一方面把他解决掉吗 Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?

1998
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:18,860
没问题 No not at all.

1999
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:22,260
这样他们就没证人了 That way they got nothing.

2000
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:33,850
吉米从来没有叫我替他除掉任何人 Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.

2001
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:37,980
现在他叫我和安东尼一起到佛罗里达去为他杀人 But now he's asking me to go to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.

2002
02:14:45,530 --> 02:14:48,860
那时候我就知道 如果我去了佛州 我不会活着回来 That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.

2003
02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:06,550
不论你要把我们搬去哪里 我说过 Whenever you move me I asked once and I'll tell you again...

2004
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,550
我不去寒冷的地方 I don't want to go any place cold.

2005
02:15:09,550 --> 02:15:11,710
你并没有选择余地 You don't have a choice in that matter.

2006
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:14,650
到底是谁管这个 Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

2007
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:18,090
帮个忙 只要不是寒冷地方就行 just no place cold. Do that for me. I'm trying to...

2008
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:19,990
他有气管炎 He's bronchial that's why.

2009
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:22,720
如果检查后他真有气管炎 我们会列入考虑因素 If he's legitimately bronchial we'll consider that.

2010
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:25,100
我希望去不冷的地方 I'd like to go someplace not cold.

2011
02:15:25,270 --> 02:15:29,000
我能问一些问题吗 我父母会怎么样 Can I ask you some questions? What about my parents?

2012
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:31,100
他们怎么啦 What about them?

2013
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:33,770
我能不能见他们 跟他们通消息 Am I going to see them? Am I going to talk to them?

2014
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:37,410
怎么跟他们联络 Don't I have some kind of contact with them?

2015
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:39,110
不能 No.

2016
02:15:40,250 --> 02:15:43,580
等一等 你是说 Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that...

2017
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:47,980
就算我父母生病了 我也不能去看他们吗 God forbid something happens to my parents they get sick I can't see them?

2018
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:51,150
也许可以特别安排 如果他们病了 Maybe something can be worked out if they're sick...

2019
02:15:51,630 --> 02:15:53,790
情形特殊的话 if there's extraordinary circumstances...

2020
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:56,830
我不能这样做 亨利 I can't do this. I can't do this Henry.

2021
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:59,700
我不能留下我父母不管 I can't leave my parents.

2022
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:03,130
抱歉 凯伦 我跟你说了 Excuse me Karen I told you before.

2023
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:07,400
除非你跟孩子们和我在一起 我不会同意这个证人保护行动 I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.

2024
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:11,410
我没有办法一个人捱过这些 I can't do it without you.

2025
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:15,910
你要怎么做就怎么做 可是 就这样 So you do whatever but... that's it.

2026
02:16:17,450 --> 02:16:19,980
- 你们需要亨利 并不需要我 对不对 - 没错 - You need Henry not me right? - That's right.

2027
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:22,790
老实说 我并不在乎你去不去 Frankly I don't care whether you go or not.

2028
02:16:23,090 --> 02:16:26,360
如果能使他成为一个快乐而有用的证人 我希望你去 If it'll make him a better witness I'd like you to be with him.

2029
02:16:26,530 --> 02:16:28,230
他们要的是亨利 不是我 They want Henry not me.

2030
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:31,460
亨利会受到保护 他们动不了他 Henry'll be in the protection program. They can't get to him.

2031
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:35,840
他们只能从你跟孩子身上动手来伤害亨利 They can only get to him by getting to you or your kids.

2032
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:38,410
假如他参与这次行动 你的处境就很危险 If he goes into the program you're in danger...

2033
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:41,010
- 我什么也不知道呀 - 不要给我 - I don't know anything. - Don't give me...

2034
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:42,540
天真无邪那一套 the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2035
02:16:42,710 --> 02:16:47,280
我听过那些电话录音 你在电话中大谈白粉 I've listened to those wiretaps and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2036
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:50,650
你跟亨利一通电话接着一通 Conversation after conversation you talked to Henry on the phone.

2037
02:16:55,930 --> 02:16:57,950
不管他是进监牢 It doesn't matter. Whether he goes to jail...

2038
02:16:58,130 --> 02:17:01,430
还是胜诉了 他都一样是没命 or stays on the streets and beats the case he's a dead man.

2039
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:03,900
你们心里都很清楚 He knows it and you know it.

2040
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:07,160
我们的孩子怎么办 他们要上学呀 What about the kids and school?

2041
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,600
总不能把他们留下 Will they get left back? I mean what goes on?

2042
02:17:10,010 --> 02:17:12,500
你们为什么不到华尔街去抓那些真正的坏人 Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2043
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:15,440
卖西装给你们的人 真有幽默感 Whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor.

2044
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:18,450
归根结底 和我们配合才是唯一救你们的方法 What it comes down to is we're your only salvation.

2045
02:17:19,150 --> 02:17:22,590
我们会保障你们的生命 也会不让他去坐牢 We'll save your life and his life and we'll keep you out of jail.

2046
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:29,660
今天早上你曾把你的背景向陪审团说明 This morning you told the jury about your background.

2047
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:31,660
要从人群中消失并不是一件困难的事 It was easy for us to disappear.

2048
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,120
房子是岳母的名字 My house was in my mother-in-law's name.

2049
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:36,270
车是我老婆的名字 My cars were registered to my wife.

2050
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:39,870
社会福利卡以及驾照都是假的 My Social Security cards and driver's licenses were phonies.

2051
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:42,400
没投过票 没缴过税 I never voted or paid taxes.

2052
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:47,430
唯一能表示有我这个人存在的是出生证明和犯罪记录 My birth certificate and arrest sheet was all you'd ever have to know I was alive.

2053
02:17:47,610 --> 02:17:50,140
- 那个人在法庭内吗 - 是的 - Do you see him here in this courtroom? - Yes.

2054
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:52,880
你能为陪审团将他指证出来吗 Will you please point him out for the jury?

2055
02:17:55,590 --> 02:18:00,180
法官大人 请记录下来 希尔先生已正式指证了詹姆斯·康威 Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill identified the defendant James Conway.

2056
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:04,420
你也认识一位叫保罗·西席罗的人 Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?

2057
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:06,750
- 那个人在这个法庭内吗 - 是的 - Do you see him in the courtroom? - Yes.

2058

2060
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:18,340
法官大人 我这里有一份文件 Your Honor I have a document...

2061
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:20,910
对我来说 最困难的就是从那种生活方式中走出来 The hardest thing was leaving the life.

2062
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:23,200
我还是喜爱那种生活 I still love the life.

2063
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:25,710
我们像电影明星一样被礼遇 We were treated like movie stars with muscle.

2064
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:27,940
只要开口 要什么有什么 We had it all just for the asking.

2065
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:31,450
老婆 母亲 孩子 人人都能享受 Our wives mothers kids everybody rode along.

2066
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,920
一包纸袋的珠宝藏在厨房 I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.

2067
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:37,360
一缸白粉就放在床边 I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.

2068
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:41,330
称为鼠辈 是因为老鼠为了求生存 什么事都会做 People call them rats because rats do anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2069
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:43,520
- 抗议 - 抗议成立 - Objection! - Objection sustained.

2070
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:46,900
- 至于老鼠我就不知道了 - 你太了解了 - I know nothing about being a rat. - You know everything about it.

2071
02:18:49,110 --> 02:18:51,600
只要一通电话 什么都有 Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

2072
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:55,210
免费的汽车 城里所有的黑帮分子玩乐的地方都能自由进出 Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.

2073
02:18:55,380 --> 02:18:57,870
一个周末可以下注两三万 I'd bet $20000 $30000 over a weekend...

2074
02:18:58,050 --> 02:19:02,210
也可以一周内把赢的钱全花光 有时候也借高利贷来还赌债 then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.

2075
02:19:02,390 --> 02:19:03,440
不过一点关系都没有 It didn't matter.

2076
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:09,020
钱花光了 我只要出去多抢一点就行了 It didn't mean anything. When I was broke I would go out and rob some more.

2077
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:10,830
我们控制一切 We ran everything.

2078
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:15,630
收买条子 收买律师 甚至收买法官 We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers. We paid off judges.

2079
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:19,340
每个人都受贿 只要我们肯出钱 Everybody had their hands out. Everything was for the taking.

2080
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:22,930
现在都结束了 And now it's all over.

2081
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:25,310
难就难在这里 That's the hardest part.

2082
02:19:26,340 --> 02:19:27,940
如今一切都不同了 Today everything is different.

2083
02:19:28,110 --> 02:19:32,280
我得像其他人一样等排班 There's no action. I have to wait around like everyone else.

2084
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:34,450
连像样的菜都吃不到 Can't even get decent food.

2085
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:38,350
我搬来以后曾点过意大利面 加意大利蕃茄配料 After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce...

2086
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:40,320
结果上的是鸡蛋面加蕃茄酱 and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2087
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:42,680
我成为了无名小卒淡泊一生 I'm an average nobody.

2088
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:46,830
下半辈子得过得像个可怜虫 I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.

2089
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:06,100
