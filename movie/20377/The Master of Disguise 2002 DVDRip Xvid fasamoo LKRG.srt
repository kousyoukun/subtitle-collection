1
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,515
Many centuries ago...

2
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,159
...a remarkable family
began to practice...

3
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,159
...the magical art of disguise.

4
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,765
Down through the ages
they worked in secret...

5
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,061
...protecting the world from evil.

6
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,034
This is their story.

7
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,786
Well, stop her!.

8
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,600
This is my son.

9
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,403
Most people thought he sold
vacuum cleaners door to door.

10
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,235
But as you can see,
there was more to the story.

11
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,306
Where do you think you're going?

12
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,423
Idiot.

13
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,236
This is a mistake.
That woman is not Bo Derek!

14
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,534
That was close.

15
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,948
Too close.

16
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,351
I demand to speak
to the American Embassy!

17
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,351
Frabbrizio, it's time your son
is told of his destiny.

18
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,326
This is no life for my son.

19
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:03,433
I will never tell him
of his true destiny.

20
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:19,008
Frabbrizio decided to keep the family
legacy a secret from his son.

21
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,484
The boy never knew the truth
about his urge to disguise himself...

22
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,488
... with anything he could find.

23
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,389
Pistachio, I hope
you're not making faces...

24
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,655
...in the mirror with the underwear
on the head.

25
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,095
That would be crazy, Papa.

26
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:40,305
Unless I had the shaving-cream beard
to go along with it.

27
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:46,206
This is my grandson Pistachio.
He has always been a little different.

28
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,181
From the beginning,
he had impulses he couldn't control.

29
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,616
You slap me, I slap you.

30
00:05:55,888 --> 00:06:00,188
As Pistachio grew up, he couldn't help
mimicking people around him.

31
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,692
Add the copper sulfate.

32
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,194
Add the copper sulfate.

33
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,995
Add just a little bit of luminol.

34
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,503
Add just a little bit of luminol.

35
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:25,145
But he always had
a hard time fitting in.

36
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,244
You think you got muscles now?
Try this.

37
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,548
Okay.

38
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,056
Why does he have underwear
on his head?

39
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,167
What he didn't know was that
his true adventure was about to begin.

40
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,797
There's a young lady out here
to see you.

41
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,669
For me? Fantastico!

42
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,605
Yes! Yes!

43
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,446
A young lady.

44
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,409
Hey, amico!

45
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,184
There's a girl waiting for me!

46
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,412
Mama!

47
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:08,993
Ask your nice lady friend to come in,
and I'll make you corned beef ravioli.

48
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,629
What a grand idea, Mama!

49
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,225
Oh, my sonny-son, handsome son.
Go, go, go.

50
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,206
Naturally, Pistachio wanted
to find a girl just like Mama.

51
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,753
Sophia. What an unexpected
surprise, love-cake.

52
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,315
-"Love-cake"?
-I so enjoyed meeting you last evening.

53
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:44,519
I know we had some laughs at the bar
last night, but you're not my type.

54
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:49,224
Besides, I have a boyfriend.
So don't call me, okay? I gotta go.

55
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,035
Yes.

56
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:56,235
Something about her
reminds me of my mama.

57
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,512
Oh, yes. She will be a great cook.

58
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,981
Papa.

59
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,250
I straighten the menu.

60
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,829
I'm okay. I'm okay.

61
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,359
Excuse, young man.

62
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:26,300
I notice that you became acquainted
with the sidewalk a moment ago.

63
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,064
I'm not a sports kid.

64
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,176
Pistachio, do one of your funny voices
and cheer the kid up.

65
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,814
What an excellent idea, Bernardo.
Yes, yes.

66
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:40,008
I do for you now a scene
from the hit motion picture Shrek.

67
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,550
You ready? Okay.

68
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,148
Why don't you get away
from me, Donkey?

69
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:50,694
What you talking about, "Get away
from you"? I'm making waffles.

70
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,496
Oh, what a cute little puppy.

71
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:02,664
I see you like my dog.
His name is The Cuteness.

72
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,172
I never had a dog.

73
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,437
Well, perhaps your papa
will buy you a dog.

74
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,438
I never had a dad.

75
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,950
Papa deficient, yes.

76
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,949
You can play with The Cuteness
any time you want.

77
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,623
Let me introduce myself.
My name's Pistachio Disguisey.

78
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,197
-My name's Barney Baker.
-A pleasure, Barney Baker.

79
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,461
And now, hungry patrons.

80
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,069
Arrivederci!

81
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,088
Moron, use a tray next time.
Those are too many plates.

82
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,786
Ah, the new waiter, Rex.

83
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,756
So cute in your inexperience.

84
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,369
Watch and learn, my friend.

85
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,648
Yes, I clean. I clean.

86
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,880
Goodbye, gooey sauce.

87
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:30,794
Cheese? Yes, I give you cheese.
Yes, nice cheese. Yes, cheese.

88
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,988
You like, huh? Oh, yes.

89
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,763
Papa.

90
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,602
And finally, we have fresh,
bouncing baby shrimp.

91
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,277
I'll just take the spaghetti.

92
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:51,917
And do me a favor, buddy.
Get me some man-sized meatballs.

93
00:10:56,055 --> 00:11:00,355
Am I going too fast for you?

94
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:05,925
Am I going too fast for you?

95
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,428
-You mocking him?
-You mocking him?

96
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,662
-You better not be.
-You better not be.

97
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,300
-Pistachio, stop it. No mocking.
-Pistachio, stop it. No mocking.

98
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,209
Why do you let
that little nutball be a waiter?

99
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:28,148
Listen. You have a problem with my son,
then you have a problem with me.

100
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,223
You are not welcome here.
You, and you, get out!

101
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,760
Pistachio, what did I tell you?

102
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,864
Yes, I know, Papa. I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

103
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,831
-The mocking's getting worse.
-Nonsense.

104
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,769
There's so many voices in my head
I don't know who I am.

105
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:52,239
Listen. You are Pistachio Disguisey,
and you're a great waiter.

106
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,539
That is one of the voices.
Not the loudest one--

107
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,276
No. You are my son, you understand?

108
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:04,354
And I will always be proud of you.

109
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,256
-We should have gone to Burger King.
-Perhaps my destiny is far away.

110
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:13,694
No, my son.
Your destiny is here, okay?

111
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,096
Yes, destiny is here.

112
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:21,103
But, Papa, don't preach. I'm in
trouble deep, and I'm keeping my baby.

113
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,009
-You're what?
-What?

114
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,753
Excuse, waiter Rex. What are you doing
with your arm around the cake?

115
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,487
The tush queen, what are you doing
out here with the oversized Rex?

116
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,155
Look, Pistachios, the silly voices,
the making faces...

117
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,599
-...it was fun for one second, okay?
-Only one second?

118
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,332
I never wanted to go out with youse!
I love Rex.

119
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,803
Yeah, got it?

120
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,541
I see. I can take a hint.

121
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:07,579
The message is coming through
loud and clear.

122
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,351
-I gotta get back to work, baby.
-Okay.

123
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,649
Goodbye, Pistachios.

124
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,171
Get in the car, huh?

125
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:35,079
Oh, my little cannoli.
You'll make my Pistachio very happy.

126
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,013
Get in the car now!
Get him in there!

127
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,352
Let's go!

128
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:49,956
Ransacked!

129
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,962
Hello? Police? In my home,
it is full of ransackery.

130
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,191
Everything different. Where--?

131
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,337
My name is Pistachio.
Mama's cannoli is here.

132
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,699
Don't call again.

133
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,898
Mama! Papa!

134
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,579
Heavenly Father, show me a sign.
I promise I'll never mock you again.

135
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,205
My family is missing,
and I don't know what to do.

136
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:18,414
I don't know what to do. I don't know
what to do. I don't know....

137
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,241
Can I help you?

138
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,713
-I came to help you, Pistachio.
-Help me what?

139
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,945
Find your mother
and your father. My son.

140
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,945
My father...

141
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,090
...your son.

142
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,750
Holy cannoli, you are my sister.

143
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,693
You don't have a sister, pea brain.
I'm your grandfather.

144
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,892
Yes, that was my next choice.

145
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,163
It's been 23 years.
How did you know I needed help?

146
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:13,868
That and more will be revealed shortly.
But for now, let me in. I hunger.

147
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,815
So I come down from the rooftop.
I come home.

148
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,248
And there's no Mama, no Papa,
just ransackery.

149
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,588
-Did you ask Jeeves?
-Yes, but no such luck.

150
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,195
On the roof, did you hear something
that sounded like this..

151
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,564
Yes, exactly that!

152
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,792
But without the pain on my face.

153
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,266
We have a clue!

154
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,113
Grandpapa?

155
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,985
-I'm looking for my grandfather.
-Grandfather not here.

156
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,352
I'm sorry.

157
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,120
It's me, you idiot!

158
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,292
Amazing. You sound like Grandfather.

159
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,726
Fool! I am your grandfather.

160
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,857
I don't....

161
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,335
Latex rubber.

162
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,103
Yes. It's so soft.

163
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,113
Like a soft, fat baby-bottom face.

164
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,041
This is nothing. I'm rusty!

165
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:32,280
When I'm on the top of my game,
my disguise is seamless!

166
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,457
Yes, without the seams.

167
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,062
And the place is so incredibly clean.

168
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,165
So tidy.

169
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,866
Bravo, Grandpa!

170
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:50,201
Put a clamp on your pastry hole.
I'll give it to you straight.

171
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,836
-You are a Disguisey.
-Yes, Pistachio Disguisey.

172
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,346
I'm begging you,
curb your yammering skull cave!

173
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,985
Now, throughout history...

174
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:05,021
...the Disguiseys used their skills
as Masters of Disguise...

175
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,057
...for the betterment of mankind.

176
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:12,220
In Europe, they used their power
to catch thieves.

177
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,561
Now I've got it. It's mine.

178
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,725
The statue is alive!

179
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,104
They were the world's
first environmentalists.

180
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:25,504
Sorry, George Washington,
no cherry tree for you.

181
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,412
Abraham Lincoln
was such a boring speaker...

182
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:35,516
...that the Disguiseys had to help him
get elected president.

183
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,619
If you'll excuse me,
I just need a drink of water.

184
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,520
Rough crowd.

185
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,960
Let's party! Hit it, boys!

186
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:54,032
Vote for me,
we'll get funky this year!

187
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,910
This is your legacy, Pistachio.

188
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,914
These are your people,
and you are one of them.

189
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,984
But Papa runs a restaurant.

190
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,815
Your father was the world's
greatest Master of Disguise.

191
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,889
But Papa runs a restaurant.

192
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:18,223
This is what you are doing. This is
what I want you to do. Any questions?

193
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,758
Your parents, despite my objections...

194
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,835
...insisted on keeping
the legacy a secret.

195
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,871
-That's why we haven't spoken in years.
-But my papa--

196
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,137
It is time for you
to find your father and mother.

197
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,617
You mean, we will find
my father and my mother.

198
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,516
-lmpossible. Sorry.
-But why?

199
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,150
This is the sacred book
of the Disguisey way.

200
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,995
Like a Boy Scout handbook?

201
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,201
You cannot compare this book
to anything else known to man.

202
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,704
It's a pop-up!

203
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,941
"lf a father and mother are missing...

204
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:12,777
...only a son who has become
a Master of Disguise can save them...

205
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:17,445
...without any direct help
from the grandfather."

206
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,319
That's one specific farmer.

207
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:25,190
-Now I must find your father's nest.
-Come again? A "nest"?

208
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,161
Is there a place your father goes
to spend time by himself...

209
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:34,237
-...that is dark, that is secretive?
-The attic is dark and secretive.

210
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,005
Show me this attic.

211
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,206
So, Grandpa...

212
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,438
...this is the attic.

213
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,744
This is a pretty ordinary attic.
There's nothing--

214
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,049
What? What? What? What?

215
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,359
A magic ball.

216
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,306
Behold your father's nest.

217
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,065
Heavens to Betsy.

218
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,202
Yes. I knew he would keep one,
just in case.

219
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,711
Yes. Just in case.

220
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,213
Now you'll be a Master of Disguise.

221
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,217
Really?
A Master of Disguise?

222
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,824
I'm going to be a Master of Disguise
I'm going to be a Master of Disguise

223
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:04,224
Enough! Your mother and father
are in grave danger.

224
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,661
Your training begins...

225
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,233
...now!

226
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,092
Brilliant.
You are disguised as a fatty.

227
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,832
What is happening?

228
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,660
I'm getting bigger.

229
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,603
-I got so fat.
-Pistachio!

230
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,977
Remember me?

231
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,211
Devlin Bowman?

232
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,151
We both know you were the woman,
that night in Palermo.

233
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:40,853
Because of you,
I spent 20 years in prison.

234
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,824
Thanks to a potion
in the caramel corn...

235
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:52,595
...she thinks she's still at home
preparing dinner. But we know better.

236
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,500
Don't we?

237
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,839
Oh, my goodness!

238
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,075
Okay, okay. Stop.

239
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,676
We'll have soup today.

240
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:10,344
You're right.
I was Bo Derek that night in Palermo.

241
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,082
-What do you want?
-I want you to drop your pizza apron...

242
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,625
...become a Master of Disguise again...

243
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:21,164
...and help me obtain
the world's rarest treasures.

244
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,426
You're a sick man, Bowman.

245
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,806
-Are the teeth in?
-Yes.

246
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,108
Good. Here, and here.

247
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:44,084
There's minimal adhesive spillage.
That's not bad.

248
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,316
Good. Now all I have to do
is disguise my voice, right?

249
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,293
Open sesame. Open sesame.

250
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,263
Stop that!

251
00:23:55,634 --> 00:24:01,800
Buffoon! Clown! Anyone can put
on a disguise and change his voice.

252
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,636
But you said that was the secret power
of the Disguiseys.

253
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:11,108
Not exactly. It's time for you to learn
about the invisible energy field...

254
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,582
...that bonds all Disguiseys,
past and present.

255
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,412
It is called:

256
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:20,782
-Energico.
-Energico.

257
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:26,522
When you learn to tap into Energico,
you'll access words, skills, ideas...

258
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,825
...that you never dreamed possible.

259
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:33,493
You'll be able to act
and feel like another person.

260
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,469
You will become...

261
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,336
...another person.

262
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,342
Become another person.

263
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,013
But first, you must repeat the mantra:

264
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,744
Become another person.

265
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:52,014
-"Become another person." Nothing.
-Again.

266
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,181
-Become another person.
-Repeat.

267
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,226
Become another person.
Become another person.

268
00:24:57,395 --> 00:25:00,626
Become another person.

269
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,359
Good. Who are you now?

270
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,536
The question is, who are you?

271
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,037
I'm Prince Lali Jhamba
from the Ringy Dingy Heights...

272
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:13,268
...near Bombay, Calcutta
and New Delhi, lndia. India. India.

273
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,777
It is time to test that.

274
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,340
What is it?

275
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,547
That is a big reptile.
Not a problem.

276
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,069
Oh, yes.
He wouldn't hurt anybody now.

277
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,172
I'm going to call him Buttercup.

278
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,400
So cute, eh?

279
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,540
Tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle.

280
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,414
Energico.

281
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,212
God help me, I love it.

282
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,419
-Down, boy.
-A complete transformation.

283
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:05,921
You like the cheese. Go get
the cheese. You know you love it.

284
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:12,267
Now, sometimes during your travels,
you may be required to defend yourself.

285
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:16,134
Disguiseys don't believe in hitting
with a closed fist.

286
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,605
Always hit with an open hand.

287
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,871
Make your point,
but give the man his dignity.

288
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,106
-Dignity.
-Observe.

289
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,321
Elbows in, extend.

290
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,256
-Now you try.
-Elbow in, extend.

291
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,129
Okay, slappy-dummy man.

292
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,400
Well, I think I've got--

293
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,130
Pistachio, no.

294
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:50,638
Learn to empty your mind.
Allow Energico to flow through you.

295
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:56,304
-ls there a mantra for the hitting?
-No! But to demoralize your opponent...

296
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,315
...repeat the phrase,
"Who's your daddy?" in mid-slap.

297
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,248
Watch.

298
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,286
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?

299
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,157
Thanks for letting me
borrow the Constitution.

300
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,664
You're Michael Johnson,
the fastest man alive.

301
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,135
-You ready?
-Yes, sir, Mr. Johnson.

302
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,669
Go!

303
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,675
Thanks, guys!

304
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,940
You should read this, Bowman.

305
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,810
You might learn something.

306
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,684
I love having a Master of Disguise
do my bidding.

307
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,826
That's it.

308
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,624
Have you forgotten something?

309
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:48,321
My men are ready to pounce
on my command.

310
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,526
-No more. Please, stop.
-All right, all right.

311
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,158
Okay, so you want to play games?

312
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,061
Let's play games.

313
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,839
Who is your daddy?

314
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,066
I'm your daddy. I'm your daddy.
I'm your daddy....

315
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,387
She could be a good wife for you.

316
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,568
Well, am I truly
a Master of Disguise now?

317
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,799
Not exactly. You're a level-one
apprentice. White belt.

318
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:05,772
Yes! "Level one."
I like the sound of that one.

319
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:09,402
-How many levels are there?
-Seven thousand.

320
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:15,409
-That's many colored belts.
-Yes, you're a rookie.

321
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,954
Listen. It is a Disguisey tradition...

322
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,593
...at this point in time,
we hire you an assistant.

323
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,457
An assistant?
Yes, I am going to get an assistant.

324
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:30,931
-I was secretary for Jensen and Loeb--
-Get out!

325
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,627
-I beg your pardon?
-Out! Now!

326
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,305
Get out.

327
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,243
What are you doing here?

328
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,434
History!

329
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,044
Wrong! Take her away.

330
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,772
Get out. Idiot! Get out!

331
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,843
Freak. Get out!

332
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,849
Freak. Get out!
Freak. Out! Out!

333
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,282
Fifty applicants.

334
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,551
-Fifty losers.
-Yes.

335
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:01,823
Perhaps my destiny does not come
with an assistant.

336
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,098
I'm okay. I'm okay.

337
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:11,337
You too young for this job. Go home
and change your diaper. Get out!

338
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,999
I don't wear a diaper.

339
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,806
Pistachio. Come see.
There's a talking baby here.

340
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,439
I want to see the talking baby.

341
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,950
Brave Barney, good to see you.

342
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,281
-You know this baby?
-Of course.

343
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,789
-I was potty trained when I was 2.
-Of course.

344
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,452
You are the conductor
of the potty train.

345
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,394
Barney. Is this the place?

346
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,694
I just came from a yoga class.
I hope that's okay.

347
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,532
Grandpa, this is Barney and....

348
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:45,369
-I'm his mom, Jennifer. Hi.
-Jennifer. A pleasure, yes.

349
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:51,473
Sweetie, go practice your ollies,
and I'll see you later, okay?

350
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,549
Please, come in.

351
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:58,349
-Measurements.
-Measurements? What for?

352
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,525
-It's for a uniform.
-Oh, yeah. Okay.

353
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,557
It's 35-24-34.

354
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:09,064
-You said 34?
-A little bottom.

355
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,434
I don't know if I'm right for this.
Barney said you were looking....

356
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:22,169
I'm sorry, he's only 7.
He thinks your name is Pistachio.

357
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,871
That is my name.

358
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,516
Well, that's nice.

359
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:31,416
So okay. What is the job?
What exactly do you guys do?

360
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,616
I am a Master of Disguise.
He is also a Master of Disguise.

361
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,785
Technically,
he's a level-one apprentice.

362
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,726
"Master of Disguise"? I don't get it.

363
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,934
You got a problem with the word
"master," or "disguise"?

364
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,096
Or the word "of"?

365
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,765
Well, what would I have to do?

366
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,877
What does she have to do?

367
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:58,948
Not so fast. Answer me this first:
Do you fold easily under pressure?

368
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,051
What kind of pressure?

369
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:05,313
-The kind that makes you cry.
-Like a little baby in its crib.

370
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,221
-What's it pay?
-Pay? Paid in honor, dignity, pride.

371
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,488
Honor, dignity, pride...in its crib.

372
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,628
Actually, I need cash.

373
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,732
This cat has claws.

374
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,962
-Me likey.
-Me likey too.

375
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,003
But this cat's got no Mama caboose.

376
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,769
You guys know I can hear you, right?

377
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,365
It pays $41 7 a week,
plus Delta Dental.

378
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,195
-I'll take it.
-It's yours. But hear me.

379
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,863
Assistants fall in love
with their Disguisey masters.

380
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,976
Can you resist Pistachio?

381
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,839
Yes...

382
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,811
...can you resist me?

383
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:13,018
So listen to me true, Pistachio.

384
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,456
You are now a level 1.5 apprentice.

385
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,620
Without your help, how will I know
what to disguise myself as?

386
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,360
Listen to your Disguisey instincts.
Answer these questions for yourself:

387
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,666
Who, why, where, how would they take
your mother and father?

388
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,342
Yes. Who, why, where and why?

389
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,911
No, wrong! Who, why, where and how?

390
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,015
Oh, yes. Who, why, what?

391
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:44,587
-What and what and what and what?
-What? Wrong! Who, why, where, how?

392
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,419
-Yes. Who, why, where, how?
-That's it! You got it!

393
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,926
Yes! Who, why, where, how?

394
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,860
I say, who, why, where, how?

395
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,729
I say, who, why, where, how?

396
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:01,235
I say, who, why, where, how?

397
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,565
Yeah, you, employee.

398
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:10,107
My grandson is still raw.
He's unfocused.

399
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:14,444
When he becomes another person,
he may be unpredictable.

400
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,316
About the dental,
when Barney and I get stuff done...

401
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,923
...do I pay it,
then you reimburse me?

402
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:25,426
Or do I bill Delta Dental directly?
I'm not sure how it works.

403
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,393
You sicken me.

404
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,094
I almost forgot.

405
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,366
-Here is your Nest in a Box.
-"Nest in a Box"?

406
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:42,605
You may need it. It comes with
instructions. There is something else.

407
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,346
The Disguisey Ball of Knowledge.

408
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:53,786
When you are in dire straits and don't
know what to do, this will be handy.

409
00:34:55,126 --> 00:35:00,723
-I won't let you down, master.
-I hope not.

410
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,924
Disguisey thing comes with a lot
of accoutrements.

411
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,765
-So long, master!
-Bye-bye.

412
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,400
All right, now.
Where to begin our search?

413
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,738
Well, I guess we could look around
at the spot your father was taken.

414
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,146
That's your idea? That's it?

415
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,914
To look around at the spot
where my father was taken?

416
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,920
Well, that's crazy.

417
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:31,619
So crazy it just might work.

418
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,530
You know, this could be something.

419
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,671
Please, assistant,
don't play in the trash...

420
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,641
...while I am
in full father-finding mode.

421
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,781
I dated a guy who used to smoke these.

422
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,476
This cigar's from the Turtle Club.
Look at the label.

423
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,020
You want to play games?
I'll play games with you.

424
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,024
There we go.

425
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,863
I dated a guy who used
to smoke these.

426
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,660
This cigar's from the Turtle Club.

427
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:16,299
Jennifer, do you remember
the thing you once said...

428
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:20,137
...about the guy you used to date
from the Turtle Club?

429
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,843
Yeah.

430
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,346
Yes, my Disguisey instincts
are going crazy.

431
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,383
We should pay a visit
to this Turtle Club.

432
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:32,989
It's impossible to get in there.
You have to be a member.

433
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:34,986
You make me laugh.

434
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,890
We'll see what's impossible,
my ever-doubtful assistant.

435
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,860
Now, quickly...

436
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,159
...to the nest!

437
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:53,610
You know, the name the "Turtle Club,"
it's just a name.

438
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,270
-You're taking it too literally.
-Turtle.

439
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,382
May I help you?
You a member of the club?

440
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,416
-Not exactly.
-Not exactly.

441
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,613
But am I not turtley enough
for the Turtle Club?

442
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,514
-ls he okay?
-He's fine.

443
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,253
He's fine. Turtle.

444
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,229
Turtle.

445
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,800
He's dreamt of this place
ever since he was a child.

446
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:24,140
Do you think we can go in for a moment?
We'll be out in five minutes.

447
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,072
-Please.
-All right.

448
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,410
Turtle?

449
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,452
-Not turtle?
-No.

450
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,420
Turtle? Not turtle.

451
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,792
Could you tell me,
do you recognize this?

452
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:54,404
I recognize that. I made that cigar
for Devlin Bowman's private collection.

453
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:00,070
-Devlin Bowman.
-Turtle!

454
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,677
-ls he okay?
-He's fine.

455
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,150
-I'm fine. Turtle.
-Do you think you can give me...

456
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,757
...an address or phone number
for Mr. Bowman?

457
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,485
Are you crazy?
I can't give you that information.

458
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:22,031
No information.
What if harm found its way to you?

459
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,158
Terrible turtle harm.
Would that change your mind?

460
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:33,467
-It's time to go into my shell.
-No. No, shell.

461
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:38,138
-Shell time coming.
-A name is just fine. Thank you much.

462
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,782
Turtle harm.

463
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:44,819
The kind of harm that makes you cry out
in the night like a little baby.

464
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,480
Hey, baby. Can I buy you a drink?

465
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,650
And maybe some pond water
for your friend?

466
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,329
Very funny.

467
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,393
-Turtle!
-Where did he go?

468
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:22,554
I don't really know what to say
about what went on back there.

469
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:26,060
-I know, it was like a dream, but real.
-I don't--

470
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,530
Tomorrow we will find out
just who this Devlin Bowman is.

471
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,034
-This turtle thing--
-Then we'll find Mama and Papa.

472
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,002
If I'm going to work tomorrow...

473
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,909
...I'll need a lift
because my boyfriend has my car.

474
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,878
A boyfriend.

475
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,416
Yes, a boyfriend.

476
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,587
It's getting late.
I'm going to go in, okay?

477
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,691
Okay. Good night, my love-cake.

478
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,384
-"Love-cake"?
-What?

479
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,756
-You said "love-cake."
-Why would l?

480
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,421
-Your hindquarters are scrawny.
-What?

481
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:07,262
What I was trying to say is that...

482
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,599
...I have a present for Barney.

483
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,874
-Give this to him, from his dad?
-What?

484
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,582
Da-da-da-dat-ltalian guy. Me.

485
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:29,249
Oh, okay. This is very sweet of you.
Kneepads. He can use these.

486
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,460
-Well, thank you.
-Nighty-night.

487
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,159
Good night.

488
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,993
Sleepy time, she comes.

489
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,409
Thanks for the Liberty Bell.
I'll bring it right back.

490
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:55,416
And remember, that's an action figure,
not a doll.

491
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,845
Sure thing, Governor Ventura. Thanks.

492
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,918
Who'd have thought Governor Ventura...

493
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:06,995
...would be the perfect disguise
to abscond with the Liberty Bell?

494
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,098
Me.

495
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:15,003
My skills were meant for the betterment
of mankind, not for greed and evil.

496
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,799
Please.

497
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,369
You should see your hair.

498
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:27,310
You've got serious mask-head.

499
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:44,131
Pistachio, meet my boyfriend, Trent.

500
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:48,397
There he is.
Heard a lot about you, Pistach.

501
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,836
How are you?

502
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,871
I forgot my purse. I'll be right back.

503
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,307
Lay off my lady, you freak.

504
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:01,474
My, you are a touchy-feely guy, Trent.

505
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,646
Saved by the uncoordinated
little brat. Hey, Barn.

506
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,224
Grind that curb, buddy. Yeah!

507
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,657
I'm okay. I'm okay.

508
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,025
What a loser.

509
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,001
-Thanks for the pads. They help.
-You'll learn with practice, Barney.

510
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,332
I'll keep trying.

511
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,604
What kind of crap
are you putting in his head?

512
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,905
-Niceness?
-Niceness? What are you, his dad?

513
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,182
You trying to horn in on my action?

514
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,680
You trying to horn in on my action?

515
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,617
-What?
-What?

516
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,324
-You mocking me?
-You mocking me?

517
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,891
But I warn you, Trent.

518
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,401
My slap-practice dummy gets
quite a workout lately.

519
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,302
You want to fight?
See what awaits you?

520
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,704
First watch the feet. So fast.

521
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,970
Look at my hands. Look at them.

522
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,543
Too fast.

523
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,418
Hey, Barn.

524
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,792
Just keep practicing.
You'll just be fine, okay?

525
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,161
I'm ready.

526
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,740
How come I can't do it and you can?

527
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:38,742
Baby, I'll see you
after work, okay? Bye.

528
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:46,616
He is so good with children, huh?

529
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:54,155
I'm never gonna find anything
about this Devlin Bowman guy.

530
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,526
Who's your daddy?

531
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:00,126
Listen, classmate.com thing.

532
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,703
"To be the world's greatest
black marketeer...

533
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,636
...and possess
the rarest treasures on earth...

534
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,471
...then store them
in an underground lair."

535
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,446
What? This guy is crazy.
Did you hear this?

536
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:17,053
I can't believe he would write
something like this. Freaky guy.

537
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:22,115
Yes, we now know the who and the why.

538
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:27,855
But where do we find a man obsessed
with such a rarity?

539
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,399
Well, there's this memorabilia
fair tomorrow...

540
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,867
...with rare toys and stuff.
Maybe he'll be there.

541
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,169
So you think that Bowman
will show up...

542
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,074
...to see these rare items.

543
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,539
That's crazy. So crazy...

544
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:52,052
...it just might work.

545
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:58,754
Pistachio and Jennifer went to the
antique show hoping to find Bowman.

546
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:02,193
My grandson decided
to disguise himself as a lady.

547
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,730
Appraise this!

548
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,769
What are you doing?
That's the Nest in a Box.

549
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:12,668
It appears to be of Tuscan design.
I'd say early 1 2th century.

550
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,777
I knew it was old, you fool.

551
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:20,109
Let me appraise you: You're an idiot.
A complete idiot. How does it feel?

552
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,447
What is this?
1 2th century Tuscan? It's nice.

553
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,454
-I think that's him. That's Bowman.
-Oh!

554
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:31,617
Well, you're a tall drink of water.

555
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:35,424
-And I just love moisture.
-What?

556
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,093
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Gammy.

557
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,103
-Gammy Num Num.
-Devlin Bowman.

558
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,032
Don't be ashamed of your feelings.

559
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:51,307
Your desires are perfectly normal,
I assure you.

560
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:55,450
-What desires?
-Well, guess what, Backstreet Boy?

561
00:45:55,753 --> 00:46:02,215
This Girl Scout isn't content
to be the Malcolm in your middle.

562
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,327
-Run along, Gammy. Run along.
-Touching me!

563
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,588
Pushing me. There's pressure.

564
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,097
-Moving me back. Touching.
-Go. Go.

565
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,259
-What's your name?
-I'm Barbara.

566
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,165
Nice to meet you, Barbsie.

567
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,572
-We're never going to make babies.
-Right.

568
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,646
I'm having South American art dealers
to my house on Sunday.

569
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,749
We won't go anywhere
with you, melonhead.

570
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:31,479
-I'd love it if you'd join us.
-I'd love it if you'd shut up.

571
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,919
No need to bring anything...

572
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,458
...except that beautiful smile. Ciao.

573
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,792
"Ciao." Did you hear that? Italian.
Look out for the ltalian man.

574
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:45,958
Fetch! Come on, fetch!

575
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:53,108
-I'm not comfortable with the new plan.
-It's very easy. Listen.

576
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,178
If you will distract Bowman
at the party...

577
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,644
-...I'll disguise myself as a--
-No!

578
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,816
I'm Master of Disguise.

579
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,645
-I'm sorry--
-What sorry?

580
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,154
The job description didn't say anything
about dating weird old guys.

581
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,588
"Dating weird old guy."

582
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,358
What? Look.

583
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:19,992
Look what The Cuteness found.
On page 52...

584
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,231
...the scary monster say,
"From time to time, assistants...

585
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:28,242
...to level 1.5 apprentice
Masters of Disguise...

586
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:33,145
...may be required
to date weird old guys."

587
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,011
Well....

588
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,614
There you have it.

589
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,387
Their plan was simple..

590
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,549
Jennifer would sneak into the mansion
and look for clues...

591
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:46,355
...while Pistachio
would distract Bowman.

592
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,226
Gentlemen, sorry to keep you waiting.

593
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,027
My dear, I'm delighted you came.

594
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,535
Excuse me,
but where is the ladies' room?

595
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,437
In the main house, down the hall,
first door on your left.

596
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,373
-Want me to show you?
-No, it's okay.

597
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,446
-Hurry back.
-Okay.

598
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,247
Nice.

599
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:12,377
-Lovely woman.
-Will you excuse me, please?

600
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,060
We'll party all night long.
Right. Having fun.

601
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:23,223
-Have fun. I must speak to someone--
-Say hello to my little friend.

602
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,301
-What is that?
-Don't touch. See that?

603
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,065
That is a rare shrunken head
of a tribal chieftain...

604
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,201
...from the village
of Constopolocolus Holiholibosis....

605
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,818
I'm telling you,
Scooby-Doo is computer-generated.

606
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:55,055
No way! It looked so real.

607
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:59,258
I'm very interested in this,
but I have to check on something.

608
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,734
Choking?! Heimlich maneuver.

609
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:07,639
-I'm not-- I'm not-- I'm not choking!
-Are you choking or not? I gotta know.

610
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:10,939
-I'm not choking.
-Not choking. My mistake.

611
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,277
He was not choking, and I was doing the
Heimlich maneuver. Could be dangerous.

612
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,854
I'm sorry. That's my fault.
Someone's not choking...

613
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,421
...no maneuver!

614
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,217
No maneuver!

615
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:30,157
Robin, Ricky, it's him.
I better take these.

616
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,658
Chicken satay?

617
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:36,295
And get that little stick stuck
in my esophagus? Not a chance.

618
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,940
-What else you got?
-Crab cakes.

619
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,373
With your attitude,
they should be "crabby" cakes.

620
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:47,142
Now I'll ask you, have you got
a little wiener and some tiny nuts?

621
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,445
I could tell by looking at you,
that you had...

622
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:56,183
...a little wiener and some
tiny nuts. Oh, yeah.

623
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,394
Hi!

624
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:04,193
-I was just looking for the bathroom.
-ln the living room?

625
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,496
You had lovely furniture
and I just thought l'd--

626
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:09,971
I'll show you.

627
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,974
After you freshen up,
join me on the terrace for an aperitif.

628
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,704
It's lovely out there.

629
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,908
Oh, yeah! Gotta dance.

630
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,176
Who is this guy?

631
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:55,083
This idiot is ruining my party.
Bring him to me.

632
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,295
Did you see a dark-haired guy run by?

633
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,407
Dark-haired guy run by, chief?

634
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:23,577
Dark-haired guy go in the water.
Shark in the water.

635
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,885
Farewell and adieu...

636
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:34,820
-...my wee Spanish ladies.
-What are you talking about?

637
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:37,750
What?

638
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,087
What?

639
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:46,402
I'm talking about a great white, chief.
Two ton of him.

640
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,232
Twenty, maybe 25-footer.

641
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,765
There's no shark here.

642
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,411
You sure about that, chief?

643
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,446
You ever seen a shark's eyes, chief?

644
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:04,178
Kind of like dolls' eyes,
all black and lifeless-like.

645
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,981
Twenty nine kids go in the water.

646
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,285
Twenty two kids come out of the water.

647
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,293
The ice cream man, he take the rest.

648
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,955
April the 9th, half past 4 p.m.

649
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,368
Wait. Show me your arm.

650
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:24,974
You want to see my arm, chief?
That's my arm right there, chiefy.

651
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:32,304
Stop becoming another person.
Stop becoming another person....

652
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,108
It is him!

653
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,320
I run away from the big blue henchies!

654
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,795
-I stepped on a cow pie!
-Forget about it.

655
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:51,365
I told you he wasn't here.
Let's go back.

656
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,210
Fresh air.

657
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,305
I told you! There he is!

658
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:39,443
Hello. My name's Constable Mueller
from the Bavarian Tax Authority.

659
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:40,708
Hello.

660
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,981
I'm here looking
for Ms. Jennifer Baker.

661
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:48,052
She owes a substantial
amount of taxes...

662
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:53,094
...from her time as an exchange student
at the University of Heidelstrudel.

663
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,357
I just need to ask her
a couple of questions.

664
00:53:56,533 --> 00:54:01,903
Not going to bite her. Could I just
speak with her for just one moment?

665
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,597
Not going to bite.

666
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,106
-Freak.
-Yes?

667
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,747
Don't move.

668
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:16,274
-Wait right here.
-Yes, of course. Wait right here.

669
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:21,254
Doesn't sound too promising.
Maybe it's time to go to plan B.

670
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,984
You need to relax. Yes, you do.

671
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,755
God, no. I just--
I don't really like being touched.

672
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:32,497
-You dropped your purse.
-Thank you. I got it.

673
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,432
Okay.

674
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,734
-Let's see what's in here, shall we?
-There's nothing inside.

675
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:43,845
I had a little cold, so there's
medicine for that. It's gross in there.

676
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:47,983
Why don't you come with me, my dear?
This way. Yes.

677
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,413
Where did you come from?
Where's the other guy?

678
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:56,491
Suave. Terry Suave's the name.
London, Scotland Yard.

679
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:57,751
What do you want?

680
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,623
It's what the British government wants.

681
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:04,631
And that's a Miss Jennifer Baker--
At her service....

682
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:09,629
In regards to Operation Minty Hippo.

683
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,107
Minty Hippo? What is that?

684
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:15,472
I'd tell you, but it'd be a real
ding-dong-ding-wad...

685
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:19,513
...I need a Charleston Chew.
Get it? Got it? Doubt it.

686
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:23,983
-It's time for you to go.
-Put a squeeze on your chat box.

687
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,549
-What?
-This is what you're doing.

688
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:29,715
This is what I want you to do.
Any questions?

689
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:34,487
-Did you just tell me to shut up?
-Yes, you catch on straightaway.

690
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,225
The muscle. Yes, of course.
Familiar scenario.

691
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,026
You want to get physical?

692
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:43,229
A blow to the dewy gumbel
would start things.

693
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:48,537
Finally, a smack to the didgy dodge.
Did someone yell, "Timber"?

694
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:51,407
Listen. It is okay.

695
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,809
I did receive a letter.

696
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:59,352
She received a letter.
Get it? Got it? Doubt it.

697
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,513
Good day to you, sir.

698
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,330
Follow them.

699
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,571
I believe that Devlin Bowman...

700
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:21,768
...has forced my papa to become
a Master of Disguise once more...

701
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:26,644
...in order to steal rare treasures
from around the world.

702
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:34,720
My Disguisey instincts tell me
that they're in the mansion somewhere.

703
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:37,620
-My tight blue sweater!
-Sorry, Trent.

704
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:41,958
-Trent? Who is this?
-Hey, baby. We were just--

705
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,396
Sophia! You, here, with Trent?
What are the odds?

706
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,162
Shut up, clown.

707
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,397
-Leave him alone, you bully!
-Don't worry.

708
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:56,610
-The slapping time, she comes.
-I'm gonna enjoy this.

709
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,611
Pistachio, it demoralizes
your opponent...

710
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,718
...to repeat the phrase,
"Who's your daddy?"

711
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,183
Yes.

712
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,220
Who's your daddy, Trent?

713
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,257
Who's your daddy?

714
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,092
Having fun now, Trent?

715
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,395
How do you do?

716
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,417
Oh, Pistachio!

717
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:45,523
Thank you for saving me
from that horrible person.

718
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:48,288
Let's go, Jennifer.

719
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,499
Hey, my little waiter friend, Pistac--

720
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,342
Thanks for letting me borrow
the Apollo for my tour.

721
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,349
No problem, Miss Simpson.
Thanks for the CDs.

722
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,113
I hope you like them.

723
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,265
Jessica Simpson.

724
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:28,203
You seem tired, Frabbrizio.

725
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:29,633
Don't worry.

726
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,569
It's almost over.

727
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,799
You're insane!

728
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:40,037
-Thoroughly insane.
-Am l?

729
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,063
He's asleep with The Cuteness.

730
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:03,330
I want to get something off my chest.
Today, when I saw you dressed up...

731
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,838
...Iike the crazy, hairy guy...

732
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:09,445
...at that moment,
I really thought you were this...

733
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,410
...pathetic, insane, absurd...

734
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,416
...spastic little man.

735
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:22,081
And now I believe
that you can do anything.

736
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,057
That's very nice, but not true.

737
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:31,428
I can't turn mud into oatmeal, or build
a spaceship that will travel to Pluto.

738
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:37,266
But you can find a way to rescue
your mama and your papa.

739
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,367
Yes. Yes, I believe now too.

740
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:45,947
Your pep talk has transformed me,
tiny butter-bottom. I mean, Jennifer.

741
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,481
You said, "Tiny butter-bottom."

742
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,883
Did l, the future mother of my babies?
I mean, Jennifer?

743
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,717
You said,
"Future mother of my babies."

744
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:59,988
Did l, fat-cat mama
with the red dress on? I mean--

745
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:03,599
-You said, "Fat-cat"--
-I don't know why I said that.

746
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:08,260
It just was the emotion. It just....

747
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,131
My first kiss.

748
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:16,170
I must apologize,
I was a little forward.

749
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:20,475
But perhaps you enjoyed a little bit?

750
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,517
You know what time it is?

751
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:30,786
No, I don't know.
I don't know what time it is.

752
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:33,089
Time to make a plan.

753
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,265
Ah, yes. Yes.

754
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:40,493
Back to business.
The planning time, she comes.

755
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:42,398
Okay.

756
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:47,933
-All right.
-It's okay. It's okay. Nice.

757
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,511
-Fresh too. Night.
-Night.

758
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,338
-Night now.
-Good night.

759
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,224
The Cuteness was on guard.

760
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,796
But he'd be no match
against Bowman's henchmen...

761
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:13,868
...who had orders to kidnap Jennifer.
Time was running out...

762
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:19,532
...as Bowman put the final touches
on his evil scheme.

763
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:25,336
Grandfather, please, I need your help.
I am out of ideas.

764
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,822
Grandfather,
you are a big floating head.

765
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,189
I'm a prerecorded hologram.
What's your question?

766
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:44,390
I have not mustered enough Energico
to overcome our enemies.

767
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,694
I was hoping you'd be here.

768
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:50,669
-What you doing here?
-My mom's missing, but I found this.

769
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,741
-Bowman's cigar.
-ls my mom okay?

770
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,578
She's just out buying cigars now.

771
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,111
We have work to do!

772
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,910
I need a disguise to get
into the Bowman mansion.

773
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,519
-How about if you dress--?
-Silence!

774
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,451
Grandpa, why don't we
give him a chance?

775
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:10,183
Sometimes out of the mouth
of babies....

776
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,588
All right, but quietly.

777
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:15,390
You never know who might be listening.

778
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,728
That's crazy. So crazy--

779
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:22,735
It just might work!

780
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:30,111
Feast your eyes! Some of the world's
greatest treasures. The Liberty Bell.

781
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,373
There's Mona Lisa.
The ruby slippers.

782
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,484
A Betsy Ross original.
How about that David?

783
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:40,213
We got Bruce Willis' hairpiece
from Die Hard 2.

784
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:44,758
One of my prized possessions here,
the Apollo 1 1 Lunar Module.

785
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,088
Yep. One small step for man.

786
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,999
Black MarkEbay has a policy
of not asking how items are obtained.

787
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:55,331
But in your case, I am curious.

788
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:58,768
Italy's own Frabbrizio Disguisey.

789
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,603
Okay, so it is the Master of Disguise.

790
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,110
Want to see him?

791
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:15,254
-So you're gonna auction him off?
-Too easy.

792
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,161
-It's you.
-Right.

793
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,924
I'm going to Krazy Glue this
to Frabbrizio's head.

794
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:29,265
Then tomorrow, I'll push him over
a cliff. Everyone will think I'm dead.

795
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,771
It's called the perfect crime.
Ever heard of it?

796
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:35,536
Let me show you the rest of the items.

797
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:38,145
Mr. Bowman, no cherry pie?

798
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,210
Later, Palmer. Come on.

799
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:46,386
I don't even know where
this cherry pie came from.

800
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:48,113
Go figure.

801
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,668
These cherries are so ticklish.

802
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,745
And slippery.

803
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,116
The Cuteness, this is dangerous.
Go home.

804
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,662
It's Cherry Pie Man! Get him!

805
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,848
Jennifer was forced to be
the Black MarkEBay spokesmodel...

806
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:56,219
...as our nation's treasures
were auctioned off.

807
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,417
The famous "We the People. "

808
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,562
Yo, Doug. Check this out.

809
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:11,066
Did it ever occur to you that this
cherry pie thing was Frabbrizio's son?!

810
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,970
No matter.

811
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,111
Oh, by the way, Steve,
your wife called.

812
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,977
-Oh, that's great. Thank you, sir.
-Sure.

813
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:24,277
You're not married!

814
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,683
Pistachio?

815
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,185
Now we got you.

816
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:35,489
How did you know it was me?

817
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,002
Who's your daddy?

818
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:26,242
This little dude is slapping
these ninja guys senseless!

819
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,547
-I set you free!
-That's my belt!

820
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,684
-Wait! Ninjas!
-Out of the way!

821
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,055
Anyone who stays gets a raise!

822
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,532
No way! He slap us silly!

823
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,367
You may want to see this.

824
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,335
Smorgasbord.

825
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,270
Mama, look out!

826
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:08,221
No more caramel corn for me.

827
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:14,387
-Pistachio.
-Grandpapa.

828
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,896
I wanted to witness
your first Disguisey victory.

829
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,900
Hey, Disguiseys, it's not over yet.

830
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,800
First you will see who is your daddy.

831
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:31,403
I was going to throw him off a cliff.
Instead, I'll have him kill you.

832
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:46,286
-Papa. Papa!
-I am not your Papa.

833
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,920
He must have been pulled
to the dark side of Energico.

834
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,966
There's a dark side?
Exactly like Star Wars?

835
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:58,539
-I am Devlin Bowman!
-No, Papa, you are not Bowman.

836
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:04,407
Take off your mask. Let's all go grab
a bite to eat at the Olive Garden.

837
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,074
I am Devlin Bowman!

838
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:11,749
I have a secret underground lair...

839
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,254
...filled with rare objects!

840
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,891
Because of you Disguiseys...

841
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:22,588
...I spent 20 years
in the Palermo State Penitentiary.

842
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,596
I hate you!

843
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,491
-But, Papa--
-Pistachio!

844
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,865
This is between father and son.

845
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:33,269
-I am not your papa!
-Pistachio, be careful!

846
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:37,378
-You are my papa! I swear you are.
-No, I am not!

847
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,655
-Goodbye, peanut!
-No, Papa!

848
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,862
-Use the Energico, Pistachio!
-Yes.

849
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,795
Papa Bowman.
Please, don't you remember?

850
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:02,165
I'd put the underwear on my head.
You'd take it off.

851
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,898
Those were the days. Right?

852
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,341
What are you talking about?

853
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:12,641
Underwear coming....
Stuck in butt crack....

854
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:20,885
His underwear's on his head.
Just like when he was a little boy!

855
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:26,551
-Take those underwear off your head!
-Take that mask off your face.

856
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,794
Papa!

857
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,135
Moustache, Papa! Yes!

858
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,972
The nose! Yes!

859
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:47,643
Get the eye. Another! Yes!
Papa! Papa! Yes!

860
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:54,348
My son.

861
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,855
It's Frabbrizio!

862
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,056
Pull him up!

863
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,765
-The Disguisey tradition.
-Papa free!

864
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,697
So we freed Mama.

865
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:11,704
Jennifer became Mrs. Disguisey.
And Barney got a papa.

866
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:17,870
Finally, Pistachio became
a Master of Disguise.

867
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,573
There was one thing left to do.

868
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:25,052
We had to get the Constitution
from Bowman.

869
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:29,422
Can I get you anything?

870
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,423
What do you get a man
who has everything?

871
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,860
I can't believe it,
it's President Bush!

872
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,089
What?

873
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,262
Good to see you.

874
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:43,235
-Mr. President?
-Folks around here call me "W"...

875
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:46,806
...but you can call me King George.

876
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,210
That was a joke, son.

877
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,781
Mind if we had a picture together?

878
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,953
Take your time. I'm ready.
Say, "Who's your daddy?"

879
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,453
-Sir?
-This is what you're doing.

880
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:03,956
This is what I want you to do.
Questions?

881
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,787
It's you!

882
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:10,955
Yes. Yes, it is me,
the Master of Disguise.

883
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,800
-Get him!
-We're Disguiseys.

884
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,303
-I think I stepped in a cow pie.
-Forget about it.

885
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,806
Bring on the heat.

886
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,534
I came to get the Constitution back.

887
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,776
And this one's for you, chiefy!

888
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,058
Is he dead?

889
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,063
Bowman, he make the stinky.

890
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,823
-Who's!
-Your!

891
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,764
Daddy!

892
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:27,998
Say hello to my little friend.

893
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,877
By the authority
of the Disguisey tradition...

894
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:38,986
...page 73 of the pop-up book...

895
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:42,555
...I hereby pronounce you wife, son...

896
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:47,025
...and Master of Disguise.

897
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,858
Bravo, my son, bravo.

898
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:59,030
I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got there, I'll never know.

899
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,439
I'd like to spin you
on your spinely-spobbly spibbly.

900
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:06,375
Oh, baby going to cry?
His mommy called?

901
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,412
And cut.

902
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:19,093
-Run, Jennifer, run!
-Pistachio!

903
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,455
And...

904
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,391
...action!

905
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:39,175
I like the juice. You like the juice?

906
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,873
Sometimes that Master of Disguise
go away.

907
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:45,451
Sometimes he don't go away.

908
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:46,984
Okay, now...

909
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,555
...the Master of Disguise...

910
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,286
...can he change into, say...

911
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,090
-...Barbra Streisand?
-Of course.

912
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:01,396
-Britney Spears?
-You're a sick man.

913
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,565
The Olsen twins?

914
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:20,016
There's a nice,
cool little moustache there...

915
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:25,159
...on the big, bald, mean guy's face.
That's refreshing.

916
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:26,521
Hold!

917
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,195
Hold!

918
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,762
Hold!

919
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,661
Unleash hell.

920
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,890
I never knew if I'd see Jenny again.

921
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,058
-I've seen your type before.
-What are you doing?

922
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:11,000
I'm Gammy Num Num.
Then take a gammy of my nummy-nums.

923
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:15,165
We don't want to go anywhere
with you, melonhead.

924
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,977
You filthy thief!

925
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:29,351
Take that! And that! And that!

926
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:37,258
Buttercup says you are a bad man.

927
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,161
I'm not the dummy, he is.

928
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:43,828
Can you believe how stiff he is?
And I'm the one made of wood.

929
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,081
I don't want any trou-bubbles!

930
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,185
You got a little wiener--

931
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,882
Get the bee out. I won't play games.

932
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:09,520
-You got a little wiener-- Go away.
-Got a little bee.

933
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:13,395
There's no wiener.
There's just a bee.

934
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:21,241
I still have the greatest
anti-Disguisey weapon of all.

935
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,375
There's a dark side?
Exactly like Star Wars?

936
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,954
-What's going on?
-Pistachio's in grave danger.

937
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,750
Pistachio, come back!

938
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:40,959
A bottom.

939
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:54,239
Yes. I see now.

940
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:58,402
Love is thicker than your behinds.

941
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,973
Look what Daddy made for you.

942
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:06,416
A little sweater. I knit it last night
for you, little Buttercup.

943
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:10,456
My name is Gluteus Maximus.
Are you not entertained?

944
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,993
Why are your arms around
the tush queen?

945
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:18,155
Wait, I screwed it up.
She's the cake. You're the queen.

946
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:22,827
And remember,
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall.

947
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:28,500
No one really had a clue what he
was doing up there in the first place.

948
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:44,619
-Now show me some toys.
-Toys? Yes, of course. Toys. Here.

949
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:49,127
How about this?
This is the world's first giant yo-yo.

950
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:53,324
Oopsie-cadabra.
It looks more like a no-yo.

951
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,880
Hello?

952
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,879
What?

953
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,354
Hello?

954
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:30,900
What?

955
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:34,265
Who--?
Who are you?

956
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:38,343
What were you doing
in the slapping dummy?

957
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:40,174
Slap!

958
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:45,953
Come back here, slapping-dummy man.
It was you all along, all the time.

959
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:50,285
You were the one. I'm going
to get you. I'm going to get you.

960
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:53,961
Now, all right, all right.
Let's not fight.

961
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:59,761
I just want to talk, okay?
Now, listen. I just want to talk to you.

962
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:01,630
I slap you!

963
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,133
Come back here!

964
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:11,874
Come back here, slapping-dummy man.

965
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:16,807
I'll get you, Pistachio.

966
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:20,283
-Please, slapping-dummy man.
-I'll get you.

967
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:23,447
-I didn't mean it.
-I'll get you, Pistachio.

968
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:27,527
-I didn't mean it, slapping-dummy man.
-I'll get you.

969
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:31,957
So we find a nest,
and then we started training.

970
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:35,797
And then we go to the slapping
dummy, no offense.

971
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:40,840
But you gave me quite a workout a few
times. You must really love to slap.

972
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,977
-I love to slap.
-Yes, you love to slap, yes.

973
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:47,809
What are you people still doing here?
You saw the movie.

974
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:51,475
I'm trying to talk. All right? Goodbye.

975
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,484
All right, so anyway....

976
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,947
-Pistachio, I'm sad.
-What is the matter?

977
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,526
-I want to say goodbye.
-All right. We fade up.

978
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:03,129
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

979
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,199
No more dog food.

980
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:11,771
Turtle, turtle!
