1
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,658
...more airwaves silent and
most explosions in the Iraqi capital.

2
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,966
Further explosions are unfolding in Tikrit,

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,701
which is Saddam Hussein's
ancestral hometown.

4
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,107
...as well as blows from similar
explosions are unfolding...

5
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:50,582
Just a few seconds ago,
another huge blast shook this city.

6
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,682
Cruise missiles and airstrikes
raining down here

7
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,621
in a relentless assault
on Baghdad.

8
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,148
There is no doubt tonight
that war has begun...

9
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,663
and the Iraqi capital
is experiencing shock and awe.

10
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,800
<i>Approaching target site 3-5-9.</i>

11
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,000
All right, everybody,
listen up.

12
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,012
It is a military storage site.
Diwaniya.

13
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,011
Intel estimates possible nerve agents,
choking agents,

14
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,609
live pathogens,
chemical-tipped missiles.

15
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,247
101st has been here all morning,
so the site is secure.

16
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,848
Everybody stay focused.
This is it.

17
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,835
Shots fired, right side,
100 meters, tops.

18
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,839
We got shots fired.
Right side, 100 meters.

19
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,184
Let's go.
Move. Move!

20
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,683
Okay. Go ahead.

21
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,584
Who's the officer
in charge?

22
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,718
Move! Move! Move!

23
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,285
Hey! Who's in charge?

24
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,796
Right here.
Lieutenant Asira.

25
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,922
Chief Miller, Met-Delta.

26
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,830
What the fuck are all these looters
doing here?

27
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,064
This is a WMD site.
This is a high-priority site.

28
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,833
Look, I don't even have enough men
to set up the perimeter.

29
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,738
We got a sniper
in this tower right here.

30
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,003
In the big tower
on the back?

31
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,101
In the big tower
on the back.

32
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,113
I do not have enough men to go in and
secure the inside of that compound.

33
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,810
Listen, listen. Intel says we got
live chemical agents in this site.

34
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,079
Okay, we gotta move
now! These looters...

35
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,519
I don't know what these people
are carrying out right now.

36
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,557
I gotta get into this site.
I'm going in.

37
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,058
Chief, you can't go in.

38
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,651
If you take your team in
right now, it's on you.

39
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,823
Gather around. Gather around.
Come on. Listen, here's the situation.

40
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,492
101st sent 35 men and one butter bar
down here.

41
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,331
They don't even have
this place secure, so

42
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,768
here's where
we are right now.

43
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,568
Now, the weapons are in
the northwest end of the complex.

44
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,905
There's a sniper holed up in the
big tower there.

45
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,807
We're going to have
to quickly take him out.

46
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,041
I'm going to take a recon element forward.
I'm going to need C-BIST.

47
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,639
Marshall and Johnson, you come with me.
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,685
2 shooters, Potts, Michaels.
I'm going to need EOD.

49
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,152
Conway, bring Simms also.
Right here, sir.

50
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,052
Ready, Chief.
All right, stand by.

51
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,385
Chief, I gotta talk to you.
This is fucked.

52
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,790
Listen, this is
a disaster.

53
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,886
It is a disaster.
They haven't secured dick.

54
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,727
I don't think we should go in yet, Chief.
Let's get some acceptable intel.

55
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,893
No, no, no. Look at this! Jerry,
I got no idea what's coming out here.

56
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,869
I gotta go right now.

57
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,571
Keep comms open.
I'll be on 5.

58
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,630
Get a second team ready.

59
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,270
Let's go! Move! Move!

60
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,833
Guys, get that shit
off the truck now.

61
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,776
Roger that.

62
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,870
C-BIST?
Right here, Chief.

63
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,347
I want you to stay right on the backs
of your shooters, all right?

64
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,112
They will take you in.
Roger that, Chief.

65
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,209
All right. We ready?

66
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,413
Yes, sir!
Let's go. Go! Go!

67
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,189
Move! Move!

68
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,058
The sniper! Hey, Sarge!
Where is he?

69
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,585
He's right up there,
but we can't get down the alley.

70
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,674
Okay, everyone,
listen up.

71
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,541
Michaels! Michaels,
listen. Hey!

72
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:51,046
The WMD are in this building. I need you
to work your way to the rear door here.

73
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,744
See if you can get
an angle on that sniper.

74
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,310
I want you to take C-BIST with you.
Take Simms, also, with the long rifle.

75
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,514
Got it, Chief.

76
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,489
Hey, I gotta get across this alley.

77
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,752
I need some cover fire, all right?

78
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,884
Okay.

79
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,418
When the 203 goes, we're going to
go all the way down on the left side.

80
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,759
All right. Stand by.
Roger that, Chief.

81
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,992
Let's go.

82
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,499
Met-Delta team, go!

83
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,772
Move, move! Let's go!

84
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,035
Move! Move!

85
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,730
I got him. He's on the 5th floor,
southeast corner room.

86
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,565
I'm going to draw him out.

87
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,660
As soon as you see him,
take him.

88
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,726
Roger.

89
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,038
Now! Now! Now!

90
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,280
Got him?

91
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,291
We got him.
3 coming out.

92
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,724
Michaels, send C-BIST over.

93
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,227
Go! Go! Go!

94
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,633
Potts, Keating, go! Go!

95
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,837
Second team, move!
Let's go! Move! Move!

96
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,272
Move it!

97
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,504
In.

98
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,708
Check. Check.
Let's do it.

99
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,381
All right. Break out the gear.
I want everyone in full MOPP.

100
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,858
Now you heard Chief.
Get ready. Roll those seals tight.

101
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,821
I got it.

102
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,527
No readings in here, Chief.

103
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,535
All right,
Conway, open it up.

104
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,647
Nothing but toilet parts over here.

105
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,558
Is this all pigeon shit?

106
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,495
Yeah, thing looks like
it's been here about 10 years.

107
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,553
Yep.

108
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,134
This is no WMD site.

109
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,838
Pack it up.

110
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,203
Hey, Chief, we find anything?

111
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,404
The site's empty.

112
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,479
Standing by.

113
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,452
Hey, where did that
intel come from?

114
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,362
Do you want me to double check the
target number for you? Because I can.

115
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,524
No, no, we're in the right location.
The schematic's right.

116
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,431
But who did it
originate with? I mean...

117
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,629
Hey, did this come
from the United Nations?

118
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,867
According to this data, Chief,
this is our intel.

119
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,841
Yeah, but how would they think
something was there?

120
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,444
This is the third straight time.

121
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,642
Let's go.

122
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,481
You heard the chief. Move out.

123
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,353
All right, pack this shit up
and let's go.

124
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,411
Roger that!

125
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,081
Let's go! Move!

126
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,487
Step on it. Let's go.

127
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,401
Zubaidi will be on the middle chopper.
Get tight on his exit.

128
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,722
Swing it around.
Swing it around.

129
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,555
The DOD guy's here to meet him.

130
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,026
Reporting to you
live from the tarmac here...

131
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,836
Ready for the close-up?
Go, go, go!

132
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,398
That's Poundstone from DOD.

133
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,169
How's it going?

134
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,977
Great day.

135
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,514
Yup, you finally got him here.

136
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,950
Well, we feel like we're making progress.
That's important.

137
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,079
So, what about
the weapons?

138
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,651
I'm frustrated by that, too.

139
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,726
We're doing everything we can.
We'll find the weapons, don't worry about it.

140
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,855
The whole world's watching.
They want to know where they are.

141
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,661
Make sure Zubaidi and I
are in the lead car, okay?

142
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:09,996
Jack, I want
your guys to tail us.

143
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,093
You got it, sir.

144
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,501
Clark!
What?

145
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,198
I need the source.
I need Magellan.

146
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,110
Do you have any idea how
sensitive this is?

147
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,882
We've got Magellan locked up so tight,
I'm not even sure I can get to him.

148
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:28,113
You're the administration's go-to guy
and you can't access your own source?

149
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,212
Lawrie, we're debriefing him.

150
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,280
It takes time.
That comes first.

151
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,393
For Christ's sake, I've given you
everything I got on the guy so far.

152
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,225
What more do you want?
I don't want to hear it from you,

153
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,322
I want to hear it from him.

154
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,324
I'll see what I can do.

155
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,470
How are you?

156
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,699
Welcome home, sir.
We'll make this very brief.

157
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,538
How does it feel
to be back, Mr. Zubaidi?

158
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,339
Did you ever think
you'd see this day?

159
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,405
I'm an Iraqi citizen, returning
free to the city of my birth.

160
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:02,011
I call on all Iraqis to celebrate
our liberation from tyranny.

161
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,559
Bravo 1, we've got
2 mechanics taking a look at it.

162
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,687
Tracking on the upgun
is pretty well shot

163
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,755
and the comm links
are all shorted out.

164
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,097
What's the time frame
on a replacement?

165
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,447
I want a squad list, now!

166
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,611
Hey, where's Colonel Bethel?

167
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,811
He's in the back, Chief.

168
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,183
Thank you.

169
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,619
Roy, let me meet you
over here, okay?

170
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,351
Yeah, I'll meet you
in there.

171
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,524
Hey, sir.
Good to see you, Chief.

172
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,994
What's going on
with the intel?

173
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,553
You don't want to get into that
right now.

174
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,498
Well, we gotta talk about it. There's
nothing there. These sites are empty.

175
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,591
We're going to
be very careful,

176
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,693
or there's going to be
a huge shitstorm around here.

177
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,760
What do you mean?

178
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,567
They're blaming us
for not moving fast enough.

179
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,664
We have to stay on task.

180
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,574
That's bullshit.
The intel's no good.

181
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,268
Let's not make
any waves, okay?

182
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,246
They don't want to hear that back
in Washington.

183
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,579
All they're interested in is finding
something they can hold up on CNN.

184
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,017
Sir, but we gotta talk about this.
The intel is a problem.

185
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,816
Now is not the time, Chief.

186
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,621
Roo! On your feet!

187
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,957
Take your seats, people.

188
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,627
We're here this morning
to give the General

189
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,332
a check on where we are
in our search for WMD

190
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,932
and what our plans
are for the next 48 hours.

191
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,878
To that end, I'm turning the floor
over to Captain Jonathan Vaught.

192
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,471
Captain.
Sir.

193
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,714
Welcome, sir.

194
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,447
Today we're going to be briefing you
on WMD operations due to take place

195
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,820
in and around the Baghdad area
over the next 24 hours.

196
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,818
We're continuing to target
high-priority sites,

197
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,227
since all the folks back home are
anxiously awaiting the information

198
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,027
that we found these weapons.

199
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,668
We have a detailed media plan
we've worked out.

200
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,862
We've coordinated
with the public-affairs folks.

201
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,429
We have a good plan that
involves the top-rated media

202
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,168
in the United States
and the UK

203
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,178
so that they're prepared to cover
all aspects of the good news.

204
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,146
Yeah?
I had a couple questions

205
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,207
about the intel
for tomorrow.

206
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,445
Are we sure
this is accurate?

207
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,681
It's solid.
It's good to go.

208
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,746
What's the source?

209
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,019
Well, it's a human-source intel.

210
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,262
But it's solid.
It's current as of 0400.

211
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,393
Was it the same source
we've been using?

212
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,402
Every site we've hit on the way up here,
we've rolled a donut.

213
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,101
Chief, how about we do this?
Let's talk offline.

214
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,302
Give me a list of the places where
you went, and the grids,

215
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,470
and we'll make sure that you had
the right information written down

216
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,604
and that you went to
the right places, okay?

217
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,309
Captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir.
The issue's that there's nothing there.

218
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,545
Stand down, Chief.
We need to move on here.

219
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,750
Don, hold on. Hold a second.
Let's hear what the chief has to say.

220
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,082
Okay, sir,
I'll give you an example.

221
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,821
We rolled into a site,
Diwaniya, last week, okay?

222
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,558
101st took casualties
securing it for us.

223
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,499
We got in there and found
it was a toilet factory.

224
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,933
I'm saying there's a disconnect

225
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:08,167
between what's in these packets and
what we're seeing on the ground.

226
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,804
There's a problem
with the intelligence, sir.

227
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,605
Here's the thing, Chief.

228
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,374
These intelligence packages
have all been vetted.

229
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,880
They're good.

230
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,544
Your job's to execute them, not worry
about how they're put together.

231
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,519
Are we clear on that?

232
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,113
Yes, sir.

233
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,419
Good. Let's continue.

234
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,359
Sir, as I was saying, the intel is
as recent as 0400 this morning.

235
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,625
It's actionable
and it's solid.

236
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,597
All right, next up is
Al Mansour, Baghdad.

237
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,571
It looks like it's some kind of
underground storage site.

238
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,005
You got about 12 klicks of open
highway to the city,

239
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,337
but there's a lot
of activity on that road,

240
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,344
so tell everybody
to keep their heads up.

241
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,470
All right.

242
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,638
Chief?

243
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,443
All right.
We're going to go chem. Yeah?

244
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,574
I'm gonna get all
the lead teams up, all right?

245
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,708
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,445
Martin Brown, CIA.

247
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,748
Roy Miller.

248
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,982
Yeah, I know.
I saw you at the meeting.

249
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,457
You're going to
the Al Mansour site in Baghdad.

250
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,084
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.

251
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,462
UN biological team
hit it 2 months ago.

252
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,554
There's nothing there.

253
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,893
Fuck me.

254
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,601
Here's my card.
You're right.

255
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,760
This thing doesn't add up.

256
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,170
The Iraqis don't fight,
they don't use WMD,

257
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,573
they let us walk in here and
find the goddamn cupboard's bare.

258
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,407
There's something
wrong here.

259
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,572
We gotta figure
out what it is.

260
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,542
If you find anything,
you've got my number.

261
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,634
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

262
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,265
<i>We took on some fire
about 4 klicks back.</i>

263
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,838
<i>Pretty light, though.
Nothing to worry about.</i>

264
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,986
I gotta get some pictures of this.

265
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,583
Be my guest.

266
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,089
Heads up. Incoming.

267
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,791
Fucking Potts,
you red-headed dick.

268
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,275
Hey, Wilkins, this is Chief.
Get up here.

269
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,643
Hold on!

270
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,313
Yo, Kurry, let's go.

271
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,081
Please, get back. Please.

272
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,486
I want you to get a couple of the guys
and clear out this traffic.

273
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,990
We're too exposed out here.
We gotta keep moving.

274
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,289
Back from the truck.
Sir, take it easy.

275
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,350
Please.

276
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,523
Please, step aside.

277
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,030
I need you to move
the vehicle, sir.

278
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,157
Hey, hey, relax.

279
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,325
Easy!

280
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,160
Don't you fucking touch me!

281
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,666
Motherfucker, let's go.

282
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,174
Hey!
Shut the fuck up.

283
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,300
Back the fuck up!

284
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,345
Hey! Hey!

285
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,572
What's going on, Sergeant?

286
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,909
Chief, they're pissed off.

287
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,381
They say there ain't no water.
All they want is water.

288
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,975
There's nothing
we can do about that.

289
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,384
We just gotta get
our vehicles moving.

290
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,117
I want you to get the men
back in the vehicles now.

291
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,058
Hey! Hey!
Get in the fucking car!

292
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,760
Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck back in your vehicle!

293
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,925
Back from the truck.
Get back from the truck.

294
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,304
Don't stop.
No, sir.

295
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,957
Okay, so we're convening an Iraqi
Freedom convention

296
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,797
here inside
the Green Zone tomorrow.

297
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,603
We are expecting to have representatives
from all 3 main ethnic groups,

298
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,542
the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni,
angling for different levels of power.

299
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,274
It is our hope
that Ahmed Zubaidi

300
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,340
will emerge in
a leadership position.

301
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,481
Ben, are you satisfied that
we're in a good place now?

302
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,317
I think we're
in a good place now,

303
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,756
except for, perhaps, the press
we're getting from this looting issue.

304
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,758
Okay, well,
let's table that for now.

305
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,023
In terms of stabilization...

306
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,895
Zubaidi hasn't been
here for 30 years.

307
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,767
Well, he's the best bet we have right now
for a stable democracy.

308
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,900
You find me 10 guys in Baghdad
who even know who he is.

309
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,274
Well, he's our friend, Marty.
He's been very helpful.

310
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,937
Our office is
extremely satisfied

311
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,676
with all the information
that we've gotten from him.

312
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,218
Zubaidi's been selling us
a crock of shit for years.

313
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,278
This guy is not reliable.
His intelligence is not reliable.

314
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,050
His report chain
is not reliable.

315
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,525
This is exactly why people are losing
confidence in the Agency, Marty.

316
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,728
You're questioning every single piece
of intelligence that's coming in,

317
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,697
up to the point where
we can't make any progress.

318
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,599
You cannot just hand this country over
to an exile no one's ever heard of

319
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,534
and a bunch of interns
from Washington.

320
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,572
Well, you're
a Middle East expert, Marty.

321
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,733
If you got a better idea, why don't
you just throw it out here on the table?

322
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,300
We need to use
the Iraqi army to help us.

323
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,472
This country is a powder keg
of ethnic division.

324
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,142
Now Saddam is gone, they're the only
ones who can hold this place together.

325
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,651
We're not selling that
to the American people.

326
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,414
We beat the Iraqi army.
Right.

327
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,977
Well, they're still out there
and they're armed,

328
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,546
and they're looking
for a place in the new Iraq.

329
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,057
They're going to be
waiting a long time.

330
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,888
They didn't all
follow Saddam.

331
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,656
There are officers
we can work with out there,

332
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,787
if we make it
worth their while.

333
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,262
Hey, let me tell
you something.

334
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,095
We've spent too
much American treasure

335
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,657
and too many American lives

336
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,067
for us to put a Ba'athist general
into a position of power.

337
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:43,073
Have you any idea what's going on
outside the Green Zone?

338
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,235
It's chaos. No police,
revenge killings every night.

339
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,438
People are asking
why we can't stop this.

340
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,242
We are losing the population.
Democracy is messy.

341
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,907
Democracy is messy.

342
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,112
If you dismantle this country
and cut out the army,

343
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,280
you'll have civil war in 6 months.

344
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,550
I guarantee it.

345
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,057
Okay, let's move on.

346
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,381
We are continuing to hold at
the intersection at Alpha-Charlie-3.

347
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,473
Calm down!

348
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,710
Listen to me, please!

349
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,150
Just listen.
Sergeant Wilkins!

350
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,747
Get on the ground!
My arm!

351
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,815
Hey, what's going on
over there, Wilkins?

352
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,555
Chief, there's a local here.
He's out of control.

353
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,755
Perry had to tackle him.

354
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,354
I'm on my way.

355
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,565
All right, back up.

356
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,096
You stay the fuck down.

357
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,605
What's going on?
You are hurting me!

358
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,799
What's going on
here, Sergeant?

359
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,036
This Hajji says he needs to talk
to you about something.

360
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,873
I have no idea.
He goes on and on and on.

361
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:34,969
Stay down.

362
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,638
Why are you doing this?
Why you do it?

363
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,841
You agree someone
do this to you?

364
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,076
Hey, Perry. Perry.

365
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,209
You let him up.
Let him up.

366
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,343
You agree?

367
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,752
Up? I can stand up now?

368
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,615
Why you are doing this?
Why you are doing this?

369
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,455
You agree someone
put your head in the dust like this?

370
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,996
You agree to be treated like this?
This is not fair!

371
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,428
Hey, calm down.

372
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,999
I'm trying to calm down,
but this guy, he put me on the floor!

373
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,729
Are you finished?

374
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,897
Yeah, I'm finished.

375
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:02,997
What's your name?

376
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,942
My name is Farid Youssef Abdul Rahman.
You call me Freddy, okay?

377
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,106
I have information.
I was driving like 5 minutes from here.

378
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:14,551
I saw some people, you know, like
Saddam's men, like Ba'athist people.

379
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,144
They are meeting.
They have a meeting near to here.

380
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,019
I saw you are...
I don't know, you're digging here,

381
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,058
and I come to tell you.
Okay, just calm down. Hey!

382
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,094
Calm down. Calm down.

383
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,129
Why should I believe
you, Freddy?

384
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,791
You think it's easy to come
and talk to American?

385
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,733
You think it's easy? I come here,
all these people, they're looking at me?

386
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,997
You stick me on the floor.
I want to speak to you quietly.

387
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,163
And you are
digging in the ground.

388
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,729
Why you are digging
in the ground?

389
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,605
You need to talk to these people.
You know what they are saying?

390
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,737
You think someone can put
something in this place

391
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,680
with all these people watching and
all these people don't know?

392
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,410
It's not logical.

393
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,547
I am here to help you,
okay, Miller?

394
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,422
Come with me, Freddy.
Come with me.

395
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,519
Chief, you good?

396
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,029
Yeah, I'm fine.

397
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,995
Sir, come this way, please.

398
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,830
Hey, Chief! Chief,
what are we doing?

399
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,972
Hey, I'm gonna need his car keys.
Freddy, give him your car keys.

400
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,097
My keys?

401
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,199
Chief, you don't believe
this guy, do you?

402
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,301
Look, I wanna go
real low-vis on this.

403
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,779
I want to take Freddy's car and
I want to get maybe one other.

404
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,750
If we roll over there in those Humvees,
they're going to see us coming.

405
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,515
I want to take Keating, Potts,
Bronner on comms.

406
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,182
You gotta get me Michaels with
the SAW and bring Perry over here.

407
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,282
What's up, Chief?

408
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,417
Hey, you guys
ready to go to work?

409
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,551
Hell, yeah, Chief.

410
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,459
Chief, let me talk to you, please.

411
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,554
What?

412
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,326
Chief, our mission is here.

413
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,999
What, you wanna sit around
and dig holes all day?

414
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,764
I want to get something done.

415
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,108
All right, here's the situation.

416
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,007
This Iraqi just showed
up with information

417
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,705
that about 2 or 3 "K" west of here,

418
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,372
there's a meeting
taking place right now,

419
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,382
possible high-value
targets involved.

420
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,849
So I want to move on it.

421
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,355
In the first car, I want to
take the Iraqi guy, Freddy.

422
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,356
Keating, you're going
to drive, I'll ride shotgun.

423
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,688
Potts, you're in the back
covering Freddy the entire time.

424
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,251
The rest of you guys are going to roll in
the pick-up truck. Any questions?

425
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:08,823
Hey, Chief, how do we know this guy
isn't leading us into a fucking ambush?

426
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,265
We don't.

427
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,802
Get your fucking game face on.

428
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,666
Roger.

429
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,675
Hooah.

430
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,677
All right, let's roll.
You're not letting me drive?

431
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,973
No, you're not driving.

432
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,514
Weapons ready.

433
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,541
It's Freddy, right?
I'm Potts. Nice to meet you.

434
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,086
Fire it up!

435
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,498
Okay, Sergeant Perry,
I want you to carry on straight.

436
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,366
Take your next left, take your next left
and go around the back.

437
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,099
Roger that, Chief.

438
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,102
And if you stop here,
it is the house on that corner.

439
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,646
Okay, pull up here.
Pull up here.

440
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,616
Okay, be advised, it is the house
on the southeast corner.

441
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,209
The big white house
with the wall.

442
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,313
Heads up.
Someone's coming out.

443
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,188
There were 6 or 7 men with guns.

444
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:55,564
All right, we got a guy with a briefcase
and another with an AK-47.

445
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,466
Perry, where are you?
You in position?

446
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,406
In position, Chief.
We got them.

447
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,533
Black BMW with 3 men.

448
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:05,768
I want to take the BMW.

449
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,641
As soon as he comes up our way,
we're going to cut him off.

450
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,170
I want to take the BMW
and then the house. Go, go, go.

451
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,182
Go, go, go!

452
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,226
Out of the fucking car! Get
the fuck out of the car, now!

453
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,420
Perry, get on that door.

454
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,424
Get on that door.

455
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,965
Zip him up.
Bronner, stay with him.

456
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,397
Everybody else, go, go, go!

457
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,695
On me. Stack on me.

458
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,823
Let's go! Go, go, go!

459
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,127
On the fucking ground, now!

460
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,392
All right, down,
down, down.

461
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,326
Clear! This side clear!

462
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,567
I've got no exit. Where's the back door?
Michaels, with me!

463
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,165
Keating, on the stairs up!

464
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,671
Stairs down. Michaels,
come with me down! Down!

465
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,376
With you, Chief.

466
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,464
Taking fire!

467
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,168
Look out!

468
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,403
Get ready to hook right.

469
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,571
Hook right!

470
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,342
I got stairs up.

471
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,078
Clear. It's clear.

472
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,624
This is Chief.
Give me a sit rep.

473
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,160
This is Potts,
got one wrapped up.

474
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,423
Keating, all clear out front.

475
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,265
Chief, this is Perry.
I need you up here right away.

476
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,167
Coming in!

477
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,077
It's okay. Your husband is okay.
Perry!

478
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,873
Look, Chief,
you gotta do something.

479
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,278
They don't understand
what the fuck I'm saying.

480
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,347
This is the mother, that's the mother.
Enough! Enough.

481
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,484
Tell her to calm down.
Say, "Calm down."

482
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,152
I don't understand her, Chief
It's a different dialect.

483
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,788
Don't let her leave.
Don't let any of them leave this room.

484
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,456
There's a body down there.
Don't let them leave.

485
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,227
You got it, Chief.

486
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,300
Ma'am, you can't
go downstairs.

487
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,340
You cannot go
downstairs. Stay down.

488
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,098
Shut up! Shut up!

489
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,336
Watch yourself, Potts.

490
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,245
Get Freddy in here.
Stand him up. I gotta talk to him.

491
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,140
Freddy, come here.

492
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,684
I don't want this.
Hey, I need you to...

493
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,220
I come to you for information.
I don't want this.

494
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,779
Listen, I need you
to ask him questions for me.

495
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,155
Tell him you're
my translator.

496
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,826
Ask him...
Hey, what is this shit?

497
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,387
What is this?
Is this on him?

498
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,263
Yeah, that was fucking
in his back pockets.

499
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,802
He says he doesn't do anything.

500
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,701
Ask him his name.

501
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,936
His name's Seyyed Hamza.

502
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,443
Seyyed Hamza.
Is this his house?

503
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,343
Is this your house?

504
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,075
Hey, listen, tell him
he's gonna answer my questions

505
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,348
or things are going to go
very bad for him.

506
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,885
Ask him what the
meeting was about.

507
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,428
Chief, I just got
off the phone.

508
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,863
That license plate belongs to
General Mohammed Al Rawi.

509
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,230
The Jack of Clubs.

510
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,996
Shut the fuck up!

511
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,362
Hey, Michaels,
do you have that deck of cards?

512
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,463
Yes.

513
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,007
Give me the Jack of Clubs.

514
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,776
Is that the guy? Was that
the guy that went out the back?

515
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,004
Here it is, Chief.

516
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,842
Let me see. Let me see.

517
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,711
Is that the guy?
That's the guy. I just saw this guy.

518
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,079
Bullshit!
That's the fucking guy.

519
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,617
I just saw him downstairs.

520
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,711
This man. This is
Saddam's top general.

521
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,984
Al Rawi? You know
who this is? Al Rawi?

522
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,423
He say he don't know.

523
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,517
Al Rawi's in this house?

524
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,289
This is the guy I saw.

525
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,469
Okay. Time's up. Okay,
get everybody ready. We're leaving.

526
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,268
All right, he's got to know about WMD.
He's coming with me.

527
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,484
Hey, Freddy,
I want you to come with me.

528
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,148
Hey, Michaels!
What's up, Chief?

529
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,419
Bring them all
over to the wall.

530
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,893
Potts, I want you to get the guy.
Get the guy and bring him to me.

531
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,623
Roger that, Chief.

532
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,427
Just sit him down against the wall.
Yes, sir.

533
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,696
Sit those guys
over there.

534
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,370
Come over here, Freddy.
Come here. I need you to translate.

535
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,739
Tell him I want to know about
weapons of mass destruction.

536
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,805
Does he know where
the weapons are?

537
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,910
What? What?
What do you know about weapons?

538
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,177
Where are the weapons?

539
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,428
He say only General Mohammed Al Rawi,
he know about these things.

540
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,625
The special program
is under his hand personally.

541
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,301
He's the only one who know
the truth about these things.

542
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,533
Okay, how do
I find Al Rawi?

543
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,776
How do I find Al Rawi?

544
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,304
He said, can you
protect his family?

545
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:52,419
"If you protect my family,
I will tell you how you find Mohammed.

546
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,459
"And then from him
you will know the truth."

547
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,827
Okay, he's got a deal.

548
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,732
Ask him about the book.

549
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,761
What is it? Is it codes?
Is it diagrams? Maps?

550
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,444
What the fuck?

551
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,132
All right, Scotty,
head on down there.

552
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,107
Shorty, bag them and parade them.
Yes, sir.

553
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,541
Hey, you Miller?
Yeah.

554
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,044
Where are the other 2?

555
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,409
2 what?

556
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,606
We're missing 2 pucks.

557
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,239
Anybody got eyes on the other 2 pucks?
No, no, no!

558
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,944
These are my guys. Hold on.
These are my prisoners.

559
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,679
My prisoner now.

560
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,484
Hey! That's my translator!
That's my translator!

561
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,990
What the fuck is going on?

562
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,855
I got a colonel
waiting on these guys.

563
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,088
I got orders to get
these guys back there.

564
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,289
They're en route right now.

565
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,456
Hey, white bread,
calm down.

566
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,193
This goes way up higher
than your people, all right?

567
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,291
Please, stand right there.

568
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,892
Come on.
That prisoner's ours.

569
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,766
Well, he's mine now. Let's go.

570
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,305
Take care of my family!

571
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,563
What they are doing?

572
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,234
I did nothing!

573
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,681
The book!
He's got my book!

574
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,241
Chief, what the fuck's going on?

575
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,280
Fuck!

576
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,017
Yeah, I got him.
He says some guy took a book off him.

577
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,423
Book? All right, all right.
Notebook.

578
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,120
He says something
about a book.

579
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,220
His what?

580
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,322
You got his book.
He says you got his fucking book.

581
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,390
Do you have the guy's notebook?
Don't fuck around.

582
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,196
I don't know what
you're talking about.

583
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,261
Get your fucking
hands off me, asshole.

584
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,238
Just give me the
fucking book, Miller.

585
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,407
All right.

586
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,787
I fucking asked you nicely!

587
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,330
Fuck you!
I don't have a fucking book!

588
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,462
Have a nice war.

589
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,407
All right,
let's get out of here!

590
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,476
Get off me!

591
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,422
Hey!

592
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,891
Where's Freddy?

593
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,831
You mean the guy with the limp?
Yeah.

594
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,028
He went over
by the alleyway.

595
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,298
Fuck! I thought you
were watching him.

596
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,237
Where's my weapon?
Right here!

597
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,298
I gave him the book.
I gave him the fucking book!

598
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,776
Potts, Michaels, go with him now!
Go! Let's go! Let's go!

599
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,437
Bronner, hey! Come on!

600
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,878
Moving!

601
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,448
Go! Go!

602
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,282
Go around!
Seal it! Seal it!

603
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,122
You got it, Chief!

604
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,087
Get him, Potts.

605
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,726
Go left!
Go, seal it, seal it.

606
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,233
I got him! Stop!

607
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,901
Stop!

608
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,240
Get him! Get him!

609
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,318
What the fuck! What the fuck!
Why are you running?

610
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,415
Why you are chasing me?

611
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,392
Give me the book.

612
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,450
Give me the fucking book!

613
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,258
Here the book.
Here the book.

614
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,529
Why are you... What you are doing?
I was going to bring the book back.

615
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:01,002
The man is putting Iraqis in the helicopter.
He hit you in the face.

616
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,903
What you want me to do?

617
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,737
What I have to do
for you to believe me?

618
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,300
Get everyone
back to the trucks.

619
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,606
Roger.

620
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,204
Hey, let's go.
Let's go.

621
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,978
What more I have to do for you?

622
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,848
I come to you with information.
You take the information, it's right.

623
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,448
You want the book. I have the book.
I give you the book.

624
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,187
You think I can
leave my car?

625
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,695
You know what this car,
it means to me?

626
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,732
Even you have the key!

627
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,804
What happened to your leg?

628
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,010
My leg is in Iran.

629
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,241
Since 1987.

630
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,714
Me, too, I fight
for my country.

631
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,519
Freddy, listen.
You give me your information.

632
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,651
I'm going to get you a reward
for what you did today.

633
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,989
Reward?

634
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,028
You think I do
this for money?

635
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,794
You think I don't care about my country?
I see what's happening.

636
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,566
You don't think I see
what's happen in it?

637
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,470
And all the people now,
even they have no water,

638
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,565
they have no electricity.

639
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,473
You think I do this
for reward?

640
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,978
You don't think
I do this for me?

641
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:19,607
For my future? For my country?
For all these things?

642
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:23,141
Whatever you want here,
I want more than you want.

643
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,347
I want to help my country.

644
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,729
Who is this?

645
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,069
<i>Hey, this is Chief Miller.</i>

646
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,637
I have something
I think you'd be interested in.

647
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,339
<i>Listen, I don't have time to play games.
Just tell me what you've got.</i>

648
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:54,009
Well, this morning I came face to face
with Mohammed Al Rawi.

649
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,449
General Al Rawi?

650
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,817
Yeah, the Jack of Clubs.

651
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,014
<i>Come in and talk to me.</i>

652
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,888
I'm in the Green Zone, Republican Palace.
By the pool.

653
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,184
I'm on my way.
Listen, make sure Johnson runs checks...

654
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,196
Hey, Sergeant Wilkins,
I gotta talk to you.

655
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,858
We gotta go get our prisoner back,
find this guy, Al Rawi.

656
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,128
Let Bethel handle it, please.

657
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,500
No. Bethel can't see past
the files on his desk.

658
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,833
So, what, you're going to ring
the doorbell now

659
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,463
and ask Special Forces
to hand him over? No.

660
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,269
I'm going to use the book and
trade up and get some help.

661
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,366
What are you
talking about?

662
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,412
Jerry, why the fuck do we keep
coming up empty on all these sites?

663
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,572
There has gotta
be a reason.

664
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,849
Chief, we're here to do
a job and get home safe.

665
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,679
That's all.
The reasons don't matter.

666
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,548
They matter to me.

667
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,350
With all due respect, Chief,
I can't go with you on this.

668
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,624
Understood. I'm going
to split the team.

669
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,254
I'm going to take my crew
plus Sergeant Perry.

670
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,061
You report back to Bethel
with everyone else, hooah?

671
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,225
Hooah.

672
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,365
Hey, Freddy.
You want a job?

673
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,466
Yes.

674
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,272
Good. Get in your car,
follow us.

675
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,369
Where to, Chief?

676
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,936
Republican Palace.

677
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,389
This is not
a good time, Lawrie.

678
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,725
I've waited long enough.

679
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,027
I told you,
I'm doing the best I can.

680
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,500
This is not what
I signed up for, Clark.

681
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,969
I put my reputation
on the line with these stories.

682
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,972
I am not going to let you hang
me out to dry.

683
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,200
Well, there's huge
things at stake here.

684
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,176
I'm not going to let them be compromised
because you need to sell some newspapers.

685
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,543
You knew the deal. I give you Magellan,
you give me anonymity.

686
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,478
Listen, Clark, I'm done waiting,
so is the paper.

687
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:39,416
You won't help me find Magellan,
I'm going to find someone who can.

688
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,442
Right here.

689
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,439
Can you get me some more beers?
Frisbee!

690
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,847
Shit!

691
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,355
My goodness.
We got enough time for that?

692
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,555
These guys got Domino's Pizza
and fucking beer?

693
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,797
Get in the pool, man.

694
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,493
Sergeant Perry, I've gotta
go talk to this guy,

695
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,126
so you all are on your own
for a little while.

696
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,534
Roger that.

697
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:01,628
Can we have beer?

698
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:02,967
Not one.

699
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,013
So, what happened?

700
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,815
We were digging at a site.

701
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,289
Local come up to us and give us a tip
that there was a meeting going on

702
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,383
with some high-value
targets nearby.

703
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,588
We hit the house, and it turned out
the guy was right. Al Rawi was there.

704
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,632
You sure it was him?
Positive.

705
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,361
He had a security detail with him,
and we exchanged fire with them

706
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,268
and he slipped out
during the firefight.

707
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,011
Now that's the book that I took off
this guy, Seyyed Hamza.

708
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,445
He was the host
of the meeting.

709
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,676
And I was in the process
of figuring out what the fuck it was

710
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,275
when SF showed up
and snatched him.

711
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,918
God damn!

712
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,684
Okay, but where
did they take him?

713
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,918
Because if you can get me
access to this guy,

714
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,654
I'll get Al Rawi.

715
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,761
Look, we're both
after the WMD, right?

716
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,594
It's a little more
complicated than that.

717
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,400
Well, not to me, it isn't.

718
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,671
All right, I'll make a call,
get you reassigned.

719
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,305
There are some empty buildings on
the other side of the compound.

720
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,747
Get out of uniform and
report to my office in an hour.

721
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,307
Outstanding.

722
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,863
How'd you get
the bloody nose?

723
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,992
That's a long story.

724
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,763
You're in the 85th.
That's WMD unit, right?

725
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:44,733
How did you know that?

726
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,571
It's right there
on your rifle.

727
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:50,238
Lawrie Dayne, Wall Street Journal.
How's it going?

728
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,310
You know, we haven't found shit yet.
Hey, Sergeant Perry.

729
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,376
We'll find it.
It's frustrating, right?

730
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,580
Little bit.

731
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,488
So what are you
and Marty talking about?

732
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,856
You know I can't
talk to you about that.

733
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,417
Come on.

734
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,659
You come in fresh off the field to
have a lemonade with Martin Brown?

735
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,064
Something's gotta be going on.

736
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,834
Well, you could ask him.

737
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,201
I'm asking you.

738
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,673
Does it make sense to you that
we're still coming up empty?

739
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,371
No. No, it doesn't.

740
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,839
Someone told us
they were there, right?

741
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,179
If you come
across anything,

742
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,447
call me.

743
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,963
I'll keep it in mind.

744
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,012
Where's he hiding? Where's Al Rawi?

745
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,654
Where's Al Rawi?

746
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,525
How long have
they been going?

747
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,855
For about 10 minutes.

748
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,453
You want to see your wife
and kids again? You have 5 kids.

749
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,122
You want them
to see their father?

750
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,101
He says, "Please, do not involve
my family in this situation."

751
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,695
"I swear to God... "

752
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,366
You're involved,
so your family's involved.

753
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,274
All I want is an answer,
where to look for this man,

754
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,676
and you can walk out of here.

755
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,408
Where's Al Rawi?
Where's Al Rawi?

756
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,280
And I want a name or an address.

757
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:44,618
Somewhere I can find
General Al Rawi.

758
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,747
I am going
to get an answer,

759
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,883
and you know you're going to
tell me something.

760
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,397
All right, I'm going to let go and
you're going to give me an address.

761
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,231
Where's Al Rawi?
Where is he?

762
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,135
The book! The book!

763
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,864
He says you need the book.

764
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,339
The fucking book again?
What's in the book?

765
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,706
"The book,
that's how you'll find him."

766
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,338
It has the names and locations
of Al Rawi's safe houses.

767
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,388
Chief Miller around?

768
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,194
Yeah. Up the stairs,
down on the right.

769
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:44,505
Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone,
Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.

770
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,606
A great job bagging Hamza.

771
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,477
Thanks. Appreciate it.

772
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,076
Walk you out?

773
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,879
Sure.

774
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,955
You're with our MET Team, right?
Yeah.

775
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,993
Well, the administration really appreciates
the work you guys are doing.

776
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,187
We gotta get this WMD
issue behind us

777
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,129
so we can get on with the challenges
of the future.

778
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,894
That's where this Hamza guy
could be helpful.

779
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,764
He's confirmed
a few facts for us.

780
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,135
Says your guys might have
lifted a notebook from him.

781
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,868
Well, everything
I got off him I gave to Martin Brown.

782
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,569
Why don't you ask him
if he's got it?

783
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,133
I don't think Marty would go for that.

784
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,612
He's a hell of a guy, but he's been
in the Middle East a long time.

785
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,149
He's got a lot of
preconceived ideas.

786
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,378
Our unit's trying to get
back to the raw intel.

787
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,680
Look, I don't want
to throw Marty under a bus,

788
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,552
but he doesn't like
what we're coming up with.

789
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,681
The guy's a dinosaur,

790
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,250
and we need to get some new thinking
going on around here.

791
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:34,229
There's an opportunity
for you here, Miller.

792
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,730
I know Marty's pulled
you in temporarily,

793
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,735
but if you're looking for something
more permanent, I can help.

794
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,929
We're doing a good thing here.
We're going to rebuild this place.

795
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,976
People are watching us.

796
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,439
I'll keep it in mind.

797
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,846
You do that.

798
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,842
If you hear anything about
that notebook, let me know.
