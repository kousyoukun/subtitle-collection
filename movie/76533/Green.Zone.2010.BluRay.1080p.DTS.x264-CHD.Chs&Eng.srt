Yeah, but how would they think something was there?

133
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,444
又有正事了
This is the third straight time.

134
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,642
我们走
Let's go.

135
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,481
听准尉的 我们走
You heard the chief. Move out.

136
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,353
好了 收好东西 我们走
All right, pack this shit up and let's go.

137
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,411
收到!
Roger that!

138
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,081
我们走! 行动!
Let's go! Move!

139
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,487
上车 我们走
Step on it. Let's go.

140
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:06,101
萨达姆国际机场

141
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,401
Zubaidi在中间的直升机上 密切关注他一举一动
Zubaidi will be on the middle chopper. Get tight on his exit.

142
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,722
转过来 转过来
Swing it around. Swing it around.

143
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,555
美国国防部人员来这与他会面
The DOD guy's here to meet him.

144
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,026
从机场为您带来的实况报道...
Reporting to you live from the tarmac here...

145
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,836
准备好拍特写了吗? 走 走 走!
Ready for the close-up? Go, go, go!

146
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,398
那是美国国防部的Poundstone
That's Poundstone from DOD.

147
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,169
怎么样?
How's it going?

148
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,977
很好
Great day.

149
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,514
嗯 最终在这见到他了
Yup, you finally got him here.

150
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,950
嗯 我们觉得我们一直都有进展 那很重要
Well, we feel like we're making progress. That's important.

151
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,079
那么 武器的问题呢?
So, what about the weapons?

152
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,651
那也很让我沮丧
I'm frustrated by that, too.

153
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,726
我们尽己所能 我们将会找到武器 不必担心
We're doing everything we can. We'll find the weapons, don't worry about it.

154
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,855
全世界都在关注 他们想知道武器在哪
The whole world's watching. They want to know where they are.

155
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,661
我和Zubaidi一定要坐第一辆 好吗?
Make sure Zubaidi and I are in the lead car, okay?

156
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:09,996
Jack 我要你们都跟在后面
Jack, I want your guys to tail us.

157
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,093
明白 先生
You got it, sir.

158
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,501
- Clark!  - 怎么了?
- Clark!  - What?

159
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,198
我需要消息来源 我需要Magellan的消息
I need the source. I need Magellan.

160
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,110
你知道这问题有多敏感吗?
Do you have any idea how sensitive this is?

161
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,882
Magellan已经被彻底监禁了 我自己都不确定能联系到他
We've got Magellan locked up so tight, I'm not even sure I can get to him.

162
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:28,113
你是行政机构的核心管理人员 你不能联系到你自己线人?
You're the administration's go-to guy and you can't access your own source?

163
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,212
Lawrie 我们正在审问他
Lawrie, we're debriefing him.

164
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,280
这需要时间 要先来后到吧
It takes time. That comes first.

165
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,393
天哪 到目前为止从他那得到的消息 我都告诉你了
For Christ's sake, I've given you everything I got on the guy so far.

166
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,225
- 你还要些什么?  - 我不想从你这得知
- What more do you want?  - I don't want to hear it from you,

167
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,322
我想听他告诉我
I want to hear it from him.

168
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,324
我会再看看的
I'll see what I can do.

169
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,470
你好啊?
How are you?

170
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,699
- 欢迎回家 先生  - 我们做个简短的采访
- Welcome home, sir.  - We'll make this very brief.

171
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,538
回来的感觉怎么样 Zubaidi先生?
How does it feel to be back, Mr. Zubaidi?

172
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,339
你有没想过有这么一天?
Did you ever think you'd see this day?

173
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,405
我是伊拉克公民 应该能自由地回归故里
I'm an Iraqi citizen, returning free to the city of my birth.

174
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:02,011
我会邀请所有的伊拉克人民庆祝从暴政中解放
I call on all Iraqis to celebrate our liberation from tyranny.

175
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,559
好极了 有两名技工正在检查
Bravo one, we've got two mechanics taking a look at it,

176
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,687
核查结果为 顶部枪支发射情况良好
Tracking on the upgun is pretty well shot

177
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,755
通信链接全部短路
and the comm links are all shorted out,

178
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,097
换成了什么时段?
What's the time frame on a replacement?

179
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,447
我要小队列表 马上!
I want a squad list, now!

180
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,611
嘿 Bethel上校在哪?
Hey, where's Colonel Bethel?

181
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,811
他在后面 准尉
He's in the back, Chief.

182
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,183
谢谢
Thank you.

183
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,619
Roy 我在那边等你 怎么样?
Roy, let me meet you over here, okay?

184
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,351
好 我们那里见
Yeah, I'll meet you in there.

185
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,524
- 嘿 长官  - 很高兴见到你 准尉
- Hey, sir.  - Good to see you, Chief.

186
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,994
情报机构怎么了?
What's going on with the intel?

187
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,553
你现在不会想知道的
You don't want to get into that right now.

188
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,498
我们必须谈谈 那什么都没有 那些地点都是空的
Well, we gotta talk about it. There's nothing there. These sites are empty.

189
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,591
我们行动将要非常仔细
We're going to be very careful,

190
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,693
否则就会被扣上大屎盆
or there's going to be a huge shitstorm around here.

191
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,760
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

192
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,567
他们归咎于我们行动速度不够快
They're blaming us for not moving fast enough.

193
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,664
我们还得继续执行任务
We have to stay on task.

194
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,574
胡扯 情报不准
That's bullshit. The intel's no good.

195
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,268
冷静点 行吗?
Let's not make any waves, okay?

196
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,246
他们不想回华盛顿 再听到这句话
They don't want to hear that back in Washington.

197
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,579
他们所感兴趣的就是 找到些能堵住CNN嘴的东西
All they're interested in is finding something they can hold up on CNN.

198
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,017
长官 但是我们必须谈谈 情报是个问题
Sir, but we gotta talk about this. The intel is a problem.

199
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,816
现在还不是时候 准尉
Now is not the time, Chief.

200
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,621
呜! 起立!
Roo! On your feet!

201
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,957
请坐 各位
Take your seats, people.

202
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,627
今早在这 是来让将军审查
We're here this morning to give the General

203
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,332
我们搜索的可能藏有大规模杀伤性武器的场所
a check on where we are in our search for WMD

204
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,932
以及未来48小时我们的计划
and what our plans are for the next 48 hours.

205
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,878
为此 有请Jonathan Vaught上尉发言
To that end, I'm turning the floor over to Captain Jonathan Vaught.

206
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,471
上尉 长官
Captain. Sir.

207
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,714
欢迎各位
Welcome, sir.

208
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,447
今天 我将要简短地向你们说明 在未来的24小时
Today we're going to be briefing you on WMD operations due to take place

209
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,820
可能发生在巴格达以及其周边地区的大规模杀伤性武器行动 
in and around the Baghdad area over the next 24 hours.

210
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,818
我们将继续将重点考虑的地点作为目标
We're continuing to target high-priority sites,

211
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,227
这是因为所有家人都焦急地等待着
since all the folks back home are anxiously awaiting the information

212
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,027
我们找到了这些武器的消息
that we found these weapons.

213
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,668
我们已经商量出缜密的媒体计划
We have a detailed media plan we've worked out.

214
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,862
我们已经和与公众事务相关的人们进行协调
We've coordinated with the public-affairs folks.

215
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,429
我们已有完善的计划 这涉及到
We have a good plan that involves the top-rated media

216
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,168
美国和英国一流的媒体
in the United States and the UK

217
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,178
因此他们准备好对好信息的各个方面进行报道
so that they're prepared to cover all aspects of the good news.

218
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,146
- 什么?  - 关于明天的情报
- Yeah?  - I had a couple questions

219
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,207
我有几个疑问
about the intel for tomorrow.

220
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,445
确定这是准确消息吗?
Are we sure this is accurate?

221
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,681
很可靠 行动没有问题
It's solid. It's good to go.

222
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,746
消息来源是什么?
What's the source?

223
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,019
呃 这是线人提供的情报
Well, it's a human-source intel.

224
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,262
但是这很可靠 4点刚拿到的
But it's solid. It's current as of 0400.

225
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,393
我们用过相同来源的情报吗?
Was it the same source we've been using?

226
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,402
我们抄剿每个地点时 都像无头苍蝇一样
Every site we've hit on the way up here, we've rolled a donut.

227
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,101
准尉 我们这么做如何? 待会再谈
Chief, how about we do this? Let's talk offline.

228
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,302
给我个清单 列上你去过的地方和坐标
Give me a list of the places where you went, and the grids,

229
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,470
我们会检查你写下的信息是否正确
and we'll make sure that you had the right information written down

230
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,604
去过的地方是否没错 好吗?
and that you went to the right places, okay?

231
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,309
上尉 问题不在于位置 问题是那儿什么东西都没有
Captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir. The issue's that there's nothing there.

232
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,545
暂停争论 准尉 我们得就此问题继续
Stand down, Chief. We need to move on here.

233
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,750
Don 暂停 暂停一下 让我们听听准尉的说法
Don, hold on. Hold a second. Let's hear what the chief has to say.

234
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,082
是 长官 举个例子
Okay, sir, I'll give you an example.

235
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,821
上周 我们进到了一个地点 在Diwaniya 知道吗?
We rolled into a site, Diwaniya, last week, okay?

236
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,558
为了给我们开路 101队还有队员受伤
101st took casualties securing it for us.

237
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,499
我们进去后发现那是个洁具工厂
We got in there and found it was a toilet factory.

238
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,933
我想说的是
I'm saying there's a disconnect

239
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:08,167
情报和我们实际看到的之间有差异
between what's in these packets and what we're seeing on the ground.

240
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,804
情报有问题 长官
There's a problem with the intelligence, sir.

241
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,605
事情是这样的 准尉
Here's the thing, Chief.

242
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,374
这些情报都是经过审查的
These intelligence packages have all been vetted.

243
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,880
没有问题
They're good.

244
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,544
你们的任务是执行 不用操心怎么来的情报
Your job's to execute them, not worry about how they're put together.

245
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,519
明白了?
Are we clear on that?

246
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,113
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

247
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,419
好的 继续
Good. Let's continue.

248
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,359
长官 如我刚才所言 情报是凌晨4点才拿到的
Sir, as I was saying, the intel is as recent as 0400 this morning.

249
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,625
是可执行的 准确的
It's actionable and it's solid.

250
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,597
好的 接下来是 巴格达的Al Mansour
All right, next up is Al Mansour, Baghdad.

251
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,571
看起来像是地下仓库
It looks like it's some kind of underground storage site.

252
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,005
进到那座城市要走12公里开放的高速路
You got about 12 klicks of open highway to the city,

253
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,337
但路上状况很多
but there's a lot of activity on that road,

254
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,344
叫大家提高警惕
so tell everybody to keep their heads up.

255
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,470
好的
All right.

256
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,638
准尉?
Chief?

257
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,443
好的 我们要去找生化武器 明白?
All right. We're going to go chem. Yeah?

258
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,574
我去集合带头队伍 好吗?
I'm gonna get all the lead teams up, all right?

259
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,708
好 好的
Yeah, yeah.

260
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,445
我是中央情报局的 Martin Brown
Martin Brown, CIA.

261
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,748
我是Roy Miller
Roy Miller.

262
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,982
是的 我知道 我在会议上见过你了
Yeah, I know. I saw you at the meeting.

263
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,457
你要去巴格达的Al Mansour吧
You're going to the Al Mansour site in Baghdad.

264
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,084
- 是的  - 你在浪费时间
- Yeah.  - You're wasting your time.

265
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,462
联合国生物组2个月前去了那里
UN biological team hit it two months ago.

266
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,554
那儿什么都没有
There's nothing there.

267
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,893
混蛋
Fuck me.

268
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,601
这是我的名片 你说得对
Here's my card. You're right.

269
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,760
情报和事实有出入
This thing doesn't add up.

270
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,170
伊拉克人不打仗 不用大规模杀伤性武器
The Iraqis don't fight, they don't use WMD,

271
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,573
他们让我们进来却一无所获
they let us walk in here and find the goddamn cupboard's bare.

272
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,407
事有蹊跷
There's something wrong here.

273
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,572
我们得弄清楚
We gotta figure out what it is.

274
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,542
如果有所发现 给我电话
If you find anything, you've got my number.

275
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,634
确定 确定
That's affirmative, That's affirmative,

276
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,265
我们在后方四公里处遇到枪袭
We took on some fire about four klicks back,

277
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,838
但是火力很小 不用担心
pretty light, though, nothing to worry about.

278
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,986
哦 我得拍点照片
Oh, I gotta get some pictures of this.

279
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,583
随便
Be my guest.

280
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,089
抬头 来了
Heads up. Incoming.

281
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,791
该死的Potts 你个傻帽
Fucking Potts, you red-headed dick.

282
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,275
嘿 Wilkins 我是准尉 到这边来
Hey, Wilkins, this is Chief. Get up here.

283
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,643
来了!
Hold on!

284
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,313
唷 Kurry 赶快
Yo, Kurry, let's go.

285
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,081
退后 请退后
Please, get back. Please.

286
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,486
你去找几个人开开路
I want you to get a couple of the guys and clear out this traffic.

287
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,990
我们过于暴露了 得保持前行
We're too exposed out here. We gotta keep moving.

288
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,289
离车远点 先生 冷静
Back from the truck. Sir, take it easy.

289
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,350
拜托
Please.

290
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,523
拜托 靠边
Please, step aside.

291
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,030
请你把车移开 先生
I need you to move the vehicle, sir.

292
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,157
嘿 嘿 冷静
Hey, hey, relax.

293
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,325
放松!
Easy!

294
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,160
你他妈的别碰我!
Don't you fucking touch me!

295
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,666
妈的 我们走
Motherfucker, let's go.

296
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,174
- 嘿!  - 闭嘴
- Hey!  - Shut the fuck up.

297
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,300
滚开点!
Back the fuck up!

298
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,345
嘿! 嘿! 嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿!
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

299
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,572
怎么回事 中士?
What's going on, Sergeant?

300
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,909
准尉 他们很愤怒
Chief, they're pissed off.

301
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,381
说这儿没水 他们只想要水
They say there ain't no water. All they want is water.

302
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,975
对此我们无能为力
There's nothing we can do about that.

303
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,384
我们只是要前进
We just gotta get our vehicles moving.

304
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,117
你去把人都叫回车里
I want you to get the men back in the vehicles now.

305
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,191
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

306
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,058
回车上去!
Get in the fucking car!

307
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,760
回去! 回车上去!
Get the fuck back! Get the fuck back in your vehicle!

308
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,925
离车远点 离车远点
Back from the truck. Get back from the truck.

309
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,304
- 别停  - 是的 长官
- Don't stop.  - No, sir.

310
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,304
临时联合政府总部 前萨达姆宫殿

311
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,957
好的 所以我们要召开伊拉克自由会议
Okay, so we're convening an Iraqi Freedom convention

312
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,797
明天在绿色地带举行
here inside the Green Zone tomorrow.

313
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,603
我们希望三大种族集团的代表
We are expecting to have representatives from all three main ethnic groups,

314
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,542
包括库尔德族 什叶派(穆斯林)和逊尼派(伊斯兰教)都参会 代表不同阶层的意见
the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni, angling for different levels of power.

315
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,274
我们希望Ahmed Zubaidi
It is our hope that Ahmed Zubaidi

316
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,340
以领袖之姿出现
will emerge in a leadership position.

317
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,481
Ben 你对我们现在的状况满意吗?
Ben, are you satisfied that we're in a good place now?

318
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,317
我认为我们状况还不错
I think we're in a good place now,

319
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,756
不过可能还有些趁火打劫的情况
except for, perhaps, the press we're getting from this looting issue.

320
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,758
好的 我们暂且不提这个
Okay, well, let's table that for now.

321
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,023
说到稳定...
In terms of stabilization...

322
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,895
Zubaidi已经30年没来过这儿了
Zubaidi hasn't been here for 30 years.

323
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,767
但他是我们目前稳定局势的最佳人选
Well, he's the best bet we have right now for a stable democracy.

324
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,900
在巴格达 认识他的人不到10个
You find me 10 guys in Baghdad who even know who he is.

325
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,274
他是我们的朋友 Marty 他帮了不少忙
Well, he's our friend, Marty. He's been very helpful.

326
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,937
我们这边的人都很满意
Our office is extremely satisfied

327
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,676
他提供给我们的情报
with all the information that we've gotten from him.

328
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,218
Zubaidi这些年来一直卖垃圾情报给我们
Zubaidi's been selling us a crock of shit for years.

329
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,278
这家伙靠不住 他的情报不可靠
This guy is not reliable. His intelligence is not reliable.

330
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,050
他的线人也靠不住
His report chain is not reliable.

331
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,525
这就是人们对情报局失去信心的原因 Marty
This is exactly why people are losing confidence in the Agency, Marty.

332
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,728
你对每条情报都心存怀疑
You're questioning every single piece of intelligence that's coming in,

333
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,697
这样下去我们寸步难行
up to the point where we can't make any progress.

334
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,599
你不能把这个国家交给无人知晓的流放者
You cannot just hand this country over to an exile no one's ever heard of

335
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,534
和华盛顿的几个实习生
and a bunch of interns from Washington.

336
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,572
好吧 你是中东专家 Marty
Well, you're a Middle East expert, Marty.

337
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,733
如果你有更好的主意 为什么不现在就提出来?
If you got a better idea, why don't you just throw it out here on the table?

338
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,300
我们要利用伊拉克军队的帮助
We need to use the Iraqi army to help us.

339
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,472
这个国家是种族分歧的炸药桶
This country is a powder keg of ethnic division.

340
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,142
现在萨达姆完蛋了 他们是唯一能将这个国家聚在一起的力量
Now Saddam is gone, they're the only ones who can hold this place together.

341
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,651
我们不能以此说服美国人民
We're not selling that to the American people.

342
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,414
- 我们在和伊拉克军队打仗  - 好的
- We beat the Iraqi army.  - Right.

343
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,977
他们仍然在那儿 全副武装
Well, they're still out there and they're armed,

344
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,546
他们想在新伊拉克有立足之地
and they're looking for a place in the new Iraq.

345
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,057
够他们等的
They're going to be waiting a long time.

346
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,888
他们不是都追随萨达姆的
They didn't all follow Saddam.

347
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,656
如果我们让他们觉得值得的话
There are officers we can work with out there,

348
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,787
里面也有能与我们合作的军官
if we make it worth their while.

349
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,262
嘿 告诉你吧
Hey, let me tell you something.

350
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,095
美国花费了大量的金钱
We've spent too much American treasure

351
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,657
牺牲了很多生命
and too many American lives

352
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,067
才让叙利亚社会党上台
for us to put a Ba'athist general into a position of power.

353
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:43,073
你知道绿色地带外面正在发生的事情吗?
Have you any idea what's going on outside the Green Zone?

354
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,235
一团混乱 没有警察 每晚都有仇杀
It's chaos. No police, revenge killings every night.

355
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,438
人们质问我们为什么不能阻止这些
People are asking why we can't stop this.

356
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,242
- 我们正失去民心  - 民主造成的混乱
- We are losing the population.  - Democracy is messy.

357
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,907
民主造成的混乱
Democracy is messy.

358
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,112
如果你分裂这个国家 裁掉军队
If you dismantle this country and cut out the army,

359
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,280
六个月内就会有内战
you'll have civil war in six months.

360
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,550
我保证
I guarantee it.

361
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,057
好了 我们继续
Okay, let's move on.

362
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:27,057
兄弟们

363
00:22:28,624 --> 00:22:31,057
我们得到消息 萨达姆逃跑了

364
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:35,857
美国人占领了这个国家

365
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,257
我们面临艰难的抉择...

366
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,957
我们的人正在待命

367
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:48,857
我们此时的决定将会决定伊拉克的未来

368
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,381
我们仍在AC3号路口守卫
We are continuing to hold at the intersection at Alpha-Charlie-three,

369
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,473
冷静!
Calm down!

370
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,710
听我说 拜托!
Listen to me, please!

371
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,150
听着 Wilkins中士!
Just listen. Sergeant Wilkins!

372
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,747
- 趴下!  - 我的胳膊!
- Get on the ground!  - My arm!

373
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,815
嘿 那边出什么事了 Wilkins?
Hey, what's going on over there, Wilkins?

374
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,555
准尉 那边有个当地人 发疯了
Chief, there's a local here, He's out of control,

375
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,755
Perry得搞定他
Perry had to tackle him,

376
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,354
我来了
I'm on my way.

377
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,565
好了 后退
All right, back up.

378
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,096
你他妈的趴好
You stay the fuck down.

379
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,605
- 怎么回事?  - 你弄伤我了!
- What's going on?  - You are hurting me!

380
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,799
出什么事了 中士?
What's going on here, Sergeant?

381
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,036
这个伊斯兰教徒说他有话要跟你说
This Hajji says he needs to talk to you about something.

382
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,873
我没招了 他一直这样
I have no idea. He goes on and on and on.

383
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:34,969
趴好了
Stay down.

384
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,638
你为什么这么做? 为什么?
Why are you doing this? Why you do it?

385
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,841
你能允许别人这么对你吗?
You agree someone do this to you?

386
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,076
嘿 Perry Perry
Hey, Perry. Perry.

387
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,209
让他起来 起来
You let him up. Let him up.

388
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,343
你允许?
You agree?

389
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,752
起来? 我可以起来了?
Up? I can stand up now?

390
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,615
你为什么这么做 啊? 凭什么?
Why you are doing this, huh? Why you are doing this?

391
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,455
你能允许别人这样把你的头按在土里?
You agree someone put your head in the dust like this?

392
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,996
你能允许别人这样对你? 这不公平!
You agree to be treated like this? This is not fair!

393
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,428
嘿 冷静
Hey, calm down.

394
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,999
我试着冷静 但这个家伙 把我按在地上!
I'm trying to calm down, but this guy, he put me on the floor!

395
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,729
你够了没?
Are you finished?

396
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,897
好了 够了

- All right, let's roll.  - You're not letting me drive, huh?

453
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,973

454
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,514
武器就位

456
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,086
发动车子!
Fire it up!

457
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,396
我们就要输了 到处都是美国人...

458
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,896
叛徒! 你就是个叛徒!

459
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,896
就是有你这样的害群之马 情况才会变成这样!

460
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,896
我?

461
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,896
像我这样的害群之马?

462
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,796
瞎了你的狗眼啊!

463
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,896
美国人现在居然把我们的权利转交给什叶派和库尔德人

464
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,096
我们现在必须反抗!

465
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,896
我们要怎么和美国人打?

466
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,296
趁现在还不晚 我们要反击!

467
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,449
同志们...

468
00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:10,849
现在街上到处处于无政府状态

469
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:14,749
暴力事件不断增加...

470
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:19,749
如果美国人想在这儿推行民主的话

471
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:27,849
他们最终会意识到我们的重要性

472
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:33,449
那时候他们会向我们求助...

473
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,749
而我们就可以乘机就国家未来达成协议

474
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:38,749
先生...

475
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:41,849
如果他们不跟我们联系呢?

476
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:46,349
那样的话...

477
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:49,849
我们就开战

478
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,498
好了 Perry军士 你继续开
Okay, Sergeant Perry, I want you to carry on straight.

I come to you with information. You take the information, it's right.

666
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,448
你要那本书 我有 也给你了
You want the book. I have the book. I give you the book.

667
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,187
你认为我能少了我的假肢?
You think I can leave my car?

668
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,695
你知道这条腿 它对我来说意味着什么吗?
You know what this car, it means to me?

669
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,732
我都把最关键的都给你们了!
Even you have the key!

670
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,804
你腿怎么了?
What happened to your leg?

671
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,010
丢在伊拉克战场上了
My leg is in Iran.

672
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,241
1987年就丢了
Since 1987.

673
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,714
我也为我的祖国而战
Me, too, I fight for my country.

674
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,519
Freddy 你瞧 你给了我们重要情报
Freddy, listen. You give me your information.

675
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,651
我们为你今天的所作所为 给你报酬的
I'm going to get you a reward for what you did today.

676
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,989
报酬?
Reward?

677
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,028
你们认为我这是为了钱?
You think I do this for money?

678
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,794
你觉得我不关心我的祖国吗? 我看着她遭受战火纷飞
You think I don't care about my country? I see what's happening.

679
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,566
你觉得我对这一切视而不见吗?
You don't think I see what's happen in it?

680
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,470
现在所有的人 甚至都没有水
And all the people now, even they have no water,

681
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,565
they have no electricity.
643 
也没有电

682
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,473
你却觉得我这是为了赏金?
You think I do this for reward?

683
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,978
你难道不觉得我是为了我自己?
You don't think I do this for me?

684
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:19,607
为了我的将来? 为了我的国家? 为了这一切? 
For my future? For my country? For all these things?

685
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:23,141
不管你想做什么 我都比你更想把它做好
Whatever you want here, I want more than you want.

686
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,347
我想帮助我的国家
I want to help my country.

687
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,729
哪位?
Who is this?

688
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,069
嘿 我是Miller准尉
Hey, this is Chief Miller,

689
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,637
我这有点东西 我想你应该会感兴趣
I have something I think you'd be interested in.

690
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,339
听着 我没时间跟你玩游戏 直接告诉我你有什么吧
Listen, I don't have time to play games, Just tell me what you've got,

691
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:54,009
好吧 今早我可是跟Mohammed Al Rawi见了一面
Well, this morning I came face to face with Mohammed Al Rawi.

692
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,449
你说Al Rawi将军?
General Al Rawi?

693
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,817
对 那个梅花J
Yeah, the Jack of Clubs.

694
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,014
来找我谈谈
Come in and talk to me,

695
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,888
我在绿区 共和国宫殿 游泳池旁边
I'm in the Green Zone, Republican Palace. By the pool.

696
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,184
我这就来 
I'm on my way.

697
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,196
嘿 Wilkins中士 我得跟你谈谈
Hey, Sergeant Wilkins, I gotta talk to you.

698
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,858
我们得把我们的犯人带回来 然后再找出这个Al Rawi
We gotta go get our prisoner back, find this guy, Al Rawi.

699
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,128
就让Bethel去处理吧 拜托
Let Bethel handle it, please.

700
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,500
不行 Bethel对过往文件从不过问的
No. Bethel can't see past the files on his desk.

701
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,833
所以 你就这么直接去敲特种部队的门
So, what, you're going to ring the doorbell now

702
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,463
- 然后请他们把他交给你?  - 不
- and ask Special Forces to hand him over?  - No.

703
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,269
我得利用这本书 弄点高层内幕 以期有所帮助
I'm going to use the book and trade up and get some help.

704
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,366
你说的是什么意思?
What are you talking about?

705
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,412
Jerry 这些情报为什么总让我们扑空?
Jerry, why the fuck do we keep coming up empty on all these sites?

706
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,572
肯定是有原因的
There has gotta be a reason.

707
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,849
准尉 我们只是想完成任务然后安全回家
Chief, we're here to do a job and get home safe.

708
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,679
仅此而已 原因之类的 无所谓
That's all. The reasons don't matter.

709
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,548
但我有所谓
They matter to me.

710
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,350
恕我直言 准尉 这事我帮不了你
With all due respect, Chief, I can't go with you on this.

711
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,624
好吧 我会把队伍分开
Understood. I'm going to split the team.

712
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,254
我带上我的小队加上Perry中士
I'm going to take my crew plus Sergeant Perry.

713
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,061
你带着其他人去回Bethel报告 明白?
You report back to Bethel with everyone else, hooah?

714
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,225
明白
Hooah.

715
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,365
嘿 Freddy 想来帮忙吗?
Hey, Freddy. You want a job?

716
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,466
好吧
Yes.

717
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,272
很好 开上你的车 跟着我们
Good. Get in your car, follow us.

718
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,369
去哪 准尉?
Where to, Chief?

719
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,936
共和国宫殿
Republican Palace.

720
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,389
现在可不是好时候啊 Lawrie
This is not a good time, Lawrie.

721
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,725
我等得可够久了
I've waited long enough.

722
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,027
告诉过你 我已经尽力了
I told you, I'm doing the best I can.

723
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,500
这可不是我该做的啊 Clark
This is not what I signed up for, Clark.

724
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,969
我的声誉和这些故事系于一线
I put my reputation on the line with these stories.

725
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,972
我可不会让你这么坑害我
I am not going to let you hang me out to dry.

726
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,200
你看 我这还有紧急的事要处理
Well, there's huge things at stake here.

727
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,176
我可不能因为你要卖什么新闻而把大事给耽误了
I'm not going to let them be compromised because you need to sell some newspapers.

728
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,543
不是都说好了 我告诉你Magellan 你不能讲出我的名字
You knew the deal. I give you Magellan, you give me anonymity.

729
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,478
听着 Clark 我等够了 报社也等够了 
Listen, Clark, I'm done waiting, so is the paper.

730
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:39,416
要是你不帮我找Magellan 我就让别人帮我找
You won't help me find Magellan, I'm going to find someone who can.

731
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,442
就在这儿
Right here.

732
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,439
- 再给我来点啤酒好吗?  - 飞盘来了!
- Can you get me some more beers?  - Frisbee!

733
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,847
哦 该死!
Oh, shit!

734
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,355
哦 我的老天啊 我们还有时间干这些?
Oh, my goodness. We got enough time for that?

735
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,555
这些人吃着达美乐比萨还喝着冰啤酒?
These guys got Domino's Pizza and fucking beer?

736
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,797
到池子里来 哥们
Get in the pool, man.

737
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,493
Perry中士 我得和这个人谈一谈
Sergeant Perry, I've gotta go talk to this guy,

738
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,126
所以你们可以自由活动一会儿
so you all are on your own for a little while.

739
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,534
收到
Roger that.

740
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:01,628
能喝杯啤酒吗?
Can we have beer?

741
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:02,967
没门
Not one.

742
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,013
所以 是怎么回事?
So, what happened?

743
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,815
我们正在目标点挖掘
We were digging at a site.

744
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,289
一个当地人跑来告诉我们 
Local come up to us and give us a tip that there was a meeting going on

745
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,383
附近有一些高层的人正在开会
with some high-value targets nearby.

746
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,588
我们袭击了开会点 发现那人没撒谎 Al Rawi就在那儿
We hit the house, and it turned out the guy was right. Al Rawi was there.

747
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,632
- 你确定是他吗?  - 不会错的
- You sure it was him?  - Positive.

748
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,361
他有一群保镖跟着他 我们交了火
He had a security detail with him, and we exchanged fire with them

749
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,268
结果他趁乱逃走了
and he slipped out during the firefight.

750
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,011
这本书是我从一个叫Seyyed Hamza的人身上得到的
Now that's the book that I took off this guy, Seyyed Hamza.

751
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,445
会议是由他主持的
He was the host of the meeting.

752
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,676
我正想办法问清事情的原委 
And I was in the process of figuring out what the fuck it was

753
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,275
结果特种部队冲了过来 就这么把他带走了
when SF showed up and snatched him.

754
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,918
真该死!
God damn!

755
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,684
是啊 可是他们把他押到哪了?
Okay, but where did they take him?

756
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,918
只要你能让我接近这个人
Because if you can get me access to this guy,

757
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,654
我就能抓到Al Rawi
I'll get Al Rawi.

758
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,761
我们都是为了找到大规模杀伤性武器 没错吧?
Look, we're both after the WMD, right?

759
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,594
事情其实没有你说的那么简单
It's a little more complicated than that.

760
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,400
但在我看来 不是这样
Well, not to me, it isn't.

761
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,671
好吧 我会打电话 让你重新分配到他那
All right, I'll make a call, get you reassigned.

762
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,305
这院子的另一边有很多空房子
There are some empty buildings on the other side of the compound.

763
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,747
脱掉制服 一小时后到我办公室报到
Get out of uniform and report to my office in an hour.

764
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,307
好极了
Outstanding.

765
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,863
鼻子怎么流血了?
How'd you get the bloody nose?

766
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,992
哦 那可说来话长了
Oh, that's a long story.

767
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,763
你是85师 那个大规模杀伤性武器搜寻部队 对吧?
You're in the 85th. That's WMD unit, right?

768
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:44,733
你怎么知道的?
How did you know that?

769
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,571
不就写在你步枪上面么
It's right there on your rifle.

770
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:50,238
我是Lawrie Dayne 华尔街日报的 搜查进行得如何?
Lawrie Dayne, Wall Street Journal, How's it going?

771
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,310
你知道的 我们什么都没找到 嘿 Perry中士 
You know, we haven't found shit yet. Hey, Sergeant Perry.

772
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,376
一定会找到的 多少有点沮丧 不是么?
We'll find it. It's frustrating, right?

773
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,580
是有一点
Little bit.

774
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,488
刚才你跟Marty谈什么啊?
So what are you and Marty talking about?

775
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,856
哦 你该知道 我可不能跟你说那些
Oh, you know I can't talk to you about that.

776
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,417
哦 得了吧
Oh, come on.

777
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,659
你风尘仆仆地从战场跑来只是为了跟Martin Brown喝杯柠檬汽水?
You come in fresh off the field to have a lemonade with Martin Brown?

778
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,064
肯定是有什么事
Something's gotta be going on.

779
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,834
那你可以问他啊
Well, you could ask him.

780
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,201
我可是在问你
I'm asking you.

781
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,673
我们至今一无所获 你没觉得有问题吗?
Does it make sense to you that we're still coming up empty?

782
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,371
没有 没问题
No. No, it doesn't.

783
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,839
有人给我们说那儿有武器 对吧?
Someone told us they were there, right?

784
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,179
如果有什么发现
If you come across anything,

785
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,447
打给我
call me.

786
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,963
行 我记住了
I'll keep it in mind.

787
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:10,963
内部人士证实伊拉克有大规模杀伤武器计划

788
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:20,963
一位代号为"Magellan"的伊拉克高官

789
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:27,963
爆出令人震惊的伊拉克大规模杀伤武器计划

790
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:32,563
"Magellan" 说出了几个地点

791
00:47:33,995 --> 00:47:38,263
位于迪瓦尼亚的肉毒杆菌毒素

792
00:47:38,995 --> 00:47:42,263
曼索尔的地下存储网络

793
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:48,263
据信"Magellan"在一个秘密地点会见了一名美国高官

794
00:47:48,995 --> 00:47:57,163
但具体细节仍属高度机密 

795
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,012
他躲到哪去了? Al Rawi在哪啊?
Where's he hiding? Where's Al Rawi?

796
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,654
Al Rawi在哪啊?
Where's Al Rawi?

797
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,525
问了多久?
How long have they been going?

798
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,855
10分钟左右吧
For about 10 minutes.

799
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,453
你还想见到你的妻子和小孩吗? 你有五个孩子
You want to see your wife and kids again? You have five kids,

800
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,122
你还想让他们看见自己的父亲吗?
You want them to see their father?

801
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,101
他说"求你了 不要把我的家人牵扯进来"
He says, "Please, do not involve my family in this situation,"

802
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,695
"我对天发誓..."
"I swear to God..."

803
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,366
一旦你被扯进来了 你家人也就被扯进来了
You're involved, so your family's involved,

804
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,274
我只要你回答我 这个男人在哪
All I want is an answer, where to look for this man,

805
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,676
我就让你走
and you can walk out of here,

806
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,408
- Al Rawi在哪?  - Al Rawi在哪?
- Where's Al Rawi?  - Where's Al Rawi?

807
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,280
把名字或地址告诉我
And I want a name or an address,

808
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:44,618
告诉我在哪能找到Al Rawi将军
Somewhere I can find General Al Rawi,

809
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,747
我需要一个回答
I am going to get an answer,

810
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,883
而你也明白要告诉我点什么
and you know you're going to tell me something,

811
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,397
好吧 只要你告诉我一个地址 我就马上放你走
All right, I'm going to let go and you're going to give me an address,

812
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,231
Al Rawi在哪? 他到底在哪?
Where's Al Rawi? Where is he?

813
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,135
那本书! 那本书!
The book! The book!

814
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,864
他说你需要一本书
He says you need the book,

815
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,339
又是那该死的书? 书里有什么?
The fucking book again? What's in the book?

816
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,706
"那本书 它能帮你找到他"
"The book, that's how you'll find him,"

817
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,338
书上有Al Rawi藏身处的名称和地点 
It has the names and locations of Al Rawi's safe houses,

818
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,388
Miller准尉在吗?
Chief Miller around?

819
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,194
在 上楼右转就是
Yeah. Up the stairs, down on the right.

820
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:44,505
嘿 准尉 我是Clark Poundstone 五角大楼特殊情报局的
Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone, Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.

821
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,606
抓Hamza干得可是真漂亮啊
A great job bagging Hamza.

822
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,477
谢谢 非常感谢
Thanks. Appreciate it.

823
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,076
边走边说?
Walk you out?

824
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,879
好的
Sure.

825
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,955
- 你是咱们机动执行组部队的 对吧?  - 是的
- You're with our MET Team, right?  - Yeah.

826
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,993
管理层非常感激你们所做的工作
Well, the administration really appreciates the work you guys are doing.

827
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,187
我们得把这个大规模杀伤性武器的事情往后放一放
We gotta get this WMD issue behind us

828
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,129
这样才能迎接未来更为重要的挑战
so we can get on with the challenges of the future.

829
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,894
这个Hamza正好能够帮上忙
That's where this Hamza guy could be helpful.

830
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,764
他向我们供认了一些事实
He's confirmed a few facts for us.

831
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,135
还说你们好像捡到了他掉的一个笔记本
Says your guys might have lifted a notebook from him.

832
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,868
但是 我从他身上得到的东西可都给了Martin Brown
Well, everything I got off him I gave to Martin Brown.

833
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,569
你为什么不去问问看他拿了没?
Why don't you ask him if he's got it?

834
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,133
我可不认为Marty会那么做
I don't think Marty would go for that.

835
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,612
他是个了不起的人 但也是在中东待了很久
He's a hell of a guy, but he's been in the Middle East a long time.

836
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,149
有很多的成见
He's got a lot of preconceived ideas.

837
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,378
我们局正努力寻找着第一手情报
Our unit's trying to get back to the raw intel.

838
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,680
你看 我可不是想说Marty的坏话
Look, I don't want to throw Marty under a bus,

839
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,552
但是他不喜欢我们提出的意见
but he doesn't like what we're coming up with.

840
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,681
那家伙不合时宜
The guy's a dinosaur,

841
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,250
但是我们需要更多的信息
and we need to get some new thinking going on around here.

842
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:34,229
我这有个机会给你 Mliier
There's an opportunity for you here, Miller.

843
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,730
我知道Marty暂时把你调了进来
I know Marty's pulled you in temporarily,

844
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,735
但是如果你想待得更长更久的话 我能帮上你
but if you're looking for something more permanent, I can help.

845
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,929
我们做的可是好事 我可是准备要重建这个地区
We're doing a good thing here. We're going to rebuild this place.

846
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,976
人民可都在看着我们啊
People are watching us.

847
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,439
行 我记住了
I'll keep it in mind.

848
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,846
一定要记好
You do that.

849
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,842
如果你有了笔记本的消息 转告我一声啊
If you hear anything about that notebook, let me know.

850
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,170
你一位在五角大楼的朋友来找过我
Your friend from the Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit came to see me.

851
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:05,233
Poundstone吗?
Poundstone?

852
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:06,539
是的 Poundstone
Yeah, Poundstone.

853
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:10,174
你们之前追踪的大规模杀伤性武器情报都是Poundstone的人提供的
Poundstone's unit pushed all that WMD intel you've been chasing your tail on.

854
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,911
什么? 你是说Magellan?
What? You mean Magellan?

855
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,680
Magellan是谁? 你跟他见过面吗?
Who is Magellan? Have you ever met him?

856
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:14,845
没见过
No.

857
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:16,684
Poundstone把他关得紧紧的
Poundstone's got him locked up tight.

858
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:19,691
这就是我们得把它调查清楚的原因
That's why we gotta find out what's going on.

859
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:21,019
情况是这样的
Here's the deal.

860
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:22,220
我们调查过了笔记本
We checked the notebook.

861
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:24,889
上面记录着巴格达附近的地址 主要在Adhamiya那块
It's a list of addresses around Baghdad, mostly Adhamiya.

862
00:51:24,964 --> 00:51:27,956
那是个伊斯兰逊尼派教徒的大本营 同情军队
It's a Sunni stronghold, very sympathetic to the army.

863
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,093
十有八九 Al Rawi就躲在那
More than likely, that's where Al Rawi is.

864
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,570
那个笔记本也许就是他和他部下联系的方式
The notebook's probably his line to his battalion commanders.

865
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:33,663
都准备好了吗?
We all set?

866
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,537
还没 我们正在等军队的支持
Not yet. We're waiting on military support.

867
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:39,044
使劲催他们 我要那本书上的每个地址都被搜查到
Push them hard. I want to get every address in that book.

868
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:40,670
那么 你觉得那个会议在讨论些什么?
So, what do you think that meeting was about?

869
00:51:40,747 --> 00:51:43,215
你要是被入侵了 会第一时间讨论什么呢?
What would you be talking about if you just got invaded?

870
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:45,478
你觉得Al Rawi想开战?
You think Al Rawi wants to fight?

871
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,816
如果我们不给他谈条件的话 就会的
If we don't make him an offer, he will.

872
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:49,878
什么? 你们想跟他协商条件?
What? You're going to cut a deal?

873
00:51:49,956 --> 00:51:53,119
你们想跟梅花J来谈条件?
You're going to cut a deal with the Jack of Clubs?

874
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,455
你觉得你来这都是为了什么 Miller?
What do you think you're doing here, Miller?

875
00:51:56,529 --> 00:51:58,463
你为了一个目标而来的这里 什么目标? 
You're off reservation for a reason. What is it?

876
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:01,500
我来这是为了找武器救人命的
Well, I came to find weapons and save lives.

877
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:03,365
但是我什么也没找到
And I didn't find shit.

878
00:52:03,436 --> 00:52:05,063
我想知道为什么
I want to know why.

879
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:08,107
这不是一两句话就能说清楚的 想要简单答案的话 你找Poundstone去好了
There are no easy answers. If you want that, go work with Poundstone.

880
00:52:08,174 --> 00:52:10,165
我们有的只是艰难的抉择
All we got is hard choices.

881
00:52:10,243 --> 00:52:11,835
你想要知道武器情报是怎么回事吗?
You want to know what happened to the weapons?

882
00:52:12,245 --> 00:52:14,179
我们得把Al Rawi找到 并把他带过来
We gotta find Al Rawi and bring him in.

883
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:15,908
他会告诉我们大规模杀伤性武器的真相
He'll give us the truth about WMD

884
00:52:15,982 --> 00:52:20,112
还有怎样才能避免大屠杀并且重建好这个国家
and give us a shot at standing this country up without a bloodbath.

885
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:22,981
你干还是不干?
Do you want the job or not?

886
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:27,983
- 好吧 我干  - 很好
- Yeah, I want it.  - Good.

887
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:32,193
Hamza被关在Cropper兵营的要犯区
Hamza's being held at the high-value target wing at Camp Cropper.

888
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:34,199
Poundstone的人把他藏匿起来了
Poundstone's unit have him under wraps.

889
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:36,701
那么 你想怎样把他给找出来?
So, how are you going to get to him?

890
00:52:36,769 --> 00:52:38,464
不是我找 是你找
I'm not. You are.

891
00:52:39,205 --> 00:52:40,536
这是通行证
Here's a pass.

892
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:44,407
我们在那有另外一个犯人 你能利用他进去
We've got another prisoner there we can use to get you in.

893
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:47,537
他只是个低级别的共和国卫队 他们不会注意的
Low-level Republican Guard, way below their radar.

894
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:50,481
利用他作为借口 接近Hamza
Use him as an excuse to get to Hamza.

895
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,415
这里有一百万美元的现金
Here's a million dollars in cash.

896
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:55,113
告诉他 只要他告诉我们 钱就是他的了
Tell Hamza the money's his if he gives us what we need.

897
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:58,121
你告诉他 只要告诉我Al Rawi在哪
You tell him if he gives Al Rawi to me,

898
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:00,785
不过在我找到Al Rawi之前别说出来
keeps his mouth shut over there until I bring him in,

899
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,626
这周末我会把他和他的家人弄出国
I'll have him and his family out of the country by the end of the week.

900
00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:07,689
你要我告诉他别对美国审讯人招供?
You want me to tell him to not talk to the American interrogators?

901
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,291
对 
That's right.

902
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:14,533
我以为我们都是一条船上的呢
I thought we were all on the same side.

903
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,199
别幼稚了
Don't be naive.

904
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:41,961
Miller啊
Miller.

905
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:44,432
五角大楼刚刚取消了的调令
Pentagon just revoked your transfer.

906
00:53:44,504 --> 00:53:48,463
遣返你回你原来的部队 即刻生效
You're being released back to your unit, effective immediately.

907
00:53:49,742 --> 00:53:51,801
你站错队了
You chose the wrong side.

908
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,449
跟我来 Freddy 我们得快点行动
Follow me, Freddy. We gotta move fast.

909
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:03,981
你们以为你们这是去哪?
Where do you think you're going?

910
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:07,117
让我们过去 请让开
Let us through. Step aside, please.

911
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:13,226

913

白宫授权 我要笔记本
White House authorization. I want the book.

914
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:31,610
这个对华盛顿太重要了 不能被你和一些复兴党将军搞砸了
DC's got too much riding on this to have you and some Ba'athist generals fuck it up.

915
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:33,881

922
00:55:36,144 --> 00:55:40,006

00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:46,579
"为了自己 为了你的家人 为了你的国家 请合作"

924
00:55:50,763 --> 00:55:52,754
跟紧我 Freddy
Stay close to me, Freddy.

925
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,526
把他弄下来
Put him down.

932
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:21,023
这伊斯兰教徒是谁?
What's up with Hajji?

933
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:22,857
他是我的翻译
He's my translator.

934
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,066
胳膊抬起 腿分开
Arms up, legs apart.

935
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:41,640

Check it out.

936
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:43,511

937
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,346
香烟
It's my cigarettes.

938
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:48,683
- 没问题  - 给你 长官
- Good to go.  - Here you go, sir.

00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:51,349

Go ahead and take them back to IR-1.

940
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:08,540
就是这儿
Right here.

941
00:57:30,263 --> 00:57:31,890
没必要这样 中士 
That's not necessary, Sergeant.

942
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:33,898
标准程序 长官
Standard procedure, sir.

943
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:43,298
中士 我和囚犯的谈话属于机密
Sergeant, I have to have a classified conversation with the prisoner.

944
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,570
你可以先出去等着
You can go on and step outside.

945
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:47,044
是的 长官 我在外面等着
Roger, sir. Be right outside.

946
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:13,299
你知道为什么他们把他抓到这儿吗?
Do you know why they brought him here?

947
00:58:15,975 --> 00:58:19,411
因为他是共和国护卫队的 Freddy
He's here because he's in the Republican Guard, Freddy.

948
00:58:19,712 --> 00:58:21,304
嘿 中士

949
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:24,682

他能帮我指认他

952
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,682
我得把他弄到这儿来 快速指认一下
I gotta get him down here and ID him real quick.

953
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:34,351

You're going to need an EJ-75 for that, man.

954
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,485
伙计 我现在有一项军事行动
Guys, I got a live op going.

有一队士兵待命等着朝目标前进呢 我现在就得进行
I got a team in place ready to move on a target. I gotta do this now.

956
00:58:38,064 --> 00:58:39,053
要花多长时间?
How long will it take?

957
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:40,155
两分钟
Two minutes.

958
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:42,292
- 就两分钟?  - 就是这样 两分钟而已 拜托

把套子套在他们头上
Put those bags on their heads.

961

中情局来确认一下身份

966
00:59:33,185 --> 00:59:34,880
我说 叫医生来!
I said, get a medic!

967
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:39,188
嘿 打电话叫医生 我们这有情况
Hey, get the medics on the phone. We've got a situation here.

他说 "你们为什么要这么对我?"
He say, "Why did you do this to me?"

什么会面?
What meeting?

让开! 让开!
Clear the way! Clear the way!

974
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,709
这儿怎么了 Miller?
What is going on here, Miller?

975
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:08,777
过来! 好的
Coming through! Okay.

976
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:12,286
他说"约旦"是什么意思?
What does he mean, "Jordan"?

977
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:20,895
得赶紧止血 他的脉搏太弱了
We gotta stop the bleeding. His pulse is weak.

978
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:03,536
准备好了吗?

979
01:01:12,774 --> 01:01:15,190
我们5分钟后吃饭

980
01:01:28,356 --> 01:01:29,918
Mohammed Al Rawi在那里?

981
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:32,134
我不知道

982
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:38,161
我要跟你谈谈Magellan的事
I need to talk to you about Magellan.

983
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:42,371
我一会给你打回去
I'm going to call you right back.

984
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:44,876
你知道什么了?
What you got?

985
01:02:47,113 --> 01:02:48,637
我看了你的文章
I read your articles.

986
01:02:48,714 --> 01:02:51,683
你说在战争之前有个叫Magellan的伊拉克大规模杀伤性武器
You said an Iraqi WMD source named Magellan

987
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:54,345
的情报线人和美国军官会面
met with US officials prior to the war.

988
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,149
我要知道那次会面的情况
I need to know about that meeting.

989
01:02:56,222 --> 01:02:59,487
噢 不 拜托 Miller 我不能跟你说我线人的情况
Oh, no. Come on, Miller. I can't discuss my sources with you.

990
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:03,460
那 你见过那个人吗? 你知道他是谁吗?
Well, did you ever meet the guy? Do you know who he is?

991
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:07,124
我当然没见过他 天呐 他是个伊拉克人 
Of course I didn't meet him. He's an Iraqi internal, for Christ's sake.

992
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,259
那你怎么知道他说的是真的?
Then how do you know what he's saying is true?

993
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:15,301
因为我通过一个可靠的中介人联系他
Because I made contact through a reliable intermediary.

994
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,932
- 可靠?  - 对
- Reliable?  - Yes.

995
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:22,143
那你去过Magellan提供的地点吗?
Have you ever even been to any of Magellan's sites?

996
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,183
你去过迪瓦尼亚吗? 提克里特呢?
You ever been to Diwaniya? Tikrit?

997
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,880
没
No.

998
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:30,080
那儿什么都没有
There's nothing there.

999
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,624
Magellan的情报是扯淡
Magellan's intel is bullshit.

1000
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,689
中介人是谁?
Who's the intermediary?

1001
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:40,664
不 我不会说我线人的情况 Miller
No. I'm not discussing sources, Miller.

1002
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,793
上帝啊! 这可是我们开战的原因!
Jesus Christ! This is the reason we went to war!

1003
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,139
好吧 那至少告诉我这事怎么回事
All right, then at least tell me how it happened.

1004
01:03:53,212 --> 01:03:54,270
这是怎么发生的?
How does this happen?

1005
01:03:54,346 --> 01:03:57,645
像你这样的人怎么会写出那些不实的报道来?
How does somebody like you write something that's not true?

1006
01:03:57,716 --> 01:03:59,013
告诉我!
Tell me!

1007
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,815
你知道些什么?
What do you know?

1008
01:04:09,328 --> 01:04:14,960
有一天我接到一个华盛顿高官的电话
Look, I got a phone call one day from a senior official in DC.

1009
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:18,063
他说 "我有个新闻"
He says, "I've got a story for you."

1010
01:04:18,137 --> 01:04:20,833
"萨达姆大规模杀伤性武器计划的真相"
"The truth about Saddam's WMD programs."

1011
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,937
于是我就见了他
So I go to meet him.

1012
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,506
他把线人的情报放到我手里
He puts the source report in my hands.

1013
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:29,647
Magellan的报告 原始情报
Magellan's product, the raw intel.

1014
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:32,981
那你什么时候检查情报真实性的?
But when do you check the story?

1015
01:04:35,921 --> 01:04:38,151
天呐 他可是高级官员
He was a senior official, for Christ's sake.

1016
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:40,818
他有权直接盘问Magellan
He had access to Magellan's debrief.

1017
01:04:40,893 --> 01:04:45,023
他要求的就是我不能公开会议的地点
All he asked was that I not disclose the location of the meeting.

1018
01:04:46,332 --> 01:04:47,356
地点
The location.

1019
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:49,799
对 以防危害到线人
Yes, in case I'd compromise the source.

1020
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:53,630
是约旦 对吗?
It was Jordan, wasn't it?

1021
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:57,100
会议在约旦进行的
The meeting was in Jordan.

1022
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,808
对
Yes.

1023
01:05:16,328 --> 01:05:18,796
你可以留着你的百万美金了
You can keep your million dollars.

1024
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:21,062
Al Rawi就是Magellan
Al Rawi's Magellan.

1025
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:25,896
他们在盘问Magellan 他们严密关着他呢
They're debriefing Magellan. They've got him held tight.

1026
01:05:26,305 --> 01:05:28,205
假如他们没有呢?
Supposing they don't?

1027
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,708
John 把钱收好
John, take care of the money.

1028
01:05:34,246 --> 01:05:37,340
Hamza说Al Rawi在约旦会见了美国官员
Hamza said Al Rawi met US officials in Jordan.

1029
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:39,145
Dayne说Magellan在约旦会见了美国官员
Now Dayne said the same thing about Magellan.

1030
01:05:39,451 --> 01:05:41,214
这不仅仅是巧合
That's more than a coincidence.

1031
01:05:41,287 --> 01:05:43,949
有可能 可是说不通啊
Maybe. It doesn't make any sense.

1032
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,751
如果Poundstone在约旦见了Al Rawi 那他隐瞒什么啊?
If Poundstone met Al Rawi in Jordan, what's he hiding?

1033
01:05:46,825 --> 01:05:50,420
那 要是他告诉他一些他不想听到的事呢?
Well, what if he told him something he didn't wanna hear?

1034
01:05:50,496 --> 01:05:53,158
如果他告诉他根本没有大规模杀伤性武器呢?
What if he told him there were no WMD?

1035
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,728
我要Al Rawi在伊拉克境外的行动记录
I want Al Rawi's movements outside Iraq.

我在查
I'm on it.

1038
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:07,111
这就完全说通了 假情报
It all makes sense. The bad intel.

1039
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:09,545
为什么我们在那些地点什么都没发现
Why our teams came up empty at those sites.

1040
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:12,846
也许我们看错了
Maybe we're looking at this thing the wrong way around.

1041
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,476
这只是猜想
It's a theory.

1042
01:06:15,854 --> 01:06:16,980
没真凭实据
You've got no proof.

1043
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,455
别幼稚了
Don't be naive.

1211
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:05,521
和一位美国官员接触过
in the weeks leading up to the war.

1212

我想你已经准备好告诉他们 伊拉克的大规模杀伤性武器计划
I know you were ready to tell them everything about Iraq's WMD programs.

我告诉过你们的官员

我们在91年后之后撤除了所有计划

1221
01:24:52,236 --> 01:24:55,637
Miller先生 你的政府希望听到这个谎言 
Your government wanted to hear the lie, Mr. Miller.

1222
01:24:57,308 --> 01:25:02,871
他们想铲除萨达姆 用尽一切手段

将军 要是你跟我走
General, if you come in with me,

1234
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:04,872
在华盛顿同样有人愿意跟你合作
there are still people in Washington who will work with you.

1235
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:09,672
人们清楚美国仍需要伊拉克军队的帮助
People who understand that we still need the Iraqi army

1236
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:11,237
同心协力 共同建设
to hold this place together.

1237
01:26:11,315 --> 01:26:14,443
那为什么你的政府要解散伊拉克军队?
Then why is your government disbanding the Army?

1238
01:26:15,153 --> 01:26:16,950
宣布我们不合法
Making us outlaws.

1239
01:26:18,055 --> 01:26:21,582
又为什么要把伊拉克弄的分崩离析?

1240
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,220
到底是为什么?
Why?

1241
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:31,099
我冒着生命危险
I risked my life

1242
01:26:32,336 --> 01:26:34,861
说出大规模杀伤性武器的事实真相
to tell you the truth about WMD.

1243
01:26:36,007 --> 01:26:40,307
你们说: "说真话就新伊拉克就有你们一席之地"
"Tell the truth and you'll have a place in the new Iraq," they said.

1244
01:26:41,579 --> 01:26:44,571
那么Miller先生 我的一席之地在哪?
So where is my place, Mr. Miller?

1245
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,649
在扑克牌上吗?
On a deck of cards?

1246
01:27:35,766 --> 01:27:38,234
Miller 你到底来干什么?
Why are you really here, Miller?

1247
01:27:07,325 --> 01:27:08,325
美国人来了！

1249
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:41,871
你是来设计抓我的
You were supposed to lead me into a trap.

1250
01:27:43,574 --> 01:27:47,704
告诉我 他们准备怎么抓我
You will tell me now how they are planning to take me.

1251
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,507

1256
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:17,765
你反击我们 只会一败涂地
You will get nothing if you fight us.

1257
01:28:20,578 --> 01:28:23,547
你现在跟我走 还为时不晚
You have to come in now before it's too late.

1258
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:26,674
就因为你们占领了巴格达
You think the war is over

1259
01:28:27,985 --> 01:28:30,579
你们就认为这场战争都结束了?
just because you are in Baghdad?

1260
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:33,481
你会明白
You will see.

1261
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,049

你认为大家都会听你的?

1345
01:42:05,902 --> 01:42:08,132
当你在华盛顿散播谣言 他们就知道那是骗人的?
When you peddled that shit in DC, did they know it was a lie?

1346
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:09,536
又或者只是他们都懒得去核实?

你到底知不知道你干了什么?
Do you have any idea what you've done here?

1354
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:30,885
要是下次我们需要人民的信任 那要怎么办?
What's going to happen next time we need people to trust us?

1360
01:42:54,254 --> 01:42:56,194
这让人难以接受!

1361
01:42:56,199 --> 01:42:58,099
不支持就滚开!

1362
01:42:58,796 --> 01:43:00,496
拜托 先生们!

1363
