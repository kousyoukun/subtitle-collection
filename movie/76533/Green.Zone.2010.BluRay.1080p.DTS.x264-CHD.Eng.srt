1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:26,000


3
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,658
More airwaves silent and most explosions in the Iraqi capital.

4
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,966
Further explosions are unfolding in Tikrit,

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,701
which is Saddam Hussein's ancestral hometown,

6
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,107
as well as blows from similar explosions are unfolding...

7
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:50,582
Just a few seconds ago, another huge blast shook this city,

8
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,682
cruise missiles and airstrikes raining down here

9
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,621
in a relentless assault on Baghdad.

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,148
There is no doubt tonight that war has begun...

11
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,663
and the Iraqi capital is experiencing shock and awe.

12
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:15,880


13
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,199


14
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:26,288


15
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:30,890


16
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:36,247


17
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:48,478


18
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:57,347


19
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:08,999


20
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:11,947


21
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:13,847


22
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:45,899


23
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,800
Approaching target site three-five-niner.

24
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,000
All right, everybody, listen up.

25
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,012
It is a military storage site. Diwaniya.

26
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,011
Intel estimates possible nerve agents, choking agents,

27
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,609
live pathogens, chemical-tipped missiles.

28
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,247
101st has been here all morning, so the site is secure.

29
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,848
Everybody stay focused. This is it.

30
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,835
Shots fired, right side, 100 meters, sir.

31
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,839
We got shots fired. Right side, 100 meters.

32
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,184
Let's go. Move. Move!

33
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,683
Okay. Go ahead.

34
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,584
Who's the officer in charge?

35
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,718
Move! Move! Move!

36
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,285
Hey! Who's in charge?

37
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,796
Right here. Lieutenant Asira.

38
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,922
Chief Miller, Met-Delta.

39
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,830
What the fuck are all these looters doing here?

40
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,064
This is a WMD site. This is a high-priority site.

41
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,833
Look, I don't even have enough men to set up the perimeter.

42
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,738
We got a sniper in this tower right here.

43
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,003
In the big tower on the back?

44
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,101
In the big tower on the back.

45
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,113
I do not have enough men to go in and secure the inside of that compound.

46
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,810
Listen, listen. Intel says we got live chemical agents in this site.

47
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,079
Okay, we gotta move now! These looters...

48
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,519
I don't know what these people are carrying out right now.

49
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,557
I gotta get into this site. I'm going in.

50
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,058
Chief, you can't go in.

51
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,651
If you take your team in right now, it's on you.

52
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,823
Gather around. Gather around. Come on. Listen, here's the situation.

53
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,492
101st sent 35 men and one butter bar down here.

54
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,331
They don't even have this place secure, so

55
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,768
here's where we are right now.

56
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,568
Now, the weapons are in the northwest end of the complex.

57
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,905
There's a sniper holed up in the big tower there.

58
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,807
We're going to have to quickly take him out.

59
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,041
I'm going to take a recon element forward. I'm going to need C-BIST.

60
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,639
- Marshall and Johnson, you come with me.  - Yes, sir.

61
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,685
Two shooters, Potts, Michaels. I'm going to need EOD.

62
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,152
- Conway, bring Simms also.  - Right here, sir.

63
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,052
- Ready, Chief.  - All right, stand by.

64
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,385
Chief, I gotta talk to you. This is fucked.

65
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,790
Listen, this is a disaster.

66
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,886
It is a disaster. They haven't secured dick.

67
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,727
I don't think we should go in yet, Chief. Let's get some acceptable intel.

68
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,893
No, no, no. Look at this! Jerry, I got no idea what's coming out here.

69
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,869
I gotta go right now.

70
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,571
Keep comms open. I'll be on five.

71
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,630
Get a second team ready.

72
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,270
Let's go! Move! Move!

73
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,833
Guys, get that shit off the truck now.

74
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,776
Roger that.

75
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,870
- C-BIST?  - Right here, Chief.

76
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,347
I want you to stay right on the backs of your shooters, all right?

77
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,112
- They will take you in.  - Roger that, Chief.

78
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,209
All right. We ready?

79
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,413
- Yes, sir!  - Let's go. Go! Go! Go!

80
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,189
Move! Move!

81
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,058
The sniper! Hey, Sarge! Where is he?

82
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,585
He's right up there, but we can't get down the alley.

83
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,674
Okay, everyone, listen up.

84
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,541
Michaels! Michaels, listen. Hey!

85
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:51,046
The WMD are in this building. I need you to work your way to the rear door here.

86
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,744
See if you can get an angle on that sniper.

87
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,310
I want you to take C-BIST with you. Take Simms, also, with the long rifle.

88
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,514
Got it, Chief.

89
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,489
Hey, I gotta get across this alley.

90
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,752
I need some cover fire, all right?

91
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,884
Okay.

92
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,418
When the 203 goes, we're going to go all the way down on the left side.

93
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,759
- All right. Stand by.  - Roger that, Chief.

94
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,992
Let's go.

95
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,499
Met-Delta team, go!

96
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,772
Move, move! Let's go!

97
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,035
Move! Move!

98
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,730
I got him, He's on the fifth floor, southeast corner room,

99
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,565
I'm going to draw him out.

100
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,660
As soon as you see him, take him.

101
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,726
Roger.

102
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,038
Now! Now! Now!

103
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,280
Got him?

104
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,291
We got him. Three coming out.

105
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,724
Michaels, send C-BIST over.

106
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,227
Go! Go! Go!

107
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,633
Potts, Keating, go! Go!

108
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,837
Second team, move! Let's go! Move! Move!

109
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,272
Move it!

110
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,504
In.

111
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,708
Check. Check. Let's do it.

112
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,381
All right. Break out the gear. I want everyone in full MOPP.

113
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,858
Now you heard Chief. Get ready. Roll those seals tight.

114
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,821
I got it.

115
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,527
No readings in here, Chief.

116
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,535
All right, Conway, open it up,

117
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,647
Nothing but toilet parts over here.

118
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,558
Is this all pigeon shit?

119
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,495
Yeah, thing looks like it's been here about 10 years.

120
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,553
Yep.

121
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,134
This is no WMD site.

122
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,838
Pack it up.

123
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,203
Hey, Chief, we find anything?

124
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,404
The site's empty.

125
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,479
Standing by,

126
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,452
Hey, where did that intel come from?

127
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,362
Do you want me to double check the target number for you? Because I can.

128
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,524
No, no, we're in the right location. The schematic's right.

129
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,431
But who did it originate with? I mean...

130
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,629
Hey, did this come from the United Nations?

131
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,867
According to this data, Chief, this is our intel.

132
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,841
Yeah, but how would they think something was there?

133
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,444
This is the third straight time.

134
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,642
Let's go.

135
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,481
You heard the chief. Move out.

136
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,353
All right, pack this shit up and let's go.

137
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,411
Roger that!

138
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,081
Let's go! Move!

139
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,487
Step on it. Let's go.

140
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:06,101


141
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,401
Zubaidi will be on the middle chopper. Get tight on his exit.

142
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,722
Swing it around. Swing it around.

143
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,555
The DOD guy's here to meet him.

144
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,026
Reporting to you live from the tarmac here...

145
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,836
Ready for the close-up? Go, go, go!

146
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,398
That's Poundstone from DOD.

147
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,169
How's it going?

148
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,977
Great day.

149
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,514
Yup, you finally got him here.

150
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,950
Well, we feel like we're making progress. That's important.

151
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,079
So, what about the weapons?

152
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,651
I'm frustrated by that, too.

153
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,726
We're doing everything we can. We'll find the weapons, don't worry about it.

154
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,855
The whole world's watching. They want to know where they are.

155
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,661
Make sure Zubaidi and I are in the lead car, okay?

156
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:09,996
Jack, I want your guys to tail us.

157
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,093
You got it, sir.

158
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,501
- Clark!  - What?

159
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,198
I need the source. I need Magellan.

160
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,110
Do you have any idea how sensitive this is?

161
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,882
We've got Magellan locked up so tight, I'm not even sure I can get to him.

162
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:28,113
You're the administration's go-to guy and you can't access your own source?

163
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,212
Lawrie, we're debriefing him.

164
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,280
It takes time. That comes first.

165
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,393
For Christ's sake, I've given you everything I got on the guy so far.

166
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,225
- What more do you want?  - I don't want to hear it from you,

167
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,322
I want to hear it from him.

168
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,324
I'll see what I can do.

169
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,470
How are you?

170
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,699
- Welcome home, sir.  - We'll make this very brief.

171
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,538
How does it feel to be back, Mr. Zubaidi?

172
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,339
Did you ever think you'd see this day?

173
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,405
I'm an Iraqi citizen, returning free to the city of my birth.

174
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:02,011
I call on all Iraqis to celebrate our liberation from tyranny.

175
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,559
Bravo one, we've got two mechanics taking a look at it,

176
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,687
Tracking on the upgun is pretty well shot

177
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,755
and the comm links are all shorted out,

178
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,097
What's the time frame on a replacement?

179
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,447
I want a squad list, now!

180
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,611
Hey, where's Colonel Bethel?

181
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,811
He's in the back, Chief.

182
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,183
Thank you.

183
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,619
Roy, let me meet you over here, okay?

184
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,351
Yeah, I'll meet you in there.

185
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,524
- Hey, sir.  - Good to see you, Chief.

186
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,994
What's going on with the intel?

187
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,553
You don't want to get into that right now.

188
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,498
Well, we gotta talk about it. There's nothing there. These sites are empty.

189
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,591
We're going to be very careful,

190
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,693
or there's going to be a huge shitstorm around here.

191
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,760
What do you mean?

192
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,567
They're blaming us for not moving fast enough.

193
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,664
We have to stay on task.

194
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,574
That's bullshit. The intel's no good.

195
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,268
Let's not make any waves, okay?

196
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,246
They don't want to hear that back in Washington.

197
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,579
All they're interested in is finding something they can hold up on CNN.

198
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,017
Sir, but we gotta talk about this. The intel is a problem.

199
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,816
Now is not the time, Chief.

200
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,621
Roo! On your feet!

201
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,957
Take your seats, people.

202
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,627
We're here this morning to give the General

203
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,332
a check on where we are in our search for WMD

204
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,932
and what our plans are for the next 48 hours.

205
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,878
To that end, I'm turning the floor over to Captain Jonathan Vaught.

206
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,471
Captain. Sir.

207
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,714
Welcome, sir.

208
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,447
Today we're going to be briefing you on WMD operations due to take place

209
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,820
in and around the Baghdad area over the next 24 hours.

210
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,818
We're continuing to target high-priority sites,

211
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,227
since all the folks back home are anxiously awaiting the information

212
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,027
that we found these weapons.

213
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,668
We have a detailed media plan we've worked out.

214
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,862
We've coordinated with the public-affairs folks.

215
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,429
We have a good plan that involves the top-rated media

216
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,168
in the United States and the UK

217
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,178
so that they're prepared to cover all aspects of the good news.

218
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,146
- Yeah?  - I had a couple questions

219
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,207
about the intel for tomorrow.

220
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,445
Are we sure this is accurate?

221
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,681
It's solid. It's good to go.

222
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,746
What's the source?

223
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,019
Well, it's a human-source intel.

224
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,262
But it's solid. It's current as of 0400.

225
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,393
Was it the same source we've been using?

226
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,402
Every site we've hit on the way up here, we've rolled a donut.

227
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,101
Chief, how about we do this? Let's talk offline.

228
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,302
Give me a list of the places where you went, and the grids,

229
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,470
and we'll make sure that you had the right information written down

230
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,604
and that you went to the right places, okay?

231
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,309
Captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir. The issue's that there's nothing there.

232
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,545
Stand down, Chief. We need to move on here.

233
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,750
Don, hold on. Hold a second. Let's hear what the chief has to say.

234
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,082
Okay, sir, I'll give you an example.

235
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,821
We rolled into a site, Diwaniya, last week, okay?

236
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,558
101st took casualties securing it for us.

237
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,499
We got in there and found it was a toilet factory.

238
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,933
I'm saying there's a disconnect

239
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:08,167
between what's in these packets and what we're seeing on the ground.

240
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,804
There's a problem with the intelligence, sir.

241
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,605
Here's the thing, Chief.

242
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,374
These intelligence packages have all been vetted.

243
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,880
They're good.

244
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,544
Your job's to execute them, not worry about how they're put together.

245
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,519
Are we clear on that?

246
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,113
Yes, sir.

247
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,419
Good. Let's continue.

248
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,359
Sir, as I was saying, the intel is as recent as 0400 this morning.

249
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,625
It's actionable and it's solid.

250
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,597
All right, next up is Al Mansour, Baghdad.

251
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,571
It looks like it's some kind of underground storage site.

252
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,005
You got about 12 klicks of open highway to the city,

253
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,337
but there's a lot of activity on that road,

254
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,344
so tell everybody to keep their heads up.

255
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,470
All right.

256
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,638
Chief?

257
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,443
All right. We're going to go chem. Yeah?

258
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,574
I'm gonna get all the lead teams up, all right?

259
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,708
Yeah, yeah.

260
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,445
Martin Brown, CIA.

261
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,748
Roy Miller.

262
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,982
Yeah, I know. I saw you at the meeting.

263
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,457
You're going to the Al Mansour site in Baghdad.

264
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,084
- Yeah.  - You're wasting your time.

265
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,462
UN biological team hit it two months ago.

266
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,554
There's nothing there.

267
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,893
Fuck me.

268
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,601
Here's my card. You're right.

269
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,760
This thing doesn't add up.

270
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,170
The Iraqis don't fight, they don't use WMD,

271
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,573
they let us walk in here and find the goddamn cupboard's bare.

272
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,407
There's something wrong here.

273
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,572
We gotta figure out what it is.

274
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,542
If you find anything, you've got my number.

275
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,634
That's affirmative, That's affirmative,

276
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,265
We took on some fire about four klicks back,

277
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,838
pretty light, though, nothing to worry about.

278
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,986
Oh, I gotta get some pictures of this.

279
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,583
Be my guest.

280
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,089
Heads up. Incoming.

281
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,791
Fucking Potts, you red-headed dick.

282
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,275
Hey, Wilkins, this is Chief. Get up here.

283
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,643
Hold on!

284
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,313
Yo, Kurry, let's go.

285
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,081
Please, get back. Please.

286
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,486
I want you to get a couple of the guys and clear out this traffic.

287
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,990
We're too exposed out here. We gotta keep moving.

288
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,289
Back from the truck. Sir, take it easy.

289
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,350
Please.

290
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,523
Please, step aside.

291
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,030
I need you to move the vehicle, sir.

292
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,157
Hey, hey, relax.

293
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,325
Easy!

294
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,160
Don't you fucking touch me!

295
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,666
Motherfucker, let's go.

296
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,174
- Hey!  - Shut the fuck up.

297
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,300
Back the fuck up!

298
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,345
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

299
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,572
What's going on, Sergeant?

300
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,909
Chief, they're pissed off.

301
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,381
They say there ain't no water. All they want is water.

302
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,975
There's nothing we can do about that.

303
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,384
We just gotta get our vehicles moving.

304
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,117
I want you to get the men back in the vehicles now.

305
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,191
Hey! Hey!

306
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,058
Get in the fucking car!

307
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,760
Get the fuck back! Get the fuck back in your vehicle!

308
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,925
Back from the truck. Get back from the truck.

309
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,304
- Don't stop.  - No, sir.

310
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,304


311
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,957
Okay, so we're convening an Iraqi Freedom convention

312
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,797
here inside the Green Zone tomorrow.

313
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,603
We are expecting to have representatives from all three main ethnic groups,

314
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,542
the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni, angling for different levels of power.

315
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,274
It is our hope that Ahmed Zubaidi

316
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,340
will emerge in a leadership position.

317
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,481
Ben, are you satisfied that we're in a good place now?

318
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,317
I think we're in a good place now,

319
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,756
except for, perhaps, the press we're getting from this looting issue.

320
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,758
Okay, well, let's table that for now.

321
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,023
In terms of stabilization...

322
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,895
Zubaidi hasn't been here for 30 years.

323
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,767
Well, he's the best bet we have right now for a stable democracy.

324
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,900
You find me 10 guys in Baghdad who even know who he is.

325
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,274
Well, he's our friend, Marty. He's been very helpful.

326
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,937
Our office is extremely satisfied

327
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,676
with all the information that we've gotten from him.

328
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,218
Zubaidi's been selling us a crock of shit for years.

329
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,278
This guy is not reliable. His intelligence is not reliable.

330
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,050
His report chain is not reliable.

331
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,525
This is exactly why people are losing confidence in the Agency, Marty.

332
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,728
You're questioning every single piece of intelligence that's coming in,

333
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,697
up to the point where we can't make any progress.

334
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,599
You cannot just hand this country over to an exile no one's ever heard of

335
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,534
and a bunch of interns from Washington.

336
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,572
Well, you're a Middle East expert, Marty.

337
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,733
If you got a better idea, why don't you just throw it out here on the table?

338
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,300
We need to use the Iraqi army to help us.

339
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,472
This country is a powder keg of ethnic division.

340
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,142
Now Saddam is gone, they're the only ones who can hold this place together.

341
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,651
We're not selling that to the American people.

342
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,414
- We beat the Iraqi army.  - Right.

343
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,977
Well, they're still out there and they're armed,

344
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,546
and they're looking for a place in the new Iraq.

345
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,057
They're going to be waiting a long time.

346
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,888
They didn't all follow Saddam.

347
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,656
There are officers we can work with out there,

348
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,787
if we make it worth their while.

349
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,262
Hey, let me tell you something.

350
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,095
We've spent too much American treasure

351
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,657
and too many American lives

352
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,067
for us to put a Ba'athist general into a position of power.

353
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:43,073
Have you any idea what's going on outside the Green Zone?

354
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,235
It's chaos. No police, revenge killings every night.

355
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,438
People are asking why we can't stop this.

356
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,242
- We are losing the population.  - Democracy is messy.

357
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,907
Democracy is messy.

358
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,112
If you dismantle this country and cut out the army,

359
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,280
you'll have civil war in six months.

360
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,550
I guarantee it.

361
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,057
Okay, let's move on.

362
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:27,057


363
00:22:28,624 --> 00:22:31,057


364
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:35,857


365
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,257


366
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,957


367
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:48,857


368
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,381
We are continuing to hold at the intersection at Alpha-Charlie-three,

369
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,473
Calm down!

370
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,710
Listen to me, please!

371
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,150
Just listen. Sergeant Wilkins!

372
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,747
- Get on the ground!  - My arm!

373
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,815
Hey, what's going on over there, Wilkins?

374
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,555
Chief, there's a local here, He's out of control,

375
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,755
Perry had to tackle him,

376
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,354
I'm on my way.

377
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,565
All right, back up.

378
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,096
You stay the fuck down.

379
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,605
- What's going on?  - You are hurting me!

380
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,799
What's going on here, Sergeant?

381
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,036
This Hajji says he needs to talk to you about something.

382
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,873
I have no idea. He goes on and on and on.

383
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:34,969
Stay down.

384
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,638
Why are you doing this? Why you do it?

385
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,841
You agree someone do this to you?

386
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,076
Hey, Perry. Perry.

387
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,209
You let him up. Let him up.

388
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,343
You agree?

389
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,752
Up? I can stand up now?

390
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,615
Why you are doing this, huh? Why you are doing this?

391
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,455
You agree someone put your head in the dust like this?

392
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,996
You agree to be treated like this? This is not fair!

393
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,428
Hey, calm down.

394
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,999
I'm trying to calm down, but this guy, he put me on the floor!

395
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,729
Are you finished?

396
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,897
Yeah, I'm finished.

397
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:02,997
What's your name?

398
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,942
My name is Farid Youssef Abdul Rahman. You call me Freddy, okay?

399
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,106
I have information. I was driving like five minutes from here.

400
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:14,551
I saw some people, you know, like Saddam's men, like Ba'athist people.

401
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,144
They are meeting. They have a meeting near to here.

402
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,019
I saw you are... I don't know, you're digging here,

403
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,058
- and I come to tell you.  - Okay, just calm down. Hey! Hey! Hey!

404
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,094
Calm down. Calm down.

405
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,129
Why should I believe you, Freddy?

406
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,791
You think it's easy to come and talk to American?

407
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,733
You think it's easy? I come here, all these people, they're looking at me?

408
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,997
You stick me on the floor. I want to speak to you quietly, huh.

409
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,163
And you are digging in the ground.

410
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,729
Why you are digging in the ground?

411
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,605
You need to talk to these people. You know what they are saying?

412
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,737
You think someone can put something in this place

413
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,680
with all these people watching and all these people don't know?

414
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,410
It's not logical.

415
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,547
I am here to help you, okay, Miller?

416
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,422
Come with me, Freddy. Come with me.

417
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,519
Chief, you good?

418
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,029
Yeah, I'm fine.

419
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,995
Sir, come this way, please.

420
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,830
Hey, Chief! Chief, what are we doing?

421
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,972
Hey, I'm gonna need his car keys. Freddy, give him your car keys.

422
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,097
My keys?

423
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,199
Chief, you don't believe this guy, do you?

424
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,301
Look, I wanna go real low-vis on this.

425
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,779
I want to take Freddy's car and I want to get maybe one other.

426
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,750
If we roll over there in those Humvees, they're going to see us coming.

427
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,515
I want to take Keating, Potts, Bronner on comms.

428
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,182
You gotta get me Michaels with the SAW and bring Perry over here.

429
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,282
What's up, Chief?

430
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,417
Hey, you guys ready to go to work?

431
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,551
Hell, yeah, Chief.

432
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,459
Chief, let me talk to you, please.

433
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,554
What?

434
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,326
Chief, our mission is here.

435
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,999
What, you wanna sit around and dig holes all day?

436
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,764
I want to get something done.

437
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,108
All right, here's the situation,

438
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,007
This Iraqi just showed up with information

439
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,705
that about two or three "K" west of here,

440
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,372
there's a meeting taking place right now,

441
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,382
possible high-value targets involved,

442
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,849
So I want to move on it,

443
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,355
In the first car, I want to take the Iraqi guy, Freddy,

444
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,356
Keating, you're going to drive, I'll ride shotgun.

445
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,688
Potts, you're in the back covering Freddy the entire time.

446
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,251
The rest of you guys are going to roll in the pick-up truck. Any questions?

447
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:08,823
Hey, Chief, how do we know this guy isn't leading us into a fucking ambush?

448
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,265
We don't.

449
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,802
Get your fucking game face on.

450
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,666
Roger.

451
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,675
- Hooah.  -  Hooah!

452
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,677
- All right, let's roll.  - You're not letting me drive, huh?

453
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,973
No, you're not driving.

454
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,514
Weapons ready.

455
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,541
It's Freddy, right? I'm Potts. Nice to meet you.

456
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,086
Fire it up!

457
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,396


458
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,896


459
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,896


460
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,896


461
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,896


462
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,796


463
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,896


464
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,096


465
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,896


466
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,296


467
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,449


468
00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:10,849


469
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:14,749


470
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:19,749


471
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:27,849


472
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:33,449


473
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,749


474
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:38,749


475
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:41,849


476
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:46,349


477
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:49,849


478
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,498
Okay, Sergeant Perry, I want you to carry on straight.

479
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,366
Take your next left, and go around the back.

480
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,099
Roger that, Chief.

481
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,102
And if you stop here, it is the house on that corner.

482
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,646
Okay, pull up here. Pull up here.

483
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,616
Okay, be advised, it is the house on the southeast corner.

484
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,209
The big white house with the wall.

485
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,313
Heads up. Someone's coming out.

486
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,188
There were six or seven men with guns.

487
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:55,564
All right, we got a guy with a briefcase and another with an AK-47.

488
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,466
Perry, where are you? You in position?

489
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,406
In position, Chief. We got them.

490
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,533
Black BMW with three men.

491
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:05,768
I want to take the BMW.

492
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,641
As soon as he comes up our way, we're going to cut him off.

493
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,170
I want to take the BMW and then the house. Go, go, go.

494
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,182
Go, go, go!

495
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,226
Out of the fucking car! Get the fuck out of the car, now!

496
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,420
Perry, get on that door.

497
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,424
Get on that door.

498
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,965
Zip him up. Bronner, stay with him.

499
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,397
Everybody else, go, go, go, go, go!

500
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,695
On me. Stack on me.

501
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,823
Let's go! Let's go! Go, go, go!

502
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,127
On the fucking ground, now!

503
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,392
All right, down, down, down.

504
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,326
Clear! This side clear!

505
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,567
I've got no exit. Where's the back door? Michaels, with me!

506
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,165
Keating, on the stairs up!

507
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,671
Stairs down. Michaels, come with me down! Down!

508
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,376
With you, Chief.

509
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,464
Taking fire!

510
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,168
Look out!

511
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,403
Get ready to hook right.

512
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,571
Hook right!

513
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,342
I got stairs up.

514
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,078
Clear. It's clear.

515
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,624
This is Chief. Give me a sit rep.

516
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,160
This is Potts, got one wrapped up,

517
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,423
Keating, all clear out front,

518
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,265
Chief, this is Perry, I need you up here right away.

519
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,167
Coming in!

520
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,077
- It's okay. Your husband is okay.  - Perry!

521
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,873
Look, Chief, you gotta do something.

522
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,278
They don't understand what the fuck I'm saying.

523
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,347
This is the mother, that's the mother. Enough! Enough.

524
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,484
Tell her to calm down. Say, "Calm down."

525
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,152
I don't understand her, Chief. It's a different dialect.

526
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,788
Don't let her leave. Don't let any of them leave this room.

527
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,456
There's a body down there. Don't let them leave.

528
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,227
You got it, Chief.

529
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,300
Ma'am, you can't go downstairs.

530
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,340
You cannot go downstairs. Stay down.

531
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,098
Shut up! Shut up!

532
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,336
Watch yourself, Potts.

533
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,245
Get Freddy in here. Stand him up. I gotta talk to him.

534
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,140
Freddy, come here.

535
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,684
- I don't want this.  - Hey, I need you to...

536
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,220
I come to you for information. I don't want this.

537
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,779
Listen, I need you to ask him questions for me.

538
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,155
Tell him you're my translator.

539
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,826
Ask him... Hey, what is this shit?

540
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,387
What is this? Is this on him?

541
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,263
Yeah, that was fucking in his back pockets.

542
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,802
He says he doesn't do anything.

543
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,701
Ask him his name.

544
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,936
His name's Seyyed Hamza.

545
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,443
Seyyed Hamza. Is this his house?

546
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,343
Is this your house?

547
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,075
Hey, listen, tell him he's gonna answer my questions

548
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,348
or things are going to go very bad for him.

549
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,885
Ask him what the meeting was about.

550
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,428
Chief, I just got off the phone.

551
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,863
That license plate belongs to General Mohammed Al Rawi.

552
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,230
The Jack of Clubs.

553
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,996
Shut the fuck up!

554
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,362
Hey, Michaels, do you have that deck of cards?

555
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,463
Yes.

556
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,007
Give me the Jack of Clubs.

557
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,776
Is that the guy? Was that the guy that went out the back?

558
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,004
Here it is, Chief.

559
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,842
Let me see. Let me see.

560
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,711
- Is that the guy?  - That's the guy. I just saw this guy.

561
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,079
- Bullshit!  - That's the fucking guy.

562
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,617
I just saw him downstairs.

563
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,711
This man. This is Saddam's top general.

564
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,984
Al Rawi? You know who this is? Al Rawi?

565
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,423
He say he don't know.

566
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,517
Al Rawi's in this house?

567
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,289
This is the guy I saw.

568
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,469
Okay, okay. Time's up. Okay, get everybody ready. We're leaving.

569
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,268
All right, he's got to know about WMD. He's coming with me.

570
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,484
Hey, Freddy, I want you to come with me.

571
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,148
- Hey, Michaels!  - What's up, Chief?

572
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,419
Bring them all over to the wall.

573
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,893
Potts, I want you to get the guy. Get the guy and bring him to me.

574
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,623
Roger that, Chief.

575
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,427
- Just sit him down against the wall.  - Yes, sir.

576
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,696
Sit those guys over there.

577
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,370
Come over here, Freddy. Come here. I need you to translate.

578
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,739
Tell him I want to know about weapons of mass destruction.

579
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,805
Does he know where the weapons are?

580
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,910
What? What? What do you know about weapons?

581
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,177
Where are the weapons?

582
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,428
He say only General Mohammed Al Rawi, he know about these things.

583
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,625
The special program is under his hand personally.

584
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,301
He's the only one who know the truth about these things.

585
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,533
Okay, how do I find Al Rawi?

586
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,776
How do I find Al Rawi?

587
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,304
He said, can you protect his family?

588
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:52,419
"If you protect my family, I will tell you how you find Mohammed."

589
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,459
"And then from him you will know the truth."

590
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,827
Okay, he's got a deal.

591
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,732
Ask him about the book.

592
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,761
What is it? Is it codes? Is it diagrams? Maps?

593
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,444
What the fuck?

594
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,132
All right, Scotty, head on down there.

595
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,107
- Shorty, bag them and parade them.  - Yes, sir.

596
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,541
- Hey, you Miller?  - Yeah.

597
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,044
Where are the other two?

598
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,409
Two what?

599
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,606
We're missing two pucks.

600
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,239
- Anybody got eyes on the other two pucks?  - No, no, no!

601
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,944
These are my guys. Hold on. Hold on. These are my prisoners.

602
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,679
My prisoner now.

603
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,484
Hey! That's my translator! That's my translator!

604
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,990
What the fuck is going on?

605
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,855
I got a colonel waiting on these guys.

606
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,088
I got orders to get these guys back there.

607
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,289
They're on route right now.

608
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,456
Hey, white bread, calm down.

609
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,193
This goes way up higher than your people, all right?

610
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,291
Please, stand right there.

611
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,892
Come on. That prisoner's ours.

612
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,766
Well, he's mine now. Let's go.

613
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,305
Take care of my family!

614
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,563
What they are doing?

615
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,234
I did nothing!

616
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,681
The book! He's got my book!

617
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,241
Chief, what the fuck's going on?

618
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,280
Fuck!

619
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,017
Yeah, I got him. He says some guy took a book off him.

620
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,423
Book? All right, all right. Notebook.

621
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,120
He says something about a book.

622
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,220
His what?

623
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,322
You got his book. He says you got his fucking book.

624
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,390
Do you have the guy's notebook? Don't fuck around.

625
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,196
I don't know what you're talking about.

626
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,261
Get your fucking hands off me, asshole.

627
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,238
Just give me the fucking book, Miller.

628
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,407
All right.

629
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,787
I fucking asked you nicely!

630
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,330
Fuck you! I don't have a fucking book!

631
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,462
Have a nice war.

632
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,407
All right, let's get out of here!

633
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,476
Get off me!

634
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,422
Hey!

635
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,891
Where's Freddy?

636
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,831
- You mean the guy with the limp?  - Yeah.

637
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,028
He went over by the alleyway.

638
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,298
Fuck! I thought you were watching him.

639
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,237
- Where's my weapon? Where's my weapon?  - Right here!

640
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,298
I gave him the book. I gave him the fucking book!

641
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,776
Potts, Michaels, go with him now! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

642
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,437
Bronner, hey! Come on!

643
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,878
Moving!

644
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,448
Go! Go!

645
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,282
Go around! Seal it! Seal it!

646
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,122
You got it, Chief!

647
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,087
Get him, Potts.

648
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,726
Go left! Go, seal it, seal it.

649
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,233
I got him! Stop!

650
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,901
Stop!

651
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,240
Get him! Get him! Get him!

652
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,318
What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck! Why are you running?

653
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,415
Why you are chasing me?

654
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,392
Give me the book.

655
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,450
Give me the fucking book!

656
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,258
Here the book. Here the book.

657
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,529
Why are you... What you are doing? I was going to bring the book back.

658
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:01,002
The man is putting Iraqis in the helicopter. He hit you in the face.

659
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,903
What you want me to do?

660
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,737
What I have to do for you to believe me?

661
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,300
Get everyone back to the trucks.

662
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,606
Roger.

663
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,204
Hey, let's go. Let's go.

664
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,978
What more I have to do for you? Huh?

665
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,848
I come to you with information. You take the information, it's right.

666
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,448
You want the book. I have the book. I give you the book.

667
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,187
You think I can leave my car?

668
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,695
You know what this car, it means to me?

669
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,732
Even you have the key!

670
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,804
What happened to your leg?

671
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,010
My leg is in Iran.

672
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,241
Since 1987.

673
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,714
Me, too, I fight for my country.

674
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,519
Freddy, listen. You give me your information.

675
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,651
I'm going to get you a reward for what you did today.

676
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,989
Reward?

677
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,028
You think I do this for money?

678
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,794
You think I don't care about my country? I see what's happening.

679
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,566
You don't think I see what's happen in it?

680
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,470
And all the people now, even they have no water,

681
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,565
they have no electricity.
643 

682
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,473
You think I do this for reward?

683
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,978
You don't think I do this for me?

684
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:19,607
For my future? For my country? For all these things?

685
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:23,141
Whatever you want here, I want more than you want.

686
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,347
I want to help my country.

687
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,729
Who is this?

688
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,069
Hey, this is Chief Miller,

689
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,637
I have something I think you'd be interested in.

690
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,339
Listen, I don't have time to play games, Just tell me what you've got,

691
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:54,009
Well, this morning I came face to face with Mohammed Al Rawi.

692
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,449
General Al Rawi?

693
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,817
Yeah, the Jack of Clubs.

694
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,014
Come in and talk to me,

695
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,888
I'm in the Green Zone, Republican Palace. By the pool.

696
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,184
I'm on my way.

697
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,196
Hey, Sergeant Wilkins, I gotta talk to you.

698
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,858
We gotta go get our prisoner back, find this guy, Al Rawi.

699
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,128
Let Bethel handle it, please.

700
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,500
No. Bethel can't see past the files on his desk.

701
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,833
So, what, you're going to ring the doorbell now

702
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,463
- and ask Special Forces to hand him over?  - No.

703
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,269
I'm going to use the book and trade up and get some help.

704
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,366
What are you talking about?

705
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,412
Jerry, why the fuck do we keep coming up empty on all these sites?

706
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,572
There has gotta be a reason.

707
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,849
Chief, we're here to do a job and get home safe.

708
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,679
That's all. The reasons don't matter.

709
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,548
They matter to me.

710
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,350
With all due respect, Chief, I can't go with you on this.

711
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,624
Understood. I'm going to split the team.

712
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,254
I'm going to take my crew plus Sergeant Perry.

713
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,061
You report back to Bethel with everyone else, hooah?

714
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,225
Hooah.

715
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,365
Hey, Freddy. You want a job?

716
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,466
Yes.

717
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,272
Good. Get in your car, follow us.

718
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,369
Where to, Chief?

719
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,936
Republican Palace.

720
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,389
This is not a good time, Lawrie.

721
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,725
I've waited long enough.

722
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,027
I told you, I'm doing the best I can.

723
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,500
This is not what I signed up for, Clark.

724
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,969
I put my reputation on the line with these stories.

725
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,972
I am not going to let you hang me out to dry.

726
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,200
Well, there's huge things at stake here.

727
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,176
I'm not going to let them be compromised because you need to sell some newspapers.

728
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,543
You knew the deal. I give you Magellan, you give me anonymity.

729
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,478
Listen, Clark, I'm done waiting, so is the paper.

730
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:39,416
You won't help me find Magellan, I'm going to find someone who can.

731
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,442
Right here.

732
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,439
- Can you get me some more beers?  - Frisbee!

733
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,847
Oh, shit!

734
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,355
Oh, my goodness. We got enough time for that?

735
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,555
These guys got Domino's Pizza and fucking beer?

736
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,797
Get in the pool, man.

737
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,493
Sergeant Perry, I've gotta go talk to this guy,

738
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,126
so you all are on your own for a little while.

739
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,534
Roger that.

740
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:01,628
Can we have beer?

741
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:02,967
Not one.

742
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,013
So, what happened?

743
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,815
We were digging at a site.

744
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,289
Local come up to us and give us a tip that there was a meeting going on

745
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,383
with some high-value targets nearby.

746
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,588
We hit the house, and it turned out the guy was right. Al Rawi was there.

747
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,632
- You sure it was him?  - Positive.

748
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,361
He had a security detail with him, and we exchanged fire with them

749
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,268
and he slipped out during the firefight.

750
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,011
Now that's the book that I took off this guy, Seyyed Hamza.

751
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,445
He was the host of the meeting.

752
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,676
And I was in the process of figuring out what the fuck it was

753
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,275
when SF showed up and snatched him.

754
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,918
God damn!

755
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,684
Okay, but where did they take him?

756
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,918
Because if you can get me access to this guy,

757
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,654
I'll get Al Rawi.

758
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,761
Look, we're both after the WMD, right?

759
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,594
It's a little more complicated than that.

760
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,400
Well, not to me, it isn't.

761
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,671
All right, I'll make a call, get you reassigned.

762
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,305
There are some empty buildings on the other side of the compound.

763
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,747
Get out of uniform and report to my office in an hour.

764
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,307
Outstanding.

765
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,863
How'd you get the bloody nose?

766
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,992
Oh, that's a long story.

767
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,763
You're in the 85th. That's WMD unit, right?

768
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:44,733
How did you know that?

769
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,571
It's right there on your rifle.

770
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:50,238
Lawrie Dayne, Wall Street Journal, How's it going?

771
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,310
You know, we haven't found shit yet. Hey, Sergeant Perry.

772
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,376
We'll find it. It's frustrating, right?

773
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,580
Little bit.

774
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,488
So what are you and Marty talking about?

775
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,856
Oh, you know I can't talk to you about that.

776
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,417
Oh, come on.

777
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,659
You come in fresh off the field to have a lemonade with Martin Brown?

778
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,064
Something's gotta be going on.

779
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,834
Well, you could ask him.

780
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,201
I'm asking you.

781
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,673
Does it make sense to you that we're still coming up empty?

782
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,371
No. No, it doesn't.

783
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,839
Someone told us they were there, right?

784
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,179
If you come across anything,

785
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,447
call me.

786
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,963
I'll keep it in mind.

787
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:10,963


788
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:20,963


789
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:27,963


790
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:32,563


791
00:47:33,995 --> 00:47:38,263


792
00:47:38,995 --> 00:47:42,263


793
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:48,263


794
00:47:48,995 --> 00:47:57,163


795
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,012
Where's he hiding? Where's Al Rawi?

796
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,654
Where's Al Rawi?

797
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,525
How long have they been going?

798
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,855
For about 10 minutes.

799
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,453
You want to see your wife and kids again? You have five kids,

800
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,122
You want them to see their father?

801
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,101
He says, "Please, do not involve my family in this situation,"

802
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,695
"I swear to God..."

803
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,366
You're involved, so your family's involved,

804
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:34,274
All I want is an answer, where to look for this man,

805
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,676
and you can walk out of here,

806
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,408
- Where's Al Rawi?  - Where's Al Rawi?

807
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,280
And I want a name or an address,

808
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:44,618
Somewhere I can find General Al Rawi,

809
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,747
I am going to get an answer,

810
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,883
and you know you're going to tell me something,

811
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,397
All right, I'm going to let go and you're going to give me an address,

812
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,231
Where's Al Rawi? Where is he?

813
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,135
The book! The book!

814
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,864
He says you need the book,

815
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,339
The fucking book again? What's in the book?

816
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,706
"The book, that's how you'll find him,"

817
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,338
It has the names and locations of Al Rawi's safe houses,

818
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,388
Chief Miller around?

819
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,194
Yeah. Up the stairs, down on the right.

820
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:44,505
Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone, Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.

821
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,606
A great job bagging Hamza.

822
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,477
Thanks. Appreciate it.

823
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,076
Walk you out?

824
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,879
Sure.

825
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,955
- You're with our MET Team, right?  - Yeah.

826
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,993
Well, the administration really appreciates the work you guys are doing.

827
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,187
We gotta get this WMD issue behind us

828
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,129
so we can get on with the challenges of the future.

829
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,894
That's where this Hamza guy could be helpful.

830
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,764
He's confirmed a few facts for us.

831
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,135
Says your guys might have lifted a notebook from him.

832
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,868
Well, everything I got off him I gave to Martin Brown.

833
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,569
Why don't you ask him if he's got it?

834
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,133
I don't think Marty would go for that.

835
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,612
He's a hell of a guy, but he's been in the Middle East a long time.

836
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,149
He's got a lot of preconceived ideas.

837
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,378
Our unit's trying to get back to the raw intel.

838
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,680
Look, I don't want to throw Marty under a bus,

839
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,552
but he doesn't like what we're coming up with.

840
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,681
The guy's a dinosaur,

841
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,250
and we need to get some new thinking going on around here.

842
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:34,229
There's an opportunity for you here, Miller.

843
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,730
I know Marty's pulled you in temporarily,

844
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,735
but if you're looking for something more permanent, I can help.

845
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,929
We're doing a good thing here. We're going to rebuild this place.

846
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,976
People are watching us.

847
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,439
I'll keep it in mind.

848
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,846
You do that.

849
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,842
If you hear anything about that notebook, let me know.

850
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,170
Your friend from the Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit came to see me.

851
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:05,233
Poundstone?

852
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:06,539
Yeah, Poundstone.

853
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:10,174
Poundstone's unit pushed all that WMD intel you've been chasing your tail on.

854
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,911
What? You mean Magellan?

855
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,680
Who is Magellan? Have you ever met him?

856
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:14,845
No.

857
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:16,684
Poundstone's got him locked up tight.

858
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:19,691
That's why we gotta find out what's going on.

859
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:21,019
Here's the deal.

860
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:22,220
We checked the notebook.

861
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:24,889
It's a list of addresses around Baghdad, mostly Adhamiya.

862
00:51:24,964 --> 00:51:27,956
It's a Sunni stronghold, very sympathetic to the army.

863
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,093
More than likely, that's where Al Rawi is.

864
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,570
The notebook's probably his line to his battalion commanders.

865
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:33,663
We all set?

866
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,537
Not yet. We're waiting on military support.

867
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:39,044
Push them hard. I want to get every address in that book.

868
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:40,670
So, what do you think that meeting was about?

869
00:51:40,747 --> 00:51:43,215
What would you be talking about if you just got invaded?

870
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:45,478
You think Al Rawi wants to fight?

871
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,816
If we don't make him an offer, he will.

872
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:49,878
What? You're going to cut a deal?

873
00:51:49,956 --> 00:51:53,119
You're going to cut a deal with the Jack of Clubs?

874
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,455
What do you think you're doing here, Miller?

875
00:51:56,529 --> 00:51:58,463
You're off reservation for a reason. What is it?

876
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:01,500
Well, I came to find weapons and save lives.

877
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:03,365
And I didn't find shit.

878
00:52:03,436 --> 00:52:05,063
I want to know why.

879
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:08,107
There are no easy answers. If you want that, go work with Poundstone.

880
00:52:08,174 --> 00:52:10,165
All we got is hard choices.

881
00:52:10,243 --> 00:52:11,835
You want to know what happened to the weapons?

882
00:52:12,245 --> 00:52:14,179
We gotta find Al Rawi and bring him in.

883
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:15,908
He'll give us the truth about WMD

884
00:52:15,982 --> 00:52:20,112
and give us a shot at standing this country up without a bloodbath.

885
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:22,981
Do you want the job or not?

886
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:27,983
- Yeah, I want it.  - Good.

887
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:32,193
Hamza's being held at the high-value target wing at Camp Cropper.

888
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:34,199
Poundstone's unit have him under wraps.

889
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:36,701
So, how are you going to get to him?

890
00:52:36,769 --> 00:52:38,464
I'm not. You are.

891
00:52:39,205 --> 00:52:40,536
Here's a pass.

892
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:44,407
We've got another prisoner there we can use to get you in.

893
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:47,537
Low-level Republican Guard, way below their radar.

894
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:50,481
Use him as an excuse to get to Hamza.

895
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,415
Here's a million dollars in cash.

896
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:55,113
Tell Hamza the money's his if he gives us what we need.

897
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:58,121
You tell him if he gives Al Rawi to me,

898
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:00,785
keeps his mouth shut over there until I bring him in,

899
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,626
I'll have him and his family out of the country by the end of the week.

900
00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:07,689
You want me to tell him to not talk to the American interrogators?

901
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,291
That's right.

902
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:14,533
I thought we were all on the same side.

903
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,199
Don't be naive.

904
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:41,961
Miller.

905
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:44,432
Pentagon just revoked your transfer.

906
00:53:44,504 --> 00:53:48,463
You're being released back to your unit, effective immediately.

907
00:53:49,742 --> 00:53:51,801
You chose the wrong side.

908
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,449
Follow me, Freddy. We gotta move fast.

909
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:03,981
Where do you think you're going?

910
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:07,117
Let us through. Step aside, please.

911
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:13,226
What the hell are you playing at? Get me Langley.

912
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:15,233
You are required to hand over all information.

913
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:18,327
White House authorization. I want the book.

914
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:31,610
DC's got too much riding on this to have you and some Ba'athist generals fuck it up.

915
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:33,881
Martin.

916
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:35,916
Langley confirms.

917
00:54:37,824 --> 00:54:39,223
I've got it!

918
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:46,231
Let's go. Stay out of this, Marty.

919
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:49,928
- You all right here?  - Yeah.

920
00:55:00,446 --> 00:55:02,175
Use local assets.

921
00:55:03,116 --> 00:55:04,913
It's high priority.

922
00:55:36,144 --> 00:55:40,006


923
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:46,579


924
00:55:50,763 --> 00:55:52,754
Stay close to me, Freddy.

925
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,526
Put him down.

926
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:01,533
OGA.

927
00:56:01,607 --> 00:56:03,768
I'm here to see a prisoner.

928
00:56:09,615 --> 00:56:11,207
- Heads up, Sarge.  - Hey, Sergeant.

929
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,478
Hello, sir.

930
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,153
I'm here to see Abdullah Ferat.

931
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:19,651
I'm gonna have to search your bag.

932
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:21,023
What's up with Hajji?

933
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:22,857
He's my translator.

934
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,066
Arms up, legs apart.

935
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:41,640
Check it out.

936
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:43,511
What's that in your pocket?

937
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,346
It's my cigarettes.

938
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:48,683
- Good to go.  - Here you go, sir.

939
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:51,349
Go ahead and take them back to IR-1.

940
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:08,540
Right here.

941
00:57:30,263 --> 00:57:31,890
That's not necessary, Sergeant.

942
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:33,898
Standard procedure, sir.

943
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:43,298
Sergeant, I have to have a classified conversation with the prisoner.

944
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,570
You can go on and step outside.

945
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:47,044
Roger, sir. Be right outside.

946
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:13,299
Do you know why they brought him here?

947
00:58:15,975 --> 00:58:19,411
He's here because he's in the Republican Guard, Freddy.

948
00:58:19,712 --> 00:58:21,304
Hey, Sergeant.

949
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:24,682
Hey, listen, this guy just gave us a piece of intel.

950
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,345
You apparently have a prisoner in your HVT wing here named Seyyed Hamza.

951
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,513
He can ID him for me.

952
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,682
I gotta get him down here and ID him real quick.

953
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:34,351
You're going to need an EJ-75 for that, man.

954
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,485
Guys, I got a live op going.

955
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:37,995
I got a team in place ready to move on a target. I gotta do this now.

956
00:58:38,064 --> 00:58:39,053
How long will it take?

957
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:40,155
Two minutes.

958
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:42,292
- Just two minutes?  - That's it. Two minutes. Come on.

959
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:44,336
- All right.  - Good, let's go. Hey, Freddy.

960
00:58:48,074 --> 00:58:50,304
Put those bags on their heads.

961
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,054
OGA coming in for an ID check.

962
00:59:18,971 --> 00:59:20,336
Hey, Hamza.

963
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,768
Get up.

964
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:26,272
Shit.

965
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:30,148
Get a medic!

966
00:59:33,185 --> 00:59:34,880
I said, get a medic!

967
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:39,188
Hey, get the medics on the phone. We've got a situation here.

968
00:59:40,593 --> 00:59:43,323
He say, "Why did you do this to me?"

969
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:49,967
He say the general did everything you ask of him in the meeting.

970
00:59:50,736 --> 00:59:52,931
What do you... What meeting?

971
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,564
What meeting?

972
01:00:02,281 --> 01:00:04,112
He just say Jordan.

973
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:05,606
Clear the way! Clear the way!

974
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,709
What is going on here, Miller?

975
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:08,777
Coming through! Okay.

976
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:12,286
What does he mean, "Jordan"?

977
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:20,895
We gotta stop the bleeding. His pulse is weak.

978
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:03,536


979
01:01:12,774 --> 01:01:15,190


980
01:01:28,356 --> 01:01:29,918


981
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:32,134


982
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:38,161
I need to talk to you about Magellan.

983
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:42,371
I'm going to call you right back.

984
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:44,876
What you got?

985
01:02:47,113 --> 01:02:48,637
I read your articles.

986
01:02:48,714 --> 01:02:51,683
You said an Iraqi WMD source named Magellan

987
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:54,345
met with US officials prior to the war.

988
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,149
I need to know about that meeting.

989
01:02:56,222 --> 01:02:59,487
Oh, no. Come on, Miller. I can't discuss my sources with you.

990
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:03,460
Well, did you ever meet the guy? Do you know who he is?

991
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:07,124
Of course I didn't meet him. He's an Iraqi internal, for Christ's sake.

992
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,259
Then how do you know what he's saying is true?

993
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:15,301
Because I made contact through a reliable intermediary.

994
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,932
- Reliable?  - Yes.

995
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:22,143
Have you ever even been to any of Magellan's sites?

996
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,183
You ever been to Diwaniya? Tikrit?

997
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,880
No.

998
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:30,080
There's nothing there.

999
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,624
Magellan's intel is bullshit.

1000
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,689
Who's the intermediary?

1001
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:40,664
No. I'm not discussing sources, Miller.

1002
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,793
Jesus Christ! This is the reason we went to war!

1003
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,139
All right, then at least tell me how it happened.

1004
01:03:53,212 --> 01:03:54,270
How does this happen?

1005
01:03:54,346 --> 01:03:57,645
How does somebody like you write something that's not true?

1006
01:03:57,716 --> 01:03:59,013
Tell me!

1007
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,815
What do you know?

1008
01:04:09,328 --> 01:04:14,960
Look, I got a phone call one day from a senior official in DC.

1009
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:18,063
He says, "I've got a story for you."

1010
01:04:18,137 --> 01:04:20,833
"The truth about Saddam's WMD programs."

1011
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,937
So I go to meet him.

1012
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,506
He puts the source report in my hands.

1013
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:29,647
Magellan's product, the raw intel.

1014
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:32,981
But when do you check the story?

1015
01:04:35,921 --> 01:04:38,151
He was a senior official, for Christ's sake.

1016
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:40,818
He had access to Magellan's debrief.

1017
01:04:40,893 --> 01:04:45,023
All he asked was that I not disclose the location of the meeting.

1018
01:04:46,332 --> 01:04:47,356
The location.

1019
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:49,799
Yes, in case I'd compromise the source.

1020
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:53,630
It was Jordan, wasn't it?

1021
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:57,100
The meeting was in Jordan.

1022
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,808
Yes.

1023
01:05:16,328 --> 01:05:18,796
You can keep your million dollars.

1024
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:21,062
Al Rawi's Magellan.

1025
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:25,896
They're debriefing Magellan. They've got him held tight.

1026
01:05:26,305 --> 01:05:28,205
Supposing they don't?

1027
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,708
John, take care of the money.

1028
01:05:34,246 --> 01:05:37,340
Hamza said Al Rawi met US officials in Jordan.

1029
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:39,145
Now Dayne said the same thing about Magellan.

1030
01:05:39,451 --> 01:05:41,214
That's more than a coincidence.

1031
01:05:41,287 --> 01:05:43,949
Maybe. It doesn't make any sense.

1032
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,751
If Poundstone met Al Rawi in Jordan, what's he hiding?

1033
01:05:46,825 --> 01:05:50,420
Well, what if he told him something he didn't wanna hear?

1034
01:05:50,496 --> 01:05:53,158
What if he told him there were no WMD?

1035
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,728
I want Al Rawi's movements outside Iraq.

1036
01:05:59,805 --> 01:06:02,069
January, February, 2003. Anything you got.

1037
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:03,574
I'm on it.

1038
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:07,111
It all makes sense. The bad intel.

1039
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:09,545
Why our teams came up empty at those sites.

1040
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:12,846
Maybe we're looking at this thing the wrong way around.

1041
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,476
It's a theory.

1042
01:06:15,854 --> 01:06:16,980
You've got no proof.

1043
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,455
Don't be naive.

1044
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:25,623
Sir, Mohammed Al Rawi was in Amman, Jordan on February 5th, 2003.

1045
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:30,658
That's three days before Magellan came online.

1046
01:06:33,038 --> 01:06:35,063
Give me Clark Poundstone's movements, same period.

1047
01:06:39,812 --> 01:06:42,474
Sir, we've got a DOD Gulfstream on the same date.

1048
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:46,314
Passenger Clark Poundstone routed Washington, DC to Amman, Jordan.

1049
01:06:46,385 --> 01:06:50,412
Martin, we're getting reports of an attack on an Al Rawi safe house.

1050
01:06:50,489 --> 01:06:52,047
South Adhamiya.

1051
01:06:52,391 --> 01:06:55,622
Poundstone's hunting Al Rawi. He doesn't want the truth to get out.

1052
01:06:55,694 --> 01:06:58,094
I need to know where the next safe house is.

1053
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:45,870


1054
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:57,070


1055
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,870


1056
01:08:00,673 --> 01:08:02,095


1057
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:05,899


1058
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:17,670
All clear, Chief.

1059
01:08:19,645 --> 01:08:20,634
Send Freddy!

1060
01:08:20,712 --> 01:08:23,704
Yes, sir! Freddy, on the move.

1061
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,920
Freddy, I need you to translate.

1062
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:33,457
Tell him I need to get a message to General Al Rawi.

1063
01:08:35,761 --> 01:08:37,786
Tell him I need to meet Al Rawi tonight.

1064
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:46,129
Chief Miller on the phone for you, sir.

1065
01:08:47,139 --> 01:08:48,902
- Yeah?  - I got him,

1066
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:52,637
Tahir al-Malik, one of Al Rawi's battalion commanders.

1067
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,679
- Where is he?  - I let him go.

1068
01:08:54,746 --> 01:08:57,237
Look, I told him to get a message to Al Rawi.

1069
01:08:57,316 --> 01:09:01,047
I told him I'd meet him at the Adhamiya bus station tonight.

1070
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,611
If I can bring him in alive, then we'll have our proof.

1071
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:06,817
If he talks, then we'll get the truth about WMD,

1072
01:09:07,526 --> 01:09:10,791
All right, if you get in front of Al Rawi, offer him whatever you have to.

1073
01:09:10,863 --> 01:09:11,887
If you pull this off,

1074
01:09:11,964 --> 01:09:14,023
there's still a chance we can hold this place together,

1075
01:09:14,099 --> 01:09:15,896
I'm headed there now.

1076
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:19,763
You are serious to do a deal with Mohammed Al Rawi?

1077
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:22,739
You know what already he do to this country?

1078
01:09:24,576 --> 01:09:27,101
We're just trying to save lives, Freddy.

1079
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:30,580
There are people who think he can stop an insurgency.

1080
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,247
All right, listen up, we're going to Adhamiya.

1081
01:09:33,318 --> 01:09:36,014
But look, we're going alone, so weapons check, comms check.

1082
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:38,079
Make sure you're 100%. We got no support.

1083
01:09:38,157 --> 01:09:39,647
- Hooah?  - Hooah!

1084
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:41,158
You okay? Sergeant P, can I get a radio check?

1085
01:09:41,226 --> 01:09:42,887
- Go to one.  - Miller, what you are doing?

1086
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:44,360
- Channel one.  - Roger that.

1087
01:09:44,429 --> 01:09:46,420
Look at what's happening.

1088
01:09:52,037 --> 01:09:54,767
I just need you to do your job tonight, Freddy.

1089
01:10:00,312 --> 01:10:01,677
Let's roll!

1090
01:10:31,787 --> 01:10:33,908


1091
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,735


1092
01:10:40,644 --> 01:10:41,797


1093
01:10:43,397 --> 01:10:46,600


1094
01:10:46,603 --> 01:10:50,571


1095
01:10:51,177 --> 01:10:54,483


1096
01:10:54,893 --> 01:10:57,396


1097
01:11:22,394 --> 01:11:26,524
Thank you all very much, Admiral Kelly, Captain Card,

1098
01:11:26,598 --> 01:11:30,364
officers and sailors of the USS Abraham Lincoln,

1099
01:11:31,136 --> 01:11:32,899
my fellow Americans,

1100
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:36,540
Major combat operations in Iraq have ended,

1101
01:11:37,142 --> 01:11:38,973
In the battle of Iraq,

1102
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:42,639
the United States and our allies have prevailed.

1103
01:11:43,181 --> 01:11:44,648
All right!

1104
01:11:56,762 --> 01:11:58,286
- Yeah?  - This is Briggs,

1105
01:11:58,664 --> 01:12:00,222
we got a problem.

1106
01:12:00,465 --> 01:12:02,228
My local assets are down.

1107
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:06,067
I got a report saying it was US Army took them out and nobody called it in.

1108
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:07,604
Where's Miller?

1109
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,232
Stand by.

1110
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:13,341
All right, listen up. I need everybody on a Blue Force Tracker.

1111
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,346
Met-Delta 85th, XTF.

1112
01:12:25,657 --> 01:12:26,749
Sir.

1113
01:12:36,068 --> 01:12:37,933
He's moving northwest towards Adhamiya.

1114
01:12:38,003 --> 01:12:39,231
- ETA?  - Twelve minutes, sir.

1115
01:12:39,304 --> 01:12:40,771
ETA, 12 minutes.

1116
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:44,702
He's meeting with Al Rawi.

1117
01:12:44,776 --> 01:12:47,404
Son of a bitch. He's on his way there right now.

1118
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:48,707
All right, what do you want me to do?

1119
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:51,010
Follow Miller. He'll lead you right to him.

1120
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:54,109
And when you find Al Rawi, you take that son of a bitch out.

1121
01:12:54,186 --> 01:12:55,551
What about Miller?

1122
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,487
He's off reservation, Miller can't bring in Al Rawi,

1123
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:00,423
Don't let him get in the way.

1124
01:13:00,492 --> 01:13:02,323
I want to make that announcement.

1125
01:13:02,394 --> 01:13:03,725
- Now?  - Just make it happen!

1126
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:35,154
This is Vanguard 6 on the airborne command.

1127
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,091
I need a C-2 bird with eyes over Adhamiya.

1128
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,631
I want an ISO on all military radio

1129
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:44,226
and cell phone transmissions for a three-mile radius.

1130
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:50,036
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6, Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6,

1131
01:13:50,308 --> 01:13:52,139
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha 1.

1132
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:56,374
Alpha 1, I need you to divert to Adhamiya Central immediately,

1133
01:13:56,448 --> 01:14:00,908
We have a high-value target identified, Mohammed Al Rawi.

1134
01:14:00,986 --> 01:14:03,546
This is a kill, no capture mission.

1135
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:05,554
Roger that.

1136
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:12,621
Here they are.

1137
01:14:13,865 --> 01:14:16,493
Yeah, I'll tell him. We're on our way.

1138
01:14:18,937 --> 01:14:21,371
Poundstone's just called a press briefing downstairs.

1139
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,465
It's something big, Marty.

1140
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:59,204
This is the bus station. It's just over there.

1141
01:15:10,655 --> 01:15:12,145
Stagger two teams.

1142
01:15:12,224 --> 01:15:13,691
I'm going to move across to the kiosk.

1143
01:15:13,758 --> 01:15:17,125
You give me 30 seconds to get across, then follow.

1144
01:16:15,587 --> 01:16:18,556
Someone just showed up. I'm going to follow.

1145
01:16:26,998 --> 01:16:29,865
Two minutes, people, Two minutes to the announcement,

1146
01:17:04,102 --> 01:17:06,900
He's going out the central alley, west.

1147
01:17:15,914 --> 01:17:18,906
Thank you all for coming at such short notice,

1148
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:22,912
We have a major announcement,

1149
01:17:22,988 --> 01:17:24,853
This follows in lockstep with our commitment

1150
01:17:24,923 --> 01:17:27,357
to eliminate the tyranny of Saddam Hussein

1151
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:31,759
and expeditiously transform Iraq into a modern, functioning democracy,

1152
01:17:32,964 --> 01:17:34,898
Ambassador Bremer has just signed an order

1153
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,367
immediately disbanding Iraq's remaining military forces,

1154
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:42,933
The Coalition Provisional Authority hereby dissolves

1155
01:17:43,008 --> 01:17:46,671
the entirety of Iraq's military and paramilitary forces,

1156
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,044
ministries of defense,

1157
01:17:49,114 --> 01:17:53,676
information, military affairs, intelligence and national security,

1158
01:17:54,386 --> 01:17:56,877
all officers, soldiers, conscripts

1159
01:17:56,955 --> 01:18:00,152
and other military figures are relieved of duty,

1160
01:18:01,026 --> 01:18:04,894
all military ranks, titles and status are canceled,

1161
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:10,597
in addition, Iraq's ruling Ba'ath Party is dissolved with immediate effect,

1162
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:15,834
Party members will be summarily fired from central and local government offices,

1163
01:18:15,907 --> 01:18:20,276
hospitals, universities, schools and other public institutions,

1164
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:25,341
this is the dawn of new leadership in Iraq, and let the world take note,

1165
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:28,352
change is coming to the Middle East at last,

1166
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:47,595
Still moving southwest. Southwest.

1167
01:18:47,672 --> 01:18:49,071
Copy that,

1168
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:15,457
You got him?

1169
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:17,330
Yeah, I see him.

1170
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,366
I lost contact.

1171
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:24,999
I lost contact.

1172
01:19:39,324 --> 01:19:41,019
Fuck! Get an angle!

1173
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:42,650
Fuck, he's in the vehicle.

1174
01:19:42,727 --> 01:19:44,092
- God damn it!  - Stay on Chief!

1175
01:19:44,162 --> 01:19:45,151
Where the fuck did they go?

1176
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:46,254
Did he get in the vehicle?

1177
01:19:46,331 --> 01:19:48,697
Let's go! Let's go! This is MET Team "D."

1178
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:51,361
We need help, American soldier kidnapped!

1179
01:19:51,436 --> 01:19:52,767
We need help down here!

1180
01:19:53,805 --> 01:19:56,501
All units, we need help in the Adhamiya district,

1181
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:59,566
Copy that, MET Team. This is Vanguard 6 and TF221.

1182
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:01,578
What's your position and status?

1183
01:20:01,646 --> 01:20:05,104
Vanguard 6, we're five blocks south of the Adhamiya bus station.

1184
01:20:05,183 --> 01:20:07,208
Kidnappers heading east in two small cars,

1185
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:09,344
Roger that. MetD, I am en route.

1186
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,253
I need you to return to your vehicles and await further instructions.

1187
01:20:18,029 --> 01:20:20,224
Falcon 16, this is Vanguard 6.

1188
01:20:20,298 --> 01:20:24,394
We have a US soldier abducted. We need eyes on those vehicles now!

1189
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:26,935
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.

1190
01:20:27,005 --> 01:20:29,906
Currently two klicks northeast of Adhamiya.

1191
01:20:29,974 --> 01:20:33,273
Establishing an area of perimeter and sweeping Adhamiya.

1192
01:20:33,344 --> 01:20:35,835
AOR 87, Alpha Tango.

1193
01:20:36,881 --> 01:20:39,179
We gotta get him out of there.

1194
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,509
Get me Chief Miller now.

1195
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:07,203
They've taken him. God damn it! They've taken him.

1196
01:21:21,326 --> 01:21:23,453
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.

1197
01:21:23,528 --> 01:21:26,156
I've got your two vehicles moving rapidly.

1198
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,238
The two vehicles just entered a garage.

1199
01:21:38,309 --> 01:21:40,504
There's a large water tower on top of the building.

1200
01:21:40,578 --> 01:21:45,379
Grid Kilo-Zulu-8732-6428.

1201
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:49,546
- Alpha 1, I'm going in on foot. Continue to target.  - Acknowledge.

1202
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:55,251
This is Alpha 1. We're three klicks from target area.

1203
01:21:55,326 --> 01:21:58,762
All right, put us down. Find an LZ a klick from here.

1204
01:23:01,029 --> 01:23:02,429


1205
01:23:32,957 --> 01:23:34,424
Who are you?

1206
01:23:34,892 --> 01:23:37,224
General, my name's Roy Miller.

1207
01:23:37,295 --> 01:23:39,786
I'm a chief warrant officer with the US Army.

1208
01:23:40,865 --> 01:23:42,594
What do you want?

1209
01:23:45,336 --> 01:23:47,304
I came here to bring you in.

1210
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:03,019
General, I'm aware that you had contact with a US official

1211
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:05,521
in the weeks leading up to the war.

1212
01:24:06,891 --> 01:24:10,349
I know you were ready to tell them everything about Iraq's WMD programs.

1213
01:24:10,428 --> 01:24:11,986
What programs?

1214
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,156
There are no programs.

1215
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:18,198
I told your official.

1216
01:24:18,703 --> 01:24:21,638
We dismantled everything after 91s.

1217
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:27,706
He told my government that you confirmed that the programs were still active.

1218
01:24:30,515 --> 01:24:33,848
He lied about what you said. That's why we're here.

1219
01:24:44,095 --> 01:24:47,155
Did anyone verify his story?

1220
01:24:48,433 --> 01:24:49,491
No.

1221
01:24:52,236 --> 01:24:55,637
Your government wanted to hear the lie, Mr. Miller.

1222
01:24:57,308 --> 01:25:02,871
They wanted Saddam out, and they did exactly what they had to do.

1223
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:05,873
This is why you are here.

1224
01:25:16,627 --> 01:25:17,685
Go.

1225
01:25:28,506 --> 01:25:31,304
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6, Give me your location,

1226
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:32,967
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha 1.

1227
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:34,944
- We're half a klick away.  - Split up,

1228
01:25:35,012 --> 01:25:36,343
Alpha team, take the west side,

1229
01:25:36,414 --> 01:25:37,972
Bravo team, take the east side of the objective.

1230
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:41,985
I got north-south. Move to assault positions. Wait for my go.

1231
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,486
Roger that,

1232
01:25:50,194 --> 01:25:53,425
So, do you have a message for me?

1233
01:25:57,702 --> 01:26:00,170
General, if you come in with me,

1234
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:04,872
there are still people in Washington who will work with you.

1235
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:09,672
People who understand that we still need the Iraqi army

1236
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:11,237
to hold this place together.

1237
01:26:11,315 --> 01:26:14,443
Then why is your government disbanding the Army?

1238
01:26:15,153 --> 01:26:16,950
Making us outlaws.

1239
01:26:18,055 --> 01:26:21,582
Why take Iraq apart piece by piece?

1240
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,220
Why?

1241
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:31,099
I risked my life

1242
01:26:32,336 --> 01:26:34,861
to tell you the truth about WMD.

1243
01:26:36,007 --> 01:26:40,307
"Tell the truth and you'll have a place in the new Iraq," they said.

1244
01:26:41,579 --> 01:26:44,571
So where is my place, Mr. Miller?

1245
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,649
On a deck of cards?

1246
01:27:35,766 --> 01:27:38,234
Why are you really here, Miller?

1247
01:27:07,325 --> 01:27:08,325


1248
01:27:15,169 --> 01:27:16,169


1249
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:41,871
You were supposed to lead me into a trap.

1250
01:27:43,574 --> 01:27:47,704
You will tell me now how they are planning to take me.

1251
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,507
Everybody in position?

1252
01:27:51,582 --> 01:27:53,777
Vanguard Bravo in position.

1253
01:27:55,519 --> 01:27:58,545
Vanguard 6, this is Bravo 1, We're ready,

1254
01:28:03,127 --> 01:28:06,528
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha 1. We're in position.

1255
01:28:12,236 --> 01:28:14,670
You have to come in with me, General.

1256
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:17,765
You will get nothing if you fight us.

1257
01:28:20,578 --> 01:28:23,547
You have to come in now before it's too late.

1258
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:26,674
You think the war is over

1259
01:28:27,985 --> 01:28:30,579
just because you are in Baghdad?

1260
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:33,481
You will see.

1261
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,049
It has only just begun.

1262
01:28:36,594 --> 01:28:37,891
Let's go.

1263
01:28:54,145 --> 01:28:55,407
Grenade!

1264
01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:56,810
Go! Go!

1265
01:29:01,827 --> 01:29:02,827


1266
01:29:05,322 --> 01:29:06,322


1267
01:29:55,573 --> 01:29:57,541
Come on! Move!

1268
01:30:09,286 --> 01:30:12,016
Let's go. Let's go.

1269
01:30:13,057 --> 01:30:15,582
Man down! Hit the rooftop!

1270
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:16,853
Go!

1271
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,358


1272
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:24,419


1273
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,219


1274
01:30:41,318 --> 01:30:43,650
Clear! Stack on Dutch!

1275
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,184
Go!

1276
01:30:57,401 --> 01:31:00,461
"B" Team, go left. Last guy with me. Let's go!

1277
01:31:12,648 --> 01:31:14,242
I've got something.

1278
01:31:14,752 --> 01:31:17,585
Sir, I've got two hostiles headed east.

1279
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:26,027
Sir, I got one more. There's one friendly in pursuit.

1280
01:31:30,701 --> 01:31:31,725
Hold!

1281
01:31:31,802 --> 01:31:34,430
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16,

1282
01:31:34,505 --> 01:31:37,030
Two hostiles and one friendly have exited target site

1283
01:31:37,107 --> 01:31:41,168
and are now moving through alley northeast of your location.

1284
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:43,042
Keep the area clear,

1285
01:31:43,113 --> 01:31:45,343
I'm activating my transponder,

1286
01:31:46,684 --> 01:31:49,209
Bring me in. I want to cut them off.

1287
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:15,435
Down, get down! Get the fuck down!

1288
01:32:38,736 --> 01:32:40,829
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.

1289
01:32:40,905 --> 01:32:44,534
The targets have lost the friendly. Targets are now moving north.

1290
01:32:44,608 --> 01:32:48,374
Turn 45 degrees to your left, maintain intercepting course.

1291
01:32:48,445 --> 01:32:49,844
Turn! Turn!

1292
01:33:23,113 --> 01:33:25,172
I've lost visual contact.

1293
01:33:27,462 --> 01:33:29,862


1294
01:33:34,124 --> 01:33:36,124


1295
01:33:36,464 --> 01:33:38,464


1296
01:33:47,336 --> 01:33:49,736


1297
01:33:55,245 --> 01:33:56,735
I've got them!

1298
01:34:09,026 --> 01:34:11,358
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.

1299
01:34:11,428 --> 01:34:13,123
Keep going your current direction.

1300
01:34:13,197 --> 01:34:16,530
The target is crossing open ground, headed north.

1301
01:34:19,637 --> 01:34:21,400
RPG! Shit! 

1302
01:35:04,215 --> 01:35:06,180


1303
01:37:06,837 --> 01:37:08,304
Walk over.

1304
01:37:17,314 --> 01:37:18,679
Stop there.

1305
01:37:24,154 --> 01:37:27,521
You sure this is what they want back in Washington?

1306
01:37:40,904 --> 01:37:42,769
Put that weapon down!

1307
01:37:44,508 --> 01:37:46,169
Now, Freddy!

1308
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:55,443
What the fuck did you do?

1309
01:38:00,591 --> 01:38:03,958
It is not for you to decide what happens here.

1310
01:38:27,784 --> 01:38:30,344
Get out of here, Freddy. Go home.

1311
01:38:31,622 --> 01:38:33,055
We're gonna be locking this area down.

1312
01:38:33,123 --> 01:38:34,249
There are gonna be soldiers everywhere.

1313
01:38:34,324 --> 01:38:35,723
Go home now,

1314
01:38:36,026 --> 01:38:37,516
while you can.

1315
01:39:31,181 --> 01:39:34,981


1316
01:39:35,181 --> 01:39:38,181


1317
01:39:38,981 --> 01:39:42,181


1318
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:14,880
Do you think you can form a successful government without Sunni involvement?

1319
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:17,518
This is a new beginning for Iraq.

1320
01:40:17,594 --> 01:40:21,428
This is the end of tyranny and the beginning of freedom.

1321
01:40:22,265 --> 01:40:24,927
How long will US forces be in Iraq?

1322
01:40:25,002 --> 01:40:27,266
As long as they are needed.

1323
01:40:27,771 --> 01:40:29,636
Thank you. That's it.

1324
01:40:31,575 --> 01:40:33,406
- Clark.  - Mr. Zubaidi.

1325
01:40:33,643 --> 01:40:34,667
It's a great day.

1326
01:40:34,745 --> 01:40:36,508
Indeed, indeed. Good to see you.

1327
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:38,377
- Welcome.  - Welcome.

1328
01:40:55,399 --> 01:40:58,800
- How are you, gentlemen? How are you?  - Good, good.

1329
01:40:58,869 --> 01:41:01,770
So, does this mean there's going to be an election soon?

1330
01:41:11,348 --> 01:41:13,748
There's been a democracy deficit.

1331
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,783
Can you comment about the action last night in Adhamiya?

1332
01:41:23,393 --> 01:41:24,451
Chief Miller.

1333
01:41:24,528 --> 01:41:28,988
It's a copy of my intel report. I wanted to give it to you personally.

1334
01:41:29,266 --> 01:41:30,392
Thank you. Is this Al Rawi?

1335
01:41:30,467 --> 01:41:31,695
Yeah.

1336
01:41:31,768 --> 01:41:33,793
Yeah, I heard about this.

1337
01:41:43,013 --> 01:41:45,914
There's some pretty strong language here.

1338
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:48,674
But what's the point, Miller?

1339
01:41:48,752 --> 01:41:51,084
Do you think anybody's going to listen to you?

1340
01:41:51,154 --> 01:41:53,019
I know what you did.

1341
01:41:54,991 --> 01:41:56,390
What did you say?

1342
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,519
You made him up to get what you needed.

1343
01:41:58,595 --> 01:42:00,756
Magellan. You made him up.

1344
01:42:01,765 --> 01:42:04,859
I don't know what you're talking about, Miller.

1345
01:42:05,902 --> 01:42:08,132
When you peddled that shit in DC, did they know it was a lie?

1346
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:09,536
Or did they just never bother to ask?

1347
01:42:09,606 --> 01:42:10,834
Okay, okay.

1348
01:42:10,907 --> 01:42:13,899
Come on, none of this matters anymore. WMD? This doesn't matter.

1349
01:42:13,977 --> 01:42:16,275
What the fuck are you talking about? Of course, it fucking matters.

1350
01:42:16,346 --> 01:42:18,473
The reasons we go to war always matter!

1351
01:42:18,548 --> 01:42:21,517
It's all that fucking matters. It fucking matters.

1352
01:42:21,585 --> 01:42:23,280
At ease, soldier.

1353
01:42:25,856 --> 01:42:28,222
Do you have any idea what you've done here?

1354
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:30,885
What's going to happen next time we need people to trust us?

1355
01:42:30,961 --> 01:42:32,019
Clark!

1356
01:42:32,095 --> 01:42:33,756
We're not turning back, Miller.

1357
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:35,054
We won.

1358
01:42:35,132 --> 01:42:36,190
Clark!

1359
01:42:36,266 --> 01:42:38,928
- Son of a bitch.  -What?

1360
01:42:54,254 --> 01:42:56,194


1361
01:42:56,199 --> 01:42:58,099


1362
01:42:58,796 --> 01:43:00,496


1363
01:43:00,702 --> 01:43:03,102


1364
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:07,670


1365
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:44,270


1366
01:43:51,897 --> 01:43:53,897


1367
01:44:03,897 --> 01:44:03,897


1368
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:14,130
