1
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,699
...more airwayes silent and most
explosions in the Iraqi capital.

2
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:38,994
further explosions
are unfolding in Tikrit,

3
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:41,747
which is Saddam Hussein's
ancestral hometown.

4
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:46,126
...as well as blows from similar
explosions are unfolding...

5
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:50,588
Just a few seconds ago, another
huge blast shook this city.

6
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:54,717
Cruise missiles and
airstrikes raining down here

7
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:57,636
in a relentless assault
on Baghdad.

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,181
There is no doubt tonight
that war has begun...

9
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:04,726
...and the Iraqi capital
is experiencing shock and awe.

10
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:51,824
Approaching
target site three-five-niner.

11
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:58,038
All right, everybody,
listen up.

12
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,041
lt is a military
storage site. Diwaniya.

13
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,045
lntel estimates possible
nerve agents, choking agents,

14
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,630
live pathogens,
chemical-tipped missiles.

15
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:10,299
101st has been here all
morning, so the site is secure.

16
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:12,927
Everybody stay focused.
This is it.

17
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:24,854
Shots fired, right side,
100 meters, tops.

18
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,857
We got shots fired.
Right side, 100 meters.

19
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,204
Let's go.
Move. Move!

20
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:44,706
Okay. Go ahead.

21
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:47,625
Who's the officer
in charge?

22
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,751
Move! Move! Move!

23
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,336
Hey! Who's in charge?

24
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,838
Right here.
Lieutenant Asira.

25
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:52,964
Chief Miller,
Met-Delta.

26
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:54,882
What the fuck are all
these looters doing here?

27
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:58,135
This is a WMD site.
This is a high-priority site.

28
00:03:58,177 --> 00:04:00,887
Look, l don't even have enough
men to set up the perimeter.

29
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:02,764
We got a sniper
in this tower right here.

30
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:04,057
ln the big tower
on the back?

31
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,141
ln the big tower
on the back.

32
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:08,144
l do not have enough men to go in and
secure the inside of that compound.

33
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:11,856
Listen, listen. Intel says we got
live chemical agents in this site.

34
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:14,108
Okay, we gotta move
now! These looters...

35
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,569
l don't know what these people
are carrying out right now.

36
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,570
l gotta get into this
site. l'm going in.

37
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:20,072
Chief, you can't go in.

38
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:22,699
lf you take your team in
right now, it's on you.

39
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:25,869
Gather around. Gather around. Come
on. Listen, here's the situation.

40
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:28,496
101st sent 35 men and
one butter bar down here.

41
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,331
They don't even have
this place secure, so

42
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:31,798
here's where
we are right now.

43
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,627
Now, the weapons are in the
northwest end of the complex.

44
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:36,962
There's a sniper holed
up in the big tower there.

45
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:38,839
We're going to have
to quickly take him out.

46
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:42,092
l'm going to take a recon element
forward. l'm going to need C-BIST.

47
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:43,677
Marshall and Johnson, you
come with me. Yes, sir.

48
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,721
Two shooters, Potts, Michaels.
l'm going to need EOD.

49
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:48,181
Conway, bring Simms also.
Right here, sir.

50
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:50,099
Ready, Chief.
All right, stand by.

51
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:53,436
Chief, l gotta talk to you.
This is fucked.

52
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:54,812
Listen, this is
a disaster.

53
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,939
lt is a disaster.
They haven't secured dick.

54
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,775
l don't think we should go in yet,
Chief. Let's get some acceptable intel.

55
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,944
No, no, no. Look at this! Jerry, l
got no idea what's coming out here.

56
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:04,904
l gotta go right now.

57
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,573
Keep comms open.
l'll be on five.

58
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,658
Get a second team ready.

59
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,284
Let's go! Move! Move!

60
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,869
Guys, get that shit
off the truck now.

61
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,829
Roger that.

62
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:14,914
C- BIST?
Right here, Chief.

63
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:17,416
l want you to stay right on the
backs of your shooters, all right?

64
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,168
They will take you in.
Roger that, Chief.

65
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:20,252
All right. We ready?

66
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:22,462
Yes, sir!
Let's go. Go! Go! Go!

67
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,214
Move! Move!

68
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:28,092
The sniper! Hey, Sarge! Where is he?

69
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:31,637
He's right up there, but
we can't get down the alley.

70
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:43,690
Okay, everyone,
listen up.

71
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:46,568
Michaels! Michaels,
listen. Hey!

72
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:51,072
The WMD are in this building. l need you
to work your way to the rear door here.

73
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:52,782
See if you can get
an angle on that sniper.

74
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,367
l want you to take C-BIST with you.
Take Simms, also, with the long rifle.

75
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,577
Got it, Chief.

76
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,537
Hey, l gotta get
across this alley.

77
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,788
l need some
cover fire, all right?

78
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:00,956
Okay.

79
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:04,459
When the 203 goes, we're going to
go all the way down on the left side.

80
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,794
All right. Stand by.
Roger that, Chief.

81
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:07,045
Let's go.

82
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:11,549
Met-Delta team, go!

83
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,802
Move, move! Let's go!

84
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,057
Move! Move!

85
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,782
l got him. He's on the fifth
floor, southeast corner room.

86
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:42,619
l'm going to draw him out.

87
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:44,704
As soon as you see him,
take him.

88
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:45,789
Roger.

89
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,087
Now! Now! Now!

90
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:04,306
Got him?

91
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,307
We got him.
Three coming out.

92
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:07,767
Michaels,
send C-BIST over.

93
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,268
Go! Go! Go!

94
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,648
Potts, Keating, go! Go!

95
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:20,904
Second team, move!
Let's go! Move! Move!

96
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,322
Move it!

97
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:27,577
ln.

98
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:33,749
Check. Check.
Let's do it.

99
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,419
All right. Break out the gear.
l want everyone in full MOPP.

100
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:40,881
Now you heard Chief. Get
ready. Roll those seals tight.

101
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:42,841
l got it.

102
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,547
No readings in here, Chief.

103
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,549
All right,
Conway, open it up.

104
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,690
Nothing but
toilet parts over here.

105
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,610
ls this all pigeon shit?

106
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:51,529
Yeah, thing looks like it's
been here about 10 years.

107
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:52,613
Yep.

108
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,159
This is no WMD site.

109
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,870
Pack it up.

110
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:03,248
Hey, Chief,
we find anything?

111
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,458
The site's empty.

112
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,502
Standing by.

113
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,473
Hey, where did that
intel come from?

114
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,434
Do you want me to double check the
target number for you? Because l can.

115
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:27,604
No, no, we're in the right
location. The schematic's right.

116
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:29,480
But who did it
originate with? l mean...

117
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:31,691
Hey, did this come
from the United Nations?

118
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:34,902
According to this data,
Chief, this is our intel.

119
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,865
Yeah, but how would they
think something was there?

120
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,493
This is the third
straight time.

121
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:45,662
Let's go.

122
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,497
You heard the chief.
Move out.

123
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:49,374
All right, pack this shit up
and let's go.

124
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:50,458
Roger that!

125
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,126
Let's go! Move!

126
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,503
Step on it. Let's go.

127
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,479
Zubaidi will be on the middle
chopper. Get tight on his exit.

128
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,741
Swing it around.
Swing it around.

129
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,576
The DOD guy's
here to meet him.

130
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,040
Reporting to you live
from the tarmac here...

131
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:41,838
Ready for the
close-up? Go, go, go!

132
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:44,424
That's Poundstone from DOD.

133
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:46,176
How's it going?

134
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,052
Great day.

135
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:50,555
Yup, you finally got him here.

136
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:54,016
Well, we feel like we're making
progress. That's important.

137
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:56,143
So, what about
the weapons?

138
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,688
l'm frustrated by that, too.

139
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:02,774
We're doing everything we can. We'll
find the weapons, don't worry about it.

140
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,902
The whole world's watching.
They want to know where they are.

141
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:08,696
Make sure Zubaidi and l
are in the lead car, okay?

142
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,031
Jack, l want
your guys to tail us.

143
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:11,115
You got it, sir.

144
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,533
Clark!
What?

145
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:15,244
l need the source.
l need Magellan.

146
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:19,123
Do you have any idea
how sensitive this is?

147
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,919
We've got Magellan locked up so tight,
l'm not even sure l can get to him.

148
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,131
You're the administration's go-to guy
and you can't access your own source?

149
00:11:28,214 --> 00:11:30,258
Lawrie, we're
debriefing him.

150
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,343
lt takes time.
That comes first.

151
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:36,430
For Christ's sake, l've given you
everything l got on the guy so far.

152
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:38,265
What more do you want? l
don't want to hear it from you,

153
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,392
l want to hear it from him.

154
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,352
l'll see what l can do.

155
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:46,523
How are you?

156
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,734
Welcome home, sir.
We'll make this very brief.

157
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,569
How does it feel to
be back, Mr. Zubaidi?

158
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,362
Did you ever think
you'd see this day?

159
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:57,449
l'm an Iraqi citizen, returning
free to the city of my birth.

160
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:02,037
l call on all Iraqis to celebrate
our liberation from tyranny.

161
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,585
Brayo one, we've got two
mechanics taking a look at it.

162
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:11,754
Tracking on the upgun
is pretty well shot

163
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,798
and the comm links
are all shorted out.

164
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:16,133
What's the time Frame
on a replacement?

165
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:30,480
l want
a squad list, now!

166
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:32,648
Hey, where's Colonel Bethel?

167
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:33,858
He's in the back, Chief.

168
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,234
Thank you.

169
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,652
Roy, let me meet you over here, okay?

170
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,404
Yeah, l'll meet you
in there.

171
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:42,532
Hey, sir.
Good to see you, Chief.

172
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:44,034
What's going on
with the intel?

173
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,577
You don't want to get
into that right now.

174
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,496
Well, we gotta talk about it. There's
nothing there. These sites are empty.

175
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,622
We're going to
be very careful,

176
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,707
or there's going to be a
huge shitstorm around here.

177
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,792
What do you mean?

178
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,627
They're blaming us
for not moving fast enough.

179
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,711
We have to stay on task.

180
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:58,630
That's bullshit.
The intel's no good.

181
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,340
Let's not make
any waves, okay?

182
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:02,300
They don't want to hear
that back in Washington.

183
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:05,637
All they're interested in is finding
something they can hold up on CNN.

184
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,056
Sir, but we gotta talk about
this. The intel is a problem.

185
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:09,849
Now is not
the time, Chief.

186
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:14,645
Roo!
On your feet!

187
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,985
Take your seats, people.

188
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:25,655
We're here this
morning to give the General

189
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,366
a check on where we are
in our search for WMD

190
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,952
and what our plans
are for the next 48 hours.

191
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:34,914
To that end, l'm turning the floor
over to Captain Jonathan Vaught.

192
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:36,540
Captain.
Sir.

193
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,750
Welcome, sir.

194
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:42,504
Today we're going to be briefing you
on WMD operations due to take place

195
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:45,882
in and around the Baghdad area
over the next 24 hours.

196
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,885
We're continuing to target
high-priority sites,

197
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:52,263
since all the folks back home are
anxiously awaiting the information

198
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:54,056
that we found these weapons.

199
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:56,684
We have a detailed media plan
we've worked out.

200
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,894
We've coordinated
with the public-affairs folks.

201
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:01,480
We have a good plan that
involves the top-rated media

202
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,190
in the United States
and the UK

203
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:07,193
so that they're prepared to cover
all aspects of the good news.

204
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,154
Yeah?
l had a couple questions

205
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:12,240
about the intel
for tomorrow.

206
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:14,450
Are we sure
this is accurate?

207
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,744
lt's solid.
It's good to go.

208
00:14:17,286 --> 00:14:18,787
What's the source?

209
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:21,081
Well, it's
a human-source intel.

210
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,293
But it's solid.
It's current as of 0400.

211
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:28,421
Was it the same source
we've been using?

212
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:31,424
Every site we've hit on the way
up here, we've rolled a donut.

213
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:36,136
Chief, how about we do this?
Let's talk offline.

214
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,347
Give me a list of the places
where you went, and the grids,

215
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:40,515
and we'll make sure that you had
the right information written down

216
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:41,641
and that you went to
the right places, okay?

217
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:45,353
Captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir.
The issue's that there's nothing there.

218
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:47,564
Stand down, Chief.
We need to move on here.

219
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:51,776
Don, hold on. Hold a second. Let's
hear what the chief has to say.

220
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:54,111
Okay, sir,
l'll give you an example.

221
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:56,822
We rolled into a site,
Diwaniya, last week, okay?

222
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,616
101st took casualties
securing it for us.

223
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,536
We got in there and found
it was a toilet factory.

224
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:03,995
l'm saying
there's a disconnect

225
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:08,207
between what's in these packets
and what we're seeing on the ground.

226
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,835
There's a problem
with the intelligence, sir.

227
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:12,670
Here's the thing, Chief.

228
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,422
These intelligence packages
have all been vetted.

229
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:16,924
They're good.

230
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:20,594
Your job's to execute them, not
worry about how they're put together.

231
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:22,554
Are we clear on that?

232
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,139
Yes, sir.

233
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,433
Good. Let's continue.

234
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:32,396
Sir, as l was saying, the intel
is as recent as 0400 this morning.

235
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:34,648
lt's actionable
and it's solid.

236
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:37,609
All right, next up is
Al Mansour, Baghdad.

237
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:40,612
lt looks like it's some kind
of underground storage site.

238
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:43,073
You got about 12 klicks of
open highway to the city,

239
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:44,407
but there's a lot
of activity on that road,

240
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:46,409
so tell everybody
to keep their heads up.

241
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:47,535
All right.

242
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:48,703
Chief?

243
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:50,496
All right. We're going to go chem. Yeah?

244
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:51,622
l'm gonna get all the
lead teams up, all right?

245
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:52,748
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,500
Martin Brown, CIA.

247
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:55,793
Roy Miller.

248
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,045
Yeah, l know. l saw you at the meeting.

249
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:00,505
You're going to the Al
Mansour site in Baghdad.

250
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,132
Yeah.
You're wasting your time.

251
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,509
UN biological team
hit it two months ago.

252
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:05,593
There's nothing there.

253
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:06,928
Fuck me.

254
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,640
Here's my card.
You're right.

255
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:12,808
This thing doesn't add up.

256
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,186
The Iraqis don't fight,
they don't use WMD,

257
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:18,605
they let us walk in here and
find the goddamn cupboard's bare.

258
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:20,440
There's something
wrong here.

259
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:22,651
We gotta figure
out what it is.

260
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,612
lf you find anything,
you've got my number.

261
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,673
That's aFFirmative.
That's affirmative.

262
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,300
We took on some fire
about four klicks back.

263
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,844
Pretty light, though.
Nothing to worry about.

264
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,025
Oh, l gotta get
some pictures of this.

265
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:08,651
Be my guest.

266
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,154
Heads up. Incoming.

267
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:13,823
Fucking Potts,
you red-headed dick.

268
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,293
Hey, Wilkins, this
is Chief. Get up here.

269
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:28,670
Hold on!

270
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,339
Yo, Kurry, let's go.

271
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:35,092
Please, get back. Please.

272
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,511
l want you to get a couple of the
guys and clear out this traffic.

273
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:40,013
We're too exposed out here.
We gotta keep moving.

274
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:42,307
Back from the truck.
Sir, take it easy.

275
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,391
Please.

276
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:45,560
Please, step aside.

277
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:47,061
l need you to move
the vehicle, sir.

278
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:48,229
Hey, hey, relax.

279
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:49,397
Easy!

280
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:52,233
Don't you
fucking touch me!

281
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:55,694
Motherfucker, let's go.

282
00:17:55,778 --> 00:17:57,196
Hey!
Shut the fuck up.

283
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,363
Back the fuck up!

284
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,365
Hey! Hey! Hey,
hey, hey, hey!

285
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:01,616
What's going on, Sergeant?

286
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,951
Chief, they're pissed off.

287
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,412
They say there ain't no
water. All they want is water.

288
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:06,996
There's nothing
we can do about that.

289
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,415
We iust gotta get
our vehicles moving.

290
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,168
l want you to get the men
back in the vehicles now.

291
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:15,087
Hey! Hey!
Get in the fucking car!

292
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,799
Get the fuck back! Get the
fuck back in your vehicle!

293
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:21,968
Back from the truck.
Get back from the truck.

294
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,348
Don't stop.
No, sir.

295
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay, so we're convening
an Iraqi Freedom convention

296
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,835
here inside
the Green Zone tomorrow.

297
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:02,631
We are expecting to have representatives
from all three main ethnic groups,

298
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:06,551
the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni,
angling for different levels of power.

299
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:09,345
lt is our hope
that Ahmed Zubaidi

300
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:12,390
will emerge in
a leadership position.

301
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:15,518
Ben, are you satisfied that
we're in a good place now?

302
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,353
l think we're
in a good place now,

303
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:20,814
except for, perhaps, the press we're
getting from this looting issue.

304
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:23,817
Okay, well,
let's table that for now.

305
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:25,068
ln terms of stabilization...

306
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:27,946
Zubaidi hasn't been
here for 30 years.

307
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:34,785
Well, he's the best bet we have
right now for a stable democracy.

308
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:37,913
You find me 10 guys in Baghdad
who even know who he is.

309
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:40,290
Well, he's our friend, Marty.
He's been very helpful.

310
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:41,958
Our office is
extremely satisfied

311
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:44,711
with all the information
that we've gotten from him.

312
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:47,213
Zubaidi's been selling us
a crock of shit for years.

313
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:50,299
This guy is not reliable. His
intelligence is not reliable.

314
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:52,093
His report chain
is not reliable.

315
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:55,596
This is exactly why people are losing
confidence in the Agency, Marty.

316
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:58,766
You're questioning every single piece
of intelligence that's coming in,

317
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,726
up to the point where
we can't make any progress.

318
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:03,645
You cannot just hand this country
over to an exile no one's ever heard of

319
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:05,563
and a bunch of interns
from Washington.

320
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,607
Well, you're
a Middle East expert, Marty.

321
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,777
lf you got a better idea, why don't
you just throw it out here on the table?

322
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,362
We need to use the
Iraqi army to help us.

323
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:16,490
This country is a powder
keg of ethnic division.

324
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,159
Now Saddam is gone, they're the only
ones who can hold this place together.

325
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:20,661
We're not selling that
to the American people.

326
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:22,454
We beat the Iraqi army.
Right.

327
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:23,997
Well, they're still out
there and they're armed,

328
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,582
and they're looking for
a place in the new Iraq.

329
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:27,083
They're going to be
waiting a long time.

330
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,918
They didn't all
follow Saddam.

331
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,670
There are officers
we can work with out there,

332
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:31,796
if we make it
worth their while.

333
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:33,297
Hey, let me tell
you something.

334
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:35,132
We've spent too
much American treasure

335
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:36,717
and too many American lives

336
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,136
for us to put a Ba'athist
general into a position of power.

337
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:43,098
Have you any idea what's going
on outside the Green Zone?

338
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:46,267
lt's chaos. No police,
revenge killings every night.

339
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:48,478
People are asking
why we can't stop this.

340
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,271
We are losing the population.
Democracy is messy.

341
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:51,939
Democracy is messy.

342
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:55,151
lf you dismantle this country
and cut out the army,

343
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,319
you'll have civil war
in six months.

344
00:20:57,361 --> 00:20:58,570
l guarantee it.

345
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,072
Okay, let's move on.

346
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:04,394
We are continuing to hold at the
intersection at Alpha-Charlie-three.

347
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:05,520
Calm down!

348
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:06,729
Listen to me, please!

349
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:08,189
Just listen.
Sergeant Wilkins!

350
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,777
Get on the ground!
My arm!

351
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,820
Hey, what's going on
over there, Wilkins?

352
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:17,573
Chief, there's a local here.
He's out of control.

353
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:18,782
Perry had to tackle him.

354
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:20,409
l'm on my way.

355
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:24,621
All right, back up.

356
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,165
You stay
the fuck down.

357
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,666
What's going on?
You are hurting me!

358
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:29,834
What's going on
here, Sergeant?

359
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:32,086
This Hajji says he needs to
talk to you about something.

360
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:33,921
l have no idea.
He goes on and on and on.

361
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:35,005
Stay down.

362
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,674
Why are you doing this?
Why you do it?

363
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:37,883
You agree someone
do this to you?

364
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,134
Hey, Perry. Perry.

365
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:40,260
You let him up.
Let him up.

366
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:41,386
You agree?

367
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,763
Up? l can stand up now?

368
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:47,642
Why you are doing this, huh?
Why you are doing this?

369
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,477
You agree someone put your
head in the dust like this?

370
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,021
You agree to be treated
like this? This is not fair!

371
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,439
Hey, calm down.

372
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:57,026
l'm trying to calm down, but
this guy, he put me on the floor!

373
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,735
Are you finished?

374
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:01,947
Yeah, l'm finished.

375
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,073
What's your name?

376
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:06,993
My name is Farid Youssef Abdul
Rahman. You call me Freddy, okay?

377
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:10,163
l have information. l was driving
like five minutes from here.

378
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:14,583
l saw some people, you know, like
Saddam's men, like Ba'athist people.

379
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:17,211
They are meeting. They
have a meeting near to here.

380
00:24:17,252 --> 00:24:19,046
l saw you are... l don't
know, you're digging here,

381
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:21,089
and l come to tell you. Okay,
just calm down. Hey! Hey! Hey!

382
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:23,133
Calm down. Calm down.

383
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,176
Why should l believe
you, Freddy?

384
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:27,845
You think it's easy to come
and talk to American?

385
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:30,765
You think it's easy? l come here, all
these people, they're looking at me?

386
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:33,017
You stick me on the floor. l
want to speak to you quietly, huh.

387
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,185
And you are
digging in the ground.

388
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:35,769
Why you are digging
in the ground?

389
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:38,605
You need to talk to these people.
You know what they are saying?

390
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:41,775
You think someone can put
something in this place

391
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:44,736
with all these people watching
and all these people don't know?

392
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:46,446
lt's not logical.

393
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:50,616
l am here to help you,
okay, Miller?

394
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,455
Come with me, Freddy.
Come with me.

395
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,581
Chief, you good?

396
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,082
Yeah, l'm fine.

397
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,043
Sir, come
this way, please.

398
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,879
Hey, Chief! Chief,
what are we doing?

399
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,007
Hey, l'm gonna need his car keys.
Freddy, give him your car keys.

400
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,133
My keys?

401
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,219
Chief, you don't believe
this guy, do you?

402
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,346
Look, l wanna go
real low-vis on this.

403
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,807
l want to take Freddy's car and
l want to get maybe one other.

404
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,769
lf we roll over there in those
Humvees, they're going to see us coming.

405
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,522
l want to take Keating,
Potts, Bronner on comms.

406
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,232
You gotta get me Michaels with
the SAW and bring Perry over here.

407
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,358
What's up, Chief?

408
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,484
Hey, you guys
ready to go to work?

409
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,610
Hell, yeah, Chief.

410
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,529
Chief, let me talk
to you, please.

411
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,613
What?

412
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,365
Chief, our mission is here.

413
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:38,035
What, you wanna sit around
and dig holes all day?

414
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:39,786
l want to get
something done.

415
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:45,125
All right,
here's the situation.

416
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,043
This Iraqi just showed
up with information

417
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:48,753
that about two
or three "K" west of here,

418
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:50,421
there's a meeting
taking place right now,

419
00:25:50,463 --> 00:25:52,423
possible high-value
targets involved.

420
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:53,883
So l want to move on it.

421
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:57,386
ln the first car, l want to
take the Iraqi guy, freddy.

422
00:25:57,428 --> 00:25:59,388
Keating, you're going
to drive, l'll ride shotgun.

423
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,723
Potts, you're in the back
covering Freddy the entire time.

424
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:04,267
The rest of you guys are going to roll
in the pick-up truck. Any questions?

425
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:08,896
Hey, Chief, how do we know this guy
isn't leading us into a fucking ambush?

426
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,314
We don't.

427
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,859
Get your fucking game face on.

428
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:16,695
Roger.

429
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,697
Hooah.
Hooah!

430
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:20,699
All right, let's roll. You're
not letting me drive, huh?

431
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:22,033
No, you're not driving.

432
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:23,535
Weapons ready.

433
00:26:24,077 --> 00:26:27,580
lt's Freddy, right? l'm
Potts. Nice to meet you.

434
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:29,123
Fire it up!

435
00:28:21,226 --> 00:28:23,562
Okay, Sergeant Perry, l want
you to carry on straight.

436
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:26,397
Take your next left, take your
next left and go around the back.

437
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:28,149
Roger that, Chief.

438
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:33,154
And if you stop here, it
is the house on that corner.

439
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:35,656
Okay, pull up here. Pull up here.

440
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:39,660
Okay, be advised, it is the
house on the southeast corner.

441
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:42,245
The big white house
with the wall.

442
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,332
Heads up.
Someone's coming out.

443
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:48,209
There were six or
seven men with guns.

444
00:28:51,712 --> 00:28:55,633
All right, we got a guy with a
briefcase and another with an AK-47.

445
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:58,510
Perry, where are you?
You in position?

446
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,431
In position,
Chief. We got them.

447
00:29:02,514 --> 00:29:04,599
Black BMW with three men.

448
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:05,809
l want to take the BMW.

449
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:07,685
As soon as he comes up our
way, we're going to cut him off.

450
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,230
l want to take the BMW and
then the house. Go, go, go.

451
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:20,197
Go, go, go!

452
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,240
Out of the fucking car! Get
the fuck out of the car, now!

453
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:24,451
Perry, get on that door.

454
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:26,453
Get on that door.

455
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:27,996
Zip him up.
Bronner, stay with him.

456
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,414
Everybody else,
go, go, go, go, go!

457
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:30,706
On me. Stack on me.

458
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,854
Let's go!
Let's go! Go, go, go!

459
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,149

00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:05,775
What l have to do
for you to believe me?

618
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,318
Get everyone
back to the trucks.

619
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:08,653
Roger.

620
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:11,239
Hey, let's go.
Let's go.

621
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,991
What more l have to do
for you? Huh?

622
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:18,871
l come to you with information. You
take the information, it's right.

623
00:39:18,912 --> 00:39:21,498
You want the book. l have
the book. l give you the book.

624
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:24,250
You think l can
leave my car?

625
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,753
You know what this car
it means to me?

626
00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:28,755
Even you have the key!

627
00:39:40,724 --> 00:39:42,851
What happened to your leg?

628
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:46,062
My leg is in Iran.

629
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:48,273
Since 1987.

630
00:39:49,607 --> 00:39:51,734
Me, too, l fight
for my country.

631
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:54,528
Freddy, listen. You
give me your information.

632
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:56,655
l'm going to get you a
reward for what you did today.

633
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:57,990
Reward?

634
00:39:59,783 --> 00:40:02,035
You think l do
this for money?

635
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:05,872
You think l don't care about my
country? l see what's happening.

636
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:08,625
You don't think l see
what's happen in it?

637
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,501
And all the people now,
even they have no water,

638
00:40:10,585 --> 00:40:11,627
they have no electricity.

639
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:13,504
You think l do this
for reward?

640
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:16,006
You don't think
l do this for me?

641
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,635
For my future? For my
country? For all these things?

642
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:23,180
Whatever you want here,
l want more than you want.

643
00:40:23,263 --> 00:40:25,390
l want to help my country.

644
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:42,739
Who is this?

645
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:44,074
Hey, this is Chief Miller.

646
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:46,701
l have something l think
you'd be interested in.

647
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:50,413
Listen, l don't have time to play
games. Just tell me what you've got.

648
00:40:50,455 --> 00:40:54,041
Well, this morning l came face
to face with Mohammed Al Rawi.

649
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,502
General Al Rawi?

650
00:40:56,543 --> 00:40:57,878
Yeah, the Jack of Clubs.

651
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,046
Come in
and talk to me.

652
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,923
l'm in the Green Zone,
Republican Palace. By the pool.

653
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:04,217
l'm on my way. Listen, make
sure Johnson runs checks...

654
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:07,220
Hey, Sergeant Wilkins,
l gotta talk to you.

655
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:09,889
We gotta go get our prisoner
back, find this guy, Al Rawi.

656
00:41:09,972 --> 00:41:11,140
Let Bethel handle it, please.

657
00:41:11,224 --> 00:41:13,517
No. Bethel can't see past
the files on his desk.

658
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:14,852
So, what, you're going to ring
the doorbell now

659
00:41:14,935 --> 00:41:16,478
and ask Special Forces
to hand him over? No.

660
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:18,272
l'm going to use the book and
trade up and get some help.

661
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:19,398
What are you
talking about?

662
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:22,442
Jerry, why the fuck do we keep
coming up empty on all these sites?

663
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:23,610
There has gotta
be a reason.

664
00:41:23,902 --> 00:41:25,862
Chief, we're here to do
a job and get home safe.

665
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:27,739
That's all.
The reasons don't matter.

666
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,615
They matter to me.

667
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:35,412
With all due respect, Chief,
l can't go with you on this.

668
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,665
Understood. l'm going
to split the team.

669
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,292
l'm going to take my crew
plus Sergeant Perry.

670
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,086
You report back to Bethel
with everyone else, hooah?

671
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,254
Hooah.

672
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:49,384
Hey, Freddy.
You want a job?

673
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:52,511
Yes.

674
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,305
Good. Get in your car,
follow us.

675
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,389
Where to, Chief?

676
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,974
Republican Palace.

677
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,446
This is not
a good time, Lawrie.

678
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,781
l've waited
long enough.

679
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,075
l told you,
l'm doing the best l can.

680
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,535
This is not what
l signed up for, Clark.

681
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,996
l put my reputation on the
line with these stories.

682
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,998
l am not going to let
you hang me out to dry.

683
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:24,249
Well, there's huge
things at stake here.

684
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,210
l'm not going to let them be compromised
because you need to sell some newspapers.

685
00:42:27,293 --> 00:42:30,588
You knew the deal. l give you
Magellan, you give me anonymity.

686
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:34,508
Listen, Clark, l'm done
waiting, so is the paper.

687
00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:39,429
You won't help me find Magellan,
l'm going to find someone who can.

688
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:01,491
Right here.

689
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:39,484
Can you get me
some more beers? Frisbee!

690
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:40,902
Oh, shit!

691
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,411
Oh, my goodness.
We got enough time for that?

692
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:53,581
These guys got Domino's
Pizza and fucking beer?

693
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:55,833
Get in the pool, man.

694
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:57,543
Sergeant Perry, l've gotta
go talk to this guy,

695
00:43:57,584 --> 00:43:59,169
so you all are on your own
for a little while.

696
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:00,545
Roger that.

697
00:44:00,629 --> 00:44:01,671
Can we have beer?

698
00:44:01,713 --> 00:44:03,006
Not one.

699
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,060
So, what happened?

700
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:17,853
We were digging at a site.

701
00:44:17,936 --> 00:44:21,314
Local come up to us and give us a
tip that there was a meeting going on

702
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:23,441
with some high-value
targets nearby.

703
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:26,653
We hit the house, and it turned out
the guy was right. Al Rawi was there.

704
00:44:26,694 --> 00:44:28,655
You sure it was him?
Positive.

705
00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:31,407
He had a security detail with him,
and we exchanged fire with them

706
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:34,285
and he slipped out
during the firefight.

707
00:44:40,123 --> 00:44:43,043
Now that's the book that l
took off this guy, Seyyed Hamza.

708
00:44:43,084 --> 00:44:44,461
He was the host
of the meeting.

709
00:44:44,544 --> 00:44:46,713
And l was in the process of
figuring out what the fuck it was

710
00:44:46,754 --> 00:44:49,298
when SF showed up
and snatched him.

711
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:51,926
God damn!

712
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:53,719
Okay, but where
did they take him?

713
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,971
Because if you can get me
access to this guy,

714
00:44:56,055 --> 00:44:57,723
l'll get Al Rawi.

715
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:03,812
Look, we're both
after the WMD, right?

716
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:07,649
lt's a little more
complicated than that.

717
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,442
Well, not to me, it isn't.

718
00:45:12,028 --> 00:45:14,697
All right, l'll make a
call get you reassig! ned.

719
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,324
There are some empty buildings
on the other side of the compound.

720
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:19,785
Get out of uniform and report
to my office in an hour.

721
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:21,328
Outstanding.

722
00:45:33,506 --> 00:45:35,883
How'd you get
the bloody nose?

723
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:39,052
Oh, that's a long story.

724
00:45:39,761 --> 00:45:42,806
You're in the 85th.
That's WMD unit, right?

725
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,766
How did you know that?

726
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,601
lt's right there
on your rifle.

727
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:50,271
Lawrie Dayne, Wall Street
Journal. How's it going?

728
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:55,359
You know, we haven't found
shit yet. Hey, Sergeant Perry.

729
00:45:55,401 --> 00:45:57,403
We'll find it.
It's frustrating, right?

730
00:45:57,486 --> 00:45:58,612
Little bit.

731
00:45:58,695 --> 00:46:01,531
So what are you
and Marty talking about?

732
00:46:02,574 --> 00:46:03,867
Oh, you know l can't
talk to you about that.

733
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,452
Oh, come on.

734
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:08,705
You come in fresh off the field to
have a lemonade with Martin Brown?

735
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:11,082
Something's gotta be going on.

736
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,834
Well, you could ask him.

737
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:15,211
l'm asking you.

738
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:18,714
Does it make sense to you that
we're still coming up empty?

739
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:23,426
No. No, it doesn't.

740
00:46:24,344 --> 00:46:26,888
Someone told us
they were there, right?

741
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:32,226
lf you come
across anything,

742
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:35,479
call me.

743
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:39,983
l'll keep it in mind.

744
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:12,026
Where's he hiding?
Where's Al Rawi?

745
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:14,695
Where's Al Rawi?

746
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,530
How long have
they been going?

747
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:17,865
For about 10 minutes.

748
00:48:17,948 --> 00:48:20,492
You want to see your wife and
kids again? You have five kids.

749
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:22,160
You want them
to see their father?

750
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:26,164
He says, "Please, do not involve
my family in this situation. "

751
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:28,750
"l swear to God... "

752
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:31,419
You're involved,
so your family's involved.

753
00:48:31,502 --> 00:48:34,338
All l want is an answer,
where to look for this man,

754
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,715
and you can walk out of here.

755
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:38,467
Where's Al Rawi?
Where's Al Rawi?

756
00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:41,303
And l want
a name or an address.

757
00:48:41,803 --> 00:48:44,639
Somewhere l can find
General Al Rawi.

758
00:48:45,181 --> 00:48:46,766
l am going
to get an answer,

759
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,936
and you know you're going
to tell me something.

760
00:48:49,977 --> 00:48:54,440
All right, l'm going to let go and
you're going to give me an address.

761
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:58,235
Where's Al Rawi?
Where is he?

762
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,153
The book! The book!

763
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:01,863
He says you need the book.

764
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:04,366
The fucking book again?
What's in the book?

765
00:49:04,407 --> 00:49:06,743
"The book,
that's how you'll find him. "

766
00:49:06,826 --> 00:49:10,413
lt has the names and locations
of Al Rawi's safe houses.

767
00:49:25,844 --> 00:49:27,428
Chief Miller around?

768
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:30,223
Yeah. Up the stairs,
down on the right.

769
00:49:40,941 --> 00:49:44,527
Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone,
Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.

770
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:46,613
A great job bagging Hamza.

771
00:49:46,863 --> 00:49:48,531
Thanks. Appreciate it.

772
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:50,116
Walk you out?

773
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:51,951
Sure.

774
00:49:52,118 --> 00:49:53,994
You're with our MET Team, right? Yeah.

775
00:49:54,078 --> 00:49:57,039
Well, the administration really
appreciates the work you guys are doing.

776
00:49:57,081 --> 00:49:59,249
We gotta get this WMD
issue behind us

777
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:02,169
so we can get on with the
challenges of the future.

778
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:03,920
That's where this Hamza
guy could be helpful.

779
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:05,797
He's confirmed
a few facts for us.

780
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,175
Says your guys might have
lifted a notebook from him.

781
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:11,886
Well, everything l got off
him l gave to Martin Brown.

782
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:13,596
Why don't you ask him
if he's got it?

783
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,181
l don't think Marty
would go for that.

784
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:17,641
He's a hell of a guy, but he's
been in the Middle East a long time.

785
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:20,185
He's got a lot of
preconceived ideas.

786
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:22,395
Our unit's trying to get
back to the raw intel.

787
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,689
Look, l don't want
to throw Marty under a bus,

788
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:26,566
but he doesn't like
what we're coming up with.

789
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:27,692
The guy's a dinosaur,

790
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:31,320
and we need to get some new
thinking going on around here.

791
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,281
There's an opportunity
for you here, Miller.

792
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,783
l know Marty's pulled
you in temporarily,

793
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:39,786
but if you're looking for something
more permanent, l can help.

794
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,958
We're doing a good thing here.
We're going to rebuild this place.

795
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,001
People are watching us.

796
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:51,464
l'll keep it in mind.

797
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:52,882
You do that.

798
00:50:53,382 --> 00:50:56,885
lf you hear anything about
that notebook, let me know.

1
00:51:00,076 --> 00:51:04,205
Your friend from the Pentagon Special
Intelligence Unit came to see me.

2
00:51:04,247 --> 00:51:05,248
Poundstone?

3
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:06,582
Yeah, Poundstone.

4
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:10,211
Poundstone's unit pushed all that WMD
intel you've been chasing your tail on.

5
00:51:10,253 --> 00:51:11,921
What? You mean Magellan?

6
00:51:12,004 --> 00:51:13,714
Who is Magellan?
Have you ever met him?

7
00:51:13,756 --> 00:51:14,882
No.

8
00:51:14,924 --> 00:51:16,717
Poundstone's got him
locked up tight.

9
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:19,720
That's why we gotta
find out what's going on.

10
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:21,055
Here's the deal.

11
00:51:21,097 --> 00:51:22,265
We checked the notebook.

12
00:51:22,306 --> 00:51:24,934
lt's a list of addresses
around Baghdad, mostly Adhamiya.

13
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:27,979
lt's a Sunni stronghold,
very sympathetic to the army.

14
00:51:28,062 --> 00:51:30,106
More than likely,
that's where Al Rawi is.

15
00:51:30,189 --> 00:51:32,608
The notebook's probably his
line to his battalion commanders.

16
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:33,693
We all set?

17
00:51:33,776 --> 00:51:35,570
Not yet. We're waiting
on military support.

18
00:51:35,611 --> 00:51:39,073
Push them hard. l want to get
every address in that book.

19
00:51:39,115 --> 00:51:40,700
So, what do you think
that meeting was about?

20
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:43,244
What would you be talking
about if you just got invaded?

21
00:51:43,286 --> 00:51:45,496
You think Al Rawi
wants to fight?

22
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,832
lf we don't make him
an offer, he will.

23
00:51:47,915 --> 00:51:49,917
What? You're going
to cut a deal?

24
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:53,129
You're going to cut a deal
with the Jack of Clubs?

25
00:51:54,297 --> 00:51:56,465
What do you think
you're doing here, Miller?

26
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:58,467
You're off reservation
for a reason. What is it?

27
00:51:58,551 --> 00:52:01,512
Well, l came to find
weapons and save lives.

28
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:03,389
And l didn't find shit.

29
00:52:03,472 --> 00:52:05,099
l want to know why.

30
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:08,144
There are no easy answers. If you
want that, go work with Poundstone.

31
00:52:08,186 --> 00:52:10,188
All we got is hard choices.

32
00:52:10,271 --> 00:52:11,856
You want to know what
happened to the weapons?

33
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:14,192
We gotta find Al Rawi
and bring him in.

34
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:15,943
He'll give us
the truth about WMD

35
00:52:15,985 --> 00:52:20,156
and give us a shot at standing
this country up without a bloodbath.

36
00:52:20,865 --> 00:52:22,992
Do you want the job or not?

37
00:52:25,995 --> 00:52:27,997
Yeah, l want it.
Good.

38
00:52:29,457 --> 00:52:32,210
Hamza's being held at the high-value
target wing at Camp Cropper.

39
00:52:32,293 --> 00:52:34,212
Poundstone's unit
have him under wraps.

40
00:52:34,295 --> 00:52:36,714
So, how are you going
to get to him?

41
00:52:36,797 --> 00:52:38,507
l'm not. You are.

42
00:52:39,217 --> 00:52:40,551
Here's a pass.

43
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:44,430
We've got another prisoner
there we can use to get you in.

44
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:47,558
Low-level Republican Guard,
way below their radar.

45
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:50,519
Use him as an excuse
to get to Hamza.

46
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:52,438
Here's a million
dollars in cash.

47
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:55,149
Tell Hamza the money's his
if he gives us what we need.

48
00:52:55,316 --> 00:52:58,152
You tell him if
he gives Al Rawi to me,

49
00:52:58,194 --> 00:53:00,821
keeps his mouth shut over
there until l bring him in,

50
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:04,659
l'll have him and his family out of
the country by the end of the week.

51
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,703
You want me to tell him to not
talk to the American interrogators?

52
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:09,330
That's right.

53
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:14,543
l thought we were
all on the same side.

54
00:53:14,627 --> 00:53:16,212
Don't be naive.

55
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:41,987
Miller.

56
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:44,448
Pentagon iust
revoked your transfer.

57
00:53:44,532 --> 00:53:48,494
You're being released back to
your unit, effective immediately.

58
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:51,831
You chose the wrong side.

59
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:01,465
Follow me, Freddy.
We gotta move fast.

60
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:04,009
Where do you think you're going?

61
00:54:04,093 --> 00:54:07,138
Let us through.
Step aside, please.

62
00:54:10,057 --> 00:54:13,269
What the hell are you
playing at? Get me Langley.

63
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,271
You are required
to hand over all information.

64
00:54:15,312 --> 00:54:18,357
White House authorization.
l want the book.

65
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:31,620
DC's got too much riding on this to have
you and some Ba'athist generals fuck it up.

66
00:54:32,621 --> 00:54:33,914
Martin.

67
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:35,958
Langley confirms.

68
00:54:37,835 --> 00:54:39,253
l've got it!

69
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:46,260
Let's go.
Stay out of this, Marty.

70
00:54:48,304 --> 00:54:49,972
You all right here?
Yeah.

71
00:55:00,483 --> 00:55:02,193
Use local assets.

72
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:04,945
lt's high priority.

73
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,785
Stay close
to me, Freddy.

74
00:55:54,954 --> 00:55:56,538
Put him down.

75
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:01,543
OGA.

76
00:56:01,627 --> 00:56:03,796
l'm here to see
a prisoner.

77
00:56:09,635 --> 00:56:11,220
Heads up, Sarge.
Hey, Sergeant.

78
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:12,513
Hello, sir.

79
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:17,184
l'm here to see
Abdullah Ferat.

80
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:19,687
l'm gonna have
to search your bag.

81
00:56:19,728 --> 00:56:21,063
What's up with Hajji?

82
00:56:21,105 --> 00:56:22,898
He's my translator.

83
00:56:26,151 --> 00:56:28,070
Arms up,
legs apart.

84
00:56:40,457 --> 00:56:41,667
Check it out.

85
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,544
What's that
in your pocket?

86
00:56:43,585 --> 00:56:45,379
It's my cigarettes.

87
00:56:46,922 --> 00:56:48,716
Good to go.
Here you go, sir.

88
00:56:48,757 --> 00:56:51,385
Go ahead and take
them back to IR-1.

89
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:08,569
Right here.

90
00:57:30,299 --> 00:57:31,925
That's not
necessary, Sergeant.

91
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:33,927
Standard procedure, sir.

92
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:43,312
Sergeant, l have to have a classified
conversation with the prisoner.

93
00:57:43,395 --> 00:57:44,605
You can go on
and step outside.

94
00:57:44,646 --> 00:57:47,065
Roger, sir.
Be right outside.

95
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:13,342
Do you know why
they brought him here?

96
00:58:16,011 --> 00:58:19,431
He's here because he's in
the Republican Guard, Freddy.

97
00:58:19,723 --> 00:58:21,350
Hey, Sergeant.

98
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:24,686
Hey, listen, this guy just
gave us a piece of intel.

99
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,357
You apparently have a prisoner in
your HVT wing here named Seyyed Hamza.

100
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,525
He can ID him for me.

101
00:58:29,608 --> 00:58:31,693
l gotta get him down here
and ID him real quick.

102
00:58:31,777 --> 00:58:34,363
You're going to need
an EJ-75 for that, man.

103
00:58:34,446 --> 00:58:35,530
Guys, l got a live op going.

104
00:58:35,572 --> 00:58:38,033
l got a team in place ready to move
on a target. l gotta do this now.

105
00:58:38,075 --> 00:58:39,076
How long will it take?

106
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:40,202
Two minutes.

107
00:58:40,244 --> 00:58:42,329
Just two minutes? That's
it. Two minutes. Come on.

108
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,373
All right. Good, let's go. Hey, Freddy.

109
00:58:48,085 --> 00:58:50,337
Put those bags
on their heads.

110
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:03,058
OGA coming in
for an ID check.

111
00:59:18,991 --> 00:59:20,367
Hey, Hamza.

112
00:59:20,575 --> 00:59:21,785
Get up.

113
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,289
Shit.

114
00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:30,168
Get a medic!

115
00:59:33,213 --> 00:59:34,923
l said, get a medic!

116
00:59:35,424 --> 00:59:39,219
Hey, get the medics on the
phone. We've got a situation here.

117
00:59:40,595 --> 00:59:43,348
He say, "Why did you
do this to me?"

118
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:49,980
He say the general did everything
you ask of him in the meeting.

119
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:52,941
What do you...
What meeting?

120
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:55,610
What meeting?

121
01:00:02,284 --> 01:00:04,119
He just say Jordan.

122
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:05,620
Clear the way!
Clear the way!

123
01:00:05,704 --> 01:00:06,747
What is going
on here, Miller?

124
01:00:06,788 --> 01:00:08,790
Coming through! Okay.

125
01:00:10,042 --> 01:00:12,294
What does
he mean, "Jordan"?

126
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:20,927
We gotta stop the
bleeding. His pulse is weak.

127
01:02:35,603 --> 01:02:38,189
l need to talk to you
about Magellan.

128
01:02:40,025 --> 01:02:42,402
l'm going to call you
right back.

129
01:02:43,445 --> 01:02:44,904
What you got?

130
01:02:47,115 --> 01:02:48,658
l read your articles.

131
01:02:48,742 --> 01:02:51,703
You said an Iraqi WMD
source named Magellan

132
01:02:51,786 --> 01:02:54,372
met with US officials
prior to the war.

133
01:02:54,456 --> 01:02:56,166
l need to know
about that meeting.

134
01:02:56,249 --> 01:02:59,502
Oh, no. Come on, Miller. l can't
discuss my sources with you.

135
01:02:59,586 --> 01:03:03,465
Well, did you ever meet the
guy? Do you know who he is?

136
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:07,135
Of course l didn't meet him. He's
an Iraqi internal, for Christ's sake.

137
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:10,305
Then how do you know
what he's saying is true?

138
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:15,310
Because l made contact through
a reliable intermediary.

139
01:03:15,393 --> 01:03:16,978
Reliable?
Yes.

140
01:03:18,897 --> 01:03:22,150
Have you ever even been
to any of Magellan's sites?

141
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:25,195
You ever been
to Diwaniya? Tikrit?

142
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:28,907
No.

143
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,116
There's nothing there.

144
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:33,661
Magellan's intel
is bullshit.

145
01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:38,708
Who's the intermediary?

146
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:40,668
No. l'm not discussing
sources, Miller.

147
01:03:40,752 --> 01:03:43,838
Jesus Christ! This is
the reason we went to war!

148
01:03:50,428 --> 01:03:53,181
All right, then at least
tell me how it happened.

149
01:03:53,223 --> 01:03:54,307
How does this happen?

150
01:03:54,349 --> 01:03:57,685
How does somebody like you
write something that's not true?

151
01:03:57,727 --> 01:03:59,020
Tell me!

152
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:02,857
What do you know?

153
01:04:09,364 --> 01:04:14,994
Look, l got a phone call one
day from a senior official in DC.

154
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:18,081
He says,
"l've got a story for you.

155
01:04:18,164 --> 01:04:20,875
"The truth about
Saddam's WMD programs. "

156
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:22,961
So l go to meet him.

157
01:04:23,795 --> 01:04:26,548
He puts the source
report in my hands.

158
01:04:27,215 --> 01:04:29,676
Magellan's product,
the raw intel.

159
01:04:30,718 --> 01:04:33,012
But when do you
check the story?

160
01:04:35,932 --> 01:04:38,184
He was a senior official,
for Christ's sake.

161
01:04:38,226 --> 01:04:40,853
He had access
to Magellan's debrief.

162
01:04:40,895 --> 01:04:45,066
All he asked was that l not
disclose the location of the meeting.

163
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:47,402
The location.

164
01:04:47,443 --> 01:04:49,821
Yes, in case l'd
compromise the source.

165
01:04:51,573 --> 01:04:53,658
lt was Jordan, wasn't it?

166
01:04:55,034 --> 01:04:57,120
The meeting was in Jordan.

167
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:02,834
Yes.

168
01:05:16,347 --> 01:05:18,808
You can keep
your million dollars.

169
01:05:19,267 --> 01:05:21,102
Al Rawi's Magellan.

170
01:05:22,312 --> 01:05:25,940
They're debriefing Magellan.
They've got him held tight.

171
01:05:26,316 --> 01:05:28,234
Supposing they don't?

172
01:05:31,446 --> 01:05:33,740
John, take care
of the money.

173
01:05:34,282 --> 01:05:37,368
Hamza said Al Rawi met
US officials in Jordan.

174
01:05:37,452 --> 01:05:39,162
Now Dayne said the same
thing about Magellan.

175
01:05:39,454 --> 01:05:41,247
That's more
than a coincidence.

176
01:05:41,289 --> 01:05:43,958
Maybe. It doesn't
make any sense.

177
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:46,794
lf Poundstone met Al Rawi
in Jordan, what's he hiding?

178
01:05:46,836 --> 01:05:50,465
Well, what if he told him
something he didn't wanna hear?

179
01:05:50,506 --> 01:05:53,176
What if he told him
there were no WMD?

180
01:05:57,722 --> 01:05:59,766
l want Al Rawi's
movements outside Iraq.

181
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,101
January, February, 2003.
Anything you got.

182
01:06:02,143 --> 01:06:03,603
l'm on it.

183
01:06:05,188 --> 01:06:07,148
lt all makes sense.
The bad intel.

184
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,567
Why our teams came up
empty at those sites.

185
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,862
Maybe we're looking at this
thing the wrong way around.

186
01:06:12,945 --> 01:06:14,489
lt's a theory.

187
01:06:15,865 --> 01:06:16,991
You've got no proof.

188
01:06:17,075 --> 01:06:18,493
Don't be naive.

189
01:06:21,537 --> 01:06:25,666
Sir, Mohammed Al Rawi was in
Amman, Jordan on February 5th, 2003.

190
01:06:27,668 --> 01:06:30,671
That's three days before
Magellan came online.

191
01:06:33,049 --> 01:06:35,093
Give me Clark Poundstone's
movements, same period.

192
01:06:39,847 --> 01:06:42,517
Sir, we've got a DOD
Gulfstream on the same date.

193
01:06:42,558 --> 01:06:46,354
Passenger Clark Poundstone routed
Washington, DC to Amman, Jordan.

194
01:06:46,395 --> 01:06:50,441
Martin, we're getting reports of
an attack on an Al Rawi safe house.

195
01:06:50,525 --> 01:06:52,068
South Adhamiya.

196
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:55,655
Poundstone's hunting Al Rawi. He
doesn't want the truth to get out.

197
01:06:55,696 --> 01:06:58,116
l need to know where
the next safe house is.

198
01:08:15,943 --> 01:08:17,695
All clear, Chief.

199
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:20,656
Send Freddy!

200
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,743
Yes, sir!
Freddy, on the move.

201
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,958
Freddy, l need you
to translate.

202
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,461
Tell him l need to get a
message to General Al Rawi.

203
01:08:35,796 --> 01:08:37,798
Tell him l need
to meet Al Rawi tonight.

204
01:08:45,014 --> 01:08:46,140
Chief Miller on the
phone for you, sir.

205
01:08:47,141 --> 01:08:48,934
Yeah?
l got him.

206
01:08:48,976 --> 01:08:52,646
Tahir al-Malik, one of Al
Rawi's battalion commanders.

207
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,690
Where is he?
l let him go.

208
01:08:54,774 --> 01:08:57,276
Look, l told him to get
a message to Al Rawi.

209
01:08:57,318 --> 01:09:01,072
l told him l'd meet him at the
Adhamiya bus station tonight.

210
01:09:01,155 --> 01:09:03,657
lf l can bring him in alive,
then we'll have our proof.

211
01:09:03,699 --> 01:09:06,827
lf he talks, then we'll
get the truth about WMD.

212
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:10,831
All right, if you get in front of Al
Rawi, offer him whatever you have to.

213
01:09:10,873 --> 01:09:11,916
lf you pull this off,

214
01:09:11,999 --> 01:09:14,043
there's still a chance we can
hold this place together.

215
01:09:14,126 --> 01:09:15,920
l'm headed there now.

216
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:19,799
You are serious to do a
deal with Mohammed Al Rawi?

217
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,760
You know what already
he do to this country?

218
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:27,139
We're iust trying
to save lives, Freddy.

219
01:09:27,181 --> 01:09:30,601
There are people who think
he can stop an insurgency.

220
01:09:31,477 --> 01:09:33,270
All right, listen up,
we're going to Adhamiya.

221
01:09:33,354 --> 01:09:36,023
But look, we're going alone,
so weapons check, comms check.

222
01:09:36,107 --> 01:09:38,109
Make sure you're 100%.
We got no support.

223
01:09:38,192 --> 01:09:39,693
Hooah?
Hooah!

224
01:09:39,735 --> 01:09:41,195
You okay? Sergeant P,
can l get a radio check?

225
01:09:41,237 --> 01:09:42,905
Go to one.
Miller, what you are doing?

226
01:09:42,988 --> 01:09:44,365
Channel one.
Roger that.

227
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:46,450
Look at what's happening.

228
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:54,792
l just need you to do
your job tonight, Freddy.

229
01:10:00,339 --> 01:10:01,715
Let's roll!

230
01:11:22,421 --> 01:11:26,550
Thank you all very much.
Admiral Kelly, Captain Card,

231
01:11:26,634 --> 01:11:30,387
officers and sailors
of the USS Abraham Lincoln,

232
01:11:31,138 --> 01:11:32,931
my fellow Americans.

233
01:11:33,641 --> 01:11:36,560
Maior combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

234
01:11:37,144 --> 01:11:38,979
ln the battle of Iraq,

235
01:11:39,063 --> 01:11:42,650
the United States and
our allies have prevailed.

236
01:11:43,192 --> 01:11:44,652
All right!

237
01:11:56,789 --> 01:11:58,332
Yeah?
This is Briggs.

238
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:00,250
We got a problem.

239
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:02,252
My local assets are down.

240
01:12:02,336 --> 01:12:06,090
l got a report saying it was US Army
took them out and nobody called it in.

241
01:12:06,173 --> 01:12:07,633
Where's Miller?

242
01:12:08,175 --> 01:12:09,259
Stand by.

243
01:12:10,052 --> 01:12:13,347
All right, listen up. l need
everybody on a Blue Force Tracker.

244
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,349
Met-Delta 85th, XTF.

245
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:26,777
Sir.

246
01:12:36,078 --> 01:12:37,955
He's moving northwest
towards Adhamiya.

247
01:12:38,038 --> 01:12:39,248
ETA?
Twelve minutes, sir.

248
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:40,791
ETA, 12 minutes.

249
01:12:42,543 --> 01:12:44,711
He's meeting
with Al Rawi.

250
01:12:44,795 --> 01:12:47,423
Son of a bitch. He's on
his way there right now.

251
01:12:47,506 --> 01:12:48,715
All right, what do
you want me to do?

252
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:51,051
Follow Miller. He'll
lead you right to him.

253
01:12:51,093 --> 01:12:54,138
And when you find Al Rawi, you
take that son of a bitch out.

254
01:12:54,221 --> 01:12:55,556
What about Miller?

255
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:58,517
He's off reservation.
Miller can't bring in Al Rawi.

256
01:12:59,017 --> 01:13:00,435
Don't let him
get in the way.

257
01:13:00,519 --> 01:13:02,354
l want to make
that announcement.

258
01:13:02,396 --> 01:13:03,730
Now?
Just make it happen!

259
01:13:32,426 --> 01:13:35,179
This is Vanguard 6
on the airborne command.

260
01:13:35,345 --> 01:13:38,098
l need a C-2 bird
with eyes over Adhamiya.

261
01:13:38,182 --> 01:13:40,642
l want an ISO
on all military radio

262
01:13:40,726 --> 01:13:44,271
and cell phone transmissions
for a three-mile radius.

263
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:50,068
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.

264
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:52,154
Vanguard 6,
this is Alpha 1.

265
01:13:52,237 --> 01:13:56,408
Alpha 1, l need you to divert
to Adhamiya Central immediately.

266
01:13:56,450 --> 01:14:00,954
We have a high-value target
identified, Mohammed Al Rawi.

267
01:14:00,996 --> 01:14:03,582
This is a kill
no capture m' ission.

268
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:05,584
Roger that.

269
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,633
Here they are.

270
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:16,511
Yeah, l'll tell him.
We're on our way.

271
01:14:18,972 --> 01:14:21,391
Poundstone's iust called
a press briefing downstairs.

272
01:14:21,475 --> 01:14:23,477
lt's something big, Marty.

273
01:14:56,051 --> 01:14:59,221
This is the bus station.
It's just over there.

274
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:12,192
Stagger two teams.

275
01:15:12,234 --> 01:15:13,694
l'm going to move
across to the kiosk.

276
01:15:13,777 --> 01:15:17,155
You give me 30 seconds
to get across, then follow.

277
01:16:15,589 --> 01:16:18,592
Someone iust showed up.
l'm going to follow.

278
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:29,895
Two minutes, people. Two
minutes to the announcement.

279
01:17:04,137 --> 01:17:06,932
He's going out
the central alley, west.

280
01:17:15,941 --> 01:17:18,944
Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

281
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,948
We have a maior announcement.

282
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:24,866
This follows in lockstep
with our commitment

283
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,369
to eliminate the tyranny
of Saddam Hussein

284
01:17:27,452 --> 01:17:31,790
and expeditiously transform Iraq
into a modern, functioning democracy.

285
01:17:32,999 --> 01:17:34,918
Ambassador Bremer
has just signed an order

286
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:38,380
immediately disbanding Iraq's
remaining military forces.

287

Authority hereby dissolves

288

01:17:47,681 --> 01:17:49,057
ministries of defense,

290
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:53,687
information, military affairs,
intelligence and national security.

291
01:17:54,396 --> 01:17:56,898
All officers,
soldiers, conscripts

292
01:17:56,982 --> 01:18:00,193
and other military figures
are relieved of duty.

293
01:18:01,027 --> 01:18:04,906
All military ranks, titles
and status are canceled.

294
01:18:05,865 --> 01:18:10,620
ln addition, Iraq's ruling Ba'ath Party
is dissolved with immediate effect.

295
01:18:11,705 --> 01:18:15,875
Party members will be summarily fired
from central and local government offices,

296
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:20,296
hospiitals, universities, schools
and other public institutions.

297
01:18:20,797 --> 01:18:25,385
This is the dawn of new leadership
in Iraq, and let the world take note,

298
01:18:25,427 --> 01:18:28,388
change is coming to
the Middle East at last.

299
01:18:45,572 --> 01:18:47,615
Still moving southwest.
Southwest.

300
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,075
Copy that.

301
01:19:14,434 --> 01:19:15,477
You got him?

302
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,353
Yeah, l see him.

303
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:21,399
l lost contact.

304
01:19:23,443 --> 01:19:25,028
l lost contact.

305
01:19:39,334 --> 01:19:41,044
Fuck!
Get an angle!

306
01:19:41,127 --> 01:19:42,670
Fuck,
he's in the vehicle.

307
01:19:42,754 --> 01:19:44,130
God damn it!
Stay on Chief!

308
01:19:44,172 --> 01:19:45,173
Where the fuck did they go?

309
01:19:45,256 --> 01:19:46,299
Did he get in the vehicle?

310
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:48,718
Let's go! Let's go!
This is MET Team "D."

311
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:51,387
We need help.
American soldier kidnapped!

312
01:19:51,471 --> 01:19:52,805
We need help down here!

313
01:19:53,806 --> 01:19:56,517
All units, we need help
in the Adhamiya district.

314
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:59,604
Copy that, MET Team.
This is Vanguard 6 and TF221.

315
01:19:59,646 --> 01:20:01,606
What's your position
and status?

316
01:20:01,648 --> 01:20:05,151
Vanguard 6, we're five blocks
south of the Adhamiya bus station.

317
01:20:05,193 --> 01:20:07,237
Kidnappers heading
east in two small cars.

318
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,364
Roger that.
Met-D, l am en route.

319
01:20:09,447 --> 01:20:12,283
l need you to return to your vehicles
and await further instructions.

320
01:20:18,039 --> 01:20:20,250
Falcon 16,
this is Vanguard 6.

321
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:24,420
We have a US soldier abducted. We
need eyes on those vehicles now!

322
01:20:24,587 --> 01:20:26,965
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

323
01:20:27,006 --> 01:20:29,926
Currently two klicks
northeast of Adhamiya.

324
01:20:30,009 --> 01:20:33,304
Establishing an area of
perimeter and sweeping Adhamiya.

325
01:20:33,346 --> 01:20:35,848
AOR 87, Alpha Tango.

326
01:20:36,891 --> 01:20:39,185
We gotta
get him out of there.

327
01:20:39,477 --> 01:20:41,521
Get me Chief Miller now.

328
01:21:03,626 --> 01:21:07,213
They've taken him. God
damn it! They've taken him.

329
01:21:21,352 --> 01:21:23,479
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

330
01:21:23,563 --> 01:21:26,190
l've got your two
vehicles moving rapidly.

331
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:38,244
The two vehicles
just entered a garage.

332
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:40,538
There's a large water tower
on top of the building.

333
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:45,418
Grid Kilo-Zulu-8732-6428.

334
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:49,589
Alpha 1, l'm going in on foot.
Continue to target. Acknowledge.

335
01:21:52,675 --> 01:21:55,261
This is Alpha 1. We're three
klicks from target area.

336
01:21:55,344 --> 01:21:58,765
All right, put us down.
Find an LZ a klick from here.

337
01:23:32,984 --> 01:23:34,443
Who are you?

338
01:23:34,902 --> 01:23:37,238
General, my name's
Roy Miller.

339
01:23:37,321 --> 01:23:39,824
l'm a chief warrant
officer with the US Army.

340
01:23:40,866 --> 01:23:42,618
What do you want?

341
01:23:45,371 --> 01:23:47,331
l came here to bring you in.

342
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:03,055
General, l'm aware that you
had contact with a US official

343
01:24:03,097 --> 01:24:05,558
in the weeks
leading up to the war.

344
01:24:06,892 --> 01:24:10,396
l know you were ready to tell them
everything about Iraq's WMD programs.

345
01:24:10,438 --> 01:24:12,023
What programs?

346
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:15,192
There are no programs.

347
01:24:16,402 --> 01:24:18,237
l told your official.

348
01:24:18,738 --> 01:24:21,657
We dismantled
everything after '91.

349
01:24:23,034 --> 01:24:27,747
He told my government that you confirmed
that the programs were still active.

350
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:33,878
He lied about what you said.
That's why we're here.

351
01:24:44,096 --> 01:24:47,183
Did anyone verify
his story?

352
01:24:48,434 --> 01:24:49,518
No.

353
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:55,649
Your government wanted
to hear the lie, Mr. Miller.

354
01:24:57,318 --> 01:25:02,907
They wanted Saddam out, and they
did exactly what they had to do.

355
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:05,910
This is why you are here.

356
01:25:16,629 --> 01:25:17,713
Go.

357
01:25:28,516 --> 01:25:31,310
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard
6. Give me your location.

358
01:25:31,393 --> 01:25:32,978
Vanguard 6,
this is Alpha 1.

359
01:25:33,062 --> 01:25:34,980
We're half a klick away.
Split up.

360
01:25:35,022 --> 01:25:36,357
Alpha team,
take the west side,

361
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,983
Bravo team, take the east
side of the objective.

362
01:25:38,067 --> 01:25:41,987
l got north-south. Move to
assault positions. Wait for my go.

363
01:25:42,071 --> 01:25:43,489
Roger that.

364
01:25:50,204 --> 01:25:53,457
So, do you have
a message for me?

365
01:25:57,711 --> 01:26:00,172
General, if you
come in with me,

366
01:26:01,549 --> 01:26:04,885
there are still people in
Washington who will work with you.

367
01:26:06,095 --> 01:26:09,682
People who understand that
we still need the Iraqi army

368
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:11,267
to hold this place together.

369
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:14,478
Then why is your government
disbanding the Army?

370
01:26:15,187 --> 01:26:16,981
Making us outlaws.

371
01:26:18,065 --> 01:26:21,610
Why take Iraq apart
piece by piece?

372
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:24,238
Why?

373
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:31,120
l risked my life

374
01:26:32,371 --> 01:26:34,873
to tell you the truth
about WMD.

375
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:40,337
"Tell the truth and you'll have a
place in the new Iraq," they said.

376
01:26:41,588 --> 01:26:44,591
So where is my place,
Mr. Miller?

377
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:48,679
On a deck of cards?

378
01:27:35,768 --> 01:27:38,270
Why are you
really here, Miller?

379
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:41,899
You were supposed
to lead me into a trap.

380
01:27:43,609 --> 01:27:47,738
You will tell me now how
they are planning to take me.

381
01:27:49,907 --> 01:27:51,533
Everybody in position?

382
01:27:51,617 --> 01:27:53,786
Vanguard Bravo in position.

383
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:58,582
Vanguard 6, this is
Bravo 1. We're ready.

384
01:28:03,128 --> 01:28:06,548
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha
1. We're in position.

385
01:28:12,262 --> 01:28:14,681
You have to come
in with me, General.

386
01:28:14,765 --> 01:28:17,810
You will get nothing
if you fight us.

387
01:28:20,604 --> 01:28:23,565
You have to come in now
before it's too late.

388
01:28:23,649 --> 01:28:26,693
You think the war is over

389
01:28:27,986 --> 01:28:30,614
iust because
you are in Baghdad?

390
01:28:31,907 --> 01:28:33,492
You will see.

391
01:28:34,076 --> 01:28:36,078
lt has only just begun.

392
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,913
Let's go.

393
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:55,430
Grenade!

394
01:28:55,514 --> 01:28:56,849
Go! Go!

395
01:29:55,574 --> 01:29:57,576
Come on! Move!

396
01:30:09,296 --> 01:30:12,049
Let's go. Let's go.

397
01:30:13,091 --> 01:30:15,594
Man down!
Hit the rooftop!

398
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:16,887
Go!

399
01:30:41,328 --> 01:30:43,663
Clear! Stack on Dutch!

400
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:48,210
Go!

401
01:30:57,427 --> 01:31:00,472
"B" Team, go left. Last
guy with me. Let's go!

402
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:14,277
l've got something.

403
01:31:14,778 --> 01:31:17,614
Sir, l've got two hostiles
headed east.

404
01:31:22,661 --> 01:31:26,039
Sir, l got one more. There's
one friendly in pursuit.

405
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:31,753
Hold!

406
01:31:31,837 --> 01:31:34,464
Vanguard 6,
this is falcon 16.

407
01:31:34,506 --> 01:31:37,050
Two hostiles and one friendly
have exited target site

408
01:31:37,133 --> 01:31:41,179
and are now moving through
alley northeast of your location.

409
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:43,056
Keep the area clear.

410
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:45,350
l'm activating
my transponder.

411
01:31:46,685 --> 01:31:49,229
Bring me in.
l want to cut them off.

412
01:32:12,919 --> 01:32:15,463
Down, get down!
Get the fuck down!

413
01:32:38,737 --> 01:32:40,864
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

414
01:32:40,905 --> 01:32:44,576
The targets have lost the friendly.
Targets are now moving north.

415
01:32:44,618 --> 01:32:48,413
Turn 45 degrees to your left,
maintain intercepting course.

416
01:32:48,455 --> 01:32:49,873
Turn! Turn!

417
01:33:23,114 --> 01:33:25,200
l've lost
visual contact.

418
01:33:55,271 --> 01:33:56,773
l've got them!

419
01:34:09,035 --> 01:34:11,371
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

420
01:34:11,454 --> 01:34:13,164
Keep going
your current direction.

421
01:34:13,206 --> 01:34:16,543
The target is crossing
open ground, headed north.

422
01:34:19,671 --> 01:34:21,422
RPG!
Shit!

423
01:37:06,838 --> 01:37:08,339
Walk over.

424
01:37:17,348 --> 01:37:18,683
Stop there.

425
01:37:24,188 --> 01:37:27,525
You sure this is what they
want back in Washington?

426
01:37:40,913 --> 01:37:42,790
Put that weapon down!

427
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:46,210
Now, Freddy!

428
01:37:53,384 --> 01:37:55,469
What the fuck did you do?

429
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,978
lt is not for you to
decide what happens here.

430
01:38:27,793 --> 01:38:30,379
Get out of here,
Freddy. Go home.

431
01:38:31,631 --> 01:38:33,090
We're gonna be
locking this area down.

432
01:38:33,132 --> 01:38:34,258
There are gonna be
soldiers everywhere.

433
01:38:34,342 --> 01:38:35,760
Go home now,

434
01:38:36,052 --> 01:38:37,553
while you can.

435
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:14,900
Do you think you can form a successful
government without Sunni involvement?

436
01:40:14,984 --> 01:40:17,528
This is
a new beginning for Iraq.

437
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:21,449
This is the end of tyranny
and the beginning of freedom.

438
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:24,952
How long will
US forces be in Iraq?

439
01:40:25,035 --> 01:40:27,288
As long as they are needed.

440
01:40:27,788 --> 01:40:29,665
Thank you. That's it.

441
01:40:31,584 --> 01:40:33,419
Clark.
Mr. Zubaidi.

442
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:34,712
lt's a great day.

443
01:40:34,753 --> 01:40:36,547
lndeed, indeed.
Good to see you.

444
01:40:36,589 --> 01:40:38,382
Welcome. Welcome.

445
01:40:55,399 --> 01:40:58,819
How are you, gentlemen?
How are you? Good, good.

446
01:40:58,903 --> 01:41:01,780
So, does this mean there's
going to be an election soon?

447
01:41:11,373 --> 01:41:13,751
There's been
a democracy deficit.

448
01:41:17,129 --> 01:41:20,799
Can you comment about the
action last night in Adhamiya?

449
01:41:23,427 --> 01:41:24,470
Chief Miller.

450
01:41:24,553 --> 01:41:29,016
lt's a copy of my intel report. l
wanted to give it to you personally.

451
01:41:29,266 --> 01:41:30,434
Thank you.
Is this Al Rawi?

452
01:41:30,476 --> 01:41:31,727
Yeah.

453
01:41:31,769 --> 01:41:33,812
Yeah, l heard about this.

454
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:45,950
There's some pretty
strong language here.

455
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:48,702
But what's the point, Miller?

456
01:41:48,786 --> 01:41:51,121
Do you think anybody's
going to listen to you?

457
01:41:51,163 --> 01:41:53,040
l know what you did.

458
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,418
What did you say?

459
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,545
You made him up
to get what you needed.

460
01:41:58,629 --> 01:42:00,798
Magellan.
You made him up.

461
01:42:01,799 --> 01:42:04,885
l don't know what
you're talking about, Miller.

462
01:42:05,928 --> 01:42:08,138
When you peddled that shit in
DC, did they know it was a lie?

463
01:42:08,222 --> 01:42:09,556
Or did they iust
never bother to ask?

464
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:10,849
Okay, okay.

465
01:42:10,933 --> 01:42:13,936
Come on, none of this matters
anymore. WMD? This doesn't matter.

466
01:42:13,978 --> 01:42:16,313
What the fuck are you talking
about? Of course, it fucking matters.

467
01:42:16,355 --> 01:42:18,482
The reasons we go to war always matter!

468
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:21,527
lt's all that fucking
matters. It fucking matters.

469
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:23,320
At ease, soldier.

470
01:42:25,864 --> 01:42:28,242
Do you have any idea
what you've done here?

471
01:42:28,325 --> 01:42:30,911
What's going to happen next
time we need people to trust us?

472
01:42:30,994 --> 01:42:32,037
Clark!

473
01:42:32,121 --> 01:42:33,789
We're not turning
back, Miller.

474
01:42:34,039 --> 01:42:35,082
We won.

475
01:42:35,165 --> 01:42:36,208
Clark!

476
01:42:36,291 --> 01:42:38,961
Son of a bitch. What?

477
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
