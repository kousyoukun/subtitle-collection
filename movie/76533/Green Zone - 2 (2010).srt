1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:04,989
Your friend from the Pentagon
Special Intelligence Unit came to see me.

2
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:06,052
Poundstone?

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,358
Yeah, Poundstone.

4
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:10,993
Poundstone's unit pushed all that WMD
intel you've been chasing your tail on.

5
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:12,730
What? You mean Magellan?

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,499
Who is Magellan?
Have you ever met him?

7
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:15,664
No.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,503
Poundstone's got him
locked up tight.

9
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,510
That's why we gotta find out
what's going on.

10
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:21,838
Here's the deal.

11
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:23,039
We checked the notebook.

12
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:25,708
It's a list of addresses around Baghdad,
mostly Adhamiya.

13
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:28,775
It's a Sunni stronghold,
very sympathetic to the army.

14
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:30,912
More than likely,
that's where Al Rawi is.

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,389
The notebook's probably his line
to his battalion commanders.

16
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,482
We all set?

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,356
Not yet. We're waiting
on military support.

18
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:39,863
Push them hard. I want to
get every address in that book.

19
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:41,489
So, what do you think
that meeting was about?

20
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:44,034
What would you be talking about
if you just got invaded?

21
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:46,297
You think Al Rawi
wants to fight?

22
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,635
If we don't make him
an offer, he will.

23
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:50,697
What? You're going
to cut a deal?

24
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,938
You're going to cut a deal
with the Jack of Clubs?

25
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,274
What do you think
you're doing here, Miller?

26
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,282
You're off reservation
for a reason. What is it?

27
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,319
Well, I came to find weapons
and save lives.

28
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:04,184
And I didn't find shit.

29
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:05,882
I want to know why.

30
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:08,926
There are no easy answers. If you
want that, go work with Poundstone.

31
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:10,984
All we got is hard choices.

32
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:12,654
You want to know what
happened to the weapons?

33
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:14,998
We gotta find Al Rawi
and bring him in.

34
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,727
He'll give us
the truth about WMD

35
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,931
and give us a shot at standing this
country up without a bloodbath.

36
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:23,800
Do you want the job or not?

37
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:28,802
Yeah, I want it.
Good.

38
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:33,012
Hamza's being held at the high-value
target wing at Camp Cropper.

39
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:35,018
Poundstone's unit
have him under wraps.

40
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,520
So, how are you going
to get to him?

41
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:39,283
I'm not. You are.

42
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:41,355
Here's a pass.

43
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:45,226
We've got another prisoner there
we can use to get you in.

44
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:48,356
Low-level Republican Guard,
way below their radar.

45
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:51,300
Use him as an excuse
to get to Hamza.

46
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,234
Here's a million
dollars in cash.

47
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:55,932
Tell Hamza the money's his
if he gives us what we need.

48
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:58,940
You tell him if
he gives Al Rawi to me,

49
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,604
keeps his mouth shut
over there until I bring him in,

50
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:05,445
I'll have him and his family out of
the country by the end of the week.

51
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:08,508
You want me to tell him to not
talk to the American interrogators?

52
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,110
That's right.

53
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:15,352
I thought we were
all on the same side.

54
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,018
Don't be naive.

55
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:42,780
Miller.

56
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:45,251
Pentagon just
revoked your transfer.

57
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:49,282
You're being released back to your unit,
effective immediately.

58
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,620
You chose the wrong side.

59
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:02,268
Follow me, Freddy.
We gotta move fast.

60
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,800
Where do you think you're going?

61
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:07,936
Let us through.
Step aside, please.

62
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:14,045
What the hell are you playing at?
Get me Langley.

63
00:03:14,118 --> 00:03:16,052
You are required
to hand over all information.

64
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,146
White House authorization.
I want the book.

65
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:32,429
DC's got too much riding on this to have you
and some Ba'athist generals fuck it up.

66
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:34,700
Martin.

67
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:36,735
Langley confirms.

68
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:40,042
I've got it!

69
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:47,050
Let's go.
Stay out of this, Marty.

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,747
You all right here?
Yeah.

71
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02,994
Use local assets.

72
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:05,732
It's high priority.

73
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,573
Stay close to me, Freddy.

74
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,345
Put him down.

75
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:02,352
OGA.

76
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,587
I'm here to see a prisoner.

77
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,026
Heads up, Sarge.
Hey, Sergeant.

78
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,297
Hello, sir.

79
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,972
I'm here to see
Abdullah Ferat.

80
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,470
I'm gonna have
to search your bag.

81
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:21,842
What's up with Hajji?

82
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,676
He's my translator.

83
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,885
Arms up, legs apart.

84
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:42,459
Check it out.

85
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,330
What's that in your pocket?

86
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,165
It's my cigarettes.

87
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:49,502
Good to go.
Here you go, sir.

88
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:52,168
Go ahead and take
them back to IR-1.

89
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,359
Right here.

90
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,709
That's not necessary, Sergeant.

91
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,717
Standard procedure, sir.

92
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:44,117
Sergeant, I have to have a classified
conversation with the prisoner.

93
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,389
You can go on
and step outside.

94
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:47,863
Roger, sir.
Be right outside.

95
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:14,118
Do you know why
they brought him here?

96
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:20,230
He's here because he's in
the Republican Guard, Freddy.

97
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:22,123
Hey, Sergeant.

98
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,501
Hey, listen, this guy just gave us
a piece of intel.

99
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,164
You apparently have a prisoner in your
HVT wing here named Seyyed Hamza.

100
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,332
He can ID him for me.

101
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,501
I gotta get him down here
and ID him real quick.

102
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:35,170
You're going to need
an EJ-75 for that, man.

103
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,304
Guys, I got a live op going.

104
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,814
I got a team in place ready to move on
a target. I gotta do this now.

105
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:39,872
How long will it take?

106
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,974
2 minutes.

107
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,111
Just 2 minutes?
That's it. 2 minutes. Come on.

108
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,155
All right. Good, let's go.
Hey, Freddy.

109
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,123
Put those bags
on their heads.

110
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,873
OGA coming in
for an ID check.

111
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,155
Hey, Hamza.

112
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,587
Get up.

113
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:27,091
Shit.

114
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,967
Get a medic!

115
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,699
I said, get a medic!

116
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:40,007
Hey, get the medics on the phone.
We've got a situation here.

117
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:44,142
He say, "Why did you
do this to me?"

118
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:50,786
He say the general did everything
you ask of him in the meeting.

119
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:53,750
What do you...
What meeting?

120
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:56,383
What meeting?

121
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,931
He just say Jordan.

122
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:06,425
Clear the way!
Clear the way!

123
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,528
What is going on here, Miller?

124
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,596
Coming through! Okay.

125
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,105
What does he mean, "Jordan"?

126
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,714
We gotta stop the bleeding.
His pulse is weak.

127
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,980
I need to talk to you
about Magellan.

128
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:43,190
I'm going to call you
right back.

129
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:45,695
What you got?

130
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,456
I read your articles.

131
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:52,502
You said an Iraqi WMD source
named Magellan

132
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,164
met with US officials
prior to the war.

133
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,968
I need to know
about that meeting.

134
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,306
No. Come on, Miller.
I can't discuss my sources with you.

135
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:04,279
Well, did you ever meet the guy?
Do you know who he is?

136
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,943
Of course I didn't meet him.
He's an Iraqi internal, for Christ's sake.

137
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,078
Then how do you know
what he's saying is true?

138
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,120
Because I made contact through
a reliable intermediary.

139
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,751
Reliable?
Yes.

140
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,962
Have you ever even been to
any of Magellan's sites?

141
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,002
You ever been
to Diwaniya? Tikrit?

142
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,699
No.

143
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:30,899
There's nothing there.

144
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,443
Magellan's intel
is bullshit.

145
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,508
Who's the intermediary?

146
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,483
No. I'm not discussing
sources, Miller.

147
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,612
Jesus Christ!
This is the reason we went to war!

148
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,958
All right, then at least tell me
how it happened.

149
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,089
How does this happen?

150
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:58,464
How does somebody like you
write something that's not true?

151
00:12:58,535 --> 00:12:59,832
Tell me!

152
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:03,634
What do you know?

153
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:15,779
Look, I got a phone call one day
from a senior official in DC.

154
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,882
He says,
"I've got a story for you.

155
00:13:18,956 --> 00:13:21,652
"The truth about
Saddam's WMD programs."

156
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,756
So I go to meet him.

157
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,325
He puts the source
report in my hands.

158
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,466
Magellan's product,
the raw intel.

159
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:33,800
But when do you
check the story?

160
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,970
He was a senior official,
for Christ's sake.

161
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:41,637
He had access
to Magellan's debrief.

162
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:45,842
All he asked was that I not disclose
the location of the meeting.

163
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:48,175
The location.

164
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:50,618
Yes, in case I'd
compromise the source.

165
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:54,449
It was Jordan, wasn't it?

166
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:57,919
The meeting was in Jordan.

167
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,627
Yes.

168
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,615
You can keep
your million dollars.

169
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,881
Al Rawi's Magellan.

170
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,715
They're debriefing Magellan.
They've got him held tight.

171
00:14:27,124 --> 00:14:29,024
Supposing they don't?

172
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,527
John, take care of the money.

173
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:38,159
Hamza said Al Rawi
met US officials in Jordan.

174
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:39,964
Now Dayne said
the same thing about Magellan.

175
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,033
That's more
than a coincidence.

176
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:44,768
Maybe. It doesn't
make any sense.

177
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,570
If Poundstone met Al Rawi in Jordan,
what's he hiding?

178
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:51,239
Well, what if he told him something
he didn't wanna hear?

179
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:53,977
What if he told him
there were no WMD?

180
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,547
I want Al Rawi's
movements outside Iraq.

181
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,888
January, February, 2003.
Anything you got.

182
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,393
I'm on it.

183
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:07,930
It all makes sense.
The bad intel.

184
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:10,364
Why our teams came up
empty at those sites.

185
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:13,665
Maybe we're looking at this thing
the wrong way around.

186
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:15,295
It's a theory.

187
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:17,799
You've got no proof.

188
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,274
Don't be naive.

189
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:26,442
Sir, Mohammed Al Rawi was in Amman,
Jordan on February 5th, 2003.

190
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:31,477
That's 3 days before
Magellan came online.

191
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:35,882
Give me Clark Poundstone's
movements, same period.

192
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:43,293
Sir, we've got a DOD
Gulfstream on the same date.

193
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:47,133
Passenger Clark Poundstone routed
Washington, DC to Amman, Jordan.

194
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:51,231
Martin, we're getting reports of
an attack on an Al Rawi safe house.

195
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:52,866
South Adhamiya.

196
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,441
Poundstone's hunting Al Rawi.
He doesn't want the truth to get out.

197
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:58,913
I need to know where the next
safe house is.

198
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,489
All clear, Chief.

199
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:21,453
Send Freddy!

200
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:24,523
Yes, sir!
Freddy, on the move.

201
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,739
Freddy, I need you
to translate.

202
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:34,276
Tell him I need to get a message
to General Al Rawi.

203
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,605
Tell him I need
to meet Al Rawi tonight.

204
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:46,948
Chief Miller on the
phone for you, sir.

205
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,721
Yeah?
I got him.

206
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:53,456
Tahir al-Malik, one of Al Rawi's
battalion commanders.

207
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,498
Where is he?
I let him go.

208
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:58,056
Look, I told him to get
a message to Al Rawi.

209
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:01,866
I told him I'd meet him
at the Adhamiya bus station tonight.

210
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:04,430
If I can bring him in alive,
then we'll have our proof.

211
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:07,636
<i>If he talks, then we'll get
the truth about WMD.</i>

212
00:18:08,345 --> 00:18:11,610
All right, if you get in front of Al Rawi,
offer him whatever you have to.

213
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:12,706
<i>If you pull this off,</i>

214
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:14,842
<i>there's still a chance we can
hold this place together.</i>

215
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,715
I'm headed there now.

216
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:20,582
You are serious to do a deal
with Mohammed Al Rawi?

217
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:23,558
You know what already
he do to this country?

218
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,920
We're just trying
to save lives, Freddy.

219
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:31,399
There are people who think
he can stop an insurgency.

220
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:34,066
All right, listen up,
we're going to Adhamiya.

221
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,833
But look, we're going alone,
so weapons check, comms check.

222
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,898
Make sure you're 100%.
We got no support.

223
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:40,466
Hooah?
Hooah!

224
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:41,977
You okay?
Sergeant P, can I get a radio check?

225
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,706
Go to 1.
Miller, what you are doing?

226
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,179
Channel 1.
Roger that.

227
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:47,239
Look at what's happening.

228
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,586
I just need you to do
your job tonight, Freddy.

229
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:02,496
Let's roll!

230
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:27,343
Thank you all very much.
Admiral Kelly, Captain Card,

231
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:31,183
officers and sailors
of the USS Abraham Lincoln,

232
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:33,718
my fellow Americans.

233
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:37,359
Major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

234
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,792
In the battle of Iraq,

235
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,458
the United States and
our allies have prevailed.

236
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,467
All right!

237
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:59,105
Yeah?
This is Briggs.

238
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,041
We got a problem.

239
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:03,047
My local assets are down.

240
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,886
I got a report saying it was US Army
took them out and nobody called it in.

241
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,423
Where's Miller?

242
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,051
Stand by.

243
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:14,160
All right, listen up. I need
everybody on a Blue Force Tracker.

244
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,165
Met-Delta 85th, XTF.

245
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:27,568
Sir.

246
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,752
He's moving northwest
towards Adhamiya.

247
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:40,050
ETA?
12 minutes, sir.

248
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:41,590
<i>ETA, 12 minutes.</i>

249
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,521
He's meeting with Al Rawi.

250
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,223
Son of a bitch.
He's on his way there right now.

251
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:49,526
All right, what do
you want me to do?

252
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,829
Follow Miller.
He'll lead you right to him.

253
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:54,928
And when you find Al Rawi,
you take that son of a bitch out.

254
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:56,370
What about Miller?

255
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:59,306
He's off reservation.
Miller can't bring in Al Rawi.

256
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:01,242
Don't let him
get in the way.

257
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,142
I want to make
that announcement.

258
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:04,544
Now?
Just make it happen!

259
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:35,973
This is Vanguard 6
on the airborne command.

260
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,910
I need a C-2 bird
with eyes over Adhamiya.

261
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,450
I want an ISO
on all military radio

262
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:45,045
and cell phone transmissions
for a 3-mile radius.

263
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:50,855
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.

264
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,958
Vanguard 6,
this is Alpha 1.

265
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:57,193
Alpha 1, I need you to divert
to Adhamiya Central immediately.

266
00:22:57,267 --> 00:23:01,727
We have a high-value target identified,
Mohammed Al Rawi.

267
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:04,365
This is a kill,
no capture mission.

268
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,373
Roger that.

269
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:13,440
Here they are.

270
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,312
Yeah, I'll tell him.
We're on our way.

271
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,190
Poundstone's just called
a press briefing downstairs.

272
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:24,284
It's something big, Marty.

273
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,023
This is the bus station.
It's just over there.

274
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:12,964
Stagger 2 teams.

275
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,510
I'm going to move
across to the kiosk.

276
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:17,944
You give me 30 seconds
to get across, then follow.

277
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:19,375
Someone just showed up.
I'm going to follow.

278
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,684
2 minutes, people.
2 minutes to the announcement.

279
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:07,719
He's going out
the central alley, west.

280
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:19,725
Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

281
00:26:21,638 --> 00:26:23,731
We have a major announcement.

282
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:25,672
This follows in lockstep
with our commitment

283
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:28,176
to eliminate the tyranny
of Saddam Hussein

284
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:32,578
and expeditiously transform Iraq into
a modern, functioning democracy.

285
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:35,717
Ambassador Bremer
has just signed an order

286
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:39,186
immediately disbanding Iraq's
remaining military forces.

287
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:43,752
The Coalition Provisional
Authority hereby dissolves

288
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:47,490
the entirety of Iraq's military
and paramilitary forces,

289
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:49,863
ministries of defense,

290
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:54,495
information, military affairs,
intelligence and national security.

291
00:26:55,205 --> 00:26:57,696
All officers,
soldiers, conscripts

292
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:00,971
and other military figures
are relieved of duty.

293
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:05,713
All military ranks, titles
and status are canceled.

294
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:11,416
In addition, Iraq's ruling Ba'ath Party
is dissolved with immediate effect.

295
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:16,653
Party members will be summarily fired from
central and local government offices,

296
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:21,095
hospitals, universities, schools
and other public institutions.

297
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,160
This is the dawn of new leadership in Iraq,
and let the world take note,

298
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:29,171
change is coming to
the Middle East at last.

299
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:48,414
Still moving southwest.
Southwest.

300
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:49,890
Copy that.

301
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:16,276
You got him?

302
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:18,149
Yeah, I see him.

303
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,185
I lost contact.

304
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,818
I lost contact.

305
00:28:40,143 --> 00:28:41,838
Fuck!
Get an angle!

306
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:43,469
Fuck, he's in the vehicle.

307
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:44,911
God damn it!
Stay on Chief!

308
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:45,970
Where the fuck did they go?

309
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,073
Did he get in the vehicle?

310
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,516
Let's go! Let's go!
This is MET Team "D."

311
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:52,180
We need help.
American soldier kidnapped!

312
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:53,586
We need help down here!

313
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:57,320
All units, we need help
in the Adhamiya district.

314
00:28:57,393 --> 00:29:00,385
Copy that, MET Team.
This is Vanguard 6 and TF221.

315
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:02,397
What's your position
and status?

316
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:05,923
Vanguard 6, we're 5 blocks south
of the Adhamiya bus station.

317
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:08,027
Kidnappers heading
east in 2 small cars.

318
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:10,163
Roger that.
Met-D, I am en route.

319
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:13,072
I need you to return to your vehicles
and await further instructions.

320
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:21,043
Falcon 16,
this is Vanguard 6.

321
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:25,213
We have a US soldier abducted.
We need eyes on those vehicles now!

322
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,754
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

323
00:29:27,824 --> 00:29:30,725
Currently 2 klicks
northeast of Adhamiya.

324
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:34,092
Establishing an area of perimeter
and sweeping Adhamiya.

325
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:36,654
AOR 87, Alpha Tango.

326
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,998
We gotta get him out of there.

327
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,328
Get me Chief Miller now.

328
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:08,022
They've taken him.
God damn it! They've taken him.

329
00:30:22,145 --> 00:30:24,272
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

330
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:26,975
I've got your 2 vehicles
moving rapidly.

331
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,057
The 2 vehicles
just entered a garage.

332
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,323
There's a large water tower
on top of the building.

333
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:46,198
Grid Kilo-Zulu-8732-6428.

334
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:50,365
Alpha 1, I'm going in on foot.
Continue to target. Acknowledge.

335
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,070
This is Alpha 1.
We're 3 klicks from target area.

336
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,581
All right, put us down.
Find an LZ a klick from here.

337
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:35,243
Who are you?

338
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:38,043
General, my name's
Roy Miller.

339
00:32:38,114 --> 00:32:40,605
I'm a chief warrant
officer with the US Army.

340
00:32:41,684 --> 00:32:43,413
What do you want?

341
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:48,123
I came here to bring you in.

342
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,838
General, I'm aware that you had
contact with a US official

343
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:06,340
in the weeks
leading up to the war.

344
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,168
I know you were ready to tell them
everything about Iraq's WMD programs.

345
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:12,805
What programs?

346
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,975
There are no programs.

347
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:19,017
I told your official.

348
00:33:19,522 --> 00:33:22,457
We dismantled
everything after '91.

349
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:28,525
He told my government that you confirmed
that the programs were still active.

350
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:34,667
He lied about what you said.
That's why we're here.

351
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:47,974
Did anyone verify
his story?

352
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:50,310
No.

353
00:33:53,055 --> 00:33:56,456
Your government wanted
to hear the lie, Mr. Miller.

354
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:03,690
They wanted Saddam out, and they
did exactly what they had to do.

355
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,692
This is why you are here.

356
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:18,504
Go.

357
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:32,123
Alpha 1, this is Vanguard 6.
Give me your location.

358
00:34:32,194 --> 00:34:33,786
Vanguard 6,
this is Alpha 1.

359
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,763
We're half a klick away.
Split up.

360
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:37,162
Alpha team,
take the west side,

361
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:38,791
Bravo team, take the east side
of the objective.

362
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,804
I got north-south. Move to
assault positions. Wait for my go.

363
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,305
Roger that.

364
00:34:51,013 --> 00:34:54,244
So, do you have
a message for me?

365
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:00,989
General, if you
come in with me,

366
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:05,691
there are still people in Washington
who will work with you.

367
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:10,491
People who understand
that we still need the Iraqi army

368
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,056
to hold this place together.

369
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:15,262
Then why is your government
disbanding the Army?

370
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:17,769
Making us outlaws.

371
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:22,401
Why take Iraq apart
piece by piece?

372
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,039
Why?

373
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:31,918
I risked my life

374
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:35,680
to tell you the truth
about WMD.

375
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:41,126
"Tell the truth and you'll have a place
in the new Iraq," they said.

376
00:35:42,398 --> 00:35:45,390
So where is my place,
Mr. Miller?

377
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,468
On a deck of cards?

378
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:39,053
Why are you
really here, Miller?

379
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:42,690
You were supposed
to lead me into a trap.

380
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:48,523
You will tell me now how
they are planning to take me.

381
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:52,326
Everybody in position?

382
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:54,596
Vanguard Bravo in position.

383
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:59,364
Vanguard 6, this is Bravo 1.
We're ready.

384
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:07,347
Vanguard 6, this is Alpha 1.
We're in position.

385
00:37:13,055 --> 00:37:15,489
You have to come
in with me, General.

386
00:37:15,558 --> 00:37:18,584
You will get nothing
if you fight us.

387
00:37:21,397 --> 00:37:24,366
You have to come in now
before it's too late.

388
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:27,493
You think the war is over

389
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:31,398
just because you are in Baghdad?

390
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,300
You will see.

391
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,868
It has only just begun.

392
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:38,710
Let's go.

393
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:56,226
Grenade!

394
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:57,629
Go! Go!

395
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:58,360
Come on! Move!

396
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:12,835
Let's go. Let's go.

397
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:16,401
Man down!
Hit the rooftop!

398
00:39:16,478 --> 00:39:17,672
Go!

399
00:39:42,137 --> 00:39:44,469
Clear! Stack on Dutch!

400
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,003
Go!

401
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,280
"B" Team, go left.
Last guy with me. Let's go!

402
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:15,061
I've got something.

403
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:18,404
Sir, I've got 2 hostiles
headed east.

404
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:26,846
Sir, I got one more.
There's one friendly in pursuit.

405
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,544
Hold!

406
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:35,249
Vanguard 6, this is Falcon 16.

407
00:40:35,324 --> 00:40:37,849
2 hostiles and one friendly
have exited target site

408
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:41,987
and are now moving through alley
northeast of your location.

409
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,861
Keep the area clear.

410
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:46,162
I'm activating
my transponder.

411
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:50,028
Bring me in.
I want to cut them off.

412
00:41:13,729 --> 00:41:16,254
Down, get down!
Get the fuck down!

413
00:41:39,555 --> 00:41:41,648
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

414
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:45,353
The targets have lost the friendly.
Targets are now moving north.

415
00:41:45,427 --> 00:41:49,193
Turn 45 degrees to your left,
maintain intercepting course.

416
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:50,663
Turn! Turn!

417
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:25,991
I've lost visual contact.

418
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:57,554
I've got them!

419
00:43:09,845 --> 00:43:12,177
Vanguard 6,
this is Falcon 16.

420
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:13,942
Keep going
your current direction.

421
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:17,349
The target is crossing
open ground, headed north.

422
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:22,219
RPG!
Shit!

423
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:09,123
Walk over.

424
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:19,498
Stop there.

425
00:46:24,973 --> 00:46:28,340
You sure this is what they want
back in Washington?

426
00:46:41,723 --> 00:46:43,588
Put that weapon down!

427
00:46:45,327 --> 00:46:46,988
Now, Freddy!

428
00:46:54,169 --> 00:46:56,262
What the fuck did you do?

429
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,777
It is not for you to decide
what happens here.

430
00:47:28,603 --> 00:47:31,163
Get out of here,
Freddy. Go home.

431
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:33,874
We're gonna be
locking this area down.

432
00:47:33,942 --> 00:47:35,068
There are gonna be
soldiers everywhere.

433
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,542
Go home now,

434
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:38,335
while you can.

435
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,699
Do you think you can form a successful
government without Sunni involvement?

436
00:49:15,777 --> 00:49:18,337
This is a new beginning for Iraq.

437
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:22,247
This is the end of tyranny and the
beginning of freedom.

438
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:25,746
How long will
US forces be in Iraq?

439
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:28,085
As long as they are needed.

440
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,455
Thank you. That's it.

441
00:49:32,394 --> 00:49:34,225
Clark.
Mr. Zubaidi.

442
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:35,486
It's a great day.

443
00:49:35,564 --> 00:49:37,327
Indeed, indeed.
Good to see you.

444
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:39,196
Welcome. Welcome.

445
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:59,619
How are you, gentlemen?
How are you? Good, good.

446
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:02,589
So, does this mean there's
going to be an election soon?

447
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:14,567
There's been
a democracy deficit.

448
00:50:17,939 --> 00:50:21,602
Can you comment about the action
last night in Adhamiya?

449
00:50:24,212 --> 00:50:25,270
Chief Miller.

450
00:50:25,347 --> 00:50:29,807
It's a copy of my intel report.
I wanted to give it to you personally.

451
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:31,211
Thank you.
Is this Al Rawi?

452
00:50:31,286 --> 00:50:32,514
Yeah.

453
00:50:32,587 --> 00:50:34,612
Yeah, I heard about this.

454
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:46,733
There's some pretty
strong language here.

455
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,493
But what's the point, Miller?

456
00:50:49,571 --> 00:50:51,903
Do you think anybody's
going to listen to you?

457
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:53,838
I know what you did.

458
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,209
What did you say?

459
00:50:57,279 --> 00:50:59,338
You made him up
to get what you needed.

460
00:50:59,414 --> 00:51:01,575
Magellan.
You made him up.

461
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:05,678
I don't know what
you're talking about, Miller.

462
00:51:06,721 --> 00:51:08,951
When you peddled that shit in DC,
did they know it was a lie?

463
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,355
Or did they just
never bother to ask?

464
00:51:10,425 --> 00:51:11,653
Okay, okay.

465
00:51:11,726 --> 00:51:14,718
Come on, none of this matters anymore.
WMD? This doesn't matter.

466
00:51:14,796 --> 00:51:17,094
What the fuck are you talking about?
Of course, it fucking matters.

467
00:51:17,165 --> 00:51:19,292
The reasons we go to war
always matter!

468
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,336
It's all that fucking matters.
It fucking matters.

469
00:51:22,404 --> 00:51:24,099
At ease, soldier.

470
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:29,041
Do you have any idea
