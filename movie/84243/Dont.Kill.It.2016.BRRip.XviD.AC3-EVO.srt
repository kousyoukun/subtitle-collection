1
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,034
Get him, boy.

2
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,840
Titus!

3
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,679
Come here, boy.

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,636
Hey.

5
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,234
Titus!

6
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,914
Titus.

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,756
There you are, boy.

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,393
What the hell's the matter with you?

9
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,199
Nicely done, Titus.

10
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,829
Looks like I got me
a treasure-sniffing dog.

11
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,597
Titus. Titus. Titus. No!

12
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,993
No, no, no!

13
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,879
Titus, no!

14
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,439
No!

15
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,518
No! No.

16
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,913
No.

17
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,713
Your father's home early.

18
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,389
Hey there, how'd it go?

19
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,430
Thanks for reading to me.
I need reading glasses...

20
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,034
- ...one day.
- No problem.

21
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,195
He sure will like this.

22
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,833
Gabriel?

23
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,717
Are you all right? What's the matter?

24
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,594
Baby? Baby?

25
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,917
Gabriel, you son of a bitch.

26
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,870
Daddy?

27
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,230
You look so pretty,
I wanna tore all these off.

28
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,909
- Stop.
- Come on, Amber.

29
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,912
Wanna play something sexy and dance?

30
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,198
No, I don't. Don't touch me.

31
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,199
Come on now.

32
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,760
Just one dance, huh?

33
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,152
- Come on, like old times, you know.
- Frank, stop.

34
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,676
Amber, why are you teasing me
like this, then?

35
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,031
Frank, I told you, you're cut off.

36
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,680
This ain't a charity.

37
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,839
- Just one dance. Come on now.
- Frank, get off!

38
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,953
You know I'm good for it.

39
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,191
Good for nothing.

40
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,839
Hey there.

41
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,550
I like your hat.

42
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,351
My daddy used to have a hat like this.

43
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,470
Me and you...

44
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,836
- ...we could have some fun with that hat.
- Amber, listen.

45
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,390
Stop. Can't you see
I'm talking to somebody?

46
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,631
- Who, this guy?
- Yes, this guy.

47
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,999
We were having a wonderful conversation
about my daddy, so get out of here.

48
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,834
Hey, shithead.

49
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,912
You talking to my girl?

50
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,919
Sir...

51
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,515
...just leave me out of this.

52
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,558
Look, what I said was...

53
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,239
See, today...

54
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,631
...we all learned about
a real important word...

55
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,110
...and that word is "consent."

56
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,316
What?

57
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,440
You see, if two people wanna make love,
that's a very beautiful thing...

58
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,195
...if it's between two consenting adults.

59
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,479
But if the lady keeps saying no
and you just keep going anyway, well...

60
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,751
...you're just a piece of shit, really.

61
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,640
Please, leave me alone! Help.

62
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,117
I'm sorry, man. Just please let me...

63
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,398
Well, I think she told you...

64
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,040
...quite clearly...

65
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,680
...to leave her alone.

66
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,275
So I think you owe her an apology.

67
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,912
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

68
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,634
For?

69
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,354
For being a piece of shit.

70
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,830
I'm a piece of shit.

71
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,997
- Are you a piece of shit?
- I'm a piece of shit.

72
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,196
- Really?
- Yes!

73
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
- Say it again.
- I'm a piece of shit!

74
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,875
All right. Good.

75
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,152
It's all right, buddy.

76
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,356
It's over now.

77
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,670
I ain't gonna lie, you'll probably have
a pretty bad headache in the morning.

78
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,999
Get this guy some ice cream.

79
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,799
- You like ice cream?
- Yeah.

80
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,111
Always makes me feel better.

81
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,715
Rocky road or something.

82
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,554
You...

83
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,279
You wanna get out of here?

84
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,150
Let's go.

85
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,674
That was amazing.

86
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,277
- I thought you killed him at first.
- No, I don't kill people.

87
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,397
Well, I try not to, anyway.

88
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,791
Say, you got a place around here?

89
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,560
About six blocks down the road.

90
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,480
Good.

91
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,916
Because I sleep in my car.

92
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,956
What's the matter, you can't decide?

93
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,874
These old things? No, I'm just looking
for all the luck I can get.

94
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,955
Figure one of them's
gotta have something to it.

95
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,793
So you from around here?

96
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,672
As of late, yeah.

97
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,560
How come I haven't seen you
at the bar before?

98
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,839
I stay to myself mostly,
but I do venture out every now and then.

99
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,834
So it'll be 100 dollars for the night.

100
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,760
I usually charge 150,
but I really do like this hat.

101
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,389
Pardon me, I did enjoy a few last night...

102
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,839
...but I don't think I recall entering
into that sort of agreement.

103
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,320
What are you, fucking stupid?

104
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,476
Do you think that a girl
that looks like this...

105
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,077
...is gonna be in a shithole bar like that
if it wasn't for a damn paycheck?

106
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,555
- Don't turn away from me!
- Quiet now.

107
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,872
<i>Another murder in the town</i>
<i>of Chicory Creek.</i>

108
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,471
<i>This is the latest killing in a town</i>
<i>that has had three triple homicides...</i>

109
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,233
<i>...in the last week alone.</i>

110
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,790
<i>The authorities say</i>
<i>the killings are unrelated.</i>

111
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,593
<i>Later on tonight, though...</i>

112
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,991
I'll be damned.

113
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,439
You can't just leave.

114
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,876
You owe me money.

115
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,437
Thank you.

116
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,438
Come again.

117
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,352
Good morning to you, ma'am.

118
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,000
Holy hell.

119
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,277
Ain't you little Evelyn Pierce?

120
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,433
My God, I ain't seen you
in maybe 20-some odd years.

121
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,954
Otis, right?

122
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,873
Yeah.

123
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,719
You looking real fine, Evy,
I gotta tell you that.

124
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
Like, you must be doing
really well for yourself.

125
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,552
Looking for Chief Dunham. Is he available?

126
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah... No, actually, the chief,
he's currently indisposed...

127
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,552
...so he's got
a very pressing investigation...

128
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,632
...at the time, so...

129
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,033
Basically, he told me nobody is allowed
inside whatsoever, not even you, Evy.

130
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,315
But I'll tell you what,
if you, maybe, have some time...

131
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,312
...and wanna have some company...

132
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,789
...you and I could go down the street,
maybe grab a coffee, doughnut...

133
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,196
It's Agent Pierce.

134
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,680
I'm here on business.

135
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,996
No shit.

136
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,836
Look at you, then, little Evelyn.

137
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,437
You grew up and became yourself
a big, old, bad <i>federale.</i>

138
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,199
I'll be goddamned.

139
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,751
Officer Willard,
I gotta tell you something.

140
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,952
I hate being called Evelyn.

141
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,954
So just stick with the formal.
Agent Pierce.

142
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,352
All right. What, the bureau done
got you all serious now?

143
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,635
All right, Agent Pierce.

144
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,918
- I'm gonna go tell him you're here.
- No need. I'll do it myself.

145
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,710
All right. Hey,
you can't park out here, neither.

146
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,357
- Supposed to be parked around back.
- Well, then you go park it.

147
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,230
I'm not parking anything.

148
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,755
I'll stay right here with a cigarette.

149
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,271
Look, as a spiritual leader
in the community...

150
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,354
...I should be kept in the loop
of this investigation.

151
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,395
The more I know, the better I can guide.

152
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,632
Well, again, I'm gonna take your interest
into account...

153
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,713
...but I'm kind of busy.
I got a meeting here in five minutes.

154
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,155
Say no more, Marty.

155
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,435
I can see you got a full plate.

156
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,632
Come in.

157
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,800
Pastor.

158
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,280
Well, Evelyn Pierce!

159
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,558
My, this is a surprise. They told me
they were sending someone...

160
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,276
...from the Jackson field office,
but I had no idea it'd be you.

161
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,675
You know, it is great to see you.

162
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,320
It's been how many years?

163
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,352
A very long time, Chief Dunham.

164
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,031
I've been looking for a good excuse
to come back here to visit.

165
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,080
Well, now, tell me, Agent Pierce, is it...?

166
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,990
Is it really necessary
bringing in the bureau and all?

167
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,557
You have had three triple homicides
in the past week, correct?

168
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,838
Well, now, that is technically true...

169
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,078
...but ain't nothing that the good men
and women of the C.C.D.P...

170
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,200
- ...can't handle on their own.
- No one's trying to do your job for you.

171
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,512
I don't wanna be here just as much
as you don't want me to be here.

172
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,997
If this was just one murder,
it would not fall under our jurisdiction.

173
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,790
But it's been three separate cases
committed by three separate perps.

174
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,032
Means it could be domestic terrorism
and we investigate that.

175
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,396
You know what, Agent Pierce?
I can assure you...

176
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,394
...there are no terrorists here
in old Chicory Creek.

177
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,552
I'm sure you're right.

178
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,315
My job is to make sure
that these cases are unrelated...

179
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,278
...and I will be on my way.

180
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,673
Well, now, you know what?
That makes good sense. I like that.

181
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,150
They are unrelated, right?

182
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,119
Yeah.

183
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,272
Well, they might be
the tiniest bit related...

184
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,955
...if you was to look at them
in a certain way.

185
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,315
- And what way would that be, chief?
- Each one killed the last.

186
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,873
Yes, that is true.

187
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,679
Excuse me, who are you?

188
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,914
Sir, I told you, you cannot be in here.

189
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,150
Chief, I'm sorry.

190
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,432
I'm sorry. He don't listen very well.
He just barged right past me.

191
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,034
Jebediah Woodley.

192
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,233
Mr. Woodley, you can't just come in
and barge in like this.

193
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,471
Listen, tough guy,
put them hands behind your back.

194
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,154
- In a minute.
- Mr. Woodley...

195
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,074
...this is a private meeting.
I have to ask you to please leave.

196
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,471
- Real private, the three of us.
- Okay, funny man.

197
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,519
- Put them big hands behind your head.
- Sir...

198
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,518
...your town is in real danger.

199
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,598
- I'm here to help.
- Mr. Woodley...

200
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,872
...you are interrupting
an active FBI investigation.

201
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,394
- You're FBI?
- Yes.

202
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,513
Well, that's a use of tax dollars
I can get behind.

203
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,273
Get this assclown out of here!

204
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,472
All right. Come with me. Come on.

205
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,757
You want these murders to stop,
you best listen.

206
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,877
You have some information
on these murders?

207
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,838
Yep. Get him away from me.

208
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,754
I prefer to have you in cuffs,
but okay. Let him go.

209
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,555
Make it quick, Mr. Woodley.

210
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,439
Let me just start by saying...

211
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,832
...you're not gonna believe
one damn thing I'm about to say.

212
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,473
But that don't make it a lie.

213
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,276
Why don't you start with who you are
and what you know?

214
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,436
I'm a hunter.

215
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,550
Well, lookie.

216
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,994
Demon hunter.

217
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,912
Demon hunter.

218
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,640
For a second, I thought
you weren't wasting our time.

219
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,430
- Get this guy out of here, in cuffs.
- I've done this 100 times, honey.

220
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,671
- Come on, demon hunter.
- Get him out of here.

221
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,513
- That's enough, Mr. Woodley.
- I tell people what I do...

222
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,356
...they just sit there, looking dumbstruck
or roll around and laugh.

223
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,513
Then they gotta see something
with their own eyes that proves it.

224
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,356
Maybe they see me pull one of these
things out of their son, body twitching...

225
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,194
...and flapping in ways
the human body ought not to do.

226
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,115
Or they see their mama look back
at them with those dead, black eyes.

227
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,192
Or sometimes they never do come around.

228
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,912
That is, until they get possessed
themselves and feel indescribable pain...

229
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,551
...and fear that comes with losing control
of your body as your conscious self...

230
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,033
...your soul burns and evaporates
into the abyss, like you never was.

231
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,991
Every once in a while, I'll meet someone,
or maybe a pair of folks...

232
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,477
...that aren't so thickheaded as to think
that it's pure coincidence...

233
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,758
...that I end up here
in the middle of fucking nowhere...

234
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,233
...and, without asking, know exactly
the patterns of the murders in question.

235
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,631
And when those people put
their trust in me...

236
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,116
...and just let their doubts aside...

237
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,715
...then lives are saved,
lives that would've been lost...

238
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,430
...had I just got tossed out of here,
had to do all this shit on my own.

239
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,314
But you know, sometimes,
the lives saved are their own.

240
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,394
Now, having heard that,
are you gonna hear me out?

241
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,600
Are you?

242
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,558
Are you gonna hear me out?

243
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,431
Make sure you keep an eye on him.

244
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,075
Where are you off to?

245
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,431
None of your business.

246
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,310
The eyes.

247
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,151
Ask about the eyes.

248
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,555
Kind of dark in here.

249
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,951
I'll see if I can find the light.

250
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,120
Pretty messy, huh?

251
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,234
Do you have those pictures?

252
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,914
Yeah.

253
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,433
This is the daughter here?

254
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,153
Yeah. That's her.

255
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,871
- And that's the son over there?
- Yup, that's him.

256
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,752
And Mr. Banks killed them both?

257
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,151
No, no, he shot the daughter.

258
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,470
Father shot this one.

259
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,994
After shooting Mr. Banks.

260
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,312
You're saying he killed him
and then he killed his own kid?

261
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,676
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Well...

262
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,119
- There was a live witness on this one?
- Yup.

263
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,071
I'm gonna need to talk to them.

264
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,234
<i>Seven-eight-three-one-zero, 7-8-3-1-0.</i>

265
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,836
Mrs. Macullum?

266
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,558
My name is Evelyn Pierce,
I'm with the FBI.

267
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,553
Is it all right if I come in
and have a word with you?

268
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,437
I'm really sorry to disturb you.

269
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,435
I know you're going through
a terrible ordeal.

270
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,557
I just need to ask you a few questions.

271
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,239
They always used to fight.

272
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,031
Who? Who used to fight?

273
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,390
Benjamin and Bethany.

274
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,072
So rambunctious.

275
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,757
They could ruin an entire house
if you didn't keep an eye on them.

276
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,073
Those... Were those your kids?

277
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,749
I used to scream at them.

278
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,991
I'd get so angry.

279
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,396
But I didn't want them hurting each other.

280
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,200
I didn't want them growing up so...

281
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,713
...violently.

282
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,590
But they were just playing.

283
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,070
That was not violence.

284
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,560
I never knew what violence was.

285
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,993
Mrs. Macullum, I just need you
to tell me what happened...

286
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,800
I think about all the times
I sent them to their room.

287
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,078
All the times
I didn't speak to them, the time...

288
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,754
The time I lost with them
that I'll never have back.

289
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,640
Daniel always let them fight.

290
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,279
They were fighting that night
when Marcus came in.

291
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
And when Marcus came in, what happened?

292
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,117
He shot Bethany.

293
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,958
If you need a bit more time, I...

294
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,518
But Daniel, he was quick to draw.

295
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,232
<i>He was a Marine, on leave from Iraq.</i>

296
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,675
<i>So strong.</i>

297
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,240
That's why I married him.

298
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,314
I wanted my children to come
from a strong man like Daniel.

299
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,440
And he told me to hide in the closet,
and he shot that bastard Marcus.

300
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,990
Shot him dead.

301
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,159
My husband, he did.

302
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,153
He shot Benjamin.

303
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,559
My Daniel shot our boy.

304
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,680
And then he came after me.

305
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,360
- Why, why, why?
- Mrs. Macullum, just settle down.

306
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,193
- I can come back another time.
- Why, why, why?

307
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,840
Why, why?

308
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,714
And his eyes, they were black.

309
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,916
Black, black, black.

310
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,551
His eyes were black, black, black.

311
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,870
They were black.

312
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,516
Where did he go?

313
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,116
It's Agent Evelyn Pierce. I need to be
connected to Deacon Shepherd's office.

314
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,316
<i>Agent Pierce?</i>

315
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,394
Sir, I still have this Woodley in custody.
Has Records gotten back to you?

316
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,394
<i>Yeah. Turns out he has</i>
<i>a pretty respectful rap sheet.</i>

317
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,394
<i>Aggravated assault, resisting arrest,</i>
<i>the list goes on and on.</i>

318
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,997
I don't think he's a suspect, but he
definitely knows more than he should.

319
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,914
<i>The murders haven't stopped,</i>
<i>so see what he knows.</i>

320
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,719
Yes, sir.

321
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,113
Thank you.

322
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,834
Hey, now.

323
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,839
That was quicker than I thought.

324
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,033
Tell me what you know.

325
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,279
Well, I don't know.

326
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,357
I'm kind of hungry now.

327
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,155
These are really great ribs.

328
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,920
So...

329
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,314
...you have a demon.

330
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,793
Just one, and I know which, because
I been chasing him for half my damn life.

331
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,152
How do you know
that this demon is the one you seek?

332
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,200
Its means of transfiguration.
The way it changes form.

333
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,714
It's unique.

334
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,352
I'm not gonna sit here and talk about
the history of these pieces of shit.

335
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,955
I don't know if there's God or hell,
but these things exist.

336
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,796
I know because I've killed them.
They've killed friends of mine.

337
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,913
I don't give a rat's ass
if you believe in it or not...

338
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,518
...but I don't want you to mess this one up
for me. So just do what I tell you...

339
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,314
...and you might just survive.

340
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,995
You said this one is unique. How?

341
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,310
Every demon's different, but they all have
their own means of transfiguration.

342
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,359
<i>Some only stay in you</i>
<i>for a couple of seconds...</i>

343
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,591
<i>...you know, like you didn't even know it.</i>

344
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,276
Others will take you over
for their entire lives.

345
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,320
And you have to pry them loose,
which is often easier said than done.

346
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,480
With some of them, just gotta touch you.

347
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,710
Others will only pass
through sexual exchanges.

348
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,438
Some of these things will just leave you,
stick to a doorway...

349
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,799
...Iike an invisible spider web
just waiting for the next fella to walk past.

350
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,478
Most of them like to move.
I like the ones that stay in one place.

351
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,111
But they all have one thing in common:
they exist to destroy.

352
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,720
<i>There's just something about us,</i>
<i>about our world, that they wanna end.</i>

353
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,596
So, what about this one?
How does this one work?

354
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,192
Many years ago, my old man and I,
we came across a small town...

355
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,317
...not unlike this one y'all got here.

356
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,392
<i>Thing had been there for a couple of days.</i>

357
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,717
<i>Nearly the whole town had gotten killed.</i>

358
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,078
<i>It was unusual because demons</i>
<i>normally aren't responsible...</i>

359
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,551
...for those type of body counts.
They're more partial to personal torment.

360
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,354
This thing was different. See, the way
it transfigured was by being killed.

361
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,352
The moment you killed it, it became you.

362
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,309
Which, needless to say,
complicated things.

363
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,599
<i>So anyway, me and my dad sat there,</i>
<i>explained this thing to the town folks...</i>

364
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,399
<i>...just like I'm explaining it now.</i>

365
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,440
<i>They believed us straight on,</i>
<i>having seen the carnage themselves.</i>

366
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,432
Okay. So how'd you kill it?

367
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,751
<i>See, my old man had the brave idea.</i>

368
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,718
<i>He sacrificed himself.</i>

369
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,078
<i>He drank a poison, and then he killed it.</i>

370
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,635
<i>So the demon had no place to go.</i>

371
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,912
<i>And I could trap it.</i>

372
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,635
Well, I'm so sorry.

373
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,360
I lost my daddy to prostate cancer.

374
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,479
- That's a shame.
- So how did you lose the demon?

375
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,552
I'm getting to it. It's complicated.

376
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,871
I tried to hang on to it for 30 years.

377
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,760
It just had a funny way
of slipping out of my hands.

378
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,391
The thing has a life of its own.
It doesn't wanna stay in a box.

379
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,950
It's got a way of influencing
the world around it.

380
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,192
- Okay. How did you lose it?
- You can't kill the thing.

381
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,353
All you can do is put it
where no one will ever get to it.

382
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,036
So I rented a plane, came down here.
Was gonna drop it here in the bayou.

383
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,873
Engine trouble...

384
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,236
...fire starts, I gotta bail out.

385
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,357
Thing just scatters itself
all around town.

386
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,916
I remember investigating that crash.

387
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,150
Good for you.

388
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,872
Anyhow, middle of the bayou ain't
a bad place to hide the thing.

389
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,000
So I stuck around town for a while,
just in case someone stumbled upon it.

390
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,590
Which is good,
because that's what happened.

391
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,200
Well, some nice trees they have here.

392
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,149
Seem to have forgotten my wallet.

393
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,118
Fine. This one's on me.

394
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,516
Thank you very much.

395
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,238
So let's just say any part of that is true.

396
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,914
You got a plan?

397
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,232
I suggest you find the man that killed
the last of those three murderers.

398
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,036
Hold a town meeting with everyone
except him, tell them what happened...

399
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,157
...and maybe we can work together on this.

400
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,070
You wanna tell an entire town there's
a body-hopping demon on the loose?

401
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,193
- Something like that.
- That will only exacerbate things.

402
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,511
If they believe you,
which I highly doubt...

403
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,878
...this town is ultra-Christian.
They're gonna go into a panic.

404
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,472
Chief, is there an emergency system
at the local school...

405
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,552
...so we can keep the children safe?

406
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,871
You're gonna have to pardon me...

407
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,874
...but you spent a little
too much time in Washington.

408
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,952
This here's Chicory Creek, Mississippi.

409
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,840
We got our first stoplight
about six months ago.

410
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,717
I'm sorry, but this plan is ridiculous.

411
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,510
I'm not gonna let you get this town
into a frenzy on your word alone.

412
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,479
Fine. I'll wait for you to wise up then.

413
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,633
Chief, how can I find the man
who killed the last murderer?

414
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,191
- What are you gonna do with him?
- I'll sit him down for a quiet little chat.

415
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,919
If we help you, then I'm coming.

416
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,591
As much as I'd love to spend time
with a lovely lady like yourself...

417
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,750
...I work alone.

418
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,755
We're gonna do this my way,
or you can take a seat back in that cell.

419
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,235
Your choice.

420
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,870
All right, then.

421
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,876
And if you make one false move,
I will not hesitate to shoot you myself.

422
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,078
Fair enough.
Let's get my shit and get going.

423
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,911
Let's see what we got in here.

424
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,640
So one Ruger.

425
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,952
Three-five-seven Magnum...

426
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,353
...and holster with 12 rubber bullets.

427
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,397
I like this here, one vaporizer.

428
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,319
- One small animal trap.
- Careful with that.

429
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,273
South American bola balls.

430
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,431
And last but not least...

431
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,720
...one whip with two shrunken heads.

432
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,150
- Oh, shit, just put down "whip."
- One whip.

433
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,320
What?

434
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,395
All right. Pull over. This should be it.

435
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,836
The house of the man
who shot the last murderer.

436
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,152
One Jeremy Ruckner.

437
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,352
What, do you live in your car?

438
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,113
Course you do.

439
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,560
What on earth is that?

440
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,314
It's my net gun.

441
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,000
She's my pride and joy.

442
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,470
How does she work?

443
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,356
Well, pressurized release.

444
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,910
The nets fly out,
they're weighted at the ends.

445
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,595
They knock the victim off its feet,
don't kill it.

446
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,114
Let me see.

447
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,269
Jeez.

448
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,432
Just a little heavier than it looks.

449
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,275
Okay. That should be the house there.

450
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,796
How does he know where he lives
if he's possessed?

451
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,275
Instinct.

452
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,076
Hasn't been any murders for a while.

453
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,471
Reckon he's taking a break.
Seen him do it before.

454
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,797
Somebody's coming.

455
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,230
Hey, you shouldn't
even have that thing on you.

456
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,040
Oh, I'll be holding onto it,
thank you very much.

457
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,436
You shoot him with that, you'll regret it.

458
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,239
Trust me on that.

459
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,314
Wait here.

460
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,396
Howdy.

461
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,593
Oh, my God.

462
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,956
Yeah. It can be a dirty job,
that's for sure.

463
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,079
Oh, my God. It's horrible.

464
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,879
Takes some getting used to.

465
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,035
- Who the fuck are you?
- It can talk?

466
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,274
No. No. He's not supposed to do that.

467
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,033
Unhand me!

468
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,032
- Shit!
- What?

469
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,032
What's the matter?

470
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,995
- It's not him.
- What do you mean, it's not him?

471
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,595
Well, it's him, but he ain't possessed.

472
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,195
Drunk by the smell of him,
but he ain't possessed.

473
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,959
Who the fuck are you?

474
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,600
Sorry, sir.

475
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,719
Well, we seem to have made
some kind of mistake.

476
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,600
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- Mistake?

477
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,717
You nearly broke my arms.

478
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,917
This is complete bullshit, isn't it?

479
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,477
No, it's not bullshit. He's not the guy
who did the last shooting. That's all.

480
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,154
The hell I ain't.

481
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,837
Three days ago I put that crazy bastard
down with that gun right up there.

482
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,595
I'm the best shot in Mississippi.

483
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,678
Okay, so he said he shot him.

484
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,309
Okay. Tell me exactly what happened.

485
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,279
Well, ain't you heard? I shot the fucker.

486
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,954
I got him right in the gut.

487
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,874
Did anybody do anything
to his body after you shot him?

488
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,680
Yeah, Glen Prichard ran up
and finished him off...

489
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,719
...but I'm the one who put him down
and stopped the killing.

490
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,156
- You ask anybody.
- So, what happened to Prichard?

491
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,033
- Where'd he go?
- He ran off.

492
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,756
After he done it,
he just looked at us and... took off.

493
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,151
Probably couldn't stand
the sight of the blood.

494
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,711
- Pussy.
- All right. We're done here.

495
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,917
This does not prove anything.

496
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,039
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Get up.

497
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,912
Hey, you haven't told me
why you shot me with that damn net.

498
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,074
All right. Just was a bad dream.
You just go back to bed. Now, come on.

499
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,160
Merry Christmas.

500
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,277
Wow, do you really have
to do that in the car?

501
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,398
Didn't have enough ribs for lunch?

502
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,436
No, thank you.

503
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,119
Shit.

504
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,314
Damn it.

505
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,557
Car's overheating. Happens all the time.

506
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,234
I should've never trusted you.

507
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,631
- We need to get back to the station.
- Can you shut up?

508
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,440
Excuse me?
You should be kissing my ass right now.

509
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,479
I could've left you in that cell to rot.

510
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,200
- Don't shush me.
- Quiet.

511
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,792
I just saw something.

512
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,120
- I don't see...
- Something's watching us from the woods.

513
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,475
I don't see anything.

514
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,959
Yeah. Right there.

515
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,599
Get in the car. Don't say a word.

516
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,440
Stay quiet.

517
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,356
Get back in the car.

518
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,916
Is this for real?

519
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,796
Okay.

520
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,599
Am I interrupting something?

521
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,475
Oh, shit.

522
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,200
Rubber bullets.
Works when you're in a jam.

523
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,876
- I... I just...
- Breathe, try not to talk.

524
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,277
So I say we set that town meeting around
6 p.m. tomorrow. Sound good to you?

525
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,597
Hi, y'all. Welcome.

526
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,594
Good evening, Mrs. Kravitz.

527
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,434
Maybe you could help?
Do you have a first-aid kit here?

528
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,956
Yes, I have something here somewhere.

529
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,318
That's terrific.
We also need two rooms for the evening.

530
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,633
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
but I only have one room left.

531
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,076
I'm afraid you'll have to share.

532
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,078
You need some help?

533
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,396
No, I was always pretty good
at do-it-yourself surgery.

534
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,514
Thank you for what you did.

535
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,679
Don't thank me. Thank him.

536
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,194
I don't understand.

537
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,397
When I got to you,
I was sure he'd already killed you.

538
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,032
I've never seen it react that way,
the way he looked at you.

539
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,398
I was relieved to see you were alive
until I realized what that meant.

540
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,072
- It wants me to kill it.
- Yeah. It appears so.

541
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,152
- Why?
- It likes you.

542
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,595
Maybe it likes your body,
maybe it likes your soul.

543
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,832
He collects souls,
makes him more powerful.

544
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,992
The eyes, his eyes...

545
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,958
Yeah, I know.

546
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,998
- Creepy as hell, right?
- No, no. It...

547
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,676
In his eyes, I saw something.

548
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,038
There were dark clouds, lightning.

549
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,795
There were people screaming.

550
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,631
It was terrible.

551
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,314
I've never been so afraid.

552
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,317
Now, that's unexpected.

553
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,152
Here, let me help you.

554
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,877
Let me help you.

555
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,794
So how long have you been doing this?

556
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,595
Pretty much as long as I remember.

557
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,956
It was kind of a family business.

558
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,998
Christmas must've been fun.

559
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,597
Thanks for the warning.

560
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,555
So...

561
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,791
...is there any way to get the demon
without hurting anyone?

562
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,751
Well, I think
you're getting ahead of yourself.

563
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,480
If we don't catch the thing, then...

564
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,835
...all this thinking will be for nothing.

565
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,877
Okay. Well...

566
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,793
You're all set.

567
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,680
Thank you.

568
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,919
I'll just change here
if you don't mind turning around.

569
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,117
Okay. Sure. No problem.

570
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,713
Look, I'm just gonna go outside.

571
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,280
Where?

572
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,160
I'm gonna sleep in the car. It's...

573
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,514
It's pretty cozy actually.

574
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,275
There's plenty of space on the floor,
you don't have to...

575
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,473
Hey, Nelson.

576
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,194
Sorry to wake you, buddy.

577
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,832
Yeah. Could you run a lineage check
for me on an Evelyn Pierce?

578
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,835
Cross-reference with your list,
see if anything in that family tree pops up.

579
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,916
I gotta go. Get back to me
as soon as you can, all right?

580
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,436
Trouble sleeping?

581
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,515
I spent my childhood here.
Figured I would pay a visit.

582
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,235
Looks like that was a nice farm
a ways back.

583
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,472
Why was it abandoned?

584
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,712
Well, supposedly...

585
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,280
...it's cursed.

586
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,834
And why is that?

587
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,071
My parents never told me much.

588
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,038
From what I hear,
there was an Easter celebration...

589
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,118
...and I fell in the pool.

590
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,711
I hit my head on the edge as I went in.

591
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,715
I think it was a few minutes before
anyone found me. I was completely blue.

592
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,709
My mother, she grabbed me
and she carried me into the house.

593
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,593
And when she brought me back...

594
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,157
...I was totally fine,
like nothing had happened.

595
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,514
I don't remember any of it,
but I do know what people say.

596
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,077
It's like she brought me back
from the dead. Next thing I do remember...

597
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,960
...is that people were throwing rocks
into our window.

598
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,192
And we just packed up
and we left pretty quickly after that.

599
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,631
Well, Evelyn, I'm sorry to hear all that.

600
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,678
Everyone's got their sob story, right?

601
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,356
You know what I think? Now is
an appropriate time as any to tell you.

602
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,750
I was trying to figure out why
our black-eyed friend up there liked you.

603
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,434
What you saw in his eyes...

604
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,798
...the circumstances of your family's
departure from Chicory Creek...

605
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,390
- ...it all points at one thing.
- What is that?

606
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,839
Well, there's a slim chance
that your ancestors were, and you are...

607
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,753
How do I put this?

608
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,997
Well, look, there are demons, right?

609
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,436
And at the other end of the spectrum...

610
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,599
...there are beings
that descended from the light.

611
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,911
Are we talking about fucking angels now?

612
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,959
Well, you said it. I know. Listen.

613
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,112
Okay. Let's call them angels.

614
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,631
Well, many, many years ago,
according to the Bible and stuff...

615
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,713
...these angels descended to Earth,
they mated with humans.

616
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,160
- They gave rise to this divine bloodline.
- And you're saying I'm one of them.

617
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,155
What you saw in his eyes, your mother
had that ability, birthmarks on your back...

618
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,789
How did you see those?
You turned around? Did you...?

619
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,356
No. There was just a reflection
or something.

620
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,115
- I am the furthest from angelic.
- Just...

621
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,556
Listen to me, if I'm right...

622
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,516
...the stakes just got a whole lot higher.

623
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,870
And why is that?

624
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,795
Because there's a dark place,
another plane, existing next to ours.

625
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,872
It's full of dark things, bad things.

626
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,997
What does that have to do with me?
With my family?

627
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,914
If you are from that divine bloodline...

628
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,356
...you have the ability
to connect with those worlds.

629
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,436
And if the thing consumes your soul,
it will use your body.

630
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,590
And he'll call up his little demon buddies,
thousands of them.

631
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,600
And then Chicory Creek
literally will be hell on Earth.

632
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,754
Why does it need me?
Aren't there others like me?

633
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,191
Well, I'm not too sure there are any.

634
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,037
Listen, I may be wrong, but you'd
better keep your finger off that trigger.

635
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,391
Well, all right now, great to see you too.

636
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,718
Hey, good to see you. Hey, looking good.

637
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,475
- Come in, have a seat.
- That's not what I'm saying.

638
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,429
I'm just saying that I think
we should have a team on standby.

639
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,672
Please, please.
Look, I'm really close here. Trust me.

640
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,116
Just give me a chance.

641
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,795
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

642
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,757
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. It's good.

643
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,794
Hey, hey, come on in. Good to see you.

644
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,073
Oh, shit.

645
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,352
- I know, Father, I know.
- What is this all about?

646
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,831
- It's all gonna be explained in a minute.
- Come now, Marty.

647
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,390
My congregation are truly worried.

648
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,630
Okay? Now, I saw Evelyn Pierce
in your office.

649
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,751
- She is not to be trusted.
- All right.

650
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,518
Why don't you just take a seat...

651
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,478
...for your own sake.

652
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,431
Ladies and gentlemen,
I need to get your attention, please.

653
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,716
Speak up, Dunham.

654
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,914
I'm gonna please ask that you don't shout.

655
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,871
Now, I know y'all got a lot of questions.

656
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,640
And we're gonna take those questions
just as soon as this meeting's done.

657
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,034
In the meantime, I'm gonna have to ask
that you all remain calm.

658
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,311
Now, it has come to my attention...

659
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,552
...that the string of murders
earlier this week were...

660
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,438
Are connected.

661
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,240
- What?! Connected?
- What do you mean?

662
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,596
Quiet now. Calm down now.

663
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,520
It appears...

664
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,672
...some kind of supernatural thing afoot.

665
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,996
What the fuck?

666
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,995
That is not helpful. Now you shut up.

667
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,230
Now sit down. Y'all be quiet.

668
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,474
Y'all know we got the FBI working on this.

669
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,233
Oh, shit.

670
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,671
Okay. Good evening, folks.

671
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,036
I'm Jebediah Woodley.

672
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,274
That's right.

673
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,600
I wanna talk to you a little bit about
what's happened in town this past week.

674
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,436
I know you're all frightened,
as you should be...

675
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,231
...but if you just cooperate
and listen to what I got to say...

676
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,280
...everybody's gonna be fine.
Well, most of you are gonna be fine.

677
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,476
Most of us?

678
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,838
Well, look, just calm down now.
I'm gonna explain it to you.

679
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,799
I'm gonna explain what happened.
See, there's...

680
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,271
Just hear me out now.
We'll get a chance to talk about this later.

681
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,434
I know you aren't gonna believe
some of the things I'm about to say.

682
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,949
Some of you, well... Let me finish up.

683
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,719
I'll explain it to you. There's
something going on with this town...

684
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,716
Some of you are gonna have a problem
believing what I'm about to say now...

685
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,999
...but I gotta tell you something.
Well, it's kind of a strange story.

686
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,714
Oh, shit.

687
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,032
Everybody, evacuate the premises!

688
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,034
Don't shoot it.

689
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,200
Don't shoot it.

690
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,996
For Pete's sake.

691
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,272
Hold still now.

692
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,514
Shit.

693
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,079
What do we do now?

694
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,390
Call for backup.

695
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,429
- This was the backup.
- Shut your mouth, Dunham.

696
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,675
He was trying his best.
They didn't listen to him.

697
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,912
If your men knew how to follow orders,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

698
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,958
I need your car now.

699
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,040
All right.

700
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,998
- Where are you going?
- I'll do this on my own.

701
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,356
- You need us.
- Like hell I do.

702
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,910
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna find it.

703
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:05,480
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

704
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,633
Ready or not, here I come!

705
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,318
You suck at this game.

706
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,836
You know I only play
so that you'll leave me alone.

707
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,315
When's Daddy coming home?

708
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,076
I told you, I don't know.
He's probably still down at the town hall.

709
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,350
Who's that?

710
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,995
- Who's who?
- The man outside.

711
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,836
Get away from the window, Jezz.

712
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,156
Stay back.

713
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,639
Help.

714
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,354
Help.

715
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,639
We need to find him.

716
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,520
Look, I've been thinking this over.
Maybe he was right.

717
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,876
- About what?
- About me.

718
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,035
Maybe it was my fault.
Maybe I shouldn't even be here!

719
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,880
- Come on, don't be a coward.
- I got a heart condition.

720
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,556
Snap out of it! Chief Dunham,
regardless of what Jebediah says...

721
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,189
...the fact remains,
we need all the help we can get.

722
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,990
I understand if you feel guilty
about the deaths of your men...

723
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,677
...but you don't avenge them
by running away. You stand and fight.

724
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,554
Okay? You stand here
and you fight with me, chief.

725
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,116
And you defend this town.

726
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,680
Chief!

727
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,674
Chief.

728
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,230
Chief Dunham, hey!

729
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,958
What's going on here?

730
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,314
You.

731
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,316
Yeah?

732
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,996
- Why did you bring this evil to this town?
- Excuse me?

733
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,198
I do not know what your designs are
in Chicory Creek...

734
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,673
...but I do know that Evelyn Pierce,
like her mother before her...

735
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,958
...had the blood of Satan
flowing in her veins.

736
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,591
And you are in league with her,
are you not?

737
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,199
You got this wrong. Most important thing
is now you calm these people down.

738
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,995
Why, pray tell, should we believe you?!

739
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,559
How are we to know
that you are not in cahoots...

740
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,679
...with this hell spawn
that is attacking this town?

741
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,470
- You better calm down, Padre.
- I will do no such thing.

742
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,031
I see it now.
You are Lucifer's mouthpiece...

743
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,795
...and Evelyn Pierce is his concubine.

744
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,117
- Aren't you taking this a bit far?
- Be gone!

745
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,878
- Be gone, hell spawn!
- Calm down.

746
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,635
- Be gone!
- That's rude. I'd rather you not do that.

747
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,993
- The power of Christ compels you!
- I'm pretty sure that's from <i>The Exorcist.</i>

748
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,231
Be gone, hell spawn!

749
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,040
And tell your lord Lucifer not...

750
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,032
Oh, no.

751
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,677
Calm down, y'all. Rubber bullets.

752
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,436
All right.
Padre, you all right there, Padre?

753
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,958
You all right? Okay.

754
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,629
He'll be okay. He'll be fine.

755
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,558
Merry Christmas.

756
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,912
- What do you want?
- I wanna help you.

757
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,992
You've helped plenty. I got it from here.

758
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,834
We're running out of time.
Plus, I'm the one it wants, right?

759
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,232
So don't you want me around?

760
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,351
That's exactly why
I don't want you around.

761
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,274
Pastor!

762
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,513
Pastor Erikson!

763
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,080
Hey.

764
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,233
Pastor, he's...
Well, he's indisposed right now.

765
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,429
I gotta see the pastor.
My girl, she's gone mad.

766
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,273
- I don't know what to do.
- What's your name?

767
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,230
- Emmett.
- Emmett, tell me what happened now.

768
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,472
Wait a minute, you're the guy
from the town-hall meeting.

769
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,792
What's going on?
Is something making people sick?

770
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,316
Emmett, just tell me
exactly what happened.

771
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,359
I got home about an hour ago.

772
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,951
There was a man outside on the front
lawn with a bullet wound in his head.

773
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:43,351
And I went inside, and my little one,
my girl, she's got a knife to her.

774
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,080
So I tell her to run,
and then she looks at me...

775
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,159
- ...and her eyes were all, like, black.
- Come on. Let's go.

776
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,870
Come on.
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

777
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,875
She's down there.

778
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,156
- No other exit to that basement, right?
- No, sir.

779
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,993
- All right.
- How are we gonna do this?

780
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,870
- Let me think for a second here.
- If she's possessed, she in a lot of pain?

781
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,269
She sure is.

782
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,555
There's gotta be a way I can help.
How can I help her?

783
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,359
- There is a way to do that.
- How?

784
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,400
- The only way is by killing her.
- What? What'd you say to me?

785
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,473
You're gonna be putting her
out of a lot of misery.

786
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,756
I can't.

787
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,311
- I can't kill my little girl.
- That ain't your little girl down there.

788
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,194
I don't understand!

789
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,080
Wouldn't it just be the same problems
but inside of me now?

790
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,630
What we're gonna do
is make poison, you drink it.

791
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,439
You go down there, do the deed...

792
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,157
...wait to die, you will be with your girl.

793
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,039
Wouldn't want her to be alone, would you?

794
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,478
I can't.

795
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,478
- All right. I'll do it.
- No, no!

796
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,236
What...?

797
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,916
- What's she going through right now?
- She is screaming, she's down there.

798
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,958
She's burning up,
waiting for the whole thing to end.

799
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,520
Oh, Jesus.

800
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,435
There's gotta be another way. I can't kill
my daughter, you gotta understand.

801
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,080
You listen to me.

802
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,511
You wanna honor your little girl...

803
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,390
...better put her out of her misery.

804
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,920
All right.

805
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,239
I'll do it.

806
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,355
Come on, Evelyn,
let's make this poison now.

807
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,037
- How long will I have to bear it?
- Couple of minutes, tops.

808
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,950
Jesus, no. I can't.

809
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,079
It's okay. It's okay.

810
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,998
Come on. You ready?

811
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,437
So she'll be at rest?

812
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,990
Once it's inside you, it's out of her.

813
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,714
What's it gonna be like for me?

814
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,358
Well, I'd be lying
if I said it was gonna be pleasant.

815
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,560
Here.

816
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,195
So...

817
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,554
...I take this, and I...

818
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,720
Kill it.

819
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,040
All right.

820
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,997
- I know what I have to do.
- Drink it while it's hot now.

821
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,794
All right.

822
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,435
- Thanks.
- Sure.

823
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,677
Everybody get down on the ground!

824
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,309
What the hell is going on?

825
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,318
I'm sorry.
I thought they'd give me more time.

826
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,193
- You damn fool.
- Shut your mouth!

827
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,990
Guys, I'm not doing too good.

828
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,755
Deacon Shepherd,
look, you're making a huge mistake.

829
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,559
It's nice to see you too.

830
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,394
Give us a few more minutes.
Let us finish what we're doing.

831
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,358
Then you can take over the operation.

832
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,193
Is that an order?

833
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,119
Something's wrong with this one.

834
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,838
What have you done to this man?

835
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,113
Drift leaf, mainly.

836
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,390
It's a poison.

837
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,279
You poisoned this man?

838
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,752
Get him the hell out of here.

839
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,634
Wait.

840
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,510
- What exactly is your role in this?
- Go to hell.

841
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,718
Got it. Hard case. Put him in the van!

842
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,398
As for you, you go outside.
I'll talk to you later.

843
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,155
- Wait. You have no idea...
- I'll deal with you later.

844
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,834
Scour these premises.

845
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,960
Jebediah.

846
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,554
- Jebediah, I...
- Don't.

847
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,757
They would've come
even if I hadn't called.

848
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,798
- What do they know?
- Everything.

849
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,078
- I didn't think they would believe me.
- We'll deal with this later. Get ready.

850
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,556
Check the door.

851
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,552
Turn around right now. Uncuff him.

852
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,435
Don't do this.

853
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,950
Uncuff him right now.

854
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,953
- Hold it.
- You idiot!

855
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,755
We have to go now. Now!

856
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,194
Get in the damn car!

857
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,394
You're fucking dead.

858
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,119
She's got the gun, smartass.

859
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,235
- What was that?
- It was exactly what I told you.

860
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,120
No, that can't be.
There must be some kind of...

861
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,875
- There isn't.
- We need you to cooperate with us.

862
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,077
You wouldn't touch me.

863
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,359
Without my testimony, you're both gonna
be on the hook for that bloodbath there.

864
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,638
Testimony? I don't think you understand
the time frame we're under here.

865
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,872
I have been shot. I'm wounded.

866
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,157
We're gonna get me some medical attention.

867
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,040
Then we'll talk about
what happened back there!

868
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,192
- Please, okay, okay.
- What happened while we were outside?

869
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,439
The little girl...

870
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,839
...she came out of the back room.

871
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,639
She... She attacked...

872
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,959
She killed three of my men.

873
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,159
We fired on her.

874
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,636
And then one of my guys fired on me,
clipped me in the shoulder.

875
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,440
Then what happened?

876
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,999
I fired on him, and then I ran.

877
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,992
Fuck you both. You'd have run too.

878
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,389
Okay. Did you hit him?

879
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,157
Yeah. Yes, but it wasn't a kill shot.

880
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,755
- Where'd you hit him?
- Lower abdomen.

881
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,877
All right. Cuff him now.

882
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,595
What? What is this? Wait a minute.

883
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,351
What the fuck are you doing?
I am with you, okay?

884
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,512
You're both fucking crazy!

885
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:49,320
Clearly, there's something
very unnatural going on here.

886
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,997
Why don't we get in the car, drive back,
I'll explain everything, all will be forgiven.

887
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:58,200
- I don't think we have time for that.
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

888
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,039
I'll do it.

889
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,953
I'll fucking do it.

890
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,712
Agent Pierce.

891
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,874
I'm sorry, Jebediah.

892
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:16,034
Trust me, if it weren't for me,
those men back there, they'd still be alive.

893
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,229
You should've told me. Let's just
be clear with each other from now on.

894
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,872
What are we gonna do with him?

895
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,560
Well, we're just gonna find
a suitable place and end this.

896
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,475
And who's gonna kill it?

897
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,360
Well, I'm just gonna have
to figure something out.

898
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,117
It doesn't have to be like this.

899
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,272
We can keep going.
We can find another way.

900
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:58,434
There is no other way.
Someone has to die. That's the rules.

901
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,474
Yeah, but you're...
You're important. You're...

902
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,518
Why am I important?

903
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,919
Because I kill demons?

904
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,799
Should you wanna die instead of me?

905
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,600
Would I like for this to be someone else?

906
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,552
You bet your ass.

907
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,194
But you're different.

908
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,599
You got that power inside of you
that you have to harness.

909
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,399
You're important.

910
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,473
Hell of a lot more important
than I am in this fight.

911
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,520
Let's get this over with.

912
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,718
It's got one bullet.

913
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,234
All right.

914
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,758
Take care of my car.

915
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,155
Stop!

916
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,993
Damn it, what's with this guy?

917
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,915
What in the name of God
are you doing to this poor man?

918
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,278
- Padre, you're gonna have to stop.
- Don't take another step!

919
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,837
Pastor Erikson, you need to leave.
You don't know...

920
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,957
And I do not wish to know.

921
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,952
- Free this man!
- Wait, don't do it!

922
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,318
Restrain him!

923
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,753
Get off me.

924
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,195
What are you doing?

925
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,795
Think about it.
You saw the demon. You saw it.

926
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,559
You shut your mouth!

927
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,357
You will not poison me.

928
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,150
I'm trying to help you, pastor.
What are you gonna do, kill me?

929
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,954
Be gone, devil!

930
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,998
Get away from me.

931
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,194
No.

932
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,275
There's no chance.

933
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,238
There's no fucking chance.

934
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,274
You heard the lady.

935
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,512
Oh, you sick fucker.

936
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,035
Evelyn, don't do it!

937
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,192
Don't kill it!

938
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,995
<i>I've been doing this a long time.</i>

939
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:47,120
<i>I can't tell you if there's a heaven</i>
<i>or hell or what's out there.</i>

940
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,672
<i>But one thing I can tell you for certain</i>
<i>is that evil exists.</i>

941
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,634
<i>You can run away from it,
you can bury it...</i>

942
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,360
<i>...maybe you can even slow it down...</i>

943
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,517
<i>...but you can't stop it.</i>

944
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,833
<i>Sooner or later,</i>
<i>maybe not even in your lifetime...</i>

945
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,310
<i>...that evil will be back.</i>
