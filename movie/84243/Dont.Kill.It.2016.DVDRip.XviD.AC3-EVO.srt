1
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,502
Get him, boy.

2
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,534
Titus!

3
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:18,143
Come here, boy!

4
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:34,783
Hey! Titus!

5
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:36,254
Titus!

6
00:02:04,544 --> 00:02:06,238
There you are, boy.

7
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:12,671
What the hell's the matter
with you?

8
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,326
Nicely done, Titus.

9
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:34,782
Looks like I got me
a treasure-sniffing dog.

10
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,478
Titus, Titus, Titus. No!

11
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,639
No, no, no!

12
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,334
Titus, no!

13
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,174
No.

14
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:57,439
No.

15
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,462
Your father's home early.

16
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,998
Hey there, how'd it go?

17
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,215
Thanks for reading to me.
I need reading glasses

18
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,814
no problem.
One day.

19
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:25,055
Sure we'll like this...

20
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,830
Gabriel?

21
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:31,071
Are you all right?
What's the matter?

22
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,462
Baby? Baby?

23
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,318
Gabriel,
you son of a bitch.

24
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:26,814
Daddy?

25
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:06,238
You look so pretty,
i wanna twirl you like a top.

26
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,958
Stop.
Come on, Amber.

27
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,070
Wanna play something sexy
and dance? Hm?

28
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,918
No, I don't.
Don't touch me.

29
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:16,926
Come on, now.

30
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:18,302
Just one dance, huh?

31
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,030
Come on, like old times,
like old times--

32
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:21,534
frank, stop.

33
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:24,030
Amber, why are you teasing me
like this then?

34
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:26,206
Frank, I told you,
you're cut off.

35
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,870
This ain't a charity.

36
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,910
Just one dance. Come on, now.
Frank, get off.

37
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,782
You know I'm good for it.

38
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:36,958
Good for nothing.

39
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:42,462
Hey there.

40
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,854
I like your hat.

41
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:49,663
My daddy used to have
a hat like this.

42
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:54,590
Me and you...Could have
some fun with that hat.

43
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:55,998
Amber, listen.

44
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,334
Stop. Can't you see
I'm talking to somebody?

45
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,254
Who, this guy?
Yes, this guy.

46
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:02,399
We were just having
a wonderful conversation

47
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,638
about my daddy,
so get out of here.

48
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:10,558
Hey, shithead.
You talking to my girl?

49
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,158
Sir,

50
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,782
just leave me out of this.

51
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:17,054
Look, what I said was--

52
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,278
see, today...

53
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,839
We all learned about
a real important word

54
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,102
and that word is
"consent."

55
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:44,126
What?

56
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:46,750
You see, if two people
wanna make love,

57
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:48,062
that's a very
beautiful thing

58
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:50,751
if it's between
two consenting adults.

59
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:51,966
If the lady keeps
saying no,

60
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:55,006
and you just keep going
anyway, well...

61
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,511
You're just a piece
of shit, really.

62
00:07:56,512 --> 00:08:00,190
Please, leave me alone. Help.

63
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,366
I'm really sorry, man.
Just please let me--

64
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:05,022
well, I think she
told you

65
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:06,750
quite clearly...

66
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,574
To leave her alone.

67
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:11,166
So I think you owe her
an apology.

68
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:14,751
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

69
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:17,214
For?

70
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:18,974
For being a piece
of shit.

71
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,150
I'm a piece of shit.

72
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:23,230
Are you a piece of shit?
I'm a piece of shit.

73
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:24,510
Really?
Yes.

74
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,750
Say it again.
I'm a piece of shit.

75
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:29,054
Ugh!
All right. Good.

76
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,990
It's all right,
buddy.

77
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:35,742
It's over now.
I ain't gonna lie to you,

78
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:38,334
you'll probably have a pretty
bad headache in the morning.

79
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:40,478
Get this guy some
ice cream.

80
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,239
You like ice cream?
Yeah.

81
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,414
Always makes me
feel better.

82
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,230
Rocky road
or something.

83
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:50,462
You-- you wanna get
out of here?

84
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:56,030
Let's go.
That was amazing.

85
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:58,046
I thought you killed him
at first.

86
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,870
No,
i don't kill people.

87
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,886
Well, I try not to,
anyway.

88
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:04,318
Say, you got a place
around here?

89
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,038
About six blocks down
the road.

90
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,606
Good.

91
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:11,134
Because I sleep
in my car.

92
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:39,390
What's the matter,
you can't decide?

93
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:41,054
Oh. Heh.

94
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:42,526
These old things?

95
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:44,926
No, I'm just looking
for all the luck I can get.

96
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:48,030
Figure one of them's
gotta have something to it.

97
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:50,014
So you from around here?

98
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,334
As of late, yeah.

99
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:56,574
How come I haven't seen you
at the bar before?

100
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:58,750
I stay to myself
mostly,

101
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:01,406
but I do venture out
every now and then.

102
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,942
So it'll be a hundred dollars
for the night.

103
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:11,645
I usually charge 150,
but I really do like this hat.

104
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:14,270
Pardon me, I did enjoy
a few last night,

105
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:16,766
but I don't think I recall
entering into

106
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:20,158
that sort of agreement.
What are you, fucking stupid?

107
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,773
Do you think that a girl
that looks like this

108
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,854
is gonna be in
a shithole bar like that

109
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:27,486
if it wasn't
for a damn paycheck?

110
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:32,510
Don't turn away from me.
Quiet now.

111
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:35,934
<i> Another murder</i>
<i> in the town of chicory creek.</i>

112
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,310
<i> This is the latest killing</i>

113
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:39,454
<i> in a town that has had</i>
<i> three triple homicides</i>

114
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:41,374
<i> in the last week alone.</i>

115
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,358
<i> The authorities say</i>
<i> the killings are unrelated.</i>

116
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,374
<i> Later on tonight, though... </i>

117
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:48,062
I'll be damned.

118
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,982
You can't just leave.

119
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,094
You owe me money.

120
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:58,718
Thank you. Come again.

121
00:12:57,823 --> 00:12:59,934
Good morning to you,
ma'am.

122
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:01,406
Holy hell.

123
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:03,326
Ain't you little
Evelyn Pierce?

124
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:06,718
My god, I ain't seen you
in maybe 20-some odd years.

125
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,061
Otis, right?

126
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,398
Yeah.

127
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,438
You looking real fine, evy,
i gotta tell you that.

128
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,678
Like, you must be doing
really well for yourself.

129
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,334
I'm looking for chief Dunham.
Is he available?

130
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:19,933
Uh, yeah--

131
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:24,094
no, actually, the chief--
he's currently indisposed, so...

132
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,942
He's got a very pressing
investigation

133
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:28,670
at the time, so--

134
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:30,622
basically,
he told me nobody

135
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:34,046
is allowed inside whatsoever,
not even you, evy.

136
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,262
But I'll tell you what,

137
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:38,270
if you, maybe,
have some time

138
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:40,030
and wanna have some company,

139
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:42,173
you and I could go down
the street,

140
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:45,374
maybe grab a coffee, donut.
Hm...

141
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,390
It's agent Pierce.

142
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,118
I'm here on business.

143
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,334
No shit.

144
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:52,862
Look at you then,
little "evil lyn."

145
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:56,413
You grew up and became yourself
a big old bad federale.

146
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,141
I'll be goddamned.

147
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,110
Officer Willard,
i gotta tell you something.

148
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:06,398
I hate being called
"evil lyn."

149
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,278
So just stick with the formal.
Agent Pierce.

150
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,830
All right. What, the bureau done
got you all serious now?

151
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,702
All right, agent Pierce.

152
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:19,005
I'm gonna go tell him
you're here.

153
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:20,925
No need.
I'll do it myself.

154
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,101
All right, hey, you can't park
out here, neither.

155
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,926
It's supposed to be parked
around back.

156
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:27,230
Well, then you go park it.

157
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,389
I'm not parking anything.

158
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:34,686
I'll stay right here
with a cigarette.

159
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:36,414
Look...

160
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,653
As a spiritual leader
in the community

161
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:42,430
I should be kept in the loop
of this investigation.

162
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:45,277
The more I know,
the better I can guide.

163
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,350
Well, again, I'm gonna take
your interest into account,

164
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,781
but I'm kind of busy now.
I got a meeting here

165
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:52,798
in five minutes.
Say no more, Marty.

166
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,006
I can see you got
a full plate.

167
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:57,470
Mm.

168
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,893
Come in.

169
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,022
Pastor. Ahem.

170
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:08,221
Well, Evelyn Pierce.

171
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,046
My, this is a surprise.

172
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,678
They told me they were
sending someone from

173
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,974
the Jackson field office
but I had no idea it'd be you.

174
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:18,013
You know,
it is great to see you.

175
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,774
It's been how many
years?

176
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,694
A very long time,
chief Dunham.

177
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:23,102
I've been looking for
a good excuse

178
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:26,045
to come back here to visit.

179
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:29,949
Well, now, tell me,
agent Pierce, is it--?

180
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:33,725
Is it really necessary
bringing in the bureau and all?

181
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,870
You have had three triple
homicides

182
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:38,173
in the past week,
is that correct?

183
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:41,278
Well, now,
that is technically true,

184
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,510
but ain't nothing that the good
men and women of the c.C.D.P

185
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,654
can't handle on their own.

186
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:48,445
No one's trying to do
your job for you.

187
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,853
I don't wanna be here
just as much

188
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,613
as you don't want me
to be here.

189
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:54,814
If this was one murder, it would
not fall under our jurisdiction.

190
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:57,214
But it's been three separate
cases committed

191
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:58,589
by three separate perps.
Hm.

192
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,350
Means it could be domestic
terrorism,

193
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:02,014
and we investigate that.

194
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,741
You know what, agent Pierce?
I can assure you

195
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:06,814
there are no terrorists here
in old chicory creek.

196
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:08,862
I'm sure you're right.

197
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:11,550
My job is to make sure that
these cases are unrelated

198
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:13,245
and I will be on my way.

199
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:16,702
Well, now, you know what?
That makes good sense.

200
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,718
I like that.

201
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,974
They are unrelated, right?

202
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:24,990
Uh...

203
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:26,622
Yeah.

204
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,678
Well, they might be
the tiniest bit related

205
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,142
if you was to look at them
in a certain way.

206
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:36,062
And what way
would that be, chief?

207
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:38,621
Each one killed the last.

208
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,878
Yes, that is true.

209
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,477
Excuse me, who are you?

210
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:47,549
Sir, I told you,
you cannot be in here.

211
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,406
Chief, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

212
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,934
He don't listen very well.
He just barged right past me.

213
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,694
Jebediah woodley.

214
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:56,382
Mr. woodley, you can't just
come in and barge in like this.

215
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:58,654
Listen, tough guy,
put them hands behind your back.

216
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,158
- In a minute.
- Mr. woodley,

217
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,973
this is a private meeting.
I have to ask you to leave.

218
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,406
- Real private, the three of us.
- Okay, funny man.

219
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:07,486
Let's put them big-ass
hands behind--

220
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:09,246
sir,

221
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,197
your town is in real danger.

222
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,150
I'm here to help.
Mr. woodley,

223
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:16,126
you are interrupting
an active FBI investigation.

224
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,661
You're FBI?
Yes.

225
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:20,766
Well, that's a use of
tax dollars I can get behind.

226
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,525
Now, get this assclown
out of here.

227
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:24,574
All right.
Come with me. Come on.

228
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,717
You want these murders to stop,
you best listen.

229
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,733
You have some information
on these murders?

230
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:30,622
Yep. Get him away
from me.

231
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:33,629
I prefer to have you in cuffs,
but okay. Let him go.

232
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,310
Make it quick, Mr. woodley.

233
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,285
Let me start by saying
you're not gonna believe

234
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,526
one damn thing
I'm about to say.

235
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,181
But that don't make
it a lie.

236
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:57,885
Why don't you start with who
you are and what you know?

237
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:01,277
I'm a hunter.

238
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,405
Demon hunter.

239
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:07,133
Demon hunter.

240
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:09,405
For a second, I thought
you weren't wasting our time.

241
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:11,710
Get this guy out of here,
put him in cuffs.

242
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:13,470
I've done this
100 times, honey.

243
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,581
Come on, demon hunter.
Get him out of here.

244
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,757
That's enough, Mr. woodley.
I tell people what I do,

245
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,702
they just sit there,
looking dumbstruck or laugh.

246
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:23,805
Then they gotta see something
on their own that proves it.

247
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,493
Maybe they see me pull one
of these things out of their son

248
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:28,830
his body twitching
and flapping in ways

249
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,365
the human body ought
not to do.

250
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,478
Or they see their momma
looking back

251
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,142
with those dead,
black eyes.

252
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,222
Or sometimes,
they never do come around.

253
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:38,461
That is, until they
get possessed themselves

254
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,702
and feel indescribable
pain and fear

255
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,622
that comes
with losing control

256
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,061
of your body
as your conscious self,

257
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:47,293
your soul, burns and evaporates
into the abyss,

258
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:48,509
like you never was.

259
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,333
Now, every once
in a while,

260
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:52,286
I'll meet someone,
or maybe a pair of folks

261
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:55,518
that aren't so thickheaded and
think that it's pure coincidence

262
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,813
that I end up here
in the middle of fucking nowhere

263
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:01,182
and without asking,
know exactly

264
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:03,005
the patterns
of the murders in question.

265
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,341
And when those people
put their trust in me

266
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,709
and just let their doubts
aside, then

267
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,270
lives are saved,
lives that would've been lost

268
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:12,094
had I just got tossed
out of here

269
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:13,725
and have to do
all this shit on my own.

270
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:16,701
But, you know, sometimes,
the lives saved are their own.

271
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:19,133
Now,
having heard that,

272
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:20,638
are you gonna hear
me out?

273
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,654
Are you?

274
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:24,766
Are you gonna hear
me out?

275
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,118
Make sure you keep
an eye on him.

276
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,909
Where are you
off to?

277
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:33,693
None of your business.

278
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:35,101
The eyes.

279
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,622
Ask about the eyes.

280
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,589
Kind of...Dark in here.

281
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:12,830
See if I can find
the light.

282
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:25,437
Pretty messy, huh?

283
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:29,150
Do you have those pictures?
Yeah.

284
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:40,125
This is the daughter here?

285
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:42,013
Yeah. That's her.

286
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:47,486
And that's the son over there?
Yup, that's him.

287
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,957
And Mr. banks
killed them both?

288
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,877
No, he shot
the daughter.

289
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,485
Father shot this one--

290
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:01,821
--after shooting Mr. banks.

291
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,358
You're saying he
killed him

292
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,085
and then killed his own kid?
Yeah.

293
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:06,749
Doesn't make any sense.
Well...

294
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,486
You said there was
a live witness on this?

295
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:13,213
Yup.

296
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:15,453
I'm gonna need
to talk to them.

297
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,701
Mrs. macullum?

298
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,885
My name is Evelyn Pierce,
I'm with the FBI.

299
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:37,150
Is it all right if I come in
and have a word with you?

300
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:44,317
I'm really sorry
to disturb you.

301
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,157
I know you're going through
a terrible ordeal.

302
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,398
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

303
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,022
They always used to fight.

304
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,709
Who? Who used to fight?

305
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,157
Benjamin and Bethany.

306
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,270
So rambunctious.

307
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:04,765
They could ruin
an entire house

308
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:06,845
if you didn't keep
an eye on them.

309
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,990
Those--
were those your kids?

310
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:12,413
I used to scream
at them.

311
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,837
I'd get so angry.

312
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,853
But I didn't want them
hurting each other.

313
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:21,085
I didn't want them
growing up so...

314
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,998
Violently.

315
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,133
But they were just playing.

316
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:30,621
That was not violence.

317
00:22:30,623 --> 00:22:33,565
I never knew what
violence was.

318
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,653
Mrs. macullum, I just need you
to tell me what happened--

319
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:41,374
I think about all the times
i sent them to their room.

320
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:44,669
All the times I didn't
speak to them, the time...

321
00:22:46,718 --> 00:22:50,941
The time I lost with them
that I'll never have back.

322
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:54,110
Daniel always let
them fight.

323
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:57,086
They were fighting that night
when Marcus came in.

324
00:22:57,087 --> 00:23:00,541
And when Marcus came in,
what happened?

325
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:17,150
He shot Bethany.

326
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:23,741
If you need a bit
more time, i--

327
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:26,077
but Daniel,
he was quick to draw.

328
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,853
<i> He was a marine,</i>
<i> on leave from Iraq.</i>

329
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:31,165
<i> So strong.</i>

330
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,701
That's why I married him.

331
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:37,310
I wanted my children to come
from a strong man like Daniel.

332
00:23:37,312 --> 00:23:39,293
And he told me to hide
in the closet,

333
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:41,565
and he shot that bastard Marcus.

334
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:46,173
Shot him dead.

335
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,949
My husband, he did.

336
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:59,581
He shot Benjamin.

337
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,589
My Daniel shot our boy.

338
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:15,485
And then he came after me.

339
00:24:18,462 --> 00:24:22,365
Why? Why? Why?
Mrs. macullum, just settle down.

340
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,509
I can come back another time.
Why? Why?

341
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:26,141
Why? Why?

342
00:24:27,774 --> 00:24:30,845
And his eyes,
they were black.

343
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:34,653
Black, black, black.

344
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:38,045
His eyes were black,
black, black.

345
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:39,613
They were black.

346
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:47,773
Where did he go?

347
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,221
It's agent Evelyn Pierce.

348
00:25:00,223 --> 00:25:03,325
I need to be connected
to Deacon Shepherd's office.

349
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,701
<i> Agent Pierce?</i>

350
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,101
Sir, I still have this woodley
in custody.

351
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:08,605
Has records gotten back
to you?

352
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,485
<i> Yeah. Turns out he has</i>
<i> a pretty respectful rap sheet.</i>

353
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:14,205
<i> Aggravated assault, resisting</i>
<i> arrest, the list goes on.</i>

354
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,093
The thing is,
i don't think he's a suspect,

355
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:17,725
but he knows more than
he should.

356
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:20,701
<i> The murders haven't stopped,</i>
<i> so see what he knows.</i>

357
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:22,333
Yes, sir.

358
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:36,093
Hey, now.

359
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:37,949
That was quicker
than I thought.

360
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:40,157
Tell me what you know.

361
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:45,181
Well, I don't know.

362
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:50,013
I'm kind of hungry now.

363
00:25:55,102 --> 00:25:56,637
Mm.

364
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:14,685
These are really great ribs.
Heh, heh.

365
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,053
So...

366
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,869
You have a demon.
Just one, and I know which,

367
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:22,781
because I been chasing him
for half my damn life now.

368
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:25,917
How do you know that this demon
is the one you seek?

369
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,917
Its means of transfiguration,
the way it changes form--

370
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,645
it's unique.

371
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,909
I'm not gonna sit and talk about
the history of these shits.

372
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,469
I don't know if there's god
or hell, but these exist.

373
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,101
I know
because I've killed them.

374
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:41,213
I know 'cause they killed
friends of mine.

375
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:43,005
Mm-hm.
I don't give a rat's ass

376
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:45,117
if you believe in it or not.

377
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:47,709
I don't want you
to mess this up for me.

378
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:50,333
So just do what I tell you...

379
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:52,125
And you might just survive.

380
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:54,813
You said this one
is unique. How?

381
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:56,317
Every demon's different,

382
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,845
but they all have their own
means of transfiguration.

383
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:01,757
<i> Some only stay in you</i>
<i> for a couple seconds,</i>

384
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,093
<i> you know,</i>
<i> like you didn't even know it.</i>

385
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:06,333
Aah!
Others...

386
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,413
<i> Will take you over</i>
<i> for their entire lives.</i>

387
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:10,109
<i> And you have to pry</i>
<i> them loose,</i>

388
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:12,509
which is often easier said
than done.

389
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,477
Some of them
just gotta touch you.

390
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:21,437
Others will only pass
through sexual exchanges.

391
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:27,709
Some of these things will just
leave you to stick to a doorway

392
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,365
like an invisible spider web
just waiting for the next fella

393
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,157
<i> to walk past.</i>

394
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,501
Most of them like
to move.

395
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:35,421
I like the ones that stay
in one place.

396
00:27:35,423 --> 00:27:37,757
But they all have one thing
in common:

397
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,357
They exist to destroy.

398
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,052
<i> There's just something</i>
<i> about us,</i>

399
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:44,061
<i> about our world,</i>
<i> that they wanna end.</i>

400
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,525
So, what about
this one?

401
00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:48,029
How does
this one work?

402
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,517
Many years ago, my old man
and I, came across a small town

403
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:53,532
not unlike this one
y'all got here.

404
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:55,613
<i> Thing had been there</i>
<i> for a couple of days.</i>

405
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:57,661
<i> Nearly the whole town</i>
<i> had gotten killed.</i>

406
00:27:57,663 --> 00:28:00,925
<i> It was unusual because demons</i>
<i> normally aren't responsible</i>

407
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:02,301
<i>for those type of body counts.</i>

408
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:04,733
They're more partial
to personal torment.

409
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:06,141
But this thing was
different.

410
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,892
See, the way it transfigured
was by being killed.

411
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:11,037
The moment you killed it,
it became you.

412
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,581
Which, needless to say,
complicated things.

413
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,373
<i> So anyway,</i>
<i> me and my dad sat there</i>

414
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,645
<i> and explained</i>
<i> this to the townfolks,</i>

415
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:21,405
<i> just like I'm explaining it</i>
<i> to you now.</i>

416
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:23,069
<i> Course, they believed us</i>
<i> straight on,</i>

417
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:25,277
<i> having seen the carnage</i>
<i> themselves.</i>

418
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,197
Okay. So how'd you kill it?

419
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:29,533
<i> See, my old man</i>
<i> had the brave idea.</i>

420
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,228
<i> He sacrificed himself.</i>

421
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,621
<i> He drank a poison,</i>
<i> and then he killed it.</i>

422
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:36,988
<i> So the demon</i>
<i> had no place to go.</i>

423
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,572
<i> And I could trap it.</i>

424
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,661
Well, I'm so sorry.

425
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:48,221
I lost my daddy
to prostate cancer.

426
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:51,388
That's a shame.
So how did you lose the demon?

427
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,181
I'm getting to it.
It's complicated.

428
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:55,357
I tried to hang onto it
for 30 years.

429
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,141
It just had a funny way
of slipping out of my hands.

430
00:28:58,143 --> 00:28:59,965
You see, the thing has
a life of its own.

431
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,725
It doesn't wanna stay
in that box.

432
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:04,029
It's got a way of influencing
the world around it.

433
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:06,589
Okay. How did you lose it,
Mr. woodley?

434
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:08,349
You can't kill the thing.
All you can do

435
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:10,301
is put it where no one
will ever get to it.

436
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:12,349
So I rented a plane,
came down here.

437
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,885
Was gonna drop it here
in the bayou.

438
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,773
Engine trouble,

439
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,885
fire starts,
i gotta bail out.

440
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:19,901
Plane just scatters itself
all around town.

441
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:22,429
I remember investigating
that crash.

442
00:29:22,431 --> 00:29:24,380
Good for you.
Anyhow,

443
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:27,964
middle of the bayou ain't
a bad place to hide the thing.

444
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,396
So I just stuck around town
for a while,

445
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,509
just in case somebody
stumbled upon it.

446
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:34,653
Which is good,
because that's what happened.

447
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,213
Well,

448
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,997
some nice trees they
have here.

449
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:47,068
Seem to have forgotten
my wallet. Heh, heh.

450
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,237
What?

451
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:53,309
Fine.
This one's on me.

452
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:55,549
Thank you very much.

453
00:29:55,551 --> 00:29:58,844
So let's just say
any part of that is true.

454
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:02,141
You got a plan?
I suggest you find the man

455
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:04,061
that killed the last
of those three murderers.

456
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:06,268
Hold a town meeting
with everyone except him,

457
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,221
tell them what happened
and maybe

458
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,101
we can work together on this.
You wanna tell an entire town

459
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:13,405
there's a body-hopping demon
on the loose?

460
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:14,621
Something like that.

461
00:30:14,623 --> 00:30:16,157
That will only
exacerbate things.

462
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,333
Even if they believe you,
which I highly doubt,

463
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:21,724
this town is ultra-Christian.
They're gonna go into a panic.

464
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:24,445
Chief Dunham, is there
an emergency system

465
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,036
at the local school so we
can keep the children safe?

466
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,341
Well, now, agent Pierce,
you're gonna have to pardon me,

467
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:32,157
but I think you spent a little
too much time in Washington.

468
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,204
This here's chicory creek,
Mississippi.

469
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:37,021
We just got our first stoplight
about six months ago. Heh, heh.

470
00:30:37,023 --> 00:30:39,837
I'm sorry,
but this plan is ridiculous.

471
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,469
I'm not gonna let you
get this town

472
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:43,452
into a frenzy
just on your word alone.

473
00:30:43,454 --> 00:30:46,109
Fine. I'll wait for you
to wise up then.

474
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:49,181
Chief, how can I find the man
who killed the last murderer?

475
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,653
What are you gonna do
when you find him?

476
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:52,797
Oh, I'll sit him down
for a quiet little chat.

477
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,333
If we help you,
then I'm coming.

478
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,188
As much as I'd love
to spend some time

479
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,917
with a lovely lady
like yourself,

480
00:30:57,918 --> 00:31:00,573
I work alone.
We're gonna do this my way,

481
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:03,037
or you can take a seat
back in that cell.

482
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,788
Your choice.
All right, then.

483
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,645
And if you make one
false move,

484
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:10,588
I will not hesitate
to shoot you myself.

485
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,269
Fair enough.
Let's get my shit and get going.

486
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:17,564
Now. Now, let's see
what we got in here.

487
00:31:17,566 --> 00:31:20,957
So one ruger.

488
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,124
Three-five-seven Magnum...

489
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:28,605
And holster
with twelve rubber bullets.

490
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:33,180
I like this here, one vaporizer.

491
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:37,917
One small-animal trap.

492
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,061
Careful with that.

493
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,901
South American bola balls.

494
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:49,725
And last but not least,

495
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:52,765
one whip with two...

496
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,621
Shrunken heads.

497
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,788
Oh, shit, just put down "whip."
One whip.

498
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:03,261
What?

499
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,821
- All right. Pull over.
- This should be it.

500
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:12,317
The house of the man
who shot the last murderer.

501
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,516
One Jeremy ruckner.

502
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:32,477
What, do you live in your car?
Uh-huh.

503
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:35,101
Course you do.

504
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:38,237
What on earth is that?
It's my net gun.

505
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,093
She's my pride and joy.

506
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:42,396
How does she work?

507
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:44,957
Well, it's
a pressurized release.

508
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,517
The nets fly out,
they're weighted at the ends.

509
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,332
They knock the victim off
its feet, don't kill it.

510
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,900
Let me see.

511
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:56,956
Jeez. Just a little heavier
than it looks.

512
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,845
Uh-huh.

513
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:01,213
Okay. That should be
the house there.

514
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:03,837
How does he know where he
lives if he's possessed?

515
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:05,277
Instinct.

516
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,772
Hasn't been any murders
for a while.

517
00:33:07,774 --> 00:33:10,940
Reckon he's taking a break.
Seen him do it before.

518
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:16,252
Somebody's coming.

519
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:30,748
Hey, you shouldn't
even have that thing on you.

520
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,340
Oh, I'll be holding onto it,
thank you very much.

521
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:36,060
You shoot him with that,
you're gonna regret it.

522
00:33:36,062 --> 00:33:38,045
Trust me on that.

523
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,916
Wait here.

524
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,869
Howdy.

525
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:18,396
Oh, my god.

526
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:20,764
Yeah. It can be a dirty job,
that's for sure.

527
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:24,508
Oh, my god. It's horrible.

528
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,301
Takes some getting
used to.

529
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:29,308
Who the fuck are you?
It can talk?

530
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,540
Uh, no. No. He's not
supposed to do that.

531
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,268
Unhand me.

532
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,188
Shit.
What?

533
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,173
What's the matter?

534
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:40,765
It's not him.
What do you mean it's not him?

535
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,325
Well, it's him,
but he ain't possessed.

536
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:44,957
Drunk as piss
by the smell of him,

537
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,644
but he ain't possessed.
Who the fuck are you?

538
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:50,076
Sorry, sir. Well,

539
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:52,060
we seem to have made
some kind of mistake.

540
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:54,844
I'm sorry, buddy.
Mistake?

541
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,860
You nearly broke
my arms.

542
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,941
This is complete bullshit,
isn't it?

543
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:01,117
No, it's not bullshit.
He's not the guy

544
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,741
who did the last shooting.
The hell I ain't.

545
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:06,781
Three days ago I put
that crazy bastard down

546
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:08,445
with that gun right
up there.

547
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:11,164
I'm the best shot
in Mississippi.

548
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,116
Okay, so? He said he shot him.

549
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:15,548
Okay. Tell me exactly
what happened.

550
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,524
Well, ain't you heard?
I shot the fucker.

551
00:35:18,526 --> 00:35:20,125
I got him right
in the gut.

552
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:22,876
Did anybody do anything else
to his body after you shot him?

553
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:25,564
Well, yeah, Glen prichard ran up
and finished him off,

554
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:28,476
but I'm the one who put him down
and stopped the killing.

555
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:30,748
You ask anybody.
So, what happened to prichard?

556
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,668
Where'd he go?
He ran off.

557
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,220
After he done it, he just
looked at us and took off.

558
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:38,461
Probably couldn't stand
the sight of the blood.

559
00:35:38,463 --> 00:35:40,989
Pussy.
All right. We're done here.

560
00:35:40,991 --> 00:35:43,261
This does not prove
anything.

561
00:35:43,263 --> 00:35:44,508
Uh-huh.

562
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,876
Hey, wait a minute.
Get up.

563
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,573
Hey, you haven't
told me

564
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:51,676
why you shot me
with that damn net.

565
00:35:51,678 --> 00:35:53,565
- All right.
- Just was a bad dream.

566
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:56,157
You just go back to bed, now,
come on.

567
00:35:57,245 --> 00:36:00,029
Merry Christmas.

568
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:08,637
Wow, do you really
have to do that in the car?

569
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,093
Didn't have enough ribs
for lunch?

570
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:27,964
No, thank you.

571
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:36,796
Shit.

572
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:47,581
Damn it.

573
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,917
Car's overheating.
Happens all the time.

574
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,388
I knew I should've
never trusted you.

575
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,788
We need to get to the station.
Can you shut up?

576
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,540
Excuse me? You should be
kissing my ass right now.

577
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,364
I could've left you in
that cell to rot.

578
00:36:58,366 --> 00:36:59,517
Shh.

579
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,108
Don't "shush" me.
Quiet.

580
00:37:05,437 --> 00:37:07,932
I just saw something.

581
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:14,396
I don't see--

582
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,252
something's watching us
from the woods.

583
00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:18,332
I don't see anything.
Shh.

584
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:20,221
Yeah. Right there.

585
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:25,468
Get in the car.
Don't say a word.

586
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,420
Stay quiet.

587
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,236
Get back in the car.

588
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,852
Is this for real?

589
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,436
Okay.

590
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:04,316
Am I interrupting something?

591
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:21,852
Oh, shit.

592
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:31,228
Rubber bullets.
Works when you're in a jam.

593
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,220
I-- i--

594
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,812
I just--
breathe, try not to talk.

595
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,397
So I say we set
that town meeting

596
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:40,892
around 6 P.M. tomorrow.
Sound good to you?

597
00:40:56,317 --> 00:40:58,204
Hi, y'all. Welcome.

598
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,084
Good evening,
um, Mrs. kravitz.

599
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:03,836
Maybe you could help? Do you
have a first-aid kit here?

600
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,140
Yes, I have something
here somewhere.

601
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:09,500
That's terrific. We also need
two rooms for the evening.

602
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:13,756
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
but I only have one room left.

603
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:16,092
I'm afraid you'll
have to share.

604
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:24,124
You need some help?

605
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:27,836
No, I was always pretty good
at do-it-yourself surgery.

606
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:37,660
Thank you
for what you did.

607
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,444
Don't thank me.
Thank him.

608
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:42,140
I don't understand.

609
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:44,668
When I got to you, I was pretty
sure he'd already killed you.

610
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,644
I've never seen it react that
way, the way he looked at you.

611
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:49,437
I was relieved to see
you were alive

612
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:50,844
until I realized
what that meant.

613
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:54,396
It wants me to kill it.
Yeah. It appears so.

614
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:56,412
Why?
It likes you.

615
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:59,580
Maybe it likes your body,
maybe it likes your soul.

616
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:02,844
He collects souls,
makes him more powerful.

617
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:04,892
The eyes, his eyes...

618
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:07,356
Yeah. I know.

619
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,652
Creepy as hell, right?
No, no. It--

620
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:14,364
in his eyes, I saw something.

621
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,308
There were dark clouds,
lightning.

622
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,124
There were people screaming.

623
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:22,812
It was terrible.

624
00:42:22,814 --> 00:42:24,348
I've never been so afraid.

625
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,388
Now, that's unexpected.

626
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:32,444
Here, let me help you.

627
00:42:32,446 --> 00:42:34,588
Let me help you.

628
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:43,740
So how long
have you been doing this?

629
00:42:43,742 --> 00:42:45,180
Oh, um...

630
00:42:45,182 --> 00:42:48,444
Pretty much
as long as I remember.

631
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,908
It was kind
of a family business.

632
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,892
Christmas must've been fun.
Heh.

633
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:57,212
Thanks
for the warning.

634
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:10,876
So, uh,

635
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:13,884
is there any way
to get the demon

636
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:15,612
without hurting anyone?

637
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,204
Well, I think you're getting
ahead of yourself.

638
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:24,956
If we don't catch
the thing then, uh,

639
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:29,020
all this thinking
will be for nothing.

640
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:34,076
Okay. Well...

641
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:39,580
You're all set.

642
00:43:41,725 --> 00:43:43,323
Thank you.

643
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:49,372
Uh, I'll just change here if
you don't mind turning around.

644
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:51,644
Okay. Sure. No problem.

645
00:44:14,749 --> 00:44:18,012
Look, I'm just
gonna go outside.

646
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:19,388
Where?

647
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,780
I'm gonna sleep in the car.
It's--

648
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:24,412
it's pretty cozy actually.

649
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:27,260
There's plenty of space on
the floor, you don't have to--

650
00:44:35,261 --> 00:44:36,828
hey, Nelson.

651
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,524
Sorry to wake you, buddy.

652
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:40,732
Yeah. Can you run
a lineage check

653
00:44:40,734 --> 00:44:42,843
for me on an Evelyn Pierce?

654
00:44:42,845 --> 00:44:44,636
Yeah. Cross reference
with your list,

655
00:44:44,638 --> 00:44:47,068
see if anything in
that family tree pops up.

656
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,532
I gotta go. Get back to me
as soon as you can, all right?

657
00:45:07,197 --> 00:45:08,636
Trouble sleeping?

658
00:45:11,357 --> 00:45:15,356
I spent my childhood here.
Figured I would pay a visit.

659
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:17,916
Looks like that was
a nice farm a ways back.

660
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:20,796
Why was it abandoned?

661
00:45:20,797 --> 00:45:24,188
Well, supposedly,

662
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,596
it's cursed.

663
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,972
And why is that?

664
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,116
My parents never
told me much.

665
00:45:29,118 --> 00:45:34,044
From what I hear, there
was an easter celebration

666
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:36,028
and I fell in the pool.

667
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,396
I hit my head on the edge
as I went in.

668
00:45:38,398 --> 00:45:40,860
I think it was a few minutes
before anyone found me.

669
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:42,332
I was completely blue.

670
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:46,076
My mother, she grabbed me, and
she carried me into the house

671
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:47,900
and when
she brought me back,

672
00:45:47,902 --> 00:45:51,228
I was totally fine
like nothing had happened.

673
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,516
I don't remember any of it,
but I do know what people say.

674
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:57,371
It's like she brought me
back from the dead.

675
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:58,812
Next thing
i do remember

676
00:45:58,814 --> 00:46:01,596
is that people were throwing
rocks into our window

677
00:46:01,598 --> 00:46:04,796
and we just packed up, and we
left pretty quickly after that.

678
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:07,100
Well, Evelyn, I'm sorry
to hear all that.

679
00:46:07,102 --> 00:46:09,243
Everyone's got
their sob story, right?

680
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:10,428
You know what I think?

681
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,668
Now is an appropriate time
as any to tell you.

682
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,203
I was trying to figure out

683
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,796
why our black-eyed
friend up there liked you.

684
00:46:16,798 --> 00:46:18,460
What you saw in
his eyes,

685
00:46:18,462 --> 00:46:20,380
the circumstances
of your family's departure

686
00:46:20,382 --> 00:46:21,723
from chicory creek,

687
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:24,188
it all points at one thing.
What is that?

688
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,236
Well, there's
a slim chance

689
00:46:26,238 --> 00:46:28,347
that your ancestors were,
and you are--

690
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:31,132
how do I put this?
Um, uh... ahem.

691
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:33,468
Well, look, there
are demons, right?

692
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,708
And at the other end
of the spectrum,

693
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,716
there are beings that
descended from the light.

694
00:46:38,718 --> 00:46:40,892
Are we talking about
fucking angels now?

695
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:43,996
Well, you said it.
I know. Listen.

696
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:46,044
Okay. Let's call
them angels.

697
00:46:46,046 --> 00:46:47,964
Well, many,
many years ago,

698
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:49,436
according to the Bible
and stuff,

699
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:52,251
these angels descended to earth,
they mated with humans.

700
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:55,964
They gave rise
to this divine bloodline.

701
00:46:55,966 --> 00:46:57,564
And you're saying
I'm one of them.

702
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:59,100
What you saw in his eyes,

703
00:46:59,102 --> 00:47:01,532
your mother had that ability,
birthmarks on your back--

704
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:03,836
how did you see those?
You turned around? Did you--?

705
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:06,364
There was just like
a reflection or something.

706
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:09,052
I am the furthest from angelic.
Just--

707
00:47:09,054 --> 00:47:11,964
listen to me,
if I'm right,

708
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:14,364
the stakes
just got a whole lot higher.

709
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:15,580
And why is that?

710
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,084
Because there's a dark place,

711
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:19,164
another plane,
existing next to ours.

712
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:21,147
It's full of dark things,
bad things.

713
00:47:21,149 --> 00:47:23,163
What does that have to do
with me? With my family?

714
00:47:23,165 --> 00:47:25,980
If you are from that divine
bloodline I told you about,

715
00:47:25,982 --> 00:47:28,219
you have the ability
to connect with those worlds.

716
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:33,308
And if the thing consumes your
soul, it will use your body.

717
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,836
And he'll call up
his little demon buddies,

718
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:37,276
thousands of them.

719
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:40,156
And then chicory creek
literally will be hell on earth.

720
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,164
Why does it need me?
Aren't there others like me?

721
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:44,956
I'm not too sure
there are any.

722
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:48,027
Listen,
i may be wrong,

723
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:51,419
but you'd better keep your
finger off that trigger.

724
00:47:58,653 --> 00:48:01,084
Well, all right now,
great to see you too.

725
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:04,188
Hey, good to see you.
Hey, looking good.

726
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,684
Come in, have a seat.
That's not what I'm saying.

727
00:48:06,685 --> 00:48:10,492
I'm just saying I think we
should have a team on standby.

728
00:48:10,494 --> 00:48:13,756
Please. Please, look,
I'm really close here. Trust me.

729
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,060
Just give me a chance.

730
00:48:17,084 --> 00:48:20,604
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

731
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,380
Everything okay?
Yeah. It's good.

732
00:48:24,382 --> 00:48:27,483
Hey, hey, come on in.
Hey, good to see you.

733
00:48:27,485 --> 00:48:31,356
Oh, shit. Uh...

734
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,619
I know, father, I know.
What is this all about?

735
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,508
It's all gonna be
explained in a minute.

736
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,851
Now, come on, Marty.

737
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:40,635
My congregation
are truly worried.

738
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:41,660
Okay?

739
00:48:41,662 --> 00:48:44,604
Now, I saw Evelyn Pierce
in your office.

740
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,612
She is not to be trusted.

741
00:48:47,613 --> 00:48:49,788
All right.

742
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,955
Why don't you
just take a seat

743
00:48:52,957 --> 00:48:54,971
for your own sake.

744
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:05,308
Ladies and gentlemen, I need
to get your attention, please.

745
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,747
Speak up, Dunham.

746
00:49:06,749 --> 00:49:10,556
I'm gonna please ask
that you don't shout.

747
00:49:10,558 --> 00:49:13,404
Now, I know y'all
got a lot of questions,

748
00:49:13,406 --> 00:49:15,483
and we're gonna
take those questions

749
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,171
just as soon
as this meeting's done.

750
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:19,835
In the meantime,

751
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:23,323
I'm gonna have to ask
that you all remain calm.

752
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:28,092
Now, it has come
to my attention

753
00:49:28,094 --> 00:49:31,388
that the string of murders
earlier this week were--

754
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,972
are connected.

755
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:36,571
- What?
- What do you mean?

756
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,876
- How's that possible?
- What's next?

757
00:49:38,878 --> 00:49:41,020
Quiet, now.
Calm down, now.

758
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,659
It appears...

759
00:49:45,661 --> 00:49:48,924
Some kind of
supernatural thing afoot.

760
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:50,684
What the fuck?

761
00:49:50,686 --> 00:49:53,020
Eunice, that is not helping.
Now you shut up.

762
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:57,052
Now, sit down.
Y'all be quiet.

763
00:49:57,054 --> 00:50:00,059
Y'all know we got
FBI working on this.

764
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:01,627
This guy's coming in...
Oh, shit.

765
00:50:01,629 --> 00:50:04,059
...let's respect--
okay. Good evening, folks.

766
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:06,875
I'm jebediah
woodley.

767
00:50:06,877 --> 00:50:09,180
That's right.

768
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:11,996
I wanna talk to you
a little bit

769
00:50:11,997 --> 00:50:14,588
about what's happened
in town this past week.

770
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,148
I know you're all frightened,
as you should be,

771
00:50:17,149 --> 00:50:20,988
but if you just cooperate and
listen to what I got to say,

772
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:22,491
everybody's
gonna be fine.

773
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:24,859
Ahem. Well, most
of you are gonna be fine.

774
00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:26,108
Most of us?

775
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,739
Well, look. Look,
just calm down now.

776
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:29,211
I'm gonna explain it
to you.

777
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:31,964
I'm gonna explain what
happened. See, there's--

778
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:34,267
well, just hear me
out now.

779
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:36,123
We'll get a chance
to talk about this later.

780
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,595
I know you're
not gonna believe

781
00:50:37,597 --> 00:50:40,027
some of the things
I'm about to say.

782
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:42,876
Some of you, well--
let me finish up.

783
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:44,604
I'll explain it to you.

784
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:46,331
There's something going on
in this town,

785
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,411
and it's kind of scary,

786
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,012
but some of you will
have a problem

787
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,059
believing what I'm
about to say now,

788
00:50:52,061 --> 00:50:53,819
but I gotta tell
you something.

789
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:56,316
Well, it's kind
of a strange story.

790
00:50:57,949 --> 00:50:59,548
Uh...

791
00:51:03,997 --> 00:51:07,292
Oh, shit.

792
00:51:07,294 --> 00:51:09,627
Everybody,
evacuate the premises.

793
00:51:29,244 --> 00:51:31,324
Don't shoot it.

794
00:51:43,677 --> 00:51:45,723
Let me shoot it.

795
00:51:48,444 --> 00:51:50,715
For Pete's sake.

796
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,379
Hold still now.

797
00:52:48,828 --> 00:52:51,035
Shit.

798
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:57,660
What do we do now?

799
00:53:57,661 --> 00:53:58,811
Call for backup.

800
00:53:58,813 --> 00:54:01,595
This was the backup.
Shut your mouth, Dunham.

801
00:54:01,597 --> 00:54:04,827
He was trying his best.
They didn't listen to him.

802
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:06,267
If your men knew
how to follow orders,

803
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:07,835
we wouldn't be
in this mess.

804
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:09,915
I need your car now.

805
00:54:17,117 --> 00:54:18,523
All right.

806
00:54:18,525 --> 00:54:20,475
Where are you going?
I'll do this on my own.

807
00:54:20,477 --> 00:54:22,620
You need us.
Like hell I do.

808
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,243
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna find it.

809
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:40,060
Four, five, six,

810
00:54:40,062 --> 00:54:43,931
seven, eight, nine, ten.

811
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:47,388
Ready or not, here I come.

812
00:54:58,172 --> 00:54:59,995
You suck at this game.

813
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:02,427
You know I only play
so that you'll leave me alone.

814
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:04,027
When's daddy coming home?

815
00:55:04,029 --> 00:55:05,372
I told you, I don't know.

816
00:55:05,374 --> 00:55:07,548
He's probably still down
at the town hall.

817
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,411
Who's that?

818
00:55:12,413 --> 00:55:15,324
Who's who?
The man outside.

819
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:19,835
Get away
from the window, jezz.

820
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:36,379
Stay back.

821
00:55:43,996 --> 00:55:45,723
Help.

822
00:55:47,517 --> 00:55:49,019
Help.

823
00:56:00,028 --> 00:56:01,627
We need to find him.

824
00:56:01,629 --> 00:56:04,603
Look, I've been thinking this
over. Maybe he was right.

825
00:56:04,605 --> 00:56:07,164
About what?
About me.

826
00:56:07,165 --> 00:56:09,787
Maybe it was my fault.
Maybe I shouldn't even be here.

827
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:12,539
Oh, come on, don't be a coward.
I got a heart condition.

828
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:14,492
Snap out of it.
Chief Dunham,

829
00:56:14,493 --> 00:56:16,091
regardless
of what jebediah says,

830
00:56:16,093 --> 00:56:19,196
the fact remains, we need
all the help we can get.

831
00:56:19,198 --> 00:56:23,195
I understand if you feel guilty
about the deaths of your men,

832
00:56:23,197 --> 00:56:25,819
but you don't avenge them
by running away.

833
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:27,580
You stand
and you fight.

834
00:56:27,582 --> 00:56:30,555
Okay? You stand here, and you
fight with me, chief Dunham.

835
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:32,763
You defend this town.

836
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:37,915
Chief.

837
00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:39,259
Chief.

838
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:41,851
Chief Dunham, hey!

839
00:56:44,604 --> 00:56:46,299
Wow.

840
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,875
What's going on here?

841
00:57:35,004 --> 00:57:37,691
You.

842
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,108
Yeah.

843
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:44,763
Why did you bring
this evil to this town?

844
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:46,203
Excuse me?

845
00:57:46,205 --> 00:57:48,731
I do not know what your designs
are in chicory creek,

846
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:51,227
but I do know
that Evelyn Pierce,

847
00:57:51,229 --> 00:57:52,923
like her mother
before her,

848
00:57:52,925 --> 00:57:56,219
had the blood of Satan
flowing in her veins.

849
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:59,803
And you are in league with her,
are you not?

850
00:57:59,805 --> 00:58:01,595
You got this wrong.

851
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:04,091
The important thing is now
you calm these people down.

852
00:58:04,093 --> 00:58:06,843
Why, pray tell,
should we believe you?

853
00:58:06,845 --> 00:58:10,107
How are we to know
that you are not in cahoots

854
00:58:10,109 --> 00:58:13,083
with this hell spawn
that is attacking this town?

855
00:58:13,085 --> 00:58:16,763
You better calm down, padre.
I will do no such thing.

856
00:58:16,765 --> 00:58:20,251
I see it now.
You are Lucifer's mouthpiece,

857
00:58:20,253 --> 00:58:22,971
and Evelyn Pierce
is his concubine.

858
00:58:22,973 --> 00:58:24,539
Aren't you taking
this a bit far?

859
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:25,819
Be gone.

860
00:58:25,821 --> 00:58:28,763
Be gone, hell spawn.
Calm down.

861
00:58:28,765 --> 00:58:30,139
Be gone.
That's rude.

862
00:58:30,141 --> 00:58:31,483
I'd rather
you not do that.

863
00:58:31,485 --> 00:58:33,915
The power of Christ
compels you.

864
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:35,675
I'm pretty sure
that's from<i> the exorcist.</i>

865
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:37,691
Be gone, hell spawn.

866
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:40,635
And tell
your lord Lucifer not--

867
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:43,899
oh, no.

868
00:58:46,205 --> 00:58:49,531
Calm down, y'all.
Rubber bullets.

869
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:53,723
Padre, you all right
there, padre?

870
00:58:53,725 --> 00:58:55,643
You all right?
Okay.

871
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:58,331
He'll be okay.
He'll be fine.

872
00:59:00,156 --> 00:59:01,979
Merry Christmas.

873
00:59:14,524 --> 00:59:16,763
What do you want?
I wanna help you.

874
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:18,555
You've helped plenty.
I got it from here.

875
00:59:18,557 --> 00:59:21,531
We're running out of time. Plus,
I'm the one it wants, right?

876
00:59:21,533 --> 00:59:23,035
So don't
you want me around?

877
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,835
That's exactly why
i don't want you around.

878
00:59:31,996 --> 00:59:33,563
Pastor.

879
00:59:33,565 --> 00:59:35,643
Pastor Erikson.

880
00:59:35,644 --> 00:59:37,147
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

881
00:59:37,149 --> 00:59:40,059
Pastor, he's-- well,
he's indisposed right now.

882
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:43,067
Uh-uh. I gotta see the pastor.
My girl, she's gone mad.

883
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:45,083
I don't know what to do.
What's your name?

884
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:46,043
Emmett.

885
00:59:46,045 --> 00:59:47,803
Emmett, tell me
what happened now.

886
00:59:47,805 --> 00:59:50,779
Wait a minute, you're the guy
from the town-hall meeting.

887
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:52,923
What's going on? Is something
making people sick?

888
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:54,523
Is my little girl sick?
Emmett,

889
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:56,411
just tell me
exactly what happened.

890
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:59,259
I got home
about an hour ago.

891
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:00,955
There was a man
outside on the front lawn

892
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:02,875
with a bullet wound
in his head.

893
01:00:02,877 --> 01:00:05,723
And I went inside,
and my little one,

894
01:00:05,725 --> 01:00:07,419
my girl, she's got
a knife to her.

895
01:00:07,421 --> 01:00:10,619
So I tell her to run,
and then she looks at me,

896
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:12,507
and her eyes were
all black. My girl--

897
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,131
lead me to her.
Come on. Let's go.

898
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:17,403
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Let's go.

899
01:00:27,131 --> 01:00:28,859
She's down there.

900
01:00:30,716 --> 01:00:32,859
No other exit
to that basement, right?

901
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:34,363
No, sir.
All right.

902
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:35,515
How will we do this?

903
01:00:35,517 --> 01:00:36,987
Let me think
for a second here.

904
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:39,227
If she's possessed,
she in a lot of pain?

905
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:41,051
That's right.
She sure is.

906
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:43,579
There's gotta be a way I can
help. How can I help her?

907
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:45,371
There is a way to do that.
How?

908
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:49,210
The only way is by killing her.
What? What'd you say to me?

909
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,547
You're gonna be putting her
out of a lot of misery.

910
01:00:51,549 --> 01:00:53,499
I can't.

911
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:54,970
I can't kill my little girl.

912
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:57,083
That ain't your little girl
down there no more.

913
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:58,491
I don't understand.

914
01:00:58,493 --> 01:01:00,187
Wouldn't it just
be the same problems

915
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,467
but inside of me now?

916
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:03,067
What we're gonna do
is make poison,

917
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:05,595
you drink it, you go
down there, do the deed,

918
01:01:05,597 --> 01:01:08,219
wait to die, you will
be with your girl.

919
01:01:08,221 --> 01:01:11,003
Wouldn't want her
to be alone, would you?

920
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:12,315
I can't.

921
01:01:12,317 --> 01:01:14,459
All right. I'll do it.
No.

922
01:01:14,461 --> 01:01:15,963
What--?

923
01:01:15,965 --> 01:01:17,435
What's she going
through right now?

924
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:19,195
She is screaming,
she's down there.

925
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:21,498
She's burning up, waiting
for the whole thing to end.

926
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,059
Oh, Jesus. There's
gotta be another way.

927
01:01:24,061 --> 01:01:26,650
I can't kill my daughter,
you gotta understand that.

928
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:28,315
You listen to me.

929
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,587
You wanna honor
your little girl,

930
01:01:30,589 --> 01:01:33,883
better put her out
of her misery.

931
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:39,355
All right.

932
01:01:39,357 --> 01:01:40,987
I'll do it.

933
01:01:43,164 --> 01:01:45,979
Come on, Evelyn,
let's make this poison now.

934
01:01:51,228 --> 01:01:55,323
How long will I have to bear it?
Couple of minutes, tops.

935
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,827
Jesus, no.

936
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:03,835
It's okay. It's okay.

937
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:09,339
Come on. You ready?

938
01:02:10,715 --> 01:02:12,699
So she'll
be at rest?

939
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:15,291
Once it's inside you,
it's out of her.

940
01:02:15,293 --> 01:02:16,795
What's it gonna
be like for me?

941
01:02:16,797 --> 01:02:20,539
Well, I'd be lying if I said
it was gonna be pleasant.

942
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,555
Here.

943
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,547
So...

944
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:30,970
I take this, and i--

945
01:02:30,972 --> 01:02:32,282
kill it.

946
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:38,171
All right.

947
01:02:38,173 --> 01:02:41,339
I know what I have to do.
Drink it while it's hot now.

948
01:02:42,268 --> 01:02:44,155
All right.

949
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,419
Thanks.

950
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:53,147
Sure.

951
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:17,083
Everybody get down
on the ground.

952
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,811
What the hell is going on?

953
01:03:18,813 --> 01:03:20,731
I'm sorry. I thought
they'd give me more time.

954
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:22,587
You damn fool.
Shut your mouth.

955
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:26,042
Guys,
I'm not doing too good.

956
01:03:26,044 --> 01:03:28,730
Deacon Shepherd, look,
you're making a huge mistake.

957
01:03:28,732 --> 01:03:30,490
It's nice to see
you too, Evelyn.

958
01:03:30,492 --> 01:03:33,179
Give us a few more minutes.
Let us finish what we're doing.

959
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,131
Then you can take over
the operation.

960
01:03:35,133 --> 01:03:37,883
Is that an order?

961
01:03:39,325 --> 01:03:41,883
Sir, something's
wrong with this one.

962
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:46,587
What have you done to this man?

963
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:49,115
Drift leaf, mainly.

964
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,483
It's a poison.

965
01:03:51,485 --> 01:03:53,499
You poisoned this man?

966
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,570
Get him the hell
out of here.

967
01:03:56,572 --> 01:04:00,891
Wait. What exactly
is your role in this?

968
01:04:00,893 --> 01:04:02,107
Go to hell.

969
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:05,371
Got it. Hard case.
Put him in the Van.

970
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:10,651
As for you, you go outside.
I'll talk to you later.

971
01:04:10,653 --> 01:04:13,531
Wait. You have no idea--
I'll deal with you later.

972
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:22,715
Scour these premises.

973
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:26,619
Jebediah.

974
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:28,059
Jebediah, i--
don't.

975
01:04:28,061 --> 01:04:29,883
They would've come
even if I hadn't called.

976
01:04:29,885 --> 01:04:31,451
What do they know?

977
01:04:31,453 --> 01:04:34,010
I told them everything. I didn't
think they would believe me.

978
01:04:34,012 --> 01:04:36,059
We'll deal with
this later. Get ready.

979
01:04:40,348 --> 01:04:42,523
Check the door.

980
01:05:15,035 --> 01:05:16,987
Turn around right now.
Un-cuff him.

981
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:18,811
Don't do this.

982
01:05:18,813 --> 01:05:21,179
Un-cuff him right now.

983
01:05:36,636 --> 01:05:38,586
Hold it.
You idiot.

984
01:05:38,588 --> 01:05:41,306
We have to go now. Now.

985
01:05:42,908 --> 01:05:44,794
Get in the damn car.

986
01:06:30,204 --> 01:06:31,675
You're fucking dead.

987
01:06:31,677 --> 01:06:33,210
She's got the gun, smartass.

988
01:06:33,212 --> 01:06:36,347
What was that?
It was exactly what I told you.

989
01:06:36,348 --> 01:06:37,883
No, that can't be.

990
01:06:37,885 --> 01:06:39,835
There must be some kind of--
there isn't.

991
01:06:39,836 --> 01:06:41,819
We need you
to cooperate with us now.

992
01:06:41,821 --> 01:06:43,418
You wouldn't touch me.

993
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,051
Without my testimony,

994
01:06:45,053 --> 01:06:47,739
you're both gonna be on the hook
for that bloodbath there.

995
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:49,659
Testimony? I don't
think you understand

996
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:51,067
the time frame
we're on here.

997
01:06:51,069 --> 01:06:54,107
I have been shot.
I'm wounded.

998
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:56,219
First we're gonna get me
medical attention.

999
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:59,226
Then we'll talk about
what happened back there.

1000
01:07:01,052 --> 01:07:02,683
Please, okay, okay.

1001
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,307
What happened
while we were outside?

1002
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:07,514
The little girl,

1003
01:07:07,516 --> 01:07:09,403
she came out
of the back room.

1004
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:11,419
She-- she attacked--

1005
01:07:12,893 --> 01:07:14,490
she killed three of my men.

1006
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:17,947
We fired on her.

1007
01:07:17,949 --> 01:07:20,506
And then one
of my guys fired on me,

1008
01:07:20,508 --> 01:07:21,754
clipped me
in the shoulder. Ow!

1009
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:23,515
Then what happened?

1010
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:27,002
I fired on him,
and then I ran.

1011
01:07:28,604 --> 01:07:30,842
Fuck you both.
You'd have run too.

1012
01:07:30,844 --> 01:07:32,122
Okay.
Did you hit him?

1013
01:07:32,124 --> 01:07:35,546
Yeah. Yes,
but it wasn't a kill-shot.

1014
01:07:35,548 --> 01:07:38,138
Where'd you hit him?
Lower abdomen.

1015
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,154
All right. Cuff him now.

1016
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,843
What? What is this?
Wait a minute.

1017
01:07:42,844 --> 01:07:46,458
What the fuck are you doing?
I am with you, okay?

1018
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,346
You're both
fucking crazy.

1019
01:07:48,348 --> 01:07:54,106
Clearly, there's something
very unnatural going on here.

1020
01:07:54,108 --> 01:07:56,443
Why don't we get in the car,
drive back,

1021
01:07:56,445 --> 01:07:58,427
I'll explain everything,
all will be forgiven.

1022
01:07:58,429 --> 01:07:59,962
I don't think
we have time for that.

1023
01:07:59,964 --> 01:08:02,682
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1024
01:08:02,684 --> 01:08:05,179
Ahh!

1025
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:28,058
I'll do it.
I'll fucking do it.

1026
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:57,275
Agent Pierce.

1027
01:09:11,611 --> 01:09:13,243
I'm sorry, jebediah.

1028
01:09:13,245 --> 01:09:15,386
Trust me,
if it weren't for me,

1029
01:09:15,388 --> 01:09:17,179
those men back there
would still be alive.

1030
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,163
Well,
you should've told me.

1031
01:09:19,165 --> 01:09:21,179
Let's just be clear
with each other from now on.

1032
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:24,090
What are we
gonna do with him?

1033
01:09:24,092 --> 01:09:28,315
Well, we're just gonna find
a suitable place and end this.

1034
01:09:28,317 --> 01:09:29,946
And who's
gonna kill it?

1035
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:33,115
Yeah. Well, I'm just gonna
have to figure something out.

1036
01:09:48,924 --> 01:09:51,738
It doesn't have to be like this.

1037
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,786
We can keep going.
We can find another way.

1038
01:09:53,788 --> 01:09:57,755
There is no other way. Someone
has to die. That's the rules.

1039
01:09:57,756 --> 01:10:00,826
Yeah, but you're--
you're important. You're--

1040
01:10:00,828 --> 01:10:03,450
why am I important?

1041
01:10:03,452 --> 01:10:05,018
Because I kill demons?

1042
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:06,842
Should you wanna die
instead of me?

1043
01:10:06,844 --> 01:10:10,299
Would I like for this
to be someone else?

1044
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:12,475
You bet your ass.

1045
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:14,843
But you're different.

1046
01:10:14,845 --> 01:10:18,202
You got that power inside of you
that you have to harness.

1047
01:10:18,204 --> 01:10:19,770
You're important.

1048
01:10:19,772 --> 01:10:22,779
Hell of a lot more important
than I am in this fight.

1049
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:26,971
Let's get
this over with.

1050
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:39,162
It's got one bullet.

1051
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:40,859
All right.

1052
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:01,627
Take care of my car.

1053
01:11:11,996 --> 01:11:14,267
Stop.

1054
01:11:14,269 --> 01:11:16,058
Damn it,
what's with this guy?

1055
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:19,834
What in the name of god
are you doing to this poor man?

1056
01:11:19,836 --> 01:11:21,402
Padre,
you're gonna have to stop.

1057
01:11:21,404 --> 01:11:23,003
Don't take another step.

1058
01:11:23,005 --> 01:11:26,491
Pastor Erikson, you need
to leave. You don't know--

1059
01:11:26,493 --> 01:11:28,507
and I do not wish to know.

1060
01:11:28,508 --> 01:11:31,866
Free this man.
Wait. Don't do it.

1061
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:33,146
Restrain him.

1062
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:38,906
Get off me.

1063
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:40,218
What are you doing?

1064
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,586
Think about it.
You saw the demon. You saw it.

1065
01:11:42,588 --> 01:11:45,083
- You shut your mouth.
- You saw the demon.

1066
01:11:45,085 --> 01:11:47,034
You will not poison me.

1067
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:50,906
I'm trying to help you, pastor.
What are you gonna do, kill me?

1068
01:12:36,859 --> 01:12:39,258
Be gone, devil.

1069
01:12:51,675 --> 01:12:54,298
Get away from me.

1070
01:13:05,276 --> 01:13:06,587
There's no chance.

1071
01:13:06,589 --> 01:13:08,666
There's no fucking chance.

1072
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:12,538
You heard the lady.

1073
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,099
Oh, you sick fucker.

1074
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:50,714
Evelyn, don't do it.

1075
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:54,490
Don't kill it.

1076
01:16:22,939 --> 01:16:25,690
<i> I've been doing</i>
<i> this a long time.</i>

1077
01:16:25,692 --> 01:16:27,898
<i> I can't tell you</i>
<i> if there's a heaven or hell,</i>

1078
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,626
<i> or what's out there.</i>

1079
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:31,834
<i> But one thing I can</i>
<i> tell you for certain</i>

1080
01:16:31,836 --> 01:16:34,714
<i> is that evil exists.</i>

1081
01:16:35,995 --> 01:16:38,938
<i> You can run away from it,</i>
<i> you can bury it,</i>

1082
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:42,138
<i> maybe you can</i>
<i> even slow it down,</i>

1083
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,674
<i> but you can't stop it.</i>

1084
01:16:43,676 --> 01:16:47,834
<i> Sooner or later, maybe</i>
<i> not even in your lifetime,</i>

1085
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:50,746
<i> that evil will be back.</i>
