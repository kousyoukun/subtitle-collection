1
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:09,339
Get him, boy.

2
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:21,885
Titus!

3
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:26,690
Come here, boy!

4
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,041
Hey! Titus!

5
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:45,575
Titus!

6
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:16,840
There you are, boy.

7
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,547
What the hell's the matter
with you?

8
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,999
Nicely done, Titus.

9
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:46,603
Looks like I got me
a treasure-sniffing dog.

10
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:56,713
Titus, Titus, Titus. No!

11
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:01,051
No, no, no!

12
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:02,819
Titus, no!

13
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,823
No.

14
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:10,227
No.

15
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:48,832
Your father's home early.

16
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,604
Hey there, how'd it go?

17
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:33,410
Thanks for reading to me.
I need reading glasses

18
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,078
no problem.
One day.

19
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,585
Sure we'll like this...

20
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,522
Gabriel?

21
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:47,858
Are you all right?
What's the matter?

22
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,761
Baby? Baby?

23
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,867
Gabriel,
you son of a bitch.

24
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,982
Daddy?

25
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:27,090
You look so pretty,
i wanna twirl you like a top.

26
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,926
Stop.
Come on, Amber.

27
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:32,128
Wanna play something sexy
and dance? Hm?

28
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,098
No, I don't.
Don't touch me.

29
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,234
Come on, now.

30
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:39,669
Just one dance, huh?

31
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,471
Come on, like old times,
like old times--

32
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:43,039
frank, stop.

33
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,642
Amber, why are you teasing me
like this then?

34
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:47,911
Frank, I told you,
you're cut off.

35
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:49,646
This ain't a charity.

36
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:52,816
Just one dance. Come on, now.
Frank, get off.

37
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:56,853
You know I'm good for it.

38
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:59,122
Good for nothing.

39
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:04,861
Hey there.

40
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:08,398
I like your hat.

41
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:12,369
My daddy used to have
a hat like this.

42
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:17,507
Me and you...Could have
some fun with that hat.

43
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:18,975
Amber, listen.

44
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:21,411
Stop. Can't you see
I'm talking to somebody?

45
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:23,413
Who, this guy?
Yes, this guy.

46
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,649
We were just having
a wonderful conversation

47
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:27,984
about my daddy,
so get out of here.

48
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:34,157
Hey, shithead.
You talking to my girl?

49
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,825
Sir,

50
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,561
just leave me out of this.

51
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,930
Look, what I said was--

52
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:02,018
see, today...

53
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,688
We all learned about
a real important word

54
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,091
and that word is
"consent."

55
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:09,159
What?

56
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:11,895
You see, if two people
wanna make love,

57
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:13,263
that's a very
beautiful thing

58
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:16,066
if it's between
two consenting adults.

59
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,333
If the lady keeps
saying no,

60
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:20,503
and you just keep going
anyway, well...

61
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:22,072
You're just a piece
of shit, really.

62
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:25,909
Please, leave me alone. Help.

63
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,178
I'm really sorry, man.
Just please let me--

64
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,947
well, I think she
told you

65
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,749
quite clearly...

66
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,651
To leave her alone.

67
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:37,353
So I think you owe her
an apology.

68
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:41,091
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

69
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:43,660
For?

70
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,495
For being a piece
of shit.

71
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:47,764
I'm a piece of shit.

72
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,933
Are you a piece of shit?
I'm a piece of shit.

73
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:51,267
Really?
Yes.

74
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,603
Say it again.
I'm a piece of shit.

75
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:56,005
Ugh!
All right. Good.

76
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,110
It's all right,
buddy.

77
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:02,979
It's over now.
I ain't gonna lie to you,

78
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:05,682
you'll probably have a pretty
bad headache in the morning.

79
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:07,917
Get this guy some
ice cream.

80
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,753
You like ice cream?
Yeah.

81
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:12,021
Always makes me
feel better.

82
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:14,958
Rocky road
or something.

83
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,328
You-- you wanna get
out of here?

84
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:24,134
Let's go.
That was amazing.

85
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:26,236
I thought you killed him
at first.

86
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:28,138
No,
i don't kill people.

87
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,240
Well, I try not to,
anyway.

88
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:32,776
Say, you got a place
around here?

89
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:35,612
About six blocks down
the road.

90
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:37,247
Good.

91
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:39,883
Because I sleep
in my car.

92
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:11,908
What's the matter,
you can't decide?

93
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,643
Oh. Heh.

94
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:15,178
These old things?

95
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,680
No, I'm just looking
for all the luck I can get.

96
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:20,917
Figure one of them's
gotta have something to it.

97
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,986
So you from around here?

98
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:27,490
As of late, yeah.

99
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:29,826
How come I haven't seen you
at the bar before?

100
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:32,095
I stay to myself
mostly,

101
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:34,864
but I do venture out
every now and then.

102
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,637
So it'll be a hundred dollars
for the night.

103
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,541
I usually charge 150,
but I really do like this hat.

104
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:48,278
Pardon me, I did enjoy
a few last night,

105
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,880
but I don't think I recall
entering into

106
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:54,417
that sort of agreement.
What are you, fucking stupid?

107
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:58,187
Do you think that a girl
that looks like this

108
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:00,356
is gonna be in
a shithole bar like that

109
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:02,058
if it wasn't
for a damn paycheck?

110
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:07,297
Don't turn away from me.
Quiet now.

111
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:10,867
Another murder
 in the town of chicory creek.

112
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,302
This is the latest killing

113
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:14,537
in a town that has had
 three triple homicides

114
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,539
in the last week alone.

115
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,608
The authorities say
 the killings are unrelated.

116
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,710
Later on tonight, though...

117
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:23,513
I'll be damned.

118
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,515
You can't just leave.

119
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,717
You owe me money.

120
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:34,624
Thank you. Come again.

121
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:38,454
Good morning to you,
ma'am.

122
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:39,989
Holy hell.

123
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,991
Ain't you little
Evelyn Pierce?

124
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:45,528
My god, I ain't seen you
in maybe 20-some odd years.

125
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,929
Otis, right?

126
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,365
Yeah.

127
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,535
You looking real fine, evy,
i gotta tell you that.

128
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,871
Like, you must be doing
really well for yourself.

129
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm looking for chief Dunham.
Is he available?

130
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,308
Uh, yeah--

131
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,646
no, actually, the chief--
he's currently indisposed, so...

132
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:06,616
He's got a very pressing
investigation

133
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:08,418
at the time, so--

134
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,453
basically,
he told me nobody

135
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:14,023
is allowed inside whatsoever,
not even you, evy.

136
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:15,291
But I'll tell you what,

137
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:18,428
if you, maybe,
have some time

138
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,263
and wanna have some company,

139
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:22,498
you and I could go down
the street,

140
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,835
maybe grab a coffee, donut.
Hm...

141
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,937
It's agent Pierce.

142
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:29,739
I'm here on business.

143
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,007
No shit.

144
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:33,643
Look at you then,
little "evil lyn."

145
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:37,346
You grew up and became yourself
a big old bad federale.

146
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:39,148
I'll be goddamned.

147
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,286
Officer Willard,
i gotta tell you something.

148
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:47,757
I hate being called
"evil lyn."

149
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,760
So just stick with the formal.
Agent Pierce.

150
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:54,464
All right. What, the bureau done
got you all serious now?

151
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:58,501
All right, agent Pierce.

152
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:00,903
I'm gonna go tell him
you're here.

153
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,905
No need.
I'll do it myself.

154
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:05,174
All right, hey, you can't park
out here, neither.

155
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:07,076
It's supposed to be parked
around back.

156
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,479
Well, then you go park it.

157
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:13,816
I'm not parking anything.

158
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:17,253
I'll stay right here
with a cigarette.

159
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:19,055
Look...

160
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:21,390
As a spiritual leader
in the community

161
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:25,328
I should be kept in the loop
of this investigation.

162
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,297
The more I know,
the better I can guide.

163
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:31,501
Well, again, I'm gonna take
your interest into account,

164
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:34,036
but I'm kind of busy now.
I got a meeting here

165
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:36,139
in five minutes.
Say no more, Marty.

166
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:38,441
I can see you got
a full plate.

167
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,010
Mm.

168
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,580
Come in.

169
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,885
Pastor. Ahem.

170
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:52,221
Well, Evelyn Pierce.

171
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:54,123
My, this is a surprise.

172
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,825
They told me they were
sending someone from

173
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:59,262
the Jackson field office
but I had no idea it'd be you.

174
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:02,431
You know,
it is great to see you.

175
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,267
It's been how many
years?

176
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:06,269
A very long time,
chief Dunham.

177
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:07,737
I've been looking for
a good excuse

178
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:10,806
to come back here to visit.

179
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:14,877
Well, now, tell me,
agent Pierce, is it--?

180
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,814
Is it really necessary
bringing in the bureau and all?

181
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:21,050
You have had three triple
homicides

182
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:23,452
in the past week,
is that correct?

183
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:26,689
Well, now,
that is technically true,

184
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:30,059
but ain't nothing that the good
men and women of the c.C.D.P

185
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:32,295
can't handle on their own.

186
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:34,163
No one's trying to do
your job for you.

187
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:35,631
I don't wanna be here
just as much

188
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,466
as you don't want me
to be here.

189
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:40,803
If this was one murder, it would
not fall under our jurisdiction.

190
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:43,306
But it's been three separate
cases committed

191
00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:44,740
by three separate perps.
Hm.

192
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,576
Means it could be domestic
terrorism,

193
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:48,311
and we investigate that.

194
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:50,112
You know what, agent Pierce?
I can assure you

195
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:53,316
there are no terrorists here
in old chicory creek.

196
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:55,451
I'm sure you're right.

197
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,254
My job is to make sure that
these cases are unrelated

198
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:00,022
and I will be on my way.

199
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:03,626
Well, now, you know what?
That makes good sense.

200
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,728
I like that.

201
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:10,166
They are unrelated, right?

202
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:12,268
Uh...

203
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,970
Yeah.

204
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:19,242
Well, they might be
the tiniest bit related

205
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:21,811
if you was to look at them
in a certain way.

206
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,813
And what way
would that be, chief?

207
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:26,482
Each one killed the last.

208
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:30,920
Yes, that is true.

209
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,588
Excuse me, who are you?

210
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,791
Sir, I told you,
you cannot be in here.

211
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,727
Chief, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:40,363
He don't listen very well.
He just barged right past me.

213
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,198
Jebediah woodley.

214
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,001
Mr. woodley, you can't just
come in and barge in like this.

215
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,370
Listen, tough guy,
put them hands behind your back.

216
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:48,938
- In a minute.
- Mr. woodley,

217
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,874
this is a private meeting.
I have to ask you to leave.

218
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:54,410
- Real private, the three of us.
- Okay, funny man.

219
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:56,579
Let's put them big-ass
hands behind--

220
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,414
sir,

221
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,449
your town is in real danger.

222
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:02,485
I'm here to help.
Mr. woodley,

223
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,588
you are interrupting
an active FBI investigation.

224
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,189
You're FBI?
Yes.

225
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:10,426
Well, that's a use of
tax dollars I can get behind.

226
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:12,261
Now, get this assclown
out of here.

227
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:14,397
All right.
Come with me. Come on.

228
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,632
You want these murders to stop,
you best listen.

229
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:18,734
You have some information
on these murders?

230
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:20,703
Yep. Get him away
from me.

231
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:23,839
I prefer to have you in cuffs,
but okay. Let him go.

232
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,677
Make it quick, Mr. woodley.

233
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:39,121
Let me start by saying
you're not gonna believe

234
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:41,457
one damn thing
I'm about to say.

235
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:44,226
But that don't make
it a lie.

236
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:49,131
Why don't you start with who
you are and what you know?

237
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,668
I'm a hunter.

238
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:56,972
Demon hunter.

239
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,774
Demon hunter.

240
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:01,143
For a second, I thought
you weren't wasting our time.

241
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:03,546
Get this guy out of here,
put him in cuffs.

242
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:05,381
I've done this
100 times, honey.

243
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:07,583
Come on, demon hunter.
Get him out of here.

244
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:09,852
That's enough, Mr. woodley.
I tell people what I do,

245
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:12,922
they just sit there,
looking dumbstruck or laugh.

246
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:16,158
Then they gotta see something
on their own that proves it.

247
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,961
Maybe they see me pull one
of these things out of their son

248
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:21,397
his body twitching
and flapping in ways

249
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,998
the human body ought
not to do.

250
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,201
Or they see their momma
looking back

251
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:26,936
with those dead,
black eyes.

252
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:29,105
Or sometimes,
they never do come around.

253
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,440
That is, until they
get possessed themselves

254
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:33,776
and feel indescribable
pain and fear

255
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:35,778
that comes
with losing control

256
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,279
of your body
as your conscious self,

257
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:40,649
your soul, burns and evaporates
into the abyss,

258
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:41,917
like you never was.

259
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,819
Now, every once
in a while,

260
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:45,855
I'll meet someone,
or maybe a pair of folks

261
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:49,225
that aren't so thickheaded and
think that it's pure coincidence

262
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:52,661
that I end up here
in the middle of fucking nowhere

263
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:55,131
and without asking,
know exactly

264
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,032
the patterns
of the murders in question.

265
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:59,468
And when those people
put their trust in me

266
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,937
and just let their doubts
aside, then

267
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,607
lives are saved,
lives that would've been lost

268
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,509
had I just got tossed
out of here

269
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:08,210
and have to do
all this shit on my own.

270
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:11,313
But, you know, sometimes,
the lives saved are their own.

271
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:13,849
Now,
having heard that,

272
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,418
are you gonna hear
me out?

273
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,520
Are you?

274
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,722
Are you gonna hear
me out?

275
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:24,260
Make sure you keep
an eye on him.

276
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:26,128
Where are you
off to?

277
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,031
None of your business.

278
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,499
The eyes.

279
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:34,170
Ask about the eyes.

280
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,503
Kind of...Dark in here.

281
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:09,839
See if I can find
the light.

282
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:22,985
Pretty messy, huh?

283
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:26,856
Do you have those pictures?
Yeah.

284
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:38,300
This is the daughter here?

285
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:40,269
Yeah. That's her.

286
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,975
And that's the son over there?
Yup, that's him.

287
00:21:49,546 --> 00:21:51,680
And Mr. banks
killed them both?

288
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:53,682
No, he shot
the daughter.

289
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,487
Father shot this one--

290
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,923
--after shooting Mr. banks.

291
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:02,525
You're saying he
killed him

292
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:04,326
and then killed his own kid?
Yeah.

293
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:06,061
Doesn't make any sense.
Well...

294
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:11,000
You said there was
a live witness on this?

295
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:12,801
Yup.

296
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:15,137
I'm gonna need
to talk to them.

297
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,951
Mrs. macullum?

298
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:34,356
My name is Evelyn Pierce,
I'm with the FBI.

299
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:37,760
Is it all right if I come in
and have a word with you?

300
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,234
I'm really sorry
to disturb you.

301
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:49,238
I know you're going through
a terrible ordeal.

302
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,574
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

303
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:54,310
They always used to fight.

304
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:57,112
Who? Who used to fight?

305
00:22:58,782 --> 00:23:01,750
Benjamin and Bethany.

306
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:03,953
So rambunctious.

307
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:06,555
They could ruin
an entire house

308
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:08,724
if you didn't keep
an eye on them.

309
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:10,960
Those--
were those your kids?

310
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:14,530
I used to scream
at them.

311
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:18,100
I'd get so angry.

312
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:20,202
But I didn't want them
hurting each other.

313
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:23,572
I didn't want them
growing up so...

314
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:26,609
Violently.

315
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:29,878
But they were just playing.

316
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,515
That was not violence.

317
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:36,585
I never knew what
violence was.

318
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:41,890
Mrs. macullum, I just need you
to tell me what happened--

319
00:23:41,892 --> 00:23:44,727
I think about all the times
i sent them to their room.

320
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:48,163
All the times I didn't
speak to them, the time...

321
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,703
The time I lost with them
that I'll never have back.

322
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:58,007
Daniel always let
them fight.

323
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:01,110
They were fighting that night
when Marcus came in.

324
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:04,713
And when Marcus came in,
what happened?

325
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:22,031
He shot Bethany.

326
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:28,904
If you need a bit
more time, i--

327
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,340
but Daniel,
he was quick to draw.

328
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:35,277
He was a marine,
 on leave from Iraq.

329
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,645
So strong.

330
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:38,247
That's why I married him.

331
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:43,052
I wanted my children to come
from a strong man like Daniel.

332
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:45,120
And he told me to hide
in the closet,

333
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:47,489
and he shot that bastard Marcus.

334
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,294
Shot him dead.

335
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,231
My husband, he did.

336
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:06,275
He shot Benjamin.

337
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:17,753
My Daniel shot our boy.

338
00:25:19,122 --> 00:25:22,858
And then he came after me.

339
00:25:25,962 --> 00:25:30,032
Why? Why? Why?
Mrs. macullum, just settle down.

340
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,267
I can come back another time.
Why? Why?

341
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,969
Why? Why?

342
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:38,874
And his eyes,
they were black.

343
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,845
Black, black, black.

344
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:46,381
His eyes were black,
black, black.

345
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:48,016
They were black.

346
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:56,525
Where did he go?

347
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:09,505
It's agent Evelyn Pierce.

348
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:12,741
I need to be connected
to Deacon Shepherd's office.

349
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:14,176
Agent Pierce?

350
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:16,678
Sir, I still have this woodley
in custody.

351
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,247
Has records gotten back
to you?

352
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:21,250
Yeah. Turns out he has
 a pretty respectful rap sheet.

353
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:24,086
Aggravated assault, resisting
 arrest, the list goes on.

354
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:26,054
The thing is,
i don't think he's a suspect,

355
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,756
but he knows more than
he should.

356
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:30,859
The murders haven't stopped,
 so see what he knows.

357
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:32,561
Yes, sir.

358
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:46,909
Hey, now.

359
00:26:46,911 --> 00:26:48,844
That was quicker
than I thought.

360
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:51,146
Tell me what you know.

361
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,385
Well, I don't know.

362
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:01,423
I'm kind of hungry now.

363
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:08,330
Mm.

364
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,149
These are really great ribs.
Heh, heh.

365
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:29,618
So...

366
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,554
You have a demon.
Just one, and I know which,

367
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:35,591
because I been chasing him
for half my damn life now.

368
00:27:35,593 --> 00:27:38,861
How do you know that this demon
is the one you seek?

369
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:43,031
Its means of transfiguration,
the way it changes form--

370
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,833
it's unique.

371
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:48,237
I'm not gonna sit and talk about
the history of these shits.

372
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,906
I don't know if there's god
or hell, but these exist.

373
00:27:50,908 --> 00:27:52,608
I know
because I've killed them.

374
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,810
I know 'cause they killed
friends of mine.

375
00:27:54,812 --> 00:27:56,678
Mm-hm.
I don't give a rat's ass

376
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,881
if you believe in it or not.

377
00:27:58,883 --> 00:28:01,583
I don't want you
to mess this up for me.

378
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:04,319
So just do what I tell you...

379
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,188
And you might just survive.

380
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,991
You said this one
is unique. How?

381
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:10,559
Every demon's different,

382
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:13,195
but they all have their own
means of transfiguration.

383
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:16,231
Some only stay in you
 for a couple seconds,

384
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:18,667
you know,
 like you didn't even know it.

385
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:21,003
Aah!
Others...

386
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:23,171
Will take you over
 for their entire lives.

387
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:24,940
And you have to pry
 them loose,

388
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:27,442
which is often easier said
than done.

389
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:31,580
Some of them
just gotta touch you.

390
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:36,752
Others will only pass
through sexual exchanges.

391
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:43,292
Some of these things will just
leave you to stick to a doorway

392
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:46,061
like an invisible spider web
just waiting for the next fella

393
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:47,930
to walk past.

394
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:49,331
Most of them like
to move.

395
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,333
I like the ones that stay
in one place.

396
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:53,769
But they all have one thing
in common:

397
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:55,437
They exist to destroy.

398
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,205
There's just something
 about us,

399
00:28:57,207 --> 00:29:00,342
about our world,
 that they wanna end.

400
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:02,911
So, what about
this one?

401
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:04,479
How does
this one work?

402
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:08,116
Many years ago, my old man
and I, came across a small town

403
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:10,218
not unlike this one
y'all got here.

404
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,387
Thing had been there
 for a couple of days.

405
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:14,523
Nearly the whole town
 had gotten killed.

406
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:17,926
It was unusual because demons
 normally aren't responsible

407
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:19,361
for those type of body counts.

408
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:21,897
They're more partial
to personal torment.

409
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,365
But this thing was
different.

410
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:26,234
See, the way it transfigured
was by being killed.

411
00:29:26,236 --> 00:29:28,470
The moment you killed it,
it became you.

412
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:33,208
Which, needless to say,
complicated things.

413
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,077
So anyway,
 me and my dad sat there

414
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,446
and explained
 this to the townfolks,

415
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,281
just like I'm explaining it
 to you now.

416
00:29:39,283 --> 00:29:41,016
Course, they believed us
 straight on,

417
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:43,318
having seen the carnage
 themselves.

418
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Okay. So how'd you kill it?

419
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:47,756
See, my old man
 had the brave idea.

420
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:49,524
He sacrificed himself.

421
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:53,061
He drank a poison,
 and then he killed it.

422
00:29:53,063 --> 00:29:55,530
So the demon
 had no place to go.

423
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:59,267
And I could trap it.

424
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:04,573
Well, I'm so sorry.

425
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:07,242
I lost my daddy
to prostate cancer.

426
00:30:07,244 --> 00:30:10,545
That's a shame.
So how did you lose the demon?

427
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,414
I'm getting to it.
It's complicated.

428
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:14,683
I tried to hang onto it
for 30 years.

429
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:17,586
It just had a funny way
of slipping out of my hands.

430
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:19,488
You see, the thing has
a life of its own.

431
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,323
It doesn't wanna stay
in that box.

432
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:23,725
It's got a way of influencing
the world around it.

433
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:26,395
Okay. How did you lose it,
Mr. woodley?

434
00:30:26,397 --> 00:30:28,230
You can't kill the thing.
All you can do

435
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:30,265
is put it where no one
will ever get to it.

436
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:32,401
So I rented a plane,
came down here.

437
00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:34,002
Was gonna drop it here
in the bayou.

438
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,971
Engine trouble,

439
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:38,173
fire starts,
i gotta bail out.

440
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:40,275
Plane just scatters itself
all around town.

441
00:30:40,277 --> 00:30:42,911
I remember investigating
that crash.

442
00:30:42,913 --> 00:30:44,946
Good for you.
Anyhow,

443
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:48,683
middle of the bayou ain't
a bad place to hide the thing.

444
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:51,219
So I just stuck around town
for a while,

445
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:53,422
just in case somebody
stumbled upon it.

446
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:55,657
Which is good,
because that's what happened.

447
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:02,497
Well,

448
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:05,400
some nice trees they
have here.

449
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:08,603
Seem to have forgotten
my wallet. Heh, heh.

450
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:11,907
What?

451
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:15,110
Fine.
This one's on me.

452
00:31:15,112 --> 00:31:17,446
Thank you very much.

453
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:20,882
So let's just say
any part of that is true.

454
00:31:20,884 --> 00:31:24,319
You got a plan?
I suggest you find the man

455
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,321
that killed the last
of those three murderers.

456
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:28,623
Hold a town meeting
with everyone except him,

457
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,659
tell them what happened
and maybe

458
00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:33,662
we can work together on this.
You wanna tell an entire town

459
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:36,064
there's a body-hopping demon
on the loose?

460
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:37,332
Something like that.

461
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:38,934
That will only
exacerbate things.

462
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:41,203
Even if they believe you,
which I highly doubt,

463
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:44,739
this town is ultra-Christian.
They're gonna go into a panic.

464
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:47,576
Chief Dunham, is there
an emergency system

465
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:50,278
at the local school so we
can keep the children safe?

466
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,681
Well, now, agent Pierce,
you're gonna have to pardon me,

467
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:55,617
but I think you spent a little
too much time in Washington.

468
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:57,752
This here's chicory creek,
Mississippi.

469
00:31:57,754 --> 00:32:00,689
We just got our first stoplight
about six months ago. Heh, heh.

470
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:03,625
I'm sorry,
but this plan is ridiculous.

471
00:32:03,627 --> 00:32:05,327
I'm not gonna let you
get this town

472
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,395
into a frenzy
just on your word alone.

473
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:10,165
Fine. I'll wait for you
to wise up then.

474
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:13,368
Chief, how can I find the man
who killed the last murderer?

475
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,903
What are you gonna do
when you find him?

476
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:17,139
Oh, I'll sit him down
for a quiet little chat.

477
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:18,740
If we help you,
then I'm coming.

478
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:20,675
As much as I'd love
to spend some time

479
00:32:20,677 --> 00:32:22,477
with a lovely lady
like yourself,

480
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:25,247
I work alone.
We're gonna do this my way,

481
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:27,816
or you can take a seat
back in that cell.

482
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:30,685
Your choice.
All right, then.

483
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,621
And if you make one
false move,

484
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:35,690
I will not hesitate
to shoot you myself.

485
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:39,528
Fair enough.
Let's get my shit and get going.

486
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,964
Now. Now, let's see
what we got in here.

487
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:46,501
So one ruger.

488
00:32:46,503 --> 00:32:49,804
Three-five-seven Magnum...

489
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:54,476
And holster
with twelve rubber bullets.

490
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:59,247
I like this here, one vaporizer.

491
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,186
One small-animal trap.

492
00:33:04,188 --> 00:33:06,421
Careful with that.

493
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:10,425
South American bola balls.

494
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:16,498
And last but not least,

495
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,668
one whip with two...

496
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,603
Shrunken heads.

497
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:24,906
Oh, shit, just put down "whip."
One whip.

498
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:30,612
What?

499
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:37,452
- All right. Pull over.
- This should be it.

500
00:33:37,454 --> 00:33:40,055
The house of the man
who shot the last murderer.

501
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:43,391
One Jeremy ruckner.

502
00:33:58,307 --> 00:34:01,076
What, do you live in your car?
Uh-huh.

503
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,812
Course you do.

504
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:07,082
What on earth is that?
It's my net gun.

505
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:09,017
She's my pride and joy.

506
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:11,419
How does she work?

507
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:14,089
Well, it's
a pressurized release.

508
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:16,758
The nets fly out,
they're weighted at the ends.

509
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,694
They knock the victim off
its feet, don't kill it.

510
00:34:19,696 --> 00:34:21,329
Let me see.

511
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:26,601
Jeez. Just a little heavier
than it looks.

512
00:34:26,603 --> 00:34:28,570
Uh-huh.

513
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:31,039
Okay. That should be
the house there.

514
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,775
How does he know where he
lives if he's possessed?

515
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:35,277
Instinct.

516
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:37,879
Hasn't been any murders
for a while.

517
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:41,182
Reckon he's taking a break.
Seen him do it before.

518
00:34:44,787 --> 00:34:46,721
Somebody's coming.

519
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:01,836
Hey, you shouldn't
even have that thing on you.

520
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,539
Oh, I'll be holding onto it,
thank you very much.

521
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:07,375
You shoot him with that,
you're gonna regret it.

522
00:35:07,377 --> 00:35:09,444
Trust me on that.

523
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:13,481
Wait here.

524
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:40,542
Howdy.

525
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:51,519
Oh, my god.

526
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:53,988
Yeah. It can be a dirty job,
that's for sure.

527
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:57,892
Oh, my god. It's horrible.

528
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:59,761
Takes some getting
used to.

529
00:35:59,763 --> 00:36:02,897
Who the fuck are you?
It can talk?

530
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:06,267
Uh, no. No. He's not
supposed to do that.

531
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:08,069
Unhand me.

532
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:10,071
Shit.
What?

533
00:36:10,073 --> 00:36:12,140
What's the matter?

534
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:14,843
It's not him.
What do you mean it's not him?

535
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,512
Well, it's him,
but he ain't possessed.

536
00:36:17,514 --> 00:36:19,214
Drunk as piss
by the smell of him,

537
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:22,016
but he ain't possessed.
Who the fuck are you?

538
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:24,552
Sorry, sir. Well,

539
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:26,621
we seem to have made
some kind of mistake.

540
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:29,524
I'm sorry, buddy.
Mistake?

541
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:31,626
You nearly broke
my arms.

542
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:33,795
This is complete bullshit,
isn't it?

543
00:36:33,797 --> 00:36:36,064
No, it's not bullshit.
He's not the guy

544
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:38,800
who did the last shooting.
The hell I ain't.

545
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:41,970
Three days ago I put
that crazy bastard down

546
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:43,705
with that gun right
up there.

547
00:36:43,707 --> 00:36:46,541
I'm the best shot
in Mississippi.

548
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:48,576
Okay, so? He said he shot him.

549
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:51,112
Okay. Tell me exactly
what happened.

550
00:36:51,114 --> 00:36:54,215
Well, ain't you heard?
I shot the fucker.

551
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:55,884
I got him right
in the gut.

552
00:36:55,886 --> 00:36:58,753
Did anybody do anything else
to his body after you shot him?

553
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:01,556
Well, yeah, Glen prichard ran up
and finished him off,

554
00:37:01,558 --> 00:37:04,592
but I'm the one who put him down
and stopped the killing.

555
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:06,961
You ask anybody.
So, what happened to prichard?

556
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:08,963
Where'd he go?
He ran off.

557
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:12,667
After he done it, he just
looked at us and took off.

558
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:15,003
Probably couldn't stand
the sight of the blood.

559
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:17,639
Pussy.
All right. We're done here.

560
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:20,008
This does not prove
anything.

561
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,309
Uh-huh.

562
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:23,778
Hey, wait a minute.
Get up.

563
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,547
Hey, you haven't
told me

564
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:28,783
why you shot me
with that damn net.

565
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,752
- All right.
- Just was a bad dream.

566
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:33,455
You just go back to bed, now,
come on.

567
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,492
Merry Christmas.

568
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:46,468
Wow, do you really
have to do that in the car?

569
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:02,584
Didn't have enough ribs
for lunch?

570
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,621
No, thank you.

571
00:38:13,396 --> 00:38:15,830
Shit.

572
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:27,075
Damn it.

573
00:38:27,077 --> 00:38:29,511
Car's overheating.
Happens all the time.

574
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,045
I knew I should've
never trusted you.

575
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,548
We need to get to the station.
Can you shut up?

576
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,417
Excuse me? You should be
kissing my ass right now.

577
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:38,319
I could've left you in
that cell to rot.

578
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:39,521
Shh.

579
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:42,223
Don't "shush" me.
Quiet.

580
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:48,296
I just saw something.

581
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:55,036
I don't see--

582
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:56,971
something's watching us
from the woods.

583
00:38:56,973 --> 00:38:59,140
I don't see anything.
Shh.

584
00:38:59,142 --> 00:39:01,109
Yeah. Right there.

585
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:06,581
Get in the car.
Don't say a word.

586
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,616
Stay quiet.

587
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:28,236
Get back in the car.

588
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:32,006
Is this for real?

589
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:04,939
Okay.

590
00:41:50,746 --> 00:41:52,213
Am I interrupting something?

591
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:10,498
Oh, shit.

592
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:20,274
Rubber bullets.
Works when you're in a jam.

593
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,309
I-- i--

594
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,011
I just--
breathe, try not to talk.

595
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,749
So I say we set
that town meeting

596
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:30,351
around 6 P.M. tomorrow.
Sound good to you?

597
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:48,402
Hi, y'all. Welcome.

598
00:42:48,404 --> 00:42:51,405
Good evening,
um, Mrs. kravitz.

599
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:54,275
Maybe you could help? Do you
have a first-aid kit here?

600
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:56,677
Yes, I have something
here somewhere.

601
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,181
That's terrific. We also need
two rooms for the evening.

602
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:04,619
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
but I only have one room left.

603
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:07,054
I'm afraid you'll
have to share.

604
00:43:12,694 --> 00:43:15,429
You need some help?

605
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:19,300
No, I was always pretty good
at do-it-yourself surgery.

606
00:43:25,274 --> 00:43:29,544
Thank you
for what you did.

607
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:32,446
Don't thank me.
Thank him.

608
00:43:32,448 --> 00:43:34,215
I don't understand.

609
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:36,851
When I got to you, I was pretty
sure he'd already killed you.

610
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:39,954
I've never seen it react that
way, the way he looked at you.

611
00:43:39,956 --> 00:43:41,823
I was relieved to see
you were alive

612
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:43,291
until I realized
what that meant.

613
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:46,994
It wants me to kill it.
Yeah. It appears so.

614
00:43:46,996 --> 00:43:49,096
Why?
It likes you.

615
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:52,400
Maybe it likes your body,
maybe it likes your soul.

616
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:55,803
He collects souls,
makes him more powerful.

617
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:57,939
The eyes, his eyes...

618
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:00,508
Yeah. I know.

619
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,945
Creepy as hell, right?
No, no. It--

620
00:44:03,947 --> 00:44:07,815
in his eyes, I saw something.

621
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:10,885
There were dark clouds,
lightning.

622
00:44:10,887 --> 00:44:13,821
There were people screaming.

623
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:16,624
It was terrible.

624
00:44:16,626 --> 00:44:18,226
I've never been so afraid.

625
00:44:18,228 --> 00:44:21,395
Now, that's unexpected.

626
00:44:22,798 --> 00:44:26,667
Here, let me help you.

627
00:44:26,669 --> 00:44:28,903
Let me help you.

628
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:38,446
So how long
have you been doing this?

629
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:39,947
Oh, um...

630
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:43,351
Pretty much
as long as I remember.

631
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:45,920
It was kind
of a family business.

632
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:47,989
Christmas must've been fun.
Heh.

633
00:44:50,526 --> 00:44:52,493
Thanks
for the warning.

634
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,741
So, uh,

635
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:09,877
is there any way
to get the demon

636
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:11,679
without hurting anyone?

637
00:45:16,218 --> 00:45:18,552
Well, I think you're getting
ahead of yourself.

638
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:21,422
If we don't catch
the thing then, uh,

639
00:45:23,158 --> 00:45:25,660
all this thinking
will be for nothing.

640
00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:30,932
Okay. Well...

641
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:36,671
You're all set.

642
00:45:38,907 --> 00:45:40,574
Thank you.

643
00:45:42,644 --> 00:45:46,881
Uh, I'll just change here if
you don't mind turning around.

644
00:45:46,883 --> 00:45:49,250
Okay. Sure. No problem.

645
00:46:13,342 --> 00:46:16,744
Look, I'm just
gonna go outside.

646
00:46:16,746 --> 00:46:18,179
Where?

647
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:21,716
I'm gonna sleep in the car.
It's--

648
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:23,417
it's pretty cozy actually.

649
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:26,387
There's plenty of space on
the floor, you don't have to--

650
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,364
hey, Nelson.

651
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:38,132
Sorry to wake you, buddy.

652
00:46:38,134 --> 00:46:40,434
Yeah. Can you run
a lineage check

653
00:46:40,436 --> 00:46:42,636
for me on an Evelyn Pierce?

654
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:44,505
Yeah. Cross reference
with your list,

655
00:46:44,507 --> 00:46:47,041
see if anything in
that family tree pops up.

656
00:46:49,945 --> 00:46:53,781
I gotta go. Get back to me
as soon as you can, all right?

657
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,530
Trouble sleeping?

658
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:16,537
I spent my childhood here.
Figured I would pay a visit.

659
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:19,206
Looks like that was
a nice farm a ways back.

660
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:22,209
Why was it abandoned?

661
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:25,746
Well, supposedly,

662
00:47:25,748 --> 00:47:27,214
it's cursed.

663
00:47:27,216 --> 00:47:28,649
And why is that?

664
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:30,885
My parents never
told me much.

665
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:36,023
From what I hear, there
was an easter celebration

666
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:38,092
and I fell in the pool.

667
00:47:38,094 --> 00:47:40,561
I hit my head on the edge
as I went in.

668
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:43,130
I think it was a few minutes
before anyone found me.

669
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:44,665
I was completely blue.

670
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:48,569
My mother, she grabbed me, and
she carried me into the house

671
00:47:48,571 --> 00:47:50,471
and when
she brought me back,

672
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:53,941
I was totally fine
like nothing had happened.

673
00:47:53,943 --> 00:47:58,412
I don't remember any of it,
but I do know what people say.

674
00:47:58,414 --> 00:48:00,347
It's like she brought me
back from the dead.

675
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:01,849
Next thing
i do remember

676
00:48:01,851 --> 00:48:04,752
is that people were throwing
rocks into our window

677
00:48:04,754 --> 00:48:08,089
and we just packed up, and we
left pretty quickly after that.

678
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:10,491
Well, Evelyn, I'm sorry
to hear all that.

679
00:48:10,493 --> 00:48:12,726
Everyone's got
their sob story, right?

680
00:48:12,728 --> 00:48:13,961
You know what I think?

681
00:48:13,963 --> 00:48:16,297
Now is an appropriate time
as any to tell you.

682
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:17,898
I was trying to figure out

683
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,601
why our black-eyed
friend up there liked you.

684
00:48:20,603 --> 00:48:22,336
What you saw in
his eyes,

685
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:24,338
the circumstances
of your family's departure

686
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,739
from chicory creek,

687
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:28,309
it all points at one thing.
What is that?

688
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:30,444
Well, there's
a slim chance

689
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:32,646
that your ancestors were,
and you are--

690
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:35,549
how do I put this?
Um, uh... ahem.

691
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:37,985
Well, look, there
are demons, right?

692
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:40,321
And at the other end
of the spectrum,

693
00:48:40,323 --> 00:48:43,457
there are beings that
descended from the light.

694
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:45,726
Are we talking about
fucking angels now?

695
00:48:45,728 --> 00:48:48,963
Well, you said it.
I know. Listen.

696
00:48:48,965 --> 00:48:51,098
Okay. Let's call
them angels.

697
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,100
Well, many,
many years ago,

698
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:54,635
according to the Bible
and stuff,

699
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:57,571
these angels descended to earth,
they mated with humans.

700
00:48:57,573 --> 00:49:01,442
They gave rise
to this divine bloodline.

701
00:49:01,444 --> 00:49:03,110
And you're saying
I'm one of them.

702
00:49:03,112 --> 00:49:04,712
What you saw in his eyes,

703
00:49:04,714 --> 00:49:07,248
your mother had that ability,
birthmarks on your back--

704
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,650
how did you see those?
You turned around? Did you--?

705
00:49:09,652 --> 00:49:12,286
There was just like
a reflection or something.

706
00:49:12,288 --> 00:49:15,089
I am the furthest from angelic.
Just--

707
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:18,125
listen to me,
if I'm right,

708
00:49:18,127 --> 00:49:20,628
the stakes
just got a whole lot higher.

709
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,896
And why is that?

710
00:49:21,898 --> 00:49:23,464
Because there's a dark place,

711
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:25,633
another plane,
existing next to ours.

712
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:27,701
It's full of dark things,
bad things.

713
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:29,803
What does that have to do
with me? With my family?

714
00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:32,740
If you are from that divine
bloodline I told you about,

715
00:49:32,742 --> 00:49:35,075
you have the ability
to connect with those worlds.

716
00:49:35,077 --> 00:49:40,381
And if the thing consumes your
soul, it will use your body.

717
00:49:40,383 --> 00:49:43,017
And he'll call up
his little demon buddies,

718
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,518
thousands of them.

719
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,521
And then chicory creek
literally will be hell on earth.

720
00:49:47,523 --> 00:49:50,658
Why does it need me?
Aren't there others like me?

721
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,526
I'm not too sure
there are any.

722
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:55,729
Listen,
i may be wrong,

723
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:59,266
but you'd better keep your
finger off that trigger.

724
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:09,343
Well, all right now,
great to see you too.

725
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:12,580
Hey, good to see you.
Hey, looking good.

726
00:50:12,582 --> 00:50:15,182
Come in, have a seat.
That's not what I'm saying.

727
00:50:15,184 --> 00:50:19,153
I'm just saying I think we
should have a team on standby.

728
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:22,556
Please. Please, look,
I'm really close here. Trust me.

729
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:24,959
Just give me a chance.

730
00:50:26,027 --> 00:50:29,697
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

731
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,634
Everything okay?
Yeah. It's good.

732
00:50:33,636 --> 00:50:36,870
Hey, hey, come on in.
Hey, good to see you.

733
00:50:36,872 --> 00:50:40,908
Oh, shit. Uh...

734
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,311
I know, father, I know.
What is this all about?

735
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:46,280
It's all gonna be
explained in a minute.

736
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:47,681
Now, come on, Marty.

737
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:50,584
My congregation
are truly worried.

738
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:51,652
Okay?

739
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:54,722
Now, I saw Evelyn Pierce
in your office.

740
00:50:56,157 --> 00:50:57,858
She is not to be trusted.

741
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,127
All right.

742
00:51:00,129 --> 00:51:03,430
Why don't you
just take a seat

743
00:51:03,432 --> 00:51:05,532
for your own sake.

744
00:51:12,774 --> 00:51:16,310
Ladies and gentlemen, I need
to get your attention, please.

745
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:17,811
Speak up, Dunham.

746
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:21,782
I'm gonna please ask
that you don't shout.

747
00:51:21,784 --> 00:51:24,752
Now, I know y'all
got a lot of questions,

748
00:51:24,754 --> 00:51:26,920
and we're gonna
take those questions

749
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:29,723
just as soon
as this meeting's done.

750
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:31,458
In the meantime,

751
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,095
I'm gonna have to ask
that you all remain calm.

752
00:51:35,097 --> 00:51:40,067
Now, it has come
to my attention

753
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:43,504
that the string of murders
earlier this week were--

754
00:51:43,506 --> 00:51:47,241
are connected.

755
00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:48,909
- What?
- What do you mean?

756
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:51,312
- How's that possible?
- What's next?

757
00:51:51,314 --> 00:51:53,547
Quiet, now.
Calm down, now.

758
00:51:55,451 --> 00:51:58,385
It appears...

759
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:01,789
Some kind of
supernatural thing afoot.

760
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:03,624
What the fuck?

761
00:52:03,626 --> 00:52:06,060
Eunice, that is not helping.
Now you shut up.

762
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,264
Now, sit down.
Y'all be quiet.

763
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:13,400
Y'all know we got
FBI working on this.

764
00:52:13,402 --> 00:52:15,035
This guy's coming in...
Oh, shit.

765
00:52:15,037 --> 00:52:17,571
...let's respect--
okay. Good evening, folks.

766
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:20,507
I'm jebediah
woodley.

767
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:22,910
That's right.

768
00:52:24,347 --> 00:52:25,846
I wanna talk to you
a little bit

769
00:52:25,848 --> 00:52:28,549
about what's happened
in town this past week.

770
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:31,218
I know you're all frightened,
as you should be,

771
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,222
but if you just cooperate and
listen to what I got to say,

772
00:52:35,224 --> 00:52:36,790
everybody's
gonna be fine.

773
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:39,259
Ahem. Well, most
of you are gonna be fine.

774
00:52:39,261 --> 00:52:40,561
Most of us?

775
00:52:40,563 --> 00:52:42,262
Well, look. Look,
just calm down now.

776
00:52:42,264 --> 00:52:43,797
I'm gonna explain it
to you.

777
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:46,667
I'm gonna explain what
happened. See, there's--

778
00:52:46,669 --> 00:52:49,069
well, just hear me
out now.

779
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:51,004
We'll get a chance
to talk about this later.

780
00:52:51,006 --> 00:52:52,539
I know you're
not gonna believe

781
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:55,075
some of the things
I'm about to say.

782
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:58,045
Some of you, well--
let me finish up.

783
00:52:58,047 --> 00:52:59,847
I'll explain it to you.

784
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:01,648
There's something going on
in this town,

785
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,817
and it's kind of scary,

786
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:05,486
but some of you will
have a problem

787
00:53:05,488 --> 00:53:07,621
believing what I'm
about to say now,

788
00:53:07,623 --> 00:53:09,456
but I gotta tell
you something.

789
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:12,059
Well, it's kind
of a strange story.

790
00:53:13,762 --> 00:53:15,429
Uh...

791
00:53:20,068 --> 00:53:23,504
Oh, shit.

792
00:53:23,506 --> 00:53:25,939
Everybody,
evacuate the premises.

793
00:53:46,394 --> 00:53:48,562
Don't shoot it.

794
00:54:01,443 --> 00:54:03,577
Let me shoot it.

795
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:08,782
For Pete's sake.

796
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,738
Hold still now.

797
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:11,678
Shit.

798
00:56:19,147 --> 00:56:21,148
What do we do now?

799
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,349
Call for backup.

800
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:25,252
This was the backup.
Shut your mouth, Dunham.

801
00:56:25,254 --> 00:56:28,622
He was trying his best.
They didn't listen to him.

802
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:30,123
If your men knew
how to follow orders,

803
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,758
we wouldn't be
in this mess.

804
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,927
I need your car now.

805
00:56:41,436 --> 00:56:42,903
All right.

806
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:44,938
Where are you going?
I'll do this on my own.

807
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,174
You need us.
Like hell I do.

808
00:56:47,176 --> 00:56:49,910
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna find it.

809
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:05,359
Four, five, six,

810
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:09,396
seven, eight, nine, ten.

811
00:57:09,398 --> 00:57:13,000
Ready or not, here I come.

812
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:26,146
You suck at this game.

813
00:57:26,148 --> 00:57:28,682
You know I only play
so that you'll leave me alone.

814
00:57:28,684 --> 00:57:30,350
When's daddy coming home?

815
00:57:30,352 --> 00:57:31,752
I told you, I don't know.

816
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:34,021
He's probably still down
at the town hall.

817
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:39,092
Who's that?

818
00:57:39,094 --> 00:57:42,129
Who's who?
The man outside.

819
00:57:44,466 --> 00:57:46,833
Get away
from the window, jezz.

820
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,084
Stay back.

821
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:13,827
Help.

822
00:58:15,697 --> 00:58:17,264
Help.

823
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:30,410
We need to find him.

824
00:58:30,412 --> 00:58:33,513
Look, I've been thinking this
over. Maybe he was right.

825
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:36,183
About what?
About me.

826
00:58:36,185 --> 00:58:38,919
Maybe it was my fault.
Maybe I shouldn't even be here.

827
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:41,788
Oh, come on, don't be a coward.
I got a heart condition.

828
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,824
Snap out of it.
Chief Dunham,

829
00:58:43,826 --> 00:58:45,492
regardless
of what jebediah says,

830
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:48,729
the fact remains, we need
all the help we can get.

831
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:52,899
I understand if you feel guilty
about the deaths of your men,

832
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:55,635
but you don't avenge them
by running away.

833
00:58:55,637 --> 00:58:57,471
You stand
and you fight.

834
00:58:57,473 --> 00:59:00,574
Okay? You stand here, and you
fight with me, chief Dunham.

835
00:59:00,576 --> 00:59:02,876
You defend this town.

836
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,248
Chief.

837
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,649
Chief.

838
00:59:09,651 --> 00:59:12,352
Chief Dunham, hey!

839
00:59:15,223 --> 00:59:16,990
Wow.

840
00:59:27,335 --> 00:59:30,103
What's going on here?

841
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:10,577
You.

842
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:15,182
Yeah.

843
01:00:15,184 --> 01:00:17,951
Why did you bring
this evil to this town?

844
01:00:17,953 --> 01:00:19,452
Excuse me?

845
01:00:19,454 --> 01:00:22,088
I do not know what your designs
are in chicory creek,

846
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,691
but I do know
that Evelyn Pierce,

847
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:26,459
like her mother
before her,

848
01:00:26,461 --> 01:00:29,896
had the blood of Satan
flowing in her veins.

849
01:00:29,898 --> 01:00:33,633
And you are in league with her,
are you not?

850
01:00:33,635 --> 01:00:35,502
You got this wrong.

851
01:00:35,504 --> 01:00:38,104
The important thing is now
you calm these people down.

852
01:00:38,106 --> 01:00:40,974
Why, pray tell,
should we believe you?

853
01:00:40,976 --> 01:00:44,377
How are we to know
that you are not in cahoots

854
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:47,480
with this hell spawn
that is attacking this town?

855
01:00:47,482 --> 01:00:51,318
You better calm down, padre.
I will do no such thing.

856
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,955
I see it now.
You are Lucifer's mouthpiece,

857
01:00:54,957 --> 01:00:57,791
and Evelyn Pierce
is his concubine.

858
01:00:57,793 --> 01:00:59,426
Aren't you taking
this a bit far?

859
01:00:59,428 --> 01:01:00,760
Be gone.

860
01:01:00,762 --> 01:01:03,830
Be gone, hell spawn.
Calm down.

861
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:05,265
Be gone.
That's rude.

862
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:06,666
I'd rather
you not do that.

863
01:01:06,668 --> 01:01:09,202
The power of Christ
compels you.

864
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:11,037
I'm pretty sure
that's from the exorcist.

865
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,139
Be gone, hell spawn.

866
01:01:13,141 --> 01:01:16,209
And tell
your lord Lucifer not--

867
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:19,613
oh, no.

868
01:01:22,017 --> 01:01:25,485
Calm down, y'all.
Rubber bullets.

869
01:01:25,487 --> 01:01:29,856
Padre, you all right
there, padre?

870
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:31,858
You all right?
Okay.

871
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,661
He'll be okay.
He'll be fine.

872
01:01:36,564 --> 01:01:38,465
Merry Christmas.

873
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:53,880
What do you want?
I wanna help you.

874
01:01:53,882 --> 01:01:55,749
You've helped plenty.
I got it from here.

875
01:01:55,751 --> 01:01:58,852
We're running out of time. Plus,
I'm the one it wants, right?

876
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:00,420
So don't
you want me around?

877
01:02:02,657 --> 01:02:05,425
That's exactly why
i don't want you around.

878
01:02:09,764 --> 01:02:11,398
Pastor.

879
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,566
Pastor Erikson.

880
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:15,135
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

881
01:02:15,137 --> 01:02:18,171
Pastor, he's-- well,
he's indisposed right now.

882
01:02:18,173 --> 01:02:21,308
Uh-uh. I gotta see the pastor.
My girl, she's gone mad.

883
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:23,410
I don't know what to do.
What's your name?

884
01:02:23,412 --> 01:02:24,411
Emmett.

885
01:02:24,413 --> 01:02:26,246
Emmett, tell me
what happened now.

886
01:02:26,248 --> 01:02:29,349
Wait a minute, you're the guy
from the town-hall meeting.

887
01:02:29,351 --> 01:02:31,584
What's going on? Is something
making people sick?

888
01:02:31,586 --> 01:02:33,253
Is my little girl sick?
Emmett,

889
01:02:33,255 --> 01:02:35,221
just tell me
exactly what happened.

890
01:02:35,223 --> 01:02:38,191
I got home
about an hour ago.

891
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:39,960
There was a man
outside on the front lawn

892
01:02:39,962 --> 01:02:41,962
with a bullet wound
in his head.

893
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:44,931
And I went inside,
and my little one,

894
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:46,700
my girl, she's got
a knife to her.

895
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:50,036
So I tell her to run,
and then she looks at me,

896
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:52,005
and her eyes were
all black. My girl--

897
01:02:52,007 --> 01:02:54,741
lead me to her.
Come on. Let's go.

898
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:57,110
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Let's go.

899
01:03:07,254 --> 01:03:09,055
She's down there.

900
01:03:10,992 --> 01:03:13,226
No other exit
to that basement, right?

901
01:03:13,228 --> 01:03:14,794
No, sir.
All right.

902
01:03:14,796 --> 01:03:15,996
How will we do this?

903
01:03:15,998 --> 01:03:17,530
Let me think
for a second here.

904
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:19,866
If she's possessed,
she in a lot of pain?

905
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:21,768
That's right.
She sure is.

906
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:24,404
There's gotta be a way I can
help. How can I help her?

907
01:03:24,406 --> 01:03:26,272
There is a way to do that.
How?

908
01:03:26,274 --> 01:03:30,276
The only way is by killing her.
What? What'd you say to me?

909
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:32,712
You're gonna be putting her
out of a lot of misery.

910
01:03:32,714 --> 01:03:34,748
I can't.

911
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,282
I can't kill my little girl.

912
01:03:36,284 --> 01:03:38,485
That ain't your little girl
down there no more.

913
01:03:38,487 --> 01:03:39,953
I don't understand.

914
01:03:39,955 --> 01:03:41,721
Wouldn't it just
be the same problems

915
01:03:41,723 --> 01:03:43,056
but inside of me now?

916
01:03:43,058 --> 01:03:44,724
What we're gonna do
is make poison,

917
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:47,360
you drink it, you go
down there, do the deed,

918
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:50,096
wait to die, you will
be with your girl.

919
01:03:50,098 --> 01:03:52,999
Wouldn't want her
to be alone, would you?

920
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,367
I can't.

921
01:03:54,369 --> 01:03:56,603
All right. I'll do it.
No.

922
01:03:56,605 --> 01:03:58,171
What--?

923
01:03:58,173 --> 01:03:59,706
What's she going
through right now?

924
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,541
She is screaming,
she's down there.

925
01:04:01,543 --> 01:04:03,943
She's burning up, waiting
for the whole thing to end.

926
01:04:03,945 --> 01:04:06,613
Oh, Jesus. There's
gotta be another way.

927
01:04:06,615 --> 01:04:09,315
I can't kill my daughter,
you gotta understand that.

928
01:04:09,317 --> 01:04:11,051
You listen to me.

929
01:04:11,053 --> 01:04:13,420
You wanna honor
your little girl,

930
01:04:13,422 --> 01:04:16,856
better put her out
of her misery.

931
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:22,562
All right.

932
01:04:22,564 --> 01:04:24,264
I'll do it.

933
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:29,469
Come on, Evelyn,
let's make this poison now.

934
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:39,212
How long will I have to bear it?
Couple of minutes, tops.

935
01:04:42,183 --> 01:04:44,951
Jesus, no.

936
01:04:44,953 --> 01:04:48,088
It's okay. It's okay.

937
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:53,827
Come on. You ready?

938
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:57,330
So she'll
be at rest?

939
01:04:57,332 --> 01:05:00,033
Once it's inside you,
it's out of her.

940
01:05:00,035 --> 01:05:01,601
What's it gonna
be like for me?

941
01:05:01,603 --> 01:05:05,505
Well, I'd be lying if I said
it was gonna be pleasant.

942
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:07,607
Here.

943
01:05:10,845 --> 01:05:12,812
So...

944
01:05:12,814 --> 01:05:16,382
I take this, and i--

945
01:05:16,384 --> 01:05:17,750
kill it.

946
01:05:20,988 --> 01:05:23,890
All right.

947
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:27,193
I know what I have to do.
Drink it while it's hot now.

948
01:05:28,162 --> 01:05:30,130
All right.

949
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:37,704
Thanks.

950
01:05:37,706 --> 01:05:39,506
Sure.

951
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:04,464
Everybody get down
on the ground.

952
01:06:04,466 --> 01:06:06,266
What the hell is going on?

953
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:08,268
I'm sorry. I thought
they'd give me more time.

954
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:10,203
You damn fool.
Shut your mouth.

955
01:06:10,205 --> 01:06:13,806
Guys,
I'm not doing too good.

956
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:16,609
Deacon Shepherd, look,
you're making a huge mistake.

957
01:06:16,611 --> 01:06:18,444
It's nice to see
you too, Evelyn.

958
01:06:18,446 --> 01:06:21,247
Give us a few more minutes.
Let us finish what we're doing.

959
01:06:21,249 --> 01:06:23,283
Then you can take over
the operation.

960
01:06:23,285 --> 01:06:26,152
Is that an order?

961
01:06:27,656 --> 01:06:30,323
Sir, something's
wrong with this one.

962
01:06:32,626 --> 01:06:35,228
What have you done to this man?

963
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,864
Drift leaf, mainly.

964
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:40,333
It's a poison.

965
01:06:40,335 --> 01:06:42,435
You poisoned this man?

966
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:45,638
Get him the hell
out of here.

967
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,143
Wait. What exactly
is your role in this?

968
01:06:50,145 --> 01:06:51,411
Go to hell.

969
01:06:51,413 --> 01:06:54,814
Got it. Hard case.
Put him in the Van.

970
01:06:56,418 --> 01:07:00,320
As for you, you go outside.
I'll talk to you later.

971
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:03,323
Wait. You have no idea--
I'll deal with you later.

972
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:12,899
Scour these premises.

973
01:07:15,102 --> 01:07:16,970
Jebediah.

974
01:07:16,972 --> 01:07:18,471
Jebediah, i--
don't.

975
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:20,373
They would've come
even if I hadn't called.

976
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:22,008
What do they know?

977
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,677
I told them everything. I didn't
think they would believe me.

978
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:26,813
We'll deal with
this later. Get ready.

979
01:07:31,285 --> 01:07:33,553
Check the door.

980
01:08:07,454 --> 01:08:09,489
Turn around right now.
Un-cuff him.

981
01:08:09,491 --> 01:08:11,391
Don't do this.

982
01:08:11,393 --> 01:08:13,860
Un-cuff him right now.

983
01:08:29,977 --> 01:08:32,011
Hold it.
You idiot.

984
01:08:32,013 --> 01:08:34,847
We have to go now. Now.

985
01:08:36,517 --> 01:08:38,484
Get in the damn car.

986
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:27,367
You're fucking dead.

987
01:09:27,369 --> 01:09:28,968
She's got the gun, smartass.

988
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:32,238
What was that?
It was exactly what I told you.

989
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,840
No, that can't be.

990
01:09:33,842 --> 01:09:35,875
There must be some kind of--
there isn't.

991
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:37,944
We need you
to cooperate with us now.

992
01:09:37,946 --> 01:09:39,612
You wouldn't touch me.

993
01:09:39,614 --> 01:09:41,314
Without my testimony,

994
01:09:41,316 --> 01:09:44,117
you're both gonna be on the hook
for that bloodbath there.

995
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:46,119
Testimony? I don't
think you understand

996
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:47,587
the time frame
we're on here.

997
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:50,757
I have been shot.
I'm wounded.

998
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:52,959
First we're gonna get me
medical attention.

999
01:09:52,961 --> 01:09:56,095
Then we'll talk about
what happened back there.

1000
01:09:57,999 --> 01:09:59,699
Please, okay, okay.

1001
01:09:59,701 --> 01:10:02,435
What happened
while we were outside?

1002
01:10:02,437 --> 01:10:04,737
The little girl,

1003
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:06,706
she came out
of the back room.

1004
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:08,808
She-- she attacked--

1005
01:10:10,345 --> 01:10:12,011
she killed three of my men.

1006
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,615
We fired on her.

1007
01:10:15,617 --> 01:10:18,284
And then one
of my guys fired on me,

1008
01:10:18,286 --> 01:10:19,585
clipped me
in the shoulder. Ow!

1009
01:10:19,587 --> 01:10:21,421
Then what happened?

1010
01:10:21,423 --> 01:10:25,057
I fired on him,
and then I ran.

1011
01:10:26,727 --> 01:10:29,061
Fuck you both.
You'd have run too.

1012
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:30,396
Okay.
Did you hit him?

1013
01:10:30,398 --> 01:10:33,966
Yeah. Yes,
but it wasn't a kill-shot.

1014
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:36,669
Where'd you hit him?
Lower abdomen.

1015
01:10:36,671 --> 01:10:38,771
All right. Cuff him now.

1016
01:10:38,773 --> 01:10:41,574
What? What is this?
Wait a minute.

1017
01:10:41,576 --> 01:10:45,344
What the fuck are you doing?
I am with you, okay?

1018
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:47,313
You're both
fucking crazy.

1019
01:10:47,315 --> 01:10:53,319
Clearly, there's something
very unnatural going on here.

1020
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:55,755
Why don't we get in the car,
drive back,

1021
01:10:55,757 --> 01:10:57,824
I'll explain everything,
all will be forgiven.

1022
01:10:57,826 --> 01:10:59,425
I don't think
we have time for that.

1023
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:02,261
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1024
01:11:02,263 --> 01:11:04,864
Ahh!

1025
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:28,721
I'll do it.
I'll fucking do it.

1026
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:59,185
Agent Pierce.

1027
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:15,835
I'm sorry, jebediah.

1028
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:18,070
Trust me,
if it weren't for me,

1029
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,939
those men back there
would still be alive.

1030
01:12:19,941 --> 01:12:22,008
Well,
you should've told me.

1031
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:24,110
Let's just be clear
with each other from now on.

1032
01:12:24,112 --> 01:12:27,146
What are we
gonna do with him?

1033
01:12:27,148 --> 01:12:31,551
Well, we're just gonna find
a suitable place and end this.

1034
01:12:31,553 --> 01:12:33,252
And who's
gonna kill it?

1035
01:12:33,254 --> 01:12:36,556
Yeah. Well, I'm just gonna
have to figure something out.

1036
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,975
It doesn't have to be like this.

1037
01:12:55,977 --> 01:12:58,110
We can keep going.
We can find another way.

1038
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:02,248
There is no other way. Someone
has to die. That's the rules.

1039
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,451
Yeah, but you're--
you're important. You're--

1040
01:13:05,453 --> 01:13:08,187
why am I important?

1041
01:13:08,189 --> 01:13:09,822
Because I kill demons?

1042
01:13:09,824 --> 01:13:11,724
Should you wanna die
instead of me?

1043
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:15,328
Would I like for this
to be someone else?

1044
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:17,597
You bet your ass.

1045
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:20,066
But you're different.

1046
01:13:20,068 --> 01:13:23,569
You got that power inside of you
that you have to harness.

1047
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:25,204
You're important.

1048
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:28,341
Hell of a lot more important
than I am in this fight.

1049
01:13:30,978 --> 01:13:32,712
Let's get
this over with.

1050
01:13:42,556 --> 01:13:45,424
It's got one bullet.

1051
01:13:45,426 --> 01:13:47,193
All right.

1052
01:14:06,613 --> 01:14:08,848
Take care of my car.

1053
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:22,028
Stop.

1054
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,896
Damn it,
what's with this guy?

1055
01:14:23,898 --> 01:14:27,833
What in the name of god
are you doing to this poor man?

1056
01:14:27,835 --> 01:14:29,468
Padre,
you're gonna have to stop.

1057
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:31,137
Don't take another step.

1058
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:34,774
Pastor Erikson, you need
to leave. You don't know--

1059
01:14:34,776 --> 01:14:36,876
and I do not wish to know.

1060
01:14:36,878 --> 01:14:40,379
Free this man.
Wait. Don't do it.

1061
01:14:40,381 --> 01:14:41,714
Restrain him.

1062
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:47,720
Get off me.

1063
01:14:47,722 --> 01:14:49,088
What are you doing?

1064
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,557
Think about it.
You saw the demon. You saw it.

1065
01:14:51,559 --> 01:14:54,160
- You shut your mouth.
- You saw the demon.

1066
01:14:54,162 --> 01:14:56,195
You will not poison me.

1067
01:14:56,197 --> 01:15:00,232
I'm trying to help you, pastor.
What are you gonna do, kill me?

1068
01:15:48,148 --> 01:15:50,649
Be gone, devil.

1069
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:06,332
Get away from me.

1070
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:19,145
There's no chance.

1071
01:16:19,147 --> 01:16:21,313
There's no fucking chance.

1072
01:16:23,717 --> 01:16:25,351
You heard the lady.

1073
01:16:38,398 --> 01:16:40,533
Oh, you sick fucker.

1074
01:17:03,657 --> 01:17:05,157
Evelyn, don't do it.

1075
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,094
Don't kill it.

1076
01:19:43,883 --> 01:19:46,752
I've been doing
 this a long time.

1077
01:19:46,754 --> 01:19:49,054
I can't tell you
 if there's a heaven or hell,

1078
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:50,856
or what's out there.

1079
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:53,158
But one thing I can
 tell you for certain

1080
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,161
is that evil exists.

1081
01:19:57,497 --> 01:20:00,566
You can run away from it,
 you can bury it,

1082
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:03,902
maybe you can
 even slow it down,

1083
01:20:03,904 --> 01:20:05,504
but you can't stop it.

1084
01:20:05,506 --> 01:20:09,842
Sooner or later, maybe
 not even in your lifetime,

1085
01:20:09,844 --> 01:20:12,878
that evil will be back.
