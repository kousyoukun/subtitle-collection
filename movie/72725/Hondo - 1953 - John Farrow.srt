1
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:50,121
Hey, Mama. Mom! Look at that.

2
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:52,778
Look, Mommy, look.

3
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:03,683
Johnny!

4
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,823
Now you let Mommy do the talking.
Remember.

5
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:28,291
Yes, Mom.

6
00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:33,956
But he has no horse.

7
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,556
No talking.

8
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:56,456
Good morning.

9
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,008
- You look like you've had trouble.
- Yep.

10
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:02,311
I lost my horse a few days ago
getting away from some Indians.

11
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,426
Indians?

12
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:06,566
We made dry camp last night
above the Ilano.

13
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:10,695
Sam here smelled more Apaches,
nuzzled me up.

14
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:12,802
So I thought I'd put some miles between us.

15
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:14,849
But why? We're at peace with the Apache.

16
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:16,548
- We have a treaty.
- Yes, ma'am.

17
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:19,913
Now I got to get me a new horse,
borrow or buy one.

18
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:24,134
I can pay you in United States script.
I'm riding a dispatch for General Crook.

19
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,433
- My name's Lane.
- I'm Mrs. Lowe.

20
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:28,966
I'm Johnny.

21
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,946
- The water sure looks inviting.
- Well, help yourself.

22
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,800
Watch out for that dog, son.

23
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:37,322
Could you hire me or sell me a horse,
Mrs. Lowe?

24
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:41,380
Of course. I've only got plow horses,
and two that are only half-broken.

25
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,191
The hand that was breaking them for me
got hurt and had to go to town.

26
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:49,770
- You mean you're staying here alone?
- Oh, no.

27
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,230
No, my husband is up in the hills...

28
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:54,273
- working some cattle.
- Oh.

29
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,511
He would pick today to be away,
when we have a visitor.

30
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,496
I'd enjoy meeting him, ma'am.

31
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:05,605
I wouldn't touch that dog, son.
He don't take to petting.

32
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,930
And now if you'll allow, ma'am,
I'll take a look at those horses.

33
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:12,678
Of course.
You'll find a saddle over by the barn.

34
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,451
In the meantime, I'll fix you something
to eat. I imagine you're hungry.

35
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,116
I could eat. Thank you.

36
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,101
I'm so sorry my husband had to pick today
to go hunting those lost calves.

37
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,899
He would have enjoyed
having a man to talk to.

38
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,430
We welcome visitors.

39
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,138
Must be right Ionely around here.
Especially for a woman.

40
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,315
I don't mind. I was raised here.

41
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:17,225
- What can I feed your dog?
- Nothing, thanks.

42
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,931
He makes out by himself.
Can outrun any rabbit in the territory.

43
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,858
It's no trouble at all.

44
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:28,162
If you don't mind, ma'am,
I'd rather you didn't feed him.

45
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,355
I see. You don't want him to get in the habit
of taking food from anyone else.

46
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,248
Well, you can hand it to him.

47
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,314
No, ma'am, I don't feed him, either.
Sam's independent.

48
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,354
He doesn't need anybody.
I want him to stay that way.

49
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:42,920
It's a good way.

50
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,621
- Everyone needs someone.
- Yes, ma'am. Most everyone.

51
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,032
Too bad, isn't it?

52
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:51,338
- You're a good cook, ma'am.
- Thank you.

53
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,697
A woman should be a good cook.
Good cook myself.

54
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,626
Why didn't you get on him
when he was stuck?

55
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:27,072
'Cause I didn't want him sitting on me
from a standing start.

56
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:28,777
Stay with him.

57
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,259
You chose the most savage one.

58
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,214
I won't give you an argument there.

59
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:07,744
He's always been a fighter.

60
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:10,851
I wouldn't give a plugged nickel
for a horse that wouldn't fight.

61
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:13,322
It lets you down when the going gets tough.

62
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:15,881
It's a little dull.

63
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,729
Well, I can do almost everything
around a ranch, but I never could...

64
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:20,586
put an edge on an axe.

65
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:21,763
Where is it?

66
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:24,196
- What?
- The grindstone.

67
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,601
This ranch looks like it's been here
a little while.

68
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,015
Yes, I was born here.
My husband was raised here, too.

69
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:46,856
He's an orphan. His parents got killed
in a wagon-train massacre...

70
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:48,581
so my father took him in.

71
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,106
- Handy.
- What do you mean?

72
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,528
Well, it seems the figures are against it.

73
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:58,218
Only young fellow in 1,000 square miles...

74
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,734
only young girl in 1,000 square miles.

75
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:06,060
They get in a whirl over each other.
That's what I meant. Handy.

76
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,612
I guess it was quite a coincidence.

77
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:13,475
But they say that the right two people are
going to meet by an arrangement of destiny.

78
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,783
You believe that, Mrs. Lowe?

79
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:18,721
- Yes, I do.
- Interesting.

80
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:31,074
Always sink a blade into a log, son.
Keeps the edge clean.

81
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:35,203
Well, I guess I'd better quit stalling
and get back to that horse.

82
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,933
And can I play with Sam now?

83
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,431
I've told you twice not to.

84
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:41,440
But you do what you wanna do.

85
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,016
Really, Mr. Lane, if you knew
the dog would bite, I should think...

86
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:58,596
Mrs. Lowe, people learn by getting bit.
Youngster just learned.

87
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:01,219
Johnny.

88
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:08,642
Don't you ever touch that dog again!
Now go in and take your nap.

89
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:50,820
While I'm at it, I'll shoe those plow horses.

90
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:53,990
Thank you very much.
They do need a shoeing, I guess.

91
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,236
They do.

92
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:59,592
I guess my husband's having a hard time
finding those strayed calves.

93
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,125
I guess he is.

94
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:04,298
Perhaps he won't be home
until late tonight...

95
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,802
or he may even camp in the hills
and come in tomorrow after you're gone.

96
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:13,066
He'll be so sorry to have missed
one of our very few occasional visitors.

97
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:17,861
I guess I'll go and look after Johnny.

98
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,945
Mrs. Lowe, you're a liar.

99
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,873
- And an almighty poor liar.
- I don't understand you.

100
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:26,694
These horses haven't been shod
in a couple of months.

101
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:29,762
It's a cinch that axe hasn't had
an edge on it in two months.

102
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:33,544
And your tea can, a five-pound tea can
in your house is empty.

103
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,005
Your husband's been gone a long time.

104
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:38,758
Now, look here, Mr. Lane,
I don't think you have any right to...

105
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:41,379
I'm not talking about rights.
I'm talking about lies.

106
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:43,271
Why did you lie to me, Mrs. Lowe?

107
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:47,168
Were you afraid that maybe you wouldn't be
safe here with me with your husband away?

108
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,992
- That it?
- That's partly it.

109
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:53,313
Women always figure every man
comes along wants them.

110
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:50,791
- Mr. Lane.
- Yes, ma'am?

111
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:53,664
You're right. I was lying.
My husband is overdue.

112
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:55,178
He should have been home long ago.

113
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:57,031
Figure Apaches killed him?

114
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,749
Of course not.
There are a hundred possible explanations.

115
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,312
Indians are one of them.

116
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:03,655
But we're at peace with the Apache,
except for a few...

117
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,445
Mrs. Lowe, if you've got good sense...

118
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:08,329
you'll pack up you and that boy of yours
and come out with me.

119
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,729
There's trouble brewing
in the Apache lodges.

120
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:13,445
Vittorio, their main chief,
called a war council.

121
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:16,165
A full report of it is in that dispatch
I'm carrying.

122
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:20,041
But you don't know, we've always
gotten along splendidly with the Apache.

123
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,266
They drink and bring their horses
to our spring...

124
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,607
on their way north to the buffalo hunt.

125
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,925
I've never seen the great Vittorio,
but there've been plenty of Apaches here.

126
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,499
I've seen the great Vittorio,
before the treaty.

127
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:40,803
His horse had 40 scalps hung in its mane.

128
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,598
That was before the treaty.

129
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:46,024
We broke that treaty, us Whites.

130
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:50,339
There's no word in the Apache language
for lie, and they've been lied to.

131
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,489
If they rise, there won't be...

132
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:55,489
- a White left in the territory.
- They won't bother me.

133
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:58,310
Us, I mean. We always got along very well.

134
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:01,828
People I know, man and his wife,
got along real well for...

135
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,490
20 years. Then one day...

136
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,012
she upped and blew a hole in him...

137
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:09,570
big enough to drive a stagecoach through.

138
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,644
She got mad. The Apaches are mad.

139
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,080
Well, I have nothing to worry about,
I'm sure.

140
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,209
Nice to be sure.

141
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:22,729
Get out of the way.

142
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:26,310
- Strange dog you have.
- I don't have him.

143
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:29,578
- The two of you are together.
- He stays with me.

144
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:34,343
- He can smell an Indian at a half a mile.
- He smells Indians? I don't believe it.

145
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:37,222
Sure, lots of dogs smell Indians.
You can teach them.

146
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:38,599
Teach them? How?

147
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,186
First you get yourself a puppy and then...

148
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,769
you hire yourself a tame Indian
and cut a willow switch.

149
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,500
Then you get the Indian to beat the puppy...

150
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:48,807
with a willow switch four or five times
a day.

151
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:52,551
And when he grows up,
he'll always signal when he smells an Indian.

152
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,822
Beat a puppy. How cruel.

153
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:56,804
That's the way they do it.

154
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:59,175
Anyway, I don't believe
a dog can smell Indians.

155
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:01,347
I mean, as different from anyone else.

156
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:03,174
- You or me, for instance.
- Well, they can.

157
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,282
As a matter of fact,
Indians can smell White people.

158
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,591
- I don't believe it.
- Well, it's true.

159
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:12,293
I'm part Indian, and I can smell you
when I'm downwind of you.

160
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:19,082
- That's impossible.
- No, it isn't impossible, Mrs. Lowe.

161
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,816
You baked today.
I can smell fresh bread on you.

162
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,560
Sometime today you cooked with salt pork.

163
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:36,709
Smell that on you, too.

164
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:39,591
You smell all over like soap.

165
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:43,331
You took a bath. And on top of that,
you smell all over like a woman.

166
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:48,805
I could find you in the dark, Mrs. Lowe,
and I'm only part Indian.

167
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,308
Mrs. Lowe.

168
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:35,080
What do you want?

169
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:38,851
- I watered and grained the stock.
- Thank you.

170
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,929
I'll bed down near here someplace tonight.

171
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:45,539
Mr. Lane?

172
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:53,410
You can't sleep outside,
there's a storm coming.

173
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:55,913
I've fixed a pallet for you in the corner.

174
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:06,016
It would be uncivilized
to let anyone sleep outside...

175
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,489
and after all, we are civilized, aren't we?

176
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:11,041
Speaking for you, of course. But me?

177
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:13,892
I guess you could call me civilized.

178
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:20,291
That's your bed.
I'm sorry it has to be on the floor.

179
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:26,693
I have to set the batter for the morning.
I hope the noise won't disturb you.

180
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,261
It won't.

181
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:32,681
Good night, ma'am.

182
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:55,592
Put that gun down.

183
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:01,504
You're Hondo Lane, the gunman.

184
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,091
- I carry a gun.
- Don't come any nearer.

185
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,974
You killed three men in a gunfight last year.

186
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:10,441
- We heard about it. Three men.
- Yes, ma'am.

187
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:13,317
- Just as quick as I could.
- Don't come any nearer.

188
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:18,408
It's not a very good idea
to point one of these things at anybody...

189
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,896
with an empty chamber under the firing pin.

190
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:22,951
You can see it plain as day.

191
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,731
I keep it that way because of Johnny.

192
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:27,527
Well, now it's loaded.

193
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,821
Keep it that way, and keep it high.

194
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,967
Please stay. I really want you to.

195
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:50,180
I'm sorry. I should have realized from
the beginning that you are a gentleman.

196
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:58,600
Civilized? Gentleman?

197
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:02,309
Well, a lot for one day.

198
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:09,351
Night, ma'am.

199
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,886
Morning. Getting an early start.

200
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:34,786
Be sure and tell that little man
goodbye for me.

201
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:37,257
I ought to wake him to say goodbye to you.

202
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,328
Was it me, I'd let him sleep.

203
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:42,730
Youngsters grow sleeping,
but you do what you want to.

204
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:46,281
He was so delighted with that whistle
you made for him.

205
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:50,274
Glad to hear it. He and I got along just fine.

206
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:54,401
It's more like a flute than a whistle.
It ranges almost the full scale.

207
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,764
I learned to make them when I was
living with the Mescalero.

208
00:18:57,866 --> 00:19:00,714
My squaw used to make them
for every kid in the lodge.

209
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:04,805
- You lived with the Apache?
- Five years.

210
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:08,612
- And you had an Indian wife?
- Wife, squaw<i>...</i>

211
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:13,289
I took the liberty of borrowing a few feet
of rope off of that coil in the lean-to.

212
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,901
- Gladly pay you for it, if you let me.
- 'Course not.

213
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,617
The hills are so beautiful today.

214
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,919
Odd how clear they always are
after a dust storm.

215
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,967
Must have been very interesting
living with the Apache.

216
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:30,502
I liked it.

217
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,840
- This Indian wife you have<i>...</i>
- Had. She's dead.

218
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:39,137
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up
an unhappy memory.

219
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,314
I can't remember anything unhappy
about Destarte.

220
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:51,040
Destarte? How musical. What does it mean?

221
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:56,970
You can't say it except in Mescalero.
It means morning.

222
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,291
But that isn't what it means, either.

223
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,777
Means more than just that.
Indian words mean the sound and...

224
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:06,852
feel of a word, like...

225
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:10,408
crack of dawn, the first bronze light...

226
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:13,922
that makes the buttes stand out
against the gray desert.

227
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,902
The first sound you hear of a brook...

228
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:19,587
curling over some rocks, with trout jumping.

229
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:23,649
It's like when you get up in the first light...

230
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:28,102
just you and her and you go out of
a wickiup.

231
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:33,317
Where it smells kind of smoky and private,
just you and her, and...

232
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:36,485
kind of safe with just the two of you.

233
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:39,049
Stand outside and...

234
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,011
feel the bite of the first wind
coming down from the high divide...

235
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:45,572
that promises snowfall.

236
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:51,106
Can't say it in English,
but that was her name.

237
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:53,539
Destarte.

238
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:59,776
- You remind me of her some.
- Of an Indian girl?

239
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:01,696
Was she fair?

240
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:04,232
Her hair was black as 10 feet down.

241
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,912
Did you ever see a crow's wing,
how black and gleaming it is?

242
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,115
- Yes.
- That's the way her hair shined.

243
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,897
I'd like to pay you for that rope.

244
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:15,905
Riding dispatch,
I have the right to give U.S. Script.

245
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:19,967
- You loved her?
- I don't know.

246
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:22,502
I needed her.

247
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:30,371
- But if she was dark and I'm fair...
- Why you reminded me of her?

248
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,743
- Yes.
- I don't know.

249
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,069
I thought about it.
You don't look anything like her.

250
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:39,557
I am fully aware
that I am a homely woman, Mr. Lane.

251
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:41,087
I didn't mean that.

252
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:44,456
I have a bad habit of telling the truth.
But being pretty isn't much.

253
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,464
I know a lot of pretty people
I wouldn't trust...

254
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,577
with a busted nickel-plated watch.

255
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:51,779
But some others, something comes out of
the inside of them and...

256
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,118
you know you can trust them.

257
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:56,325
Destarte had that.

258
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:59,337
And you've got it, too.

259
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,666
- I'm a married woman.
- I thought about that, too.

260
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,894
I guess I kissed you
because you remind me of Destarte.

261
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,099
Or maybe it was because
I hate to think of your hair...

262
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:14,624
hanging from the center pole
of an Apache wickiup.

263
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:18,088
Well, a long time ago I made me a rule.

264
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,222
I let people do what they want to do.

265
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:25,513
Sam!

266
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:33,954
You are a strange man, Mr. Lane.

267
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,961
I don't know about that.
Goodbye, Mrs. Lowe.

268
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,311
- You are Vittorio.
- I am Vittorio.

269
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,509
Your horses have been watered here.

270
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:56,874
- You were told to go.
- I couldn't leave.

271
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,290
My husband is away,
and I didn't think that I<i>...</i>

272
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:07,109
Your people water their horses here.

273
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:12,934
You leave my mother alone.

274
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,182
Stop him! Stop him!

275
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:07,041
- I ain't scared of you.
- You're not fear Apache?

276
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,271
No.

277
00:25:11,658 --> 00:25:15,302
He fear hurt to mother, but not that to self.

278
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,618
He brave. Like Apache boy.

279
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:30,688
Him now blood brother.
I call him Small Warrior.

280
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:33,379
Him belong Moon Dog Lodge,
Chiricahua Apache.

281
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:37,224
You care for him well.
You now mother Chiricahua warrior.

282
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:38,847
Live safely here.

283
00:25:41,418 --> 00:25:44,484
I hope someday,
someone befriends your sons.

284
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:47,782
My sons are dead. White man kill them.

285
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:22,152
Figured your scalp would be hanging
in some Apache wickiup by now.

286
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,771
- Hi, Buffalo.
- Been making bets on it.

287
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:28,551
- You're sure a disappointment to me, Hondo.
- You like to win your bet.

288
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,563
I wore out some horses.

289
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:33,632
You wore out you while you was at it.
Here, let me get that.

290
00:27:33,738 --> 00:27:36,520
Where's that water?

291
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:42,663
- Looks like I won a bet, Buffalo.
- Hi, Dick.

292
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,835
Yeah, I owe you a jug of red-eye.

293
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:49,346
- This feels good.
- There's times when water is good.

294
00:27:54,793 --> 00:27:56,288
That's exactly what I mean.

295
00:27:56,394 --> 00:27:58,663
I say I got a right to talk to
this here bow-necked Major...

296
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,064
- I don't talk to no underlings.
- Major's asleep.

297
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:03,845
That's just too bad about him.
I'm a citizen and I want to see him.

298
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:05,953
Major ain't had any sleep for three days.

299
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,197
I can tell you everything
just as well as he can.

300
00:28:08,298 --> 00:28:10,632
We ain't heard nothing from up north.

301
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:14,501
If you ask me, the Cavalry's scared of
Vittorio. I think the U.S. Cavalry...

302
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:18,049
I am greatly interested in your opinion of
the United States Cavalry.

303
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,292
Continue, Mr<i>...</i> Whatever your name is.

304
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:22,753
The Cavalry is supposed to support
the settlers.

305
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:24,516
I've got some cattle up north,
I don't intend...

306
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:28,163
C troop is making a sweep to the north
to escort out any settlers they may find.

307
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:32,995
C troop is now over a week late
in returning. That's all I can tell you.

308
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,079
C troop isn't coming back.

309
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:45,411
I'd be obliged, sir, if you would leave.

310
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:46,976
A fine business, the whole territory...

311
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:48,391
- Sergeant!
- Get!

312
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:56,833
Get out of the way, you mangy<i>...</i>

313
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,241
- lf that's your cur, get him out of the way.
- Walk around him.

314
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:06,471
I'll be hanged if I go out of my way
for any cur dog.

315
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,480
A man ought to do what he thinks is best.

316
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:23,976
Quit blocking the door.

317
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:29,440
Where did you get this?

318
00:29:30,122 --> 00:29:32,610
- Half a day's ride south of Twin Buttes.
- How?

319
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,177
Took it off a couple of Indians, Apaches.

320
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,507
Running Dog Lodge of the Mescaleros.

321
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:40,769
Mescaleros are up, too.
That makes all the Apache lodges.

322
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:45,478
Say, while I was south, did any settlers
get in from the north basin?

323
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:46,920
A few, the last couple of weeks.

324
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:49,887
Handsome woman, fair,
with a boy about six?

325
00:29:49,993 --> 00:29:52,328
No, mostly middle-aged or elderly people.

326
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,943
Get some sleep, Lane, use my tent.

327
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,289
Thank you.

328
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:08,193
While you're sleeping,
I'll move your possibles over to my tent.

329
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:12,262
Pete Britton was scouting with C troop.

330
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,350
Wintered with old Pete once
up on the Divide. Ornery cuss.

331
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:20,360
Them indians you took that pennant offen.

332
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,312
- Dead Indians?
- Finally.

333
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:38,694
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi, Hondo.

334
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:40,832
Broke my heart when I heard you made it.

335
00:30:40,937 --> 00:30:43,970
Your pap know you started out
against this so-called whiskey?

336
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:45,382
I ain't seen him for a month.

337
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,586
I know you haven't. Come here,
I got a message for you.

338
00:30:47,688 --> 00:30:50,077
Leave him be, Hondo,
I can't make no money scouting.

339
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:52,606
Aw, these other fellows'll excuse you.
Come on over at the bar.

340
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:56,357
I won't. I'm out almost $100.

341
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,874
- That figures, with Buffalo in the game.
- Wait a minute.

342
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:02,688
These shirts are hard to come by.

343
00:31:08,104 --> 00:31:10,341
- What'd you hit me for?
- 'Cause I know you.

344
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,553
Leather it.

345
00:31:14,057 --> 00:31:15,748
No, don't leather it.

346
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,887
No wonder them Apaches
call him <i>Emberato.</i>

347
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,872
- What does it mean?
- Bad temper.

348
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,294
I should've let him shoot you.

349
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:39,997
That's the second time I've tangled with
that mouthy no-good<i>...</i>

350
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:43,813
- What's his name?
- Calls himself Lowe, Ed Lowe.

351
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,009
Johnny.

352
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:02,594
Johnny!

353
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:15,812
Mommy.

354
00:32:19,944 --> 00:32:23,140
Hi, Mommy.
Vittorio says I'll make a good Apache.

355
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:27,298
I thought<i>...</i> I didn't know he was with you,
I didn't hear anything.

356
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:30,210
- Apache no make noise.
- Look what he gave me.

357
00:32:30,312 --> 00:32:33,541
- It is lodge token. His.
- It's very pretty, thank you.

358
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,495
He will ride well.

359
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,917
And he no afraid.

360
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:41,831
- I speak with your mother, go to house.
- Yes, Vittorio.

361
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:46,817
Lodge should have man.

362
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,946
- My husband will be home any day now.
- I no think so.

363
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:52,831
I think he dead.

364
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:01,663
Small Warrior should have father.

365
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:17,569
See, Sergeant, just like I told you.

366
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:21,221
That's my horse, all right.
Got my brand on it: "E.L." Ed Lowe.

367
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:22,782
What he says true?

368
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:25,376
- Yeah, that's his horse.
- Where'd you get him?

369
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:28,546
From his ranch,
that's where I'm taking him back.

370
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:30,630
That's where he can pick him up.

371
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:33,827
But that's Indian territory, strict orders
against any Whites going in there.

372
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:37,856
You know something, Joe, I got a bad ear.
I can't hear a thing you're saying.

373
00:33:46,248 --> 00:33:48,103
Aren't you gonna prefer charges
against him?

374
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,656
He may be a mean, ornery,
son-of-anything-you-wanna-call-him...

375
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,254
but he ain't no horse thief.

376
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,295
And I'm not gonna call him one,
to his face or his back.

377
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,247
You stay here.

378
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:26,691
I thought the Apache were always silent.

379
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:30,333
Not when they seek squaw. You pick one.

380
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:31,840
What?

381
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:33,701
It's not good for Small Warrior...

382
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,483
to be without father
to teach him how to be man.

383
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,582
This is the one I was calling Emiliano.

384
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:43,398
Very brave, has taken many scalps.

385
00:34:44,104 --> 00:34:48,359
He has six horses, and two squaws,
but one old and will soon die.

386
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:52,741
He's good hunter.

387
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:54,722
Never hungry, his wickiup.

388
00:34:56,648 --> 00:34:58,787
This is one who is called Kloori.

389
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:03,456
He has ten horses, one squaw.

390
00:35:05,128 --> 00:35:07,943
Sachito, brave warrior, many horses.

391
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:13,122
Not much beat squaws, sings very loud.

392
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:25,152
- Boy, go stand by my horse.
- Yes, Vittorio.

393
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:31,712
Small Warrior never to see tears,
Apache does not weep.

394
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:34,978
Chief, you can't make me do this,
I'm married.

395
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,316
You are fool, your man dead.

396
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:41,223
Soon come planting rain.
If your man come home by then, good.

397
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:43,368
If not, you take Apache brave.

398
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:54,054
Remember, time of planting rain.

399
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,885
He's getting kind of deep
into Indian territory.

400
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:08,162
And so are we.

401
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:11,427
What are you squawking for?
You're getting well paid.

402
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:16,003
He'll be making camp pretty soon. Don't
get a chance at him then, we'll turn back.

403
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,429
Quiet, Sam, I hear them.

404
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,069
Come on, Sam.

405
00:37:09,672 --> 00:37:11,363
That's his camp, all right.

406
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:24,579
Rifle's gone,
must be out looking for camp meat.

407
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:07,584
- You're all right, you're not hurt bad.
- This tintype saved me.

408
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:17,158
That did it.

409
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:20,835
Now, every Apache between us
and the ranch will be alerted.

410
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:23,489
They'll have us cut off.

411
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:26,531
No, there's nobody between us
and Fort Seddon.

412
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,373
Beat it, Sam!

413
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:47,586
- White man understand Apache.
- A little.

414
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,862
He know now how he die.

415
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,389
Your coup stick shows many scalps.

416
00:42:52,648 --> 00:42:55,648
Yes, many. Soon, you.

417
00:42:55,816 --> 00:42:57,223
Man's scalp would look out of place there.

418
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,451
You took all yours from squaws,
papoose, and dogs.

419
00:43:02,856 --> 00:43:05,441
Your lodge should be real proud of you.

420
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:16,647
You will take long time die.

421
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,535
Where are soldiers, White man?

422
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:40,933
- How many?
- I don't know, Vittorio.

423
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:42,309
You know my name?

424
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:45,539
I saw you once at the Treaty Council
at Fort Meade.

425
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:46,687
The treaty.

426
00:43:55,784 --> 00:43:58,751
The treaty was like rustle of wind
to White man.

427
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:03,559
- Now you tell, where are soldiers?
- This, I do not know.

428
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:06,659
- Hat. Soldier hat.
- I was once a soldier.

429
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:08,767
Why you here Apache land?

430
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:11,298
This is for me to know.

431
00:44:43,304 --> 00:44:46,467
I'm told you speak insults
to this one of my chiefs.

432
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:52,380
The cougar screams insults and is brave.

433
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:56,737
A coyote howls insults and is a coward.

434
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,535
We shall see.

435
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:01,503
Cougar or coyote.

436
00:45:02,439 --> 00:45:04,447
You will die bravely in silence...

437
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:07,773
or you will wail
like woman bringing forth child...

438
00:45:08,232 --> 00:45:10,621
and cry out to us where pony-soldiers are.

439
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:01,857
He claims the blood right, you understand?

440
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:04,703
You mean, he says I shot his brother?

441
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:07,904
I understand.

442
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,775
So that life may ebb cleanly.

443
00:47:44,391 --> 00:47:47,588
Forget your blood right or join your brother.

444
00:48:07,816 --> 00:48:09,725
You think you buy your life now?

445
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:11,876
I don't think.

446
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,845
You may live or die, we see.

447
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,985
Indians.

448
00:49:29,352 --> 00:49:30,661
Is this your man?

449
00:49:31,111 --> 00:49:33,533
Speak, is this your man?

450
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,218
- Yes, this is my husband.
- White man...

451
00:49:40,008 --> 00:49:42,342
you lived with the Apache, that's good.

452
00:49:42,888 --> 00:49:44,797
You know how Small Warrior
should be taught that...

453
00:49:44,903 --> 00:49:47,969
he be honored son of wickiup
of one who's called Vittorio.

454
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:51,300
Watch like the hawk,
be patient as the beaver...

455
00:49:51,496 --> 00:49:53,917
brave as puma, that he may learn well.

456
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:55,587
Know it, then...

457
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:59,173
or your dying will be long before
you welcome death.

458
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:12,999
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

459
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:19,398
- What are you gonna do?
- Gonna fix up your shirt.

460
00:51:20,168 --> 00:51:22,077
Not before I show you something.

461
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:32,286
- Did Ed give you this?
- I took it off his body.

462
00:51:33,352 --> 00:51:34,562
He's dead.

463
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:38,785
Tried to tell you before.

464
00:51:40,872 --> 00:51:42,530
Funny, I'm not surprised.

465
00:51:43,943 --> 00:51:47,042
Perhaps because I knew all along,
just wouldn't admit it to myself.

466
00:51:47,144 --> 00:51:49,762
- Hi, <i>Emberato,</i> you didn't die, did you?
- Hello, Johnny.

467
00:51:49,863 --> 00:51:50,846
Be careful.

468
00:51:50,951 --> 00:51:53,373
I wanna show you something, <i>Emberato.</i>
My Indian emblem.

469
00:51:53,479 --> 00:51:55,618
Vittorio gave it to me, didn't he, Mom?

470
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:02,979
- He's taken a great liking to Johnny.
- Probably saved your life and mine.

471
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,884
Indians place great value on male children.

472
00:52:06,151 --> 00:52:09,118
They also place a great value on dying well.

473
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:12,223
Did Ed die well?

474
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:14,820
I keep it under my pillow.

475
00:52:16,391 --> 00:52:17,504
He died well.

476
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:22,114
When Johnny's old enough,
when he has to be told...

477
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:24,766
it will make him proud.

478
00:52:25,288 --> 00:52:28,997
Here it is, <i>Emberato.</i> I'm a chief now.
Isn't it wonderful?

479
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:36,063
- Isn't it?
- Yes, Johnny.

480
00:53:10,407 --> 00:53:12,895
- Where's your mother?
- Picking watercress.

481
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:15,493
- Any luck?
- Not a bite this morning.

482
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,204
See where the sun is?

483
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:20,895
- Up there.
- Yeah, on the back of your neck.

484
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:22,526
You're casting a shadow.

485
00:53:22,631 --> 00:53:24,737
If you can see it, the fish can see it.

486
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:28,254
Always fish with the sun in your face.
The other bank's the place.

487
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:32,101
- That is, if you want my opinion.
- Gosh, <i>Emberato,</i> I want your opinion.

488
00:53:32,392 --> 00:53:33,886
But Mama won't let me go over there.

489
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:35,846
- Why not?
- I can't swim.

490
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:38,976
- You can't what?
- I can't swim.

491
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:40,900
- How old are you?
- Six.

492
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,349
- Help him, he can't swim.
- Time he learned. Everybody should swim.

493
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:01,029
Just reach out in front of you
and grab a handful of water.

494
00:54:01,127 --> 00:54:02,753
Pull it back towards you.

495
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:07,808
Not too fast. That's the way I learned.

496
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:15,777
- I did it, <i>Emberato,</i> I did it.
- Good.

497
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,430
- How will he get back?
- Swim.

498
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,061
Well, he might drown.

499
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:22,886
- Well, then, you go get him.
- I can't swim, either.

500
00:55:40,743 --> 00:55:42,172
Angie, there's...

501
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:46,079
something I've got to tell you.
I tried to tell you.

502
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:49,606
- And it isn't going to be easy.
- Then don't say it yet.

503
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:51,645
Just look at the moon.

504
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,423
How odd it looks in this quarter.

505
00:55:57,031 --> 00:56:00,643
When I was a child, my mother
used to tell me it was a teeter-totter.

506
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:05,091
You know, the tilted plank a child plays on.

507
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:08,326
I suppose the Indians have a word for it.

508
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:11,398
Yeah, <i>bermarga.</i> It's the planting moon.

509
00:56:11,495 --> 00:56:14,212
Indians won't plant their corn
unless the moon's like that.

510
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:16,799
You liked living with the Apache, didn't you?

511
00:56:17,383 --> 00:56:19,522
Angie, I've just got to tell you this.

512
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:21,661
I'm not much for lying.

513
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:24,352
The last time I was here,
before Vittorio brought me?

514
00:56:24,455 --> 00:56:25,382
Yes.

515
00:56:25,479 --> 00:56:28,992
I rode dispatch some after that,
then came to Seddon.

516
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:30,979
There was trouble.

517
00:56:31,879 --> 00:56:33,089
I killed a man.

518
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:39,489
Stay still. Somebody in those willows.

519
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:43,038
Don't shoot, White man.

520
00:56:51,623 --> 00:56:54,176
Small Warrior has knife. He sleeps with it.

521
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:56,446
- You were in the house?
- In house.

522
00:56:57,383 --> 00:57:00,863
Wickiup empty place without sons.
Mine empty wickiup.

523
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:05,279
You better tell that brave back at
the creek bank not to walk in the water.

524
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:07,554
I almost killed him a few minutes ago.

525
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:15,234
Almost threw a shot at him.

526
00:57:15,463 --> 00:57:17,635
He very young. Will learn.

527
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:20,383
- Lf he lives.
- You are Apache.

528
00:57:21,543 --> 00:57:24,226
Now, hear me, pony-soldiers are near.

529
00:57:24,743 --> 00:57:28,605
Soon will be fought remembered fight.
They will come here first.

530
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:32,547
- You will not go with them, White man.
- I will not.

531
00:57:32,871 --> 00:57:35,260
Leader of pony-soldiers will question you.

532
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:38,877
You will say you have seen Apache
trailing to the west.

533
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:41,542
This I won't do.

534
00:57:43,207 --> 00:57:45,379
- You will not?
- I will not.

535
00:57:47,879 --> 00:57:50,050
You have good man, treasure him.

536
00:57:57,959 --> 00:58:00,326
They're mounting up now
down by the butte.

537
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:02,147
I don't hear a thing.

538
00:58:02,407 --> 00:58:04,098
There's eight of them I'd say,
or maybe nine.

539
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:08,225
- There's something in those trees.
- That's a squirrel. Our talking woke him up.

540
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:10,945
He's put out. There's nine of them.

541
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:13,059
I love you.

542
00:58:15,527 --> 00:58:17,666
I suppose I shouldn't have said that...

543
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:19,742
with my husband dead so short a time.

544
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:24,102
I don't guess people's hearts
got anything to do with a calendar.

545
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:37,345
You were so wonderful,
refusing to lie for Vittorio.

546
00:58:38,087 --> 00:58:40,574
He was testing me. Indians hate lies.

547
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:44,222
And I guess I got to feel the same way...

548
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,102
but, once in a while a fella's got to...

549
00:58:47,303 --> 00:58:49,856
lie if it'll make it easier on someone else.

550
00:59:12,263 --> 00:59:14,467
Troop, halt!

551
00:59:17,575 --> 00:59:18,982
Prepare to dismount.

552
00:59:19,911 --> 00:59:21,220
Dismount!

553
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:36,188
Madam and sir, may I present myself?
Lt. McKay, Troop D, 8th cavalry.

554
00:59:36,295 --> 00:59:39,197
- Hi, Hondo, you old cabin robber.
- Hi, Buff.

555
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:41,158
Lieutenant, this here is Hondo Lane.

556
00:59:41,479 --> 00:59:44,610
He's scouted some
and ridden dispatch some for the cavalry.

557
00:59:44,934 --> 00:59:48,283
- I don't reckon I know this here lady.
- This is Ms. Lowe, Lieutenant.

558
00:59:48,391 --> 00:59:50,300
You people are lucky. Obviously, Vittorio...

559
00:59:50,407 --> 00:59:53,090
and his renegade band
just happened not to find this hidden valley.

560
00:59:53,191 --> 00:59:55,395
- Vittorio's been here lots.
- And you lived?

561
00:59:55,494 --> 00:59:57,120
One Ione man stood off Vittorio?

562
00:59:57,223 --> 01:00:00,289
No Ione man stands off the Apache.
He lets us live here.

563
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:03,228
There are almost 100 dead settlers
in the basin...

564
01:00:03,335 --> 01:00:05,222
scalped by this cowardly criminal.

565
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:08,188
Vittorio may be a criminal by the books,
I don't know.

566
01:00:08,326 --> 01:00:10,661
But if he's a coward,
it hasn't showed up yet.

567
01:00:10,759 --> 01:00:12,798
- Amen, brother.
- I must disagree with you, Mr. Lane.

568
01:00:12,903 --> 01:00:14,725
He's run before us for 200 miles.

569
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:17,506
Indians have a story
they tell their young ones...

570
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:21,246
about a hunter who chased a wild cat
until he caught it.

571
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,660
Then it was the other way around.

572
01:00:22,759 --> 01:00:24,930
The story goes back further than
the Indians.

573
01:00:25,031 --> 01:00:28,380
It's originally attributed
to the first Roman army to enter Tartary.

574
01:00:28,486 --> 01:00:30,013
The soldier caught a Tartar and yelled out.

575
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:32,453
The officer called back for him to come in
with his prisoner.

576
01:00:32,551 --> 01:00:34,787
And he replied, "The Tartar won't let me."

577
01:00:35,687 --> 01:00:37,542
That was one of the favorite stories
of Col. Mays...

578
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:39,264
who teaches cavalry tactics at the Point.

579
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:40,741
The story is world-wide.

580
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,043
How long have you been out of that school,
Lieutenant?

581
01:00:43,142 --> 01:00:44,735
Graduated class '69, sir.

582
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:46,396
This is '70, ain't it?

583
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:50,493
I just can't seem to keep up with the years.
I meant to get a calendar, but then I forget.

584
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:52,355
Say, who's President
of these United States now?

585
01:00:52,455 --> 01:00:53,437
Ulysses S. Grant.

586
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:56,641
You know, I voted once. I was down
in Independence around voting time.

587
01:00:56,743 --> 01:01:00,256
And a fellow come up to me and offered me
$2 if I'd vote for a man named Taylor.

588
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:01,788
And I was drinking<i>...</i>

589
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:04,797
drinking a little at the time. And I<i>...</i>
The $2 didn't last<i>...</i>

590
01:01:04,903 --> 01:01:08,067
Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Lane, my orders are
to make a sweep as far as Twin Buttes.

591
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:11,014
My men'll bivouac here tonight.
We'll go on to Twin Buttes tomorrow...

592
01:01:11,111 --> 01:01:13,500
return tomorrow night to escort you
and your boy out to safety.

593
01:01:13,606 --> 01:01:17,403
If you'll excuse me, madam, I must
see that my men are properly encamped.

594
01:01:21,447 --> 01:01:23,552
Very nice and very young.

595
01:01:23,687 --> 01:01:25,923
He for doggone sure is, ma'am.

596
01:01:26,023 --> 01:01:29,187
- How long you been out on this patrol?
- This is the 20th day.

597
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:32,483
We've rounded up about eight families
back there, that's all there are left.

598
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:34,558
We're gonna pick them up on the way out.

599
01:01:34,919 --> 01:01:36,610
There've been many a scalp took, Hondo.

600
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:38,882
- You know where Vittorio is, don't you?
- I do.

601
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:40,734
This boy Lieutenant's gonna get you killed.

602
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:43,326
Us scouts has got to get
these young officers educated.

603
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:45,820
Johnny, go in and set out the plates for me.

604
01:01:45,927 --> 01:01:48,032
Hondo, if your friend
would like to eat with us, Mr<i>...</i>

605
01:01:48,135 --> 01:01:50,175
Buffalo? Mr<i>...</i>

606
01:01:50,823 --> 01:01:53,278
I've known you for 8 or 10 years.
You must have a last name.

607
01:01:53,383 --> 01:01:56,001
Well, of course I got a last name,
what do you think I am?

608
01:01:56,102 --> 01:01:58,491
I know what you are,
but there's a lady present.

609
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:01,632
Mrs. Lowe, my name is Baker.
That's what it is, Buffalo Baker.

610
01:02:01,735 --> 01:02:04,484
Well, you may eat with us then, Mr. Baker,
and wash.

611
01:02:04,582 --> 01:02:07,811
There's a basin on the bench
and a towel on the jug, and soap.

612
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,422
You know, there is something
about this place<i>...</i>

613
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,534
- I know what it reminds me of.
- My ranch.

614
01:02:13,638 --> 01:02:14,816
In California.

615
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,820
I shot a deer right off your front porch
on a butte just like that.

616
01:02:17,926 --> 01:02:20,479
With a crick down below
and the mesas all spreading out.

617
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,012
Made me pack it back.

618
01:02:23,655 --> 01:02:27,102
- You have a place that looks like this?
- East of San Dimas.

619
01:02:27,782 --> 01:02:28,960
How wonderful.

620
01:02:33,094 --> 01:02:35,844
You're getting to where you kind of
take to that water.

621
01:02:35,943 --> 01:02:37,350
Every time I wash my face...

622
01:02:37,447 --> 01:02:40,545
I think of you and that night at Seddon's,
when you whacked me.

623
01:02:41,095 --> 01:02:44,095
You busted off a jaw tooth, and it got to
hurting so bad I had to go to...

624
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:46,086
the barber and have him dig out
the rest of it.

625
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:48,833
Did I catch you that day,
I'd have set your sun.

626
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:51,232
That's the last morning you'd ever seen.

627
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:54,084
"Hondo Lane, first prize, Winchester Arms."

628
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:58,461
Always liked this rifle of yours.
Always wanted one of the new issue myself.

629
01:02:58,758 --> 01:03:00,285
Keep your hands off it.

630
01:03:00,967 --> 01:03:03,749
I've known him 10 years, and he's never
spoken a friendly word to me.

631
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:06,051
- I don't like you.
- Figured that.

632
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,058
But now I figure is how he might admire
to give me that rifle.

633
01:03:10,343 --> 01:03:13,409
You see, about a half day out of Seddon,
I come across some bodies.

634
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:15,845
One of them was this here lady's husband.

635
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:18,886
There was a lot of horse tracks
around there.

636
01:03:18,983 --> 01:03:21,317
Some of them belonged
to that there chestnut you were riding.

637
01:03:21,415 --> 01:03:23,586
That one with the cast-off horseshoe.

638
01:03:24,422 --> 01:03:27,324
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice
little set-up you got yourself here.

639
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:29,700
Nice ranch. Pretty woman.

640
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:31,937
You could get yourself killed talking like this.

641
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:34,527
Or I could get that
new-fashioned Winchester...

642
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:36,932
since he bushwhacked this lady's husband.

643
01:03:37,031 --> 01:03:39,300
Did she know that,
I figure she wouldn't look at him like...

644
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:42,628
he was the high cockalorum of every tribe
from here to Salt Water.

645
01:03:43,622 --> 01:03:44,735
Hondo.

646
01:04:01,606 --> 01:04:03,068
I tried to tell you.

647
01:04:06,214 --> 01:04:08,156
Mrs. Lowe, we're ready to leave.

648
01:04:08,742 --> 01:04:09,757
Mr. Lane?

649
01:04:10,406 --> 01:04:11,748
- Stridon.
- Yes, sir.

650
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:14,335
- Form the troops, column of twos.
- Yes, sir.

651
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,822
I want you to accompany us
as far as Twin Buttes.

652
01:04:17,926 --> 01:04:20,348
Haven't any time to lose,
so I'd be obliged if you'd saddle up.

653
01:04:20,454 --> 01:04:22,210
- I'm not going.
- You're not going?

654
01:04:22,311 --> 01:04:23,805
- That's right.
- But why?

655
01:04:23,911 --> 01:04:25,437
- Gave my word.
- Your word to whom?

656
01:04:25,543 --> 01:04:27,430
- Vittorio.
- Surely a word given to an...

657
01:04:27,526 --> 01:04:30,843
- Indian desperado wouldn't be...
- Mister, when I give my word, I keep it.

658
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,445
Now I'll give you a piece of advice...

659
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:35,006
there's only one family
between here and Twin Buttes...

660
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,052
and you're too late to do them any good.

661
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:40,956
So you better gather up what settlers
you have and hightail it out of here.

662
01:04:41,062 --> 01:04:44,029
Sir, I have my orders,
and these orders will be executed.

663
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:45,501
Ma'am.

664
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:50,500
Prepare to mount.

665
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,275
Mount.

666
01:04:54,918 --> 01:04:56,674
Forward...

667
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:57,821
ho!

668
01:05:08,198 --> 01:05:11,395
- Angie.
- I can't talk now. I have to think.

669
01:05:12,071 --> 01:05:13,827
I'll put your things outside.

670
01:06:12,326 --> 01:06:15,523
- Before I go I want to explain something.
- Yes?

671
01:06:16,295 --> 01:06:18,716
It didn't happen in the low way you heard it.

672
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:22,406
- I didn't bushwhack.
- I never for a moment thought you did.

673
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:25,696
- But you killed him.
- I didn't have any choice...

674
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:28,254
- he cut loose at me<i>...</i>
- I should have known that.

675
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,707
I should have known you were lying
to make me think well of him.

676
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:35,360
Poor Ed. I guess he wasn't the sort of man
to die well.

677
01:06:35,847 --> 01:06:37,505
Sorry now I hated him so much.

678
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:40,541
I guess he couldn't help
being weak and selfish.

679
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,361
- I just didn't have any choice.
- I know that.

680
01:06:47,623 --> 01:06:49,859
You're gonna feel differently about me?

681
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:53,124
No one has any control
over the way they feel.

682
01:06:54,022 --> 01:06:56,739
I'm never going to change
the way I feel about you.

683
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:59,070
But...

684
01:06:59,751 --> 01:07:01,092
what about him?

685
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:07,677
Yeah.

686
01:07:09,287 --> 01:07:11,839
Guess there are some things
that just can't<i>...</i>

687
01:07:14,022 --> 01:07:15,648
He's gonna be a good man.

688
01:07:16,742 --> 01:07:20,604
Good spread to his shoulders.
Head works, too.

689
01:07:22,054 --> 01:07:26,429
Other night, after you went to sleep,
he crawled up into my bunk...

690
01:07:27,206 --> 01:07:29,028
and put his arms around my neck.

691
01:07:30,182 --> 01:07:32,004
Made me feel kind of funny.

692
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:34,594
Like he was depending on me.

693
01:07:35,494 --> 01:07:37,883
Lot of things I'd rather do than this.

694
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:39,680
You're going to tell him?

695
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:44,161
If I don't, somebody else will.
And I got a belly full of lies.

696
01:07:50,054 --> 01:07:52,094
Look what I got!

697
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:55,585
- Hold him by the gills like I showed you.
- Sure.

698
01:07:56,966 --> 01:08:00,097
- Johnny, I want to tell you something.
- It's a nice perch, ain't it?

699
01:08:00,198 --> 01:08:02,303
Bass. Remember the shape of its head?

700
01:08:02,407 --> 01:08:05,309
Oh yeah, I forgot.
Bass have a jaw that stick out like this.

701
01:08:06,726 --> 01:08:08,581
What I wanted to tell you is...

702
01:08:08,678 --> 01:08:10,947
while back, a man came at me with a gun.

703
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:13,245
- I had to kill him.
- Good. Indian?

704
01:08:13,446 --> 01:08:16,348
No, he was a white man, Johnny,
but I didn't have any choice. He<i>...</i>

705
01:08:18,246 --> 01:08:21,858
I told you to press down on the shank,
and then you won't stick yourself.

706
01:08:22,151 --> 01:08:23,645
Won't break the hook, either.

707
01:08:24,774 --> 01:08:27,906
Here, bite down on this stick.
That's the way Indian youngsters...

708
01:08:28,006 --> 01:08:29,762
learn not to cry.

709
01:08:37,094 --> 01:08:39,461
- Johnny, this man I killed...
- No!

710
01:08:42,086 --> 01:08:46,047
Your ranch in California,
it's far, too far for gossip to travel.

711
01:08:47,367 --> 01:08:49,756
Go wrap your thumb
in some bayberry leaves.

712
01:08:51,782 --> 01:08:53,669
You and your silly ideals.

713
01:08:54,247 --> 01:08:56,668
You think truth is the most important thing.

714
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:58,943
- It's the measure of a man.
- Not for a woman.

715
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:02,211
A man can afford to have noble sentiments
and poses.

716
01:09:02,502 --> 01:09:05,437
But a woman only has the man she marries.
That's her truth.

717
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:07,909
And if he's no good, that's still her truth.

718
01:09:08,006 --> 01:09:10,876
I married a man who was a liar,
a thief, and a coward.

719
01:09:11,015 --> 01:09:12,957
He was a drunkard and unfaithful.

720
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:16,608
He only married me to get this ranch, and
then he deserted Johnny and me for good.

721
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,914
And that's your fine truth for you.

722
01:09:19,366 --> 01:09:22,595
- Could I bring Johnny up on that?
- No, I guess you couldn't.

723
01:09:22,695 --> 01:09:24,800
And then you come along
and you're good and fine...

724
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:27,269
and everything that Ed
could never hope to be.

725
01:09:27,398 --> 01:09:31,195
And now, with your vanity, you want to spoil
Johnny's chances, and mine?

726
01:09:37,638 --> 01:09:40,606
<i>- Varlebena.</i>
- What?

727
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:44,097
When the Indians wind up their
squaw-seeking ceremony...

728
01:09:44,198 --> 01:09:47,068
they only say one word: <i>Varlebena.</i>

729
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:48,987
It means forever.

730
01:09:54,086 --> 01:09:55,013
Forever.

731
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:22,109
Well, we caught the wild cat.
Give us a hand, will you?

732
01:10:27,814 --> 01:10:29,854
I can't understand,
we killed him on the last charge.

733
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:30,906
Vittorio?

734
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:32,155
They had us surrounded.

735
01:10:32,263 --> 01:10:33,823
Could've cut us to pieces,
then they withdrew.

736
01:10:33,926 --> 01:10:36,228
That's why they pulled out.
Anytime their leader is killed...

737
01:10:36,326 --> 01:10:37,820
that means their medicine's bad.

738
01:10:37,927 --> 01:10:40,163
- This poor child.
- We're going out with this troop.

739
01:10:40,262 --> 01:10:41,822
- Vittorio's dead.
- No, he can't be.

740
01:10:41,926 --> 01:10:44,446
Everybody gets dead, it was his turn.
Now get your possibles.

741
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:45,727
I have some medicine in the cabin.

742
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,757
Thank you, Mrs. Lowe, I'd be...

743
01:10:46,854 --> 01:10:48,862
eternally grateful
if you'd pass among the men first.

744
01:10:48,966 --> 01:10:50,460
No, you're wounded,
I'm going to fix you up.

745
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:53,021
Thank you, ma'am.
The men are in worse shape than I am.

746
01:10:53,126 --> 01:10:55,712
Come on, do as he says.
We'll take care of him.

747
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:58,885
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?

748
01:10:59,078 --> 01:11:00,387
Dismount the men.

749
01:11:00,518 --> 01:11:02,852
- Hitch their horses up to the wagon.
- Yes, sir.

750
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:04,859
You'll find harness in the barn.

751
01:11:06,982 --> 01:11:08,062
Len.

752
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:12,510
- What do you want?
- Take four men and gather the settlers.

753
01:11:12,614 --> 01:11:15,265
We'll probably catch up with you
at Errad Crossing.

754
01:11:16,614 --> 01:11:18,981
Wilson, McGrath, Lyon, Johnson.

755
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:23,293
- How is he?
- He'll make out.

756
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:25,504
Don't know much. Led us into an ambush.

757
01:11:25,606 --> 01:11:29,381
But I ain't ashamed of him nohow.
Bullet holes are in the front of him.

758
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,583
All those youngsters from the Point
are like that.

759
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:32,996
They got to learn.

760
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:35,198
Partly they learn, partly they die.

761
01:11:35,398 --> 01:11:37,220
But I gotta float my stick same as you.

762
01:11:37,318 --> 01:11:39,871
I never saw one of them
I had to be ashamed of.

763
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:11,268
Join in and keep moving.

764
01:12:13,766 --> 01:12:15,555
Move it along, there!

765
01:12:15,942 --> 01:12:17,120
Hurry up!

766
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:26,239
Come on, move along here!

767
01:12:48,518 --> 01:12:50,045
Come on, hurry it up.

768
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,343
Circle the wagons!

769
01:13:07,974 --> 01:13:09,283
Wheel her around.

770
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:15,423
Hold on!

771
01:13:40,678 --> 01:13:43,428
Stay in the wagon.
Keep everybody in the wagons.

772
01:13:43,526 --> 01:13:44,770
And don't unhitch.

773
01:14:12,934 --> 01:14:14,111
Hondo!

774
01:14:14,758 --> 01:14:17,824
All this circle's doing is protect the horses.
We gotta turn some wagons over.

775
01:14:17,926 --> 01:14:20,293
And stay here? That's what they expect.

776
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:21,764
We gotta do what they don't expect.

777
01:14:21,861 --> 01:14:24,414
That's why all the heavy artillery's
in Buffalo's wagon.

778
01:14:24,518 --> 01:14:25,925
Buffalo!

779
01:14:28,454 --> 01:14:31,836
Lieutenant, get down. Are you ready, Buff?

780
01:14:31,942 --> 01:14:34,364
- I was born ready.
- Let's go.

781
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:39,868
Circle the wagons.

782
01:15:40,581 --> 01:15:41,509
Close up.

783
01:16:24,582 --> 01:16:26,143
Stay down!

784
01:16:26,246 --> 01:16:27,261
Sergeant!

785
01:16:49,094 --> 01:16:52,640
- I don't want to be an Apache, Mama.
- Now, you be quiet.

786
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:55,709
We're going to get out all right.
Now, help me, hurry.

787
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:09,086
- Ready again, Buff?
- As I told you, I was born ready.

788
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:46,944
Throw me your knife.

789
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:59,102
Get out of here!

790
01:19:04,038 --> 01:19:05,314
All right, Hondo!

791
01:19:07,653 --> 01:19:08,897
They're not following.

792
01:19:08,998 --> 01:19:11,300
Leader's dead.
They'll powwow and pick a new one.

793
01:19:11,398 --> 01:19:15,042
- We're out of trouble if we get a move on.
- And am I going to get to drive?

794
01:19:15,142 --> 01:19:18,491
Before we get to San Dimas,
you'll be a top teamster, son.

795
01:19:22,374 --> 01:19:24,229
- How are you, Lieutenant?
- Fine, thanks to you.

796
01:19:24,325 --> 01:19:28,187
And you're all right, thanks to Lennie.
He shot that Indian offen your back.

797
01:19:28,422 --> 01:19:30,047
- Thanks.
- With your rifle.

798
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:31,586
It's his.

799
01:19:31,878 --> 01:19:34,627
Don't look like we'll be needing it
much more today.

800
01:19:37,574 --> 01:19:40,640
General Crook will be here
within a month with a large force.

801
01:19:40,774 --> 01:19:43,905
- That'll be the end of the Apache.
- Yeah.

802
01:19:44,998 --> 01:19:46,427
End of a way of life.

803
01:19:47,494 --> 01:19:49,403
Too bad, it's a good way.

804
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:51,837
Wagons forward!
