1
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,523
Hey, Mama. Mom! Look at that.

2
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:01,294
Look, Mommy, look.

3
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:12,664
Johnny!

4
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,792
Now you let Mommy do the talking.
Remember.

5
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,323
Yes, Mom.

6
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,230
But he has no horse.

7
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:45,898
No talking.

8
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,691
Good morning.

9
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,352
- You look like you've had trouble.
- Yep.

10
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:13,796
I lost my horse a few days ago
getting away from some Indians.

11
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,958
Indians?

12
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:18,232
We made dry camp last night
above the Ilano.

13
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,538
Sam here smelled more Apaches,
nuzzled me up.

14
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:24,735
So I thought I'd put some miles between us.

15
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,869
But why? We're at peace with the Apache.

16
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,641
- We have a treaty.
- Yes, ma'am.

17
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:32,149
Now I got to get me a new horse,
borrow or buy one.

18
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,550
I can pay you in United States script.
I'm riding a dispatch for General Crook.

19
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,990
- My name's Lane.
- I'm Mrs. Lowe.

20
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:41,589
I'm Johnny.

21
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:44,696
- The water sure looks inviting.
- Well, help yourself.

22
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:46,629
Watch out for that dog, son.

23
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,302
Could you hire me or sell me a horse,
Mrs. Lowe?

24
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:54,533
Of course. I've only got plow horses,
and two that are only half-broken.

25
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,507
The hand that was breaking them for me
got hurt and had to go to town.

26
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:03,281
- You mean you're staying here alone?
- Oh, no.

27
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,846
No, my husband is up in the hills...

28
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,976
- working some cattle.
- Oh.

29
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:11,353
He would pick today to be away,
when we have a visitor.

30
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:13,422
I'd enjoy meeting him, ma'am.

31
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,792
I wouldn't touch that dog, son.
He don't take to petting.

32
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,302
And now if you'll allow, ma'am,
I'll take a look at those horses.

33
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:27,167
Of course.
You'll find a saddle over by the barn.

34
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:31,102
In the meantime, I'll fix you something
to eat. I imagine you're hungry.

35
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,838
I could eat. Thank you.

36
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:12,444
I'm so sorry my husband had to pick today
to go hunting those lost calves.

37
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:21,618
He would have enjoyed
having a man to talk to.

38
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:24,257
We welcome visitors.

39
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,124
Must be right Ionely around here.
Especially for a woman.

40
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,394
I don't mind. I was raised here.

41
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,470
- What can I feed your dog?
- Nothing, thanks.

42
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,335
He makes out by himself.
Can outrun any rabbit in the territory.

43
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:40,344
It's no trouble at all.

44
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:45,874
If you don't mind, ma'am,
I'd rather you didn't feed him.

45
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:50,247
I see. You don't want him to get in the habit
of taking food from anyone else.

46
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,220
Well, you can hand it to him.

47
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:56,460
No, ma'am, I don't feed him, either.
Sam's independent.

48
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,630
He doesn't need anybody.
I want him to stay that way.

49
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,263
It's a good way.

50
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:06,164
- Everyone needs someone.
- Yes, ma'am. Most everyone.

51
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:07,636
Too bad, isn't it?

52
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:10,040
- You're a good cook, ma'am.
- Thank you.

53
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:13,543
A woman should be a good cook.
Good cook myself.

54
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,707
Why didn't you get on him
when he was stuck?

55
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:47,300
'Cause I didn't want him sitting on me
from a standing start.

56
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:49,078
Stay with him.

57
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:26,075
You chose the most savage one.

58
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:28,113
I won't give you an argument there.

59
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:29,709
He's always been a fighter.

60
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,948
I wouldn't give a plugged nickel
for a horse that wouldn't fight.

61
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:35,525
It lets you down when the going gets tough.

62
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,193
It's a little dull.

63
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:41,163
Well, I can do almost everything
around a ranch, but I never could...

64
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:43,099
put an edge on an axe.

65
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,326
Where is it?

66
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,863
- What?
- The grindstone.

67
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,883
This ranch looks like it's been here
a little while.

68
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:05,443
Yes, I was born here.
My husband was raised here, too.

69
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:10,491
He's an orphan. His parents got killed
in a wagon-train massacre...

70
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:12,289
so my father took him in.

71
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,922
- Handy.
- What do you mean?

72
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,490
Well, it seems the figures are against it.

73
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:22,338
Only young fellow in 1,000 square miles...

74
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,004
only young girl in 1,000 square miles.

75
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:30,515
They get in a whirl over each other.
That's what I meant. Handy.

76
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:33,176
I guess it was quite a coincidence.

77
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,246
But they say that the right two people are
going to meet by an arrangement of destiny.

78
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,653
You believe that, Mrs. Lowe?

79
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,716
- Yes, I do.
- Interesting.

80
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:56,597
Always sink a blade into a log, son.
Keeps the edge clean.

81
00:08:57,774 --> 00:09:00,902
Well, I guess I'd better quit stalling
and get back to that horse.

82
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:02,706
And can I play with Sam now?

83
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,311
I've told you twice not to.

84
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,406
But you do what you wanna do.

85
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:21,561
Really, Mr. Lane, if you knew
the dog would bite, I should think...

86
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:25,294
Mrs. Lowe, people learn by getting bit.
Youngster just learned.

87
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,029
Johnny.

88
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:35,769
Don't you ever touch that dog again!
Now go in and take your nap.

89
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,748
While I'm at it, I'll shoe those plow horses.

90
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:23,053
Thank you very much.
They do need a shoeing, I guess.

91
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,353
They do.

92
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:28,895
I guess my husband's having a hard time
finding those strayed calves.

93
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:30,493
I guess he is.

94
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,802
Perhaps he won't be home
until late tonight...

95
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:38,498
or he may even camp in the hills
and come in tomorrow after you're gone.

96
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:42,944
He'll be so sorry to have missed
one of our very few occasional visitors.

97
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,944
I guess I'll go and look after Johnny.

98
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,117
Mrs. Lowe, you're a liar.

99
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:54,212
- And an almighty poor liar.
- I don't understand you.

100
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,154
These horses haven't been shod
in a couple of months.

101
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:00,353
It's a cinch that axe hasn't had
an edge on it in two months.

102
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:04,296
And your tea can, a five-pound tea can
in your house is empty.

103
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,862
Your husband's been gone a long time.

104
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:09,733
Now, look here, Mr. Lane,
I don't think you have any right to...

105
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,466
I'm not talking about rights.
I'm talking about lies.

106
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,439
Why did you lie to me, Mrs. Lowe?

107
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:18,502
Were you afraid that maybe you wouldn't be
safe here with me with your husband away?

108
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:21,447
- That it?
- That's partly it.

109
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:24,910
Women always figure every man
comes along wants them.

110
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,842
- Mr. Lane.
- Yes, ma'am?

111
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,838
You're right. I was lying.
My husband is overdue.

112
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:29,416
He should have been home long ago.

113
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,348
Figure Apaches killed him?

114
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:34,182
Of course not.
There are a hundred possible explanations.

115
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,812
Indians are one of them.

116
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,255
But we're at peace with the Apache,
except for a few...

117
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,122
Mrs. Lowe, if you've got good sense...

118
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:43,129
you'll pack up you and that boy of yours
and come out with me.

119
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:45,631
There's trouble brewing
in the Apache lodges.

120
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,463
Vittorio, their main chief,
called a war council.

121
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,299
A full report of it is in that dispatch
I'm carrying.

122
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:55,341
But you don't know, we've always
gotten along splendidly with the Apache.

123
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,704
They drink and bring their horses
to our spring...

124
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,144
on their way north to the buffalo hunt.

125
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:05,647
I've never seen the great Vittorio,
but there've been plenty of Apaches here.

126
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:10,416
I've seen the great Vittorio,
before the treaty.

127
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:16,989
His horse had 40 scalps hung in its mane.

128
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:18,861
That was before the treaty.

129
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:22,433
We broke that treaty, us Whites.

130
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:26,932
There's no word in the Apache language
for lie, and they've been lied to.

131
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,174
If they rise, there won't be...

132
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,302
- a White left in the territory.
- They won't bother me.

133
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,244
Us, I mean. We always got along very well.

134
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,912
People I know, man and his wife,
got along real well for...

135
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,688
20 years. Then one day...

136
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,317
she upped and blew a hole in him...

137
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,985
big enough to drive a stagecoach through.

138
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,190
She got mad. The Apaches are mad.

139
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,730
Well, I have nothing to worry about,
I'm sure.

140
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,992
Nice to be sure.

141
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,706
Get out of the way.

142
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,439
- Strange dog you have.
- I don't have him.

143
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,847
- The two of you are together.
- He stays with me.

144
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,815
- He can smell an Indian at a half a mile.
- He smells Indians? I don't believe it.

145
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,817
Sure, lots of dogs smell Indians.
You can teach them.

146
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,253
Teach them? How?

147
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,951
First you get yourself a puppy and then...

148
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,687
you hire yourself a tame Indian
and cut a willow switch.

149
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,492
Then you get the Indian to beat the puppy...

150
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,897
with a willow switch four or five times
a day.

151
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,801
And when he grows up,
he'll always signal when he smells an Indian.

152
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,169
Beat a puppy. How cruel.

153
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,236
That's the way they do it.

154
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,708
Anyway, I don't believe
a dog can smell Indians.

155
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,972
I mean, as different from anyone else.

156
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,878
- You or me, for instance.
- Well, they can.

157
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,076
As a matter of fact,
Indians can smell White people.

158
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,483
- I don't believe it.
- Well, it's true.

159
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:52,386
I'm part Indian, and I can smell you
when I'm downwind of you.

160
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:59,465
- That's impossible.
- No, it isn't impossible, Mrs. Lowe.

161
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,700
You baked today.
I can smell fresh bread on you.

162
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,604
Sometime today you cooked with salt pork.

163
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,844
Smell that on you, too.

164
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,850
You smell all over like soap.

165
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:24,749
You took a bath. And on top of that,
you smell all over like a woman.

166
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:30,457
I could find you in the dark, Mrs. Lowe,
and I'm only part Indian.

167
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,732
Mrs. Lowe.

168
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,708
What do you want?

169
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,640
- I watered and grained the stock.
- Thank you.

170
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,849
I'll bed down near here someplace tonight.

171
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,614
Mr. Lane?

172
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,821
You can't sleep outside,
there's a storm coming.

173
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,430
I've fixed a pallet for you in the corner.

174
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,965
It would be uncivilized
to let anyone sleep outside...

175
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,544
and after all, we are civilized, aren't we?

176
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,204
Speaking for you, of course. But me?

177
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,177
I guess you could call me civilized.

178
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,849
That's your bed.
I'm sorry it has to be on the floor.

179
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:12,525
I have to set the batter for the morning.
I hope the noise won't disturb you.

180
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,160
It won't.

181
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,768
Good night, ma'am.

182
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,658
Put that gun down.

183
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,822
You're Hondo Lane, the gunman.

184
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,562
- I carry a gun.
- Don't come any nearer.

185
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:55,568
You killed three men in a gunfight last year.

186
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:58,141
- We heard about it. Three men.
- Yes, ma'am.

187
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:01,140
- Just as quick as I could.
- Don't come any nearer.

188
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:06,448
It's not a very good idea
to point one of these things at anybody...

189
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:09,042
with an empty chamber under the firing pin.

190
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,185
You can see it plain as day.

191
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,084
I keep it that way because of Johnny.

192
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:15,956
Well, now it's loaded.

193
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:19,391
Keep it that way, and keep it high.

194
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:34,141
Please stay. I really want you to.

195
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:39,577
I'm sorry. I should have realized from
the beginning that you are a gentleman.

196
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:48,356
Civilized? Gentleman?

197
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,224
Well, a lot for one day.

198
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,566
Night, ma'am.

199
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:22,021
Morning. Getting an early start.

200
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:26,087
Be sure and tell that little man
goodbye for me.

201
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:28,664
I ought to wake him to say goodbye to you.

202
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,823
Was it me, I'd let him sleep.

203
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:34,371
Youngsters grow sleeping,
but you do what you want to.

204
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,073
He was so delighted with that whistle
you made for him.

205
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:42,237
Glad to hear it. He and I got along just fine.

206
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,540
It's more like a flute than a whistle.
It ranges almost the full scale.

207
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:50,046
I learned to make them when I was
living with the Mescalero.

208
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:53,122
My squaw used to make them
for every kid in the lodge.

209
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:57,388
- You lived with the Apache?
- Five years.

210
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:01,358
- And you had an Indian wife?
- Wife, squaw<i>...</i>

211
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:06,234
I took the liberty of borrowing a few feet
of rope off of that coil in the lean-to.

212
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:10,001
- Gladly pay you for it, if you let me.
- 'Course not.

213
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,833
The hills are so beautiful today.

214
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:16,276
Odd how clear they always are
after a dust storm.

215
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:22,582
Must have been very interesting
living with the Apache.

216
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:24,182
I liked it.

217
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:29,748
- This Indian wife you have<i>...</i>
- Had. She's dead.

218
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,186
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up
an unhappy memory.

219
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:40,670
I can't remember anything unhappy
about Destarte.

220
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:45,597
Destarte? How musical. What does it mean?

221
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:51,781
You can't say it except in Mescalero.
It means morning.

222
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,243
But that isn't what it means, either.

223
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:59,921
Means more than just that.
Indian words mean the sound and...

224
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,085
feel of a word, like...

225
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:05,792
crack of dawn, the first bronze light...

226
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:09,456
that makes the buttes stand out
against the gray desert.

227
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,564
The first sound you hear of a brook...

228
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,363
curling over some rocks, with trout jumping.

229
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:19,599
It's like when you get up in the first light...

230
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:24,242
just you and her and you go out of
a wickiup.

231
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:29,680
Where it smells kind of smoky and private,
just you and her, and...

232
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,983
kind of safe with just the two of you.

233
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,656
Stand outside and...

234
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:39,788
feel the bite of the first wind
coming down from the high divide...

235
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,458
that promises snowfall.

236
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:48,228
Can't say it in English,
but that was her name.

237
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:50,765
Destarte.

238
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:57,268
- You remind me of her some.
- Of an Indian girl?

239
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,270
Was she fair?

240
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,915
Her hair was black as 10 feet down.

241
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:05,752
Did you ever see a crow's wing,
how black and gleaming it is?

242
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:08,049
- Yes.
- That's the way her hair shined.

243
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:10,950
I'd like to pay you for that rope.

244
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,086
Riding dispatch,
I have the right to give U.S. Script.

245
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,322
- You loved her?
- I don't know.

246
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:20,965
I needed her.

247
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:29,170
- But if she was dark and I'm fair...
- Why you reminded me of her?

248
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,643
- Yes.
- I don't know.

249
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,111
I thought about it.
You don't look anything like her.

250
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:38,748
I am fully aware
that I am a homely woman, Mr. Lane.

251
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:40,343
I didn't mean that.

252
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:43,856
I have a bad habit of telling the truth.
But being pretty isn't much.

253
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,950
I know a lot of pretty people
I wouldn't trust...

254
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,153
with a busted nickel-plated watch.

255
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:51,492
But some others, something comes out of
the inside of them and...

256
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:53,931
you know you can trust them.

257
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,232
Destarte had that.

258
00:22:57,473 --> 00:22:59,373
And you've got it, too.

259
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:07,015
- I'm a married woman.
- I thought about that, too.

260
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:10,380
I guess I kissed you
because you remind me of Destarte.

261
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:12,680
Or maybe it was because
I hate to think of your hair...

262
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:15,312
hanging from the center pole
of an Apache wickiup.

263
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:18,924
Well, a long time ago I made me a rule.

264
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:22,192
I let people do what they want to do.

265
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,666
Sam!

266
00:23:33,307 --> 00:23:35,468
You are a strange man, Mr. Lane.

267
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,646
I don't know about that.
Goodbye, Mrs. Lowe.

268
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:55,085
- You are Vittorio.
- I am Vittorio.

269
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,420
Your horses have been watered here.

270
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:01,928
- You were told to go.
- I couldn't leave.

271
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:05,490
My husband is away,
and I didn't think that I<i>...</i>

272
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:12,601
Your people water their horses here.

273
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:18,674
You leave my mother alone.

274
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:57,513
Stop him! Stop him!

275
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:15,092
- I ain't scared of you.
- You're not fear Apache?

276
00:26:18,104 --> 00:26:19,502
No.

277
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:23,705
He fear hurt to mother, but not that to self.

278
00:26:25,612 --> 00:26:28,206
He brave. Like Apache boy.

279
00:26:36,222 --> 00:26:39,748
Him now blood brother.
I call him Small Warrior.

280
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,554
Him belong Moon Dog Lodge,
Chiricahua Apache.

281
00:26:42,662 --> 00:26:46,564
You care for him well.
You now mother Chiricahua warrior.

282
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:48,256
Live safely here.

283
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:54,134
I hope someday,
someone befriends your sons.

284
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:57,572
My sons are dead. White man kill them.

285
00:28:32,104 --> 00:28:35,972
Figured your scalp would be hanging
in some Apache wickiup by now.

286
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:38,703
- Hi, Buffalo.
- Been making bets on it.

287
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,644
- You're sure a disappointment to me, Hondo.
- You like to win your bet.

288
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:44,742
I wore out some horses.

289
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:47,942
You wore out you while you was at it.
Here, let me get that.

290
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:50,953
Where's that water?

291
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:57,359
- Looks like I won a bet, Buffalo.
- Hi, Dick.

292
00:28:57,462 --> 00:28:59,624
Yeah, I owe you a jug of red-eye.

293
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:04,327
- This feels good.
- There's times when water is good.

294
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,566
That's exactly what I mean.

295
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:14,042
I say I got a right to talk to
this here bow-necked Major...

296
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:16,545
- I don't talk to no underlings.
- Major's asleep.

297
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:19,445
That's just too bad about him.
I'm a citizen and I want to see him.

298
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,643
Major ain't had any sleep for three days.

299
00:29:21,753 --> 00:29:23,983
I can tell you everything
just as well as he can.

300
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:26,522
We ain't heard nothing from up north.

301
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,556
If you ask me, the Cavalry's scared of
Vittorio. I think the U.S. Cavalry...

302
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,256
I am greatly interested in your opinion of
the United States Cavalry.

303
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:36,594
Continue, Mr<i>...</i> Whatever your name is.

304
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,161
The Cavalry is supposed to support
the settlers.

305
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,999
I've got some cattle up north,
I don't intend...

306
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:44,802
C troop is making a sweep to the north
to escort out any settlers they may find.

307
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,840
C troop is now over a week late
in returning. That's all I can tell you.

308
00:29:50,148 --> 00:29:52,013
C troop isn't coming back.

309
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,786
I'd be obliged, sir, if you would leave.

310
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:04,418
A fine business, the whole territory...

311
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:05,893
- Sergeant!
- Get!

312
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,696
Get out of the way, you mangy<i>...</i>

313
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:21,377
- lf that's your cur, get him out of the way.
- Walk around him.

314
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:24,745
I'll be hanged if I go out of my way
for any cur dog.

315
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,883
A man ought to do what he thinks is best.

316
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:42,998
Quit blocking the door.

317
00:30:47,103 --> 00:30:48,695
Where did you get this?

318
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:52,000
- Half a day's ride south of Twin Buttes.
- How?

319
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:54,677
Took it off a couple of Indians, Apaches.

320
00:30:54,945 --> 00:30:57,106
Running Dog Lodge of the Mescaleros.

321
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,508
Mescaleros are up, too.
That makes all the Apache lodges.

322
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:05,418
Say, while I was south, did any settlers
get in from the north basin?

323
00:31:05,522 --> 00:31:06,922
A few, the last couple of weeks.

324
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:10,015
Handsome woman, fair,
with a boy about six?

325
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:12,560
No, mostly middle-aged or elderly people.

326
00:31:12,796 --> 00:31:15,287
Get some sleep, Lane, use my tent.

327
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:16,690
Thank you.

328
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:29,103
While you're sleeping,
I'll move your possibles over to my tent.

329
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,346
Pete Britton was scouting with C troop.

330
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:38,651
Wintered with old Pete once
up on the Divide. Ornery cuss.

331
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:41,789
Them indians you took that pennant offen.

332
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:43,825
- Dead Indians?
- Finally.

333
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:00,906
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi, Hondo.

334
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:03,136
Broke my heart when I heard you made it.

335
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:06,408
Your pap know you started out
against this so-called whiskey?

336
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:07,880
I ain't seen him for a month.

337
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:10,178
I know you haven't. Come here,
I got a message for you.

338
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:12,775
Leave him be, Hondo,
I can't make no money scouting.

339
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:15,412
Aw, these other fellows'll excuse you.
Come on over at the bar.

340
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:19,323
I won't. I'm out almost $100.

341
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:22,991
- That figures, with Buffalo in the game.
- Wait a minute.

342
00:32:23,865 --> 00:32:25,925
These shirts are hard to come by.

343
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:33,905
- What'd you hit me for?
- 'Cause I know you.

344
00:32:34,008 --> 00:32:35,168
Leather it.

345
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:39,542
No, don't leather it.

346
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:51,157
No wonder them Apaches
call him <i>Emberato.</i>

347
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:53,227
- What does it mean?
- Bad temper.

348
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:00,966
I should've let him shoot you.

349
00:33:01,335 --> 00:33:04,827
That's the second time I've tangled with
that mouthy no-good<i>...</i>

350
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:08,806
- What's his name?
- Calls himself Lowe, Ed Lowe.

351
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,480
Johnny.

352
00:33:26,693 --> 00:33:28,389
Johnny!

353
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,171
Mommy.

354
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,812
Hi, Mommy.
Vittorio says I'll make a good Apache.

355
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,148
I thought<i>...</i> I didn't know he was with you,
I didn't hear anything.

356
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:57,184
- Apache no make noise.
- Look what he gave me.

357
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,657
- It is lodge token. His.
- It's very pretty, thank you.

358
00:34:01,262 --> 00:34:02,695
He will ride well.

359
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,220
And he no afraid.

360
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:09,301
- I speak with your mother, go to house.
- Yes, Vittorio.

361
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,500
Lodge should have man.

362
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:18,805
- My husband will be home any day now.
- I no think so.

363
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,771
I think he dead.

364
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:29,980
Small Warrior should have father.

365
00:34:44,404 --> 00:34:46,565
See, Sergeant, just like I told you.

366
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,373
That's my horse, all right.
Got my brand on it: "E.L." Ed Lowe.

367
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:52,001
What he says true?

368
00:34:52,112 --> 00:34:54,706
- Yeah, that's his horse.
- Where'd you get him?

369
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,011
From his ranch,
that's where I'm taking him back.

370
00:34:58,785 --> 00:35:00,184
That's where he can pick him up.

371
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:03,517
But that's Indian territory, strict orders
against any Whites going in there.

372
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:07,718
You know something, Joe, I got a bad ear.
I can't hear a thing you're saying.

373
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:18,403
Aren't you gonna prefer charges
against him?

374
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:21,065
He may be a mean, ornery,
son-of-anything-you-wanna-call-him...

375
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:22,731
but he ain't no horse thief.

376
00:35:22,842 --> 00:35:25,902
And I'm not gonna call him one,
to his face or his back.

377
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:41,492
You stay here.

378
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:58,639
I thought the Apache were always silent.

379
00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:02,436
Not when they seek squaw. You pick one.

380
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,008
What?

381
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,948
It's not good for Small Warrior...

382
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:08,849
to be without father
to teach him how to be man.

383
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:13,123
This is the one I was calling Emiliano.

384
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,059
Very brave, has taken many scalps.

385
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:21,232
He has six horses, and two squaws,
but one old and will soon die.

386
00:36:24,471 --> 00:36:25,801
He's good hunter.

387
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:27,867
Never hungry, his wickiup.

388
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,105
This is one who is called Kloori.

389
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:36,974
He has ten horses, one squaw.

390
00:36:38,717 --> 00:36:41,652
Sachito, brave warrior, many horses.

391
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:47,052
Not much beat squaws, sings very loud.

392
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:59,596
- Boy, go stand by my horse.
- Yes, Vittorio.

393
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:06,436
Small Warrior never to see tears,
Apache does not weep.

394
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:09,842
Chief, you can't make me do this,
I'm married.

395
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:12,279
You are fool, your man dead.

396
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:16,353
Soon come planting rain.
If your man come home by then, good.

397
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:18,590
If not, you take Apache brave.

398
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,732
Remember, time of planting rain.

399
00:37:41,246 --> 00:37:43,111
He's getting kind of deep
into Indian territory.

400
00:37:43,214 --> 00:37:44,442
And so are we.

401
00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:47,847
What are you squawking for?
You're getting well paid.

402
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:52,618
He'll be making camp pretty soon. Don't
get a chance at him then, we'll turn back.

403
00:38:27,692 --> 00:38:29,557
Quiet, Sam, I hear them.

404
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:42,737
Come on, Sam.

405
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,342
That's his camp, all right.

406
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,122
Rifle's gone,
must be out looking for camp meat.

407
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:48,964
- You're all right, you're not hurt bad.
- This tintype saved me.

408
00:39:57,547 --> 00:39:58,947
That did it.

409
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:02,781
Now, every Apache between us
and the ranch will be alerted.

410
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:05,548
They'll have us cut off.

411
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:08,720
No, there's nobody between us
and Fort Seddon.

412
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:30,273
Beat it, Sam!

413
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:40,922
- White man understand Apache.
- A little.

414
00:44:41,394 --> 00:44:43,295
He know now how he die.

415
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,930
Your coup stick shows many scalps.

416
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,328
Yes, many. Soon, you.

417
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:50,970
Man's scalp would look out of place there.

418
00:44:51,072 --> 00:44:54,336
You took all yours from squaws,
papoose, and dogs.

419
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:59,539
Your lodge should be real proud of you.

420
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:11,224
You will take long time die.

421
00:45:32,112 --> 00:45:34,046
Where are soldiers, White man?

422
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,547
- How many?
- I don't know, Vittorio.

423
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,982
You know my name?

424
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:41,350
I saw you once at the Treaty Council
at Fort Meade.

425
00:45:41,454 --> 00:45:42,546
The treaty.

426
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:55,126
The treaty was like rustle of wind
to White man.

427
00:45:55,702 --> 00:46:00,139
- Now you tell, where are soldiers?
- This, I do not know.

428
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:03,371
- Hat. Soldier hat.
- I was once a soldier.

429
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:05,569
Why you here Apache land?

430
00:46:06,479 --> 00:46:08,208
This is for me to know.

431
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:44,879
I'm told you speak insults
to this one of my chiefs.

432
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:51,045
The cougar screams insults and is brave.

433
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,588
A coyote howls insults and is a coward.

434
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:57,462
We shall see.

435
00:46:57,997 --> 00:47:00,557
Cougar or coyote.

436
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:03,627
You will die bravely in silence...

437
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:07,095
or you will wail
like woman bringing forth child...

438
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,064
and cry out to us where pony-soldiers are.

439
00:48:00,826 --> 00:48:03,488
He claims the blood right, you understand?

440
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:06,456
You mean, he says I shot his brother?

441
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:09,794
I understand.

442
00:48:40,466 --> 00:48:43,025
So that life may ebb cleanly.

443
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,734
Forget your blood right or join your brother.

444
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:16,816
You think you buy your life now?

445
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:19,059
I don't think.

446
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,155
You may live or die, we see.

447
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:15,479
Indians.

448
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:41,208
Is this your man?

449
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:44,203
Speak, is this your man?

450
00:51:44,814 --> 00:51:48,045
- Yes, this is my husband.
- White man...

451
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:53,388
you lived with the Apache, that's good.

452
00:51:53,957 --> 00:51:55,948
You know how Small Warrior
should be taught that...

453
00:51:56,058 --> 00:51:59,255
he be honored son of wickiup
of one who's called Vittorio.

454
00:51:59,362 --> 00:52:02,728
Watch like the hawk,
be patient as the beaver...

455
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:05,457
brave as puma, that he may learn well.

456
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:07,199
Know it, then...

457
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:10,938
or your dying will be long before
you welcome death.

458
00:53:25,948 --> 00:53:27,916
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

459
00:53:31,653 --> 00:53:34,588
- What are you gonna do?
- Gonna fix up your shirt.

460
00:53:35,391 --> 00:53:37,382
Not before I show you something.

461
00:53:44,466 --> 00:53:48,027
- Did Ed give you this?
- I took it off his body.

462
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:50,400
He's dead.

463
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:54,803
Tried to tell you before.

464
00:53:56,979 --> 00:53:58,708
Funny, I'm not surprised.

465
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:03,413
Perhaps because I knew all along,
just wouldn't admit it to myself.

466
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,249
- Hi, <i>Emberato,</i> you didn't die, did you?
- Hello, Johnny.

467
00:54:06,354 --> 00:54:07,379
Be careful.

468
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:10,014
I wanna show you something, <i>Emberato.</i>
My Indian emblem.

469
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,355
Vittorio gave it to me, didn't he, Mom?

470
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:20,030
- He's taken a great liking to Johnny.
- Probably saved your life and mine.

471
00:54:20,568 --> 00:54:23,059
Indians place great value on male children.

472
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:26,431
They also place a great value on dying well.

473
00:54:28,077 --> 00:54:29,669
Did Ed die well?

474
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:32,377
I keep it under my pillow.

475
00:54:34,015 --> 00:54:35,175
He died well.

476
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:39,982
When Johnny's old enough,
when he has to be told...

477
00:54:41,155 --> 00:54:42,748
it will make him proud.

478
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:47,159
Here it is, <i>Emberato.</i> I'm a chief now.
Isn't it wonderful?

479
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:54,527
- Isn't it?
- Yes, Johnny.

480
00:55:30,337 --> 00:55:32,932
- Where's your mother?
- Picking watercress.

481
00:55:33,207 --> 00:55:35,641
- Any luck?
- Not a bite this morning.

482
00:55:36,978 --> 00:55:38,467
See where the sun is?

483
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,273
- Up there.
- Yeah, on the back of your neck.

484
00:55:41,382 --> 00:55:42,974
You're casting a shadow.

485
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,279
If you can see it, the fish can see it.

486
00:55:45,386 --> 00:55:48,946
Always fish with the sun in your face.
The other bank's the place.

487
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:52,958
- That is, if you want my opinion.
- Gosh, <i>Emberato,</i> I want your opinion.

488
00:55:53,261 --> 00:55:54,819
But Mama won't let me go over there.

489
00:55:54,928 --> 00:55:56,863
- Why not?
- I can't swim.

490
00:55:57,931 --> 00:56:00,126
- You can't what?
- I can't swim.

491
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:02,132
- How old are you?
- Six.

492
00:56:13,747 --> 00:56:18,241
- Help him, he can't swim.
- Time he learned. Everybody should swim.

493
00:56:20,254 --> 00:56:23,121
Just reach out in front of you
and grab a handful of water.

494
00:56:23,223 --> 00:56:24,919
Pull it back towards you.

495
00:56:27,527 --> 00:56:30,189
Not too fast. That's the way I learned.

496
00:56:35,802 --> 00:56:38,499
- I did it, <i>Emberato,</i> I did it.
- Good.

497
00:56:39,172 --> 00:56:41,265
- How will he get back?
- Swim.

498
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:42,966
Well, he might drown.

499
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:45,911
- Well, then, you go get him.
- I can't swim, either.

500
00:58:07,093 --> 00:58:08,583
Angie, there's...

501
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,657
something I've got to tell you.
I tried to tell you.

502
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:16,334
- And it isn't going to be easy.
- Then don't say it yet.

503
00:58:16,902 --> 00:58:18,460
Just look at the moon.

504
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:22,400
How odd it looks in this quarter.

505
00:58:24,076 --> 00:58:27,842
When I was a child, my mother
used to tell me it was a teeter-totter.

506
00:58:29,682 --> 00:58:32,480
You know, the tilted plank a child plays on.

507
00:58:33,419 --> 00:58:35,854
I suppose the Indians have a word for it.

508
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:39,057
Yeah, <i>bermarga.</i> It's the planting moon.

509
00:58:39,158 --> 00:58:41,991
Indians won't plant their corn
unless the moon's like that.

510
00:58:42,094 --> 00:58:44,688
You liked living with the Apache, didn't you?

511
00:58:45,297 --> 00:58:47,528
Angie, I've just got to tell you this.

512
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,758
I'm not much for lying.

513
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:52,564
The last time I was here,
before Vittorio brought me?

514
00:58:52,671 --> 00:58:53,638
Yes.

515
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:57,402
I rode dispatch some after that,
then came to Seddon.

516
00:58:58,143 --> 00:58:59,474
There was trouble.

517
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,674
I killed a man.

518
00:59:05,617 --> 00:59:08,347
Stay still. Somebody in those willows.

519
00:59:10,456 --> 00:59:12,048
Don't shoot, White man.

520
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:23,661
Small Warrior has knife. He sleeps with it.

521
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:26,028
- You were in the house?
- In house.

522
00:59:27,005 --> 00:59:30,634
Wickiup empty place without sons.
Mine empty wickiup.

523
00:59:31,143 --> 00:59:35,238
You better tell that brave back at
the creek bank not to walk in the water.

524
00:59:35,347 --> 00:59:37,611
I almost killed him a few minutes ago.

525
00:59:43,855 --> 00:59:45,618
Almost threw a shot at him.

526
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:48,122
He very young. Will learn.

527
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,987
- Lf he lives.
- You are Apache.

528
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:54,994
Now, hear me, pony-soldiers are near.

529
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:59,560
Soon will be fought remembered fight.
They will come here first.

530
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:03,671
- You will not go with them, White man.
- I will not.

531
01:00:04,009 --> 01:00:06,500
Leader of pony-soldiers will question you.

532
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:10,271
You will say you have seen Apache
trailing to the west.

533
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:13,050
This I won't do.

534
01:00:14,786 --> 01:00:17,051
- You will not?
- I will not.

535
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,921
You have good man, treasure him.

536
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,636
They're mounting up now
down by the butte.

537
01:00:32,737 --> 01:00:34,535
I don't hear a thing.

538
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:36,569
There's eight of them I'd say,
or maybe nine.

539
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:40,872
- There's something in those trees.
- That's a squirrel. Our talking woke him up.

540
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:43,708
He's put out. There's nine of them.

541
01:00:44,582 --> 01:00:45,913
I love you.

542
01:00:48,486 --> 01:00:50,716
I suppose I shouldn't have said that...

543
01:00:50,822 --> 01:00:52,881
with my husband dead so short a time.

544
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:57,427
I don't guess people's hearts
got anything to do with a calendar.

545
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,236
You were so wonderful,
refusing to lie for Vittorio.

546
01:01:12,009 --> 01:01:14,602
He was testing me. Indians hate lies.

547
01:01:15,813 --> 01:01:18,406
And I guess I got to feel the same way...

548
01:01:19,283 --> 01:01:21,409
but, once in a while a fella's got to...

549
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:24,281
lie if it'll make it easier on someone else.

550
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:49,943
Troop, halt!

551
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:54,650
Prepare to dismount.

552
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:56,984
Dismount!

553
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:12,591
Madam and sir, may I present myself?
Lt. McKay, Troop D, 8th cavalry.

554
01:02:12,703 --> 01:02:15,729
- Hi, Hondo, you old cabin robber.
- Hi, Buff.

555
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,773
Lieutenant, this here is Hondo Lane.

556
01:02:18,108 --> 01:02:21,373
He's scouted some
and ridden dispatch some for the cavalry.

557
01:02:21,711 --> 01:02:25,203
- I don't reckon I know this here lady.
- This is Ms. Lowe, Lieutenant.

558
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:27,306
You people are lucky. Obviously, Vittorio...

559
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:30,215
and his renegade band
just happened not to find this hidden valley.

560
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,618
- Vittorio's been here lots.
- And you lived?

561
01:02:32,722 --> 01:02:34,417
One Ione man stood off Vittorio?

562
01:02:34,524 --> 01:02:37,721
No Ione man stands off the Apache.
He lets us live here.

563
01:02:38,295 --> 01:02:40,786
There are almost 100 dead settlers
in the basin...

564
01:02:40,897 --> 01:02:42,865
scalped by this cowardly criminal.

565
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:45,958
Vittorio may be a criminal by the books,
I don't know.

566
01:02:46,102 --> 01:02:48,536
But if he's a coward,
it hasn't showed up yet.

567
01:02:48,638 --> 01:02:50,764
- Amen, brother.
- I must disagree with you, Mr. Lane.

568
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:52,774
He's run before us for 200 miles.

569
01:02:52,876 --> 01:02:55,674
Indians have a story
they tell their young ones...

570
01:02:56,012 --> 01:02:59,573
about a hunter who chased a wild cat
until he caught it.

571
01:02:59,683 --> 01:03:01,048
Then it was the other way around.

572
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:03,414
The story goes back further than
the Indians.

573
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,012
It's originally attributed
to the first Roman army to enter Tartary.

574
01:03:07,122 --> 01:03:08,715
The soldier caught a Tartar and yelled out.

575
01:03:08,825 --> 01:03:11,259
The officer called back for him to come in
with his prisoner.

576
01:03:11,361 --> 01:03:13,692
And he replied, "The Tartar won't let me."

577
01:03:14,631 --> 01:03:16,565
That was one of the favorite stories
of Col. Mays...

578
01:03:16,666 --> 01:03:18,361
who teaches cavalry tactics at the Point.

579
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:19,901
The story is world-wide.

580
01:03:20,003 --> 01:03:22,301
How long have you been out of that school,
Lieutenant?

581
01:03:22,404 --> 01:03:24,065
Graduated class '69, sir.

582
01:03:24,274 --> 01:03:25,797
This is '70, ain't it?

583
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:30,069
I just can't seem to keep up with the years.
I meant to get a calendar, but then I forget.

584
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,011
Say, who's President
of these United States now?

585
01:03:32,115 --> 01:03:33,139
Ulysses S. Grant.

586
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:36,480
You know, I voted once. I was down
in Independence around voting time.

587
01:03:36,586 --> 01:03:40,249
And a fellow come up to me and offered me
$2 if I'd vote for a man named Taylor.

588
01:03:40,356 --> 01:03:41,846
And I was drinking<i>...</i>

589
01:03:41,991 --> 01:03:44,984
drinking a little at the time. And I<i>...</i>
The $2 didn't last<i>...</i>

590
01:03:45,094 --> 01:03:48,394
Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Lane, my orders are
to make a sweep as far as Twin Buttes.

591
01:03:48,498 --> 01:03:51,466
My men'll bivouac here tonight.
We'll go on to Twin Buttes tomorrow...

592
01:03:51,567 --> 01:03:54,058
return tomorrow night to escort you
and your boy out to safety.

593
01:03:54,169 --> 01:03:58,128
If you'll excuse me, madam, I must
see that my men are properly encamped.

594
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:04,540
Very nice and very young.

595
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,012
He for doggone sure is, ma'am.

596
01:04:07,116 --> 01:04:10,415
- How long you been out on this patrol?
- This is the 20th day.

597
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,852
We've rounded up about eight families
back there, that's all there are left.

598
01:04:13,956 --> 01:04:16,016
We're gonna pick them up on the way out.

599
01:04:16,392 --> 01:04:18,155
There've been many a scalp took, Hondo.

600
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,524
- You know where Vittorio is, don't you?
- I do.

601
01:04:20,863 --> 01:04:22,455
This boy Lieutenant's gonna get you killed.

602
01:04:22,564 --> 01:04:25,158
Us scouts has got to get
these young officers educated.

603
01:04:25,268 --> 01:04:27,758
Johnny, go in and set out the plates for me.

604
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:30,065
Hondo, if your friend
would like to eat with us, Mr<i>...</i>

605
01:04:30,172 --> 01:04:32,300
Buffalo? Mr<i>...</i>

606
01:04:32,975 --> 01:04:35,535
I've known you for 8 or 10 years.
You must have a last name.

607
01:04:35,644 --> 01:04:38,374
Well, of course I got a last name,
what do you think I am?

608
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,971
I know what you are,
but there's a lady present.

609
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:44,246
Mrs. Lowe, my name is Baker.
That's what it is, Buffalo Baker.

610
01:04:44,353 --> 01:04:47,220
Well, you may eat with us then, Mr. Baker,
and wash.

611
01:04:47,322 --> 01:04:50,688
There's a basin on the bench
and a towel on the jug, and soap.

612
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:54,454
You know, there is something
about this place<i>...</i>

613
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:56,656
- I know what it reminds me of.
- My ranch.

614
01:04:56,764 --> 01:04:57,993
In California.

615
01:04:58,132 --> 01:05:01,125
I shot a deer right off your front porch
on a butte just like that.

616
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:03,898
With a crick down below
and the mesas all spreading out.

617
01:05:04,006 --> 01:05:05,496
Made me pack it back.

618
01:05:07,209 --> 01:05:10,803
- You have a place that looks like this?
- East of San Dimas.

619
01:05:11,512 --> 01:05:12,741
How wonderful.

620
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:19,918
You're getting to where you kind of
take to that water.

621
01:05:20,022 --> 01:05:21,489
Every time I wash my face...

622
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:24,820
I think of you and that night at Seddon's,
when you whacked me.

623
01:05:25,394 --> 01:05:28,522
You busted off a jaw tooth, and it got to
hurting so bad I had to go to...

624
01:05:28,629 --> 01:05:30,598
the barber and have him dig out
the rest of it.

625
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:33,462
Did I catch you that day,
I'd have set your sun.

626
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:35,964
That's the last morning you'd ever seen.

627
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,937
"Hondo Lane, first prize, Winchester Arms."

628
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,501
Always liked this rifle of yours.
Always wanted one of the new issue myself.

629
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:45,403
Keep your hands off it.

630
01:05:46,114 --> 01:05:49,015
I've known him 10 years, and he's never
spoken a friendly word to me.

631
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:51,415
- I don't like you.
- Figured that.

632
01:05:51,787 --> 01:05:54,551
But now I figure is how he might admire
to give me that rifle.

633
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:59,088
You see, about a half day out of Seddon,
I come across some bodies.

634
01:05:59,193 --> 01:06:01,628
One of them was this here lady's husband.

635
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:04,798
There was a lot of horse tracks
around there.

636
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,333
Some of them belonged
to that there chestnut you were riding.

637
01:06:07,435 --> 01:06:09,699
That one with the cast-off horseshoe.

638
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:13,597
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice
little set-up you got yourself here.

639
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,074
Nice ranch. Pretty woman.

640
01:06:16,177 --> 01:06:18,407
You could get yourself killed talking like this.

641
01:06:18,513 --> 01:06:21,107
Or I could get that
new-fashioned Winchester...

642
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:23,615
since he bushwhacked this lady's husband.

643
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,084
Did she know that,
I figure she wouldn't look at him like...

644
01:06:26,187 --> 01:06:29,554
he was the high cockalorum of every tribe
from here to Salt Water.

645
01:06:30,591 --> 01:06:31,751
Hondo.

646
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:50,867
I tried to tell you.

647
01:06:54,147 --> 01:06:56,172
Mrs. Lowe, we're ready to leave.

648
01:06:56,783 --> 01:06:57,842
Mr. Lane?

649
01:06:58,518 --> 01:06:59,918
- Stridon.
- Yes, sir.

650
01:07:00,021 --> 01:07:02,615
- Form the troops, column of twos.
- Yes, sir.

651
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:06,251
I want you to accompany us
as far as Twin Buttes.

652
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:08,885
Haven't any time to lose,
so I'd be obliged if you'd saddle up.

653
01:07:08,995 --> 01:07:10,826
- I'm not going.
- You're not going?

654
01:07:10,932 --> 01:07:12,490
- That's right.
- But why?

655
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,191
- Gave my word.
- Your word to whom?

656
01:07:14,302 --> 01:07:16,269
- Vittorio.
- Surely a word given to an...

657
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:19,828
- Indian desperado wouldn't be...
- Mister, when I give my word, I keep it.

658
01:07:19,941 --> 01:07:21,498
Now I'll give you a piece of advice...

659
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:24,169
there's only one family
between here and Twin Buttes...

660
01:07:24,277 --> 01:07:26,302
and you're too late to do them any good.

661
01:07:26,414 --> 01:07:30,373
So you better gather up what settlers
you have and hightail it out of here.

662
01:07:30,483 --> 01:07:33,577
Sir, I have my orders,
and these orders will be executed.

663
01:07:34,055 --> 01:07:35,112
Ma'am.

664
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,324
Prepare to mount.

665
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:43,218
Mount.

666
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:46,762
Forward...

667
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:47,958
ho!

668
01:07:58,778 --> 01:08:02,112
- Angie.
- I can't talk now. I have to think.

669
01:08:02,816 --> 01:08:04,647
I'll put your things outside.

670
01:09:05,644 --> 01:09:08,978
- Before I go I want to explain something.
- Yes?

671
01:09:09,783 --> 01:09:12,307
It didn't happen in the low way you heard it.

672
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:16,155
- I didn't bushwhack.
- I never for a moment thought you did.

673
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,585
- But you killed him.
- I didn't have any choice...

674
01:09:19,693 --> 01:09:22,252
- he cut loose at me<i>...</i>
- I should have known that.

675
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:25,853
I should have known you were lying
to make me think well of him.

676
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:29,662
Poor Ed. I guess he wasn't the sort of man
to die well.

677
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,898
Sorry now I hated him so much.

678
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:35,064
I guess he couldn't help
being weak and selfish.

679
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,004
- I just didn't have any choice.
- I know that.

680
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:44,780
You're gonna feel differently about me?

681
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:48,184
No one has any control
over the way they feel.

682
01:09:49,121 --> 01:09:51,954
I'm never going to change
the way I feel about you.

683
01:09:53,258 --> 01:09:54,384
But...

684
01:09:55,094 --> 01:09:56,493
what about him?

685
01:10:02,267 --> 01:10:03,359
Yeah.

686
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,698
Guess there are some things
that just can't<i>...</i>

687
01:10:09,975 --> 01:10:11,670
He's gonna be a good man.

688
01:10:12,811 --> 01:10:16,838
Good spread to his shoulders.
Head works, too.

689
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:22,912
Other night, after you went to sleep,
he crawled up into my bunk...

690
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:25,622
and put his arms around my neck.

691
01:10:26,825 --> 01:10:28,725
Made me feel kind of funny.

692
01:10:29,628 --> 01:10:31,425
Like he was depending on me.

693
01:10:32,364 --> 01:10:34,855
Lot of things I'd rather do than this.

694
01:10:35,034 --> 01:10:36,728
You're going to tell him?

695
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:41,401
If I don't, somebody else will.
And I got a belly full of lies.

696
01:10:47,545 --> 01:10:49,672
Look what I got!

697
01:10:50,548 --> 01:10:53,312
- Hold him by the gills like I showed you.
- Sure.

698
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:58,017
- Johnny, I want to tell you something.
- It's a nice perch, ain't it?

699
01:10:58,122 --> 01:11:00,317
Bass. Remember the shape of its head?

700
01:11:00,426 --> 01:11:03,452
Oh yeah, I forgot.
Bass have a jaw that stick out like this.

701
01:11:04,929 --> 01:11:06,863
What I wanted to tell you is...

702
01:11:06,965 --> 01:11:09,330
while back, a man came at me with a gun.

703
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,727
- I had to kill him.
- Good. Indian?

704
01:11:11,936 --> 01:11:14,962
No, he was a white man, Johnny,
but I didn't have any choice. He<i>...</i>

705
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:20,707
I told you to press down on the shank,
and then you won't stick yourself.

706
01:11:21,013 --> 01:11:22,571
Won't break the hook, either.

707
01:11:23,748 --> 01:11:27,014
Here, bite down on this stick.
That's the way Indian youngsters...

708
01:11:27,118 --> 01:11:28,949
learn not to cry.

709
01:11:36,594 --> 01:11:39,062
- Johnny, this man I killed...
- No!

710
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:45,929
Your ranch in California,
it's far, too far for gossip to travel.

711
01:11:47,306 --> 01:11:49,797
Go wrap your thumb
in some bayberry leaves.

712
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:53,877
You and your silly ideals.

713
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:57,004
You think truth is the most important thing.

714
01:11:57,215 --> 01:11:59,376
- It's the measure of a man.
- Not for a woman.

715
01:11:59,484 --> 01:12:02,783
A man can afford to have noble sentiments
and poses.

716
01:12:03,087 --> 01:12:06,147
But a woman only has the man she marries.
That's her truth.

717
01:12:06,257 --> 01:12:08,725
And if he's no good, that's still her truth.

718
01:12:08,826 --> 01:12:11,818
I married a man who was a liar,
a thief, and a coward.

719
01:12:11,963 --> 01:12:13,988
He was a drunkard and unfaithful.

720
01:12:14,098 --> 01:12:17,795
He only married me to get this ranch, and
then he deserted Johnny and me for good.

721
01:12:17,902 --> 01:12:20,200
And that's your fine truth for you.

722
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,038
- Could I bring Johnny up on that?
- No, I guess you couldn't.

723
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:26,337
And then you come along
and you're good and fine...

724
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:28,911
and everything that Ed
could never hope to be.

725
01:12:29,046 --> 01:12:33,005
And now, with your vanity, you want to spoil
Johnny's chances, and mine?

726
01:12:39,723 --> 01:12:42,818
<i>- Varlebena.</i>
- What?

727
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:46,458
When the Indians wind up their
squaw-seeking ceremony...

728
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:49,556
they only say one word: <i>Varlebena.</i>

729
01:12:50,067 --> 01:12:51,557
It means forever.

730
01:12:56,874 --> 01:12:57,840
Forever.

731
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:26,093
Well, we caught the wild cat.
Give us a hand, will you?

732
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:34,169
I can't understand,
we killed him on the last charge.

733
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:35,266
Vittorio?

734
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,568
They had us surrounded.

735
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:38,307
Could've cut us to pieces,
then they withdrew.

736
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,815
That's why they pulled out.
Anytime their leader is killed...

737
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,475
that means their medicine's bad.

738
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:44,918
- This poor child.
- We're going out with this troop.

739
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:46,648
- Vittorio's dead.
- No, he can't be.

740
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,384
Everybody gets dead, it was his turn.
Now get your possibles.

741
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:50,720
I have some medicine in the cabin.

742
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:51,794
Thank you, Mrs. Lowe, I'd be...

743
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:53,988
eternally grateful
if you'd pass among the men first.

744
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,655
No, you're wounded,
I'm going to fix you up.

745
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,325
Thank you, ma'am.
The men are in worse shape than I am.

746
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,131
Come on, do as he says.
We'll take care of him.

747
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:04,439
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?

748
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:06,006
Dismount the men.

749
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:08,576
- Hitch their horses up to the wagon.
- Yes, sir.

750
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,668
You'll find harness in the barn.

751
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:14,008
Len.

752
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:18,646
- What do you want?
- Take four men and gather the settlers.

753
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,519
We'll probably catch up with you
at Errad Crossing.

754
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:25,394
Wilson, McGrath, Lyon, Johnson.

755
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,890
- How is he?
- He'll make out.

756
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,195
Don't know much. Led us into an ambush.

757
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:36,238
But I ain't ashamed of him nohow.
Bullet holes are in the front of him.

758
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:38,534
All those youngsters from the Point
are like that.

759
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:40,007
They got to learn.

760
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,303
Partly they learn, partly they die.

761
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:44,411
But I gotta float my stick same as you.

762
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:47,176
I never saw one of them
I had to be ashamed of.

763
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,913
Join in and keep moving.

764
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,383
Move it along, there!

765
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,015
Hurry up!

766
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,523
Come on, move along here!

767
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,346
Come on, hurry it up.

768
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,297
Circle the wagons!

769
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,405
Wheel her around.

770
01:16:25,146 --> 01:16:26,808
Hold on!

771
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:56,008
Stay in the wagon.
Keep everybody in the wagons.

772
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,408
And don't unhitch.

773
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:28,002
Hondo!

774
01:17:28,676 --> 01:17:31,873
All this circle's doing is protect the horses.
We gotta turn some wagons over.

775
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:34,448
And stay here? That's what they expect.

776
01:17:34,582 --> 01:17:35,981
We gotta do what they don't expect.

777
01:17:36,082 --> 01:17:38,744
That's why all the heavy artillery's
in Buffalo's wagon.

778
01:17:38,853 --> 01:17:40,320
Buffalo!

779
01:17:42,957 --> 01:17:46,483
Lieutenant, get down. Are you ready, Buff?

780
01:17:46,594 --> 01:17:49,119
- I was born ready.
- Let's go.

781
01:18:55,863 --> 01:18:57,420
Circle the wagons.

782
01:18:58,164 --> 01:18:59,131
Close up.

783
01:19:44,044 --> 01:19:45,671
Stay down!

784
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:46,837
Sergeant!

785
01:20:09,602 --> 01:20:13,300
- I don't want to be an Apache, Mama.
- Now, you be quiet.

786
01:20:13,406 --> 01:20:16,500
We're going to get out all right.
Now, help me, hurry.

787
01:20:26,352 --> 01:20:30,448
- Ready again, Buff?
- As I told you, I was born ready.

788
01:21:08,694 --> 01:21:09,922
Throw me your knife.

789
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:22,600
Get out of here!

790
01:22:30,308 --> 01:22:31,639
All right, Hondo!

791
01:22:34,078 --> 01:22:35,375
They're not following.

792
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,880
Leader's dead.
They'll powwow and pick a new one.

793
01:22:37,983 --> 01:22:41,782
- We're out of trouble if we get a move on.
- And am I going to get to drive?

794
01:22:41,887 --> 01:22:45,379
Before we get to San Dimas,
you'll be a top teamster, son.

795
01:22:49,427 --> 01:22:51,362
- How are you, Lieutenant?
- Fine, thanks to you.

796
01:22:51,462 --> 01:22:55,489
And you're all right, thanks to Lennie.
He shot that Indian offen your back.

797
01:22:55,734 --> 01:22:57,428
- Thanks.
- With your rifle.

798
01:22:57,702 --> 01:22:59,033
It's his.

799
01:22:59,337 --> 01:23:02,204
Don't look like we'll be needing it
much more today.

800
01:23:05,276 --> 01:23:08,473
General Crook will be here
within a month with a large force.

801
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:11,878
- That'll be the end of the Apache.
- Yeah.

802
01:23:13,017 --> 01:23:14,507
End of a way of life.

803
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,610
Too bad, it's a good way.

804
01:23:18,022 --> 01:23:20,148
Wagons forward!
