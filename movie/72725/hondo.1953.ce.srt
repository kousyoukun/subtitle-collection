2
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,523
嘿,妈妈。妈妈!看那。
Hey, Mama. Mom! Look at that.

3
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:01,294
看,妈妈,你看。
Look, Mommy, look.

4
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:12,664
约翰尼!
Johnny!

5
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,792
现在你让妈妈做代言人。记住。
Now you let Mommy do the talking. Remember.

6
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,323
是的,妈妈。
Yes, Mom.

7
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,230
但他没有马。
But he has no horse.

8
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:45,898
没有说话。
No talking.

9
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,691
早上好。
Good morning.

10
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,352
-你看起来像你有麻烦。 - 是的。
- You look like you've had trouble. - Yep.

11
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:13,796
我失去了我的马前几天远离一些印度人。
I lost my horse a few days ago getting away from some Indians.

12
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,958
印度人吗?
Indians?

13
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:18,232
我们昨晚干营Ilano之上。
We made dry camp last night above the Ilano.

14
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,538
萨姆在这里闻起来更阿帕奇人,蹭我。
Sam here smelled more Apaches, nuzzled me up.

15
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:24,735
所以我想把一些我们之间的距离。
So I thought I'd put some miles between us.

16
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,869
但是为什么呢?我们在和平与Apache。
But why? We're at peace with the Apache.

17
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,641
- 我们有一个条约。 - 是的,夫人。
- We have a treaty. - Yes, ma'am.

18
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:32,149
现在我必须把我的新马,借或买一个。
Now I got to get me a new horse, borrow or buy one.

19
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,550
我可以支付你在美国的脚本。我骑调度一般骗子。
I can pay you in United States script. I'm riding a dispatch for General Crook.

20
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,990
- 我的名字叫巷。 - 我是劳夫人。
- My name's Lane. - I'm Mrs. Lowe.

21
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:41,589
我是强尼。
I'm Johnny.

22
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:44,696
- 水看起来诱人。 - 嗯,帮助自己。
- The water sure looks inviting. - Well, help yourself.

23
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:46,629
当心那只狗,儿子。
Watch out for that dog, son.

24
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,302
你能雇佣我或给我一匹马,罗伊太太吗?
Could you hire me or sell me a horse, Mrs. Lowe?

25
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:54,533
当然。我只有耕马,和两只活。
Of course. I've only got plow horses, and two that are only half-broken.

26
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,507
打破他们的手为我是受伤了,不得不去城镇。
The hand that was breaking them for me got hurt and had to go to town.

27
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:03,281
- 你的意思是你住这儿吗?-哦,不。
- You mean you're staying here alone? - Oh, no.

28
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,846
不,我的丈夫是在山上……
No, my husband is up in the hills...

29
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,976
- 工作一些牛。-哦。
- working some cattle. - Oh.

30
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:11,353
他会挑选今天要离开,当我们有一个客人。
He would pick today to be away, when we have a visitor.

31
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:13,422
我喜欢认识他,夫人。
I'd enjoy meeting him, ma'am.

32
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,792
我不会碰那只狗,儿子。他不需要爱抚。
I wouldn't touch that dog, son. He don't take to petting.

33
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,302
现在如果你会允许,夫人,我就看看那些马。
And now if you'll allow, ma'am, I'll take a look at those horses.

34
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:27,167
当然。你会发现一个鞍的谷仓。
Of course. You'll find a saddle over by the barn.

35
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:31,102
与此同时,我将给你点吃的。我想象你饿了。
In the meantime, I'll fix you something to eat. I imagine you're hungry.

36
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,838
我可以吃。谢谢你！
I could eat. Thank you.

37
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:12,444
我很抱歉我的丈夫不得不选择今天去打猎的那些失去了小牛。
I'm so sorry my husband had to pick today to go hunting those lost calves.

38
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:21,618
他很有可能会喜欢有一个人说话。
He would have enjoyed having a man to talk to.

39
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:24,257
我们欢迎游客。
We welcome visitors.

40
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,124
在这里Ionely肯定是正确的。尤其对一个女人。
Must be right Ionely around here. Especially for a woman.

41
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,394
我不介意。我在这里长大。
I don't mind. I was raised here.

42
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,470
- 我可以喂你的狗吗? - 没有,谢谢。
- What can I feed your dog? - Nothing, thanks.

43
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,335
他做了他自己。可以超越任何在兔子的领土。
He makes out by himself. Can outrun any rabbit in the territory.

44
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:40,344
一点儿也不麻烦。
It's no trouble at all.

45
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:45,874
如果你不介意,太太,我宁愿你没有喂他。
If you don't mind, ma'am, I'd rather you didn't feed him.

46
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:50,247
我看到。你不想让他得到进食的习惯从别人。
I see. You don't want him to get in the habit of taking food from anyone else.

47
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,220
嗯,你可以把这个交给他。
Well, you can hand it to him.

48
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:56,460
不,小姐,我不让他吃,要么。山姆的独立。
No, ma'am, I don't feed him, either. Sam's independent.

49
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,630
他不需要任何人。我希望他能保持这种方式。
He doesn't need anybody. I want him to stay that way.

50
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,263
这是一个好方法。
It's a good way.

51
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:06,164
- 每个人都需要别人。 - 是的,夫人。大多数人。
- Everyone needs someone. - Yes, ma'am. Most everyone.

52
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:07,636
太糟糕了,不是吗?
Too bad, isn't it?

53
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:10,040
- 你是一个好厨师,夫人。 - 谢谢你。
- You're a good cook, ma'am. - Thank you.

54
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:13,543
一个女人应该是一个好厨师。好厨师自己。
A woman should be a good cook. Good cook myself.

55
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,707
你为什么不让他当他被卡住了?
Why didn't you get on him when he was stuck?

56
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:47,300
因为我不想让他坐在我从一站开始。
'Cause I didn't want him sitting on me from a standing start.

57
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:49,078
同他住。
Stay with him.

58
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:26,075
你选择了最野蛮的人。
You chose the most savage one.

59
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:28,113
我不会给你一个论点。
I won't give you an argument there.

60
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:29,709
他一直都是一个斗士。
He's always been a fighter.

61
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,948
我不会给一个插镍为马,不会打架。
I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for a horse that wouldn't fight.

62
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:35,525
它让你失望当情况变得艰难。
It lets you down when the going gets tough.

63
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,193
有点单调。
It's a little dull.

64
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:41,163
嗯,我可以做几乎任何事情在一个牧场,但我永远不可能…
Well, I can do almost everything around a ranch, but I never could...

65
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:43,099
把一个边缘一把斧头。
put an edge on an axe.

66
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,326
它在哪儿呢?
Where is it?

67
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,863
-什么? - 的磨刀石。
- What? - The grindstone.

68
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,883
这个农场看起来像是这里一会儿。
This ranch looks like it's been here a little while.

69
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:05,443
是的,我出生在这里。我的丈夫在这里长大,太。
Yes, I was born here. My husband was raised here, too.

70
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:10,491
他是一个孤儿。他的父母被杀在马车队屠杀……
He's an orphan. His parents got killed in a wagon-train massacre...

71
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:12,289
所以我父亲带他在。
so my father took him in.

72
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,922
-方便。-你什么意思?
- Handy. - What do you mean?

73
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,490
好吧,看来这个数字是反对它。
Well, it seems the figures are against it.

74
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:22,338
只有轻的研究员在1000平方英里…
Only young fellow in 1,000 square miles...

75
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,004
只有轻的女孩在1000平方英里。
only young girl in 1,000 square miles.

76
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:30,515
他们会在旋转中超过对方。这就是我的意思。方便的。
They get in a whirl over each other. That's what I meant. Handy.

77
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:33,176
我想这是一个巧合。
I guess it was quite a coincidence.

78
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,246
但是他们说正确的两人要满足的命运的安排。
But they say that the right two people are going to meet by an arrangement of destiny.

79
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,653
你相信,洛太太吗?
You believe that, Mrs. Lowe?

80
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,716
- 是的,我喜欢。 - 有趣。
- Yes, I do. - Interesting.

81
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:56,597
总是沉叶片成日志,儿子。使边缘清洁。
Always sink a blade into a log, son. Keeps the edge clean.

82
00:08:57,774 --> 00:09:00,902
嗯,我想我最好退出失速,回到那匹马。
Well, I guess I'd better quit stalling and get back to that horse.

83
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:02,706
和我可以玩山姆现在?
And can I play with Sam now?

84
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,311
我已经告诉你两次不来。
I've told you twice not to.

85
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,406
但是你做你想做的。
But you do what you wanna do.

86
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:21,561
真的,莱恩先生,如果你知道这狗会咬人,我想……
Really, Mr. Lane, if you knew the dog would bite, I should think...

87
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:25,294
罗伊太太,人学习让钻头。轻人刚学。
Mrs. Lowe, people learn by getting bit. Youngster just learned.

88
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,029
约翰尼。
Johnny.

89
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:35,769
不要碰那个狗了!现在进去把你的小睡。
Don't you ever touch that dog again! Now go in and take your nap.

90
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,748
而我在这,我将鞋这些犁马。
While I'm at it, I'll shoe those plow horses.

91
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:23,053
非常感谢你。他们需要一个修蹄,我猜。
Thank you very much. They do need a shoeing, I guess.

92
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,353
他们做的。
They do.

93
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:28,895
我想我的丈夫的很难找到那些迷路的小腿。
I guess my husband's having a hard time finding those strayed calves.

94
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:30,493
我猜他是。
I guess he is.

95
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,802
也许他不会回家直到今晚……
Perhaps he won't be home until late tonight...

96
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:38,498
或者他可能连山上的营地中,明天来在你死后。
or he may even camp in the hills and come in tomorrow after you're gone.

97
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:42,944
他会因此很抱歉错过我们的一个很少有偶尔的来访者。
He'll be so sorry to have missed one of our very few occasional visitors.

98
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,944
我想我要去照顾约翰尼。
I guess I'll go and look after Johnny.

99
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,117
罗伊太太,你是一个骗子。
Mrs. Lowe, you're a liar.

100
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:54,212
- 和一个全能的可怜的骗子。-我不懂你。
- And an almighty poor liar. - I don't understand you.

101
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,154
这些马没有穿鞋的一两个月。
These horses haven't been shod in a couple of months.

102
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:00,353
这是小事一桩,斧还没有优势,在两个月。
It's a cinch that axe hasn't had an edge on it in two months.

103
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:04,296
和你的茶可以,5磅的茶可以在你的房子是空的。
And your tea can, a five-pound tea can in your house is empty.

104
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,862
你的丈夫已经消失了很长一段时间。
Your husband's been gone a long time.

105
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:09,733
现在,看这里,莱恩先生,我不认为你有任何权利……
Now, look here, Mr. Lane, I don't think you have any right to...

106
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,466
我不谈论权利。我所说的谎言。
I'm not talking about rights. I'm talking about lies.

107
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,439
你为什么对我撒谎,罗伊太太吗?
Why did you lie to me, Mrs. Lowe?

108
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:18,502
是你害怕,也许你就不会和我在这儿安全与你的丈夫了吗?
Were you afraid that maybe you wouldn't be safe here with me with your husband away?

109
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:21,447
- 它吗? - 这部分是它。
- That it? - That's partly it.

110
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:24,910
女人总是图每一个男人的出现希望他们。
Women always figure every man comes along wants them.

111
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,842
-雷恩。 - 是的,夫人?
- Mr. Lane. - Yes, ma'am?

112
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,838
你是对的。我在撒谎。我的丈夫是过期。
You're right. I was lying. My husband is overdue.

113
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:29,416
他应该回家很久以前。
He should have been home long ago.

114
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,348
图阿帕奇人杀了他?
Figure Apaches killed him?

115
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:34,182
当然不是。有一百个可能的解释。
Of course not. There are a hundred possible explanations.

116
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,812
印度人是其中之一。
Indians are one of them.

117
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,255
但是我们在和平与Apache,除了少数……
But we're at peace with the Apache, except for a few...

118
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,122
罗伊太太,如果你有良好的感觉……
Mrs. Lowe, if you've got good sense...

119
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:43,129
你会收拾你和那个男孩的你跟我出来。
you'll pack up you and that boy of yours and come out with me.

120
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:45,631
那是在酝酿麻烦在Apache的小屋。
There's trouble brewing in the Apache lodges.

121
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,463
维托利奥,他们主要的首席,称为战争委员会。
Vittorio, their main chief, called a war council.

122
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,299
一个完整的报告是在分派我携带。
A full report of it is in that dispatch I'm carrying.

123
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:55,341
但是你不知道,我们一直相处得壮观与Apache。
But you don't know, we've always gotten along splendidly with the Apache.

124
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,704
他们喝酒,把他们的马,我们的春天……
They drink and bring their horses to our spring...

125
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,144
在北到野牛追捕。
on their way north to the buffalo hunt.

126
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:05,647
我从没见过伟大的维托利奥,但已经足够的阿帕奇人这里。
I've never seen the great Vittorio, but there've been plenty of Apaches here.

127
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:10,416
我看到伟大的维托利奥,在本条约。
I've seen the great Vittorio, before the treaty.

128
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:16,989
他的马已经40头皮挂在它的鬃毛。
His horse had 40 scalps hung in its mane.

129
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:18,861
这是以前的条约。
That was before the treaty.

130
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:22,433
我们打破了该条约,美国白人。
We broke that treaty, us Whites.

131
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:26,932
没有的话在Apache语言撒谎,并且他们被骗了。
There's no word in the Apache language for lie, and they've been lied to.

132
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,174
如果它们上升,不会有……
If they rise, there won't be...

133
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,302
- 一个白左在领土。 - 他们不会打扰我。
- a White left in the territory. - They won't bother me.

134
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,244
我们,我的意思是。我们总是相处得很好。
Us, I mean. We always got along very well.

135
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,912
我认识的人,男人和他的妻子相处真正好……
People I know, man and his wife, got along real well for...

136
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,688
20。然后有一天……
20 years. Then one day...

137
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,317
她增加了一个大洞,在他…
she upped and blew a hole in him...

138
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,985
大到足以驱动一辆公共马车通过。
big enough to drive a stagecoach through.

139
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,190
她疯了。阿帕切人疯了。
She got mad. The Apaches are mad.

140
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,730
好吧,我没有什么好担心的,我肯定。
Well, I have nothing to worry about, I'm sure.

141
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,992
很高兴被确定。
Nice to be sure.

142
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,706
让开。
Get out of the way.

143
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,439
- 奇怪的狗你有。 - 我没有他。
- Strange dog you have. - I don't have him.

144
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,847
- 你们两个在一起。 - 他依然和我在一起。
- The two of you are together. - He stays with me.

145
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,815
- 他可以闻到了印度在半英里。 - 他气味印第安人吗?我不相信它。
- He can smell an Indian at a half a mile. - He smells Indians? I don't believe it.

146
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,817
当然,很多狗闻到印第安人。你可以教他们。
Sure, lots of dogs smell Indians. You can teach them.

147
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,253
教他们吗?如何?
Teach them? How?

148
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,951
首先你准备一个小狗,然后……
First you get yourself a puppy and then...

149
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,687
你雇佣自己一个驯服的印度和削减一个柳树开关。
you hire yourself a tame Indian and cut a willow switch.

150
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,492
然后你得到印度打小狗……
Then you get the Indian to beat the puppy...

151
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,897
与柳开关四到五次一天。
with a willow switch four or five times a day.

152
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,801
当他长大了,他会总是信号当他闻到一个印度。
And when he grows up, he'll always signal when he smells an Indian.

153
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,169
打一只小狗。多么残忍。
Beat a puppy. How cruel.

154
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,236
这是他们的方式做它。
That's the way they do it.

155
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,708
无论如何,我不相信狗能闻到印第安人。
Anyway, I don't believe a dog can smell Indians.

156
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,972
我的意思是,不同于其他任何人。
I mean, as different from anyone else.

157
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,878
- 你或我,例如。 - 好吧,他们可以。
- You or me, for instance. - Well, they can.

158
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,076
作为一个事实,印度人能闻到白人。
As a matter of fact, Indians can smell White people.

159
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,483
- 我不相信它。 - 好吧,这是真的。
- I don't believe it. - Well, it's true.

160
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:52,386
我有部分印度,我能闻到你当我顺风的你。
I'm part Indian, and I can smell you when I'm downwind of you.

161
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:59,465
- 那是不可能的。 - 不,它不是不可能的,劳夫人。
- That's impossible. - No, it isn't impossible, Mrs. Lowe.

162
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,700
你烤的今天。我可以闻到新鲜的面包在你。
You baked today. I can smell fresh bread on you.

163
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,604
今天你煮的某个时候和咸肉。
Sometime today you cooked with salt pork.

164
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,844
闻,你,太。
Smell that on you, too.

165
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,850
你闻起来都像肥皂。
You smell all over like soap.

166
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:24,749
你洗个澡。和最重要的是,你闻起来都像一个女人。
You took a bath. And on top of that, you smell all over like a woman.

167
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:30,457
我能找到你在黑暗中,罗伊太太,我只有部分印度。
I could find you in the dark, Mrs. Lowe, and I'm only part Indian.

168
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,732
罗伊太太。
Mrs. Lowe.

169
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,708
你想要什么?
What do you want?

170
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,640
- 我浇水和粒度的股票。 - 谢谢你。
- I watered and grained the stock. - Thank you.

171
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,849
我将睡在附近某处今晚。
I'll bed down near here someplace tonight.

172
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,614
Lane先生吗?
Mr. Lane?

173
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,821
你不能在外面过夜,暴风雨就要来了。
You can't sleep outside, there's a storm coming.

174
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,430
我已经修正了托盘给你在角落里。
I've fixed a pallet for you in the corner.

175
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,965
这将是未开化的让任何人睡在外面……
It would be uncivilized to let anyone sleep outside...

176
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,544
毕竟,我们是文明的,不是吗?
and after all, we are civilized, aren't we?

177
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,204
为你说话,当然。但我呢?
Speaking for you, of course. But me?

178
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,177
我猜你会叫我文明。
I guess you could call me civilized.

179
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,849
那是你的床。我很抱歉必须在地板上。
That's your bed. I'm sorry it has to be on the floor.

180
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:12,525
我已经设置为早上面糊。我希望不会打扰你的噪音。
I have to set the batter for the morning. I hope the noise won't disturb you.

181
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,160
它不会。
It won't.

182
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,768
晚上好,夫人。
Good night, ma'am.

183
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,658
你把枪放下。
Put that gun down.

184
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,822
你是本州巷,枪手。
You're Hondo Lane, the gunman.

185
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,562
- 我带着枪。 - 别再接近。
- I carry a gun. - Don't come any nearer.

186
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:55,568
你杀了三个人在去一场枪战。
You killed three men in a gunfight last year.

187
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:58,141
- 我们听说过。三个男人。 - 是的,夫人。
- We heard about it. Three men. - Yes, ma'am.

188
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:01,140
- 就像快我可以。 - 别再接近。
- Just as quick as I could. - Don't come any nearer.

189
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:06,448
这不是一个好主意点这些东西之一在任何人……
It's not a very good idea to point one of these things at anybody...

190
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:09,042
用一个空腔在撞针。
with an empty chamber under the firing pin.

191
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,185
你可以看到它像天纯。
You can see it plain as day.

192
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,084
我保持这种方式,因为约翰尼。
I keep it that way because of Johnny.

193
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:15,956
嗯,现在它的加载。
Well, now it's loaded.

194
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:19,391
保持这种方式,保持高。
Keep it that way, and keep it high.

195
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:34,141
请留下来。我真的想要你。
Please stay. I really want you to.

196
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:39,577
我很抱歉。我应该意识到从一开始,你是一个绅士。
I'm sorry. I should have realized from the beginning that you are a gentleman.

197
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:48,356
文明吗?绅士?
Civilized? Gentleman?

198
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,224
嗯,很多一天。
Well, a lot for one day.

199
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,566
晚上,女士。
Night, ma'am.

200
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:22,021
早.... 早起。
Morning. Getting an early start.

201
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:26,087
一定要告诉那个小男人再见我。
Be sure and tell that little man goodbye for me.

202
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:28,664
我应该叫醒他向你告别。
I ought to wake him to say goodbye to you.

203
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,823
这是我,我让他睡。
Was it me, I'd let him sleep.

204
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:34,371
轻人成长睡觉,但是你做你想做的事。
Youngsters grow sleeping, but you do what you want to.

205
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,073
他是如此的高兴,你为他吹口哨。
He was so delighted with that whistle you made for him.

206
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:42,237
很高兴听到它。他和我相处很好。
Glad to hear it. He and I got along just fine.

207
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,540
它更像是一个比一个哨子吹长笛。它的范围几乎完整的规模。
It's more like a flute than a whistle. It ranges almost the full scale.

208
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:50,046
我学会了让他们当我是活在Mescalero。
I learned to make them when I was living with the Mescalero.

209
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:53,122
我的妻子用来使他们对每个孩子都在小屋。
My squaw used to make them for every kid in the lodge.

210
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:57,388
- 你住与Apache吗?- 5。
- You lived with the Apache? - Five years.

211
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:01,358
- 和你有一个印度的妻子吗? - 妻子,妻子...
- And you had an Indian wife? - Wife, squaw<i>...</i>

212
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:06,234
我随意的借几英尺的绳索从,线圈在披屋。
I took the liberty of borrowing a few feet of rope off of that coil in the lean-to.

213
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:10,001
- 为它付你钱的,如果你让我。 - “当然不。
- Gladly pay you for it, if you let me. - 'Course not.

214
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,833
今天的山是如此美丽。
The hills are so beautiful today.

215
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:16,276
怎么奇怪清楚他们总是在沙尘暴。
Odd how clear they always are after a dust storm.

216
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:22,582
一定是很有趣的生活与Apache。
Must have been very interesting living with the Apache.

217
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:24,182
我很喜欢它。
I liked it.

218
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:29,748
- 这个印度的妻子你有...。- 她死了。
- This Indian wife you have<i>...</i> - Had. She's dead.

219
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,186
我很抱歉。我不是有意要抚养一个不愉快的回忆。
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up an unhappy memory.

220
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:40,670
我不记得任何事情Destarte不满。
I can't remember anything unhappy about Destarte.

221
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:45,597
Destarte吗? 怎样的音乐。这意味着什么呢?
Destarte? How musical. What does it mean?

222
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:51,781
你不能说它在Mescalero除外。这意味着早上。
You can't say it except in Mescalero. It means morning.

223
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,243
但这并不意味着什么,要么。
But that isn't what it means, either.

224
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:59,921
不仅仅意味着,。印度的字的意思是声音和…
Means more than just that. Indian words mean the sound and...

225
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,085
一个单词的感觉,就像……
feel of a word, like...

226
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:05,792
黎明,第一个青铜灯……
crack of dawn, the first bronze light...

227
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:09,456
这使山丘坚决反对灰色的沙漠。
that makes the buttes stand out against the gray desert.

228
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,564
你听到的第一个声音的一条小溪……
The first sound you hear of a brook...

229
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,363
在一些岩石冰壶,鲑鱼跳跃。
curling over some rocks, with trout jumping.

230
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:19,599
这就像当你起床在第一光……
It's like when you get up in the first light...

231
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:24,242
只有你和她,你离开一个窝棚。
just you and her and you go out of a wickiup.

232
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:29,680
它闻起来种烟熏和私人,只有你和她,……
Where it smells kind of smoky and private, just you and her, and...

233
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,983
种安全只有你们两个。
kind of safe with just the two of you.

234
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,656
站在外面……
Stand outside and...

235
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:39,788
觉得咬下来的第一个风从高分裂……
feel the bite of the first wind coming down from the high divide...

236
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,458
承诺的降雪。
that promises snowfall.

237
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:48,228
不能用英语说,但那是她的名字。
Can't say it in English, but that was her name.

238
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:50,765
Destarte。
Destarte.

239
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:57,268
- 你让我想起她一些。 - 印度的一个女孩?
- You remind me of her some. - Of an Indian girl?

240
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,270
她是公平的吗?
Was she fair?

241
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,915
她的头发是黑如10英尺下降。
Her hair was black as 10 feet down.

242
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:05,752
你有没有看到一只乌鸦的翅膀,黑色和闪闪发光的吗?
Did you ever see a crow's wing, how black and gleaming it is?

243
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:08,049
- 是的。 - 她的头发擦过。
- Yes. - That's the way her hair shined.

244
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:10,950
我想付你的绳索。
I'd like to pay you for that rope.

245
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,086
骑调度,我有权给美国脚本。
Riding dispatch, I have the right to give U.S. Script.

246
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,322
- 你爱她吗? - 我不知道。
- You loved her? - I don't know.

247
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:20,965
我需要她。
I needed her.

248
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:29,170
- 但如果她是黑暗和我公平… - 为什么你让我想起她吗?
- But if she was dark and I'm fair... - Why you reminded me of her?

249
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,643
- 是的。 - 我不知道。
- Yes. - I don't know.

250
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,111
我想到它。你看起来不像她的东西。
I thought about it. You don't look anything like her.

251
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:38,748
我完全意识到我是一个平凡的女人,雷恩。
I am fully aware that I am a homely woman, Mr. Lane.

252
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:40,343
我不是那个意思。
I didn't mean that.

253
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:43,856
我有一个坏习惯,实话实说。但漂亮并不多。
I have a bad habit of telling the truth. But being pretty isn't much.

我认识他十,他从来没有对我说一个友好的话。
I've known him 10 years, and he's never spoken a friendly word to me.

632
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:51,415
- 我不喜欢你。 - 认为。
- I don't like you. - Figured that.

633
01:05:51,787 --> 01:05:54,551
但是现在我图是他可能很想给我那步枪。
But now I figure is how he might admire to give me that rifle.

634
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:59,088
你看,约半天了,我遇到一些Seddon尸体。
You see, about a half day out of Seddon, I come across some bodies.

635
01:05:59,193 --> 01:06:01,628
其中之一是这个女士的丈夫。
One of them was this here lady's husband.

636
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:04,798
有许多马在赛道。
There was a lot of horse tracks around there.

637
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,333
其中一些属于,栗你骑。
Some of them belonged to that there chestnut you were riding.

638
01:06:07,435 --> 01:06:09,699
这一遭遗弃的马蹄。
That one with the cast-off horseshoe.

639
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:13,597
是的,先生,这是一个强大的漂亮小设置你有自己这里。
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice little set-up you got yourself here.

640
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,074
漂亮的农场。漂亮的女人。
Nice ranch. Pretty woman.

641
01:06:16,177 --> 01:06:18,407
你可以让自己死亡这样的谈话。
You could get yourself killed talking like this.

642
01:06:18,513 --> 01:06:21,107
或者我可以得到新型温彻斯特……
Or I could get that new-fashioned Winchester...

643
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:23,615
自从他bushwhacked这女士的丈夫。
since he bushwhacked this lady's husband.

644
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,084
她才知道,我想她不会看他像……
Did she know that, I figure she wouldn't look at him like...

645
01:06:26,187 --> 01:06:29,554
他是高的小公鸡每支派的从这里到盐的水。
he was the high cockalorum of every tribe from here to Salt Water.

646
01:06:30,591 --> 01:06:31,751
本州。
Hondo.

647
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:50,867
我想告诉你。
I tried to tell you.

648
01:06:54,147 --> 01:06:56,172
罗伊太太,我们准备离开。
Mrs. Lowe, we're ready to leave.

649
01:06:56,783 --> 01:06:57,842
Lane先生吗?
Mr. Lane?

650
01:06:58,518 --> 01:06:59,918
- Stridon。 -是的,先生。
- Stridon. - Yes, sir.

651
01:07:00,021 --> 01:07:02,615
- 构成了部队,列的两个。-是的,先生。
- Form the troops, column of twos. - Yes, sir.

652
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:06,251
我希望你能陪我们到双峰。
I want you to accompany us as far as Twin Buttes.

653
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:08,885
没有时间浪费了,所以我很感激如果你会套上马鞍。
Haven't any time to lose, so I'd be obliged if you'd saddle up.

654
01:07:08,995 --> 01:07:10,826
-我不会。 - 你不会吗?
- I'm not going. - You're not going?

655
01:07:10,932 --> 01:07:12,490
- 没错。 - 但是为什么呢?
- That's right. - But why?

656
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,191
- 给我的字。-你的话给谁?
- Gave my word. - Your word to whom?

657
01:07:14,302 --> 01:07:16,269
-维托利奥。 - 显然是一个词给一个……
- Vittorio. - Surely a word given to an...

658
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:19,828
- 印度暴徒也不会…… - 先生,当我给我的话,我把它。
- Indian desperado wouldn't be... - Mister, when I give my word, I keep it.

659
01:07:19,941 --> 01:07:21,498
现在我将给你一个忠告…
Now I'll give you a piece of advice...

660
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:24,169
只有一个家庭在这里之间和双峰……
there's only one family between here and Twin Buttes...

661
01:07:24,277 --> 01:07:26,302
和你太迟去做什么好。
and you're too late to do them any good.

662
01:07:26,414 --> 01:07:30,373
所以你最好收集什么移民你然后和离开这里。
So you better gather up what settlers you have and hightail it out of here.

663
01:07:30,483 --> 01:07:33,577
先生,我有我的订单,这些订单将被执行。
Sir, I have my orders, and these orders will be executed.

664
01:07:34,055 --> 01:07:35,112
太太。
Ma'am.

665
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,324
准备挂载。
Prepare to mount.

666
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:43,218
挂载。
Mount.

667
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:46,762
向前……
Forward...

668
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:47,958
喂!
ho!

669
01:07:58,778 --> 01:08:02,112
- 安吉。 - 我现在不能和你谈。我不得不认为。
- Angie. - I can't talk now. I have to think.

670
01:08:02,816 --> 01:08:04,647
我要把你的东西外。
I'll put your things outside.

671
01:09:05,644 --> 01:09:08,978
- 我走之前我想解释什么。 - 是吗?
- Before I go I want to explain something. - Yes?

672
01:09:09,783 --> 01:09:12,307
它没有发生在你听到它的低。
It didn't happen in the low way you heard it.

673
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:16,155
- 我没有奇袭。 - 我决不认为你做的。
- I didn't bushwhack. - I never for a moment thought you did.

674
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,585
- 但你杀了他。 - 我没有任何选择……
- But you killed him. - I didn't have any choice...

675
01:09:19,693 --> 01:09:22,252
- 他割断我...   - 我应该知道。
- he cut loose at me<i>...</i> - I should have known that.

676
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:25,853
我应该知道你在撒谎,让我觉得他的好话。
I should have known you were lying to make me think well of him.

677
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:29,662
可怜的艾德。我猜他不是那种人死好。
Poor Ed. I guess he wasn't the sort of man to die well.

678
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,898
对不起现在我恨他那么多。
Sorry now I hated him so much.

679
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:35,064
我想他不能帮助懦弱和自私。
I guess he couldn't help being weak and selfish.

680
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,004
-我只是没有任何选择。 - 我知道。
- I just didn't have any choice. - I know that.

681
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:44,780
你会对我有不同的感觉吗?
You're gonna feel differently about me?

682
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:48,184
没有人控制他们的感受。
No one has any control over the way they feel.

683
01:09:49,121 --> 01:09:51,954
我永远不会改变我对你的感觉。
I'm never going to change the way I feel about you.

684
01:09:53,258 --> 01:09:54,384
但是……
But...

685
01:09:55,094 --> 01:09:56,493
他怎么样?
what about him?

686
01:10:02,267 --> 01:10:03,359
是的。
Yeah.

687
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,698
想有些事情不能<我> < / i >…
Guess there are some things that just can't<i>...</i>

688
01:10:09,975 --> 01:10:11,670
他会是一个好男人。
He's gonna be a good man.

689
01:10:12,811 --> 01:10:16,838
良好的扩散到他的肩膀。头工作,太。
Good spread to his shoulders. Head works, too.

690
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:22,912
其他的夜晚,在你去睡眠,他爬到我的床铺……
Other night, after you went to sleep, he crawled up into my bunk...

691
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:25,622
,双手环抱着我的脖子。
and put his arms around my neck.

692
01:10:26,825 --> 01:10:28,725
让我觉得有些可笑。
Made me feel kind of funny.

693
01:10:29,628 --> 01:10:31,425
就像他是取决于我。
Like he was depending on me.

694
01:10:32,364 --> 01:10:34,855
很多事情我宁愿做。
Lot of things I'd rather do than this.

695
01:10:35,034 --> 01:10:36,728
你会告诉他吗?
You're going to tell him?

696
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:41,401
如果我不这样做,别人会。和我有一个肚子充满谎言。
If I don't, somebody else will. And I got a belly full of lies.

697
01:10:47,545 --> 01:10:49,672
看这是什么!
Look what I got!

698
01:10:50,548 --> 01:10:53,312
- 把他的腮像我显示你。 - 确定。
- Hold him by the gills like I showed you. - Sure.

699
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:58,017
- 约翰尼,我想告诉你一件事。 - 这是一个不错的鲈鱼,不是吗?
- Johnny, I want to tell you something. - It's a nice perch, ain't it?

700
01:10:58,122 --> 01:11:00,317
低音。记住它的头的形状吗?
Bass. Remember the shape of its head?

701
01:11:00,426 --> 01:11:03,452
哦,我忘了。低音有颚,坚持这样。
Oh yeah, I forgot. Bass have a jaw that stick out like this.

702
01:11:04,929 --> 01:11:06,863
我想告诉你的是…
What I wanted to tell you is...

703
01:11:06,965 --> 01:11:09,330
不久以前,一个男人用枪向我扑来。
while back, a man came at me with a gun.

704
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,727
- 我必须杀了他。 - 好的。印度人吗?
- I had to kill him. - Good. Indian?

705
01:11:11,936 --> 01:11:14,962
不,他是一个白人,约翰尼,但我没有任何的选择。他的<我> < / i >…
No, he was a white man, Johnny, but I didn't have any choice. He<i>...</i>

706
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:20,707
我告诉你向下按柄,然后你不会坚持你自己。
I told you to press down on the shank, and then you won't stick yourself.

707
01:11:21,013 --> 01:11:22,571
不会打破钩,要么。
Won't break the hook, either.

708
01:11:23,748 --> 01:11:27,014
在这里,这种棍子咬东西。这是印度的轻人……
Here, bite down on this stick. That's the way Indian youngsters...

709
01:11:27,118 --> 01:11:28,949
学习不要哭。
learn not to cry.

710
01:11:36,594 --> 01:11:39,062
- 约翰,这个人我杀了…… - 不!
- Johnny, this man I killed... - No!

711
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:45,929
你在加州的农场,它得太远,对八卦去旅行。
Your ranch in California, it's far, too far for gossip to travel.

712
01:11:47,306 --> 01:11:49,797
去把你的拇指在一些杨梅树叶。
Go wrap your thumb in some bayberry leaves.

713
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:53,877
你和你的愚蠢的理想。
You and your silly ideals.

714
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:57,004
你认为真理是最重要的事情。
You think truth is the most important thing.

715
01:11:57,215 --> 01:11:59,376
- 这是衡量一个人。 - 不是一个女人。
- It's the measure of a man. - Not for a woman.

716
01:11:59,484 --> 01:12:02,783
一个男人可以有高尚的情操和姿势。
A man can afford to have noble sentiments and poses.

717
01:12:03,087 --> 01:12:06,147
但是一个女人只有结婚的男人。那是她的真相。
But a woman only has the man she marries. That's her truth.

718
01:12:06,257 --> 01:12:08,725
如果他是没有好处的,那是她的真相仍然。
And if he's no good, that's still her truth.

719
01:12:08,826 --> 01:12:11,818
我嫁给了一个人,一个骗子,一个小偷,一个懦夫。
I married a man who was a liar, a thief, and a coward.

720
01:12:11,963 --> 01:12:13,988
他是一个酒鬼和不忠。
He was a drunkard and unfaithful.

721
01:12:14,098 --> 01:12:17,795
他只有结婚我得到这农场,然后他抛弃了约翰尼和我好。
He only married me to get this ranch, and then he deserted Johnny and me for good.

722
01:12:17,902 --> 01:12:20,200
和那是你对你罚款真理。
And that's your fine truth for you.

723
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,038
- 我能把约翰尼在那? - 不,我猜你不能。
- Could I bring Johnny up on that? - No, I guess you couldn't.

724
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:26,337
然后你过来和你很好,很好……”
And then you come along and you're good and fine...

725
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:28,911
和一切不可能希望埃德。
and everything that Ed could never hope to be.

726
01:12:29,046 --> 01:12:33,005
现在,你的虚荣心,你想破坏约翰尼的机会,和我的吗?
And now, with your vanity, you want to spoil Johnny's chances, and mine?

727
01:12:39,723 --> 01:12:42,818
Varlebena。 -什么?
<i>- Varlebena.</i> - What?

728
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:46,458
当印度人卷起他们的女人寻求仪式……
When the Indians wind up their squaw-seeking ceremony...

729
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:49,556
他们只说一个词: Varlebena。
they only say one word: <i>Varlebena.</i>

730
01:12:50,067 --> 01:12:51,557
这意味着永远。
It means forever.

731
01:12:56,874 --> 01:12:57,840
永远的。
Forever.

732
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:26,093
嗯,我们抓住了野猫。帮我们一把,可以吗?
Well, we caught the wild cat. Give us a hand, will you?

733
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:34,169
我不能理解,我们杀了他的最后一个电荷。
I can't understand, we killed him on the last charge.

734
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:35,266
维托利奥?
Vittorio?

735
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,568
他们把我们包围。
They had us surrounded.

736
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:38,307
可以把我们的碎片,然后他们撤回了。
Could've cut us to pieces, then they withdrew.

737
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,815
这就是为什么他们退出。任何时候他们的领袖被杀……
That's why they pulled out. Anytime their leader is killed...

738
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,475
这意味着他们的医学的坏。
that means their medicine's bad.

739
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:44,918
- 这个可怜的孩子。 - 我们要和这个队伍。
- This poor child. - We're going out with this troop.

740
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:46,648
-维托利奥死了。 - 不,他不能。
- Vittorio's dead. - No, he can't be.

741
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,384
每个人都死了,轮到他。现在让你的可能性。
Everybody gets dead, it was his turn. Now get your possibles.

742
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:50,720
我有一些药在机舱内。
I have some medicine in the cabin.

743
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:51,794
谢谢你,夫人,我是…劳
Thank you, Mrs. Lowe, I'd be...

744
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:53,988
非常感激如果你会通过人们在第一。
eternally grateful if you'd pass among the men first.

745
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,655
不,你受伤了,我要修理你。
No, you're wounded, I'm going to fix you up.

746
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,325
谢谢你,夫人。这个男人比我陷入更糟糕的境地。
Thank you, ma'am. The men are in worse shape than I am.

747
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,131
来,照他说的做。我们会照顾好他的。
Come on, do as he says. We'll take care of him.

748
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:04,439
- 军士。-是的,先生?
- Sergeant. - Yes, sir?

749
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:06,006
拆卸。男人
Dismount the men.

750
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:08,576
- 结马的马车。-是的,先生。
- Hitch their horses up to the wagon. - Yes, sir.

751
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,668
你会发现的牲口棚里面。
You'll find harness in the barn.

752
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:14,008
莱恩。
Len.

753
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:18,646
你想要什么? - 采取四个男人和收集定居者。
- What do you want? - Take four men and gather the settlers.

754
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,519
我们可能会赶上你Errad穿越。
We'll probably catch up with you at Errad Crossing.

755
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:25,394
威尔逊,麦格拉思,里昂,约翰逊。
Wilson, McGrath, Lyon, Johnson.

756
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,890
- 他是如何? - 他会出。

But I ain't ashamed of him nohow. Bullet holes are in the front of him.

所有这些轻人从点就是这样。
All those youngsters from the Point are like that.

他们学习的部分,部分原因是他们死。

但是我得浮我坚持和你一样。

本州!

所有这些圆的做的是保护马。我们得把一些马车了。
All this circle's doing is protect the horses. We gotta turn some wagons over.

和呆在这儿吗?这就是他们的期望。

777

我们必须做他们不期望。

这就是为什么所有的重型火炮的在布法罗的马车。
That's why all the heavy artillery's in Buffalo's wagon.

滚开!
Get out of here!

好吧,本州!
All right, Hondo!

792
01:22:34,078 --> 01:22:35,375
他们不遵循。
