1
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,242
Hey, Mama. Mom! Look at that.

2
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,995
Look, Mommy, look.

3
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,381
Johnny!

4
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,489
Now you let Mommy do the talking.
Remember.

5
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,074
Yes, Mom.

6
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,955
But he has no horse.

7
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,623
No talking.

8
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,436
Good morning.

9
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,064
-You look like you've had trouble.
-Yep.

10
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,526
l lost my horse a few days ago
getting away from some Indians.

11
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,652
Indians?

12
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,947
We made dry camp last night
above the llano.

13
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,243
Sam here smelt more Apaches,
nuzzled me up.

14
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,412
So l thought l'd put some miles
between us.

15
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,539
But why?
We're at peace with the Apache.

16
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,332
-We have a treaty.
-Yes, ma'am.

17
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,794
Now l got to get me a new horse,
borrow or buy one.

18
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:36,257
l can pay you in United States script.
I'm riding a dispatch for General Crook.

19
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,635
-My name's Lane.
-I’m Mrs. Lowe.

20
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,304
I’m Johnny.

21
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,390
-The water sure looks inviting.
-Well, help yourself.

22
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,309
Watch out for that dog, son.

23
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,979
Could you hire me or sell me a horse,
Mrs. Lowe?

24
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:54,191
Of course. I've only got plow horses,
and two that are only half-broken.

25
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,154
The hand that was breaking them
for me got hurt and had to go to town.

26
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,992
-You mean you're staying here alone?
-Oh, no.

27
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,494
No, my husband is up in the hills,

28
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,663
-working some cattle.
-Oh.

29
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,000
He would pick today to be away,
when we have a visitor.

30
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,127
l'd enjoy meeting him, ma'am.

31
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,508
l wouldn't touch that dog, son.
He don't take to petting.

32
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,971
And now if you'll allow, ma'am,
I'll take a look at those horses.

33
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,849
Of course.
You'll find a saddle over by the barn.

34
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,770
In the meantime, I’ll fix you something
to eat. l imagine you're hungry.

35
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,521
l could eat. Thank you.

36
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:12,144
I’m so sorry my husband had to pick
today to go hunting those lost calves.

37
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,320
He would have enjoyed
having a man to talk to.

38
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,906
We welcome visitors.

39
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,827
Must be right lonely around here.
Especially for a woman.

40
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,079
l don't mind. l was raised here.

41
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,166
-What can l feed your dog?
-Nothing, thanks.

42
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,004
He makes out by himself.
Can outrun any rabbit in the territory.

43
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,047
It's no trouble at all.

44
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,594
lf you don't mind, ma'am,
l'd rather you didn't feed him.

45
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,932
l see. You don't want him to get in the
habit of taking food from anyone else.

46
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,934
Well, you can hand it to him.

47
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,105
No, ma'am, l don't feed him, either.
Sam's independent.

48
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,275
He doesn't need anybody.
l want him to stay that way.

49
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,943
It’s a good way.

50
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,865
-Everyone needs someone.
-Yes, ma'am. Most everyone.

51
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,283
Too bad, isn't it?

52
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,702
-You're a good cook, ma'am.
-Thank you.

53
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,247
A woman should be a good cook.
Good cook myself.

54
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,402
Why didn't you get on him
when he was stuck?

55
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,989
'Cause l didn't want him sitting on me
from a standing start.

56
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,783
Stay with him.

57
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,736
You chose the most savage one.

58
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,780
l won't give you an argument there.

59
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,365
He's always been a fighter.

60
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,618
l wouldn't give a plugged nickel
for a horse that wouldn't fight.

61
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,204
It lets you down
when the going gets tough.

62
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,832
It’s a little dull.

63
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,127
Well, l can do almost everything
around a ranch, but l never could

64
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,753
put an edge on an ax.

65
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,004
Where is it?

66
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,507
-What?
-The grindstone.

67
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,522
This ranch looks like it's been here
a little while.

68
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,109
Yes, l was born here.
My husband was raised here, too.

69
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,156
He's an orphan. His parents got killed
in a wagon-train massacre,

70
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,949
so my father took him in.

71
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,577
-Handy.
-What do you mean?

72
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,164
Well, it seems the figures are against it.

73
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,001
Only young fellow
in 1 ,000 square miles,

74
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,671
only young girl in 1 ,000 square miles.

75
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:30,134
They get in a whirl over each other.
That's what l meant. Handy.

76
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,845
l guess it was quite a coincidence.

77
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,556
But they say that the right two people
are going to meet

78
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,100
by an arrangement of destiny.

79
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,311
You believe that, Mrs. Lowe?

80
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,397
-Yes, l do.
-Interesting.

81
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:56,243
Always sink a blade into a log, son.
Keeps the edge clean.

82
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,581
Well, l guess l'd better quit stalling
and get back to that horse.

83
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,499
And can l play with Sam now?

84
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,960
I’ve told you twice not to.

85
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,129
But you do what you wanna do.

86
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,352
Really, Mr. Lane, if you knew
the dog would bite, l should think...

87
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,064
Mrs. Lowe, people learn by getting bit.
Youngster just learned.

88
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,816
Johnny.

89
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,574
Don't you ever touch that dog again!
Now go in and take your nap.

90
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,535
While I’m at it,
I’ll shoe those plow horses.

91
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,788
Thank you very much.
They do need a shoeing, l guess.

92
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,123
They do.

93
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,669
l guess my husband's having a hard
time finding those strayed calves.

94
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,296
l guess he is.

95
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,549
Perhaps he won't be home
until late tonight,

96
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:38,304
or he may even camp in the hills and
come in tomorrow after you're gone.

97
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:42,725
He'll be so sorry to have missed
one of our very few occasional visitors.

98
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,771
l guess I’ll go and look after Johnny.

99
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,898
Mrs. Lowe, you're a liar.

100
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,986
-And an almighty poor liar.
-l don't understand you.

101
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,947
These horses haven't been shod
in a couple of months.

102
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,159
It’s a cinch that ax hasn't had
an edge on it in two months.

103
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,079
And your tea can, a five-pound tea can
in your house is empty.

104
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,665
Your husband's been gone a long time.

105
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,501
Now, look here, Mr. Lane,
l don't think you have any right to...

106
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,254
I’m not talking about rights.
I’m talking about lies.

107
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,173
Why did you lie to me, Mrs. Lowe?

108
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,675
Were you afraid that maybe
you wouldn't be safe here with me

109
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,302
with your husband away?

110
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,221
-That it?
-That's partly it.

111
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,683
Women always figure every man
comes along wants them.

112
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,618
-Mr. Lane.
-Yes, ma'am?

113
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,621
You're right. l was lying.
My husband is overdue.

114
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,206
He should have been home long ago.

115
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,125
Figure Apaches killed him?

116
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,961
Of course not. There are a hundred
possible explanations.

117
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,587
Indians are one of them.

118
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,048
But we're at peace with the Apache,
except for a few...

119
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,883
Mrs. Lowe, if you've got good sense,

120
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,886
you'll pack up you and that boy of yours
and come out with me.

121
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,389
There's trouble brewing
in the Apache lodges.

122
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,225
Vittorio, their main chief,
called a war council.

123
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,061
A full report of it is in that dispatch
I’m carrying.

124
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:55,107
But you don't know, we've always
gotten along splendidly with the Apache.

125
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,485
They drink and bring their horses
to our spring

126
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,904
on their way north to the buffalo hunt.

127
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,409
I’ve never seen the great Vittorio, but
there've been plenty of Apaches here.

128
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,205
I’ve seen the great Vittorio,
before the treaty.

129
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,753
His horse had 40 scalps
hung in its mane.

130
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,630
That was before the treaty.

131
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,217
We broke that treaty, us Whites.

132
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,304
There's no word
in the Apache language for lie,

133
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,889
and they've been lied to.

134
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,932
lf they rise, there won't be

135
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,102
-a White left in the territory.
-They won't bother me.

136
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,022
Us, l mean.
We always got along very well.

137
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,692
People l know, man and his wife,
got along real well for

138
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,445
20 years. Then one day,

139
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,114
she upped and blew a hole in him,

140
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,783
big enough to drive
a stagecoach through.

141
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,953
She got mad. The Apaches are mad.

142
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,748
Well, l have nothing to worry about,
I’m sure.

143
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,792
Nice to be sure.

144
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,464
Get out of the way.

145
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,218
-Strange dog you have.
-l don't have him.

146
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,638
-The two of you are together.
-He stays with me.

147
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,601
-He can smell an Indian at a half a mile.
-He smells Indians? l don't believe it.

148
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,604
Sure, lots of dogs smell Indians.
You can teach them.

149
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,022
Teach them? How?

150
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,733
First you get yourself a puppy and then,

151
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,487
you hire yourself a tame Indian
and cut a willow switch.

152
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,280
Then you get the Indian
to beat the puppy

153
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,658
with a willow switch four or five times
a day.

154
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,578
And when he grows up, he'll always
signal when he smells an Indian.

155
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,956
Beat a puppy. How cruel.

156
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,999
That's the way they do it.

157
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,502
Anyway, l don't believe
a dog can smell Indians.

158
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,754
l mean, as different from anyone else.

159
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,673
-You or me, for instance.
-Well, they can.

160
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,841
As a matter of fact,
Indians can smell White people.

161
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,261
-l don't believe it.
-Well, it's true.

162
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:52,182
I’m part Indian, and l can smell you
when I’m downwind of you.

163
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,231
-That's impossible.
-No, it isn't impossible, Mrs. Lowe.

164
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,493
You baked today.
l can smell fresh bread on you.

165
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,372
Sometime today
you cooked with salt pork.

166
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,624
Smell that on you, too.

167
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,627
You smell all over like soap.

168
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,673
You took a bath. And on top of that,
you smell all over like a woman.

169
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,220
l could find you in the dark, Mrs. Lowe,
and I’m only part Indian.

170
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:16,558
Mrs. Lowe.

171
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,393
What do you want?

172
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,397
-l watered and grained the stock.
-Thank you.

173
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,567
I’ll bed down near here
someplace tonight.

174
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,363
Mr. Lane?

175
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,579
You can't sleep outside,
there's a storm coming.

176
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,165
I’ve fixed a pallet for you in the corner.

177
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,676
It would be uncivilized
to let anyone sleep outside,

178
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,261
and after all, we are civilized, aren't we?

179
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,931
Speaking for you, of course. But me?

180
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,934
l guess you could call me civilized.

181
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,607
That's your bed.
I’m sorry it has to be on the floor.

182
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:12,280
l have to set the batter for the morning.
l hope the noise won't disturb you.

183
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,907
It won't.

184
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,453
Good night, ma'am.

185
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,394
Put that gun down.

186
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,567
You're Hondo Lane, the gunman.

187
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,320
-l carry a gun.
-Don't come any nearer.

188
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,323
You killed three men
in a gunfight last year.

189
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,909
-We heard about it. Three men.
-Yes, ma'am.

190
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,829
-Just as quick as l could.
-Don't come any nearer.

191
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,168
It’s not a very good idea
to point one of these things at anybody

192
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,795
with an empty chamber
under the firing pin.

193
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,922
You can see it plain as day.

194
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,842
l keep it that way because of Johnny.

195
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,927
Well, now it's loaded.

196
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,139
Keep it that way, and keep it high.

197
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,862
Please stay. l really want you to.

198
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,326
I’m sorry. l should have realized from
the beginning that you are a gentleman.

199
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,043
Civilized? Gentleman?

200
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,963
Well, a lot for one day.

201
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,304
Night, ma'am.

202
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,743
Morning. Getting an early start.

203
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,831
Be sure and tell that little man
goodbye for me.

204
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,375
l ought to wake him
to say goodbye to you.

205
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,502
Was it me, l'd let him sleep.

206
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,089
Youngsters grow sleeping,
but you do what you want to.

207
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,801
He was so delighted with that whistle
you made for him.

208
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,930
Glad to hear it.
He and l got along just fine.

209
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,268
It’s more like a flute than a whistle.
It ranges almost the full scale.

210
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,771
l learned to make them when l was
living with the Mescalero.

211
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,858
My squaw used to make them
for every kid in the lodge.

212
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,112
-You lived with the Apache?
-Five years.

213
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,074
-And you had an Indian wife?
-Wife, squaw...

214
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,996
l took the liberty of borrowing a few feet
of rope off of that coil in the lean-to.

215
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,749
-Gladly pay you for it, if you let me.
-'Course not.

216
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,586
The hills are so beautiful today.

217
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,964
Odd how clear they always are
after a dust storm.

218
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,304
Must have been very interesting
living with the Apache.

219
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:23,930
l liked it.

220
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:29,477
-This Indian wife you have...
-Had. She's dead.

221
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,939
I’m sorry. l didn't mean to bring up
an unhappy memory.

222
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:40,405
l can't remember anything unhappy
about Destarte.

223
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:45,327
Destarte? How musical.
What does it mean?

224
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,499
You can't say it except in Mescalero.
It means morning.

225
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,045
But that isn't what it means, either.

226
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,633
Means more than just that.
Indian words mean the sound and

227
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,801
feel of a word, like,

228
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,513
crack of dawn, the first bronze light

229
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,184
that makes the buttes stand out
against the gray desert.

230
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,312
The first sound you hear of a brook

231
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,106
curling over some rocks,
with trout jumping.

232
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,319
It’s like when you get
up in the first light,

233
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,366
just you and her and you go out of
a wickiup.

234
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,412
Where it smells kind of smoky
and private, just you and her, and

235
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,707
kind of safe with just the two of you.

236
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,377
Stand outside and

237
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,506
feel the bite of the first wind
coming down from the high divide

238
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,175
that promises snowfall.

239
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,973
Can't say it in English,
but that was her name.

240
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,517
Destarte.

241
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:57,023
-You remind me of her some.
-Of an Indian girl?

242
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,025
Was she fair?

243
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,653
Her hair was black as 1 0 feet down.

244
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,490
Did you ever see a crow's wing,
how black and gleaming it is?

245
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,784
-Yes.
-That's the way her hair shined.

246
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,704
l'd like to pay you for that rope.

247
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,832
Riding dispatch,
l have the right to give U.S. script.

248
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:18,044
-You loved her?
-l don't know.

249
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,714
l needed her.

250
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:28,888
-But if she was dark and I’m fair...
-Why you reminded me of her?

251
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,391
-Yes.
-l don't know.

252
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,853
l thought about it.
You don't look anything like her.

253
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,481
l am fully aware
that l am a homely woman, Mr. Lane.

254
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,066
l didn't mean that.

255
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,570
l have a bad habit of telling the truth.
But being pretty isn't much.

256
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,697
l know a lot of pretty people
l wouldn't trust

257
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,907
with a busted nickel-plated watch.

258
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,453
But some others, something comes
out of the inside of them and

259
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,663
you know you can trust them.

260
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,957
Destarte had that.

261
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,085
And you've got it, too.

262
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,760
-I’m a married woman.
-l thought about that, too.

263
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,138
l guess l kissed you
because you remind me of Destarte.

264
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,432
Or maybe it was because
l hate to think of your hair

265
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,351
hanging from the center pole
of an Apache wickiup.

266
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,646
Well, a long time ago l made me a rule.

267
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,941
l let people do what they want to do.

268
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,404
Sam!

269
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,205
You are a strange man, Mr. Lane.

270
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,375
l don't know about that.
Goodbye, Mrs. Lowe.

271
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,868
-You are Vittorio.
-l am Vittorio.

272
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,204
Your horses have been watered here.

273
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,708
-You were told to go.
-l couldn't leave.

274
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:05,253
My husband is away,
and l didn't think that l...

275
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,385
Your people water their horses here.

276
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,433
You leave my mother alone.

277
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,263
Stop him! Stop him!

278
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,822
-l ain't scared of you.
-You're not fear Apache?

279
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,285
No.

280
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,456
He fear hurt to mother,
but not death to self.

281
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,961
He brave. Like Apache boy.

282
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,514
Him now blood brother.
l call him Small Warrior.

283
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,267
Him belong Moon Dog Lodge,
Chiricahua Apache.

284
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:46,312
You care for him well.
You now mother Chiricahua warrior.

285
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,022
Live safely here.

286
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,861
l hope someday,
someone befriends your sons.

287
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:57,323
My sons are dead. White man kill them.

288
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,755
Figured your scalp would be hanging
in some Apache wickiup by now.

289
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,633
-Hi, Buffalo.
-Been making bets on it.

290
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,593
You're sure a disappointment to me,
Hondo.

291
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,595
You like to win your bet.

292
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,514
l wore out some horses.

293
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,725
You wore out you while you was at it.
Here, let me get that.

294
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,728
Where's that water?

295
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,110
-Looks like l won a bet, Buffalo.
-Hi, Dick.

296
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,404
Yeah, l owe you a jug of red-eye.

297
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:04,117
-This feels good.
-There's times when water is good.

298
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,332
That's exactly what l mean.

299
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,793
l say l got a right to talk to
this here bow-necked Major,

300
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,295
-l don't talk to no underlings.
-Major's asleep.

301
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,215
That's just too bad about him.
I’m a citizen and l want to see him.

302
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,426
Major ain't had any sleep for three days.

303
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,761
l can tell you everything
just as well as he can.

304
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,305
We ain't heard nothing from up north.

305
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,309
lf you ask me, the Cavalry's scared of
Vittorio. l think the U.S. Cavalry...

306
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:34,021
l am greatly interested in your opinion of
the United States Cavalry.

307
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,399
Continue, Mr... Whatever your name is.

308
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,943
The Cavalry is supposed to support
the settlers.

309
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,778
I’ve got some cattle up north,
l don't intend...

310
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:45,199
C troop is making a sweep to the north
to escort out any settlers they may find.

311
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:49,620
C troop is now over a week late
in returning. That's all l can tell you.

312
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,789
C troop isn't coming back.

313
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,550
l'd be obliged, sir, if you would leave.

314
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,177
A fine business, the whole territory...

315
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,678
-Sergeant!
-Get!

316
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,479
Get out of the way, you mangy...

317
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,692
lf that's your cur, get him out of the way.

318
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,152
Walk around him.

319
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,614
I’ll be hanged if l go out of my way
for any cur dog.

320
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,658
A man ought to do
what he thinks is best.

321
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,757
Quit blocking the door.

322
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,471
Where did you get this?

323
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,766
-Half a day's ride south of Twin Buttes.
-How?

324
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,435
Took it off a couple of Indians, Apaches.

325
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,896
Running Dog Lodge of the Mescaleros.

326
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,274
Mescaleros are up, too.
That makes all the Apache lodges.

327
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,196
Say, while l was south, did any settlers
get in from the north basin?

328
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,697
A few, the last couple of weeks.

329
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,784
Handsome woman, fair,
with a boy about six?

330
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,328
No, mostly middle-aged
or elderly people.

331
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,081
Get some sleep, Lane, use my tent.

332
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,457
Thank you.

333
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,886
While you're sleeping,
I’ll move your possibles over to my tent.

334
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,099
Pete Britton was scouting with C troop.

335
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,437
Wintered with old Pete once
up on the Divide. Ornery cuss.

336
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,566
Them Indians you took
that pennant offen.

337
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,609
-Dead Indians?
-Finally.

338
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,626
-Hi, Pete.
-Hi, Hondo.

339
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,878
Broke my heart
when l heard you made it.

340
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,132
Your pap know you started out
against this so-called whiskey?

341
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,592
l ain't seen him for a month.

342
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,885
l know you haven't. Come here,
l got a message for you.

343
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,513
Leave him be, Hondo,
l can't make no money scouting.

344
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,141
Aw, these other fellows'll excuse you.
Come on over at the bar.

345
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:19,061
l won't. I'm out almost $100.

346
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,732
-That figures, with Buffalo in the game.
-Wait a minute.

347
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,651
These shirts are hard to come by.

348
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,618
-What'd you hit me for?
-'Cause l know you.

349
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:34,910
Leather it.

350
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,248
No, don't leather it.

351
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,885
No wonder them Apaches
call him Emberato.

352
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,928
-What does it mean?
-Bad temper.

353
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,686
l should've let him shoot you.

354
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,565
That's the second time I’ve tangled with
that mouthy no-good...

355
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,527
-What's his name?
-Calls himself Lowe, Ed Lowe.

356
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,206
Johnny.

357
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:36,681
Johnny!

358
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,936
Mommy.

359
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,527
Hi, Mommy.
Vittorio says I’ll make a good Apache.

360
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,864
l thought... l didn't know he was
with you, l didn't hear anything.

361
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,909
-Apache no make noise.
-Look what he gave me.

362
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,371
-It is lodge token. His.
-It’s very pretty, thank you.

363
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,456
He will ride well.

364
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,959
And he no afraid.

365
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,130
-l speak with your mother, go to house.
-Yes, Vittorio.

366
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,218
Lodge should have man.

367
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:18,514
-My husband will be home any day now.
-l no think so.

368
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,516
l think he dead.

369
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,692
Small Warrior should have father.

370
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,333
See, Sergeant, just like l told you.

371
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,087
That's my horse, all right.
Got my brand on it. "E.L." Ed Lowe.

372
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,714
What he says true?

373
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,425
-Yeah, that's his horse.
-Where'd you get him?

374
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,720
From his ranch,
that's where I’m taking him back.

375
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,930
That's where he can pick him up.

376
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,267
But that's Indian territory, strict orders
against any Whites going in there.

377
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,521
You know something, Joe, l got a bad
ear. l can't hear a thing you're saying.

378
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,115
Aren't you gonna prefer charges
against him?

379
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,785
He may be a mean, ornery,
son-of-anything-you-wanna-call-him,

380
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,453
but he ain't no horse thief.

381
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,706
And I’m not gonna call him one,
to his face or his back.

382
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,222
You stay here.

383
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,405
l thought the Apache were always silent.

384
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,243
Not when they seek squaw.
You pick one.

385
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,744
What?

386
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,663
It’s not good for Small Warrior

387
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,582
to be without father
to teach him how to be man.

388
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,837
This is the one l was calling Emiliano.

389
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,756
Very brave, has taken many scalps.

390
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:20,928
He has six horses, and two squaws,
but one old and will soon die.

391
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,516
He's good hunter.

392
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,601
Never hungry, his wickiup.

393
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,814
This is one who is called Kloori.

394
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,694
He has ten horses, one squaw.

395
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,365
Sachito, brave warrior, many horses.

396
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,787
Not much beat squaws, sings very loud.

397
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:59,300
-Boy, go stand by my horse.
-Yes, Vittorio.

398
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:06,140
Small Warrior never to see tears,
Apache does not weep.

399
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,560
Chief, you can't make me do this,
I’m married.

400
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,979
You are fool, your man dead.

401
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:16,066
Soon come planting rain.
lf your man come home by then, good.

402
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,402
lf not, you take Apache brave.

403
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,496
Remember, time of planting rain.

404
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,801
He's getting kind of deep
into Indian territory.

405
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,178
And so are we.

406
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,723
What are you squawking for?
You're getting well paid.

407
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,476
He'll be making camp pretty soon.

408
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,520
Don't get a chance at him then,
we'll turn back.

409
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,264
Quiet, Sam, l hear them.

410
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,444
Come on, Sam.

411
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,077
That's his camp, all right.

412
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,841
Rifle's gone,
must be out looking for camp meat.

413
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,677
-You're all right, you're not hurt bad.
-This tintype saved me.

414
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,645
That did it.

415
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,483
Now, every Apache between us
and the ranch will be alerted.

416
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,319
They'll have us cut off.

417
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,489
No, there's nobody between us
and Fort Seddon.

418
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,000
Beat it, Sam!

419
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,677
-White man understand Apache.
-A little.

420
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,013
He know now how he die.

421
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,682
Your coup stick shows many scalps.

422
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:49,061
Yes, many. Soon, you.

423
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,687
Man's scalp would look
out of place there.

424
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:54,066
You took all yours from squaws,
papoose, and dogs.

425
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,279
Your lodge should be real proud of you.

426
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,957
You will take long time die.

427
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,730
Where are soldiers, White man?

428
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,233
-How many?
-l don't know, Vittorio.

429
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,734
You know my name?

430
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,071
l saw you once at the Treaty Council
at Fort Meade.

431
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,280
The treaty.

432
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,835
The treaty was like rustle of wind
to White man.

433
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,840
-Now you tell, where are soldiers?
-This, l do not know.

434
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,093
-Hat. Soldier hat.
-l was once a soldier.

435
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,303
Why you here Apache land?

436
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,931
This is for me to know.

437
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,634
I’m told you speak insults
to this one of my chiefs.

438
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,807
The cougar screams insults
and is brave.

439
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,312
A coyote howls insults and is a coward.

440
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,189
We shall see.

441
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,317
Cougar or coyote.

442
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,361
You will die bravely in silence,

443
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,823
or you will wail
like woman bringing forth child

444
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:10,035
and cry out to us
where pony-soldiers are.

445
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,213
He claims the blood right,
you understand?

446
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,216
You mean, he says l shot his brother?

447
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,553
l understand.

448
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,752
So that life may ebb cleanly.

449
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:53,490
Forget your blood right
or join your brother.

450
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,554
You think you buy your life now?

451
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,765
l don't think.

452
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,893
You may live or die, we see.

453
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,196
Indians.

454
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,889
Is this your man?

455
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,892
Speak, is this your man?

456
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,729
-Yes, this is my husband.
-White man,

457
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,067
you lived with the Apache, that's good.

458
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,653
You know how Small Warrior
should be taught that,

459
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:58,948
he be honored son of wickiup
of one who's called Vittorio.

460
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:02,410
Watch like the hawk,
be patient as the beaver,

461
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,205
brave as puma, that he may learn well.

462
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:06,915
Know it, then,

463
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:10,668
or your dying will be long before
you welcome death.

464
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,620
-More coffee?
-No, thanks.

465
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,294
-What are you gonna do?
-Gonna fix up your shirt.

466
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,130
Not before l show you something.

467
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,765
-Did Ed give you this?
-l took it off his body.

468
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,143
He's dead.

469
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,522
Tried to tell you before.

470
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,443
Funny, I’m not surprised.

471
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:03,114
Perhaps because l knew all along,
just wouldn't admit it to myself.

472
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,742
-Hi, Emberato, you didn't die, did you?
-Hello, Johnny.

473
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,076
Be careful.

474
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,746
l wanna show you something,
Emberato. My Indian emblem.

475
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,165
Vittorio gave it to me, didn't he, Mom?

476
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:19,714
-He's taken a great liking to Johnny.
-Probably saved your life and mine.

477
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,800
Indians place great value
on male children.

478
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,179
They also place a great value
on dying well.

479
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:29,390
Did Ed die well?

480
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,060
l keep it under my pillow.

481
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,896
He died well.

482
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,692
When Johnny's old enough,
when he has to be told,

483
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,487
it will make him proud.

484
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,866
Here it is, Emberato. I’m a chief now.
Isn't it wonderful?

485
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,248
-Isn’t it?
-Yes, Johnny.

486
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,620
-Where's your mother?
-Picking watercress.

487
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,331
-Any luck?
-Not a bite this morning.

488
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,167
See where the sun is?

489
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,004
-Up there.
-Yeah, on the back of your neck.

490
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,672
You're casting a shadow.

491
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,008
lf you can see it, the fish can see it.

492
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,636
Always fish with the sun in your face.
The other bank's the place.

493
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,640
-That is, if you want my opinion.
-Gosh, Emberato, l want your opinion.

494
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,517
But Mama won't let me go over there.

495
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,602
-Why not?
-l can't swim.

496
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,814
-You can't what?
-l can't swim.

497
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,816
-How old are you?
-Six.

498
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,413
Help him, he can't swim.

499
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,957
Time he learned.
Everybody should swim.

500
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,879
Just reach out in front of you
and grab a handful of water.

501
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,630
Pull it back towards you.

502
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,886
Not too fast. That's the way l learned.

503
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:38,186
-l did it, Emberato, l did it.
-Good.

504
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,980
-How will he get back?
-Swim.

505
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,690
Well, he might drown.

506
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,985
-Well, then, you go get him.
-l can't swim, either.

507
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,317
Angie, there's

508
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,405
something I’ve got to tell you.
l tried to tell you.

509
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:16,159
-And it isn't going to be easy.
-Then don't say it yet.

510
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,161
Just look at the moon.

511
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,123
How odd it looks in this quarter.

512
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,587
When l was a child, my mother
used to tell me it was a teeter-totter.

513
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,175
You know,
the tilted plank a child plays on.

514
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,595
l suppose the Indians have a word for it.

515
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,764
Yeah, bermarga. It’s the planting moon.

516
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,684
Indians won't plant their corn
unless the moon's like that.

517
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,437
You liked living with the Apache,
didn't you?

518
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,273
Angie, I’ve just got to tell you this.

519
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,483
I’m not much for lying.

520
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,111
The last time l was here,
before Vittorio brought me?

521
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,321
Yes.

522
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:57,116
l rode dispatch some after that,
then came to Seddon.

523
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,202
There was trouble.

524
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,370
l killed a man.

525
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:08,044
Stay still. Somebody in those willows.

526
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,797
Don't shoot, White man.

527
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,392
Small Warrior has knife.
He sleeps with it.

528
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,728
-You were in the house?
-In house.

529
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:30,358
Wickiup empty place without sons.
Mine empty wickiup.

530
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,946
You better tell that brave back at
the creek bank not to walk in the water.

531
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,323
l almost killed him a few minutes ago.

532
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,331
Almost threw a shot at him.

533
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,833
He very young. Will learn.

534
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,711
-lf he lives.
-You are Apache.

535
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,715
Now, hear me, pony-soldiers are near.

536
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:59,262
Soon will be fought remembered fight.
They will come here first.

537
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:03,391
-You will not go with them, White man.
-l will not.

538
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:06,227
Leader of pony-soldiers
will question you.

539
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,981
You will say you have seen Apache
trailing to the west.

540
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,775
This l won't do.

541
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,779
-You will not?
-l will not.

542
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,617
You have good man, treasure him.

543
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:32,336
They're mounting up now
down by the butte.

544
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:34,255
l don't hear a thing.

545
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,299
There's eight of them l'd say,
or maybe nine.

546
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,717
There's something in those trees.

547
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,594
That's a squirrel.
Our talking woke him up.

548
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,431
He's put out. There's nine of them.

549
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:45,641
l love you.

550
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,438
l suppose l shouldn't have said that,

551
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,606
with my husband dead so short a time.

552
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:57,153
l don't guess people's hearts
got anything to do with a calendar.

553
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,958
You were so wonderful,
refusing to lie for Vittorio.

554
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,337
He was testing me. Indians hate lies.

555
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,132
And l guess l got to feel the same way,

556
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,218
but, once in a while a fella's got to

557
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:24,013
lie if it'll make it easier
on someone else.

558
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,663
Troop, halt!

559
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,377
Prepare to dismount.

560
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,712
Dismount!

561
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:12,311
Madam and sir, may l present myself?
Lt. McKay, Troop D, 8th cavalry.

562
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,439
-Hi, Hondo, you old cabin robber.
-Hi, Buff.

563
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,691
Lieutenant, this here is Hondo Lane.

564
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:21,070
He's scouted some and ridden dispatch
some for the cavalry.

565
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:24,907
-l don't reckon l know this here lady.
-This is Ms. Lowe, Lieutenant.

566
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,034
You people are lucky.
Obviously, Vittorio

567
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,912
and his renegade band just happened
not to find this hidden valley.

568
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,331
-Vittorio's been here lots.
-And you lived?

569
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,125
One lone man stood off Vittorio?

570
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:37,420
No lone man stands off the Apache.
He lets us live here.

571
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:40,506
There are almost 1 00 dead settlers
in the basin,

572
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,591
scalped by this cowardly criminal.

573
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,678
Vittorio may be a criminal by the books,
l don't know.

574
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,264
But if he's a coward,
it hasn't showed up yet.

575
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,474
-Amen, brother.
-l must disagree with you, Mr. Lane.

576
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,476
He's run before us for 200 miles.

577
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,396
Indians have a story
they tell their young ones

578
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:59,275
about a hunter who chased a wild cat
until he caught it.

579
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,776
Then it was the other way around.

580
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:03,112
The story goes back further than
the Indians.

581
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,740
It’s originally attributed
to the first Roman army to enter Tartary.

582
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,451
The soldier caught a Tartar
and yelled out.

583
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,953
The officer called back
for him to come in with his prisoner.

584
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,539
And he replied,
"The Tartar won't let me."

585
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,292
That was one of the favorite stories
of Col Mays,

586
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,085
who teaches cavalry tactics at the Point.

587
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,628
The story is world-wide.

588
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,006
How long have you been
out of that school, Lieutenant?

589
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,799
Graduated class '69, sir.

590
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,551
This is '70, ain't it?

591
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,386
l just can't seem to keep up
with the years.

592
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,805
l meant to get a calendar,
but then l forget.

593
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,724
Say, who's President
of these United States now?

594
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,933
Ulysses S. Grant.

595
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:36,187
You know, l voted once. l was down
in Independence around voting time.

596
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:38,189
And a fellow come up to me
and offered me $2

597
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,982
if l'd vote for a man named Taylor.

598
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,567
And l was drinking,

599
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,695
drinking a little at the time. And l...
The $2 didn't last...

600
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,115
Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Lane, my orders are
to make a sweep as far as Twin Buttes.

601
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,160
My men'll bivouac here tonight.
We'll go on to Twin Buttes tomorrow,

602
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,787
return tomorrow night to escort you
and your boy out to safety.

603
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:57,833
lf you'll excuse me, madam, l must see
that my men are properly encamped.

604
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,256
Very nice and very young.

605
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,717
He for doggone sure is, ma'am.

606
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:10,137
-How long you been out on this patrol?
-This is the 20th day.

607
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:13,557
We've rounded up about eight families
back there, that's all there are left.

608
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:15,976
We're gonna pick them up
on the way out.

609
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,895
There've been many a scalp took,
Hondo.

610
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,481
-You know where Vittorio is, don't you?
-l do.

611
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,191
This boy Lieutenant's
gonna get you killed.

612
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,902
Us scouts has got to get
these young officers educated.

613
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,488
Johnny, go in
and set out the plates for me.

614
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,782
Hondo, if your friend
would like to eat with us, Mr...

615
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,034
Buffalo? Mr...

616
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:35,246
I’ve known you for 8 or 1 0 years.
You must have a last name.

617
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,082
Well, of course l got a last name,
what do you think l am?

618
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,709
l know what you are,
but there's a lady present.

619
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:43,963
Mrs. Lowe, my name is Baker.
That's what it is, Buffalo Baker.

620
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,924
Well, you may eat with us then,
Mr. Baker, and wash.

621
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:50,427
There's a basin on the bench
and a towel on the jug, and soap.

622
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,181
You know, there is something
about this place...

623
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:56,392
-l know what it reminds me of.
-My ranch.

624
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:57,726
In California.

625
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,854
l shot a deer right off your front porch
on a butte just like that.

626
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,607
With a crick down below
and the mesas all spreading out.

627
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,234
Made me pack it back.

628
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,531
-You have a place that looks like this?
-East of San Dimas.

629
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:12,449
How wonderful.

630
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,623
You're getting to where you kind of
take to that water.

631
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,208
Every time l wash my face

632
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:24,753
l think of you and that night at Seddon's,
when you whacked me.

633
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:28,257
You busted off a jaw tooth, and it got to
hurting so bad l had to go to

634
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,301
the barber and have him dig out
the rest of it.

635
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:33,178
Did l catch you that day,
l'd have set your sun.

636
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,681
That's the last morning you'd ever seen.

637
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,642
"Hondo Lane, first prize,
Winchester Arms."

638
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:43,230
Always liked this rifle of yours. Always
wanted one of the new issue myself.

639
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,149
Keep your hands off it.

640
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,736
I’ve known him 1 0 years, and he's never
spoken a friendly word to me.

641
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,155
-l don't like you.
-Figured that.

642
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,867
But now l figure is how he might admire
to give me that rifle.

643
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:58,829
You see, about a half day out
of Seddon, l come across some bodies.

644
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,332
One of them
was this here lady's husband.

645
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,501
There was a lot of horse tracks
around there.

646
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:07,046
Some of them belonged
to that there chestnut you were riding.

647
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,423
That one with the cast-off horseshoe.

648
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:13,344
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice
little set-up you got yourself here.

649
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,804
Nice ranch. Pretty woman.

650
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,140
You could get yourself killed
talking like this.

651
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,851
Or l could get that
new-fashioned Winchester

652
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,354
since he bushwhacked
this lady's husband.

653
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,814
Did she know that,
l figure she wouldn't look at him like

654
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:29,485
he was the high cockalorum
of every tribe from here to Salt Water.

655
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:31,987
Hondo.

656
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,589
l tried to tell you.

657
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,886
Mrs. Lowe, we're ready to leave.

658
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,554
Mr. Lane?

659
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,640
-Stridon.
-Yes, sir.

660
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,351
-Form the troops, column of twos.
-Yes, sir.

661
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,979
l want you to accompany us
as far as Twin Buttes.

662
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,607
Haven't any time to lose,
so l'd be obliged if you'd saddle up.

663
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,567
-I’m not going.
-You're not going?

664
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:12,236
-That's right.
-But why?

665
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,904
-Gave my word.
-Your word to whom?

666
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,989
-Vittorio.
-Surely a word given to an

667
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:19,576
-Indian desperado wouldn't be...
-Mister, when l give my word, l keep it.

668
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,245
Now I’ll give you a piece of advice,

669
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,914
there's only one family
between here and Twin Buttes,

670
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,041
and you're too late to do them any good.

671
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:30,087
So you better gather up what settlers
you have and hightail it out of here.

672
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:33,340
Sir, l have my orders,
and these orders will be executed.

673
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:34,842
Ma'am.

674
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,055
Prepare to mount.

675
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:42,933
Mount.

676
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,478
Forward,

677
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:47,688
ho!

678
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,827
-Angie.
-l can't talk now. l have to think.

679
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,371
I’ll put your things outside.

680
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,727
-Before l go l want to explain something.
-Yes?

681
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,064
It didn't happen
in the low way you heard it.

682
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,901
-l didn't bushwhack.
-l never for a moment thought you did.

683
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,321
-But you killed him.
-l didn't have any choice,

684
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,990
-he cut loose at me...
-l should have known that.

685
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:25,577
l should have known you were lying
to make me think well of him.

686
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:29,414
Poor Ed. l guess he wasn't the sort
of man to die well.

687
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,625
Sorry now l hated him so much.

688
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,753
l guess he couldn't help
being weak and selfish.

689
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,756
-l just didn't have any choice.
-l know that.

690
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:44,513
You're gonna feel differently about me?

691
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:47,933
No one has any control
over the way they feel.

692
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,687
I’m never going to change
the way l feel about you.

693
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,106
But,

694
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,233
what about him?

695
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,115
Yeah.

696
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,452
Guess there are some things
that just can't...

697
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,415
He's gonna be a good man.

698
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:16,587
Good spread to his shoulders.
Head works, too.

699
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:22,634
Other night, after you went to sleep,
he crawled up into my bunk

700
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,470
and put his arms around my neck.

701
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,473
Made me feel kind of funny.

702
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,143
Like he was depending on me.

703
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,605
Lot of things l'd rather do than this.

704
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,481
You're going to tell him?

705
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:41,153
lf l don't, somebody else will.
And l got a belly full of lies.

706
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,411
Look what l got!

707
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,998
-Hold him by the gills like l showed you.
-Sure.

708
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,753
-Johnny, l want to tell you something.
-It’s a nice perch, ain't it?

709
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,047
Bass. Remember the shape of its head?

710
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:03,425
Oh yeah, l forgot.
Bass have a jaw that stick out like this.

711
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,595
What l wanted to tell you is,

712
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,014
while back,
a man came at me with a gun.

713
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,475
-l had to kill him.
-Good. Indian?

714
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:15,312
No, he was a white man, Johnny,
but l didn't have any choice. He...

715
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:20,609
l told you to press down on the shank,
and then you won't stick yourself.

716
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,569
Won't break the hook, either.

717
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,740
Here, bite down on this stick.
That's the way Indian youngsters

718
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,700
learn not to cry.

719
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,794
-Johnny, this man l killed...
-No!

720
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:45,676
Your ranch in California,
it's far, too far for gossip to travel.

721
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,554
Go wrap your thumb
in some bayberry leaves.

722
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,558
You and your silly ideals.

723
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:56,728
You think truth
is the most important thing.

724
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,106
-It’s the measure of a man.
-Not for a woman.

725
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:02,526
A man can afford to have
noble sentiments and poses.

726
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,904
But a woman only has the man
she marries. That's her truth.

727
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,448
And if he's no good,
that's still her truth.

728
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,576
l married a man who was a liar,
a thief, and a coward.

729
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,745
He was a drunkard and unfaithful.

730
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,288
He only married me to get this ranch,

731
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,499
and then he deserted Johnny
and me for good.

732
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,918
And that's your fine truth for you.

733
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,755
-Could l bring Johnny up on that?
-No, l guess you couldn't.

734
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,091
And then you come along
and you're good and fine,

735
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,677
and everything that Ed
could never hope to be.

736
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:32,889
And now, with your vanity, you want to
spoil Johnny's chances, and mine?

737
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,566
-Varlebena.
-What?

738
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,194
When the Indians wind up their
squaw-seeking ceremony,

739
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:49,281
they only say one word. Varlebena.

740
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,283
It means forever.

741
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:57,831
Forever.

742
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:25,817
Well, we caught the wild cat.
Give us a hand, will you?

743
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,909
l can't understand,
we killed him on the last charge.

744
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,035
Vittorio?

745
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,286
They had us surrounded.

746
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,038
Could've cut us to pieces,
then they withdrew.

747
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,540
That's why they pulled out.
Anytime their leader is killed,

748
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,209
that means their medicine's bad.

749
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,628
-This poor child.
-We're going out with this troop.

750
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,379
-Vittorio's dead.
-No, he can't be.

751
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,091
Everybody gets dead, it was his turn.
Now get your possibles.

752
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,258
l have some medicine in the cabin.

753
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,468
Thank you, Mrs. Lowe, l'd be

754
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,720
eternally grateful
if you'd pass among the men first.

755
01:13:53,805 --> 01:13:55,388
No, you're wounded,
I’m going to fix you up.

756
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:58,058
Thank you, ma'am.
The men are in worse shape than l am.

757
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,852
Come on, do as he says.
We'll take care of him.

758
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,189
-Sergeant.
-Yes, sir?

759
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:05,690
Dismount the men.

760
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,276
-Hitch their horses up to the wagon.
-Yes, sir.

761
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,362
You'll find harness in the barn.

762
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:13,698
Len.

763
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,328
-What do you want?
-Take four men and gather the settlers.

764
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,289
We'll probably catch up with you
at Errad Crossing.

765
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:25,085
Wilson, McGrath, Lyon, Johnson.

766
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,589
-How is he?
-He'll make out.

767
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,925
Don't know much.
Led us into an ambush.

768
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:35,929
But l ain't ashamed of him nohow.
Bullet holes are in the front of him.

769
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,265
All those youngsters from the Point
are like that.

770
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,724
They got to learn.

771
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,060
Partly they learn, partly they die.

772
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,146
But l gotta float my stick same as you.

773
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,898
l never saw one of them
l had to be ashamed of.

774
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,598
Join in and keep moving.

775
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,102
Move it along, there!

776
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:25,770
Hurry up!

777
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,280
Come on, move along here!

778
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,055
Come on, hurry it up.

779
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,139
Hurry it up!

780
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,987
Circle the wagons!

781
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:21,201
Wheel her around.

782
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,162
Circle the wagons!

783
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,498
Hold on!

784
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,694
Stay in the wagon.
Keep everybody in the wagons.

785
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,195
And don't unhitch.

786
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:27,726
Hondo!

787
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,186
All this circle's doing
is protect the horses.

788
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:31,563
We gotta turn some wagons over.

789
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,149
And stay here? That's what they expect.

790
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:35,692
We gotta do what they don't expect.

791
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,486
That's why all the heavy artillery's
in Buffalo's wagon.

792
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,071
Buffalo!

793
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:46,202
Lieutenant, get down.
Are you ready, Buff?

794
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,830
-l was born ready.
-Let's go.

795
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:57,148
Circle the wagons.

796
01:18:57,817 --> 01:18:59,150
Close up.

797
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,363
Stay down!

798
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:46,781
Sergeant!

799
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:13,057
-l don't want to be an Apache, Mama.
-Now, you be quiet.

800
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,269
We're going to get out all right.
Now, help me, hurry.

801
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:30,200
-Ready again, Buff?
-As l told you, l was born ready.

802
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:09,906
Throw me your knife.

803
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,335
Get out of here!

804
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,404
All right, Hondo!

805
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,199
They're not following.

806
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,702
Leader's dead.
They'll powwow and pick a new one.

807
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,329
We're out of trouble
if we get a move on.

808
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:41,623
And am l going to get to drive?

809
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:45,209
Before we get to San Dimas,
you'll be a top teamster, son.

810
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,174
-How are you, Lieutenant?
-Fine, thanks to you.

811
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:55,386
And you're all right, thanks to Lennie.
He shot that Indian offen your back.

812
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:57,263
-Thanks.
-With your rifle.

813
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:58,890
It’s his.

814
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:02,060
Don't look like we'll be needing it
much more today.

815
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:08,316
General Crook will be here
within a month with a large force.

816
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,736
-That'll be the end of the Apache.
-Yeah.

817
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,405
End of a way of life.

818
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,450
Too bad, it's a good way.

819
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,994
Wagons forward!
