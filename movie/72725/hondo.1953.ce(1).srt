He would have enjoyed having a man to talk to.

We welcome visitors.

�ҿ������㲻�������õ���ʳ��ϰ�ߴӱ��ˡ�
I see. You don't want him to get in the habit of taking food from anyone else.

I won't give you an argument there.

He's always been a fighter.

I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for a horse that wouldn't fight.

It lets you down when the going gets tough.

His horse had 40 scalps hung in its mane.

That was before the treaty.

We broke that treaty, us Whites.

00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:26,932

There's no word in the Apache language for lie, and they've been lied to.

��Ȼ,�ܶ๷�ŵ�ӡ�ڰ��ˡ�����Խ����ǡ�
Sure, lots of dogs smell Indians. You can teach them.

149
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,687

Beat a puppy. How cruel.

That's the way they do it.

And that's your fine truth for you.

723
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,038
- ���ܰ�Լ��������? - ��,�Ҳ��㲻�ܡ�
- Could I bring Johnny up on that? - No, I guess you couldn't.

724
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:26,337
Ȼ�����������ܺ�,�ܺá�����
And then you come along and you're good and fine...

725
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:28,911
��һ�в�����ϣ�����¡�
and everything that Ed could never hope to be.

726
01:12:29,046 --> 01:12:33,005
����,���������,�����ƻ�Լ����Ļ���,���ҵ���?
And now, with your vanity, you want to spoil Johnny's chances, and mine?

727
01:12:39,723 --> 01:12:42,818
Varlebena�� -ʲô?
<i>- Varlebena.</i> - What?

728
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:46,458
��ӡ���˾������ǵ�Ů��Ѱ����ʽ����
When the Indians wind up their squaw-seeking ceremony...

729
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:49,556
����ֻ˵һ����: Varlebena��
they only say one word: <i>Varlebena.</i>

730
01:12:50,067 --> 01:12:51,557
����ζ����Զ��
It means forever.

731
01:12:56,874 --> 01:12:57,840
��Զ�ġ�
Forever.

732
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:26,093
��,����ץס��Ұè��������һ��,������?
Well, we caught the wild cat. Give us a hand, will you?

733
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:34,169
�Ҳ�������,����ɱ���������һ����ɡ�
I can't understand, we killed him on the last charge.

734
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:35,266
ά������?
Vittorio?

735
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,568
���ǰ����ǰ�Χ��
They had us surrounded.

736
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:38,307
���԰����ǵ���Ƭ,Ȼ�����ǳ����ˡ�
Could've cut us to pieces, then they withdrew.

737
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:40,815
�����Ϊʲô�����˳����κ�ʱ�����ǵ����䱻ɱ����
That's why they pulled out. Anytime their leader is killed...

738
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,475
����ζ�����ǵ�ҽѧ�Ļ���
that means their medicine's bad.

739
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:44,918

01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:46,648

741
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,384

Everybody gets dead, it was his turn. Now get your possibles.

742
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:50,720
����һЩҩ�ڻ����ڡ�
I have some medicine in the cabin.

Thank you, Mrs. Lowe, I'd be...

eternally grateful if you'd pass among the men first.

745
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,655

No, you're wounded, I'm going to fix you up.

746
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,325
лл��,���ˡ�������˱�����������ľ��ء�
Thank you, ma'am. The men are in worse shape than I am.

747
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,131
��,����˵���������ǻ��չ˺����ġ�
Come on, do as he says. We'll take care of him.

- Sergeant. - Yes, sir?

749
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:06,006

Dismount the men.

750
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:08,576
- ������������-�ǵ�,������
- Hitch their horses up to the wagon. - Yes, sir.

751
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,668
��ᷢ�ֵ����������档
You'll find harness in the barn.

01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:14,008

753
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:18,646

754
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,519
���ǿ��ܻ������Errad��Խ��
We'll probably catch up with you at Errad Crossing.

755
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:25,394
����ѷ,�����˼,�ﰺ,Լ��ѷ��
Wilson, McGrath, Lyon, Johnson.

756
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,890

- How is he? - He'll make out.

757
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,195

Don't know much. Led us into an ambush.

758
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:36,238
���Ҳ�����һ��Ҳ���е�������������������ǰ��
But I ain't ashamed of him nohow. Bullet holes are in the front of him.

759
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:38,534
������Щ���˴ӵ����������
All those youngsters from the Point are like that.

760
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:40,007
���Ǳ���ѧϰ��
They got to learn.

761
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,303
����ѧϰ�Ĳ���,����ԭ������������
Partly they learn, partly they die.

762
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:44,411
�����ҵø��Ҽ�ֺ���һ����
But I gotta float my stick same as you.

763
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:47,176
�Ҵ���û��������һ���Ҳ��ò��е��߳ܡ�
I never saw one of them I had to be ashamed of.

764
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,913
����ͼ���ǰ����
Join in and keep moving.

Hold on!

772
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:56,008

Stay in the wagon. Keep everybody in the wagons.

773
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,408

And don't unhitch.

All this circle's doing is protect the horses. We gotta turn some wagons over.

776
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:34,448
�ʹ��������?��������ǵ�������
And stay here? That's what they expect.

777
01:17:34,582 --> 01:17:35,981

We gotta do what they don't expect.

778
01:17:36,082 --> 01:17:38,744

That's why all the heavy artillery's in Buffalo's wagon.

Circle the wagons.
