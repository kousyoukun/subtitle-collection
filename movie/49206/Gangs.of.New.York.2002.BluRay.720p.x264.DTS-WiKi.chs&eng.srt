血要留在刀刃上
The blood stays on the blade.

3
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,460
总有一天你会明白的
One day you'll understand.

4
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,860
关于往事我只剩一半记忆
Some of it I half remember.

5
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,360
其余的...
And the rest...

6
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,660
其余的从梦里得来
The rest I took from dreams.

帮助我们对抗魔鬼的邪恶和陷阱

10
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,160
好了  孩子  那是谁?
Now, son, who's that?

11
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,160
圣米歇尔  上面是谁?

12
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,260
-圣米歇尔  -他的使命?
-St. Michael! -And what did he do?

13
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,160
他把撒旦逐出天堂
He cast Satan out of paradise.

14
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,560
好孩子
Good boy.

15
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,660
主将圣灵的力量注入你们的脊梁...
May God put the steel of the Holy Spirit in your spine...

16
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,660
...将圣母的爱放入你们的心中
...and the love of the Blessed Virgin in your heart.

17
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,160

20
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,660
蒙克...
Well, well, Monk.

21
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,960
你是否随我们去?
Are you with us or not?

22
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,260
最后一次了  瓦伦如果开价合理我就去
For the last time, Vallon, I'm with you if the money is right.

23
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,160
每条刀痕10元
I'll give you 10 per notch.

24
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,060
-10元?  -我说话算数
-Ten? -You have my word.

25
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,060
-每条刀痕10元?  -新的才算数

26
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,660
我为你们效力
Then I'm your man.

27
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,260
就这么些人?牧师?  教皇陛下的新人马?
Is this it, Priest? The pope's new army?

28
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,860
几条莽汉和贱民?
A few crusty bitches and a handful of ragtags?

29
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,560
比尔  你说过这是勇者之战
Now, now, Bill, you swore this was a battle between warriors...

30
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,060
...可不是泼妇骂街
...not a bunch of Miss Nancys.

31
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,160
所以我只把战士带来了
So warriors is what I brought.

32
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,460
奥康尔卫士帮
The O'Connell Guard.

33
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,160

36
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,270
四十大盗帮
The forty Thieves.

37
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,070
我发出挑战...
On my challenge...

38
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,970
...依据决斗的老规矩
...by the ancient laws of combat, we have met at this chosen ground...

39
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,570
...我们选择在此决斗...
...to settle, for good and all...

40
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,670
...以决定哪方永久持有五点区的控制权
...who holds sway over the Five Points:

41
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,670
决定这块乐土是归于土生土长的地头蛇
Us Natives, born right-wise to this fine land...

42
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,870
...还是沦落于外国蛮子控制之下
...or the foreign hordes defiling it.

43
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,470
依据决斗的老规矩  我接受所谓本地帮的挑战
By the ancient laws of combat, I accept the challenge of the so-called Natives.

44
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,170
你们常陷我们于水火之中
You plague our people at every turn.

45
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,170
从今天起  你们无法再欺凌我们
But from this day out, you shall plague us no more.

46
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,070
我们要让大家知道  想把我们推出这片土地的手...
For let it be known that the hand that tries to strike us from this land...

47
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,070
...理应一刀砍去
...shall be swiftly cut down.

48
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,570
让基督教徒藉主的指引
Then may the Christian Lord guide my hand...

49
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,070
...对抗你们这帮天主教徒
...against your Roman popery!

50
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,070
准备迎纳真正的主吧
Prepare to receive the true Lord!

51
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,970
牧师
Priest!

52
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,470
看着我
Look to me.

53
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,770
谁倒在我的刀下?
Who is this under my knife?

54
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,370
爸爸  起来  起来
Father, get up. Get up!

55
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,070
你在哪?  你在哪?
Where are you? Where are you?

56
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,070
我的孩子
Oh, my son.

57
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,970
别把脸转过去
Don't never look away.

58
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,870
很快就结束了  牧师
Soon be over, Priest.

59
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,770
了结我吧
Finish it.

60
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,770
了结我吧
You may need this across the river.

61
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,170
可以割下鼻子耳朵作为今天的战利品
Ears and noses will be the trophies of the day.

62
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,670
但此人谁也不许碰
But no hand shall touch him!

63
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,770
谁也不许碰他
No hand shall touch him!

64
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,370
他死得...
He'll cross over whole...

65
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,070
...有尊严
...in honor.

66
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,970
先让我拿走他欠我的钱
Not before I get what's owed.

67
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,670
别动
No!

68
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,070
很公平  虽然不是很得体  但很公平
It's fair. A touch indelicate, but fair.

69
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,770
我深表同情
My sympathies.

70
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,370
怎么处理这小子?
What will we do with the boy?

71
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,980
看着我
Look at me.

72
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,280
把他交给警察
Give him to the law.

73
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,180
他能受到好的教育
See he gets a good education.

74
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,780
小子  和你爸爸道别吧
Okay, boy, say goodbye to your father.

75
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,080
-抓住他  -抓住他
-Get him! -Get him!

76
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,580
别让他跑了
Don't let him get away.

77
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,080
快点  来这
Hurry, come in here!

78
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,980
他跑到下面去了
He's going downstairs.

79
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,680
过来  小子
Come here, boy.

80
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,680
-你跑不了了  小子  -他在这  抓住他
-You're going to Hellgate, son. -There he is. Get him.

81
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,780
牧师瓦伦死的光荣
- Priest Vallon died a noble death... - Let go of me!

82
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,380
他的死兔帮也寿终正寝了
...but his Dead Rabbits is done and outlawed!

83
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,180
从今往后谁也不许提到这些名字
Let no one even speak their name from this time on.

84
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,380
在这个地方  在这个地方
In this place, you have grown from a boy into a man.

85
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,980
要摒弃你过去种种罪孽  无仁  无义
Put to death the earthly things in you: Immorality, impurity...

86
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,880
冲动  报复欲
...passion, vengeance.

87
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,280
主已经宽恕了你
The Lord has forgiven you.

88
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,780
你也必须宽恕自己
You also must forgive.

89
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,280
你要前往一个因暴力争斗而四分五裂的地区(罪人之路艰难困苦)
You go forth to a country torn apart by civil strife.

90
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,680
谢谢您  牧师
Thank you, Reverend.

91
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,480
为未竟之事业尽一份力
Lend your hand to the work that yet remains...

92
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,880
...希望纷争可以结束...
...that this war may end...

93
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,380
...给人类带来巨大灾难的奴隶制度...
...and the plague of slavery that brought this conflagration...

94
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,880
...在地球上消失无踪
...down upon us vanish forever from the earth.

95
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,480
南北战争的第二年
In the second year of the Civil War...

96
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,280
...正是爱尔兰人上街游行的时候...
...when the Irish Brigade marched in the streets...

97
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,380
...纽约是个族裔众多...
...New York was a city full of tribes...

98
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,980
...军官林立  贫富纷杂的都市
...war chiefs, rich and poor.

99
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,880
-打倒林肯  -林肯想把所有白人变成奴隶
-Down with Lincoln! - Lincoln will make all white men slaves.

100
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,980
这真算不上是一个城市
It wasn 't a city really.

101
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,480
更象是一个大熔炉  也许某天能融会锻造出一个城市来
It was more a furnace where a city someday might be forged.

102
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,380
就是这样  小伙子们
That's the spirit, boys.

103
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,880
快为你们的黑鬼朋友送命去吧  打倒废奴者
- Go off and die for your blackie friends. - Down with the abolitionists!

104
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,280
我们得找机会选出一个更强有力的人物来对抗林肯
We shoule run a better man against Lincoln when we had the chance.

105
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,280
纽约要脱离联邦
New York should secede from the Union!

106
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,180
他想尽力表明我们和黑鬼们没区别?
They trying to say we're no different than niggers?

107
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,280
当然有区别  -晚上好  兄弟  -上帝拯救联邦
You ain't. Good evening, brother.

108
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,680
-上帝拯救联邦  这就是联邦
-Praise the Union. - The Union forever!

109
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,680
滚回非洲去  黑鬼
Go back to Africa, nigger!

110
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,080
滚回非洲去  -放开他  我们自由了
-Go back to Africa! -Leave him alone. We're free.

111
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,380
最引起公愤的是新征兵法
The angriest talk was of the new Conscription Act...

112
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,380
联邦史上头号征兵法
...the first draft in Union history.

113
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,080
参军吧  小伙子  一天三餐  待遇优厚
Join the Army, lads. Three square meals a day and good pay in your pocket.

114
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,680
爱尔兰人来的时候  这个城市一片狂热
When the Irish came, the city was in a fever.

115
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,280
自本土发生大饥荒以来  爱尔兰人乘船如潮水般涌至
Since the time of the great famine, they'd come streaming off the boats.

116
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,380
他们受到了热烈的欢迎
And they got a right warm welcome.

117
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,880
-滚回家去  爱尔兰傻瓜  -记住了  死鬼爱尔兰人
-Go back to Ireland, you dumb micks! -Remember that, you Irish gyps!

118
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,080
滚回船上去
Get back on the boat, Paddy!

119
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,880
我来自船程仅两小时的地狱门
I only came two hours downriver from Hellgate.

120
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,480
可别人把我当成外来移民
But they all took me for an immigrant.

121
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,680
为什么不呢?  纽约本地就有上千种口音
Why not? There were a thousand different accents in New York.

122
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,480
我和移民也没不同
And to the Natives, you see, we was all the same.

123
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,180
欢迎来到美国  孩子  漫长艰巨的旅途结束了
Welcome to America, son. Your long, arduous journey is over.

124
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,880
-滚回你的国家去  -投坦慕尼一票
-Go back to your own country! -Vote Tammany!

125
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,780
纽约对威廉.特威德既爱且恨
New York loved William Tweed and hated him.

126
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,280
我们这些想作小偷的人  忍不住对他肃然起敬
And those of us trying to be thieves, well, we couldn 't help but admire him.

127
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,980
卡丁先生  先生们  多谢光临  非常荣幸
Mr. Cutting, gentlemen, thank you for coming. It's an honor.

128
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,980
特威德先生
Mr. Tweed.

129
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,380
先生  请别这样
Sir, please. Excuse me.

130
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,980
-你吓着它们了  -那怎么了?
-I think you're frightening them. -So?

131
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,780
别介意  他以前是爱尔兰人
Don't mind him. He used to be an Irishman.

132
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,080
五点区
Ah, the Five Points.

133
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,280
杀手巷  碎砖大楼  地狱门
Murderers' Alley. Brickbat Mansion. The Gates of Hell.

134

I thought you said you was hungry.

260
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,400
尽可能多拿些!  快走吧!
Grab what you can, Johnny. Let's get out of here.

261
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,000
需要我告诉你这座房子会烧会灰吗?
May I point out that this building is burning to ashes?

262
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,400
需要我告诉你这里是属于阿梅里克斯消防队管辖的区域
May I point out this area is the province of my own Americus fire Brigade...

263
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,100
你们的范围仅限于鲍瑞吗?
...and that you lot belong only in the Bowery?

264
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,400
需要我告诉你你们已经处于下风  劣势
May I point out that you're outmanned, outmaneuvered...

265
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,700
并且快要被打败了吗?
...and, in a moment, outfought?

266
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,700
是吗?
Am I?

267
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,600
黑杰克在这里让他们别挡道
There's the Black Joke! Let's take them on the cobbles.

268
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,100
去饱揍他们一顿
Go spill some claret, boys. Go on, Shorty, have a nice muss.

269
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,000
为屠夫比尔开道
Clear the way for Bill the Butcher.

270
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,300
好吧  小伙子们  动手吧
Okay, boys, to work.

271
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,200
到底要干什么?  屋里值钱的东西差不多全烧光了
What's the point? The fire's near burned anything of value inside.

272
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,600
小伙子们  别管这幢了  去旁边那幢
Boys, forget that one. Next building over.

273
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,700
不能让火蔓延开  那房子的东西随便拿
Mustn't let it spread. Take what you want from that one.

274
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,900
你们干什么?
What are you doing?

275
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,800
这房子没问题啊  这是我的房子
There's nothing wrong with this one. This is my house.

276
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,200
-约翰尼  -救命
-Johnny! -Help!

277
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,800
-约翰尼  -救命
- Johnny! -Help!

278
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,000
救命  救命
Help! Help!

279
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,800
救命
Help!

280
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,000
快走  快走  约翰尼  起来
Come on. Come on, Johnny, get up.

281
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,300
别拿了
Leave that!

282
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,000
你们俩快走开
You two, out of the way!

283
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,600
他叫阿姆斯特丹
His name's Amsterdam.

284
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,100
货色如何?  还行
- How's the beak? - Ain't so bad.

285
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,300
你  有东西就交出来  要不就出去
You. You got anything, you give it up or you get out.

286
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,500
就这些?
Is that it?

287
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,900
就这些
That's it.

288
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,600
好了  跟你说规矩  交来这的所有东西  由我们变卖
Right. Here's the rake. Everything comes here. We fence it.

289
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,200
约翰尼把贡金交给本地帮  然后我们分配所得
Johnny takes our tribute to the Natives, and we chop up the winnings...

290
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,900
根据每个人在帮中的地位
...each to his equal portion, amongst the gang.

291
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,500
这规矩你满意吗?地狱门?
Does that meet with your approval, Hellgate?

292
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,500
我满意吗?
My approval?

293
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,500
什么意思?杰克你不会自己动脑子吗?
What's the matter, Jack Sprat? Can't think for yourself?

294
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,100
-我撕烂你的喉咙  -来呀
-I'll slit your fucking throat! -Hey, come on!

295
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,000
你们分赃之前该先和我算算帐
You boys will settle with me before settling with each other.

296
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,200
我来要我的份子钱
I come for my due and proper.

297
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,310
收获不小啊
Well, this ain't a bad haul.

298
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,310
别人问我这个关于国家前景我怎么说吗?
When folks start in to saying to where the country is going to hell...

299
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:29,110
...我总是告诉他们  '到五点区去观摩那些棒小伙多么辛勤工作就知道了...
...I always tell them, "You just look at all the hard work..our fine young lads is doing down in the Five Points."

300
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:33,210
这东西送穆拉尼夫人正合适
Oh, yeah. Now this is just the thing for Mrs. Mulraney.

301
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,310
这东西送穆拉尼夫人正合适给我们留点东西孝敬屠夫比尔
All right there, Happy Jack, leave us something...to quarter to Bill the Butcher, eh?

302
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,110
行吗?
Would you?

303
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,210
这音乐我不喜欢
Not my favorite tune.

304
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,610
谢了  小伙子们
Thank you, boys.

305
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,210
你们没事了
You keep out of trouble now.

306
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,310
每年本地帮一次次地庆祝我父亲的死...
Every year the Natives celebrated the killing of my father all over again...

307
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:36,010
...地点就在莫特街中国麻将馆
...at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda in Mott Street.

308
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,010
中国人比我们还恨本地帮
The Chinks hated the Natives worse than we did.

309
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,010
当鼓声响起屠夫会喝下一杯火酒
The drum rolls, and the Butcher drinks a glass of fire.

310
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,710
要杀死一位国王
When you kill a king...

311
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,210
2分钟你不该在黑暗中狙杀他
...you don 't stab him in the dark.

312
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,810
而要在众目睽睽之下杀了他
You kill him where the whole court can watch him die.

313
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,310
有火吗?
Hey, you got any timber?

314
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,110
-麦琪  左耳还是右耳?  -快给我们酒喝 你这白痴
-Hey, Maggie. Right ear or left ear? -Give us a drink, you idiot.

315
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,010
自己动手吧
Help yourself.

316
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,010
-最后押注!  -为健康干杯
-Final bets! -To health.

317
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,210
快下注吧  最后2分钟
Place your bets. Betting closes in two minutes.

318
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,710
快下注吧
Place your bets.

319
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,910
先生们  比赛要开始了
Gentlemen, the match is due to commence.

320
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,710
数目是三分钟内吃掉25只老鼠
The count to beat is 25 rodents in three minutes.

321
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,210
鼠狗大战
Towser against the vermin.

322
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,110
-大家满意吗?  -50
-Are the enumerators satisfied? -Fifty!

323
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,410
-好的  -放出来吧
-Yes! -Let them go!

324
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,310
-你要干什么  小伙子?  -我来给比尔进贡
-Where you going, boy? -I'm here to pay tribute to Bill.

325
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,910
是吗?  把钱给我  我交给他
Are you now? Give it to me. I'll give it to him.

326
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,910
不用了  多谢  还是我自己来吧
No, thanks. I'll give it to him myself.

327
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,010
你是想留着你的牙齿还是钱?
What do you want to keep, the money or your teeth?

328
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,910
约翰
John.

329
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,410
欢迎
Welcome.

330
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,910
我和我的朋友的  先生
From me and me lads, sir.

331
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,810
你的朋友?  他是哪来的?
Mate of yours? Where's he from?

332
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,810
他不是本地人  先生
Oh, he's not from here, sir.

333
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,210
你
You.

334
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,710
别再走近了
That's close enough.

335
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,310
你朋友没有看着我的眼睛  这可不是很有礼貌的行为
Your friend can't look me in the eye. That's not an admirable characteristic.

336
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,410
没人能看着你的眼睛  比尔  尤其是你玩牌的时候
No one can look you in the eye, Bill. Not when you're playing cards.

337
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,710
这是惠斯特  绅士的游戏  下注该有个绅士的样子
This is whist. It's a gentleman's game. Make a gentleman's bet.

338
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,310
-我下得够大了  比尔  -不够大
-I'm betting large, Bill. -That ain't large.

339
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,010
拜托别再嚷嚷了  哈威
Please, don't make that noise again, Harvey.

340
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,810
我喜欢对财富极度渴望的人
I like a man who's willing to burn for his swag.

341
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,910
你水性好吗?  走近点
How do you fare on water? Come closer.

342
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,310
近点  约翰  我不会咬人的 再近点
Close, John. I ain't gonna bite. Close.

343
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,710
有一艘葡萄牙船停靠在港口  有三个星期的检疫期
There's a Portuguese ship lying low in the harbor, quarantined three weeks.

344
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,010
趁黎明小子洗劫前下手
Get there before the Daybreak Boys strip her...

345
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,910
2分钟可能我们还得仔细商量一下
...maybe you and me will talk more.

346
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,610
-没问题  先生  -好样的
-Consider it done, sir. -Good boy.

347
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,420
你  叫什么名字?  你叫什么名字?
And you, whatever your name is... What is your name?

348
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:28,320
-阿姆斯特丹  先生  -阿姆斯特丹  那我就叫纽约(注：纽约前名阿姆斯特丹)
-Amsterdam, sir. -Amsterdam. I'm New York.

349
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,220
下次来别再一毛不拔了
Don't you never come in here empty-handed again.

350
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,720
你得有所付出  讨讨我手下欢心
You gotta pay for the pleasure of my company.

351
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,920
带上他一起行动  约翰
Take him for a boat ride, John.

352
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,120
也许他能再救你一命
Who knows, but he might save your life again.

353
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,620
被黎明小子抓到  会割断我们的喉咙
The Daybreak Boys catch us, they'll slit our throats.

354
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,520
你要不闭嘴我就割断你的喉咙
I'll do it myself in a minute if you don't keep quiet.

355
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,820
我不喜欢入夜后的港口
I never liked the harbor after dark.

356
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,220
每天晚上都有士兵的尸体运来
And now each night they brung ashore the bodies of the soldiers.

357
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,420
许多母亲甚至不知道儿子战死在何方
Many mothers have not even the solace...

358
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,020
不知道儿子战死在何方
...of knowing where their sons have fallen.

359
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,920
安提塔姆战役中我失去了长子
I lost my own eldest at Antietam.

360
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,620
我和他母亲至今无法找回遗体
His mother and I were unable to recover his remains.

361
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,520
那是幅悲惨的景象  战争不能永远持续下去
-It was a mournful sight. -The war can't last forever.

362
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,420
可我们有自己的事要作
But we had business of our own.

363
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,020
黎明小子已经来过了  洗劫一空  回去吧
The Daybreak Boys have been here, and there's nothing left. Let's go back.

364
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,220
怎么回事
What the hell?

365
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,220
吉米  趴下
Jimmy, get down!

366
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,320
天啊  一定会把警察引来
Jesus, than bring the harbor cops for sure. Fuck off.

367
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,220
去看看吧
Let's take a look.

368
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,220
天啊  他们杀得鸡犬不留
Jesus, they killed everybody.

369
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,220
除了一堆死螃蟹什么都没剩下
There's nothing here but a bunch of dead sea-crabs.

370
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,720
快  走吧
Come on, let's go.

371
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,720
-开船  -别走  等等阿姆斯特丹
-Shove off. - No, wait for Amsterdam.

372
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,120
阿姆斯特丹在哪?
Where's Amsterdam?

373
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,120
-笨蛋  截住他  -你在干什么?!
-No, you damn fool, take him! -What in the hell for?!

374
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,420
看看我的货  不少于15美金
Look in my glims. I said no less than 15.

375
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,920
-新鲜吗  -最多4小时
-Is this fresh? -Four hours most.

376
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,820
非常感谢  先生们
Much obliged, gents.

377
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,020
那是什么词?
What's that word?

378
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,220
-意思是拿尸体  -不是问意思
-It means body snatchers. -I didn't ask the meaning.

379
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,720
我问是个什么词
I asked the word.

380
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,920
盗尸者
Ghoul.

381
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,820
盗尸者?  好词
Ghoul? That's a good word.

382
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:55,220
"盗尸帮杀人  五点区最新暴行"
"Ghoul Gang Slaughters. A fresh Outrage in the Five Points."

383
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,020
-这标题你应该感到自豪  -多谢
-That's a notice you can be proud of. -Thank you.

384
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,920
没出息  这么对待尸体
A low thing, to do that to a body. Low.

385
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,420
为什么?  他们原本会空手而归
Why? They could have left that ship with nothing.

386
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,720
可结果他们上了《警察宪报》 一份定期刊物
Instead they made The Police Gazette, a periodical of note.

387
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,320
尸体应该埋在地下
A body's supposed to stay beneath the earth...

388
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,620
384穿着木衣直到重生
...wearing a wooden coat until the Resurrection.

389
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,820
这俩人和你一样都是爱尔兰人的后代
These two are a pair of sons of Irish bitches, same as you.

390
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,020
别再搞他们了
It don't seem to bother them none.

391
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,120
也许他们和你的是非观念不同吧
But then maybe they don't share your religious scruples.

392
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,020
也许他们只是一对'费德兰奔'(Fidlam bens：黑话  什么都偷的贼)
Maybe they're just a couple of fidlam Bens.

393
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,520
叫我什么的都有  可从没人叫我...
I've been called a lot of things, mister, but I ain't never been called...

394
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,420
-费德兰奔  -费德兰奔  没氏
-Fidlam Bens. -Fidlam Bens. Right.

395
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:45,920
如果我知道确切意思  我可能会反击
Well, if I knew what in the hell that meant, I'd be inclined to take offense.

396
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,320
费德兰奔就是什么都偷的人  不论死活
A fidlam Bens is a fellow who steals anything, dead or alive...

397
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,620
384太没出息以至无法建立任何形象
...because he's too low to work up a decent lay for himself.

398
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,220
小心点  屠夫  小心点
Count that careful, Bill. Count that careful.

399
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,220
-我告诉你他们就给了这么多  -小毛贼
-I'm telling you, that's all there is... -Now, chiseler...

400
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,020
你说我们是小毛贼  这个词我明白  你知道吗?
If you'd said "chiseler," now there's a word I understand. You know?

401
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,220
-你是这么叫我们吗?  -我能想出一大堆名词称呼你们
-Now, is that what you're calling us? -I can think of many things to call you.

402
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,720
如果我问你是否称我们为'小毛贼'?
Right. But I asked if you was calling us chiselers.

403
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,720
是又如何?
Supposing I am?

404
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,320
那局面就不好收拾了
Well, then we got business.

405
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,620
来吧
That we do.

406
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,320
两块押麦格罗恩
-A fight! There's a fight! -Two bucks on McGloin.

407
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,920
-四块押小伙子  -四块押小伙子
-Four bits on the kid. -Five bits on the kid.

408
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,020
五块押阿姆斯特丹!
I got two on Amsterdam.

409
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,920
上啊  麦格罗恩他不过是个小毛头
Come on, McGloin, he's just a kid.

410
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,020
押回阿姆斯特丹四块
Four bits to back Amsterdam.

411
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,620
小心他的左拳  麦格罗恩
Watch his left, McGloin. Watch his left.

412
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,320
-行了  够了  够了  -你还有什么可说的?
-All right, l do. l do. -Anything to say now, huh?!

413
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,220
行了  拉开他吧
OK, for chrissake. Drag him off.

414
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,520
-够了  小子  你赢了  -行了  小子  你赢了  别犯傻了
-That's enough, kid. -You got him. Come on, kid, you won.

415
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,520
麦格罗恩 他是个孩子
McGloin. He's a kid too, McGloin.

416
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,320
你太老了  麦格罗恩
You're getting too old for it, McGloin.

417
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,220
麦格罗恩  没鼻子耳朵的脑袋看起来是什么样的?
McGloin, how would that head look without the ears and the nose on it?

418
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,920
这种脑袋你最好别碰  比尔
You'd better leave that head alone, Bill.

419
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,630
我要把那脑袋的鼻子耳朵削掉
I think I'm gonna trim the ears and the beak off of that head.

420
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,130
用这脑袋做碗好汤
Make a nice pot of soup of that head.

421
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,030
有比这脑袋好味的脑袋  比尔
You could find a tastier head than that, Bill.

422
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,630
没爱尔兰炖肉我根本没胃口
I ain't got the stomach for no Irish stew.

423
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:48,130
大名鼎鼎的麦格罗恩差点成了个后生的手下败将
The mighty McGloin almost fishhooked by a sprat.

424
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,030
第七天上帝休息  在休息前
On the seventh day, the Lord rested, but before that he did...

425
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:06,930
他蹲在英格兰旁边 拉出来的东西  就是爱尔兰
...he squatted over the side of England, and what came out of him was Ireland.

426
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:11,230
-没有冒犯你的意思  -没关系  先生  我是在这长大的
-No offense, son. -Oh, none taken, sir. I grew up here.

427
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,930
关于爱尔兰的一切我都是在孤儿院听别人说的
All I ever knew of Ireland was in the talk of the others at the orphan asylum.

428
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,030
你的祖先产在那个粪便岛的那个部位?
In which part of that excrementitious isle were your forebears spawned?

429
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:26,830
我听说是克立  可从孤儿院起我就无法从口音证实这点了
I've been told Kerry, but I lost proof of it in my language at the asylum.

430
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,330
我也在相似的环境中长大
I was raised in a very similar establishment myself.

431
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,930
你看到属于我的东西都是某阶段的产物
Now everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another.

432
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,230
天堂广场的乞丐  报童和小贼
The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise.

433
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,830
有钱的海员和低级酒吧  码头边劣质威士忌
The sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront.

盎格鲁人  双性人和中国人
The anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks.

435
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,130
每个人都欠我钱  每个人都要付我钱
Everybody owes, everybody pays...

436
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:52,030
384只有如此才能逆流而上  成长起来
...because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide.

437
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:55,530
-我说的对吗?  -没错  比尔
-Is that right, boys? -Yeah, Bill. That's right.

438
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,930
加入我们的行列  为国效力

We need 30,000 volunteers, and we're prepared to pay $677 per volunteer.

442
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,630
-请看看这个  -谢谢
-Please read this. Thank you. -Thanks.

443
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,230
你要拿一张来填吗?
Would you like to take one of these to fill out?

444
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,930
一日管三餐  一日管三餐
Three square meals a day. Three square meals a day.

445
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,830
年轻人  应征入伍报效国家

446
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:24,030
一日管三餐  先生
Three square meals a day, gentlemen.

447
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,830
如果有兴趣  建议你看一下这个再决定是否应征
If you're interested, read this and consider joining.

448
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,930
走到哪里人们都在谈论征兵
Everywhere you went people talked about the draft.

449
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,230
支付300美元可免于应征
Now, you could buy your way out for $300...

450
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,530
可谁有300美元呢?
...but who had $300?

451
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,430
对我们来说和三百万也没区别
For us it might as well have been 3 million.

452
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,530
对于征兵人员  他们害怕黑帮会找上我们
The recruiters? They was too scared of the gangs to come after us.

453
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,530
而且  我们从没想过战争会打到纽约
Besides, we never dreamt the war would ever touch New York.

454
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,230
早晨好  先生
Good morning, sir.

455
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,630
你!
You!

456
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,830
你可别撞上我
Don't you run into me.

457
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,830
一报还一报
Fair enough.

458
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,830
我说了别撞我的
I said, don't run into me!

459
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,130
对不起
Well, sorry.

460
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,230
-没丢东西吧?  -好象没有
-Everything in place? -It seems so.

461
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,430
那我就留你继续享受上帝的恩惠和关怀
Well, then I leave you in the grace and favor of the Lord.

462
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,830
-多谢  -好了
-Thank you. -That's right.

463
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,630
这个死丫头
Oh, the dirty mab!

464
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,030
不
Oh, no.

465
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,630
-对不起-我来
-I'm sorry. -Allow me.

466
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,330
-多谢你的好意  先生  -乐意效劳
-Thank you kindly, sir. -Oh, it's my pleasure.

467
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,330
我希望你不会觉得我很冒昧
I hope you won't think me rude if I speak.

468
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,730
否则我还是闭口为妙
I wouldn't want to appear forward.

469
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,530
先生  那要看你说什么
Well, sir, that depends on what you say.

470
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,030
如果我夸你是纽约最漂亮的女孩你会认为我很鲁莽吗?
Would you call me reckless if I said you were the prettiest girl in New York?

471
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,930
只是在纽约吗?
Only New York?

472
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,030
我到站了
This is my stop.

473
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,130
我可以陪你走一会儿吗?
May I walk with you a little then?

474
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,030
先生  这样太鲁莽了
That, sir, would be too bold.

475
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:41,830
早上好
Good morning.

476
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,730
不同的小偷有不同的外号

偷得神不知鬼不觉
Robs you blind.

487
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:33,130
做斑鸠需要勇气过人
It takes a lot of sand to be a turtledove.

488
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:59,230
把圣牌还给我  天啊
I'll have my medal back. Oh, Jesus!

489
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:07,830
别再这么做
Don't do that again.

490
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,830
听着  我说别再这么做了

Go back to the Points and leave me to my business...

...or I will open your throat, so help me God.

493
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,130
好吧
All right.

494
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,730

那动手吧
Go on then.

497
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,640

他们凝视着西方

512
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,440
眺望着天平线寻找陆地的身影
...searching the horizon for a glimpse of land and salvation.

513
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,940
美洲的身影
A glimpse of America.

514
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,340
如此贫困真使人极度不安斯盖马洪小姐
Seeing all this poverty must be most unsettling, Miss Schermerhorn.

515
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,140
有时富人区的帮派也会来到我们这
Some days, of course, the uptown gangs come down to us.

516
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,340
斯盖马洪家族就是纽约历史最悠久的帮派之一
The Schermerhorns was one of the oldest families in New York.

517
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,240
城市虽然不由他们管理
They didn 't run the city...

518
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,840
可他们的影响力却举足轻重
...but they was listened to carefully by them that did.

519
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,840
布兰特专员说你希望考察一下五点区的各个层面
Commissioner Brunt said you wished to view...

520
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,340
他说'考察一下不需要动员什么人力物力'
...the Points in all its splendor and squalor.

521
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,740
除了动用我们以保证安全康斯特布尔
"Spare nothing concerning the conditions," said he.

522
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,840
有康斯特布尔及手下陪同
Yeah, nothing except our safety, constable.

523
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,540
我们会很安全的
I'm sure we can be in no danger while we're in the constable's company.

524
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,240
没问题  女士  作个见证
Quite so, madam. Witness.

525
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,540
-我们还要继续吗?  -你居然敢把这东西留在这?
-Shall we continue on? -What, you dare to leave it there?

526
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,240
和存款一样安全大家都知道这是我的东西
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greeley, since all know it's mine.

527
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,640
-这人喝醉了吗?  -此人已死  正如耶稣受难一般
-Is that man drunk? -Dead as Good friday, miss.

528
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,440
-你好  穆兰尼  -伙计们
-Good day to you, Mulraney. -Boys.

529
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,340
-杰克  -贫民窟还挺友善吧?
-Jack. -Slum sociable?

530
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,940
考察实情  有志改革
Fact-finding. Reforms-studying.

531
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,540
-我来介绍一下?  -第5街的斯盖马洪家族
-May I present...? -The Schermerhorns of fifth Avenue...

532
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,940
用不着你来介绍
...scarcely require an introduction from you.

533
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,440
斯盖马洪以及他们的女儿
Schermerhorn, indeed. Their daughter. This gentleman, of course...

534
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,840
霍雷斯.葛瑞利先生  著名的出版人  很高兴也很荣幸见到你
Horace Greeley, the famous publisher. A pleasure and an honor.

535
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,040
-《论坛报》的  -我是威廉・卡丁
-Of the Tribune. - I'm William Cutting.

536
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,840
你好  卡丁先生
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?

537
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:28,340
此刻  非常好  多谢  你呢
As of this moment, extremely well, thank you. How do you do?

538
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
橙花香  好美妙
Orange blossom. Delicious.

539
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,440
-卡丁先生是  -多讨人喜欢的美女啊
-Mr. Cutting is... -What a peach.

540
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,640
她在舞台上一定能大有作为
She could have a fine career on the stage.

541
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,340
...五点区的一位...  -幸会  先生
...one of Five Points' local... -A pleasure to meet you.

-Pleased to meet you. -The Points welcomes you.

544
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,440
这些大街小巷对你们都安全无阻
You are welcome to these streets and will pass in safety.

545
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,140
我会保证他们的安全的  多谢  比尔
Oh, I'll see to their safety. Thank you, Bill. There we are.

546
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,840
告辞了  小伙子们  罪犯都是牛皮哄哄的  你看到了
Good day, lads. Criminal's braggadocio, you see.

547
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,240
-他知道我是谁  -当然  先生  你在这里可以大名鼎鼎
-He knows who I am. -You're well-known in these parts.

548
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,940
必须得承认这句话是吹捧
I must say that I find that strangely flattering.

549
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,740
-我从来不喜欢警察  -不夸张地说
-I never did like crushers. -Well, draw it mild, son.

550
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,440
不是我给他出谋划策  杰克绝对没这么称心如意
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs without I tell him he may do so.

551
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:26,940
你认为我的表挂在灯杆上安全吗  比尔?
Do you think my watch would be safe up on that lamppost, Bill?

552
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,740
你不如挂在那试试?
Why don't you hang it up there and see?

553
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,840
改天吧
Someday.

554
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,140
改天很明智
Someday is right.

555
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,940
你的新马仔?
This a new lad?

556
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:47,740
不过是又一个投入我温暖怀抱的爱尔兰混小子而已
Just another bastard son of Erin I folded in the warmth of my embrace.

557
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,440
-我只想看看你长什么样
-Hey! - I just want to see your face, son.

558
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,740
不要故意伤害
No harm intended.

559
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,940
你得学习很多屠宰的手艺
You get to know a lot butchering meat.

560
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,840
人体由同样的东西组成  血与肉
We're made up of the same things: Flesh and blood...

561
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,240
组织  器官
...tissue, organs.

562
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,140
我喜欢摆弄猪
I love to work with pigs.

563
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,540
自然界和人肉最近似的东西就是猪肉
The nearest thing in nature to the flesh of a man is the flesh of a pig.

564
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,940
-猪肉?  -没错
-Pig, huh? -That's right.

565
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,740
这是给你的  母亲
This is for you, mother.

566
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,540
你来了
There you go.

567
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,740
-上帝保佑你  卡丁先生  -上帝保佑你
-God bless you, Mr. Cutting. -God bless you.

568
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,340
-她肯定不是你亲娘  -我知道  比尔
-She ain't really my mother. - I knew that, Bill.

569
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,750
这里是肝脏
This is the liver.

570
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,150
肾脏
The kidneys.

571
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,050
心脏
The heart.

572
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,550
这是薄弱的地方  胃不停地流血
This is a wound. The stomach will bleed and bleed.

573
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,150
这里是致命处  这里是致命处
This is a kill. This is a kill.

574
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,350
大动脉  这里是致命处
The main artery. This is a kill.

575
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,750
你试试
You try.

576
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,250
来吧
Go ahead.

577
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,550
肺  很好  刀刃不要砍在肋骨上
The lung. Good. Don't foul the blade on the rib.

578
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,950
很好  正中动脉
Very good. Main artery.

579
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,850
把目标的血慢慢放出来  让目标死前还能思考一下人生
Bleed him slow. Let him think about it for a while.

580
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,850
-慢死  很好
Slow death. Good.

581
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:05,650
每月拿到5000美元用于城市建设
You'll each bill the city $5000 a month for supplies and services...

582
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,650
其中你可提成10%
...of which you'll receive 10%.

583
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,550
比尔!  奇罗兰先生正在筹划细节  多谢  先生
Bill! Mr. Killoran will work out the details. Thank you, gentlemen.

584
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,750
在坦慕尼身边就是这么工作的
That's how we do things around Tammany, gentlemen.

585
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,950
那两位是谁?
Who's this then?

586
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,850
多谢了  小伙子们
Thank you, boys.

587
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,050
告辞  先生
Good day, sir.

588
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,150
你脑子里在想什么?
You got something on your mind?

589
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,050
比尔很垂青于你
Bill's taken quite a liking to you.

590
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,450
如果你有所图谋  祝你好运吧
Now, if you're up to something, bene.

591
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,950
只是我不想置身其中
Only I don't want no part in it.

592
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,050
我在地狱门关了16年
I was in Hellgate for 16 years.

593
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,850
我只是想混口饭吃
I'm just trying to make my way is all.

594
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,250
就和你一样
Just like you.

595
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,450
除非你有什么更远大的理想
Unless, of course, you got a better notion?

596
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:09,050
我没有
No.

597
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:17,750
接待那些上门投诉五点区罪案的公民搞的我一天什么事都干不了
I can't get a day's work done for all the good citizens coming in here to harass me about crime in the Points.

598
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,450
有人甚至过分到投诉坦慕尼
Some even go so far as to accuse Tammany...

599
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:24,350
纵容五点区罪案猖獗
...of connivance in this so-called rampant criminality.

600
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:27,550
-我能怎么办?  -我没办法  必须得采取一些措施
What am I to do? I can't have this. Something has to be done.

601
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,250
-你怎么打算?  -我不知道
-What do you have in mind? -I don't know.

602
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,650
我们也许该吊死几个人
I think maybe we should hang someone.

603
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,050
-谁?  -不必是重要人物  一般地
-Who? -No one important, necessarily.

604
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:40,650
没什么背景的人物就可以
Average men will do. Back-alley amusers with no affiliations.

605
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,550
-多少?  -三四个
-How many? -Three or four.

606

607
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,650
你被控犯有如下多项罪名
You stand here convicted varyingly...

608
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,950
淫荡  抢劫
...of lewdness, jack-rolling...

609
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,850
偷窃  造假
...sneak-thievery, chloral-hydrating...

610
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:02,750
鸡奸  勒索
...sodomy, strangulation...

611
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:07,750
腐败贪污
...and enthusiastic corruption of the public good.

612
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,250
-某天我们也会如此  -抬起头来
-We all go someday, huh? -Chin up.

613
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,550
要上绞架的真不少  这是我的老朋友
Handsome bunch of gallows fruit. There's my old friend.

614
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,650
-你怎么样  亚瑟?  -我很好  我很好
-How are you feeling, Arthur? -I'm okay. I'm okay.

615
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:19,950
向阿姆斯特丹问个好  麦格罗恩差点成他手下败将
Say hello to Amsterdam. Nearly fishhooked McGloin the other day.

616
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,350
-你好  -差点
-How do you do? -Nearly.

617
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,250
你穿戴得好整齐
See you dressed for the occasion.

618
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,450
你了解我的  我最注重仪表的
You know me, always like to look me best.

619
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,150
不错
That's the spirit.

620
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,650
这小金盒真不错  一块钱卖给我
Nice locket. I'll give you a dollar for it.

621
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,450
是我母亲的
It's me mother's.

622
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,150
一块半如何?
Dollar and a half?

623
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,450

625
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,650
-天国再见  谢墨斯  -热玉米!

626
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:47,950
刚出炉的热玉米  热玉米!
Ears of early white corn! Hot corn!

627
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,150
我的儿子来了吗?
Is my son present here?

628
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:57,650
我的小宝贝在哪?
Where's my little fella?

629
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,550
看着你爸
Look at your dad.

630
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:03,750
永别了  亲爱的孩子
Farewell, dear boy.

631
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:09,850
我从没做过坏事  也没害过人
I never struck a foul blow, nor turned a card.

632
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:16,050
上帝会象迎接老友一样欢迎我
May God greet me as a friend.And grace my fears relieved

633
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:49,750
那晚改良派举行了舞会
How precious Did that grace appear That night, the reformers held a dance.

634
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:52,450
这就是五点区
That was the Five Points, all right.

635
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,850
白天绞人  晚上跳舞
Hangings of a morning, dancings of an evening.

636
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,950
她肯定对我有意思
- Sure meself, but...

637
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,950
从她冲我笑的样子看得出来
...it's not a matter of words. I can tell by the way she smiles at me.

638
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,050
-她对很多人都笑  -先生
-She smiles at a lot of people. - Sir.

639
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,550
你不了解他
You don't know her.

640
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:08,250
给一位爱尔兰战士赏点小钱  年轻人

699
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:59,770
-别告诉我你生气了  -没有

我和你已经结束了
I'm through with you.

701

你比大多数男人说得都快

702

通常他们会等到事后才说

我对屠夫穿过的破鞋没兴趣
I ain't interested in the Butcher's leavings.

704
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:37,070
比尔说胆小鬼就别来了
Hey! Bill says keep clear of the pikers.

每个人都为屠夫打工

我们替他跑腿  帮他挣钱

708
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,470
拿点小钱还得说'多谢  先生'

先生  还没个结果我怎么去收?
How do I collect if no one won the fight?

716
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:10,770
此活动非法  你就凭这个作借口  明白吗?
This counts as a "no decision." You got that covered, right?

717
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,770
难道我没打点警察局吗?
Didn't anybody pay off the police?

718
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,670
我们打点的是市局来的是都会警察

他不是接你的话茬
He don't answer to you.

722
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:24,470
法律规定城市里不允许拳击  对吧?
The law says there's no boxing in the city, right?

723
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,870

It's a funny feeling being took under the wing of a dragon.

740

01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:44,070
把国家交给从未为此奋斗过的人手上吗?
...by giving this country over to them what's had no hand in fighting for it?

为什么?只因为他们远道而来  满身虱虫  向你乞讨吗?
Why? Because they come off a boat, crawling with lice and begging for soup?

797
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,480
他可能在向上帝告解
I think he's making his peace with God.

真是一出活生生的莎翁戏
Now that was bloody Shakespearean.

812
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,880

先生  我不知道你在讲什么鬼话
I don't know what you're talking about.

815
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,580
因为你是个蠢笨无知粗鲁的爱尔兰狗崽子
That's because you're a thick, ignorant, barbarous Irish whelp.

816
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,580
就象你父亲一样
Just like your father.

817
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,080
够了  够了
That's it.

818
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:09,580
你妨碍我行事  破坏我计划  就象这个国家其他愚蠢的爱尔兰人一样
Tear my head off and destruct the world, just like the rest of the stupid Irish.

819
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:15,180
-所以我从未与你父亲并肩战斗过  -放开我  你这个疯子
-That's why I never ran with your dad. -Get off me, you crazy bastard!

820
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,680
意思是'如果你不够强壮  你就得放聪明点'
It means, if you're not strong, you'd better be smart.

821
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,780
我搞不清你是太蠢还是太聪明
I don't know if you're being too clever or too dumb.

01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:10,980
多搅和几次  再拿出来  成了美国式的大杂烩
Stir it around a few times, pull it out, it's a fine American mess.

我以前和你好过吗?
Have I ever had you before?

833
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:31,180
那你不能叫我的教名
So you don't call me by my Christian name.

834
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,880
比尔  感谢上帝你平安无事
Bill! Thank God you're all right.

835
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,280
我一听到消息就尽快赶来了
I heard the news and came as quick as I could.

836
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:39,580
你就象死神一样及时
You're as timely as the Angel of Death.

837
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:44,280
比尔  你不是讽刺我来这吧?  你在暗示什么?
Bill, you're not suggesting that I would stoop to what you're suggesting?

838
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,180
别浪费口水了  如果我认为是你干的  你早上天堂去了
Stop slabbering. If I thought it was you, you'd be in a wooden coat.

01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:51,690
我肩膀上有个洞  很疼  要么请喝杯酒闭上嘴
The hole in my shoulder hurts, so have a drink and shut up.

840
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,290
要么闭上嘴出去
Or shut up and get out.

841
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:56,190
我还是来杯酒吧
I believe I'll have a drink.

小心  特威德  那女人可有花柳病
Careful, Tweedy, the mort's frenchified.

843
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,990
不  我很干净的  走  去酒吧
No, no, I'm clean. Come on, let's go to the bar.

847
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:48,790
你受得了的
You can take it.

848
01:22:58,090 --> 01:22:59,990
这是我的手下
There's my boy.

849
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,590
没事的
It's all right.

850
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,190
为屠夫干杯

01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:27,790
-为屠夫干杯  -为屠夫干杯

854
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:39,090
你别呆在这里  约翰尼
Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?

855
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,590
快走
Go on. Go.

856
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:04,190
五点区有没操过你的人吗?
Is there anyone in the Five Points you haven't fucked?

你敢来我就咬你
Try it and I'll bite you!

860
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:35,290
如果你敢咬我...  你只不过吓吓我  是吗?
If you were gonna bite me, I don't think you'd warn me, huh?

861
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:37,390
试试看
Find out.

862
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:57,090
我睡不着
I can't sleep.

863
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:07,490
希望你别介意我们俩今晚睡在这里
I hope you don't mind us laying out tonight here, sir.

864
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:11,290
你喜欢她哪一点?
Whatever takes your fancy, my young friend.

865
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:23,990
是不是肩膀疼的你睡不着?
Is it your shoulder that's keeping you up?

866
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:27,090
不是  我一向睡得不多
No, I don't never sleep too much.

867

我睡觉时要睁一只眼  可我只有一只眼
I have to sleep with one eye open. I only got one eye, right?

868

你多大了  阿姆斯特丹?
How old are you, Amsterdam?

869
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:46,390
我也确定不了
I'm not too sure.

870
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:48,290
从来没有算过
I never did figure it.

871
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:51,990

冒犯我的人  我割下他的舌头
He offends me, I cut out his tongue.

He rises against me, I cut off his head, stick it on a pike...

879
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:30,190
挂得高高的  让行人都看得到
...and raise it high up so all in the streets can see.

880
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:34,690
如此来维持正常的秩序

恐惧

883
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:46,690
是何许人?
...who was he?

884
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:50,290
什么也不是
A nobody.

885
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:53,290
只是个胆小鬼
A coward.

886
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:58,790
结局是如此地不光彩
What an ignominious end that would have been.

887
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,100
15年前我杀了最后一个值得我尊敬的人  从那以后...
I killed the last honorable man 15 years ago. Since then, it's...

888
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,400
你在楼下见过他的肖像吗?
You've seen his portrait downstairs?

889
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,100
你的嘴是不是被口水沾住了?  我正问你话呢
Is your mouth glued up with cunny juice? I asked you a question!

890
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,600
我说我看见了  先生
I said, I seen it, sir.

891
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,900
你有种爆怒凶狠的气质  我喜欢
Oh, you got a murderous rage in you, and I like it.

892
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:34,300
血气方刚  很好
It's life boiling up inside of you. It's good.

893
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,200
牧师和我的生活准则是一致的
The Priest and me, we lived by the same principles.

894
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,800
不同的信仰使我们分道扬镳
It was only faith divided us.

895
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,000
这就是他的赏赐
He give me this, you know.

896
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:01,000
我被打得最惨的一次

鼻青脸肿

898
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:07,000
肚子也破了  肋骨全折了
...my guts was pierced and my ribs was all mashed up.

899
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,500
他过来结果我的时候
And when he came to finish me...

900
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,300
我都无法盯着他的眼睛
...I couldn't look him in the eye.

901
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:31,900
他饶了我一命因为他想让我耻辱地活着
He spared me because he wanted me to live in shame.

902
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,700
他是个了不起的人物
This was a great man.

903
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,400
了不起的人物
A great man.

904
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,500
所以我干脆剜了这只眼
So I cut out the eye that looked away.

905
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,900
用蓝纸包着送给他
Sent it to him, wrapped in blue paper.

906
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:55,500
如果我瞎了也可与他战斗我会两只眼都剜出来
I would have cut them both out if I could have fought him blind.

907
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,700
我终于重振雄风
Then I rose back up again with a full heart...

908
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,600
用他自己的血埋葬了他
...and buried him in his own blood.

909
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,700
好精彩
Well done.

910
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:21,100
我所杀的人里唯一让我忘不了的
He was the only man I ever killed worth remembering.

911
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:35,300
我没有儿子
I never had a son.

912
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,300
文明正在衰退
Civilization is crumbling.

913
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,640
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

914
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,940
如果你有话要说
If you got anything to say...

915
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,940
现在可以说了
...now is the time to say it.

916
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,240
他到底是你什么人?  珍妮
Who is he to you, Jenny?

917
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,140
我12岁那年
I was 12 years old.

918
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:57,940
母亲去世了  我无家可归
My mother was dead. I was living in a doorway.

919
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:04,740
他带我回家  照顾我...
He took me in, took care of me...

920
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,840
...用他的方式
...in his own way.

921
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:15,540
我打了胎之后
After they cut out the baby...

922
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:21,740
他不喜欢留下疤痕的女孩
Well, he doesn't fancy girls that scarred up.

923
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:32,940
你应该想得到
You should know in your own mind...

924
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:38,240
除非我求他  他根本不会碰我的
...that he never laid a hand on me until I asked him to.

925
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,040
你是谁?
Who are you?

926
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:06,540
你是谁?
Who are you?

927
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:26,740
先生们  先生们  向你们致以最热烈的欢迎
Gentlemen. Fine gentlemen, you are most welcome...

928
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:30,540
此地妙景纷呈  美不胜收
...to this palace of wonder and enchantment...

929
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:38,940
媲美中桑鲁卓描绘的最美妙的幻境
where visions to rival the finest imaginings of Scheherezade...and her tales from the perfumed nights of Arabia...

930
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:43,140
令人目不暇接
...will greet your famished eyes.

931
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:05,340
我怎么为这位亚麻头发的日耳曼美人开价呢?
What am I bid for this flaxen-haired Teutonic beauty?

932
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:11,040
请尽情欣赏这些美艳动人的异国尤物
Feast your eyes on the magnificent plumage of these exotic creatures.

933
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,340
先生们  想必已经看清楚笼中的依人小鸟
Gentlemen, you've seen our caged birds.

934
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:18,640
你如何才能令她们歌唱呢?
Well, how'd you like to make them sing?

935
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:24,940
我来看看你们出的钱  她们终会为你歌唱的
Let me see the color of your money, and they could be singing for you.

936
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:34,540
主将圣灵的力量注入我的脊梁
May God put the steel of the Holy Spirit in my spine...

937
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:39,340
将圣母的爱放入我心
...and the love of the Blessed Virgin in my heart.

938
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,340
阿门
Amen.

939
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:50,240
别紧张
Easy now.

940
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,240
你刚才说什么?
What did you say?

941
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,840
他没说实话
He's not who he says he is.

942
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,540
他没说实话?
He's not who he says he is?

943
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:01,740
怎么开价?  怎么开价?  怎么开价
What am I bid? What am I bid? What am I bid?

944
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,540
亏他还把你当朋友
Count your blessings he considers you a friend.

945
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:11,740
他日日夜夜处心积虑  就是考虑一件事--杀你的万全之策
The only thing he considers, every day and every night, is how best to kill you.

946
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,940
你长着一条嚼不烂的舌头  你是不是想我把它割下来
You got a loose tongue in your head. You want me to take it out for you?

947
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:20,440
然后塞到你的屁眼里去才好?
I'll bury it right up your fundament where it belongs.

948
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:22,840
我看穿你了  你很心虚
I can read right through you. You're empty...

949
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:25,440
他叫瓦伦
His name is Vallon!

950
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:31,040
别动手  比尔
Don't do it, Bill. His name's Vallon.

951
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:05,240
这些来自中国的人好古怪
They're curious people, these Celestials.

952
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:06,840
别信他
Don't trust this guy.

953
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,940
-你知道他为什么穿短袖吗?  -为什么?
-Know why he wears short sleeves? - Why?

954
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,440
是为了让人看到他什么也没藏
So everyone can see he's got nothing stashed.

955
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:14,740
天啊  希望短袖不会成为时尚
Jesus, let's hope that never becomes the fashion.

956
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,040
约翰尼
Johnny.

957
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,140
起来
Get up.

958
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:21,940
女士们  先生们  在此提请您注意
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your kind attention.

959
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:24,740
某些人已经注意到了
As some of you have surely noticed...

960
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:28,840
我们的朋友及捐助人威廉.卡丁先生
...our friend and benefactor Mr. William Cutting...

961
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:35,240
今晚穿了件与众不同的马甲
...is tonight wearing a waistcoat of certain distinction.

962
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:38,240
我们.
Might we...

963
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:43,340
我们呼吁他出来为大家表演...
Might we tonight appeal to him to favor us...

964
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:53,240
集技巧  勇气  胆量于一身的激动人心的节目
...with another exciting exhibition of skill...courage, daring and drama!

965
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:10,140
大马士革之剑
-The Sword of Damascus! -The Tomahawk!

966
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,540
比尔要表演了
Bill's going up.

967
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,540
显显你的刀法
Show us your knives.

968
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,240
大马士革之剑 孩子
Strut your stuff, Billy boy.

969
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:27,840
大马士革之剑
Sword of Damascus!

970
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:44,840
-蜘蛛之吻  -血流成河

971
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:48,540

973
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:53,040
-印第安战斧  -蜘蛛女之吻
-The Tomahawk! -The Spider's Kiss!

974
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:55,240
屠夫的徒弟
The Butcher's Apprentice!

975
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:56,840
屠夫的徒弟
The Butcher's Apprentice.

976
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:00,240
-请继续表演  -请继续表演
-Command performance. -Command performance.

977
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,740
-请继续表演  -你去哪了?
-Command performance. -Where have you been?

978
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,440
我将遵令献艺
A command performance indeed!

979
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,340
我让你离开这里  你还不懂吗?
-Get out of here. -Don't do it.

980
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:12,040
为此  我必须征得我表演节目的老搭档
And for this I must beg the indulgence of my former assistant...

981
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:14,740
的允诺
...in matters of impalement.

982
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:18,240
屠夫的嫡传弟子的允诺
The Butcher's original apprentice.

983
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:24,240
你看如何  珍?  为了纪念过往的合作再来一次?
What do you say, Jen? One more time for the sweet souvenir?

984
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,340
来吧
Come on.

985
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,840
别动
Don't you do it.

986
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,740
好女孩  珍妮
Good girl, Jenny.

987
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:44,640
-别害怕  -好女孩!
-Don't be afraid. -What a woman.

988
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,140
晚上好  比尔
Good evening, Bill.

989
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,340
她不会有事的
She'll be all right.

990
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:57,240
-还记得吗?  -当然
-Remember this? - Of course.

991
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:11,040
不穿披肩你会更惬意  爱华亭小姐
You may feel more comfortable without that garment, Miss Everdeane.

992
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,540
你得给我偷件新的来  比尔
You'll have to filch me a new one, Bill.

993
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:31,340
你口袋里有东西吗?
Anything in your pockets tonight?

994
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,940
我还没开始工作呢
Oh, I ain't started working yet.

995
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:39,940
我送你的那个小金盒呢?
What about that locket that I gave you?

996
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:58,540
我道歉  亲爱的  捡起来吧
Apologies, my dear. Pick it up.

997
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,440
可怜的小美人
Whoopsie-daisy!

998
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,840
这东西被我给毁了
Now it's good and broke.

999
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,440
今晚状态真不好
I can't seem to get anything right tonight.

1000
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:24,840
你够胆再来个压轴表演吗?
You got the sand to give them a grand finale?

1001
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,340
你的准头好一点还差不多
Maybe when you're aiming a little straighter.

1002
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:48,440
还是让你见血了  珍  这破音乐听够了
Still got some blood in you, Jen? Enough of this heathen music!

1003
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:51,940
把那帮该死的猴子赶走  开始演奏  伙计们
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys. Strike up, boys!

1004
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:57,440
准备?  这是美国之夜
Ready? This is a night for Americans!

1005
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:07,040
-珍妮  -把你的手拿开
-Jenny! -Get your hands off me.

1006
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:10,340
-快走  -把你的手拿开
-Go away. -Get your hands off me!

1007
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,640
走
Move.

1008
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,940
阿姆斯特丹!
Amsterdam!

1009
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:04,240
脱帽
Hats off!

1010
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:15,440
我们在心中永远怀念那些死去的弟兄们
We hold in our hearts the memory of our fallen brothers...

1011
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,240
他们的鲜血留在我们每天走过的街道上
...whose blood stains the very streets we walk today.

1012
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:26,440
同时我们在今晚  也追悼我们的敌人的首领
Also on this night, we pay tribute to the leader of our enemies...

1013
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:33,140
一位可敬之人  慷慨赴死
...an honorable man who crossed over bravely...

1014
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:36,040
...为他的信仰而战
...fighting for what he believed in.

1015
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:46,840
为了打败敌人我只能结束了他的生命
To defeat my enemy, I extinguish his life...

1016
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:51,040
...正如我毁灭这杯中的火焰一般
...and consume him as I consume these flames.

1017
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,740
向牧师瓦伦致敬
In honor of Priest Vallon.

1018
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,840
那里是弱点
That's a wound.

1019
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,540
天啊
God!

1020
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:19,140
我向大家介绍牧师瓦伦的儿子
I want you all to meet the son of Priest Vallon.

1021
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:22,040
我对他关怀倍至
I took him under my wing...

1022
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:23,940
看看现在他怎么报答我的
...and see how I'm repaid?

1023
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:26,340
-这个畜生  -先救我一命
-You bastard! -Saves my life one day...

1024
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:29,040
为的是他日象小贼一样图谋我的性命
...so he can kill me the next like a sneak-thief...

1025
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:32,240
...而不是象男子汉一样地公平决斗
...instead of fighting like a man.

1026
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:36,840
这种行为卑鄙地玷污了你高尚的父亲
A base defiler, unworthy of a noble name.

1027
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,740
天啊
God! Jesus!

1028
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:53,240
好了  麦格罗恩  把他抬上桌
All right, that'l do, McGloin. Splay him out.

1029
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:59,040
黑人不许看  你  你想偷窥
This show ain't for blackies. You! You get to watch.

1030
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:03,340
听见吗?  黑鬼!
Don't you hear, nigger?

1031
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:08,540
这可是鲜肉  知道我什么意思吗?
This is fresh meat. You know what I mean?

1032
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:11,940
我们得先把肉软化一下
We need to tenderize this meat a little bit.

1033
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:16,040
好吧  现在吻别这张年轻英俊的脸吧
All right, let's kiss good night to that pretty young face of yours.

1034
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:21,940
不
No!

1035
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,340
不
No!

1036
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:33,340
大家想要什么?  肋排还是里脊  腰还是小腿?
What'l it be, then? Rib or chop? Loin or shank?

1037
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,540
-肝  -脾
-The liver! -The spleen!

1038
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,440
-舌头  -肾
-The tongue! -Kidneys!

1039
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,940
-肺  -肝
- The lungs! - The liver!

1040
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:47,940
-舌头  -肾
-The tongue! -The kidneys!

1041
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,340
-胃  -心  心
-The stomach! -The heart! The heart!

1042
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:53,040
心?  这小子没有心
The heart? This boy has no heart.

1043
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,940
-宰了他  -宰了他
-Then kill him! -Kill him!

1044
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:05,840
他不配死  他不配死在我手里
He ain't earned a death. He ain't earned a death at my hands.

1045
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:10,640
不配  他将被打上耻辱的烙印出入人群
No. He'll walk amongst you marked with shame...

1046
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:16,140
...成为巴南姆博物馆的怪物
...a freak worthy of Barnum's Muzeum of Wonders.

1047
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:19,840
屠夫手下唯一放生的人
Go only man spared by the Butcher.

1048
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:21,440
不  比尔
No, Bill!

1049
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:25,640
不  不
No! No!

1050
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:29,440
不 不  不
No! No! No!

1051
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:33,040
不  不  不
No! No! No!

1052
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,730
这边  这边
Here. Here!

1053
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:04,330
走这边  快点  快点
This way. Come on. Come on!

1054
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:52,630
我想给你看点东西
I wanna show you something.

1055
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:00,630
我母亲的遗骨也埋在这里
My mother's bones share this grave.

1056
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:07,330
从13岁起我每赚一美元就存下10美分
I've saved 10 cents out of every dollar I've ever earned since I was 13.

1057
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:09,730
一共是215美元
That's $ 215.

1058
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:15,430
靠偷以及其他方式赚来的
That's $215 for bludgeting and the rest.

1059
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:22,830
我就想给你看这东西
This is what I wanted to show you.

1060
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:25,730
你身体好了我们就去这地方
This is where we're gonna go as soon as you get well.

1061
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:30,830
旧金山  加利福尼亚
San francisco, California.

1062
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:36,330
那里想要什么就有什么
You can have anything you want out there.

1063
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:42,130
这些人正在从河里淘金子只是用手
These men are pulling gold right out of the river with their own hands.

1064
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:48,430
我们在这里  需要到那去
We're here, and we need to get there.

1065
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:54,630
从这起程  沿海岸往南走
We start here, go down around here...

1066
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:59,530
再往北到旧金山
...to San francisco.

1067
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,030
最快的路
Shortest way to go.

1068
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,330
你愿和我一起去吧?
Would you go with me?

1069
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:34,730
没必要开枪  小姐  也没必要指着我
No need to fire that, miss. Or even aim it.

1070
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:38,530
我只是来探望你受伤的朋友而已
An audience with your mangled friend is all I want.

1071
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:56,130
我的棒上有44条刀痕
I got 44 notches in my club.

1072
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:00,430
知道是为什么吗?
Do you know what they're for?

1073
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:05,530
用于死的时候提醒我所欠上帝的债
To remind me of what I owe God when I die.

1074
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,330
我父亲也死在战斗中
My father was killed in battle too.

1075
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,930
在爱尔兰  在街头
In Ireland, in the streets...

1076
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:27,730
敌人是那些要把强行霸占别人十分之一所得作为特权的人物
...fighting those who would take as their privilege...what could only be got and held by the decimation of a race.

1077
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:31,830
这种战争已经有上千年历史了
That war is 1000 years old or more.

1078
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:35,430
我们希望不会把它带到美国
We never expected it to follow us here.

1079
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,430
可惜希望落空
It didn't.

1080
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:42,330
我们一落脚就发现它早已在这恭候多时了
It was waiting for us when we landed.

1081
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:50,230
你父亲想为他的同胞在这个国家找一块安生之地
Your father tried to carve out a corner in this country for his tribe.

1082
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:55,030
这就是他以及他的死兔帮的使命
That was him. That was his Dead Rabbits.

1083
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:01,430
我时常想如果他能长寿一些
I often wondered, if he'd lived a bit longer...

1084
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:05,030
会不会还有更多要求?
...would he have wanted a bit more?

1085
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:19,630
那他去世时你为何还要搜他的口袋?
Why'd you rifle through his pockets then?

1086
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,230
为了保管他的遗物
For safekeeping.

1087
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:44,530
也许你用得着它
I thought maybe you could do with it.

1088
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:09,130
血该留在刀刃上
The blood stays on the blade.

1089
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:28,030
这只可怜的兔子真是我见犹怜
That's a sorry-looking pelt.

1090
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:36,530
这三个月里来它一直健康乖巧的
And it's been so nice and quiet for the last three months.

1091
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:42,330
如此罪行你能泰然处之吗?
Tell me, this charge, does it sit uneasy with you?

1092
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:45,730
不行  其实我挺...
No, it's...

1093
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:49,130
不安的  比尔
...not uneasy, Bill.

1094
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,430
不行  我没法泰然处之
No, I wouldn't say that.

1095
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:59,430
可是我效忠于法律
But my allegiance is to the law.

1096
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:03,230
我们的职责就是维护法律
I'm paid to uphold the law.

1097
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:22,630
你到底在说什么呀?
What in heaven's name are you talking about?

1098
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:32,330
你可能有顾虑  别以为这样会被指责
You may have misgivings, but don't go believing that.That way lies damnation.

1099
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:38,630
我没有被指责的危险  比尔
I'm in no danger of damnation, Bill.

1100
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,030
你给我听着
Here's the thing.

1101
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:56,130
我对你那些道义上的困惑没丁点兴趣
I don't give a tuppenny fuck about your moral conundrum...

1102
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:59,230
你这个猪脑袋
...you meatheaded shit-sack.

1103
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,330
面前就是这样一件事
That's more or less the thing.

1104
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,830
我要你亲自去办  就是你
And I want you to go out there... You, nobody else.

1105
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:12,330
不要别人你手下的奴才别插手
None of your little minions. I want you to go out there...

1106
01:56:12,730 --> 01:56:14,730
我要你亲自去
...and I want you...

1107
01:56:15,730 --> 01:56:19,530
我要你去惩治...
...to punish the person...

1108
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:22,230
那个家伙...
...who's responsible...

1109
01:56:24,430 --> 01:56:29,030
那个杀害了这只可怜的兔子的家伙
...for murdering this poor little rabbit.

1110
01:56:35,230 --> 01:56:37,230
你明白了吗?
Is that understood?

1111
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:42,830
是的
Right.

1112
01:56:44,230 --> 01:56:47,630
走之前先尝几口鲜肉吧
Help yourself to some decent meat on the way out.

1113
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:26,630
该死
Damn it.

1114
01:57:28,430 --> 01:57:30,430
是你吗?
Is that you, boy?

1115
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:33,930
我开枪其实没其他意思
I didn't mean nothing by that shot, you know.

1116
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:38,230
只是你吓了我一跳
You scared me is all.

1117
01:57:40,530 --> 01:57:43,230
你该知道我绝对不会伤害你的
Sure you know I'd never do you harm.

1118
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:46,530
出来吧  小伙子
Come out now, lad.

1119
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:51,530
还记得你父亲和我吗?
Remember your father and me.

1120
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:58,330
当时你是不是太小了?把杰克叔叔给忘了?
Are you too young to remember your old Uncle Jack?

1121
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:02,930
时间过得真快
Oh, the times we had.

1122
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:10,830
你知道我不会伤害你的
You know I won't hurt you.

1123
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:34,530
他死了吗?
Is he dead?

1124
01:58:34,830 --> 01:58:38,130
我去叫安德鲁  安德鲁  过来看
I'm gonna get Andrew. Andrew, come see.

1125
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:42,530
安德鲁  过来看  快  都快点
Andrew, come see, quick! Everybody, quick!

1126
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:47,330
搞得人人自危  下一位该到哪位政客了?
This is bad for everybody. What's next? Dead politicians?

1127
01:58:48,530 --> 01:58:53,430
对我来说  你们6条命没他一条命值钱
I could spare half a dozen of you easier than I can spare him.

1128
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:57,930
这小子挺有干劲
Still, I think it shows dash.

1129
01:58:58,330 --> 01:59:02,130
给这小子多一点时间  我们会和他算总帐的
Give the boy some time. We'll settle with a good dustup.

1130
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:49,030
每天有好多同胞从船上下来
There's more of us coming off these ships every day.

1131
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:53,430
听说每周有15000爱尔兰人到来
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.

1132
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:56,930
可我们为什么还是怕本地帮?
And we're afraid of the Natives.

1133
01:59:59,030 --> 02:00:03,330
如果我们团结起来那就不止是个帮派  简直是只军队
Get all of us together, we ain't got a gang. We got an army.

1134
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:06,130
我们需要一颗火种  对吧?  一颗火种
And all you neet a spark, right? Just one spark.

1135
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:08,930
星星之火  可以燎原
Something to wake us all up.

1136
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:28,130
出卖你的人是我
It was me played you false.

1137
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:33,530
-我后悔刚才说了那话  -后悔?
-I'd take it back if I could. -Take it back?

1138
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,730
约翰尼  我要杀了你
Johnny, I gotta kill you.

1139
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:56,730
滚出五点区  别再回来
Get out of the Points and don't come back.

1140
02:01:04,330 --> 02:01:06,630
你去哪  小伙子?
Where you going, boyo?

1141
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:09,230
跟我来
Come along.

1142
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:11,130
跟我来
Come on.

1143
02:01:13,730 --> 02:01:16,530
告诉我们  你惹了什么麻烦?
Tell us, John, what's the trouble?

1144
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:19,230
没麻烦  比尔
No trouble, Bill.

1145
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:24,830
还在为你的那些朋友保密?
Still hiding out with your friends?

1146
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:32,530
不是  我和他们不是一路的  比尔
No, I'm... I'm not with them, Bill.

1147
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:35,930
我和你是一路的  和本地帮是一路的
I'm with you. I'm with the Natives.

1148
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:44,630
据我所知  你一直都是本地帮的...
You always was a Native as far as I'm interested, John...

1149
02:01:47,230 --> 02:01:50,030
...直到你成为叛徒之前
...till you became a stag.

1150
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:57,030
你说你是本地帮的  你知道本地帮的人是什么样的吗?
You tell me you're a Native. Do you want to know what a Native is?

1151
02:01:59,030 --> 02:02:02,430
本地帮的好汉
A Native is a man...

1152
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:07,230
...为了国家不惜流血牺牲
...what's willing to give his life for his country...

1153
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:11,530
...就象我父亲那样
...like my father done.

1154
02:02:14,730 --> 02:02:18,530
你愿意这么做吗?小朋友?
Are you willing to do that, my young friend?

1155
02:02:27,730 --> 02:02:30,830
约翰  约翰尼!
John. Johnny!

1156
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:40,330
约翰尼?
Johnny?

1157
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:51,730
约翰
John...

1158
02:03:04,030 --> 02:03:06,730
我伤得很重
It hurts too much.

1159
02:03:12,930 --> 02:03:15,030
杀了我吧
Just kill me.

1160
02:03:19,730 --> 02:03:22,030
杀了我吧
Just kill me.

1161
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,830
求你了  求你了
Please, please.

1162
02:03:34,530 --> 02:03:36,430
求你了
Please.

1163
02:03:38,830 --> 02:03:40,630
求你了
Please.

1164
02:03:44,830 --> 02:03:47,230
对不起  约翰尼
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1165
02:04:02,830 --> 02:04:05,130
天主圣母玛利亚
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners...

1166
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:08,730
求您现在和在我们临终时为我们罪人祈求天主  阿门
...now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1167
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:11,730
安息吧  妈妈
Rest in peace, Ma.

1168
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:16,930
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here, boyo?

1169
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:26,530
这黑鬼上教堂干什么?
What's a nigger doing in this church?

1170
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:33,030
死兔帮应该怎么对付本地帮?
What's a Dead Rabbit doing with the Natives?

1171
02:04:33,330 --> 02:04:36,330
本地帮没有黑鬼  本地帮和死兔帮信仰相同
There's no niggers in the Natives. Natives and Rabbits is one thing.

1172
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:38,530
可是黑鬼跑到教堂里来却是另一码事
A nigger in the church is something else!

1173
02:04:38,830 --> 02:04:40,630
你投靠了本地帮你去为本地帮祈祷吧
You run with the Natives, pray with them!

1174
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:43,830
你们会象你们的人一样被穿在桩子上
You're gonna wind up on a stake like your man did!

1175
02:04:44,830 --> 02:04:46,030
麦格罗恩
McGloin.

1176
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:50,430
神父  天啊  你知道有个黑鬼跑到你的教堂里来了吗?
Father! Jesus, did you know there's a nigger in your church?

1177
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:11,130
天啊
Jesus.

1178
02:05:33,730 --> 02:05:36,130
天翻地覆了
The earth turns...

1179
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:39,630
...可我们并未觉察到
...but we don 't feel it move.

1180
02:05:42,330 --> 02:05:45,030
直到某天晚上才突然发现
Then one night you look up.

1181
02:05:46,230 --> 02:05:51,130
星星之火  终于燎原
One spark, and the sky is on fire.

1182
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:05,430
真是令人激动的场面
It's a touching spectacle.

1183
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:10,230
你们准备好了我们会回来的
We'll come back when you're ready for us.

1184
02:06:16,630 --> 02:06:20,230
过去就是我们的指路明灯
The past is the torch that lights our way.

1185
02:06:20,730 --> 02:06:25,930
先辈们已经指引了我们该走的路  我们应该大步前行
Where our fathers have shown us the path, we shall follow.

1186
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:32,130
我们的信仰是敌人最惧怕的武器
Our faith is the weapon most feared by our enemies.

1187
02:06:32,530 --> 02:06:37,230
凭藉信仰我们可以发动同胞对抗欲置我们于死地的敌人
For thereby shall we lift our people up against those who would destroy us.

1188
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:42,330
我们称自己为'死兔帮'  为了牢记我们过去经受的苦难
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits to remind all of our suffering...

1189
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:46,430
为了团结正在经受苦难的人们
...and as a call to those who suffer still to join our ranks...

1190
02:06:46,830 --> 02:06:51,430
...团结那些从我们共同的家乡  漂洋过海  不远万里来到此地的人们
...however so far they may have strayed from our common home across the sea.

1191
02:06:51,730 --> 02:06:59,230
因为众人同心  其利断金
For with great numbers must come great strength...and the salvation of our people.

1192
02:06:59,830 --> 02:07:02,130
-你们那些事我们不想掺乎进来  -有多少人住在这里?
-We don't want your business. -How many men live here?

1193
02:07:02,330 --> 02:07:04,830
-都得来登记  -你们不能强迫我入伍
-You have to register. -You can't force me to join.

1194
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:06,630
-你有300美元吗?  -当然没有
-Have you got $300? - Of course not.

1195
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:10,230
哪他妈的去搞300美元?  如果你被征召  想要免服兵役
-Who's got $300? -Lf you're drafted, release from service...

1196
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:13,830
需要缴纳300美元才行  这是征兵法规定的
...can only be secured for $300, according to the Conscription Act.

1197
02:07:14,130 --> 02:07:16,630
-否则  你就得入伍  -谁他妈有300美元?
-Otherwise, you have to serve! -Who the hell's got $300?

1198
02:07:16,930 --> 02:07:20,430
你必须应征    除非你有300美元
You have to serve, sir, unless you have $300!

1199
02:07:20,830 --> 02:07:22,730
-伙计们  -从哪来滚回哪去
-Boys! - Go back to where you came from!

1200
02:07:22,930 --> 02:07:27,130
我在此土生土长  你是移民到此你就必须为这个国家战斗
I'm born in this country. You immigrated here. You will fight for this country!

1201
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:29,930
天啊  战争真是可怕的灾难
Sweet Jesus! War does terrible things to men.

1202
02:07:30,330 --> 02:07:36,130
-滚回富人区去  -300美元?  -又一场富人的战争
-Get back uptown where you belong! -$300? So it's another rich man's war.

1203
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:39,430
先生  我想和此人谈谈
Sir, I request an audience with this man.

1204
02:07:41,630 --> 02:07:43,630
纽约已经没人说英语了吗?
No one speak English in New York anymore?

1205
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:46,030
-我不懂你说什么  -原来你会说英语
-Don't understand. -You do speak English.

1206
02:07:48,030 --> 02:07:52,230
爱华亭小姐能否别把枪口这么对着我?
I wonder if Miss Everdeane could angle her rifle in some other direction.

1207
02:07:57,830 --> 02:08:02,330
瓦伦先生  不知道你是否明白这份宣传的真正价值
I wonder, Mr. Vallon, if you understand the true value of this sort of publicity.

1208
02:08:06,430 --> 02:08:10,230
大教主本人与五点区的半数爱尔兰人立场一致
The archbishop himself, shoulder to shoulder with the Irish in the Five Points.

1209
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:13,930
我愿意与你们结盟对抗比尔.卡丁...
I'm offering to form an alliance with you against Bill Cutting...

1210
02:08:14,330 --> 02:08:16,930
...及他支持的持本土论观点的候选人
...and his slate of Nativist candidates.

1211
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:21,030
我愿意出个很好的价钱给每位投票给坦慕尼的爱尔兰人
I'll negotiate a handsome fee for every Irish vote you send Tammany's way...

1212
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:23,630
在接下来的选举中
...in the coming elections.

1213
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:28,130
我需要在五点区物色一位新盟友
I need a new friend in the Five Points, son.

1214
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:33,730
我希望这位朋友是你
I'd like that friend to be you.

1215
02:08:37,030 --> 02:08:39,630
等一下  特威德先生
Now, just a moment, Mr. Tweed.

1216
02:08:39,930 --> 02:08:42,930
如果你能拿到你希望的选票
Suppose we do get you those votes.

1217
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:47,530
你能不能支持我选择的一位爱尔兰候选人?
Would you back an Irish candidate of my choosing?

1218
02:08:47,830 --> 02:08:50,730
-恐怕不行  -如果所有爱尔兰人都投你的票呢?
-I don't think so. -What if we get you all the Irish votes?

1219
02:08:51,230 --> 02:08:54,730
瓦伦先生  这简直是天方夜谭
That will only happen in the reign of Queen Dick.

1220
02:08:56,830 --> 02:08:59,030
-你说什么?  -就是永远不可能发生的事
-Beg your pardon? -It will never happen.

1221
02:08:59,230 --> 02:09:02,530
我倒是可以支持爱尔兰人竞选市议员
I might be persuaded to back an Irish candidate for, say, alderman.

1222
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:05,630
-市议员?  爱尔兰人已经有了市议员了
-Alderman? -We've already got Irish aldermen.

1223
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:09,130
-正因为如此  -所以 比市议员大的是什么?
-So we have. That's why... -Well, what's bigger than alderman?

1224
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:14,330
治安官  治安官  好了  特威德先生
Sheriff. Sheriff. All right, Mr. Tweed.

1225
02:09:14,630 --> 02:09:18,430
你支持一位爱尔兰人竞选纽约市或县的治安官
You back an Irishman for sheriff of the city and county of New York...

1226
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:20,130
...我们会让他当选
...and we'll get him elected.

1227
02:09:20,330 --> 02:09:23,530
我爱你们爱尔兰人  孩子  可高于市议员的职位你们永远不可能得到
I love the Irish, but higher than alderman you shall never climb.

1228
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:26,230
-为什么呢?  -首先  没一个人
-Well, why not? -For one thing, no man living...

1229
02:09:26,530 --> 02:09:28,230
...能决定所有爱尔兰人的投票方向  -我能
...can consolidate the Irish vote. - I can.

1230
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:30,630
其次  此话不怀恶意
And for another, I mean no effrontery...

1231
02:09:30,830 --> 02:09:34,930
...找不出一位爱尔兰人适合竞选治安官
...no one's yet found an Irish candidate for sheriff worth voting for.

1232
02:09:37,530 --> 02:09:38,830
蒙克
Monk.

1233
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:41,230
请看
Here.

1234
02:09:45,730 --> 02:09:48,330
看起来象我祖父一样镇定从容
He's to have me looking as sober as me own grandfather.

1235
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:52,530
-他肯定很了不起  -他是个烂酒鬼
-Another great man, I'm sure. -A thorough drunken bastard.

1236
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:56,530
我愿意试一试
Could I say what I want?

1237
02:09:57,730 --> 02:09:59,930
正是我想要的
Well, that's why I wanted you.

1238
02:10:00,230 --> 02:10:03,030
我们选的代表们是一伙盗匪
Our elected representatives are a gang of thieves...

1239
02:10:03,330 --> 02:10:04,930
...赌咒发誓要为我们谋取更好的权益的同时
...who swear to better our lot...

1240
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:08,030
...手却伸到我们的腰包里去了
...while dipping their hands deep into our pockets.

1241
02:10:08,230 --> 02:10:11,830
我与社区领袖们并肩作战比如这位比尔.卡丁先生
I stand shoulder to shoulder with community leaders like Bill Cutting...

1242
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:16,130
对抗所有敢于侵害民主的人
...against any and all inroads into our fine democracy.

1243
02:10:16,530 --> 02:10:20,530
我要确保没人能夺走你们千辛万苦得来的东西
I'll see to it that no one takes away what you've earned by pluck and application.

1244
02:10:20,930 --> 02:10:22,830
-入侵的爱尔兰蛮子
-To invading hordes of Hibernians!

1245
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:26,930
去把票投给沃尔特麦克金
You go to the polls and you put your mark next to the name Walter McGinn.

1246
02:10:27,330 --> 02:10:31,730
-打倒那帮吃土豆的人比如那边那堆人  他们抢走了我们的饭碗
-Against the potato eaters, like them over there, thieving our jobs!

1247
02:10:32,130 --> 02:10:34,430
为什么这么多爱尔兰人要到南方去送死?
Why should so many Irish die down south...

1248
02:10:34,630 --> 02:10:39,130
...我们的战场不是在南方各州  而是在这里的大街小巷里
...when the first war to win is not down in Dixie, but right here in these streets?

1249
02:10:41,130 --> 02:10:43,830
谁是五点区最好的斗士?
And who's the finest street fighter in the Five Points?

1250
02:10:44,130 --> 02:10:46,230
-蒙克  -没错
-Monk! - That's right.

1251
02:10:46,530 --> 02:10:49,130
那么让全城都听到你们的声音
Now, let the whole damn city hear it!

1252
02:10:50,730 --> 02:10:52,430
这人天生就是干这个的
That man was right born for this.

1253
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:55,630
他杀过44人  打败的更有百人之多
Well, he's killed 44 men, laid low a couple hundred more.

1254
02:10:55,930 --> 02:10:57,430
-是真的吗?  -真的
-Is that right? -That's right.

1255
02:10:57,730 --> 02:10:59,730
我应该让他竞选市长
I should have run him for mayor.

1256
02:11:01,930 --> 02:11:05,130
好了  把他们全带走  今天是选举日
All right, line them up. It's election day!

1257
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:09,030
快点  你这畜生
Not so fast, you little yellow bastard!

1258
02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:11,030
起来
Come on!

1259
02:11:14,930 --> 02:11:16,830
起来  畜生  给我投票去
Come on, you bastard, we need your vote.

1260
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:20,430
畜生?我过去为你们而战  黑鬼
Bastard? I fought for you, nigger. I lost an arm for you.

1261
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:22,430
还没算完  马上跟我走
Well, that's a start. Now, come on.

1262
02:11:22,630 --> 02:11:24,330
太阳出来了  太阳出来了
Rise and shine. Rise and shine.

1263
02:11:24,630 --> 02:11:27,630
我们这个伟大的国家里牛鬼蛇神也能投票
In this great country of ours, even the hop fiends get to vote!

1264
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:30,730
别打扮了  加快动作
Less art and more haste, Don.

1265
02:11:31,030 --> 02:11:33,430
-你去哪?  -我今天已经投了票
-Where are you going? - I already voted today.

1266
02:11:33,630 --> 02:11:36,530
投给了蒙克和坦慕尼  各两次
Cast for Monk and Tammany, by God. Twice.

1267
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:40,630
两次?  才两次?  你就是这样行使公民权利的吗?  跟我来
Twice? Only twice? You call that doing your civic duty? Come with me.

1268
02:11:40,830 --> 02:11:43,330
你别走  回来坐下
Oh, no, you don't. Get back and sit down.

1269
02:11:43,630 --> 02:11:45,630
又一个  好好给他清理一下
Here's another one. Clean him up good.

1270
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:48,430
把他们的胡子剃了  让他们再去投一次
Shave their beards and send them back to vote again.

1271
02:11:48,830 --> 02:11:51,530
好的  伙计们  投蒙克和坦慕尼  蒙克和坦慕尼
All right, boys. Vote Monk, Tammany. Monk, Tammany!

1272
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:54,830
先生们  我们伟大的城市需要一座新法院
So, gentlemen, what our great city needs is a new courthouse.

1273
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:57,830
我希望未来的法院应该比较经济节约
I propose it should be a modest, economical structure.

1274
02:11:58,030 --> 02:11:59,830
失陪一会  什么事?
Excuse me one moment.

1275
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:03,430
蒙克已经比其他对手领先3000多票了
Monk's already won by 3000 more votes than there are voters.

1276
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:07,230
这么少?  设法提高到2、3万去  我们不要小胜  我们要大捷
Three? Make it 20, 30. We don't need a victory. We need a Roman triumph!

1277
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:11,530
-我们没有多余的选票了  -记住从政的首要准则
-But we don't have any more ballots. -Remember the first rule of politics:

1278
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:15,130
选票不代表最后结果  最后的计票才代表结果  是计票
The ballots don't make the results, the counters make the results.

1279
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:16,430
继续计吧
Keep counting.

1280
02:12:48,430 --> 02:12:50,330
比尔送来的
It's from Bill.

1281
02:12:53,830 --> 02:12:55,330
蒙克
Monk.

1282
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:18,030
五点区的公民们...
Citizens of the Five Points...

1283
02:13:18,630 --> 02:13:22,430
比尔.卡丁先生试图挑起纷争
...Mr. Bill Cutting is attempting to draw me into an argument...

1284
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:27,130
最终无疑会引发流血事件进而危及我的办公室的安全
...that would no doubt end in bloodshed and the compromising of my office.

So because you are lukewarm, I will spew you out of my mouth.

1306

你自己营造你的肮脏世界去吧
You can build your filthy world without me.

1307
