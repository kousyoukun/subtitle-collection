1
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:56,215
No,son. Never.

2
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:59,005
The blood stays on the blade.

3
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,225
One day you'll understand.

4
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:15,485
Some of it I half remember.

5
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:18,065
And the rest...

6
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:21,365
The rest I took from dreams.

7
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:28,415
St. Michael,the archangel, defend us in battle.

8
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:33,165
Be our protector against the snares...

9
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:36,925
...and the wickedness of the devil.

10
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:38,885
Now,son,who's that?

11
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:40,845
- St. Michael. - Who is it?

12
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:42,925
- St. Michael! - And what did he do?

13
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:45,885
He cast Satan out of paradise.

14
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:48,225
Good boy.

15
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:01,385
May God put the steel of the Holy Spirit in your spine...

16
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:04,425
...and the love of the Blessed Virgin in your heart.

17
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:33,915
- Hey,boyo! - Johnny.

18
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:37,005
- What's the battle? - Natives against the Dead Rabbits.

19
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:40,795
- Which are you? - What do you think? Dead Rabbits.

20
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,335
Well,well,Monk.

21
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:25,545
Are you with us or not?

22
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,965
For the last time,Vallon, I'm with you if the money is right.

23
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:32,885
I'll give you 10 per notch.

24
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:36,765
- Ten? - You have my word.

25
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:44,775
- Ten per notch? - Per new notch.

26
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:50,245
Then I'm your man.

27
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:41,975
Is this it,Priest? The pope's new army?

28
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:45,525
A few crusty bitches and a handful of ragtags?

29
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:49,235
Now,now,Bill,you swore this was a battle between warriors...

30
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:51,735
...not a bunch of Miss Nancys.

31
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:54,735
So warriors is what I brought.

32
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:59,035
The O'Connell Guard.

33
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:00,745
The Plug Uglies.

34
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,375
The Shirt Tails.

35
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:09,925
The Chichesters.

36
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:12,885
The Forty Thieves.

37
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,735
On my challenge...

38
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:37,695
...by the ancient laws of combat, we have met at this chosen ground...

39
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:40,285
...to settle,for good and all...

40
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:44,415
...who holds sway over the Five Points:

41
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:50,465
Us Natives,born right-wise to this fine land...

42
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,425
...or the foreign hordes defiling it.

43
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:03,185
By the ancient laws of combat,I accept the challenge of the so-called Natives.

44
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:05,765
You plague our people at every turn.

45
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,775
But from this day out, you shall plague us no more.

46
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:12,735
For let it be known that the hand that tries to strike us from this land...

47
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:14,615
...shall be swiftly cut down.

48
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:20,285
Then may the Christian Lord guide my hand...

49
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:22,705
...against your Roman popery!

50
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:25,665
Prepare to receive the true Lord!

51
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:30,625
Priest!

52
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,085
Look to me.

53
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:25,465
Who is this under my knife?

54
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,975
Father,get up. Get up!

55
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:39,775
Where are you? Where are you?

56
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:42,615
Oh,my son.

57
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:49,615
Don't never look away.

58
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:59,465
Soon be over,Priest.

59
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,465
Finish it.

60
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:24,405
You may need this across the river.

61
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:36,705
Ears and noses will be the trophies of the day.

62
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:41,425
But no hand shall touch him!

63
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:46,345
No hand shall touch him!

64
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:51,015
He'll cross over whole...

65
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:53,725
...in honor.

66
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:56,605
Not before I get what's owed.

67
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:05,195
No!

68
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:10,785
It's fair. A touch indelicate,but fair.

69
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,375
My sympathies.

70
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:19,915
What will we do with the boy?

71
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:22,545
Look at me.

72
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:29,885
Give him to the law.

73
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:32,765
See he gets a good education.

74
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:36,435
Okay,boy,say goodbye to your father.

75
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:45,695
- Get him! - Get him!

76
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,065
Don't let him get away.

77
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:50,735
Hurry,come in here!

78
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:54,575
He's going downstairs.

79
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:12,215
Come here,boy.

80
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,265
- You're going to Hellgate,son. - There he is. Get him.

81
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:18,475
- Priest Vallon died a noble death... - Let go of me!

82
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:24,065
...but his Dead Rabbits is done and outlawed!

83
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:30,905
Let no one even speak their name from this time on.

84
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:21,035
In this place,you have grown from a boy into a man.

85
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:26,625
Put to death the earthly things in you: Immorality,impurity...

86
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:29,375
...passion,vengeance.

87
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:32,885
The Lord has forgiven you.

88
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:36,385
You also must forgive.

89
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,845
You go forth to a country torn apart by civil strife.

90
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:44,225
Thank you,Reverend.

91
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:50,065
Lend your hand to the work that yet remains...

92
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,485
...that this war may end...

93
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:56,035
...and the plague of slavery that brought this conflagration...

94
00:15:56,195 --> 00:16:01,575
...down upon us vanish forever from the earth.

95
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:34,155
In the second year of the Civil War...

96
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:36,905
...when the Irish Brigade marched in the streets...

97
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:40,075
...New York was a city full of tribes...

98
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:43,625
...war chiefs,rich and poor.

99
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:47,625
- Down with Lincoln! - Lincoln will make all white men slaves.

100
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,455
It wasn't a city really.

101
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:55,135
It was more a furnace where a city someday might be forged.

102
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,965
That's the spirit,boys.

103
00:16:57,135 --> 00:17:01,475
- Go off and die for your blackie friends. - Down with the abolitionists!

104
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,805
We should've run a better man against Lincoln when we had the chance.

105
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:06,855
New York should secede from the Union!

106
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,775
They trying to say we're no different than niggers?

107
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:12,815
You ain't. Good evening,brother.

108
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:15,275
- Praise the Union. - The Union forever!

109
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,285
Go back to Africa,nigger!

110
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:21,655
- Go back to Africa! - Leave him alone. We're free.

111
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,955
The angriest talk was of the new Conscription Act...

112
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,955
...the first draft in Union history.

113
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:43,725
Join the Army,lads. Three square meals a day and good pay in your pocket.

114
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:47,305
When the Irish came, the city was in a fever.

115
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:52,065
Since the time of the great famine, they'd come streaming off the boats.

116
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:53,985
And they got a right warm welcome.

117
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:57,565
- Go back to Ireland,you dumb micks! - Remember that,you Irish gyps!

118
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:59,655
Get back on the boat,Paddy!

119
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:03,535
I only came two hours downriver from Hellgate.

120
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:06,075
But they all took me for an immigrant.

121
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:09,335
Why not? There were a thousand different accents in New York.

122
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:14,215
And to the Natives,you see, we was all the same.

123
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:22,845
Welcome to America,son. Your long,arduous journey is over.

124
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,435
- Go back to your own country! - Vote Tammany!

125
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:37,445
New York loved William Tweed and hated him.

126
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:41,865
And those of us trying to be thieves, well,we couldn't help but admire him.

127
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:45,535
Mr. Cutting,gentlemen, thank you for coming. It's an honor.

128
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:47,615
Mr. Tweed.

129
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,955
Sir,please. Excuse me.

130
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:54,545
- I think you're frightening them. - So?

131
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:58,425
Don't mind him. He used to be an Irishman.

132
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:01,635
Ah,the Five Points.

133
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:07,015
Murderers' Alley. Brickbat Mansion. The Gates of Hell.

134
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:13,065
Here in this vile place. Look upon the face of this poor child.

135
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:15,855
She lives in squalor...

136
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:20,405
...in this godforsaken den of vice and misery behind me.

137
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:23,285
Every year the reformers came.

138
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,155
Every year the Points got worse...

139
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:29,325
...as if it liked being dirty.

140
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:33,545
- Where am I going to go? - The Reverend wants you out of here.

141
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,915
You can't do this!

142
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:41,175
A glorious resurrection will spring from the filthy depths...

143
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:44,805
...to which these miserable creatures have fallen.

144
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:47,675
In God,they will find their true home.

145
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:51,475
You may or may not know,Bill, that every day I go to the waterfront...

146
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:54,265
...with hot soup for the Irish as they come ashore.

147
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,565
It's part of building a political base.

148
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:59,645
I've noticed you there. You may have noticed me.

149
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:03,065
Indeed I have. Throwing torrents of pavers and withering abuse...

150
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,825
...on everyone stepping off those boats. - Lf only I had the guns...

151
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:11,825
...l'd shoot each and every one of them before they set foot on American soil.

152
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,775
Mulberry Street...

153
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,275
...and Worth.

154
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:47,155
Cross and Orange and Little Water.

155
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:50,285
Each of the Five Points is a finger.

156
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:54,785
When I close my hand, it becomes a fist.

157
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:59,005
And any time that I wish, I can turn it against you.

158
00:20:59,205 --> 00:21:01,465
I know,but we're talking about different things.

159
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:05,045
I'm talking about civic duty, responsibilities we owe to the people.

160
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:08,135
Schools and hospitals, sewers and utilities.

161
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:10,635
Street construction, repairs and sweeping.

162
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:13,015
Business licenses,saloon licenses...

163
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:38,745
St. Michael,the archangel, defend us in battle.

164
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:42,755
Be our protector against the snares and the wickedness of the devil.

165
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,545
Street cars,ferries,rubbish disposal.

166
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:48,595
There's a power of money to be made in this city,Bill.

167
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:52,845
With your help,the people must be made to understand...

168
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:57,055
...that all these things are best kept within the Tammany family...

169
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,435
...which is why I'm proposing an alliance...

170
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:02,065
...between our two great organizations.

171
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:06,565
- You're talking about muscle work. - That too. Muscle to match our spirit.

172
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:10,735
- You own the crushers. Get them to do it. - The police? Oh,no. Jesus,no!

173
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:14,745
The appearance of the law must be upheld...

174
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:17,415
...especially while it's being broken.

175
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:32,305
Give me the strength for what I must do.

176
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:37,145
Who are you?

177
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:41,565
- Hey! - No!

178
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:44,985
I said,who are you? What are you doing here?

179
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:55,455
I just like it down here is all.

180
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,665
See what's in his pockets,Jimmy.

181
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:02,335
- Look,boys,I really don't want a fight. - Don't want a fight?

182
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:05,795
Don't worry,son, ain't gonna be much a fight.

183
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:14,885
Don't kill me.

184
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:24,895
Where'd you get that?

185
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:27,485
I told you I didn't want a fight!

186
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:30,315
Why not? Look how good you done.

187
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:42,495
- You're the Priest's son,aren't you? - You,get away from me,understand?

188
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:47,335
You don't remember me,do you? I's the one tried to help you.

189
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:52,095
- What? - I's the one tried to help you...

190
00:23:52,255 --> 00:23:54,595
...when the Natives took you.

191
00:23:58,185 --> 00:24:03,185
- Oh,that was you? - Yeah. I thought you was killed.

192
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:07,855
They just locked me up, you know that?

193
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:10,025
This long?

194
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:15,075
Well,I kept trying to escape,you know. They add on time for that.

195
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:18,705
So,what are you doing back here?

196
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:21,415
I guess I missed the place.

197
00:24:28,295 --> 00:24:30,045
Bowery Boys.

198
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:43,935
Get back here!

199
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:46,895
The Five Points,Paradise Square.

200
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:50,145
The streets here are always lively of an evening.

201
00:24:51,145 --> 00:24:52,855
Who are the gangs around now?

202
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,945
The Daybreak Boys and the Swamp Angels.

203
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,325
They work the river,looting ships.

204
00:24:57,485 --> 00:25:00,205
The Frog Hollows shanghai sailors by the Bloody Angle.

205
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,875
The Shirt Tails was rough, but they've become a bunch of dandies...

206
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,955
...lolling around Murderers' Alley, looking like Chinamen.

207
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,915
Hell-Cat Maggie,she tried to open her own grog shop.

208
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:12,715
She drunk her own liquor and got throwed on the street.

209
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,425
- Beautiful. - Now she's on the lay for anything.

210
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:18,095
The Plug Uglies are from deep in the old country.

211
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:20,555
Got their own language no one understands.

212
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:24,095
They love to fight the cops. The Night Walkers of Ragpicker's Row.

213
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:27,225
They work on their backs and kill with their hands.

214
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:31,105
They're so scurvy only the Plug Uglies talk to them. But who understands them?

215
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:33,815
The Slaughter Housers and the Broadway Twisters.

216
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:37,155
They're a fine bunch of bingo boys. And the Little Forty Thieves.

217
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:38,735
I used to run with them...

218
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:41,825
...till they got took over by Bendrick the Cockroach.

219
00:25:41,995 --> 00:25:43,455
Bendrick carries a germ.

220
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:46,585
If you try to leave the gang, he hacks up blood on you.

221
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:50,125
The lime-juicers are nothing but a bunch of rapacious grab-ups.

222
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:53,175
The True Blue Americans say they're a gang...

223
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:56,135
...but all they do is stand on corners damning England.

224
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:59,595
If you believe one word the British say,you're a fool.

225
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:03,095
Do any of them got the sand of the Dead Rabbits?

226
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:08,855
You don't say that name.

227
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:13,695
That name died with your... They been outlawed.

228
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:16,195
In the blockhouse, the Chinks told me...

229
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:20,735
...that the Natives celebrate their victory every year. Is that true?

230
00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:23,785
Aye,that they do. It's quite the affair.

231
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:26,825
The Butcher himself's got to invite you, or you don't go.

232
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:40,345
Look where you're going,Johnny.

233
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:45,885
You look stunned and poorly,sir.

234
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:53,395
Quite a pair of conversationists, aren't you?

235
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:59,235
Maybe not,but we're deep thinkers.

236
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:08,745
Well,gentlemen,I leave you in the grace and favor of the Lord.

237
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,545
Jenny,the finest bludget in all the Points.

238
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:21,295
She is a prim-looking stargazer.

239
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:26,265
But I'd check my pockets if I was you...

240
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:29,725
...because I do believe she lifted your timepiece.

241
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,105
Well,I let her take it.

242
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:39,065
I let her take things all the time.

243
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:42,115
- Is that right? - Yeah.

244
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:49,075
We always liked a good fire in the Points.

245
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:55,955
You could pick up a little swag. And if the cops came,you really got a show.

246
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:59,585
The Municipal Police fought the Metropolitan Police.

247
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:02,505
The Metropolitan Police, they fought the street gangs.

248
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:05,095
Hurry up,men, before the Black Joke get there!

249
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:08,975
There were 37 amateur fire brigades, and they all fought each other.

250
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:15,105
The Black Joke are on their way,Tweed, and they'll beat the shite out of you.

251
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:23,365
Okay,boys,get the hose out!

252
00:28:28,535 --> 00:28:31,115
It's the Black Joke!

253
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:33,705
Go get them,boys!

254
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:36,835
Give those Bowery Boys hell!

255
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:40,625
- Quick,before there's nothing left. - Go back to the Bowery,you bums!

256
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:43,635
Stop them. For God's sake, they're taking everything!

257
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:46,555
In your next time of trouble, call on Tammany first.

258
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:50,015
But it's not too late. You can still save my house.

259
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:52,395
Let's go.

260
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:56,065
I thought you said you was hungry.

261
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:02,985
Grab what you can,Johnny. Let's get out of here.

262
00:29:03,695 --> 00:29:06,575
May I point out that this building is burning to ashes?

263
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:11,075
May I point out this area is the province of my own Americus Fire Brigade...

264
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:14,705
...and that you lot belong only in the Bowery?

265
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,915
May I point out that you're outmanned, outmaneuvered...

266
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:21,165
...and,in a moment,outfought?

267
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,215
Am I?

268
00:29:29,055 --> 00:29:32,225
There's the Black Joke! Let's take them on the cobbles.

269
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:36,765
Go spill some claret,boys. Go on,Shorty,have a nice muss.

270
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:39,605
Clear the way for Bill the Butcher.

271
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:41,895
Okay,boys,to work.

272
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:46,775
What's the point? The fire's near burned anything of value inside.

273
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:50,245
Boys,forget that one. Next building over.

274
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:53,245
Mustn't let it spread. Take what you want from that one.

275
00:29:53,415 --> 00:29:54,455
What are you doing?

276
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:57,415
There's nothing wrong with this one. This is my house.

277
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:02,715
- Johnny! - Help!

278
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,385
- Johnny! - Help!

279
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:09,595
Help! Help!

280
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:15,345
Help!

281
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,485
Come on. Come on,Johnny,get up.

282
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:23,855
Leave that!

283
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:32,575
You two,out of the way!

284
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:52,135
His name's Amsterdam.

285
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,645
- How's the beak? - Ain't so bad.

286
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:01,935
You. You got anything, you give it up or you get out.

287
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:14,995
Is that it?

288
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:17,415
That's it.

289
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:22,165
Right. Here's the rake. Everything comes here. We fence it.

290
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,795
Johnny takes our tribute to the Natives, and we chop up the winnings...

291
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:29,465
...each to his equal portion, amongst the gang.

292
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:33,135
Does that meet with your approval,Hellgate?

293
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:34,975
My approval?

294
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:38,015
What's the matter,Jack Sprat? Can't think for yourself?

295
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:42,645
- I'll slit your fucking throat! - Hey,come on!

296
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:44,065
Hey!

297
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:51,575
You boys will settle with me before settling with each other.

298
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:57,705
I come for my due and proper.

299
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:18,845
Well,this ain't a bad haul.

300
00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:22,855
When folks start in to saying to where the country is going to hell...

301
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:26,025
...I always tell them, "You just look at all the hard work...

302
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:29,565
...our fine young lads is doing down in the Five Points."

303
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:33,825
Oh,yeah. Now this is just the thing for Mrs. Mulraney.

304
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,325
All right there,Happy Jack, leave us something...

305
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:38,865
...to quarter to Bill the Butcher,eh?

306
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:40,575
Would you?

307
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:54,755
Not my favorite tune.

308
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:04,225
Thank you,boys.

309
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:07,725
You keep out of trouble now.

310
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:29,915
Every year the Natives celebrated the killing of my father all over again...

311
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:36,675
...at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda in Mott Street.

312
00:33:36,845 --> 00:33:40,475
The Chinks hated the Natives worse than we did.

313
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:47,685
The drum rolls,and the Butcher drinks a glass of fire.

314
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:54,235
When you kill a king...

315
00:33:54,775 --> 00:33:57,735
...you don't stab him in the dark.

316
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:04,415
You kill him where the whole court can watch him die.

317
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,835
Hey,you got any timber?

318
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:23,935
As I walked down to Chatham Street A fair maid I did meet

319
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,475
She asked me to see her home She lived in Bleeker Street

320
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:31,735
To me a-weigh,you Santee My dear Annie

321
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:35,195
Oh,you New York girls Can't you dance the polka?

322
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:39,275
To me a-weigh,you Santee My dear Annie

323
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:42,995
Oh,you New York girls Can't you dance the polka?

324
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:46,495
When we got to Bleeker Street We stopped at 44

325
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:50,165
Her mother and her sister Dared to meet us at the door

326
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:04,675
- Hey,Maggie. Right ear or left ear? - Give us a drink,you idiot.

327
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:06,475
Help yourself.

328
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,515
- Final bets! - To health.

329
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:11,725
Place your bets. Betting closes in two minutes.

330
00:35:11,895 --> 00:35:13,235
Place your bets.

331
00:35:13,395 --> 00:35:17,525
Gentlemen,the match is due to commence.

332
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:21,235
The count to beat is 25 rodents in three minutes.

333
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:23,745
Towser against the vermin.

334
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,575
- Are the enumerators satisfied? - Fifty!

335
00:35:25,785 --> 00:35:27,865
- Yes! - Let them go!

336
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:44,885
- Where you going,boy? - I'm here to pay tribute to Bill.

337
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:47,475
Are you now? Give it to me. I'll give it to him.

338
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:50,435
No,thanks. I'll give it to him myself.

339
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:54,565
What do you want to keep, the money or your teeth?

340
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:56,395
John.

341
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:58,985
Welcome.

342
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:09,455
From me and me lads,sir.

343
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,425
Mate of yours? Where's he from?

344
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,295
Oh,he's not from here,sir.

345
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:26,725
You.

346
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:46,285
That's close enough.

347
00:36:57,295 --> 00:37:01,885
Your friend can't look me in the eye. That's not an admirable characteristic.

348
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:05,965
No one can look you in the eye,Bill. Not when you're playing cards.

349
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:28,195
This is whist. It's a gentleman's game. Make a gentleman's bet.

350
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:32,825
- I'm betting large,Bill. - That ain't large.

351
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:44,505
Please,don't make that noise again, Harvey.

352
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:50,345
I like a man who's willing to burn for his swag.

353
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:56,395
How do you fare on water? Come closer.

354
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,855
Close,John. I ain't gonna bite. Close.

355
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:07,235
There's a Portuguese ship lying low in the harbor,quarantined three weeks.

356
00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:09,615
Get there before the Daybreak Boys strip her...

357
00:38:09,785 --> 00:38:11,405
...maybe you and me will talk more.

358
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:14,165
- Consider it done,sir. - Good boy.

359
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:18,955
And you,whatever your name is... What is your name?

360
00:38:22,585 --> 00:38:29,005
- Amsterdam,sir. - Amsterdam. I'm New York.

361
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:31,725
Don't you never come in here empty-handed again.

362
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:35,265
You gotta pay for the pleasure of my company.

363
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:37,395
Take him for a boat ride,John.

364
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:40,685
Who knows,but he might save your life again.

365
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:47,065
The Daybreak Boys catch us, they'll slit our throats.

366
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:49,945
I'll do it myself in a minute if you don't keep quiet.

367
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:53,285
I never liked the harbor after dark.

368
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:56,875
And now each night they brung ashore the bodies of the soldiers.

369
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,915
Many mothers have not even the solace...

370
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,505
...of knowing where their sons have fallen.

371
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:04,375
I lost my own eldest at Antietam.

372
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:07,135
His mother and I were unable to recover his remains.

373
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:10,055
- It was a mournful sight. - The war can't last forever.

374
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,925
But we had business of our own.

375
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:26,605
The Daybreak Boys have been here, and there's nothing left. Let's go back.

376
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:32,785
What the hell?

377
00:39:39,665 --> 00:39:41,795
Jimmy,get down!

378
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:47,835
Jesus,that'll bring the harbor cops for sure. Fuck off.

379
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:57,635
Let's take a look.

380
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,725
Jesus,they killed everybody.

381
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:05,735
There's nothing here but a bunch of dead sea-crabs.

382
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:08,195
Come on,let's go.

383
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:12,195
- Shove off. - No,wait for Amsterdam.

384
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,575
Where's Amsterdam?

385
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:19,575
- No,you damn fool,take him! - What in the hell for?!

386
00:40:19,745 --> 00:40:21,835
Look in my glims. I said no less than 15.

387
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:25,375
- Is this fresh? - Four hours most.

388
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:28,335
Much obliged,gents.

389
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:37,515
What's that word?

390
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:40,725
- It means body snatchers. - I didn't ask the meaning.

391
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:42,265
I asked the word.

392
00:40:42,935 --> 00:40:44,395
Ghoul.

393
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:49,395
Ghoul? That's a good word.

394
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:55,865
"Ghoul Gang Slaughters. A Fresh Outrage in the Five Points."

395
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:58,535
- That's a notice you can be proud of. - Thank you.

396
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:02,455
A low thing,to do that to a body. Low.

397
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,915
Why? They could have left that ship with nothing.

398
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:09,255
Instead they made The Police Gazette, a periodical of note.

399
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:11,835
A body's supposed to stay beneath the earth...

400
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:15,175
...wearing a wooden coat until the Resurrection.

401
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:18,265
These two are a pair of sons of Irish bitches,same as you.

402
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:20,515
It don't seem to bother them none.

403
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:23,605
But then maybe they don't share your religious scruples.

404
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:26,565
Maybe they're just a couple of Fidlam Bens.

405
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:36,115
I've been called a lot of things,mister, but I ain't never been called...

406
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:39,995
- Fidlam Bens. - Fidlam Bens. Right.

407
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:46,545
Well,if I knew what in the hell that meant,I'd be inclined to take offense.

408
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:50,915
A Fidlam Bens is a fellow who steals anything,dead or alive...

409
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:54,175
...because he's too low to work up a decent lay for himself.

410
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:56,635
Count that careful,Bill. Count that careful.

411
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,845
- I'm telling you,that's all there is... - Now,chiseler...

412
00:42:00,015 --> 00:42:03,555
If you'd said "chiseler," now there's a word I understand. You know?

413
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:07,855
- Now,is that what you're calling us? - I can think of many things to call you.

414
00:42:08,015 --> 00:42:11,315
Right. But I asked if you was calling us chiselers.

415
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:14,235
Supposing I am?

416
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:18,865
Well,then we got business.

417
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:22,075
That we do.

418
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:31,835
- A fight! There's a fight! - Two bucks on McGloin.

419
00:42:32,005 --> 00:42:34,465
- Four bits on the kid. - Five bits on the kid.

420
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:37,465
I got two on Amsterdam.

421
00:42:45,975 --> 00:42:49,355
Come on,McGloin,he's just a kid.

422
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:52,525
Four bits to back Amsterdam.

423
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:02,155
Watch his left,McGloin. Watch his left.

424
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,865
- All right,that'll do. That'll do. - Anything to say now,huh?!

425
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:47,705
That'll do,for chrissake. Drag him off.

426
00:43:47,865 --> 00:43:51,035
- That's enough,kid. - You got him. Come on,kid,you won.

427
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:54,045
McGloin. He's a kid too,McGloin.

428
00:43:54,205 --> 00:43:56,795
You're getting too old for it,McGloin.

429
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:23,785
McGloin,how would that head look without the ears and the nose on it?

430
00:44:25,075 --> 00:44:27,455
You'd better leave that head alone,Bill.

431
00:44:27,615 --> 00:44:31,165
I think I'm gonna trim the ears and the beak off of that head.

432
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:34,665
Make a nice pot of soup of that head.

433
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:37,585
You could find a tastier head than that,Bill.

434
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:41,135
I ain't got the stomach for no Irish stew.

435
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:48,685
The mighty McGloin almost fishhooked by a sprat.

436
00:44:57,355 --> 00:45:01,485
On the seventh day,the Lord rested, but before that he did...

437
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:07,575
...he squatted over the side of England, and what came out of him was Ireland.

438
00:45:07,745 --> 00:45:11,745
- No offense,son. - Oh,none taken,sir. I grew up here.

439
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:16,455
All I ever knew of Ireland was in the talk of the others at the orphan asylum.

440
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:21,635
In which part of that excrementitious isle were your forebears spawned?

441
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:27,425
I've been told Kerry,but I lost proof of it in my language at the asylum.

442
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:30,845
I was raised in a very similar establishment myself.

443
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:34,475
Now everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another.

444
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:37,725
The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise.

445
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:41,445
The sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront.

446
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,565
The anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks.

447
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,535
Everybody owes,everybody pays...

448
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:52,615
...because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide.

449
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:55,995
- Is that right,boys? - Yeah,Bill. That's right.

450
00:45:56,205 --> 00:46:02,005
Enlist. Join up. Serve your country. Come on in out of the draft,boys.

451
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:04,425
Volunteer and get your $50 bonus.

452
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:10,555
We need 30,000 volunteers,and we're prepared to pay $677 per volunteer.

453
00:46:10,725 --> 00:46:13,095
- Please read this. Thank you. - Thanks.

454
00:46:13,265 --> 00:46:15,685
Would you like to take one of these to fill out?

455
00:46:15,895 --> 00:46:19,435
Three square meals a day. Three square meals a day.

456
00:46:19,605 --> 00:46:22,355
Young man,enlist and serve your country.

457
00:46:22,565 --> 00:46:24,525
Three square meals a day,gentlemen.

458
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:27,365
If you're interested, read this and consider joining.

459
00:46:27,525 --> 00:46:30,365
Everywhere you went people talked about the draft.

460
00:46:30,535 --> 00:46:33,745
Now,you could buy your way out for $300...

461
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:35,995
...but who had $300?

462
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:38,915
For us it might as well have been 3,000,000.

463
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:43,085
The recruiters? They was too scared of the gangs to come after us.

464
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:48,135
Besides,we never dreamt the war would ever touch New York.

465
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,715
Good morning,sir.

466
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,095
You!

467
00:46:53,595 --> 00:46:55,265
Don't you run into me.

468
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:58,395
Fair enough.

469
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,275
I said,don't run into me!

470
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:07,615
Well,sorry.

471
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,825
- Everything in place? - It seems so.

472
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:19,915
Well,then I leave you in the grace and favor of the Lord.

473
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,255
- Thank you. - That's right.

474
00:47:29,845 --> 00:47:33,135
Oh,the dirty mab!

475
00:47:36,805 --> 00:47:38,435
Oh,no.

476
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,065
- I'm sorry. - Allow me.

477
00:47:43,355 --> 00:47:46,815
- Thank you kindly,sir. - Oh,it's my pleasure.

478
00:47:47,605 --> 00:47:49,775
I hope you won't think me rude if I speak.

479
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:52,155
I wouldn't want to appear forward.

480
00:47:52,325 --> 00:47:57,165
Well,sir,that depends on what you say.

481
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:09,505
Would you call me reckless if I said you were the prettiest girl in New York?

482
00:48:09,715 --> 00:48:12,425
Only New York?

483
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:15,475
This is my stop.

484
00:48:17,635 --> 00:48:20,645
May I walk with you a little then?

485
00:48:20,805 --> 00:48:23,525
That,sir,would be too bold.

486
00:48:41,205 --> 00:48:42,335
Good morning.

487
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:54,215
For every lay we had a different name.

488
00:48:54,385 --> 00:48:56,675
An "angler" put a hook on the end of a stick...

489
00:48:56,885 --> 00:49:00,015
...to drop behind store windows and doors.

490
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:03,725
An "autumn diver" picked your pocket in church.

491
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:06,485
A "badger" gets a fellow into bed with a girl...

492
00:49:06,645 --> 00:49:09,565
...then robs his pockets while they're on the go.

493
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:13,865
Jenny was a "bludget," a girl pickpocket...

494
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:17,945
...and a "turtledove."

495
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,825
A turtledove goes uptown dressed like a housemaid...

496
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:26,705
...picks out a fine house and goes right through the back door.

497
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:28,415
Robs you blind.

498
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,715
It takes a lot of sand to be a turtledove.

499
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:59,785
I'll have my medal back. Oh,Jesus!

500
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,375
Don't do that again.

501
00:50:08,545 --> 00:50:11,375
Listen! I said,don't do that...

502
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:14,175
Go back to the Points and leave me to my business...

503
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:17,305
...or I will open your throat, so help me God.

504
00:50:20,635 --> 00:50:22,595
All right.

505
00:50:24,145 --> 00:50:26,145
Go on then.

506
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:30,275
I would.

507
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:33,155
Go on then.

508
00:50:55,465 --> 00:50:58,175
Now give me back my medal.

509
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:00,805
Make it quick!

510
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:10,855
I don't know which one's yours.

511
00:51:17,485 --> 00:51:19,865
Suppose I help myself to everything?

512
00:51:22,655 --> 00:51:24,405
Suppose you do.

513
00:52:03,575 --> 00:52:06,365
May I walk with you a little then?

514
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,585
What do you suppose a fellow could earn here in a day?

515
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:21,095
- Maybe we could pal in together. - Oh,I think you're a bit...

516
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:25,885
...rough for this sort of game. Besides,I work alone.

517
00:52:26,095 --> 00:52:29,015
Alone? Well,what do you quarter to the Butcher?

518
00:52:29,185 --> 00:52:31,435
- Me? Nothing. - Nothing?

519
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:34,145
The Butcher and me have a special arrangement.

520
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:45,405
- I don't want to see you again. - Well,I don't blame you.

521
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:48,995
Pennies in their pockets and hope in their eyes...

522
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,205
...they peer to the west...

523
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:55,955
...searching the horizon for a glimpse of land and salvation.

524
00:52:57,795 --> 00:52:59,375
A glimpse of America.

525
00:52:59,545 --> 00:53:02,885
Seeing all this poverty must be most unsettling,Miss Schermerhorn.

526
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:06,635
Some days,of course, the uptown gangs come down to us.

527
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:10,935
The Schermerhorns was one of the oldest families in New York.

528
00:53:11,095 --> 00:53:12,645
They didn't run the city...

529
00:53:12,805 --> 00:53:15,275
...but they was listened to carefully by them that did.

530
00:53:15,435 --> 00:53:17,235
Commissioner Brunt said you wished to view...

531
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:19,775
...the Points in all its splendor and squalor.

532
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:22,195
"Spare nothing concerning the conditions," said he.

533
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,285
Yeah,nothing except our safety,constable.

534
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:29,035
I'm sure we can be in no danger while we're in the constable's company.

535
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,785
Quite so,madam. Witness.

536
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,045
- Shall we continue on? - What,you dare to leave it there?

537
00:53:43,215 --> 00:53:47,805
Safe as a bank,Mr. Greeley, since all know it's mine.

538
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:53,185
- Is that man drunk? - Dead as Good Friday,miss.

539
00:53:57,475 --> 00:53:59,815
- Good day to you,Mulraney. - Boys.

540
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:01,735
- Jack. - Slum sociable?

541
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,405
Fact-finding. Reforms-studying.

542
00:54:04,565 --> 00:54:07,035
- May I present...? - The Schermerhorns of Fifth Avenue...

543
00:54:07,195 --> 00:54:09,365
...scarcely require an introduction from you.

544
00:54:09,575 --> 00:54:12,865
Schermerhorn,indeed. Their daughter. This gentleman,of course...

545
00:54:13,035 --> 00:54:16,335
Horace Greeley,the famous publisher. A pleasure and an honor.

546
00:54:16,705 --> 00:54:19,545
- Of the Tribune. - I'm William Cutting.

547
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:23,255
How do you do,Mr. Cutting?

548
00:54:24,715 --> 00:54:28,885
As of this moment,extremely well, thank you. How do you do?

549
00:54:29,425 --> 00:54:31,475
Orange blossom. Delicious.

550
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,935
- Mr. Cutting is... - What a peach.

551
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:36,055
She could have a fine career on the stage.

552
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:38,855
...one of Five Points' local... - A pleasure to meet you.

553
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,525
...leaders. - Mr. Greeley.

554
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,735
- Pleased to meet you. - The Points welcomes you.

555
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:45,905
You are welcome to these streets and will pass in safety.

556
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:51,785
Oh,I'll see to their safety. Thank you,Bill. There we are.

557
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,375
Good day,lads. Criminal's braggadocio,you see.

558
00:54:55,535 --> 00:54:59,755
- He knows who I am. - You're well-known in these parts.

559
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:03,375
I must say that I find that strangely flattering.

560
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:06,215
- I never did like crushers. - Well,draw it mild,son.

561
00:55:06,425 --> 00:55:10,925
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs without I tell him he may do so.

562
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:18,565
At the office or store He was kept he'll pretend

563
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:23,355
And so he was too Drinking rum with a friend

564
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:27,485
Do you think my watch would be safe up on that lamppost,Bill?

565
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,235
Why don't you hang it up there and see?

566
00:55:34,075 --> 00:55:35,245
Someday.

567
00:55:37,075 --> 00:55:38,585
Someday is right.

568
00:55:40,335 --> 00:55:42,375
This a new lad?

569
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:48,385
Just another bastard son of Erin I folded in the warmth of my embrace.

570
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:53,885
- Hey! - I just want to see your face,son.

571
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:56,225
No harm intended.

572
00:56:05,855 --> 00:56:08,655
Is a kind-loving husband

573
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:12,615
And a good-tempered wife

574
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:22,455
You get to know a lot butchering meat.

575
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,295
We're made up of the same things: Flesh and blood...

576
00:56:26,465 --> 00:56:29,755
...tissue,organs.

577
00:56:29,925 --> 00:56:32,635
I love to work with pigs.

578
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:38,095
The nearest thing in nature to the flesh of a man is the flesh of a pig.

579
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:40,435
- Pig,huh? - That's right.

580
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,145
This is for you,mother.

581
00:56:45,645 --> 00:56:46,985
There you go.

582
00:56:47,145 --> 00:56:50,155
- God bless you,Mr. Cutting. - God bless you.

583
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:54,825
- She ain't really my mother. - I knew that,Bill.

584
00:56:58,865 --> 00:57:01,245
This is the liver.

585
00:57:01,705 --> 00:57:03,495
The kidneys.

586
00:57:03,705 --> 00:57:05,545
The heart.

587
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:09,045
This is a wound. The stomach will bleed and bleed.

588
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:12,595
This is a kill. This is a kill.

589
00:57:13,425 --> 00:57:16,845
The main artery. This is a kill.

590
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:20,185
You try.

591
00:57:23,225 --> 00:57:24,685
Go ahead.

592
00:57:50,505 --> 00:57:53,005
The lung. Good. Don't foul the blade on the rib.

593
00:57:53,175 --> 00:57:55,345
Very good. Main artery.

594
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,265
Bleed him slow. Let him think about it for a while.

595
00:57:58,425 --> 00:58:01,305
Slow death. Good.

596
00:58:02,725 --> 00:58:06,065
You'll each bill the city $5000 a month for supplies and services...

597
00:58:06,225 --> 00:58:08,025
...of which you'll receive 10%.

598
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:12,025
Bill! Mr. Killoran will work out the details. Thank you,gentlemen.

599
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:15,195
That's how we do things around Tammany,gentlemen.

600
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:17,325
Who's this then?

601
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:20,245
Thank you,boys.

602
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:22,455
Good day,sir.

603
00:58:34,085 --> 00:58:36,595
You got something on your mind?

604
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:41,435
Bill's taken quite a liking to you.

605
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,935
Now,if you're up to something,bene.

606
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:50,315
Only I don't want no part in it.

607
00:58:55,025 --> 00:58:58,535
I was in Hellgate for 16 years.

608
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:01,285
I'm just trying to make my way is all.

609
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,615
Just like you.

610
00:59:04,665 --> 00:59:06,875
Unless,of course, you got a better notion?

611
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:09,455
No.

612
00:59:10,455 --> 00:59:14,505
Bill,I can't get a day's work done for all the good citizens...

613
00:59:14,675 --> 00:59:18,175
...coming in here to harass me about crime in the Points.

614
00:59:18,345 --> 00:59:20,845
Some even go so far as to accuse Tammany...

615
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,765
...of connivance in this so-called rampant criminality.

616
00:59:24,935 --> 00:59:28,055
What am I to do? I can't have this. Something has to be done.

617
00:59:28,225 --> 00:59:30,605
- What do you have in mind? - I don't know.

618
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,025
I think maybe we should hang someone.

619
00:59:34,315 --> 00:59:36,445
- Who? - No one important,necessarily.

620
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:41,155
Average men will do. Back-alley amusers with no affiliations.

621
00:59:41,365 --> 00:59:45,035
- How many? - Three or four.

622
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:48,955
- Which? - Four.

623
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:53,125
You stand here convicted varyingly...

624
00:59:53,295 --> 00:59:56,375
...of lewdness,jack-rolling...

625
00:59:56,545 --> 01:00:00,345
...sneak-thievery, chloral-hydrating...

626
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:03,175
...sodomy,strangulation...

627
01:00:03,385 --> 01:00:08,305
...and enthusiastic corruption of the public good.

628
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:11,685
- We all go someday,huh? - Chin up.

629
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:14,065
Handsome bunch of gallows fruit. There's my old friend.

630
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:17,195
- How are you feeling,Arthur? - I'm okay. I'm okay.

631
01:00:17,355 --> 01:00:20,365
Say hello to Amsterdam. Nearly fishhooked McGloin the other day.

632
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,695
- How do you do? - Nearly.

633
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:23,575
See you dressed for the occasion.

634
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,905
You know me, always like to look me best.

635
01:00:26,075 --> 01:00:27,575
That's the spirit.

636
01:00:29,075 --> 01:00:32,045
Nice locket. I'll give you a dollar for it.

637
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:33,875
It's me mother's.

638
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:35,465
Dollar and a half?

639
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:37,755
Done.

640
01:00:41,255 --> 01:00:42,805
We'll miss you,Arthur.

641
01:00:42,965 --> 01:00:45,135
- See you in the hot country,Seamus. - Hot corn!

642
01:00:45,305 --> 01:00:48,435
Ears of early white corn! Hot corn!

643
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:54,605
Is my son present here?

644
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:57,945
Where's my little fella?

645
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:01,905
Look at your dad.

646
01:01:02,115 --> 01:01:04,155
Farewell,dear boy.

647
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:10,455
I never struck a foul blow, nor turned a card.

648
01:01:11,955 --> 01:01:15,455
May God greet me as a friend.

649
01:01:39,485 --> 01:01:43,025
And grace my fears relieved

650
01:01:43,195 --> 01:01:47,155
How precious Did that grace appear

651
01:01:47,325 --> 01:01:50,205
That night, the reformers held a dance.

652
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:52,875
That was the Five Points,all right.

653
01:01:53,035 --> 01:01:56,335
Hangings of a morning, dancings of an evening.

654
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,415
- Sure meself,but...

655
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:01,425
...it's not a matter of words. I can tell by the way she smiles at me.

656
01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:03,505
- She smiles at a lot of people. - Sir.

657
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:04,965
You don't know her.

658
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:08,725
A penny of gratitude for a fighting Irishman,young sir.

659
01:02:11,935 --> 01:02:15,315
- You from Kerry? - I am,sir. I am.

660
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,895
- It ain't much. - Thank you,sir. Thank you.

661
01:02:19,065 --> 01:02:21,655
Ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted to see...

662
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:25,275
...so many young faces at our first annual Mission dance.

663
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:27,325
This'll be a real ballum rancum,eh?

664
01:02:27,485 --> 01:02:30,495
The Mission welcomes Christians of every stamp...

665
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,285
...and we are particularly happy to greet our Roman Catholic friends...

666
01:02:34,455 --> 01:02:36,415
...who join us here tonight.

667
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:40,465
- Ladies! Come with me. Come with me. - Shall we dance?

668
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:43,505
We're going to start the dancing in just a moment.

669
01:02:43,675 --> 01:02:44,675
No.

670
01:02:45,385 --> 01:02:49,265
- Good evening,Reverend. - Good evening,Your Holiness.

671
01:02:51,345 --> 01:02:52,515
Good evening,Reverend.

672
01:02:52,885 --> 01:02:55,805
Looks as though you should have shaved closer.

673
01:02:59,565 --> 01:03:02,895
Good evening,Reverend. I do beg your pardon.

674
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:09,115
Miss...?

675
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,205
- Everdeane. - Miss Everdeane.

676
01:03:28,345 --> 01:03:33,305
Now,gentlemen,over here, if you don't mind. Thank you.

677
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:36,305
Open it. Hold it up.

678
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:40,475
Into the mirror.

679
01:04:33,155 --> 01:04:34,655
That one.

680
01:04:36,285 --> 01:04:39,665
Our queen has chosen.

681
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,765
Sir...

682
01:04:59,935 --> 01:05:02,395
...your lady. - Right.

683
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,485
Regular services are held at the church at 6 and 8.

684
01:05:05,645 --> 01:05:06,695
Go to hell.

685
01:05:16,155 --> 01:05:18,325
- What do you think you're doing? - Dancing.

686
01:05:18,495 --> 01:05:21,745
- I said,why'd you pick me? - That's none of your business.

687
01:05:21,915 --> 01:05:23,795
Would you mind telling me?

688
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:25,915
I'm sorry.

689
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,965
Goddamn it!

690
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:33,255
I'm sorry. I'm not much of a dancer.

691
01:05:33,425 --> 01:05:35,265
Just try to keep calm.

692
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:39,685
- I never been to a stepping-ken before. - It's best not to look down.

693
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:44,475
You can hold me tighter if you like.

694
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:53,905
- All right? - Aye.

695
01:05:55,735 --> 01:05:58,615
So why didn't you dance with Johnny?

696
01:06:00,035 --> 01:06:01,535
Because...

697
01:06:04,165 --> 01:06:06,335
...I didn't want him.

698
01:07:04,595 --> 01:07:06,895
I'm not wanting this.

699
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,115
- Wait. - What?

700
01:07:15,315 --> 01:07:16,865
Wait.

701
01:07:17,735 --> 01:07:18,945
How does this open?

702
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:23,075
It takes too long to lace back up. We'll be here all night.

703
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:37,465
Sure,all right,I'll take it off.

704
01:07:58,945 --> 01:08:01,785
There was a baby. They cut it out.

705
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,995
I'm sorry.

706
01:08:09,035 --> 01:08:11,125
Oh,it's fine.

707
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:17,385
Have you got any scars?

708
01:08:18,885 --> 01:08:20,675
One or two.

709
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,815
What's that,then?

710
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:22,365
That?

711
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,945
It's a gift from Mr. Cutting.

712
01:09:29,285 --> 01:09:31,075
A gift?

713
01:09:31,745 --> 01:09:33,625
A gift.

714
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,335
Was it your birthday?

715
01:09:37,665 --> 01:09:39,335
No.

716
01:09:43,505 --> 01:09:45,885
What'd you give him,then?

717
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:50,805
The answer to that has nothing to do with you.

718
01:09:57,605 --> 01:10:00,105
- Don't tell me you're angry with me. - No.

719
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:02,815
I'm through with you.

720
01:10:06,825 --> 01:10:09,575
Well,you're quicker than most fellows.

721
01:10:09,745 --> 01:10:12,035
Generally,they wait till afterwards.

722
01:10:12,205 --> 01:10:15,205
I ain't interested in the Butcher's leavings.

723
01:10:34,935 --> 01:10:37,435
Hey! Bill says keep clear of the pikers.

724
01:10:37,645 --> 01:10:40,525
- Fifteen to one,Bug-Eye Moran. - Amsterdam!

725
01:10:41,395 --> 01:10:43,695
Everyone was working for the Butcher.

726
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,695
We ran his errands, made his money...

727
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:47,865
...took a piece and said, "Thank you,sir."

728
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,655
- Gentlemen,it's a raid! - Even Tweed.

729
01:10:50,825 --> 01:10:53,205
- The fight's over. - Even me.

730
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:56,085
- All right,you stupid... - My father's son.

731
01:10:56,495 --> 01:10:58,665
- What the hell is this? - Sorry,Bill.

732
01:10:58,835 --> 01:11:02,715
The city ordinance against boxiana's a blight,I grant you,but some...

733
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:05,845
I'm losing revenue while you speechify. Collect those bets!

734
01:11:06,045 --> 01:11:08,055
How do I collect if no one won the fight?

735
01:11:08,215 --> 01:11:11,055
This counts as a "no decision." You got that covered,right?

736
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,185
Didn't anybody pay off the police?

737
01:11:13,345 --> 01:11:16,015
We paid the Municipal Police. This is Metropolitan.

738
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:18,185
- You'll repay me every cent. - Mr. Tweed...

739
01:11:18,395 --> 01:11:20,565
- Who asked for your opinion? - Let him speak!

740
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,065
He don't answer to you.

741
01:11:22,395 --> 01:11:24,905
The law says there's no boxing in the city,right?

742
01:11:25,065 --> 01:11:28,405
- That's right. In the city. - Well,where does the city end?

743
01:11:35,535 --> 01:11:39,625
The winner,in the 75th round...

744
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:44,715
Allow me to acknowledge the man whose vision and enterprise made possible...

745
01:11:44,885 --> 01:11:47,715
...the staging of this noble combat...

746
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:51,845
...in these awe-inspiring and entirely legal surroundings:

747
01:11:52,055 --> 01:11:55,015
Mr. William Cutting!

748
01:11:57,555 --> 01:12:01,895
And... And his young associate!

749
01:12:02,275 --> 01:12:04,025
That's you,boy.

750
01:12:05,945 --> 01:12:07,775
Come on,get in there. Come on,son.

751
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,075
You done very good. How do you like them apples?

752
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:15,075
We done good. We done all right.

753
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,245
- While I have your attention... - It was a good show.

754
01:12:18,455 --> 01:12:20,835
...may I remind you of the wonders that await you...

755
01:12:20,995 --> 01:12:24,965
...at my museum located on Broadway!

756
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:28,465
P.T. Barnum's Gallery of Wonders!

757
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:34,845
- That's my money! - Get your hands out of me pockets!

758
01:12:37,435 --> 01:12:41,525
It's a funny feeling being took under the wing of a dragon.

759
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:44,275
It's warmer than you think.

760
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:48,195
That's the building of our country right there,Mr. Cutting.

761
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:50,235
Americans aborning.

762
01:12:50,405 --> 01:12:54,075
I don't see no Americans. I see trespassers.

763
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:57,825
Irish harps will do a job for a nickel what a nigger does for a dime...

764
01:12:57,995 --> 01:12:59,955
...and a white man used to get a quarter for.

765
01:13:00,165 --> 01:13:02,545
What have they done? Name one thing they've contributed.

766
01:13:02,705 --> 01:13:05,125
- Votes. - Votes,you say?

767
01:13:05,295 --> 01:13:08,335
They vote how the archbishop tells them. And who tells him?

768
01:13:08,505 --> 01:13:12,805
Their king in the pointy hat what sits on his throne in Rome.

769
01:13:12,965 --> 01:13:15,975
Bill's got mixed feelings as regards the Irish.

770
01:13:17,015 --> 01:13:21,185
Deliver these good and fervent folk to the polls on a regular basis...

771
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:25,855
...and there'll be a handsome price for each vote goes Tammany's way.

772
01:13:28,355 --> 01:13:32,325
My father gave his life making this country what it is.

773
01:13:32,485 --> 01:13:37,745
Murdered by the British with all his men on the 25th of July,anno Domini 1814.

774
01:13:37,905 --> 01:13:40,705
You think I'm gonna help you befoul his legacy...

775
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:44,495
...by giving this country over to them what's had no hand in fighting for it?

776
01:13:44,665 --> 01:13:48,675
Why? Because they come off a boat, crawling with lice and begging for soup?

777
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:53,595
You're a great one for the fighting, I know,but you can't fight forever.

778
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:57,015
- I can go down doing it. - And you will.

779
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:02,475
What did you say?

780
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:05,855
I said,you're turning your back on the future.

781
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:10,275
Not our future.

782
01:14:15,655 --> 01:14:19,575
That document makes you a citizen. This makes you a private in the Union Army.

783
01:14:19,745 --> 01:14:21,625
Now go fight for your country.

784
01:14:21,785 --> 01:14:23,495
Next.

785
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:26,755
Sign here,son. Or make your mark.

786
01:14:26,915 --> 01:14:29,295
You're in the Army now. Three square meals a day.

787
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,585
Uniforms first,then weapons.

788
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:36,215
- I haven't eaten in two days. - Keep moving,men.

789
01:14:44,975 --> 01:14:47,565
There's your musket. Keep it dry on the boat.

790
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,195
- Same for this cartridge case. - Where are we going?

791
01:14:50,355 --> 01:14:52,065
- I heard Tennessee. - Where's that?

792
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:08,625
Do they feed us now,do you think?

793
01:15:17,965 --> 01:15:22,055
My children! My children!

794
01:15:22,765 --> 01:15:27,105
We must heal the divisions between us.

795
01:15:27,265 --> 01:15:28,315
This war must cease.

796
01:15:31,395 --> 01:15:34,485
North and South must stand united!

797
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:42,325
You're a liar! Rubbish!

798
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:48,665
- What happens at the finish,then? - Then we have ourselves a rowdy-dow.

799
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:52,585
- Ain't you been to the theater before? - No.

800
01:15:52,795 --> 01:15:56,845
Mr. Legree,lay down your whip.

801
01:15:57,005 --> 01:16:00,885
Miss Eliza, join hands with Mr. Shelby.

802
01:16:01,055 --> 01:16:07,475
And,Topsy,dear little Topsy, cradle Uncle Tom's head.

803
01:16:08,055 --> 01:16:10,025
Leave the nigger dead!

804
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:21,155
Get me down!

805
01:16:21,365 --> 01:16:24,365
Down with the Union!

806
01:16:24,535 --> 01:16:26,245
Down with the Union!

807
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,085
Down with the Union!

808
01:16:28,245 --> 01:16:30,375
- Down with the Union! - Down with the Union!

809
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:51,105
- For the blood of the Irish! - Bill,get down!

810
01:17:00,235 --> 01:17:03,115
Somebody's popped the Butcher!

811
01:17:13,835 --> 01:17:17,085
Stifle that rat bastard down!

812
01:17:23,425 --> 01:17:26,095
God,forgive me.

813
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:45,405
Whose man are you?

814
01:17:45,575 --> 01:17:48,165
Speak smart and speak up.

815
01:17:49,115 --> 01:17:50,625
What's he saying,boy?

816
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:54,875
I think he's making his peace with God.

817
01:17:55,085 --> 01:17:57,255
The hell with that. He makes peace with me.

818
01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:01,085
I'm hearing confession tonight, you mother-whoring Irish nigger!

819
01:18:01,255 --> 01:18:03,885
Whose man are you? We speak English in this country.

820
01:18:04,095 --> 01:18:05,845
Whose man are you? See this knife?

821
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:09,055
I'm gonna teach you to speak English with this fucking knife!

822
01:18:09,265 --> 01:18:10,765
Whose man are you?

823
01:18:10,975 --> 01:18:13,225
Whose man are you?

824
01:18:28,455 --> 01:18:31,705
Well,that didn't tell us very much.

825
01:18:34,245 --> 01:18:36,415
Fine waistcoat.

826
01:18:36,915 --> 01:18:40,545
Shame about it. I don't think it can be mended.

827
01:18:40,965 --> 01:18:44,295
Will I keep it as a souvenir?

828
01:19:17,665 --> 01:19:20,505
Where's Legree? Where's Mopsy?

829
01:19:20,665 --> 01:19:25,425
Tragedians,let's continue. Intermission is over!

830
01:19:42,735 --> 01:19:45,525
Now that was bloody Shakespearean.

831
01:19:45,695 --> 01:19:49,235
- What? - Do you know who Shakespeare was?

832
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,325
He was the fellow who wrote the King James Bible.

833
01:19:52,535 --> 01:19:54,785
I don't know what you're talking about.

834
01:19:54,955 --> 01:19:57,915
That's because you're a thick, ignorant,barbarous Irish whelp.

835
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:59,875
Just like your father.

836
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:05,465
That's it.

837
01:20:05,635 --> 01:20:10,055
Tear my head off and destruct the world, just like the rest of the stupid Irish.

838
01:20:10,215 --> 01:20:15,595
- That's why I never ran with your dad. - Get off me,you crazy bastard!

839
01:20:18,435 --> 01:20:22,145
It means,if you're not strong, you'd better be smart.

840
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:25,065
I don't know if you're being too clever or too dumb.

841
01:20:25,235 --> 01:20:27,405
Whichever it is, just remember this much.

842
01:20:27,565 --> 01:20:32,785
For all his faults,your father was a man who loved his people.

843
01:20:38,995 --> 01:20:41,755
Amsterdam! Amsterdam!

844
01:20:41,915 --> 01:20:44,665
New York is calling you.

845
01:20:56,095 --> 01:21:00,265
Look at that. What in Christ's name is that?

846
01:21:00,935 --> 01:21:06,395
Rhythms of the Dark Continent thrown into the kettle with an Irish shindig.

847
01:21:06,565 --> 01:21:11,445
Stir it around a few times,pull it out, it's a fine American mess.

848
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,325
A jig doing a jig.

849
01:21:15,405 --> 01:21:17,325
A little keepsake.

850
01:21:20,665 --> 01:21:23,045
- Good on you,sir. - Come upstairs with me,Bill.

851
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,585
Have I ever had you before?

852
01:21:29,005 --> 01:21:31,505
So you don't call me by my Christian name.

853
01:21:33,005 --> 01:21:35,175
Bill! Thank God you're all right.

854
01:21:35,345 --> 01:21:37,595
I heard the news and came as quick as I could.

855
01:21:37,765 --> 01:21:39,935
You're as timely as the Angel of Death.

856
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:44,725
Bill,you're not suggesting that I would stoop to what you're suggesting?

857
01:21:44,895 --> 01:21:48,525
Stop slabbering. If I thought it was you, you'd be in a wooden coat.

858
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:52,025
The hole in my shoulder hurts, so have a drink and shut up.

859
01:21:52,195 --> 01:21:54,575
Or shut up and get out.

860
01:21:54,945 --> 01:21:56,495
I believe I'll have a drink.

861
01:21:56,655 --> 01:21:58,705
Careful,Tweedy, the mort's Frenchified.

862
01:21:59,955 --> 01:22:03,375
No,no,I'm clean. Come on,let's go to the bar.

863
01:22:16,215 --> 01:22:18,185
- Jenny. - Bill.

864
01:22:42,455 --> 01:22:44,535
It's gotta be tight.

865
01:22:44,705 --> 01:22:46,755
She loves to make me cry.

866
01:22:47,665 --> 01:22:49,125
You can take it.

867
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,305
There's my boy.

868
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:07,855
It's all right.

869
01:23:13,565 --> 01:23:15,575
To the Butcher.

870
01:23:20,035 --> 01:23:22,245
We're all much obliged.

871
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:25,165
Forever.

872
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:28,165
- Bill the Butcher. - To the Butcher.

873
01:23:37,385 --> 01:23:39,385
Why don't you get out of here,Johnny?

874
01:23:42,635 --> 01:23:43,805
Go on. Go.

875
01:24:01,405 --> 01:24:04,455
Is there anyone in the Five Points you haven't fucked?

876
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,125
You!

877
01:24:16,595 --> 01:24:18,635
Calm down!

878
01:24:29,895 --> 01:24:31,985
Try it and I'll bite you!

879
01:24:32,185 --> 01:24:35,695
If you were gonna bite me, I don't think you'd warn me,huh?

880
01:24:35,855 --> 01:24:37,695
Find out.

881
01:25:55,766 --> 01:25:57,356
I can't sleep.

882
01:26:03,606 --> 01:26:07,736
I hope you don't mind us laying out tonight here,sir.

883
01:26:08,576 --> 01:26:11,486
Whatever takes your fancy, my young friend.

884
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:24,416
Is it your shoulder that's keeping you up?

885
01:26:24,586 --> 01:26:27,336
No,I don't never sleep too much.

886
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:32,056
I have to sleep with one eye open. I only got one eye,right?

887
01:26:36,766 --> 01:26:39,606
How old are you,Amsterdam?

888
01:26:44,356 --> 01:26:46,696
I'm not too sure.

889
01:26:46,856 --> 01:26:48,616
I never did figure it.

890
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:52,156
I'm 47.

891
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:56,456
Forty-seven years old.

892
01:27:00,206 --> 01:27:03,876
You know how I stayed alive this long? All these years?

893
01:27:06,466 --> 01:27:08,426
Fear.

894
01:27:10,136 --> 01:27:13,136
The spectacle of fearsome acts.

895
01:27:14,136 --> 01:27:17,266
Somebody steals from me, I cut off his hands.

896
01:27:17,436 --> 01:27:20,606
He offends me, I cut out his tongue.

897
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:26,236
He rises against me, I cut off his head,stick it on a pike...

898
01:27:26,436 --> 01:27:30,486
...and raise it high up so all in the streets can see.

899
01:27:31,566 --> 01:27:34,986
That's what preserves the order of things.

900
01:27:38,536 --> 01:27:40,246
Fear.

901
01:27:42,876 --> 01:27:44,666
That one tonight...

902
01:27:44,836 --> 01:27:46,966
...who was he?

903
01:27:48,546 --> 01:27:50,546
A nobody.

904
01:27:51,506 --> 01:27:53,466
A coward.

905
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:59,136
What an ignominious end that would have been.

906
01:28:02,146 --> 01:28:07,486
I killed the last honorable man 15 years ago. Since then,it's...

907
01:28:09,696 --> 01:28:12,696
You've seen his portrait downstairs?

908
01:28:16,036 --> 01:28:19,326
Is your mouth glued up with cunny juice? I asked you a question!

909
01:28:19,496 --> 01:28:21,826
I said,I seen it,sir.

910
01:28:27,086 --> 01:28:30,166
Oh,you got a murderous rage in you,and I like it.

911
01:28:30,376 --> 01:28:34,546
It's life boiling up inside of you. It's good.

912
01:28:38,096 --> 01:28:42,556
The Priest and me, we lived by the same principles.

913
01:28:44,856 --> 01:28:48,026
It was only faith divided us.

914
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:52,196
He give me this,you know.

915
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:01,206
That was the finest beating I ever took.

916
01:29:01,866 --> 01:29:03,416
My face was pulp...

917
01:29:03,576 --> 01:29:07,376
...my guts was pierced and my ribs was all mashed up.

918
01:29:11,926 --> 01:29:14,716
And when he came to finish me...

919
01:29:18,676 --> 01:29:21,476
...I couldn't look him in the eye.

920
01:29:27,396 --> 01:29:32,236
He spared me because he wanted me to live in shame.

921
01:29:32,446 --> 01:29:34,946
This was a great man.

922
01:29:37,576 --> 01:29:39,656
A great man.

923
01:29:42,576 --> 01:29:45,786
So I cut out the eye that looked away.

924
01:29:48,586 --> 01:29:51,126
Sent it to him,wrapped in blue paper.

925
01:29:52,046 --> 01:29:55,796
I would have cut them both out if I could have fought him blind.

926
01:29:57,796 --> 01:30:00,886
Then I rose back up again with a full heart...

927
01:30:01,056 --> 01:30:03,886
...and buried him in his own blood.

928
01:30:12,896 --> 01:30:14,896
Well done.

929
01:30:17,776 --> 01:30:21,406
He was the only man I ever killed worth remembering.

930
01:30:33,006 --> 01:30:35,546
I never had a son.

931
01:30:43,726 --> 01:30:46,636
Civilization is crumbling.

932
01:31:04,866 --> 01:31:07,206
God bless you.

933
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:40,776
If you got anything to say...

934
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:44,116
...now is the time to say it.

935
01:31:44,286 --> 01:31:46,496
Who is he to you,Jenny?

936
01:31:52,746 --> 01:31:55,296
I was 12 years old.

937
01:31:55,456 --> 01:31:59,216
My mother was dead. I was living in a doorway.

938
01:32:01,586 --> 01:32:06,056
He took me in,took care of me...

939
01:32:06,926 --> 01:32:08,976
...in his own way.

940
01:32:14,016 --> 01:32:16,686
After they cut out the baby...

941
01:32:19,236 --> 01:32:22,906
Well,he doesn't fancy girls that scarred up.

942
01:32:29,746 --> 01:32:34,206
You should know in your own mind...

943
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:39,506
...that he never laid a hand on me until I asked him to.

944
01:33:01,946 --> 01:33:04,236
Who are you?

945
01:33:05,116 --> 01:33:07,616
Who are you?

946
01:34:24,356 --> 01:34:27,906
Gentlemen. Fine gentlemen, you are most welcome...

947
01:34:28,066 --> 01:34:31,866
...to this palace of wonder and enchantment...

948
01:34:32,036 --> 01:34:36,996
...where visions to rival the finest imaginings of Scheherezade...

949
01:34:37,206 --> 01:34:40,166
...and her tales from the perfumed nights of Arabia...

950
01:34:40,376 --> 01:34:44,336
...will greet your famished eyes.

951
01:35:03,106 --> 01:35:06,526
What am I bid for this flaxen-haired Teutonic beauty?

952
01:35:07,066 --> 01:35:12,406
Feast your eyes on the magnificent plumage of these exotic creatures.

953
01:35:12,576 --> 01:35:15,496
Gentlemen,you've seen our caged birds.

954
01:35:15,656 --> 01:35:19,876
Well,how'd you like to make them sing?

955
01:35:20,076 --> 01:35:26,216
Let me see the color of your money, and they could be singing for you.

956
01:35:32,256 --> 01:35:35,726
May God put the steel of the Holy Spirit in my spine...

957
01:35:37,016 --> 01:35:40,556
...and the love of the Blessed Virgin in my heart.

958
01:35:43,526 --> 01:35:45,526
Amen.

959
01:35:49,356 --> 01:35:51,366
Easy now.

960
01:35:51,526 --> 01:35:53,366
What did you say?

961
01:35:53,536 --> 01:35:56,036
He's not who he says he is.

962
01:35:56,956 --> 01:35:58,706
He's not who he says he is?

963
01:35:58,866 --> 01:36:02,916
What am I bid? What am I bid? What am I bid?

964
01:36:03,336 --> 01:36:06,706
Count your blessings he considers you a friend.

965
01:36:07,876 --> 01:36:13,046
The only thing he considers,every day and every night,is how best to kill you.

966
01:36:14,386 --> 01:36:18,226
You got a loose tongue in your head. You want me to take it out for you?

967
01:36:18,386 --> 01:36:21,646
I'll bury it right up your fundament where it belongs.

968
01:36:21,856 --> 01:36:24,066
I can read right through you. You're empty...

969
01:36:24,226 --> 01:36:26,646
His name is Vallon!

970
01:36:28,236 --> 01:36:32,236
Don't do it,Bill. His name's Vallon.

971
01:37:03,766 --> 01:37:06,516
They're curious people, these Celestials.

972
01:37:06,686 --> 01:37:07,936
Don't trust this guy.

973
01:37:08,106 --> 01:37:10,106
- Know why he wears short sleeves? - Why?

974
01:37:10,276 --> 01:37:12,606
So everyone can see he's got nothing stashed.

975
01:37:12,906 --> 01:37:15,986
Jesus,let's hope that never becomes the fashion.

976
01:37:22,326 --> 01:37:24,166
Johnny.

977
01:38:01,446 --> 01:38:03,246
Get up.

978
01:38:17,966 --> 01:38:23,226
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your kind attention.

979
01:38:23,386 --> 01:38:25,896
As some of you have surely noticed...

980
01:38:26,056 --> 01:38:30,066
...our friend and benefactor Mr. William Cutting...

981
01:38:30,226 --> 01:38:36,656
...is tonight wearing a waistcoat of certain distinction.

982
01:38:37,736 --> 01:38:39,366
Might we...

983
01:38:41,036 --> 01:38:44,576
Might we tonight appeal to him to favor us...

984
01:38:44,746 --> 01:38:48,996
...with another exciting exhibition of skill...

985
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:54,506
...courage,daring and drama!

986
01:39:06,766 --> 01:39:11,436
- The Sword of Damascus! - The Tomahawk!

987
01:39:13,106 --> 01:39:14,776
Bill's going up.

988
01:39:21,826 --> 01:39:23,696
Show us your knives.

989
01:39:23,866 --> 01:39:26,406
Strut your stuff,Billy boy.

990
01:39:26,576 --> 01:39:28,996
Sword of Damascus!

991
01:39:42,846 --> 01:39:45,976
- The Spider's Kiss! - The River of Blood!

992
01:39:46,136 --> 01:39:49,766
- The Morning Glory! - The Wheel of Death!

993
01:39:49,936 --> 01:39:52,186
- William Tell! - The Butterfly!

994
01:39:52,516 --> 01:39:54,276
- The Tomahawk! - The Spider's Kiss!

995
01:39:54,646 --> 01:39:56,526
The Butcher's Apprentice!

996
01:39:56,686 --> 01:39:58,026
The Butcher's Apprentice.

997
01:39:58,196 --> 01:40:01,486
- Command performance. - Command performance.

998
01:40:01,736 --> 01:40:04,036
- Command performance. - Where have you been?

999
01:40:04,196 --> 01:40:06,656
A command performance indeed!

1000
01:40:06,826 --> 01:40:08,496
- Get out of here. - Don't do it.

1001
01:40:08,666 --> 01:40:13,286
And for this I must beg the indulgence of my former assistant...

1002
01:40:13,456 --> 01:40:15,916
...in matters of impalement.

1003
01:40:16,086 --> 01:40:19,546
The Butcher's original apprentice.

1004
01:40:20,386 --> 01:40:25,466
What do you say,Jen? One more time for the sweet souvenir?

1005
01:40:25,636 --> 01:40:27,556
Come on.

1006
01:40:36,896 --> 01:40:38,986
Don't you do it.

1007
01:40:39,646 --> 01:40:41,906
Good girl,Jenny.

1008
01:40:42,066 --> 01:40:45,906
- Don't be afraid. - What a woman.

1009
01:40:48,496 --> 01:40:50,326
Good evening,Bill.

1010
01:40:50,496 --> 01:40:52,576
She'll be all right.

1011
01:40:55,336 --> 01:40:58,506
- Remember this? - Of course.

1012
01:41:07,266 --> 01:41:12,396
You may feel more comfortable without that garment,Miss Everdeane.

1013
01:41:13,606 --> 01:41:16,766
You'll have to filch me a new one,Bill.

1014
01:41:30,036 --> 01:41:32,536
Anything in your pockets tonight?

1015
01:41:32,706 --> 01:41:35,036
Oh,I ain't started working yet.

1016
01:41:38,206 --> 01:41:41,086
What about that locket that I gave you?

1017
01:41:56,396 --> 01:41:59,816
Apologies,my dear. Pick it up.

1018
01:42:04,656 --> 01:42:06,566
Whoopsie-daisy!

1019
01:42:08,576 --> 01:42:11,076
Now it's good and broke.

1020
01:42:12,076 --> 01:42:14,576
I can't seem to get anything right tonight.

1021
01:42:22,256 --> 01:42:26,086
You got the sand to give them a grand finale?

1022
01:42:34,266 --> 01:42:37,516
Maybe when you're aiming a little straighter.

1023
01:42:45,196 --> 01:42:49,776
Still got some blood in you,Jen? Enough of this heathen music!

1024
01:42:49,946 --> 01:42:53,116
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys. Strike up,boys!

1025
01:42:53,286 --> 01:42:58,706
Ready? This is a night for Americans!

1026
01:43:05,716 --> 01:43:08,216
- Jenny! - Get your hands off me.

1027
01:43:08,386 --> 01:43:11,466
- Go away. - Get your hands off me!

1028
01:43:14,556 --> 01:43:15,806
Move.

1029
01:43:15,976 --> 01:43:18,056
Amsterdam!

1030
01:44:03,226 --> 01:44:05,436
Hats off!

1031
01:44:11,946 --> 01:44:16,656
We hold in our hearts the memory of our fallen brothers...

1032
01:44:16,906 --> 01:44:20,416
...whose blood stains the very streets we walk today.

1033
01:44:21,996 --> 01:44:27,796
Also on this night,we pay tribute to the leader of our enemies...

1034
01:44:29,506 --> 01:44:34,426
...an honorable man who crossed over bravely...

1035
01:44:34,596 --> 01:44:37,266
...fighting for what he believed in.

1036
01:44:43,436 --> 01:44:48,106
To defeat my enemy, I extinguish his life...

1037
01:44:48,276 --> 01:44:52,276
...and consume him as I consume these flames.

1038
01:44:53,696 --> 01:44:55,946
In honor of Priest Vallon.

1039
01:45:04,456 --> 01:45:05,996
That's a wound.

1040
01:45:06,376 --> 01:45:08,716
God!

1041
01:45:15,256 --> 01:45:20,386
I want you all to meet the son of Priest Vallon.

1042
01:45:20,556 --> 01:45:23,226
I took him under my wing...

1043
01:45:23,396 --> 01:45:25,186
...and see how I'm repaid?

1044
01:45:25,356 --> 01:45:27,526
- You bastard! - Saves my life one day...

1045
01:45:27,686 --> 01:45:30,236
...so he can kill me the next like a sneak-thief...

1046
01:45:30,396 --> 01:45:33,406
...instead of fighting like a man.

1047
01:45:33,866 --> 01:45:38,116
A base defiler, unworthy of a noble name.

1048
01:45:40,536 --> 01:45:42,956
God! Jesus!

1049
01:45:51,376 --> 01:45:54,426
All right,that'll do,McGloin. Splay him out.

1050
01:45:55,596 --> 01:46:00,386
This show ain't for blackies. You! You get to watch.

1051
01:46:01,886 --> 01:46:04,556
Don't you hear,nigger?

1052
01:46:05,936 --> 01:46:09,726
This is fresh meat. You know what I mean?

1053
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:13,196
We need to tenderize this meat a little bit.

1054
01:46:13,356 --> 01:46:17,196
All right,let's kiss good night to that pretty young face of yours.

1055
01:46:21,826 --> 01:46:23,076
No!

1056
01:46:27,586 --> 01:46:29,586
No!

1057
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:34,586
What'll it be,then? Rib or chop? Loin or shank?

1058
01:46:34,756 --> 01:46:36,716
- The liver! - The spleen!

1059
01:46:36,926 --> 01:46:38,596
- The tongue! - Kidneys!

1060
01:46:44,936 --> 01:46:47,056
- The lungs! - The liver!

1061
01:46:47,226 --> 01:46:49,066
- The tongue! - The kidneys!

1062
01:46:49,266 --> 01:46:51,566
- The stomach! - The heart! The heart!

1063
01:46:51,726 --> 01:46:54,236
The heart? This boy has no heart.

1064
01:46:54,446 --> 01:46:57,196
- Then kill him! - Kill him!

1065
01:47:02,446 --> 01:47:07,076
He ain't earned a death. He ain't earned a death at my hands.

1066
01:47:07,376 --> 01:47:11,876
No. He'll walk amongst you marked with shame...

1067
01:47:12,046 --> 01:47:17,466
...a freak worthy of Barnum's Museum of Wonders.

1068
01:47:17,636 --> 01:47:21,056
God's only man spared by the Butcher.

1069
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,636
No,Bill!

1070
01:47:23,806 --> 01:47:26,806
No! No!

1071
01:47:27,186 --> 01:47:30,646
No! No! No!

1072
01:47:30,816 --> 01:47:34,276
No! No! No!

1073
01:48:00,676 --> 01:48:02,846
Here. Here!

1074
01:48:03,056 --> 01:48:05,476
This way. Come on. Come on!

1075
01:48:51,516 --> 01:48:53,816
I wanna show you something.

1076
01:48:58,696 --> 01:49:01,866
My mother's bones share this grave.

1077
01:49:03,866 --> 01:49:08,536
I've saved 10 cents out of every dollar I've ever earned since I was 13.

1078
01:49:08,706 --> 01:49:10,826
That's $215.

1079
01:49:10,996 --> 01:49:16,796
That's $215 for bludgeting and the rest.

1080
01:49:20,216 --> 01:49:24,046
This is what I wanted to show you.

1081
01:49:24,216 --> 01:49:26,926
This is where we're gonna go as soon as you get well.

1082
01:49:27,636 --> 01:49:32,096
San Francisco,California.

1083
01:49:34,806 --> 01:49:37,476
You can have anything you want out there.

1084
01:49:37,646 --> 01:49:43,526
These men are pulling gold right out of the river with their own hands.

1085
01:49:45,326 --> 01:49:49,656
We're here,and we need to get there.

1086
01:49:50,406 --> 01:49:55,916
We start here,go down around here...

1087
01:49:57,996 --> 01:50:00,626
...to San Francisco.

1088
01:50:02,176 --> 01:50:04,216
Shortest way to go.

1089
01:50:05,006 --> 01:50:07,506
Would you go with me?

1090
01:50:32,156 --> 01:50:35,876
No need to fire that,miss. Or even aim it.

1091
01:50:36,376 --> 01:50:39,836
An audience with your mangled friend is all I want.

1092
01:50:55,226 --> 01:50:57,356
I got 44 notches in my club.

1093
01:50:59,646 --> 01:51:01,566
Do you know what they're for?

1094
01:51:03,736 --> 01:51:06,696
To remind me of what I owe God when I die.

1095
01:51:13,706 --> 01:51:16,536
My father was killed in battle too.

1096
01:51:17,206 --> 01:51:20,166
In Ireland,in the streets...

1097
01:51:21,876 --> 01:51:24,586
...fighting those who would take as their privilege...

1098
01:51:24,756 --> 01:51:29,046
...what could only be got and held by the decimation of a race.

1099
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:33,016
That war is 1000 years old or more.

1100
01:51:33,726 --> 01:51:36,596
We never expected it to follow us here.

1101
01:51:38,556 --> 01:51:40,606
It didn't.

1102
01:51:40,766 --> 01:51:43,436
It was waiting for us when we landed.

1103
01:51:47,106 --> 01:51:51,576
Your father tried to carve out a corner in this country for his tribe.

1104
01:51:53,326 --> 01:51:56,246
That was him. That was his Dead Rabbits.

1105
01:51:59,126 --> 01:52:02,746
I often wondered, if he'd lived a bit longer...

1106
01:52:03,586 --> 01:52:06,216
...would he have wanted a bit more?

1107
01:52:17,596 --> 01:52:20,856
Why'd you rifle through his pockets then?

1108
01:52:37,956 --> 01:52:40,376
For safekeeping.

1109
01:52:43,286 --> 01:52:45,706
I thought maybe you could do with it.

1110
01:53:07,316 --> 01:53:10,406
The blood stays on the blade.

1111
01:54:27,016 --> 01:54:29,186
That's a sorry-looking pelt.

1112
01:54:33,736 --> 01:54:37,736
And it's been so nice and quiet for the last three months.

1113
01:54:39,946 --> 01:54:43,536
Tell me,this charge, does it sit uneasy with you?

1114
01:54:44,706 --> 01:54:46,876
No,it's...

1115
01:54:47,786 --> 01:54:50,256
...not uneasy,Bill.

1116
01:54:51,046 --> 01:54:53,586
No,I wouldn't say that.

1117
01:54:55,546 --> 01:55:00,716
But my allegiance is to the law.

1118
01:55:01,766 --> 01:55:04,436
I'm paid to uphold the law.

1119
01:55:20,326 --> 01:55:23,826
What in heaven's name are you talking about?

1120
01:55:27,916 --> 01:55:30,666
You may have misgivings, but don't go believing that.

1121
01:55:30,836 --> 01:55:33,506
That way lies damnation.

1122
01:55:36,676 --> 01:55:39,756
I'm in no danger of damnation,Bill.

1123
01:55:50,976 --> 01:55:53,186
Here's the thing.

1124
01:55:54,276 --> 01:55:57,236
I don't give a tuppenny fuck about your moral conundrum...

1125
01:55:57,406 --> 01:56:00,366
...you meatheaded shit-sack.

1126
01:56:01,696 --> 01:56:04,446
That's more or less the thing.

1127
01:56:05,786 --> 01:56:08,956
And I want you to go out there... You,nobody else.

1128
01:56:09,126 --> 01:56:13,546
None of your little minions. I want you to go out there...

1129
01:56:13,706 --> 01:56:15,876
...and I want you...

1130
01:56:16,836 --> 01:56:20,716
...to punish the person...

1131
01:56:20,886 --> 01:56:23,386
...who's responsible...

1132
01:56:25,516 --> 01:56:30,226
...for murdering this poor little rabbit.

1133
01:56:36,236 --> 01:56:38,396
Is that understood?

1134
01:56:42,236 --> 01:56:44,036
Right.

1135
01:56:45,246 --> 01:56:48,866
Help yourself to some decent meat on the way out.

1136
01:57:25,986 --> 01:57:27,826
Damn it.

1137
01:57:29,496 --> 01:57:31,536
Is that you,boy?

1138
01:57:32,576 --> 01:57:35,086
I didn't mean nothing by that shot,you know.

1139
01:57:36,586 --> 01:57:39,336
You scared me is all.

1140
01:57:41,506 --> 01:57:44,426
Sure you know I'd never do you harm.

1141
01:57:45,256 --> 01:57:47,676
Come out now,lad.

1142
01:57:49,926 --> 01:57:52,686
Remember your father and me.

1143
01:57:55,766 --> 01:57:59,526
Are you too young to remember your old Uncle Jack?

1144
01:58:01,356 --> 01:58:04,026
Oh,the times we had.

1145
01:58:09,616 --> 01:58:12,036
You know I won't hurt you.

1146
01:58:33,686 --> 01:58:35,726
Is he dead?

1147
01:58:35,896 --> 01:58:39,316
I'm gonna get Andrew. Andrew,come see.

1148
01:58:39,526 --> 01:58:43,736
Andrew,come see,quick! Everybody,quick!

1149
01:58:43,906 --> 01:58:48,576
This is bad for everybody. What's next? Dead politicians?

1150
01:58:49,536 --> 01:58:54,666
I could spare half a dozen of you easier than I can spare him.

1151
01:58:55,416 --> 01:58:59,166
Still,I think it shows dash.

1152
01:58:59,336 --> 01:59:03,336
Give the boy some time. We'll settle with a good dustup.

1153
01:59:46,716 --> 01:59:50,216
There's more of us coming off these ships every day.

1154
01:59:50,886 --> 01:59:54,556
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.

1155
01:59:55,556 --> 01:59:58,016
And we're afraid of the Natives.

1156
02:00:00,016 --> 02:00:04,526
Get all of us together, we ain't got a gang. We got an army.

1157
02:00:04,686 --> 02:00:07,356
And all you need's a spark,right? Just one spark.

1158
02:00:07,526 --> 02:00:10,066
Something to wake us all up.

1159
02:00:26,626 --> 02:00:29,296
It was me played you false.

1160
02:00:31,136 --> 02:00:34,716
- I'd take it back if I could. - Take it back?

1161
02:00:38,306 --> 02:00:40,896
Johnny,I gotta kill you.

1162
02:00:54,656 --> 02:00:57,906
Get out of the Points and don't come back.

1163
02:01:05,416 --> 02:01:07,836
Where you going,boyo?

1164
02:01:08,836 --> 02:01:10,336
Come along.

1165
02:01:10,506 --> 02:01:12,346
Come on.

1166
02:01:14,756 --> 02:01:17,676
Tell us,John,what's the trouble?

1167
02:01:18,516 --> 02:01:20,306
No trouble,Bill.

1168
02:01:23,356 --> 02:01:25,976
Still hiding out with your friends?

1169
02:01:29,106 --> 02:01:33,776
No,I'm... I'm not with them,Bill.

1170
02:01:33,946 --> 02:01:37,076
I'm with you. I'm with the Natives.

1171
02:01:41,616 --> 02:01:45,876
You always was a Native as far as I'm interested,John...

1172
02:01:48,206 --> 02:01:51,126
...till you became a stag.

1173
02:01:54,546 --> 02:01:58,216
You tell me you're a Native. Do you want to know what a Native is?

1174
02:02:00,056 --> 02:02:03,556
A Native is a man...

1175
02:02:03,726 --> 02:02:08,436
...what's willing to give his life for his country...

1176
02:02:10,316 --> 02:02:12,656
...like my father done.

1177
02:02:15,736 --> 02:02:19,746
Are you willing to do that, my young friend?

1178
02:02:28,706 --> 02:02:31,926
John. Johnny!

1179
02:02:39,426 --> 02:02:41,426
Johnny?

1180
02:02:50,856 --> 02:02:52,856
John...

1181
02:03:05,116 --> 02:03:07,956
It hurts too much.

1182
02:03:14,006 --> 02:03:16,176
Just kill me.

1183
02:03:20,766 --> 02:03:23,176
Just kill me.

1184
02:03:24,766 --> 02:03:28,016
Please,please.

1185
02:03:35,526 --> 02:03:37,616
Please.

1186
02:03:39,826 --> 02:03:41,786
Please.

1187
02:03:45,866 --> 02:03:48,376
I'm sorry,Johnny.

1188
02:04:03,806 --> 02:04:07,766
Holy Mary,mother of God,pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.

1189
02:04:07,976 --> 02:04:09,896
Amen.

1190
02:04:10,646 --> 02:04:12,976
Rest in peace,Ma.

1191
02:04:15,696 --> 02:04:18,066
What're you doing here,boyo?

1192
02:04:24,326 --> 02:04:27,666
What's a nigger doing in this church?

1193
02:04:31,916 --> 02:04:34,166
What's a Dead Rabbit doing with the Natives?

1194
02:04:34,336 --> 02:04:37,506
There's no niggers in the Natives. Natives and Rabbits is one thing.

1195
02:04:37,676 --> 02:04:39,676
A nigger in the church is something else!

1196
02:04:39,886 --> 02:04:41,756
You run with the Natives, pray with them!

1197
02:04:41,926 --> 02:04:45,056
You're gonna wind up on a stake like your man did!

1198
02:04:45,806 --> 02:04:47,096
McGloin.

1199
02:04:47,266 --> 02:04:51,686
Father! Jesus,did you know there's a nigger in your church?

1200
02:05:09,706 --> 02:05:12,206
Jesus.

1201
02:05:34,686 --> 02:05:37,236
The earth turns...

1202
02:05:38,026 --> 02:05:40,736
...but we don't feel it move.

1203
02:05:43,366 --> 02:05:46,196
Then one night you look up.

1204
02:05:47,196 --> 02:05:52,416
One spark,and the sky is on fire.

1205
02:06:03,636 --> 02:06:06,556
It's a touching spectacle.

1206
02:06:08,266 --> 02:06:11,386
We'll come back when you're ready for us.

1207
02:06:17,646 --> 02:06:21,486
The past is the torch that lights our way.

1208
02:06:21,736 --> 02:06:27,156
Where our fathers have shown us the path,we shall follow.

1209
02:06:28,996 --> 02:06:33,326
Our faith is the weapon most feared by our enemies.

1210
02:06:33,626 --> 02:06:38,496
For thereby shall we lift our people up against those who would destroy us.

1211
02:06:38,666 --> 02:06:43,586
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits to remind all of our suffering...

1212
02:06:43,756 --> 02:06:47,636
...and as a call to those who suffer still tojoin our ranks...

1213
02:06:47,806 --> 02:06:52,596
...however so far they may have strayed from our common home across the sea.

1214
02:06:52,766 --> 02:06:56,436
For with great numbers must come great strength...

1215
02:06:58,186 --> 02:07:00,356
...and the salvation of our people.

1216
02:07:00,856 --> 02:07:03,236
- We don't want your business. - How many men live here?

1217
02:07:03,396 --> 02:07:05,946
- You have to register. - You can't force me to join.

1218
02:07:06,116 --> 02:07:07,826
- Have you got $300? - Of course not.

1219
02:07:07,986 --> 02:07:11,406
- Who's got $300? - Lf you are drafted,release from service...

1220
02:07:11,576 --> 02:07:14,996
...can only be secured for $300, according to the Conscription Act.

1221
02:07:15,166 --> 02:07:17,786
- Otherwise,you have to serve! - Who the hell's got $300?

1222
02:07:17,956 --> 02:07:21,626
You have to serve,sir, unless you have $300!

1223
02:07:21,796 --> 02:07:23,756
- Boys! - Go back to where you came from!

1224
02:07:23,926 --> 02:07:28,296
I'm born in this country. You immigrated here. You will fight for this country!

1225
02:07:28,466 --> 02:07:31,176
Sweet Jesus! War does terrible things to men.

1226
02:07:31,346 --> 02:07:37,356
- Get back uptown where you belong! - $300? So it's another rich man's war.

1227
02:07:37,516 --> 02:07:40,606
Sir,I request an audience with this man.

1228
02:07:42,646 --> 02:07:44,856
No one speak English in New York anymore?

1229
02:07:45,026 --> 02:07:47,116
- Don't understand. - You do speak English.

1230
02:07:49,076 --> 02:07:53,446
I wonder if Miss Everdeane could angle her rifle in some other direction.

1231
02:07:58,786 --> 02:08:03,546
I wonder,Mr. Vallon,if you understand the true value of this sort of publicity.

1232
02:08:07,466 --> 02:08:11,426
The archbishop himself,shoulder to shoulder with the Irish in the Five Points.

1233
02:08:11,966 --> 02:08:15,136
I'm offering to form an alliance with you against Bill Cutting...

1234
02:08:15,306 --> 02:08:18,056
...and his slate of Nativist candidates.

1235
02:08:18,226 --> 02:08:22,186
I'll negotiate a handsome fee for every Irish vote you send Tammany's way...

1236
02:08:22,396 --> 02:08:24,736
...in the coming elections.

1237
02:08:26,146 --> 02:08:29,316
I need a new friend in the Five Points,son.

1238
02:08:32,406 --> 02:08:34,826
I'd like that friend to be you.

1239
02:08:38,076 --> 02:08:40,746
Now,just a moment, Mr. Tweed.

1240
02:08:40,916 --> 02:08:44,126
Suppose we do get you those votes.

1241
02:08:46,466 --> 02:08:48,716
Would you back an Irish candidate of my choosing?

1242
02:08:48,926 --> 02:08:51,886
- I don't think so. - What if we get you all the Irish votes?

1243
02:08:52,176 --> 02:08:55,926
That will only happen in the reign of Queen Dick.

1244
02:08:57,886 --> 02:09:00,096
- Beg your pardon? - It will never happen.

1245
02:09:00,266 --> 02:09:03,726
I might be persuaded to back an Irish candidate for,say,alderman.

1246
02:09:03,896 --> 02:09:06,686
- Alderman? - We've already got Irish aldermen.

1247
02:09:06,856 --> 02:09:10,276
- So we have. That's why... - Well,what's bigger than alderman?

1248
02:09:11,696 --> 02:09:15,496
Sheriff. Sheriff. All right,Mr. Tweed.

1249
02:09:15,656 --> 02:09:19,616
You back an Irishman for sheriff of the city and county of New York...

1250
02:09:19,786 --> 02:09:21,166
...and we'll get him elected.

1251
02:09:21,326 --> 02:09:24,706
I love the Irish,but higher than alderman you shall never climb.

1252
02:09:24,876 --> 02:09:27,376
- Well,why not? - For one thing,no man living...

1253
02:09:27,546 --> 02:09:29,336
...can consolidate the Irish vote. - I can.

1254
02:09:29,506 --> 02:09:31,716
And for another, I mean no effrontery...

1255
02:09:31,886 --> 02:09:36,136
...no one's yet found an Irish candidate for sheriff worth voting for.

1256
02:09:38,516 --> 02:09:39,886
Monk.

1257
02:09:40,976 --> 02:09:42,266
Here.

1258
02:09:46,776 --> 02:09:49,446
He's to have me looking as sober as me own grandfather.

1259
02:09:49,606 --> 02:09:53,776
- Another great man,I'm sure. - A thorough drunken bastard.

1260
02:09:55,826 --> 02:09:57,576
Could I say what I want?

1261
02:09:58,746 --> 02:10:01,076
Well,that's why I wanted you.

1262
02:10:01,246 --> 02:10:04,166
Our elected representatives are a gang of thieves...

1263
02:10:04,336 --> 02:10:06,086
...who swear to better our lot...

1264
02:10:06,246 --> 02:10:09,166
...while dipping their hands deep into our pockets.

1265
02:10:09,336 --> 02:10:13,006
I stand shoulder to shoulder with community leaders like Bill Cutting...

1266
02:10:13,426 --> 02:10:17,346
...against any and all inroads into our fine democracy.

1267
02:10:17,516 --> 02:10:21,686
I'll see to it that no one takes away what you've earned by pluck and application.

1268
02:10:21,896 --> 02:10:23,936
- To invading hordes of Hibernians!

1269
02:10:24,106 --> 02:10:28,146
You go to the polls and you put your mark next to the name Walter McGinn.

1270
02:10:28,316 --> 02:10:32,986
- Against the potato eaters,like them over there,thieving our jobs!

1271
02:10:33,156 --> 02:10:35,526
Why should so many Irish die down south...

1272
02:10:35,696 --> 02:10:40,326
...when the first war to win is not down in Dixie,but right here in these streets?

1273
02:10:42,206 --> 02:10:44,956
And who's the finest street fighter in the Five Points?

1274
02:10:45,166 --> 02:10:47,336
- Monk! - That's right.

1275
02:10:47,496 --> 02:10:50,256
Now,let the whole damn city hear it!

1276
02:10:51,716 --> 02:10:53,506
That man was right born for this.

1277
02:10:53,676 --> 02:10:56,716
Well,he's killed 44 men, laid low a couple hundred more.

1278
02:10:56,886 --> 02:10:58,556
- Is that right? - That's right.

1279
02:10:58,766 --> 02:11:00,806
I should have run him for mayor.

1280
02:11:03,016 --> 02:11:06,306
All right,line them up. It's election day!

1281
02:11:06,806 --> 02:11:10,146
Not so fast, you little yellow bastard!

1282
02:11:10,396 --> 02:11:12,196
Come on!

1283
02:11:15,906 --> 02:11:17,906
Come on,you bastard, we need your vote.

1284
02:11:18,076 --> 02:11:21,496
Bastard? I fought for you,nigger. I lost an arm for you.

1285
02:11:21,656 --> 02:11:23,496
Well,that's a start. Now,come on.

1286
02:11:23,666 --> 02:11:25,416
Rise and shine. Rise and shine.

1287
02:11:25,626 --> 02:11:28,746
In this great country of ours, even the hop fiends get to vote!

1288
02:11:30,046 --> 02:11:31,916
Less art and more haste,Don.

1289
02:11:32,086 --> 02:11:34,546
- Where are you going? - I already voted today.

1290
02:11:34,716 --> 02:11:37,716
Cast for Monk and Tammany, by God. Twice.

1291
02:11:37,926 --> 02:11:41,716
Twice? Only twice? You call that doing your civic duty? Come with me.

1292
02:11:41,886 --> 02:11:44,516
Oh,no,you don't. Get back and sit down.

1293
02:11:44,686 --> 02:11:46,766
Here's another one. Clean him up good.

1294
02:11:46,936 --> 02:11:49,606
Shave their beards and send them back to vote again.

1295
02:11:49,816 --> 02:11:52,646
All right,boys. Vote Monk,Tammany. Monk,Tammany!

1296
02:11:52,816 --> 02:11:55,906
So,gentlemen,what our great city needs is a new courthouse.

1297
02:11:56,106 --> 02:11:58,946
I propose it should be a modest, economical structure.

1298
02:11:59,116 --> 02:12:00,906
Excuse me one moment.

1299
02:12:01,076 --> 02:12:04,616
Monk's already won by 3000 more votes than there are voters.

1300
02:12:04,786 --> 02:12:08,326
Three? Make it 20,30. We don't need a victory. We need a Roman triumph!

1301
02:12:08,496 --> 02:12:12,756
- But we don't have any more ballots. - Remember the first rule of politics:

1302
02:12:12,956 --> 02:12:16,296
The ballots don't make the results, the counters make the results.

1303
02:12:16,466 --> 02:12:17,586
Keep counting.

1304
02:12:49,496 --> 02:12:51,456
It's from Bill.

1305
02:12:54,876 --> 02:12:56,466
Monk.

1306
02:13:16,236 --> 02:13:19,196
Citizens of the Five Points...

1307
02:13:19,696 --> 02:13:23,616
...Mr. Bill Cutting is attempting to draw me into an argument...

1308
02:13:23,786 --> 02:13:28,366
...that would no doubt end in bloodshed and the compromising of my office.

1309
02:13:29,036 --> 02:13:30,996
What do you think?

1310
02:13:31,916 --> 02:13:35,586
Should I engage in silence this relic of the ancient law?

1311
02:13:35,756 --> 02:13:42,176
Or shall I be your chosen voice in a new testament,in the new world?

1312
02:13:48,136 --> 02:13:49,936
There you are,Bill.

1313
02:13:51,596 --> 02:13:53,566
The people have spoken.

1314
02:13:55,066 --> 02:13:59,146
The very notion of violent reprisal benumbs them.

1315
02:14:01,406 --> 02:14:03,066
Come on up.

1316
02:14:03,616 --> 02:14:07,076
Let's see if we can resolve our grievances the democratic way.

1317
02:14:30,306 --> 02:14:35,106
That,my friends, is the minority vote.

1318
02:14:36,146 --> 02:14:40,196
Now you've tasted my mutton. How do you like it?

1319
02:14:40,356 --> 02:14:41,776
Look.

1320
02:14:41,946 --> 02:14:44,446
I want you to see this.

1321
02:14:47,326 --> 02:14:49,406
This is you. Right here.

1322
02:14:49,576 --> 02:14:53,456
Notch 45,you Irish bog bastard.

1323
02:15:04,926 --> 02:15:08,426
Why don't you burn him, see if his ashes turn green.

1324
02:15:13,726 --> 02:15:16,106
Fortune favors the bold!

1325
02:15:28,536 --> 02:15:32,616
- You killed an elected official? - Who elected him?

1326
02:15:32,786 --> 02:15:35,956
You don't know what you've done to yourself.

1327
02:15:41,506 --> 02:15:44,006
I know your works.

1328
02:15:44,676 --> 02:15:46,836
You are neither cold nor hot.

1329
02:15:47,006 --> 02:15:51,306
So because you are lukewarm, I will spew you out of my mouth.

1330
02:15:52,886 --> 02:15:55,396
You can build your filthy world without me.

1331
02:15:55,556 --> 02:15:58,016
I took the father. Now I'll take the son.

1332
02:15:58,186 --> 02:16:03,106
You tell young Vallon I'm gonna paint Paradise Square with his blood.

1333
02:16:03,356 --> 02:16:04,946
Two coats.

1334
02:16:05,526 --> 02:16:08,196
I'll festoon my bedchamber with his guts.

1335
02:16:08,366 --> 02:16:10,866
As for you, Mr. Tammany-fucking-Hall...

1336
02:16:11,036 --> 02:16:12,906
...you come down to the Points again...

1337
02:16:13,076 --> 02:16:16,576
...and you'll be dispatched by mine own hand.

1338
02:16:18,376 --> 02:16:23,756
Now get back to your celebration and let me eat in peace. I paid you fair.

1339
02:16:47,566 --> 02:16:49,276
Stop.

1340
02:16:50,276 --> 02:16:51,866
Raise.

1341
02:17:34,986 --> 02:17:37,206
You son of a bitch!

1342
02:17:41,036 --> 02:17:43,036
Challenge.

1343
02:17:44,416 --> 02:17:46,796
Challenge accepted.

1344
02:18:38,516 --> 02:18:41,896
And then it came, the first day of the draft.

1345
02:18:42,056 --> 02:18:47,436
Thomas O'Neill. Andrew Lewis. Joseph Flynn.

1346
02:18:47,606 --> 02:18:50,856
They read out the draftees' names like they was dead already.

1347
02:18:51,026 --> 02:18:55,366
Andrew Martin. J.B. Gleason.

1348
02:18:55,526 --> 02:18:58,236
- The O'Connell Guard. - The Plug Uglies.

1349
02:18:58,406 --> 02:19:01,656
- As for us,the tribes were gathered. - Forty Thieves.

1350
02:19:01,996 --> 02:19:04,496
- The Chichesters. - The drums was beating.

1351
02:19:04,706 --> 02:19:05,996
The Dead Rabbits.

1352
02:19:06,166 --> 02:19:09,126
- The American Guard. - The Atlantic Guard.

1353
02:19:09,296 --> 02:19:11,966
- The Slaughter Housers. - The Bowery Boys.

1354
02:19:12,126 --> 02:19:14,466
The Confederation of American Natives.

1355
02:19:15,886 --> 02:19:17,056
James Mooney.

1356
02:19:17,216 --> 02:19:20,676
But all we could see was the hand in front of us.

1357
02:19:20,886 --> 02:19:22,846
Sean O'Connell.

1358
02:19:23,056 --> 02:19:27,186
G.W. Morris. John Doyle.

1359
02:19:27,396 --> 02:19:30,026
- When? - Whenever you like.

1360
02:19:30,236 --> 02:19:32,396
- Daybreak tomorrow. - Ground?

1361
02:19:32,566 --> 02:19:34,696
Paradise Square.

1362
02:19:34,906 --> 02:19:36,656
Weapons?

1363
02:19:36,816 --> 02:19:42,076
- That I leave up to you. - Bricks,bats,axes,knives...

1364
02:19:42,456 --> 02:19:43,866
Pistols?

1365
02:19:45,416 --> 02:19:46,876
No pistols.

1366
02:19:47,996 --> 02:19:50,046
Good boy.

1367
02:19:52,586 --> 02:19:55,636
The terms are resolved. The council's concluded.

1368
02:19:57,546 --> 02:20:01,596
Thomas McEvoy. W.H. Miles.

1369
02:20:01,766 --> 02:20:04,846
- To hell with your damned draft! - Give them hellfire,boys!

1370
02:20:05,016 --> 02:20:06,556
Rip them apart!

1371
02:20:13,606 --> 02:20:16,156
Kill the rich bastards!

1372
02:20:22,366 --> 02:20:23,996
Uptown!

1373
02:20:25,576 --> 02:20:27,376
You're not getting my son!

1374
02:20:32,956 --> 02:20:35,626
Uptown at the draft office...

1375
02:20:35,796 --> 02:20:40,806
...the cops broke a few skulls, and everybody run away.

1376
02:20:41,806 --> 02:20:44,226
But the word was spreading...

1377
02:20:44,386 --> 02:20:46,266
...and the dark.

1378
02:20:47,476 --> 02:20:48,806
Up on Fifth Avenue...

1379
02:20:48,976 --> 02:20:52,316
...the Schermerhorns and their mob breathed a little easy.

1380
02:20:52,526 --> 02:20:55,486
Just a brief burst of anger over Mr. Lincoln's draft.

1381
02:20:55,696 --> 02:20:57,906
Entirely justifiable in my view.

1382
02:20:58,066 --> 02:21:01,826
- There are two sides to that question... - There are several sides...

1383
02:21:01,986 --> 02:21:04,496
...but only one right side, as with any question...

1384
02:21:04,696 --> 02:21:06,956
...that involves the abuse of executive power.

1385
02:21:07,166 --> 02:21:09,456
In any case,Mr. Greeley...

1386
02:21:09,626 --> 02:21:12,336
...we can all be thankful that it wasn't any worse.

1387
02:21:12,546 --> 02:21:15,626
It may be worse yet. I saw them. I don't know what to think.

1388
02:21:15,836 --> 02:21:19,006
Now what is it that you are so fond of saying,Mr. Tweed?

1389
02:21:19,176 --> 02:21:21,636
Mr. Greeley,you won't like this. But what is it?

1390
02:21:21,796 --> 02:21:22,846
I don't remember.

1391
02:21:23,056 --> 02:21:27,766
"You can always hire one half of the poor to kill the other half."

1392
02:21:38,026 --> 02:21:40,366
I've come to say goodbye.

1393
02:21:40,526 --> 02:21:43,486
I've booked passage for California.

1394
02:21:45,996 --> 02:21:48,786
Jenny,give me one more day, and I'll go with you.

1395
02:21:48,956 --> 02:21:51,286
You'll be dead by then.

1396
02:21:51,826 --> 02:21:55,296
- Well,what would you have me do? - I don't know.

1397
02:21:57,916 --> 02:22:01,676
- This will all be finished tomorrow. - No,it won't.

1398
02:22:03,296 --> 02:22:04,846
No.

1399
02:22:05,266 --> 02:22:08,386
This whole place is gonna burn anyway.

1400
02:22:16,436 --> 02:22:21,196
I've heard that the poor are going from door to door in the Five Points...

1401
02:22:21,356 --> 02:22:24,906
...asking those supporters who wish to see further riots...

1402
02:22:25,076 --> 02:22:28,246
...to place a lighted candle in the window.

1403
02:22:28,616 --> 02:22:30,706
Irish,Poles,Germans,all of them.

1404
02:22:31,496 --> 02:22:37,706
Mr. Greeley,the city is not mad. I prophesy a very dark night.

1405
02:22:59,776 --> 02:23:03,776
Nobody goes to work today! We'll shut the factories down!

1406
02:23:03,946 --> 02:23:08,366
When the sun rose next, the city had split in half.

1407
02:23:08,536 --> 02:23:10,366
From all over New York they came:

1408
02:23:10,536 --> 02:23:13,366
Ironworkers,factory boys, street cleaners...

1409
02:23:13,536 --> 02:23:15,126
...Irish,Polish,German...

1410
02:23:15,336 --> 02:23:18,086
...anyone who never cared about slavery or the Union...

1411
02:23:18,296 --> 02:23:20,836
...anyone who couldn't buy his way out.

1412
02:23:21,006 --> 02:23:24,006
"Let the sons of the rich go and die," they cried.

1413
02:23:24,176 --> 02:23:27,216
"Let the sons of the poor stay home."

1414
02:23:28,636 --> 02:23:30,766
The earth was shaking now.

1415
02:23:30,926 --> 02:23:33,646
But I was about my father's business.

1416
02:23:38,726 --> 02:23:40,986
A bunch of Fifth Avenue scums!

1417
02:23:48,156 --> 02:23:52,616
Almighty Lord, you are the dagger in my hand.

1418
02:23:53,916 --> 02:23:56,326
Guide my hand on this day of vengeance.

1419
02:23:56,496 --> 02:24:00,456
We give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.

1420
02:24:00,626 --> 02:24:04,966

02:35:32,776 --> 02:35:37,616

1509
02:35:37,786 --> 02:35:41,996
...if they had any, could know them in the dark.

1510
02:35:43,206 --> 02:35:46,626

1513
02:36:19,236 --> 02:36:25,166
It was four days and nights before the worst of the mob was finally put down.

1514
02:36:26,246 --> 02:36:28,916
We never knew how many New Yorkers died that week...

1515
02:36:29,086 --> 02:36:31,916
...before the city was finally delivered.

1516
02:36:33,256 --> 02:36:38,346
My father told me we was all born of blood and tribulation.

1517
02:36:39,466 --> 02:36:43,766
And so then too was our great city.

1518
02:36:46,686 --> 02:36:51,436
But for those of us what lived and died in them furious days...

1519
02:36:51,606 --> 02:36:57,066
...it was like everything we knew was mightily swept away.

1520
02:36:57,866 --> 02:37:00,986
And no matter what they did to build the city up again...

1521
02:37:03,286 --> 02:37:05,916
...for the rest of time...

1522
02:37:06,876 --> 02:37:11,166
...it would be like no one even knew we was ever here.
