2
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:51,363
No, son. Never.

3
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:54,847
The blood stays on the blade.

4
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,796
One day you'll understand.

5
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,642
Some of it I half remember.

6
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,078
And the rest...

7
00:01:13,647 --> 00:01:16,286
The rest I took from dreams.

8
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:23,003
St. Michael, the archangel,
defend us in battle.

9
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,558
Be our protector against the snares...

10
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:31,164
...and the wickedness of the devil.

11
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,079
Now, son, who's that?

12
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:34,919
- St. Michael.
- Who is it?

13
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:36,918
- St. Michael!
- And what did he do?

14
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,760
He cast Satan out of paradise.

15
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:42,004
Good boy.

16
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:52,160
May God put the steel
of the Holy Spirit in your spine...

17
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:55,080
...and the love of the Blessed Virgin
in your heart.

18
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,364
- Hey, boyo!
- Johnny.

19
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:26,325
- Wha�s the battle?
- Natives against the Dead Rabbits.

20
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:30,002
- Which are you?
- What do you think? Dead Rabbits.

21
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,762
Well, well, Monk.

22
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:12,918
Are you with us or not?

23
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,159
For the last time, Vallon,
I'm with you if the money is right.

24
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:19,960
I'll give you 10 per notch.

25
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:23,637
- Ten?
- You have my word.

26
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:31,316
- Ten per notch?
- Per new notch.

27
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:36,639
Then I'm your man.

28
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,766
Is this it, Priest?
The pope's new army?

29
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:27,158
A few crusty bitches
and a handful of ragtags?

30
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,717
Now, now, Bill, you swore this was
a battle between warriors...

31
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:33,117
...not a bunch of Miss Nancys.

32
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:36,006
So warriors is what I brought.

33
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,160
The O'Connell Guard.

34
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:41,760
The Plug Uglies.

35
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,282
The Shirt Tails.

36
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,559
The Chichesters.

37
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,400
The forty Thieves.

38
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,487
On my challenge...

39
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:17,205
...by the ancient laws of combat,
we have met at this chosen ground...

40
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,676
...to settle, for good and all...

41
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:23,635
...who holds sway over the Five Points:

42
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:29,439
Us Natives, born right-wise
to this fine land...

43
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:32,326
...or the foreign hordes defiling it.

44
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:41,636
By the ancient laws of combat, I accept
the challenge of the so-called Natives.

45
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:44,116
You plague our people at every turn.

46
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:47,040
But from this day out,
you shall plague us no more.

47
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:50,836
For let it be known that the hand
that tries to strike us from this land...

48
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,645
...shall be swiftly cut down.

49
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:58,037
Then may the Christian Lord
guide my hand...

50
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,357
...against your Roman popery!

51
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:03,200
Prepare to receive the true Lord!

52
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:03,038
Priest!

53
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:51,436
Look to me.

54
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,685
Who is this under my knife?

55
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,756
Father, get up. Get up!

56
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:09,363
Where are you? Where are you?

57
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:12,126
Oh, my son.

58
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,802
Don't never look away.

59
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,247
Soon be over, Priest.

60
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,078
Finish it.

61
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:52,165
You may need this across the river.

62
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:04,003
Ears and noses will be
the trophies of the day.

63
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,482
But no hand shall touch him!

64
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:13,206
No hand shall touch him!

65
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,681
He'll cross over whole...

66
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:20,285
...in honor.

67
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:23,041
Not before I get wha�s owed.

68
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:31,318
No!

69
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:36,639
L�s fair. A touch indelicate, but fair.

70
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,998
My sympathies.

71
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,445
What will we do with the boy?

72
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:47,957
Look at me.

73
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,999
Give him to the law.

74
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,761
See he gets a good education.

75
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:01,240
Okay, boy, say goodbye to your father.

76
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:10,123
- Get him!
- Get him!

77
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,440
Don't let him get away.

78
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:14,996
Hurry, come in here!

79
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,645
He's going downstairs.

80
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,561
Come here, boy.

81
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,525
- You're going to Hellgate, son.
- There he is. Get him.

82
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,565
- Priest Vallon died a noble death...
- Let go of me!

83
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:46,926
...but his Dead Rabbits
is done and outlawed!

84
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:53,476
Let no one even speak their name
from this time on.

85
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:41,606
In this place, you have grown
from a boy into a man.

86
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,916
Put to death the earthly things in you:
Immorality, impurity...

87
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,601
...passion, vengeance.

88
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:52,964
The Lord has forgiven you.

89
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:56,324
You also must forgive.

90
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:59,647
You go forth to a country torn apart
by civil strife.

91
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,838
Thank you, Reverend.

92
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:09,440
Lend your hand to the work
that yet remains...

93
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:11,723
...that this war may end...

94
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:15,118
...and the plague of slavery
that brought this conflagration...

95
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:20,486
...down upon us vanish forever
from the earth.

96
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,678
In the second year of the Civil War...

97
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:54,315
...when the Irish Brigade
marched in the streets...

98
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,399
...New York was a city full of tribes...

99
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,798
...war chiefs, rich and poor.

100
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:04,596
- Down with Lincoln!
- Lincoln will make all white men slaves.

101
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,400
It wasn 't a city really.

102
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,842
It was more a furnace where a city
someday might be forged.

103
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,599
Tha�s the spirit, boys.

104
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:17,919
- Go off and die for your blackie friends.
- Down with the abolitionists!

105
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:21,124
We shoul�ve run a better man against
Lincoln when we had the chance.

106
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,039
New York should secede
from the Union!

107
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,846
They trying to say we're
no different than niggers?

108
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:28,805
You ain't. Good evening, brother.

109
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,124
- Praise the Union.
- The Union forever!

110
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:34,006
Go back to Africa, nigger!

111
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:37,280
- Go back to Africa!
- Leave him alone. We're free.

112
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:40,405
The angriest talk was of the
new Conscription Act...

113
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,319
...the first draft in Union history.

114
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:58,402
Join the Army, lads. Three square meals
a day and good pay in your pocket.

115
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,843
When the Irish came,
the city was in a fever.

116
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:06,398
Since the time of the great famine,
they'd come streaming off the boats.

117
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,239
And they got a right warm welcome.

118
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,683
- Go back to Ireland, you dumb micks!
- Remember that, you Irish gyps!

119
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:13,678
Get back on the boat, Paddy!

120
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:17,399
I only came two hours downriver
from Hellgate.

121
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,842
But they all took me for an immigrant.

122
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,965
Why not? There were a thousand
different accents in New York.

123
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:27,643
And to the Natives, you see,
we was all the same.

124
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:35,963
Welcome to America, son.
Your long, arduous journey is over.

125
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:38,402
- Go back to your own country!
- Vote Tammany!

126
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:49,926
New York loved William Tweed
and hated him.

127
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:54,205
And those of us trying to be thieves,
well, we couldn 't help but admire him.

128
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,718
Mr. Cutting, gentlemen,
thank you for coming. L�s an honor.

129
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,684
Mr. Tweed.

130
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:03,837
Sir, please. Excuse me.

131
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,317
- I think you're frightening them.
- So?

132
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:10,082
Don't mind him.
He used to be an Irishman.

133
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:13,125
Ah, the Five Points.

134
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:18,276
Murderers ' Alley. Brickbat Mansion.
The Gates of Hell.

135
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:24,079
Here in this vile place.
Look upon the face of this poor child.

136
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:26,761
She lives in squalor...

137
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:31,125
...in this godforsaken den
of vice and misery behind me.

138
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,876
Every year the reformers came.

139
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,685
Every year the Points got worse...

140
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:39,679
...as if it liked being dirty.

141
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:43,724
- Where am I going to go?
- The Reverend wants you out of here.

142
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:46,037
You can't do this!

143
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,037
A glorious resurrection will spring
from the filthy depths...

144
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,517
...to which these miserable creatures
have fallen.

145
00:18:54,687 --> 00:18:57,281
In God, they will find their true home.

146
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:00,917
You may or may not know, Bill,
that every day I go to the waterfront...

147
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,647
...with hot soup for the Irish
as they come ashore.

148
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,798
L�s part of building a political base.

149
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,765
I've noticed you there.
You may have noticed me.

150
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,044
Indeed I have. Throwing torrents
of pavers and withering abuse...

151
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:15,643
...on everyone stepping off those boats.
- Lf only I had the guns...

152
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:20,437
...I'd shoot each and every one of them
before they set foot on American soil.

153
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,236
Mulberry Street...

154
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,639
...and Worth.

155
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:54,358
Cross and Orange and Little Water.

156
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,325
Each of the Five Points is a finger.

157
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,639
When I close my hand,
it becomes a fist.

158
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:05,720
And any time that I wish,
I can turn it against you.

159
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:08,037
I know, but we're talking
about different things.

160
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,517
I'm talking about civic duty,
responsibilities we owe to the people.

161
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:14,440
Schools and hospitals,
sewers and utilities.

162
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,837
Street construction,
repairs and sweeping.

163
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,157
Business licenses, saloon licenses...

164
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:43,839
St. Michael, the archangel,
defend us in battle.

165
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:47,682
Be our protector against the snares
and the wickedness of the devil.

166
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,361
Street cars, ferries, rubbish disposal.

167
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:53,280
There's a power of money
to be made in this city, Bill.

168
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:57,326
With your help, the people
must be made to understand...

169
00:20:57,487 --> 00:21:01,400
...that all these things are best kept
within the Tammany family...

170
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,683
...which is why I'm proposing
an alliance...

171
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,156
...between our two great organizations.

172
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:10,479
- You're talking about muscle work.
- That too. Muscle to match our spirit.

173
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:12,444
You own the crushers.
Get them to do it.

174
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:14,484
The police? Oh, no. Jesus, no!

175
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:18,322
The appearance of the law
must be upheld...

176
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,921
...especially while i�s being broken.

177
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:35,203
Give me the strength
for what I must do.

178
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:39,839
Who are you?

179
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,044
- Hey!
- No!

180
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:47,324
I said, who are you?
What are you doing here?

181
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,365
I just like it down here is all.

182
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:00,476
See wha�s in his pockets, Jimmy.

183
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:04,003
- Look, boys, I really don't want a fight.
- Don't want a fight?

184
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:07,284
Don't worry, son,
ain't gonna be much a fight.

185
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,998
Don't kill me.

186
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:25,598
Where'd you get that?

187
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:28,076
I told you I didn't want a fight!

188
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,841
Why not? Look how good you done.

189
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:42,478
- You're the Pries�s son, aren't you?
- You, get away from me, understand?

190
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:47,118
You don't remember me, do you?
I's the one tried to help you.

191
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:51,685
- What?
- I's the one tried to help you...

192
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:54,077
...when the Natives took you.

193
00:22:57,527 --> 00:23:02,317
- Oh, that was you?
- Yeah. I thought you was killed.

194
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,838
They just locked me up,
you know that?

195
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:08,918
This long?

196
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:13,717
Well, I kept trying to escape, you know.
They add on time for that.

197
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,241
So, what are you doing back here?

198
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:19,843
I guess I missed the place.

199
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,079
Bowery Boys.

200
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:41,406
Get back here!

201
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,286
The Five Points, Paradise Square.

202
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:47,359
The streets here are always lively
of an evening.

203
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,965
Who are the gangs around now?

204
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,004
The Daybreak Boys
and the Swamp Angels.

205
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,237
They work the river, looting ships.

206
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:57,001
The frog Hollows shanghai sailors
by the Bloody Angle.

207
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,523
The Shirt Tails was rough,
but they've become a bunch of dandies...

208
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:03,485
...Iolling around Murderers' Alley,
looking like Chinamen.

209
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:06,321
Hell-Cat Maggie, she tried to open
her own grog shop.

210
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,001
She drunk her own liquor
and got throwed on the street.

211
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:11,601
- Beautiful.
- Now she's on the lay for anything.

212
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:14,201
The Plug Uglies are from deep
in the old country.

213
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,517
Got their own language
no one understands.

214
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,918
They love to fight the cops.
The Night Walkers of Ragpicker's Row.

215
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,927
They work on their backs
and kill with their hands.

216
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:26,682
They're so scurvy only the Plug Uglies
talk to them. But who understands them?

217
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:29,282
The Slaughter Housers
and the Broadway Twisters.

218
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:32,439
They're a fine bunch of bingo boys.
And the Little forty Thieves.

219
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:33,960
I used to run with them...

220
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:36,925
...till they got took over
by Bendrick the Cockroach.

221
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:38,520
Bendrick carries a germ.

222
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,485
If you try to leave the gang,
he hacks up blood on you.

223
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,923
The lime-juicers are nothing but
a bunch of rapacious grab-ups.

224
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,842
The True Blue Americans
say they're a gang...

225
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:50,646
...but all they do is stand on corners
damning England.

226
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:53,958
If you believe one word
the British say, you're a fool.

227
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:57,324
Do any of them got the sand
of the Dead Rabbits?

228
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:02,877
You don't say that name.

229
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:07,518
That name died with your...
They been outlawed.

230
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,918
In the blockhouse,
the Chinks told me...

231
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:14,239
...that the Natives celebrate their victory
every year. Is that true?

232
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:17,161
Aye, that they do. L�s quite the affair.

233
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:20,080
The Butcher himself's got to invite you,
or you don't go.

234
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:33,045
Look where you're going, Johnny.

235
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:38,406
You look stunned and poorly, sir.

236
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:45,604
Quite a pair of conversationists,
aren't you?

237
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:51,197
Maybe not, but we're deep thinkers.

238
00:25:54,407 --> 00:26:00,323
Well, gentlemen, I leave you
in the grace and favor of the Lord.

239
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:09,687
Jenny, the finest bludget
in all the Points.

240
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:12,315
She is a prim-looking stargazer.

241
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,116
But I'd check my pockets if I was you...

242
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:20,404
...because I do believe she lifted
your timepiece.

243
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,556
Well, I let her take it.

244
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:29,366
I let her take things all the time.

245
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:32,281
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

246
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,956
We always liked a good fire
in the Points.

247
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:45,605
You could pick up a little swag. And
if the cops came, you really got a show.

248
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:49,043
The Municipal Police fought
the Metropolitan Police.

249
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,846
The Metropolitan Police,
they fought the street gangs.

250
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:54,316
Hurry up, men,
before the Black Joke get there!

251
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:58,082
There were 37 amateur fire brigades,
and they all fought each other.

252
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:03,924
The Black Joke are on their way, Tweed,
and they'll beat the shite out of you.

253
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:11,844
Okay, boys, get the hose out!

254
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:19,275
L�s the Black Joke!

255
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,756
Go get them, boys!

256
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,762
Give those Bowery Boys hell!

257
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:28,397
- Quick, before there's nothing left.
- Go back to the Bowery, you bums!

258
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,286
Stop them. For Go�s sake,
they're taking everything!

259
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:34,086
In your next time of trouble,
call on Tammany first.

260
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:37,444
But i�s not too late.
You can still save my house.

261
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:39,679
Le�s go.

262
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:43,205
I thought you said you was hungry.

263
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:49,877
Grab what you can, Johnny.
Le�s get out of here.

264
00:27:50,527 --> 00:27:53,280
May I point out that this building
is burning to ashes?

265
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:57,599
May I point out this area is the province
of my own Americus fire Brigade...

266
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:01,077
...and that you lot belong
only in the Bowery?

267
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:05,119
May I point out that you're outmanned,
outmaneuvered...

268
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:07,323
...and, in a moment, outfought?

269
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:09,239
Am I?

270
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:17,884
There's the Black Joke!
Le�s take them on the cobbles.

271
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:22,245
Go spill some claret, boys.
Go on, Shorty, have a nice muss.

272
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:24,967
Clear the way for Bill the Butcher.

273
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:27,197
Okay, boys, to work.

274
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:31,836
Wha�s the point? The fire's near burned
anything of value inside.

275
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:35,158
Boys, forget that one.
Next building over.

276
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:38,046
Mustn't let it spread.
Take what you want from that one.

277
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:39,196
What are you doing?

278
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,040
There's nothing wrong with this one.
This is my house.

279
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:47,126
- Johnny!
- Help!

280
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:49,676
- Johnny!
- Help!

281
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:53,720
Help! Help!

282
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,245
Help!

283
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:05,117
Come on. Come on, Johnny, get up.

284
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,398
Leave that!

285
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,760
You two, out of the way!

286
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:34,563
His name's Amsterdam.

287
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,845
- How's the beak?
- Ain't so bad.

288
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:43,920
You. You got anything,
you give it up or you get out.

289
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,484
Is that it?

290
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:58,758
Tha�s it.

291
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:03,364
Right. Here's the rake.
Everything comes here. We fence it.

292
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:06,837
Johnny takes our tribute to the Natives,
and we chop up the winnings...

293
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:10,363
...each to his equal portion,
amongst the gang.

294
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:13,883
Does that meet
with your approval, Hellgate?

295
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:15,605
My approval?

296
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,520
Wha�s the matter, Jack Sprat?
Can't think for yourself?

297
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:23,000
- I'll slit your fucking throat!
- Hey, come on!

298
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,316
Hey!

299
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:31,521
You boys will settle with me
before settling with each other.

300
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:37,446
I come for my due and proper.

301
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:57,677
Well, this ain't a bad haul.

302
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:01,557
When folks start in to saying
to where the country is going to hell...

303
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,560
...I always tell them,
"You just look at all the hard work...

304
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:08,003
...our fine young lads is doing
down in the Five Points."

305
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:12,046
Oh, yeah. Now this is just
the thing for Mrs. Mulraney.

306
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:14,437
All right there, Happy Jack,
leave us something...

307
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,882
...to quarter to Bill the Butcher, eh?

308
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:18,560
Would you?

309
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:32,161
Not my favorite tune.

310
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:41,197
Thank you, boys.

311
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:44,605
You keep out of trouble now.

312
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:05,886
Every year the Natives celebrated
the killing of my father all over again...

313
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:12,316
...at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda
in Mott Street.

314
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:16,002
The Chinks hated the Natives
worse than we did.

315
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:22,879
The drum rolls, and the Butcher
drinks a glass of fire.

316
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:29,156
When you kill a king...

317
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:32,520
...you don 't stab him in the dark.

318
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:38,915
You kill him where the whole court
can watch him die.

319
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:45,121
Hey, you got any timber?

320
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:36,722
- Hey, Maggie. Right ear or left ear?
- Give us a drink, you idiot.

321
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:38,445
Help yourself.

322
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,404
- Final bets!
- To health.

323
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:43,525
Place your bets.
Betting closes in two minutes.

324
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:44,915
Place your bets.

325
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:49,080
Gentlemen, the match
is due to commence.

326
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:52,637
The count to beat is 25 rodents
in three minutes.

327
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:55,002
Towser against the vermin.

328
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,805
- Are the enumerators satisfied?
- Fifty!

329
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,003
- Yes!
- Let them go!

330
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:15,279
- Where you going, boy?
- I'm here to pay tribute to Bill.

331
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,756
Are you now? Give it to me.
I'll give it to him.

332
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:20,600
No, thanks. I'll give it to him myself.

333
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,556
What do you want to keep,
the money or your teeth?

334
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:26,365
John.

335
00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:28,799
Welcome.

336
00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:38,887
From me and me lads, sir.

337
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:48,398
Mate of yours? Where's he from?

338
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:51,202
Oh, he's not from here, sir.

339
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,405
You.

340
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:14,157
Tha�s close enough.

341
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:29,118
Your friend can't look me in the eye.
Tha�s not an admirable characteristic.

342
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:33,041
No one can look you in the eye, Bill.
Not when you're playing cards.

343
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:54,402
This is whist. L�s a gentleman's game.
Make a gentleman's bet.

344
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:58,840
- I'm betting large, Bill.
- That ain't large.

345
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,004
Please, don't make that noise again,
Harvey.

346
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:15,603
I like a man who's willing
to burn for his swag.

347
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:21,407
How do you fare on water?
Come closer.

348
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:24,764
Close, John. I ain't gonna bite. Close.

349
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:31,840
There's a Portuguese ship lying low
in the harbor, quarantined three weeks.

350
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:34,077
Get there before
the Daybreak Boys strip her...

351
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:35,839
...maybe you and me will talk more.

352
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:38,441
- Consider it done, sir.
- Good boy.

353
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:43,042
And you, whatever your name is...
What is your name?

354
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:52,676
- Amsterdam, sir.
- Amsterdam. I'm New York.

355
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:55,321
Don't you never come in here
empty-handed again.

356
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:58,718
You gotta pay for the pleasure
of my company.

357
00:36:58,887 --> 00:37:00,718
Take him for a boat ride, John.

358
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,879
Who knows, but he might
save your life again.

359
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:10,040
The Daybreak Boys catch us,
they'll slit our throats.

360
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:12,801
I'll do it myself in a minute
if you don't keep quiet.

361
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,004
I never liked the harbor after dark.

362
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,398
And now each night they brung ashore
the bodies of the soldiers.

363
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,398
Many mothers have not
even the solace...

364
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,842
...of knowing where
their sons have fallen.

365
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:26,601
I lost my own eldest at Antietam.

366
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:29,281
His mother and I were unable
to recover his remains.

367
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,041
- It was a mournful sight.
- The war can't last forever.

368
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,801
But we had business of our own.

369
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:47,957
The Daybreak Boys have been here,
and there's nothing left. Le�s go back.

370
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:53,881
What the hell?

371
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,483
Jimmy, get down!

372
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:08,316
Jesus, tha�ll bring the harbor cops
for sure. Fuck off.

373
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:17,723
Le�s take a look.

374
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:22,557
Jesus, they killed everybody.

375
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:25,446
There's nothing here but a bunch
of dead sea-crabs.

376
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,802
Come on, le�s go.

377
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:31,682
- Shove off.
- No, wait for Amsterdam.

378
00:38:31,847 --> 00:38:33,917
Where's Amsterdam?

379
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:38,721
- No, you damn fool, take him!
- What in the hell for?!

380
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:40,923
Look in my glims.
I said no less than 15.

381
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:44,318
- Is this fresh?
- Four hours most.

382
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:47,115
Much obliged, gents.

383
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:55,923
Wha�s that word?

384
00:38:56,807 --> 00:38:59,037
- It means body snatchers.
- I didn't ask the meaning.

385
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:00,481
I asked the word.

386
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:02,560
Ghoul.

387
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:07,323
Ghoul? Tha�s a good word.

388
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:13,562
"Ghoul Gang Slaughters.
A fresh Outrage in the Five Points."

389
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,082
- Tha�s a notice you can be proud of.
- Thank you.

390
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:19,842
A low thing, to do that to a body.
Low.

391
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,202
Why? They could have left
that ship with nothing.

392
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:26,406
Instead they made The Police Gazette,
a periodical of note.

393
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,842
A body's supposed to stay
beneath the earth...

394
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:32,044
...wearing a wooden coat
until the Resurrection.

395
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:35,040
These two are a pair of sons
of Irish bitches, same as you.

396
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,163
It don't seem to bother them none.

397
00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:40,125
But then maybe they don't share
your religious scruples.

398
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:42,960
Maybe they're just a couple
of fidlam Bens.

399
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:52,161
I've been called a lot of things, mister,
but I ain't never been called...

400
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:55,842
- fidlam Bens.
- Fidlam Bens. Right.

401
00:39:56,007 --> 00:40:02,116
Well, if I knew what in the hell that
meant, I'd be inclined to take offense.

402
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:06,360
A fidlam Bens is a fellow
who steals anything, dead or alive...

403
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:09,439
...because he's too low to work up
a decent lay for himself.

404
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,802
Count that careful, Bill.
Count that careful.

405
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,879
- I'm telling you, tha�s all there is...
- Now, chiseler...

406
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:18,437
If you'd said "chiseler," now there's
a word I understand. You know?

407
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:22,566
- Now, is that what you're calling us?
- I can think of many things to call you.

408
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:25,878
Right. But I asked
if you was calling us chiselers.

409
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:28,686
Supposing I am?

410
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:33,127
Well, then we got business.

411
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:36,202
That we do.

412
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:45,560
- A fight! There's a fight!
- Two bucks on McGloin.

413
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:48,082
- Four bits on the kid.
- Five bits on the kid.

414
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:51,000
I got two on Amsterdam.

415
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:02,403
Come on, McGloin, he's just a kid.

416
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:05,435
Four bits to back Amsterdam.

417
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:14,645
Watch his left, McGloin. Watch his left.

418
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:55,639
- All right, tha�ll do. Tha�ll do.
- Anything to say now, huh?!

419
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,321
Tha�ll do, for chrissake.
Drag him off.

420
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:01,524
- Tha�s enough, kid.
- You got him. Come on, kid, you won.

421
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:04,406
McGloin. He's a kid too, McGloin.

422
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:07,035
You're getting too old for it, McGloin.

423
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:32,960
McGloin, how would that head look
without the ears and the nose on it?

424
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,476
You'd better leave
that head alone, Bill.

425
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:40,003
I think I'm gonna trim the ears
and the beak off of that head.

426
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:43,357
Make a nice pot of soup of that head.

427
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,166
You could find a tastier head
than that, Bill.

428
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:49,603
I ain't got the stomach for no Irish stew.

429
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:56,802
The mighty McGloin
almost fishhooked by a sprat.

430
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:09,120
On the seventh day, the Lord rested,
but before that he did...

431
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:14,919
...he squatted over the side of England,
and what came out of him was Ireland.

432
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:18,966
- No offense, son.
- Oh, none taken, sir. I grew up here.

433
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:23,484
All I ever knew of Ireland was in the
talk of the others at the orphan asylum.

434
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:28,402
In which part of that excrementitious
isle were your forebears spawned?

435
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:33,960
I've been told Kerry, but I lost proof
of it in my language at the asylum.

436
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:37,278
I was raised in a very similar
establishment myself.

437
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:40,723
Now everything you see belongs to me,
to one degree or another.

438
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:43,845
The beggars and newsboys
and quick thieves here in Paradise.

439
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:47,397
The sailor dives and gin mills
and blind tigers on the waterfront.

440
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:50,400
The anglers and amusers,
the she-hes and the Chinks.

441
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:52,319
Everybody owes, everybody pays...

442
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:58,119
...because tha�s how you stand up
against the rising of the tide.

443
00:43:58,287 --> 00:44:01,404
- Is that right, boys?
- Yeah, Bill. Tha�s right.

444
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:03,637
Enlist. Join up. Serve your country.

445
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:07,120
Come on in out of the draft, boys.

446
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:09,437
Volunteer and get your $50 bonus.

447
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:15,365
We need 30,000 volunteers, and we're
prepared to pay $677 per volunteer.

448
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,757
- Please read this. Thank you.
- Thanks.

449
00:44:17,927 --> 00:44:20,282
Would you like to take
one of these to fill out?

450
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:23,837
Three square meals a day.
Three square meals a day.

451
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:26,680
Young man, enlist
and serve your country.

452
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:28,724
Three square meals a day, gentlemen.

453
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:31,447
If you're interested,
read this and consider joining.

454
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:34,326
Everywhere you went
people talked about the draft.

455
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:37,559
Now, you could buy
your way out for $300...

456
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:39,718
...but who had $300?

457
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:42,560
For us it might as well
have been 3 million.

458
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:46,561
The recruiters? They was too scared
of the gangs to come after us.

459
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:51,357
Besides, we never dreamt the war
would ever touch New York.

460
00:44:51,527 --> 00:44:52,880
Good morning, sir.

461
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:56,166
You!

462
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:58,245
Don't you run into me.

463
00:44:59,527 --> 00:45:01,199
Fair enough.

464
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:07,843
I said, don't run into me!

465
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:10,077
Well, sorry.

466
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,878
- Everything in place?
- It seems so.

467
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:21,880
Well, then I leave you
in the grace and favor of the Lord.

468
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,117
- Thank you.
- Tha�s right.

469
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:34,564
Oh, the dirty mab!

470
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:39,600
Oh, no.

471
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:42,122
- I'm sorry.
- Allow me.

472
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,683
- Thank you kindly, sir.
- Oh, i�s my pleasure.

473
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:50,523
I hope you won't think
me rude if I speak.

474
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:52,803
I wouldn't want to appear forward.

475
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:57,597
Well, sir, that depends
on what you say.

476
00:46:05,207 --> 00:46:09,439
Would you call me reckless if I said
you were the prettiest girl in New York?

477
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:12,201
Only New York?

478
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:15,161
This is my stop.

479
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,085
May I walk with you a little then?

480
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,886
That, sir, would be too bold.

481
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:40,882
Good morning.

482
00:46:48,967 --> 00:46:52,323
For every lay we had a different name.

483
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:54,682
An "angler" put a hook
on the end of a stick...

484
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:57,839
...to drop behind
store windows and doors.

485
00:46:58,007 --> 00:47:01,443
An "autumn diver"
picked your pocket in church.

486
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:04,041
A "badger" gets a fellow
into bed with a girl...

487
00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:07,040
...then robs his pockets
while they're on the go.

488
00:47:07,527 --> 00:47:11,122
Jenny was a "bludget,"
a girl pickpocket...

489
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:15,041
...and a "turtledove."

490
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:19,719
A turtledove goes uptown
dressed like a housemaid...

491
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:23,482
...picks out a fine house
and goes right through the back door.

492
00:47:23,887 --> 00:47:25,115
Robs you blind.

493
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:30,158
It takes a lot of sand
to be a turtledove.

494
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:55,155
I'll have my medal back. Oh, Jesus!

495
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:03,398
Don't do that again.

496
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,286
Listen! I said, don't do that...

497
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,963
Go back to the Points
and leave me to my business...

498
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:11,960
...or I will open your throat,
so help me God.

499
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:17,044
All right.

500
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,444
Go on then.

501
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,398
I would.

502
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:27,206
Go on then.

503
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:51,167
Now give me back my medal.

504
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,677
Make it quick!

505
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:03,360
I don't know which one's yours.

506
00:49:09,687 --> 00:49:11,962
Suppose I help myself to everything?

507
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:16,319
Suppose you do.

508
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:56,560
May I walk with you a little then?

509
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:07,361
What do you suppose a fellow
could earn here in a day?

510
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:10,724
- Maybe we could pal in together.
- Oh, I think you're a bit...

511
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:15,324
...rough for this sort of game.
Besides, I work alone.

512
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,285
Alone? Well, what do you quarter
to the Butcher?

513
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,642
- Me? Nothing.
- Nothing?

514
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:23,196
The Butcher and me
have a special arrangement.

515
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:34,042
- I don't want to see you again.
- Well, I don't blame you.

516
00:50:34,847 --> 00:50:37,441
Pennies in their pockets
and hope in their eyes...

517
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:39,598
...they peer to the west...

518
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:44,158
...searching the horizon
for a glimpse of land and salvation.

519
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,400
A glimpse of America.

520
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:50,764
Seeing all this poverty must be
most unsettling, Miss Schermerhorn.

521
00:50:50,927 --> 00:50:54,397
Some days, of course,
the uptown gangs come down to us.

522
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:58,482
The Schermerhorns was one
of the oldest families in New York.

523
00:50:58,647 --> 00:51:00,160
They didn 't run the city...

524
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:02,636
...but they was listened
to carefully by them that did.

525
00:51:02,807 --> 00:51:04,525
Commissioner Brunt
said you wished to view...

526
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,962
...the Points in all
its splendor and squalor.

527
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:09,277
"Spare nothing concerning
the conditions," said he.

528
00:51:09,447 --> 00:51:12,245
Yeah, nothing except
our safety, constable.

529
00:51:12,407 --> 00:51:15,843
I'm sure we can be in no danger
while we're in the constable's company.

530
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:19,443
Quite so, madam. Witness.

531
00:51:26,287 --> 00:51:29,279
- Shall we continue on?
- What, you dare to leave it there?

532
00:51:29,447 --> 00:51:33,838
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greeley,
since all know i�s mine.

533
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:39,035
- Is that man drunk?
- Dead as Good friday, miss.

534
00:51:43,127 --> 00:51:45,402
- Good day to you, Mulraney.
- Boys.

535
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,205
- Jack.
- Slum sociable?

536
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:49,756
Fact-finding. Reforms-studying.

537
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:52,282
- May I present...?
- The Schermerhorns of fifth Avenue...

538
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,563
...scarcely require
an introduction from you.

539
00:51:54,727 --> 00:51:57,924
Schermerhorn, indeed. Their daughter.
This gentleman, of course...

540
00:51:58,087 --> 00:52:01,204
Horace Greeley, the famous publisher.
A pleasure and an honor.

541
00:52:01,607 --> 00:52:04,280
- Of the Tribune.
- I'm William Cutting.

542
00:52:05,607 --> 00:52:07,837
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?

543
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:13,280
As of this moment, extremely well,
thank you. How do you do?

544
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:15,723
Orange blossom. Delicious.

545
00:52:15,887 --> 00:52:18,082
- Mr. Cutting is...
- What a peach.

546
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:20,158
She could have a fine career
on the stage.

547
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:22,795
...one of Five Points' local...
- A pleasure to meet you.

548
00:52:22,967 --> 00:52:24,446
...leaders.
- Mr. Greeley.

549
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:26,563
- Pleased to meet you.
- The Points welcomes you.

550
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,560
You are welcome to these streets
and will pass in safety.

551
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:35,198
Oh, I'll see to their safety.
Thank you, Bill. There we are.

552
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:38,643
Good day, lads.
Criminal's braggadocio, you see.

553
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:42,880
- He knows who I am.
- You're well-known in these parts.

554
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:46,324
I must say that I find
that strangely flattering.

555
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:49,081
- I never did like crushers.
- Well, draw it mild, son.

556
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:53,604
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs
without I tell him he may do so.

557
00:53:05,647 --> 00:53:09,435
Do you think my watch
would be safe up on that lamppost, Bill?

558
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:13,036
Why don't you hang it up there and see?

559
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:16,882
Someday.

560
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:20,080
Someday is right.

561
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:23,758
This a new lad?

562
00:53:24,207 --> 00:53:29,486
Just another bastard son of Erin
I folded in the warmth of my embrace.

563
00:53:32,247 --> 00:53:34,761
- Hey!
- I just want to see your face, son.

564
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:36,997
No harm intended.

565
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,159
You get to know a lot butchering meat.

566
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,841
We're made up of the same things:
Flesh and blood...

567
00:54:06,007 --> 00:54:09,158
...tissue, organs.

568
00:54:09,327 --> 00:54:11,921
I love to work with pigs.

569
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:17,161
The nearest thing in nature to the flesh
of a man is the flesh of a pig.

570
00:54:17,327 --> 00:54:19,397
- Pig, huh?
- Tha�s right.

571
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:22,001
This is for you, mother.

572
00:54:24,407 --> 00:54:25,681
There you go.

573
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:28,759
- God bless you, Mr. Cutting.
- God bless you.

574
00:54:28,927 --> 00:54:33,205
- She ain't really my mother.
- I knew that, Bill.

575
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:39,357
This is the liver.

576
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:41,565
The kidneys.

577
00:54:41,727 --> 00:54:43,479
The heart.

578
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,878
This is a wound.
The stomach will bleed and bleed.

579
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:50,244
This is a kill. This is a kill.

580
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:54,323
The main artery. This is a kill.

581
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:57,524
You try.

582
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:01,846
Go ahead.

583
00:55:26,607 --> 00:55:28,996
The lung. Good.
Don't foul the blade on the rib.

584
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:31,237
Very good. Main artery.

585
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:34,080
Bleed him slow.
Let him think about it for a while.

586
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,966
Slow death. Good.

587
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:41,524
You'll each bill the city $5000
a month for supplies and services...

588
00:55:41,687 --> 00:55:43,405
...of which you'll receive 10%.

589
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:47,242
Bill! Mr. Killoran will work out
the details. Thank you, gentlemen.

590
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:50,319
Tha�s how we do things
around Tammany, gentlemen.

591
00:55:50,487 --> 00:55:52,318
Who's this then?

592
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:55,118
Thank you, boys.

593
00:55:55,287 --> 00:55:57,278
Good day, sir.

594
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,841
You got something on your mind?

595
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:15,478
Bill's taken quite a liking to you.

596
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:21,716
Now, if you're up to something, bene.

597
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:24,003
Only I don't want no part in it.

598
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:31,843
I was in Hellgate for 16 years.

599
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:34,482
I'm just trying to make my way is all.

600
00:56:34,647 --> 00:56:36,763
Just like you.

601
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:39,837
Unless, of course,
you got a better notion?

602
00:56:41,287 --> 00:56:42,356
No.

603
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:47,200
Bill, I can't get a day's work done
for all the good citizens...

604
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:50,723
...coming in here to harass me
about crime in the Points.

605
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:53,242
Some even go so far
as to accuse Tammany...

606
00:56:53,407 --> 00:56:57,002
...of connivance in this so-called
rampant criminality.

607
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,159
What am I to do? I can't have this.
Something has to be done.

608
00:57:00,327 --> 00:57:02,602
- What do you have in mind?
- I don't know.

609
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:04,962
I think maybe we should
hang someone.

610
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:08,203
- Who?
- No one important, necessarily.

611
00:57:08,367 --> 00:57:12,758
Average men will do.
Back-alley amusers with no affiliations.

612
00:57:12,927 --> 00:57:16,476
- How many?
- Three or four.

613
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:20,197
- Which?
- Four.

614
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:24,203
You stand here convicted varyingly...

615
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:27,359
...of lewdness, jack-rolling...

616
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:31,122
...sneak-thievery,
chloral-hydrating...

617
00:57:31,287 --> 00:57:33,881
...sodomy, strangulation...

618
00:57:34,047 --> 00:57:38,757
...and enthusiastic corruption
of the public good.

619
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:41,998
- We all go someday, huh?
- Chin up.

620
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,283
Handsome bunch of gallows fruit.
There's my old friend.

621
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,280
- How are you feeling, Arthur?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

622
00:57:47,447 --> 00:57:50,359
Say hello to Amsterdam. Nearly
fishhooked McGloin the other day.

623
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:51,642
- How do you do?
- Nearly.

624
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:53,445
See you dressed for the occasion.

625
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:55,677
You know me,
always like to look me best.

626
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,280
Tha�s the spirit.

627
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:01,525
Nice locket.
I'll give you a dollar for it.

628
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,279
L�s me mother's.

629
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:04,800
Dollar and a half?

630
00:58:05,727 --> 00:58:07,001
Done.

631
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:11,840
We'll miss you, Arthur.

632
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:14,077
- See you in the hot country, Seamus.
- Hot corn!

633
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:17,284
Ears of early white corn!
Hot corn!

634
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:23,198
Is my son present here?

635
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:26,400
Where's my little fella?

636
00:58:28,487 --> 00:58:30,205
Look at your dad.

637
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:32,318
Farewell, dear boy.

638
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:38,363
I never struck a foul blow,
nor turned a card.

639
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:43,203
May God greet me as a friend.

640
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:09,603
And grace my fears relieved

641
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:13,601
How precious
Did that grace appear

642
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:16,486
That night,
the reformers held a dance.

643
00:59:16,647 --> 00:59:19,036
That was the Five Points, all right.

644
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:22,358
Hangings of a morning,
dancings of an evening.

645
00:59:22,527 --> 00:59:24,358
- Sure meself, but...

646
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:27,246
...i�s not a matter of words.
I can tell by the way she smiles at me.

647
00:59:27,407 --> 00:59:29,284
- She smiles at a lot of people.
- Sir.

648
00:59:29,447 --> 00:59:30,675
You don't know her.

649
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:34,237
A penny of gratitude
for a fighting Irishman, young sir.

650
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:40,558
- You from Kerry?
- I am, sir. I am.

651
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:44,001
- It ain't much.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

652
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:46,635
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are delighted to see...

653
00:59:46,807 --> 00:59:50,117
...so many young faces
at our first annual Mission dance.

654
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:52,084
This'll be a real ballum rancum, eh?

655
00:59:52,247 --> 00:59:55,159
The Mission welcomes Christians
of every stamp...

656
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:58,763
...and we are particularly happy
to greet our Roman Catholic friends...

657
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:00,804
...who join us here tonight.

658
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:04,676
- Ladies! Come with me. Come with me.
- Shall we dance?

659
01:00:04,847 --> 01:00:07,566
We're going to start the dancing
in just a moment.

660
01:00:07,727 --> 01:00:08,716
No.

661
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:13,122
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Good evening, Your Holiness.

662
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:16,276
Good evening, Reverend.

663
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:19,405
Looks as though
you should have shaved closer.

664
01:00:23,047 --> 01:00:26,244
Good evening, Reverend.
I do beg your pardon.

665
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:32,159
Miss...?

666
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:38,964
- Everdeane.
- Miss Everdeane.

667
01:00:50,607 --> 01:00:55,362
Now, gentlemen, over here,
if you don't mind. Thank you.

668
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:58,246
Open it. Hold it up.

669
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:02,244
Into the mirror.

670
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:54,206
That one.

671
01:01:55,807 --> 01:01:59,004
Our queen has chosen.

672
01:02:16,807 --> 01:02:18,286
Sir...

673
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:20,802
...your lady.
- Right.

674
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:23,765
Regular services are held
at the church at 6 and 8.

675
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:24,962
Go to hell.

676
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:36,077
- What do you think you're doing?
- Dancing.

677
01:02:36,247 --> 01:02:39,364
- I said, why'd you pick me?
- Tha�s none of your business.

678
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:41,324
Would you mind telling me?

679
01:02:41,927 --> 01:02:43,360
I'm sorry.

680
01:02:44,287 --> 01:02:46,278
Goddamn it!

681
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:50,396
I'm sorry.
I'm not much of a dancer.

682
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,319
Just try to keep calm.

683
01:02:52,487 --> 01:02:56,560
- I never been to a stepping-ken before.
- L�s best not to look down.

684
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:01,167
You can hold me tighter if you like.

685
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,244
- All right?
- Aye.

686
01:03:12,007 --> 01:03:14,726
So why didn't you dance with Johnny?

687
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:17,566
Because...

688
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:22,117
...I didn't want him.

689
01:04:18,007 --> 01:04:20,202
I'm not wanting this.

690
01:04:27,127 --> 01:04:28,116
- Wait.
- What?

691
01:04:28,287 --> 01:04:29,766
Wait.

692
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:31,756
How does this open?

693
01:04:31,927 --> 01:04:35,761
It takes too long to lace back up.
We'll be here all night.

694
01:04:46,727 --> 01:04:49,525
Sure, all right, I'll take it off.

695
01:05:10,127 --> 01:05:12,846
There was a baby.
They cut it out.

696
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,799
I'm sorry.

697
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:21,803
Oh, i�s fine.

698
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:27,802
Have you got any scars?

699
01:05:29,247 --> 01:05:30,965
One or two.

700
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:28,644
Wha�s that, then?

701
01:06:28,807 --> 01:06:30,126
That?

702
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:32,636
L�s a gift from Mr. Cutting.

703
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:38,479
A gift?

704
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:40,924
A gift.

705
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,526
Was it your birthday?

706
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:46,399
No.

707
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,682
Wha�d you give him, then?

708
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:57,446
The answer to that
has nothing to do with you.

709
01:07:03,927 --> 01:07:06,361
- Don't tell me you're angry with me.
- No.

710
01:07:06,887 --> 01:07:08,957
I'm through with you.

711
01:07:12,807 --> 01:07:15,401
Well, you're quicker
than most fellows.

712
01:07:15,567 --> 01:07:17,762
Generally, they wait till afterwards.

713
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:20,805
I ain't interested
in the Butcher's leavings.

714
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:42,161
Hey! Bill says
keep clear of the pikers.

715
01:07:42,327 --> 01:07:45,125
- Fifteen to one, Bug-Eye Moran.
- Amsterdam!

716
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:48,157
Everyone was working
for the Butcher.

717
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:50,079
We ran his errands,
made his money...

718
01:07:50,247 --> 01:07:52,158
...took a piece and said,
"Thank you, sir."

719
01:07:52,327 --> 01:07:54,795
- Gentlemen, i�s a raid!
- Even Tweed.

720
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:57,276
- The figh�s over.
- Even me.

721
01:07:57,447 --> 01:08:00,007
- All right, you stupid...
- My father's son.

722
01:08:00,407 --> 01:08:02,523
- What the hell is this?
- Sorry, Bill.

723
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,362
The city ordinance against boxiana's
a blight, I grant you, but some...

724
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:09,405
I'm losing revenue while you speechify.
Collect those bets!

725
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:11,523
How do I collect
if no one won the fight?

726
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:14,406
This counts as a "no decision."
You got that covered, right?

727
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:16,398
Didn't anybody pay off the police?

728
01:08:16,567 --> 01:08:19,127
We paid the Municipal Police.
This is Metropolitan.

729
01:08:19,287 --> 01:08:21,243
- You'll repay me every cent.
- Mr. Tweed...

730
01:08:21,407 --> 01:08:23,523
- Who asked for your opinion?
- Let him speak!

731
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:24,961
He don't answer to you.

732
01:08:25,247 --> 01:08:27,681
The law says there's no boxing
in the city, right?

733
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:30,998
- Tha�s right. In the city.
- Well, where does the city end?

734
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,760
The winner, in the 75th round...

735
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:46,637
Allow me to acknowledge the man whose
vision and enterprise made possible...

736
01:08:46,807 --> 01:08:49,526
...the staging of this noble combat...

737
01:08:49,687 --> 01:08:53,521
...in these awe-inspiring
and entirely legal surroundings:

738
01:08:53,687 --> 01:08:56,565
Mr. William Cutting!

739
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:03,165
And... And his young associate!

740
01:09:03,527 --> 01:09:05,165
Tha�s you, boy.

741
01:09:07,047 --> 01:09:08,799
Come on, get in there.
Come on, son.

742
01:09:11,407 --> 01:09:13,841
You done very good.
How do you like them apples?

743
01:09:14,007 --> 01:09:15,759
We done good.
We done all right.

744
01:09:16,287 --> 01:09:18,847
- While I have your attention...
- It was a good show.

745
01:09:19,007 --> 01:09:21,282
...may I remind you of the wonders
that await you...

746
01:09:21,447 --> 01:09:25,235
...at my muzeum located on Broadway!

747
01:09:25,407 --> 01:09:28,638
P.T. Barnum's Gallery of Wonders!

748
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:34,726
- Tha�s my money!
- Get your hands out of me pockets!

749
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:41,120
L�s a funny feeling being took
under the wing of a dragon.

750
01:09:41,447 --> 01:09:43,756
L�s warmer than you think.

751
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:47,519
Tha�s the building of our country
right there, Mr. Cutting.

752
01:09:47,687 --> 01:09:49,484
Americans aborning.

753
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:53,162
I don't see no Americans.
I see trespassers.

754
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:56,797
Irish harps will do a job for a nickel
what a nigger does for a dime...

755
01:09:56,967 --> 01:09:58,844
...and a white man used to get
a quarter for.

756
01:09:59,007 --> 01:10:01,282
What have they done?
Name one thing they've contributed.

757
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,756
- Votes.
- Votes, you say?

758
01:10:03,927 --> 01:10:06,885
They vote how the archbishop
tells them. And who tells him?

759
01:10:07,047 --> 01:10:11,120
Their king in the pointy hat
what sits on his throne in Rome.

760
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:14,199
Bill's got mixed feelings
as regards the Irish.

761
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:19,206
Deliver these good and fervent folk
to the polls on a regular basis...

762
01:10:19,367 --> 01:10:23,679
...and there'll be a handsome price
for each vote goes Tammany's way.

763
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,835
My father gave his life
making this country what it is.

764
01:10:30,007 --> 01:10:35,035
Murdered by the British with all his men
on the 25th of July, anno Domini 1814.

765
01:10:35,207 --> 01:10:37,880
You think I'm gonna help you
befoul his legacy...

766
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:41,517
...by giving this country over to them
wha�s had no hand in fighting for it?

767
01:10:41,687 --> 01:10:45,521
Why? Because they come off a boat,
crawling with lice and begging for soup?

768
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:50,240
You're a great one for the fighting,
I know, but you can't fight forever.

769
01:10:50,407 --> 01:10:53,524
- I can go down doing it.
- And you will.

770
01:10:56,887 --> 01:10:58,798
What did you say?

771
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:02,004
I said, you're turning your back
on the future.

772
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:06,243
Not our future.

773
01:11:11,407 --> 01:11:15,195
That document makes you a citizen. This
makes you a private in the Union Army.

774
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:17,119
Now go fight for your country.

775
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:18,925
Next.

776
01:11:19,287 --> 01:11:22,085
Sign here, son.
Or make your mark.

777
01:11:22,247 --> 01:11:24,477
You're in the Army now.
Three square meals a day.

778
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,684
Uniforms first, then weapons.

779
01:11:28,407 --> 01:11:31,160
- I haven't eaten in two days.
- Keep moving, men.

780
01:11:39,527 --> 01:11:42,041
There's your musket.
Keep it dry on the boat.

781
01:11:42,207 --> 01:11:44,516
- Same for this cartridge case.
- Where are we going?

782
01:11:44,687 --> 01:11:46,359
- I heard Tennessee.
- Where's that?

783
01:11:59,367 --> 01:12:02,245
Do they feed us now, do you think?

784
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:15,598
My children! My children!

785
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:19,925
We must heal the divisions
between us.

786
01:12:20,087 --> 01:12:21,122
This war must cease.

787
01:12:24,047 --> 01:12:27,039
North and South must stand united!

788
01:12:31,407 --> 01:12:34,558
You're a liar! Rubbish!

789
01:12:35,607 --> 01:12:40,635
- What happens at the finish, then?
- Then we have ourselves a rowdy-dow.

790
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:44,403
- Ain't you been to the theater before?
- No.

791
01:12:44,567 --> 01:12:48,480
Mr. Legree, lay down your whip.

792
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:52,322
Miss Eliza,
join hands with Mr. Shelby.

793
01:12:52,487 --> 01:12:58,642
And, Topsy, dear little Topsy,
cradle Uncle Tom's head.

794
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:01,118
Leave the nigger dead!

795
01:13:10,727 --> 01:13:11,796
Get me down!

796
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:14,879
Down with the Union!

797
01:13:15,047 --> 01:13:16,639
Down with the Union!

798
01:13:16,807 --> 01:13:18,399
Down with the Union!

799
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:20,637
- Down with the Union!
- Down with the Union!

800
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:40,476
- For the blood of the Irish!
- Bill, get down!

801
01:13:49,287 --> 01:13:52,006
Somebody's popped the Butcher!

802
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:05,438
Stifle that rat bastard down!

803
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:14,087
God, forgive me.

804
01:14:31,047 --> 01:14:32,605
Whose man are you?

805
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:35,201
Speak smart and speak up.

806
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:37,566
Wha�s he saying, boy?

807
01:14:39,727 --> 01:14:41,683
I think he's making his peace
with God.

808
01:14:41,847 --> 01:14:43,963
The hell with that.
He makes peace with me.

809
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:47,597
I'm hearing confession tonight,
you mother-whoring Irish nigger!

810
01:14:47,767 --> 01:14:50,327
Whose man are you?
We speak English in this country.

811
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:52,159
Whose man are you?
See this knife?

812
01:14:52,327 --> 01:14:55,285
I'm gonna teach you to speak English
with this fucking knife!

813
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:56,926
Whose man are you?

814
01:14:57,087 --> 01:14:59,237
Whose man are you?

815
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:16,964
Well, that didn't tell us very much.

816
01:15:19,407 --> 01:15:21,477
Fine waistcoat.

817
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:25,437
Shame about it.
I don't think it can be mended.

818
01:15:25,847 --> 01:15:29,044
Will I keep it as a souvenir?

819
01:16:01,047 --> 01:16:03,766
Where's Legree? Where's Mopsy?

820
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:08,478
Tragedians, le�s continue.
Intermission is over!

821
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,806
Now that was bloody Shakespearean.

822
01:16:27,967 --> 01:16:31,357
- What?
- Do you know who Shakespeare was?

823
01:16:31,847 --> 01:16:34,315
He was the fellow who wrote
the King James Bible.

824
01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:36,637
I don't know what you're talking about.

825
01:16:36,807 --> 01:16:39,640
Tha�s because you're a thick,
ignorant, barbarous Irish whelp.

826
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,525
Just like your father.

827
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:46,875
Tha�s it.

828
01:16:47,047 --> 01:16:51,279
Tear my head off and destruct the world,
just like the rest of the stupid Irish.

829
01:16:51,447 --> 01:16:56,646
- Tha�s why I never ran with your dad.
- Get off me, you crazy bastard!

830
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:02,882
It means, if you're not strong,
you'd better be smart.

831
01:17:03,047 --> 01:17:05,720
I don't know if you're being
too clever or too dumb.

832
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,923
Whichever it is,
just remember this much.

833
01:17:08,087 --> 01:17:13,115
For all his faults, your father
was a man who loved his people.

834
01:17:19,047 --> 01:17:21,686
Amsterdam! Amsterdam!

835
01:17:21,847 --> 01:17:24,407
New York is calling you.

836
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:39,440
Look at that.
What in Chris�s name is that?

837
01:17:40,087 --> 01:17:45,320
Rhythms of the Dark Continent thrown
into the kettle with an Irish shindig.

838
01:17:45,487 --> 01:17:50,197
Stir it around a few times, pull it out,
i�s a fine American mess.

839
01:17:50,567 --> 01:17:52,956
A jig doing a jig.

840
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:55,844
A little keepsake.

841
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,282
- Good on you, sir.
- Come upstairs with me, Bill.

842
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:05,635
Have I ever had you before?

843
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:09,436
So you don't call me
by my Christian name.

844
01:18:10,847 --> 01:18:12,963
Bill! Thank God you're all right.

845
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:15,243
I heard the news
and came as quick as I could.

846
01:18:15,407 --> 01:18:17,477
You're as timely as the Angel of Death.

847
01:18:17,647 --> 01:18:22,084
Bill, you're not suggesting that I would
stoop to what you're suggesting?

848
01:18:22,247 --> 01:18:25,762
Stop slabbering. If I thought it was you,
you'd be in a wooden coat.

849
01:18:25,927 --> 01:18:29,124
The hole in my shoulder hurts,
so have a drink and shut up.

850
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,517
Or shut up and get out.

851
01:18:31,887 --> 01:18:33,366
I believe I'll have a drink.

852
01:18:33,527 --> 01:18:35,518
Careful, Tweedy,
the mor�s frenchified.

853
01:18:36,687 --> 01:18:39,997
No, no, I'm clean.
Come on, le�s go to the bar.

854
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,158
- Jenny.
- Bill.

855
01:19:17,447 --> 01:19:19,438
L�s gotta be tight.

856
01:19:19,607 --> 01:19:21,598
She loves to make me cry.

857
01:19:22,447 --> 01:19:23,846
You can take it.

858
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,563
There's my boy.

859
01:19:40,327 --> 01:19:41,840
L�s all right.

860
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:49,198
To the Butcher.

861
01:19:53,487 --> 01:19:55,637
We're all much obliged.

862
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,395
Forever.

863
01:19:58,567 --> 01:20:01,286
- Bill the Butcher.
- To the Butcher.

864
01:20:10,127 --> 01:20:12,083
Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?

865
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:16,322
Go on. Go.

866
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:36,125
Is there anyone in the Five Points
you haven't fucked?

867
01:20:36,287 --> 01:20:37,686
You!

868
01:20:47,727 --> 01:20:49,718
Calm down!

869
01:21:00,487 --> 01:21:02,523
Try it and I'll bite you!

870
01:21:02,687 --> 01:21:06,077
If you were gonna bite me,
I don't think you'd warn me, huh?

871
01:21:06,247 --> 01:21:07,965
Find out.

872
01:22:22,927 --> 01:22:24,485
I can't sleep.

873
01:22:30,447 --> 01:22:34,406
I hope you don't mind us
laying out tonight here, sir.

874
01:22:35,207 --> 01:22:38,005
Whatever takes your fancy,
my young friend.

875
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:50,399
Is it your shoulder
tha�s keeping you up?

876
01:22:50,567 --> 01:22:53,206
No, I don't never sleep too much.

877
01:22:53,567 --> 01:22:57,765
I have to sleep with one eye open.
I only got one eye, right?

878
01:23:02,247 --> 01:23:04,966
How old are you, Amsterdam?

879
01:23:09,527 --> 01:23:11,757
I'm not too sure.

880
01:23:11,927 --> 01:23:13,599
I never did figure it.

881
01:23:14,887 --> 01:23:17,003
I'm 47.

882
01:23:18,847 --> 01:23:21,122
Forty-seven years old.

883
01:23:24,727 --> 01:23:28,242
You know how I stayed alive this long?
All these years?

884
01:23:30,727 --> 01:23:32,638
Fear.

885
01:23:34,247 --> 01:23:37,125
The spectacle of fearsome acts.

886
01:23:38,087 --> 01:23:41,124
Somebody steals from me,
I cut off his hands.

887
01:23:41,287 --> 01:23:44,279
He offends me,
I cut out his tongue.

888
01:23:44,447 --> 01:23:49,726
He rises against me,
I cut off his head, stick it on a pike...

889
01:23:49,887 --> 01:23:53,766
...and raise it high up
so all in the streets can see.

890
01:23:54,807 --> 01:23:58,083
Tha�s what preserves
the order of things.

891
01:24:01,487 --> 01:24:03,125
Fear.

892
01:24:05,647 --> 01:24:07,365
That one tonight...

893
01:24:07,527 --> 01:24:09,563
...who was he?

894
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:12,998
A nobody.

895
01:24:13,927 --> 01:24:15,838
A coward.

896
01:24:17,407 --> 01:24:21,241
What an ignominious end
that would have been.

897
01:24:24,127 --> 01:24:29,247
I killed the last honorable man
15 years ago. Since then, i�s...

898
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:34,245
You've seen his portrait downstairs?

899
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:40,644
Is your mouth glued up with
cunny juice? I asked you a question!

900
01:24:40,807 --> 01:24:43,002
I said, I seen it, sir.

901
01:24:48,047 --> 01:24:51,039
Oh, you got a murderous rage
in you, and I like it.

902
01:24:51,207 --> 01:24:55,200
L�s life boiling up inside of you.
L�s good.

903
01:24:58,607 --> 01:25:02,885
The Priest and me,
we lived by the same principles.

904
01:25:05,127 --> 01:25:08,119
It was only faith divided us.

905
01:25:10,407 --> 01:25:12,125
He give me this, you know.

906
01:25:17,607 --> 01:25:20,804
That was the finest beating
I ever took.

907
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:22,886
My face was pulp...

908
01:25:23,047 --> 01:25:26,676
...my guts was pierced
and my ribs was all mashed up.

909
01:25:31,047 --> 01:25:33,720
And when he came to finish me...

910
01:25:37,527 --> 01:25:40,200
...I couldn't look him in the eye.

911
01:25:45,887 --> 01:25:50,563
He spared me because
he wanted me to live in shame.

912
01:25:50,727 --> 01:25:53,116
This was a great man.

913
01:25:55,687 --> 01:25:57,643
A great man.

914
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:03,519
So I cut out the eye that looked away.

915
01:26:06,247 --> 01:26:08,636
Sent it to him, wrapped in blue paper.

916
01:26:09,527 --> 01:26:13,122
I would have cut them both out
if I could have fought him blind.

917
01:26:15,047 --> 01:26:18,005
Then I rose back up again
with a full heart...

918
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:20,886
...and buried him in his own blood.

919
01:26:29,527 --> 01:26:31,438
Well done.

920
01:26:34,207 --> 01:26:37,677
He was the only man I ever killed
worth remembering.

921
01:26:48,807 --> 01:26:51,241
I never had a son.

922
01:26:59,087 --> 01:27:01,885
Civilization is crumbling.

923
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,597
God bless you.

924
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:53,806
If you got anything to say...

925
01:27:54,367 --> 01:27:57,006
...now is the time to say it.

926
01:27:57,167 --> 01:27:59,283
Who is he to you, Jenny?

927
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:07,715
I was 12 years old.

928
01:28:07,887 --> 01:28:11,482
My mother was dead.
I was living in a doorway.

929
01:28:13,727 --> 01:28:18,039
He took me in, took care of me...

930
01:28:18,847 --> 01:28:20,838
...in his own way.

931
01:28:25,687 --> 01:28:28,247
After they cut out the baby...

932
01:28:30,687 --> 01:28:34,202
Well, he doesn't fancy girls
that scarred up.

933
01:28:40,767 --> 01:28:45,079
You should know in your own mind...

934
01:28:46,247 --> 01:28:50,160
...that he never laid a hand on me
until I asked him to.

935
01:29:11,687 --> 01:29:13,882
Who are you?

936
01:29:14,727 --> 01:29:17,116
Who are you?

937
01:30:30,687 --> 01:30:34,123
Gentlemen. Fine gentlemen,
you are most welcome...

938
01:30:34,287 --> 01:30:37,882
...to this palace of wonder
and enchantment...

939
01:30:38,047 --> 01:30:42,837
...where visions to rival the finest
imaginings of Scheherezade...

940
01:30:43,007 --> 01:30:45,885
...and her tales from
the perfumed nights of Arabia...

941
01:30:46,047 --> 01:30:49,881
...will greet your famished eyes.

942
01:31:07,767 --> 01:31:11,123
What am I bid for this
flaxen-haired Teutonic beauty?

943
01:31:11,607 --> 01:31:16,727
Feast your eyes on the magnificent
plumage of these exotic creatures.

944
01:31:16,887 --> 01:31:19,720
Gentlemen, you've seen
our caged birds.

945
01:31:19,887 --> 01:31:23,926
Well, how'd you like
to make them sing?

946
01:31:24,087 --> 01:31:30,003
Let me see the color of your money,
and they could be singing for you.

947
01:31:35,767 --> 01:31:39,123
May God put the steel of the Holy Spirit
in my spine...

948
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:43,757
...and the love of the Blessed Virgin
in my heart.

949
01:31:46,607 --> 01:31:48,518
Amen.

950
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:54,118
Easy now.

951
01:31:54,287 --> 01:31:56,039
What did you say?

952
01:31:56,207 --> 01:31:58,596
He's not who he says he is.

953
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:01,165
He's not who he says he is?

954
01:32:01,327 --> 01:32:05,206
What am I bid? What am I bid?
What am I bid?

955
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:08,843
Count your blessings
he considers you a friend.

956
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:14,916
The only thing he considers, every day
and every night, is how best to kill you.

957
01:32:16,207 --> 01:32:19,882
You got a loose tongue in your head.
You want me to take it out for you?

958
01:32:20,047 --> 01:32:23,164
I'll bury it right up your fundament
where it belongs.

959
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:25,477
I can read right through you.
You're empty...

960
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:27,956
His name is Vallon!

961
01:32:29,487 --> 01:32:33,321
Don't do it, Bill. His name's Vallon.

962
01:33:03,567 --> 01:33:06,161
They're curious people,
these Celestials.

963
01:33:06,327 --> 01:33:07,555
Don't trust this guy.

964
01:33:07,727 --> 01:33:09,638
- Know why he wears short sleeves?
- Why?

965
01:33:09,807 --> 01:33:12,037
So everyone can see
he's got nothing stashed.

966
01:33:12,287 --> 01:33:15,279
Jesus, le�s hope that never
becomes the fashion.

967
01:33:21,367 --> 01:33:23,119
Johnny.

968
01:33:58,887 --> 01:34:00,605
Get up.

969
01:34:14,727 --> 01:34:19,755
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I may have your kind attention.

970
01:34:19,927 --> 01:34:22,316
As some of you have surely noticed...

971
01:34:22,487 --> 01:34:26,321
...our friend and benefactor
Mr. William Cutting...

972
01:34:26,487 --> 01:34:32,596
...is tonight wearing a waistcoat
of certain distinction.

973
01:34:33,687 --> 01:34:35,245
Might we...

974
01:34:36,847 --> 01:34:40,237
Might we tonight appeal
to him to favor us...

975
01:34:40,407 --> 01:34:44,480
...with another exciting exhibition
of skill...

976
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:49,767
...courage, daring and drama!

977
01:35:01,527 --> 01:35:05,998
- The Sword of Damascus!
- The Tomahawk!

978
01:35:07,607 --> 01:35:09,199
Bill's going up.

979
01:35:15,927 --> 01:35:17,758
Show us your knives.

980
01:35:17,927 --> 01:35:20,361
Strut your stuff, Billy boy.

981
01:35:20,527 --> 01:35:22,802
Sword of Damascus!

982
01:35:36,087 --> 01:35:39,124
- The Spider's Kiss!
- The River of Blood!

983
01:35:39,287 --> 01:35:42,757
- The Morning Glory!
- The Wheel of Death!

984
01:35:42,927 --> 01:35:45,043
- William Tell!
- The Butterfly!

985
01:35:45,367 --> 01:35:47,085
- The Tomahawk!
- The Spider's Kiss!

986
01:35:47,447 --> 01:35:49,199
The Butcher's Apprentice!

987
01:35:49,367 --> 01:35:50,686
The Butcher's Apprentice.

988
01:35:50,847 --> 01:35:53,998
- Command performance.
- Command performance.

989
01:35:54,247 --> 01:35:56,397
- Command performance.
- Where have you been?

990
01:35:56,567 --> 01:35:58,956
A command performance indeed!

991
01:35:59,127 --> 01:36:00,719
- Get out of here.
- Don't do it.

992
01:36:00,887 --> 01:36:05,324
And for this I must beg the indulgence
of my former assistant...

993
01:36:05,487 --> 01:36:07,842
...in matters of impalement.

994
01:36:08,007 --> 01:36:11,283
The Butcher's original apprentice.

995
01:36:12,087 --> 01:36:17,002
What do you say, Jen?
One more time for the sweet souvenir?

996
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:18,964
Come on.

997
01:36:27,927 --> 01:36:29,963
Don't you do it.

998
01:36:30,607 --> 01:36:32,723
Good girl, Jenny.

999
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:36,562
- Don't be afraid.
- What a woman.

1000
01:36:39,087 --> 01:36:40,839
Good evening, Bill.

1001
01:36:41,007 --> 01:36:42,963
She'll be all right.

1002
01:36:45,647 --> 01:36:48,684
- Remember this?
- Of course.

1003
01:36:57,047 --> 01:37:01,996
You may feel more comfortable
without that garment, Miss Everdeane.

1004
01:37:03,127 --> 01:37:06,164
You'll have to filch me a new one, Bill.

1005
01:37:18,927 --> 01:37:21,316
Anything in your pockets tonight?

1006
01:37:21,487 --> 01:37:23,717
Oh, I ain't started working yet.

1007
01:37:26,767 --> 01:37:29,520
What about that locket
that I gave you?

1008
01:37:44,207 --> 01:37:47,438
Apologies, my dear. Pick it up.

1009
01:37:52,087 --> 01:37:53,964
Whoopsie-daisy!

1010
01:37:55,887 --> 01:37:58,276
Now i�s good and broke.

1011
01:37:59,247 --> 01:38:01,636
I can't seem to get anything
right tonight.

1012
01:38:09,007 --> 01:38:12,682
You got the sand to give them
a grand finale?

1013
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:23,644
Maybe when you're aiming
a little straighter.

1014
01:38:31,007 --> 01:38:35,398
Still got some blood in you, Jen?
Enough of this heathen music!

1015
01:38:35,567 --> 01:38:38,604
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.
Strike up, boys!

1016
01:38:38,767 --> 01:38:43,966
Ready? This is a night for Americans!

1017
01:38:50,687 --> 01:38:53,076
- Jenny!
- Get your hands off me.

1018
01:38:53,247 --> 01:38:56,205
- Go away.
- Get your hands off me!

1019
01:38:59,127 --> 01:39:00,355
Move.

1020
01:39:00,527 --> 01:39:02,518
Amsterdam!

1021
01:39:45,847 --> 01:39:47,963
Hats off!

1022
01:39:54,207 --> 01:39:58,723
We hold in our hearts the memory
of our fallen brothers...

1023
01:39:58,967 --> 01:40:02,323
...whose blood stains the very streets
we walk today.

1024
01:40:03,847 --> 01:40:09,365
Also on this night, we pay tribute
to the leader of our enemies...

1025
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:15,757
...an honorable man
who crossed over bravely...

1026
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:18,487
...fighting for what he believed in.

1027
01:40:24,407 --> 01:40:28,878
To defeat my enemy,
I extinguish his life...

1028
01:40:29,047 --> 01:40:32,881
...and consume him
as I consume these flames.

1029
01:40:34,247 --> 01:40:36,397
In honor of Priest Vallon.

1030
01:40:44,567 --> 01:40:46,046
Tha�s a wound.

1031
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:48,637
God!

1032
01:40:54,927 --> 01:40:59,842
I want you all to meet
the son of Priest Vallon.

1033
01:41:00,007 --> 01:41:02,567
I took him under my wing...

1034
01:41:02,727 --> 01:41:04,399
...and see how I'm repaid?

1035
01:41:04,567 --> 01:41:06,637
- You bastard!
- Saves my life one day...

1036
01:41:06,807 --> 01:41:09,275
...so he can kill me the next
like a sneak-thief...

1037
01:41:09,447 --> 01:41:12,325
...instead of fighting like a man.

1038
01:41:12,727 --> 01:41:16,845
A base defiler,
unworthy of a noble name.

1039
01:41:19,127 --> 01:41:21,482
God! Jesus!

1040
01:41:29,527 --> 01:41:32,485
All right, tha�ll do, McGloin.
Splay him out.

1041
01:41:33,567 --> 01:41:38,163
This show ain't for blackies.
You! You get to watch.

1042
01:41:39,607 --> 01:41:42,167
Don't you hear, nigger?

1043
01:41:43,527 --> 01:41:47,122
This is fresh meat.
You know what I mean?

1044
01:41:47,287 --> 01:41:50,484
We need to tenderize this meat
a little bit.

1045
01:41:50,647 --> 01:41:54,322
All right, le�s kiss good night
to that pretty young face of yours.

1046
01:41:58,767 --> 01:41:59,916
No!

1047
01:42:04,287 --> 01:42:06,164
No!

1048
01:42:07,247 --> 01:42:10,956
Wha�ll it be, then? Rib or chop?
Loin or shank?

1049
01:42:11,127 --> 01:42:13,038
- The liver!
- The spleen!

1050
01:42:13,207 --> 01:42:14,845
- The tongue!
- Kidneys!

1051
01:42:20,887 --> 01:42:22,957
- The lungs!
- The liver!

1052
01:42:23,127 --> 01:42:24,879
- The tongue!
- The kidneys!

1053
01:42:25,047 --> 01:42:27,277
- The stomach!
- The heart! The heart!

1054
01:42:27,447 --> 01:42:29,836
The heart? This boy has no heart.

1055
01:42:30,007 --> 01:42:32,680
- Then kill him!
- Kill him!

1056
01:42:37,687 --> 01:42:42,158
He ain't earned a death.
He ain't earned a death at my hands.

1057
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:46,759
No. He'll walk amongst you
marked with shame...

1058
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:52,081
...a freak worthy of Barnum's
Muzeum of Wonders.

1059
01:42:52,247 --> 01:42:55,557
Go�s only man spared
by the Butcher.

1060
01:42:55,727 --> 01:42:57,080
No, Bill!

1061
01:42:58,207 --> 01:43:01,085
No! No!

1062
01:43:01,407 --> 01:43:04,763
No! No! No!

1063
01:43:04,927 --> 01:43:08,237
No! No! No!

1064
01:43:33,567 --> 01:43:35,637
Here. Here!

1065
01:43:35,807 --> 01:43:38,162
This way. Come on. Come on!

1066
01:44:22,327 --> 01:44:24,522
I wanna show you something.

1067
01:44:29,207 --> 01:44:32,244
My mother's bones share this grave.

1068
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:38,638
I've saved 10 cents out of every dollar
I've ever earned since I was 13.

1069
01:44:38,807 --> 01:44:40,843
Tha�s $ 215.

1070
01:44:41,007 --> 01:44:46,559
Tha�s $215 for bludgeting
and the rest.

1071
01:44:49,847 --> 01:44:53,522
This is what I wanted to show you.

1072
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:56,247
This is where we're gonna go
as soon as you get well.

1073
01:44:56,967 --> 01:45:01,245
San francisco, California.

1074
01:45:03,847 --> 01:45:06,407
You can have anything you want
out there.

1075
01:45:06,567 --> 01:45:12,199
These men are pulling gold right out
of the river with their own hands.

1076
01:45:13,927 --> 01:45:18,079
We're here, and we need to get there.

1077
01:45:18,807 --> 01:45:24,086
We start here, go down around here...

1078
01:45:26,087 --> 01:45:28,601
...to San francisco.

1079
01:45:30,087 --> 01:45:32,043
Shortest way to go.

1080
01:45:32,807 --> 01:45:35,196
Would you go with me?

1081
01:45:58,807 --> 01:46:02,402
No need to fire that, miss.
Or even aim it.

1082
01:46:02,887 --> 01:46:06,163
An audience with your mangled friend
is all I want.

1083
01:46:20,967 --> 01:46:22,958
I got 44 notches in my club.

1084
01:46:25,207 --> 01:46:27,038
Do you know what they're for?

1085
01:46:29,127 --> 01:46:31,925
To remind me of what I owe God
when I die.

1086
01:46:38,647 --> 01:46:41,366
My father was killed in battle too.

1087
01:46:42,007 --> 01:46:44,885
In Ireland, in the streets...

1088
01:46:46,487 --> 01:46:49,126
...fighting those who would take
as their privilege...

1089
01:46:49,287 --> 01:46:53,360
...what could only be got and held
by the decimation of a race.

1090
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:57,204
That war is 1000 years old or more.

1091
01:46:57,847 --> 01:47:00,645
We never expected it to follow us here.

1092
01:47:02,487 --> 01:47:04,478
It didn't.

1093
01:47:04,647 --> 01:47:07,207
It was waiting for us when we landed.

1094
01:47:10,727 --> 01:47:14,959
Your father tried to carve out a corner
in this country for his tribe.

1095
01:47:16,687 --> 01:47:19,440
That was him.
That was his Dead Rabbits.

1096
01:47:22,247 --> 01:47:25,683
I often wondered,
if he'd lived a bit longer...

1097
01:47:26,487 --> 01:47:29,047
...would he have wanted a bit more?

1098
01:47:39,927 --> 01:47:43,078
Why'd you rifle through
his pockets then?

1099
01:47:59,447 --> 01:48:01,802
For safekeeping.

1100
01:48:04,567 --> 01:48:06,922
I thought maybe you could do with it.

1101
01:48:27,607 --> 01:48:30,599
The blood stays on the blade.

1102
01:49:44,087 --> 01:49:46,157
Tha�s a sorry-looking pelt.

1103
01:49:50,527 --> 01:49:54,361
And i�s been so nice and quiet
for the last three months.

1104
01:49:56,447 --> 01:49:59,917
Tell me, this charge,
does it sit uneasy with you?

1105
01:50:01,047 --> 01:50:03,117
No, i�s...

1106
01:50:03,967 --> 01:50:06,356
...not uneasy, Bill.

1107
01:50:07,127 --> 01:50:09,561
No, I wouldn't say that.

1108
01:50:11,447 --> 01:50:16,396
But my allegiance is to the law.

1109
01:50:17,407 --> 01:50:19,967
I'm paid to uphold the law.

1110
01:50:35,207 --> 01:50:38,563
What in heaven's name
are you talking about?

1111
01:50:42,487 --> 01:50:45,126
You may have misgivings,
but don't go believing that.

1112
01:50:45,287 --> 01:50:47,847
That way lies damnation.

1113
01:50:50,887 --> 01:50:53,845
I'm in no danger of damnation, Bill.

1114
01:51:04,567 --> 01:51:06,717
Here's the thing.

1115
01:51:07,767 --> 01:51:10,600
I don't give a tuppenny fuck
about your moral conundrum...

1116
01:51:10,767 --> 01:51:13,600
...you meatheaded shit-sack.

1117
01:51:14,887 --> 01:51:17,526
Tha�s more or less the thing.

1118
01:51:18,807 --> 01:51:21,844
And I want you to go out there...
You, nobody else.

1119
01:51:22,007 --> 01:51:26,239
None of your little minions.
I want you to go out there...

1120
01:51:26,407 --> 01:51:28,477
...and I want you...

1121
01:51:29,367 --> 01:51:33,121
...to punish the person...

1122
01:51:33,287 --> 01:51:35,676
...who's responsible...

1123
01:51:37,687 --> 01:51:42,238
...for murdering
this poor little rabbit.

1124
01:51:48,007 --> 01:51:50,077
Is that understood?

1125
01:51:53,767 --> 01:51:55,439
Right.

1126
01:51:56,647 --> 01:52:00,083
Help yourself to some decent meat
on the way out.

1127
01:52:35,727 --> 01:52:37,479
Damn it.

1128
01:52:39,087 --> 01:52:41,043
Is that you, boy?

1129
01:52:42,007 --> 01:52:44,441
I didn't mean nothing
by that shot, you know.

1130
01:52:45,847 --> 01:52:48,520
You scared me is all.

1131
01:52:50,607 --> 01:52:53,360
Sure you know I'd never do you harm.

1132
01:52:54,167 --> 01:52:56,522
Come out now, lad.

1133
01:52:58,647 --> 01:53:01,320
Remember your father and me.

1134
01:53:04,247 --> 01:53:07,876
Are you too young to remember
your old Uncle Jack?

1135
01:53:09,647 --> 01:53:12,207
Oh, the times we had.

1136
01:53:17,527 --> 01:53:19,882
You know I won't hurt you.

1137
01:53:40,607 --> 01:53:42,598
Is he dead?

1138
01:53:42,767 --> 01:53:46,043
I'm gonna get Andrew.
Andrew, come see.

1139
01:53:46,207 --> 01:53:50,280
Andrew, come see, quick!
Everybody, quick!

1140
01:53:50,447 --> 01:53:54,918
This is bad for everybody.
Wha�s next? Dead politicians?

1141
01:53:55,807 --> 01:54:00,756
I could spare half a dozen of you
easier than I can spare him.

1142
01:54:01,487 --> 01:54:05,082
Still, I think it shows dash.

1143
01:54:05,247 --> 01:54:09,081
Give the boy some time.
We'll settle with a good dustup.

1144
01:54:50,687 --> 01:54:54,043
There's more of us coming
off these ships every day.

1145
01:54:54,687 --> 01:54:58,202
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.

1146
01:54:59,167 --> 01:55:01,522
And we're afraid of the Natives.

1147
01:55:03,447 --> 01:55:07,759
Get all of us together,
we ain't got a gang. We got an army.

1148
01:55:07,927 --> 01:55:10,487
And all you nee�s a spark, right?
Just one spark.

1149
01:55:10,647 --> 01:55:13,081
Something to wake us all up.

1150
01:55:28,967 --> 01:55:31,527
It was me played you false.

1151
01:55:33,287 --> 01:55:36,723
- I'd take it back if I could.
- Take it back?

1152
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:42,635
Johnny, I gotta kill you.

1153
01:55:55,847 --> 01:55:58,964
Get out of the Points
and don't come back.

1154
01:56:06,167 --> 01:56:08,476
Where you going, boyo?

1155
01:56:09,447 --> 01:56:10,880
Come along.

1156
01:56:11,047 --> 01:56:12,799
Come on.

1157
01:56:15,127 --> 01:56:17,925
Tell us, John, wha�s the trouble?

1158
01:56:18,727 --> 01:56:20,445
No trouble, Bill.

1159
01:56:23,367 --> 01:56:25,881
Still hiding out with your friends?

1160
01:56:28,887 --> 01:56:33,358
No, I'm... I'm not with them, Bill.

1161
01:56:33,527 --> 01:56:36,519
I'm with you. I'm with the Natives.

1162
01:56:40,887 --> 01:56:44,960
You always was a Native
as far as I'm interested, John...

1163
01:56:47,207 --> 01:56:50,005
...till you became a stag.

1164
01:56:53,287 --> 01:56:56,802
You tell me you're a Native.
Do you want to know what a Native is?

1165
01:56:58,567 --> 01:57:01,923
A Native is a man...

1166
01:57:02,087 --> 01:57:06,603
...wha�s willing to give his life
for his country...

1167
01:57:08,407 --> 01:57:10,637
...like my father done.

1168
01:57:13,607 --> 01:57:17,441
Are you willing to do that,
my young friend?

1169
01:57:26,007 --> 01:57:29,124
John. Johnny!

1170
01:57:36,327 --> 01:57:38,238
Johnny?

1171
01:57:47,287 --> 01:57:49,198
John...

1172
01:58:00,967 --> 01:58:03,686
It hurts too much.

1173
01:58:09,487 --> 01:58:11,557
Just kill me.

1174
01:58:15,927 --> 01:58:18,282
Just kill me.

1175
01:58:19,767 --> 01:58:22,918
Please, please.

1176
01:58:30,127 --> 01:58:32,083
Please.

1177
01:58:34,247 --> 01:58:36,078
Please.

1178
01:58:40,047 --> 01:58:42,436
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1179
01:58:57,207 --> 01:58:59,562
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

1180
01:58:59,727 --> 01:59:03,083
...now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

1181
01:59:03,767 --> 01:59:05,997
Rest in peace, Ma.

1182
01:59:08,607 --> 01:59:10,916
Wha�re you doing here, boyo?

1183
01:59:16,927 --> 01:59:20,124
Wha�s a nigger doing in this church?

1184
01:59:24,207 --> 01:59:26,357
Wha�s a Dead Rabbit doing
with the Natives?

1185
01:59:26,527 --> 01:59:29,564
There's no niggers in the Natives.
Natives and Rabbits is one thing.

1186
01:59:29,727 --> 01:59:31,638
A nigger in the church
is something else!

1187
01:59:31,807 --> 01:59:33,638
You run with the Natives,
pray with them!

1188
01:59:33,807 --> 01:59:36,799
You're gonna wind up on a stake
like your man did!

1189
01:59:37,527 --> 01:59:38,755
McGloin.

1190
01:59:38,927 --> 01:59:43,159
Father! Jesus, did you know
there's a nigger in your church?

1191
02:00:00,447 --> 02:00:02,836
Jesus.

1192
02:00:24,407 --> 02:00:26,841
The earth turns...

1193
02:00:27,607 --> 02:00:30,201
...but we don 't feel it move.

1194
02:00:32,727 --> 02:00:35,446
Then one night you look up.

1195
02:00:36,407 --> 02:00:41,356
One spark, and the sky is on fire.

1196
02:00:52,127 --> 02:00:54,960
L�s a touching spectacle.

1197
02:00:56,607 --> 02:00:59,599
We'll come back
when you're ready for us.

1198
02:01:05,607 --> 02:01:09,282
The past is the torch
that lights our way.

1199
02:01:09,527 --> 02:01:14,726
Where our fathers have shown us
the path, we shall follow.

1200
02:01:16,487 --> 02:01:20,639
Our faith is the weapon most feared
by our enemies.

1201
02:01:20,887 --> 02:01:25,597
For thereby shall we lift our people up
against those who would destroy us.

1202
02:01:25,767 --> 02:01:30,477
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits
to remind all of our suffering...

1203
02:01:30,647 --> 02:01:34,356
...and as a call to those who suffer still
to join our ranks...

1204
02:01:34,527 --> 02:01:39,123
...however so far they may have strayed
from our common home across the sea.

1205
02:01:39,287 --> 02:01:42,802
For with great numbers
must come great strength...

1206
02:01:44,487 --> 02:01:46,557
...and the salvation of our people.

1207
02:01:47,047 --> 02:01:49,322
- We don't want your business.
- How many men live here?

1208
02:01:49,487 --> 02:01:51,921
- You have to register.
- You can't force me to join.

1209
02:01:52,087 --> 02:01:53,679
- Have you got $300?
- Of course not.

1210
02:01:53,847 --> 02:01:57,157
- Who's got $300?
- Lf you're drafted, release from service...

1211
02:01:57,327 --> 02:02:00,603
...can only be secured for $300,
according to the Conscription Act.

1212
02:02:00,767 --> 02:02:03,281
- Otherwise, you have to serve!
- Who the hell's got $300?

1213
02:02:03,447 --> 02:02:06,962
You have to serve, sir,
unless you have $300!

1214
02:02:07,127 --> 02:02:09,004
- Boys!
- Go back to where you came from!

1215
02:02:09,167 --> 02:02:13,365
I'm born in this country. You immigrated
here. You will fight for this country!

1216
02:02:13,527 --> 02:02:16,087
Sweet Jesus!
War does terrible things to men.

1217
02:02:16,247 --> 02:02:22,004
- Get back uptown where you belong!
- $300? So i�s another rich man's war.

1218
02:02:22,167 --> 02:02:25,159
Sir, I request an audience
with this man.

1219
02:02:27,127 --> 02:02:29,197
No one speak English
in New York anymore?

1220
02:02:29,367 --> 02:02:31,403
- Don't understand.
- You do speak English.

1221
02:02:33,247 --> 02:02:37,479
I wonder if Miss Everdeane could
angle her rifle in some other direction.

1222
02:02:42,607 --> 02:02:47,158
I wonder, Mr. Vallon, if you understand
the true value of this sort of publicity.

1223
02:02:50,927 --> 02:02:54,715
The archbishop himself, shoulder to
shoulder with the Irish in the Five Points.

1224
02:02:55,247 --> 02:02:58,284
I'm offering to form an alliance
with you against Bill Cutting...

1225
02:02:58,447 --> 02:03:01,041
...and his slate
of Nativist candidates.

1226
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:05,041
I'll negotiate a handsome fee for every
Irish vote you send Tammany's way...

1227
02:03:05,207 --> 02:03:07,437
...in the coming elections.

1228
02:03:08,847 --> 02:03:11,884
I need a new friend
in the Five Points, son.

1229
02:03:14,807 --> 02:03:17,162
I'd like that friend to be you.

1230
02:03:20,247 --> 02:03:22,841
Now, just a moment, Mr. Tweed.

1231
02:03:23,007 --> 02:03:26,079
Suppose we do
get you those votes.

1232
02:03:28,327 --> 02:03:30,477
Would you back an Irish candidate
of my choosing?

1233
02:03:30,647 --> 02:03:33,525
- I don't think so.
- What if we get you all the Irish votes?

1234
02:03:33,807 --> 02:03:37,356
That will only happen
in the reign of Queen Dick.

1235
02:03:39,287 --> 02:03:41,403
- Beg your pardon?
- It will never happen.

1236
02:03:41,567 --> 02:03:44,877
I might be persuaded to back an
Irish candidate for, say, alderman.

1237
02:03:45,047 --> 02:03:47,720
- Alderman?
- We've already got Irish aldermen.

1238
02:03:47,887 --> 02:03:51,118
- So we have. Tha�s why...
- Well, wha�s bigger than alderman?

1239
02:03:52,527 --> 02:03:56,156
Sheriff. Sheriff.
All right, Mr. Tweed.

1240
02:03:56,327 --> 02:04:00,115
You back an Irishman for sheriff
of the city and county of New York...

1241
02:04:00,287 --> 02:04:01,606
...and we'll get him elected.

1242
02:04:01,767 --> 02:04:04,998
I love the Irish, but higher than alderman
you shall never climb.

1243
02:04:05,167 --> 02:04:07,556
- Well, why not?
- For one thing, no man living...

1244
02:04:07,727 --> 02:04:09,445
...can consolidate the Irish vote.
- I can.

1245
02:04:09,607 --> 02:04:11,723
And for another,
I mean no effrontery...

1246
02:04:11,887 --> 02:04:15,960
...no one's yet found an Irish candidate
for sheriff worth voting for.

1247
02:04:18,247 --> 02:04:19,566
Monk.

1248
02:04:20,567 --> 02:04:21,841
Here.

1249
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:28,727
He's to have me looking as sober
as me own grandfather.

1250
02:04:28,887 --> 02:04:32,880
- Another great man, I'm sure.
- A thorough drunken bastard.

1251
02:04:34,807 --> 02:04:36,525
Could I say what I want?

1252
02:04:37,647 --> 02:04:39,877
Well, tha�s why I wanted you.

1253
02:04:40,047 --> 02:04:42,845
Our elected representatives
are a gang of thieves...

1254
02:04:43,007 --> 02:04:44,679
...who swear to better our lot...

1255
02:04:44,847 --> 02:04:47,600
...while dipping their hands deep
into our pockets.

1256
02:04:47,767 --> 02:04:51,316
I stand shoulder to shoulder with
community leaders like Bill Cutting...

1257
02:04:51,727 --> 02:04:55,436
...against any and all inroads
into our fine democracy.

1258
02:04:55,607 --> 02:04:59,646
I'll see to it that no one takes away what
you've earned by pluck and application.

1259
02:04:59,807 --> 02:05:01,798
- To invading hordes of Hibernians!

1260
02:05:01,967 --> 02:05:05,846
You go to the polls and you put your
mark next to the name Walter McGinn.

1261
02:05:06,007 --> 02:05:10,478
- Against the potato eaters, like them
over there, thieving our jobs!

1262
02:05:10,647 --> 02:05:12,922
Why should so many
Irish die down south...

1263
02:05:13,087 --> 02:05:17,524
...when the first war to win is not down
in Dixie, but right here in these streets?

1264
02:05:19,287 --> 02:05:21,960
And who's the finest street fighter
in the Five Points?

1265
02:05:22,167 --> 02:05:24,237
- Monk!
- Tha�s right.

1266
02:05:24,407 --> 02:05:27,046
Now, let the whole damn city hear it!

1267
02:05:28,407 --> 02:05:30,159
That man was right born for this.

1268
02:05:30,327 --> 02:05:33,239
Well, he's killed 44 men,
laid low a couple hundred more.

1269
02:05:33,407 --> 02:05:34,999
- Is that right?
- Tha�s right.

1270
02:05:35,167 --> 02:05:37,158
I should have run him for mayor.

1271
02:05:39,287 --> 02:05:42,438
All right, line them up.
L�s election day!

1272
02:05:42,927 --> 02:05:46,124
Not so fast,
you little yellow bastard!

1273
02:05:46,327 --> 02:05:48,079
Come on!

1274
02:05:51,647 --> 02:05:53,558
Come on, you bastard,
we need your vote.

1275
02:05:53,727 --> 02:05:57,003
Bastard? I fought for you, nigger.
I lost an arm for you.

1276
02:05:57,167 --> 02:05:58,919
Well, tha�s a start.
Now, come on.

1277
02:05:59,087 --> 02:06:00,759
Rise and shine.
Rise and shine.

1278
02:06:00,927 --> 02:06:03,964
In this great country of ours,
even the hop fiends get to vote!

1279
02:06:05,207 --> 02:06:06,959
Less art and more haste, Don.

1280
02:06:07,127 --> 02:06:09,516
- Where are you going?
- I already voted today.

1281
02:06:09,687 --> 02:06:12,565
Cast for Monk and Tammany,
by God. Twice.

1282
02:06:12,727 --> 02:06:16,402
Twice? Only twice? You call that doing
your civic duty? Come with me.

1283
02:06:16,567 --> 02:06:19,081
Oh, no, you don't.
Get back and sit down.

1284
02:06:19,247 --> 02:06:21,238
Here's another one.
Clean him up good.

1285
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:23,967
Shave their beards and send them back
to vote again.

1286
02:06:24,127 --> 02:06:26,880
All right, boys. Vote Monk, Tammany.
Monk, Tammany!

1287
02:06:27,047 --> 02:06:30,005
So, gentlemen, what our great city
needs is a new courthouse.

1288
02:06:30,167 --> 02:06:32,920
I propose it should be a modest,
economical structure.

1289
02:06:33,087 --> 02:06:34,805
Excuse me one moment.

1290
02:06:34,967 --> 02:06:38,357
Monk's already won by 3000
more votes than there are voters.

1291
02:06:38,527 --> 02:06:41,917
Three? Make it 20, 30. We don't need
a victory. We need a Roman triumph!

1292
02:06:42,087 --> 02:06:46,160
- But we don't have any more ballots.
- Remember the first rule of politics:

1293
02:06:46,327 --> 02:06:49,558
The ballots don't make the results,
the counters make the results.

1294
02:06:49,727 --> 02:06:50,796
Keep counting.

1295
02:07:21,367 --> 02:07:23,278
L�s from Bill.

1296
02:07:26,567 --> 02:07:28,080
Monk.

1297
02:07:47,007 --> 02:07:49,885
Citizens of the Five Points...

1298
02:07:50,367 --> 02:07:54,121
...Mr. Bill Cutting is attempting
to draw me into an argument...

1299
02:07:54,287 --> 02:07:58,678
...that would no doubt end in bloodshed
and the compromising of my office.

1300
02:07:59,327 --> 02:08:01,204
What do you think?

1301
02:08:02,087 --> 02:08:05,602
Should I engage in silence
this relic of the ancient law?

1302
02:08:05,767 --> 02:08:11,922
Or shall I be your chosen voice
in a new testament, in the new world?

1303
02:08:17,647 --> 02:08:19,365
There you are, Bill.

1304
02:08:20,927 --> 02:08:22,838
The people have spoken.

1305
02:08:24,287 --> 02:08:28,200
The very notion of violent reprisal
benumbs them.

1306
02:08:30,367 --> 02:08:31,925
Come on up.

1307
02:08:32,487 --> 02:08:35,763
Le�s see if we can resolve
our grievances the democratic way.

1308
02:08:58,087 --> 02:09:02,683
That, my friends,
is the minority vote.

1309
02:09:03,687 --> 02:09:07,566
Now you've tasted my mutton.
How do you like it?

1310
02:09:07,727 --> 02:09:09,046
Look.

1311
02:09:09,207 --> 02:09:11,641
I want you to see this.

1312
02:09:14,367 --> 02:09:16,403
This is you. Right here.

1313
02:09:16,567 --> 02:09:20,276
Notch 45, you Irish bog bastard.

1314
02:09:31,287 --> 02:09:34,643
Why don't you burn him,
see if his ashes turn green.

1315
02:09:39,727 --> 02:09:42,002
Fortune favors the bold!

1316
02:09:53,927 --> 02:09:57,840
- You killed an elected official?
- Who elected him?

1317
02:09:58,007 --> 02:10:01,044
You don't know what
you've done to yourself.

1318
02:10:06,327 --> 02:10:08,761
I know your works.

1319
02:10:09,367 --> 02:10:11,483
You are neither cold nor hot.

1320
02:10:11,647 --> 02:10:15,765
So because you are lukewarm,
I will spew you out of my mouth.

1321
02:10:17,287 --> 02:10:19,676
You can build your filthy world
without me.

1322
02:10:19,847 --> 02:10:22,202
I took the father.
Now I'll take the son.

1323
02:10:22,367 --> 02:10:27,077
You tell young Vallon I'm gonna
paint Paradise Square with his blood.

1324
02:10:27,327 --> 02:10:28,840
Two coats.

1325
02:10:29,407 --> 02:10:31,967
I'll festoon my bedchamber
with his guts.

1326
02:10:32,127 --> 02:10:34,482
As for you,
Mr. Tammany-fucking-Hall...

1327
02:10:34,647 --> 02:10:36,478
...you come down
to the Points again...

1328
02:10:36,647 --> 02:10:40,003
...and you'll be dispatched
by mine own hand.

1329
02:10:41,727 --> 02:10:46,881
Now get back to your celebration
and let me eat in peace. I paid you fair.

1330
02:11:09,727 --> 02:11:11,365
Stop.

1331
02:11:12,327 --> 02:11:13,840
Raise.

1332
02:11:55,167 --> 02:11:57,317
You son of a bitch!

1333
02:12:01,007 --> 02:12:02,918
Challenge.

1334
02:12:04,247 --> 02:12:06,522
Challenge accepted.

1335
02:12:56,087 --> 02:12:59,363
And then it came,
the first day of the draft.

1336
02:12:59,527 --> 02:13:04,681
Thomas O'Neill. Andrew Lewis.
Joseph flynn.

1337
02:13:04,847 --> 02:13:07,919
They read out the draftees ' names
like they was dead already.

1338
02:13:08,087 --> 02:13:12,239
Andrew Martin. J.B. Gleason.

1339
02:13:12,407 --> 02:13:15,046
- The O'Connell Guard.
- The Plug Uglies.

1340
02:13:15,207 --> 02:13:18,324
- As for us, the tribes were gathered.
- Forty Thieves.

1341
02:13:18,647 --> 02:13:21,036
- The Chichesters.
- The drums was beating.

1342
02:13:21,207 --> 02:13:22,481
The Dead Rabbits.

1343
02:13:22,647 --> 02:13:25,480
- The American Guard.
- The Atlantic Guard.

1344
02:13:25,647 --> 02:13:28,207
- The Slaughter Housers.
- The Bowery Boys.

1345
02:13:28,367 --> 02:13:30,597
The Confederation
of American Natives.

1346
02:13:31,967 --> 02:13:33,036
James Mooney.

1347
02:13:33,207 --> 02:13:36,563
But all we could see
was the hand in front of us.

1348
02:13:36,727 --> 02:13:38,638
Sean O'Connell.

1349
02:13:38,807 --> 02:13:42,800
G.W. Morris. John Doyle.

1350
02:13:42,967 --> 02:13:45,527
- When?
- Whenever you like.

1351
02:13:45,687 --> 02:13:47,803
- Daybreak tomorrow.
- Ground?

1352
02:13:47,967 --> 02:13:50,003
Paradise Square.

1353
02:13:50,167 --> 02:13:51,885
Weapons?

1354
02:13:52,047 --> 02:13:57,075
- That I leave up to you.
- Bricks, bats, axes, knives...

1355
02:13:57,407 --> 02:13:58,806
Pistols?

1356
02:14:00,287 --> 02:14:01,686
No pistols.

1357
02:14:02,767 --> 02:14:04,723
Good boy.

1358
02:14:07,167 --> 02:14:10,079
The terms are resolved.
The council's concluded.

1359
02:14:11,927 --> 02:14:15,806
Thomas McEvoy. W.H. Miles.

1360
02:14:15,967 --> 02:14:18,925
- To hell with your damned draft!
- Give them hellfire, boys!

1361
02:14:19,087 --> 02:14:20,566
Rip them apart!

1362
02:14:27,327 --> 02:14:29,761
Kill the rich bastards!

1363
02:14:35,727 --> 02:14:37,285
Uptown!

1364
02:14:38,807 --> 02:14:40,525
You're not getting my son!

1365
02:14:45,847 --> 02:14:48,407
Uptown at the draft office...

1366
02:14:48,567 --> 02:14:53,402
...the cops broke a few skulls,
and everybody run away.

1367
02:14:54,367 --> 02:14:56,676
But the word was spreading...

1368
02:14:56,847 --> 02:14:58,644
...and the dark.

1369
02:14:59,767 --> 02:15:01,086
Up on Fifth Avenue...

1370
02:15:01,247 --> 02:15:04,444
...the Schermerhorns and their mob
breathed a little easy.

1371
02:15:04,607 --> 02:15:07,485
Just a brief burst of anger
over Mr. Lincoln's draft.

1372
02:15:07,647 --> 02:15:09,797
Entirely justifiable in my view.

1373
02:15:09,967 --> 02:15:13,516
- There are two sides to that question...
- There are several sides...

1374
02:15:13,687 --> 02:15:16,121
...but only one right side,
as with any question...

1375
02:15:16,287 --> 02:15:18,482
...that involves the abuse
of executive power.

1376
02:15:18,647 --> 02:15:20,877
In any case, Mr. Greeley...

1377
02:15:21,047 --> 02:15:23,641
...we can all be thankful
that it wasn't any worse.

1378
02:15:23,807 --> 02:15:26,799
It may be worse yet. I saw them.
I don't know what to think.

1379
02:15:26,967 --> 02:15:30,039
Now what is it that you are
so fond of saying, Mr. Tweed?

1380
02:15:30,207 --> 02:15:32,562
Mr. Greeley, you won't like this.
But what is it?

1381
02:15:32,727 --> 02:15:33,716
I don't remember.

1382
02:15:33,887 --> 02:15:38,438
"You can always hire one half
of the poor to kill the other half."

1383
02:15:48,287 --> 02:15:50,517
I've come to say goodbye.

1384
02:15:50,687 --> 02:15:53,520
I've booked passage for California.

1385
02:15:55,927 --> 02:15:58,600
Jenny, give me one more day,
and I'll go with you.

1386
02:15:58,767 --> 02:16:00,997
You'll be dead by then.

1387
02:16:01,527 --> 02:16:04,837
- Well, what would you have me do?
- I don't know.

1388
02:16:07,367 --> 02:16:10,962
- This will all be finished tomorrow.
- No, it won't.

1389
02:16:12,527 --> 02:16:14,006
No.

1390
02:16:14,407 --> 02:16:17,399
This whole place
is gonna burn anyway.

1391
02:16:25,127 --> 02:16:29,678
I've heard that the poor are going
from door to door in the Five Points...

1392
02:16:29,847 --> 02:16:33,237
...asking those supporters
who wish to see further riots...

1393
02:16:33,407 --> 02:16:36,399
...to place a lighted candle
in the window.

1394
02:16:36,807 --> 02:16:38,798
Irish, Poles, Germans, all of them.

1395
02:16:39,567 --> 02:16:45,517
Mr. Greeley, the city is not mad.
I prophesy a very dark night.

1396
02:17:06,847 --> 02:17:10,522
Nobody goes to work today!
We'll shut the factories down!

1397
02:17:10,687 --> 02:17:14,919
When the sun rose next,
the city had split in half.

1398
02:17:15,087 --> 02:17:16,839
From all over New York they came:

1399
02:17:17,007 --> 02:17:19,726
Ironworkers, factory boys,
street cleaners...

1400
02:17:19,887 --> 02:17:21,400
...Irish, Polish, German...

1401
02:17:21,567 --> 02:17:24,240
...anyone who never cared
about slavery or the Union...

1402
02:17:24,407 --> 02:17:26,875
...anyone who couldn 't buy his way out.

1403
02:17:27,047 --> 02:17:29,925
"Let the sons of the rich
go and die, " they cried.

1404
02:17:30,087 --> 02:17:32,999
"Let the sons of the poor stay home."

1405
02:17:34,327 --> 02:17:36,397
The earth was shaking now.

1406
02:17:36,567 --> 02:17:39,161
But I was about my father's business.

1407
02:17:44,047 --> 02:17:46,163
A bunch of fifth Avenue scums!

1408
02:17:53,047 --> 02:17:57,359
Almighty Lord,
you are the dagger in my hand.

1409
02:17:58,607 --> 02:18:00,882
Guide my hand
on this day of vengeance.

1410
02:18:01,047 --> 02:18:04,881
We give thanks to the Lord,
for he is good.

1411
02:18:05,047 --> 02:18:09,199
With you, the swift cannot flee,
nor the strong escape.

1412
02:18:09,367 --> 02:18:13,360
Let my sword devour until its thirst
is quenched with blood...

1413
02:18:13,527 --> 02:18:15,438
...and my enemies sleep forever.

1414
02:18:15,607 --> 02:18:17,882
For you are the Lord God of Retribution.

1415
02:18:18,047 --> 02:18:20,402
For the Lord crushes the wicked.

1416
02:18:20,567 --> 02:18:23,081
The Lord is merciful...

1417
02:18:23,687 --> 02:18:27,316
...and his love endures forever.

1418
02:18:27,847 --> 02:18:29,166
- Amen.
- Amen.

1419
02:18:29,327 --> 02:18:30,442
Amen.

1420
02:18:36,207 --> 02:18:39,119
- Run away, you sons of bitches!
- Come on out!

1421
02:18:41,567 --> 02:18:45,526
- Upstairs! Get the women upstairs!
- Father! Father!

1422
02:18:49,207 --> 02:18:51,596

16th Precinct: All the stores
are closing on Eighth Avenue...

1426
02:19:01,367 --> 02:19:03,278
...from fear of the mob in 17th Street.

1427
02:19:03,447 --> 02:19:05,836
Show us what you got,
you cowardly bastards!

- Tear Tammany down!

1432
02:19:24,287 --> 02:19:27,359
The marshal's office is burning down.
The police is of no avail.

1433
02:19:27,527 --> 02:19:28,562
Show yourself, Tweed!

02:24:18,167 --> 02:24:19,600
Advance!

1488
02:24:20,327 --> 02:24:22,158
Bill!

1489
02:24:25,127 --> 02:24:26,480
I can't walk!

1490
02:24:28,207 --> 02:24:29,686
Get up!

1491
02:25:30,647 --> 02:25:31,966
Fire!

1492
02:25:59,127 --> 02:26:02,802
- Bastards!
- Shang! Shang, hold off!

1493
02:26:33,847 --> 02:26:35,883
Thank God.

1494
02:26:36,807 --> 02:26:39,526
I die a true American.

1495
02:28:36,527 --> 02:28:38,961
Tomorrow morning,
get our people down to the docks.

1496
02:28:40,007 --> 02:28:44,364
I want every man and woman coming off
the boats given hot soup and bread.

1497
02:28:48,687 --> 02:28:52,043
We're burying a lot of votes
down here tonight.

1498
02:29:08,847 --> 02:29:13,477
In the end, they put candles
on the bodies so 's their friends...

1499
02:29:13,647 --> 02:29:17,686
...if they had any,
could know them in the dark.

1500
02:29:18,807 --> 02:29:22,117
The city did this free of charge.

1501
02:29:23,127 --> 02:29:28,918
Shang, Jimmy Spoils,
Hell-Cat, McGloin and more.

1502
02:29:30,367 --> 02:29:34,645
Friend or foe,
it didn 't make no difference now.

1503
02:29:53,367 --> 02:29:59,124
It was four days and nights before the
worst of the mob was finally put down.

1504
02:30:00,127 --> 02:30:02,687
We never knew how many
New Yorkers died that week...

1505
02:30:02,847 --> 02:30:05,520
...before the city was finally delivered.

1506
02:30:06,847 --> 02:30:11,716
My father told me we was all born
of blood and tribulation.

1507
02:30:12,807 --> 02:30:16,925
And so then too was our great city.

1508
02:30:19,727 --> 02:30:24,278
But for those of us what lived
and died in them furious days...

1509
02:30:24,447 --> 02:30:29,680
...it was like everything we knew
was mightily swept away.

1510
02:30:30,447 --> 02:30:33,439
And no matter what they did
to build the city up again...

1511
02:30:35,607 --> 02:30:38,167
...for the rest of time...

1512
02:30:39,087 --> 02:30:43,205
...it would be like no one even knew
we was ever here.
