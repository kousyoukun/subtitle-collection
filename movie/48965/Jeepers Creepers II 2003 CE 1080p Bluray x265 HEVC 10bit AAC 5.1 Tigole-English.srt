1
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,995
Billy! You get
number three up now!

2
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,539
Don't come in to
eat before you do.

3
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,006
Check the other two. Make
sure they're wired up good.

4
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:15,260
I don't want them blowin' over
again, the first big wind.

5
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,603
Lot of good they're doin'.

6
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,006
Billy, you been messing
with the post puncher?

7
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,507
No!

8
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,636
I told you what would happen if
you screw around with this thing.

9
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,471
I said I didn't!

10
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,521
Don't want 'em
blowin' down again.

11
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,148
Big wind, my ass.

12
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,151
You're the only
big wind out here.

13
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,446
Jacky!

14
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,575
You been messing with the
damn post puncher again?

15
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,826
No!

16
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,460
Billy, you little asshole! Why don't
you rat yourself out for a change?

17
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,003
What did I do?

18
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,088
You little butt sniff.

19
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,757
I ought to come out there
and kick your ass!

20
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,384
You Wish!

21
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,862
Yeah, go on, Mac. Go bite him
in the ass for me, Macky boy.

22
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,508
God! Would you shut up?

23
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,300
Jacky!

24
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,136
Jacky!

25
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,555
Jacky!

26
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,937
Jacky!

27
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,301
Billy!

28
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,932
Where are you?

29
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,101
Billy!

30
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,562
Daddy!

31
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,564
Billy!

32
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,447
Let go! Help me, Dad!

33
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,698
Billy!

34
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,326
Help! Help, help, Dad, help!

35
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,120
Billy!

36
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,165
Help! Help me! Dad!

37
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,377
Billy!

38
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,464
Dad! Let go!

39
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,631
Billy!

40
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,383
Daddy!

41
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,759
Billy!

42
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,889
<i>Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!</i>

43
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,852
<i>Go Bantams! Go Bantams!</i>

44
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,772
Go Bantams!

45
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,776
Tough as nails, hard as rocks,

46
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,861
we are Bannon's fighting cocks!

47
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,197
Fighting Bantams,
tough as nails!

48
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,366
Bow down now or kiss our tails!

49
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,660
Out for blood,
we're lean and mean!

50
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,787
Bannon County's death machine!

51
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,416
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!

52
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,544
Bannon Bantams power and might!

53
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,879
Bannon Bantams, fight, fight, fight!
Incoming!

54
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,923
Bannon Bantams, we're the word!

55
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,217
You don't mess
with a mighty bird!

56
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,261
Down the court,
we'll clean your clock.

57
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,471
Better not mess
with the fighting cock!

58
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,892
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!

59
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,978
Bannon Bantams, wings of steel!

60
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,063
Bannon Bantams.
Kill! Kill! Kill!

61
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,148
Who was that? Don't even ask!

62
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,109
These big Bantams kick your ass!

63
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,403
Strike like
lightning from the sky!

64
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,280
Screaming out our battle cry!

65
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:55,076
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!

66
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,412
Go Bantams!

67
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,498
Go Bantams!

68
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,260
Hard as rocks, we are
Bannon's fighting cocks!

69
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,596
How long can they keep this up?

70
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,765
Forever. They have a fight song
with the word "cock" in it.

71
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,853
Why aren't you sitting
with your honey?

72
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,108
Someone should tell him he just
won the state championship.

73
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,111
I have a feeling he didn't
get to play enough.

74
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,072
Well, shouldn't you
be sitting with him?

75
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,367
After a game, he says he
needs to be with the guys.

76
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,369
You kill his post-game buzz?

77
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,121
Basically.

78
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,957
If they lose, it's a
totally different thing.

79
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,334
Can't pry him off me.

80
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,477
Shit!

81
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,607
Okay, everybody stay down.
Sit tight.

82
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,320
Son of a bitch.

83
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,255
What in the hell
would you call that?

84
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,427
Ouch!

85
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,781
I don't know, but
whatever it is,

86
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,890
it's sharp as a son of a bitch!

87
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,609
What in the hell
are we looking at?

88
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,696
It's sharp enough to flatten
a tire, whatever it is.

89
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,906
You know how thick
that rubber is?

90
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,825
It had to be shot into
it like a bullet.

91
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,327
Jesus Christ! The damn
thing has got teeth in it.

92
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,914
They can't just whip the jack
out and pump this mother up?

93
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,376
Driver can't change a flat on a bus.
They need a mechanic.

94
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,336
- So?
- So?

95
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,880
Do you see any
mechanics around here?

96
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,507
You sucked so bad today,
Deaundre,

97
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,385
they're probably saying
you gotta change the flat.

98
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,645
<i>Where she'll
give us the latest update on...</i>

99
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,724
Izzy.

100
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:27,061
<i>A continuing story we call,
"The Horror in Poho County."</i>

101
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,688
- <i>Sheila?
- Hey, Poho update.</i>

102
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,898
<i>Well, Peter, the fire
which gutted an old church</i>

103
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,984
<i>south of Pertwilla
four days ago,</i>

104
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,737
<i>continues to offer up
a gruesome bounty.</i>

105
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,322
<i>County sheriffs excavating
the charred ruins say</i>

106
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:42,201
<i>the body count is
now up well past 300.</i>

107
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,580
<i>County coroners say the bodies
were found stitched to each other,</i>

108
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,583
<i>covering the basement's
walls and ceiling.</i>

109
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,585
<i>One on-the-scene
witness called it</i>

110
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,921
a <i>human tapestry
of torture and sadism</i>

111
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,591
<i>and a sight he
will never forget.</i>

112
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,218
<i>Sheila, the details keep
getting stranger and stranger</i>

113
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,221
<i>every day this week, it seems.
Any new information?</i>

114
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,100
<i>Some of the corpses they had
found had false teeth made out of wood.</i>

115
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:10,855
<i>That means some of the bodies they're
finding down there are over 200 years old.</i>

116
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,608
<i>But, Peter, it's the
condition of the cadavers</i>

117
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,610
<i>that's the strangest
fact of all.</i>

118
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,945
<i>The County coroner's
office reported yesterday</i>

119
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,073
<i>that they have yet to find
any one complete body.</i>

120
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,034
Believe that, man?
No, they're making it up.

121
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,578
<i>Each one missing either an
external limb or an internal organ.</i>

122
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,788
<i>What connection this has...</i>

123
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:33,169
This is 226 on East Nine.
We are down and disabled.

124
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,796
Home base, do you read me?

125
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,049
You get a good look at
the points on this thing?

126
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,052
It's either ivory
or some kind of bone.

127
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,515
Throw that damn thing away
before you need a tetanus shot.

128
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,079
Pop! Pop, he dropped something.

129
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,544
Pop?

130
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,465
It was out in the corn, Papa.

131
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,468
Here, look at it.

132
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:28,260
We're out on East Nine. We
are down and disabled. Come back.

133
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,391
Say again, this is 226.

134
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,642
Anyone read me?

135
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,104
We are down and disabled
out on East Nine. Come back.

136
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,945
We gotta be in some kind
of sun spot or something.

137
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,613
There's no signal getting out.

138
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,782
It's gonna be
dark in about an hour.

139
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,909
Well, we still got
five tires on the ground,

140
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:56,080
which means we can probably limp
home if we keep to goin' slow.

141
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,752
Say again. This is 226.
Anyone read me?

142
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,088
All of you at the same time?

143
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,759
Lady cheerleaders?

144
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,637
That's not smoke I smell, is it?

145
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,973
Minxie.

146
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,517
There's not a girl
in the world these days

147
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,771
stupid enough to kill themselves
by sucking on cancer sticks.

148
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,273
Am I right?

149
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,449
Back on the bus, ladies.

150
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,210
You saw me, right?
Run that fast break?

151
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,795
You see that?

152
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,340
Yeah, I saw it.
Anybody gonna read about it?

153
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,179
Why you give old Dante
back there so much ink?

154
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,849
I'm serious.

155
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,994
People are starting to think
that you're sweet on him.

156
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,895
Really? I heard that was you.

157
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,772
Hey, it's okay if you are, man.

158
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,774
I mean, live and
let love, right?

159
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,318
Why don't you piss on
somebody else's shoes, Jake?

160
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,088
Hey, shouldn't you be folding towels
somewhere or sniffing jock straps?

161
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,740
You think you can manage
the team, Super Genius?

162
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,534
Was I even talking to you,
Jock Strap Boy?

163
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,620
Hey, eat shit, Jake! God!

164
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,124
So this is all because what, I
don't write enough about you?

165
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,786
You know what the story is
on your scars there, right?

166
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,003
No, tell me.

167
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,465
You got into a fight
when you snuck into a bar.

168
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,633
So?

169
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,802
A gay bar, bro.

170
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,723
You do know what they call
you, don't you, Izzy?

171
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,016
That's my name.

172
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,018
Or isn't he?

173
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:50,694
Hey, let's not make this a
social event out there, everybody.

174
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,823
Back on the bus, gentlemen.
We're moving.

175
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,783
Hey, does that
come in a man's size?

176
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,203
That means you, too,
Kimball. Let's go!

177
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,912
Smooth move, Big K! Nice, man!

178
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,916
Tippi Hedren, man!

179
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,168
Kimball!

180
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,629
Stop clowning around and
get your ass back on the bus!

181
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,177
Off the top, gentlemen.
Assholes and elbows. Let's go.

182
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,424
You know, you could talk about it.
It might help a little bit.

183
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,594
What did I play today,
12 minutes?

184
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,389
Well, it was a great 12 minutes.

185
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,642
Hanna's got it in for me.

186
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,730
Him and his little token
white boy, Barnes.

187
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,025
I don't know,

188
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,863
maybe I got the wrong skin color
to get equal play on this team.

189
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,199
I know you don't mean that.

190
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,119
Maybe they just
wanted to make sure

191
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,763
everyone got a chance
to play in the championship.

192
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,166
Everyone's not the reason why
we made it to the championship.

193
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,795
Half the losers on this bus had nothing
to do with us making it to state. I did.

194
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,924
What the fuck
are you looking at?

195
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,634
Jesus!

196
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,219
Jesus Christ!

197
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,577
Don't tell me.

198
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,860
- We blew the other one.
- How?

199
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,957
Back down, everybody. Sit tight.

200
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,878
Shit! We've got to break out the
flares and get these kids off the bus.

201
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,381
Hey, hey, hey!

202
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,568
You wanna sit in here and hope
somebody doesn't come along

203
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,594
plowin' into us doing 90,

204
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,098
All right. Duane,
you clear the bus.

205
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,517
I'll set the flares.

206
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,270
What is that, a flare gun?

207
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,982
Plan on being lost
at sea in this thing?

208
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,692
You makin' fun of my lock box?

209
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:49,947
'Cause everything in this thing has
saved my sweet ass at least once.

210
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,158
I don't believe it.

211
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,914
All right. Bring your coats
and stay in a group.

212
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,381
This is Betty Borman out on 226.

213
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,467
We're broke down on East Nine, middle
of Kissel County. Anyone read me?

214
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,011
Want me to help you push it
off the road before I go?

215
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,255
I don't think we can move it.

216
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,348
It's on a bare rim in the back.

217
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,393
If you'd let the highway patrol
know, we'd appreciate it.

218
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,644
Sure.

219
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:39,079
Come on, guys. Come on.
Let's go. Off the road.

220
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:47,129
Come on, guys. Everyone on the shoulder.
Everyone stays in a group.

221
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,674
This side of the fence.

222
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,927
This side of the fence.

223
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,013
Scott, come on.

224
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,689
Everyone stays back
and off the road. Now!

225
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,612
Stuck in the side
of the tire again.

226
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,868
Oh, God.

227
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:23,040
Don't tell me that's a belly button
in the middle of that thing.

228
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,542
Minxie, stay off the road.

229
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,129
That's everybody. Off the road.

230
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,591
Get everyone back on the bus.

231
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,861
You just said they shouldn't be...
I know what I just said.

232
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,347
But there's something goin' on
out here and I don't like it.

233
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,473
I think if we just stay...

234
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,169
Coach?

235
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,425
What the...

236
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,514
What?

237
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,766
Where the hell's the coach?

238
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,685
Charlie?

239
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,402
Charlie!

240
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,539
Get everyone back inside
and close the doors.

241
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,792
Okay, champions, getting
back on the Betty Boop.

242
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,895
Bucky, get on the two-way,
see if you can raise anyone.

243
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,254
I'm talking to you, Scotty!

244
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,523
What the hell happened
to the coach?

245
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,883
Get everyone back on board
and close those doors.

246
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,221
Do it, Scotty.

247
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,112
All right. You heard him.
Assholes and elbows.

248
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,355
Everybody back on the bus.

249
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,192
Charlie?

250
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,779
Charlie!

251
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,745
Hurry up! On the bus.
Now! Now! Now!

252
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,580
I repeat. Bus number 226,

253
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,665
broke down on East Nine.
Charlie!

254
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,710
We have an emergency situation out here.
Does anybody read me?

255
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,341
This is bus number 226. We
are broke down on East Nine.

256
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:18,924
Jake.

257
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,891
What happened?

258
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,102
What did you see?
What did you see?

259
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,605
Come on! Did you see
something or not?

260
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,235
She flew away.

261
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,341
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

262
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,450
What I just said. People
don't fly the fuck away!

263
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,577
Sit down, Scott. What the
hell's goin' on out there?

264
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,081
I said sit the fuck down and
shut up, God damn it! Now!

265
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,587
You, too, Jake. Everybody.

266
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,392
Go sit down, Scott.

267
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,687
You got a problem with me?
No. You got one with me?

268
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,022
- Do I what?
- You heard me.

269
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,859
We don't have time for bullshit, Scotty.
Go sit down!

270
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,669
Scotty!

271
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,131
What the fuck?

272
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,795
Get the fucking doors!
Get the fucking doors!

273
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,475
Get the fucking doors!

274
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,266
What was it?

275
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,520
Scotty, what the fuck was it?

276
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,357
Scotty, come on!

277
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,860
Scotty, we just... I don't
know what it was, all right?

278
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,042
It had wings.

279
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,712
Big fuckin' wings!

280
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,239
<i>Central, this is unit 17.</i>

281
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,574
<i>We did a drive-by
of the general area.</i>

282
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,744
<i>Also found no evidence
of forced entry. Over.</i>

283
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,207
<i>0-3-2, we are 10-7 Opper's
Diner for a little coffee and pie.</i>

284
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,376
<i>Do you copy that, Central?</i>

285
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,088
<i>This is Central.
Copy that, 0-3-2.</i>

286
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:52,512
<i>All units, anybody else getting
some weird stuff out Kissel County way?</i>

287
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:56,933
<i>I just got two calls, 10 miles
apart, both reporting abductions.</i>

288
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:01,855
<i>All units, be informed,
this should be strictly 10-36 information.</i>

289
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,025
<i>Someone burning a
marijuana field out there tonight?</i>

290
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,402
<i>'Cause these two stories
are way, way out, baby.</i>

291
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,821
<i>Roger that, 0-3-6.</i>

292
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,740
Jacky! Kissel County!

293
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,285
<i>If you ask me, this is Poho related.
Repeat, Poho related.</i>

294
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,971
<i>And you all
know what I'm talkin' about.</i>

295
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,208
This is Andy Buck.
Can anybody hear me?

296
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,377
Nobody's phone works.
Nobody's fucking phone works.

297
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:28,423
We are stuck in a broken-down
school bus out on East Nine.

298
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,383
And we are in serious trouble.

299
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,093
Do you read me?

300
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,933
Come on, is anybody
even out there?

301
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,101
This is Andy Buck.

302
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:44,731
We are stuck in a broken-down
school bus out on East Nine.

303
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,192
Javelins?

304
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,153
We've got spears on this bus?

305
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,072
Sticks.

306
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,783
You wanna wait around so you can
poke at that thing with sticks?

307
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,594
That thing shows up here
again and I'd rather have

308
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,378
a sharp stick in my hand
than nothin' at all.

309
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:03,333
Hey, guys, Betty's flare gun.
A bunch of flares for it, too.

310
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,544
Who says we wait around?
I'm serious.

311
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,881
Scotty, you're not talking
about getting off this bus?

312
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,468
You see that?

313
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,782
That means that there's a farm down
at the end of this road somewhere

314
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,975
and that's as far as anybody
would have to get to.

315
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,897
With that thing out there?

316
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,109
Scotty!

317
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,694
With that thing out there?

318
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,131
Scotty! That thing
hasn't been back

319
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,198
here in almost an hour.

320
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,468
That doesn't mean that it's
not still up there somewhere.

321
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,035
And that doesn't mean
that it is.

322
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,159
Hey, this isn't about who
can run the fastest, okay?

323
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,956
Or being a pussy.
What is your problem?

324
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,249
You tell me, Izzy or isn't he?

325
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,518
Hey, check yourselves!
Both of you!

326
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,584
Do I make you nervous?

327
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:47,978
Thinking you're
gonna come on to me

328
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,980
and every other swinging dick
on this bus makes me nervous.

329
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,132
Yeah, it makes you
fucking stupid, too.

330
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,927
Stop it!

331
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,138
Stop it!

332
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,931
Scotty, come on.

333
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,623
You get that hand off of me or we're gonna
have one more missing person out here.

334
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,357
There's nothing about
any of us on this bus

335
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,193
that's more important
than sticking together.

336
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,654
It's the only way we're
gonna get through this.

337
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,240
You wanna play cock
of the walk now?

338
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,326
Now's not the time
for this shit, Scotty.

339
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,079
Big K, sit. I'm serious.

340
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,456
Wanna play
cock of the walk, bro?

341
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,213
Why do I think you wanna
call me something else?

342
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,885
Wanna call me something else,
Scotty?

343
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,554
'Cause I don't think you get
I can see you thinking it,

344
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,680
whether you say it or not.

345
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,483
Just stop it right now!
Both of you stop it.

346
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,896
You guys all worked
together today to win a ball game.

347
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,940
Now that something
really serious happens,

348
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,359
you can't even be
civil to each other?

349
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,612
You tell him, not me.

350
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,448
Whatever your trip is,
we ain't got time for this shit.

351
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,825
We should all be looking for
ways we can defend ourselves

352
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,077
until help gets here.

353
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,604
We have got to move
this piece of shit!

354
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,689
On what, the rims?

355
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,832
Can you drive this thing or not?

356
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,734
We wouldn't get two feet, man.
What do you want me to do?

357
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,709
What the hell does it want?

358
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,839
What the fuck?

359
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,883
Is it looking at me?

360
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:51,602
Whatever it is,
it's a smell freak, man.

361
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,245
Get that light Off it.

362
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,978
Hey, don't shoot that
thing in here, man.

363
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,303
He's right. It will fill this
place up like a smoke bomb.

364
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,655
Did that just come off the door?

365
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,800
Bucky, get on those front doors
and get ready to open them.

366
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,301
What, you think we're
gonna run outside?

367
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,660
If it fucking comes inside.

368
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,226
Minxie?

369
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,230
Minxie?

370
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,906
Minxie? Minxie?

371
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,325
Minxie?

372
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,502
Minxie?

373
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,013
<i>Takes it all. Eats everything.</i>

374
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,599
<i>He takes it all.
He knows no mercy.</i>

375
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:35,076
Every twenty-third spring,
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

376
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,915
Eat what?

377
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,087
Eat what?

378
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,300
Eat us.

379
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,231
Minx?

380
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,569
Are you okay?

381
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,488
Look at me.

382
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,050
I thought you were gone, girl,
you passed out.

383
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,826
Look at me.

384
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,244
Are you okay?

385
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,373
Your eyes went all the way
in the back of your head.

386
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,457
I think he's gone, man.

387
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,501
I'm willing to bet money on it.

388
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,172
You willing to bet stepping off this bus?
'Cause that's the real bet.

389
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,091
How long's it been?

390
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,719
It's gone.

391
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,154
It came, it did its thing.
It went away.

392
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,938
It went away, but
what the hell was it doing?

393
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,266
What do you think it was doing?

394
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,940
He was picking people out.

395
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,822
What?

396
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,075
It can smell
something in people.

397
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,160
In their fear.

398
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,746
Something that helps
it pick people out.

399
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,498
Pick people out for what?

400
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,210
I don't understand how you
would know that, sweetie.

401
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,882
A dead boy told me.

402
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,514
I think he was
trying to warn me.

403
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,143
He was trying to warn all of us.

404
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,747
This thing has been around
for thousands of years

405
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,814
and that nothing has
been able to kill it.

406
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,024
This is a dream you had?

407
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,919
Well, the boy was dead. So, yes, I'm
assuming that it was a dream, Scotty.

408
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,945
You were waving pom-poms
at people this morning.

409
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,423
Now all of a sudden,
you're a psychic hotline?

410
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,490
I don't know!

411
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,284
You wanna explain it
to me? Because I can't.

412
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,335
That boy was trying to warn us

413
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,254
that by morning it has to
go back into the earth...

414
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,006
Oh, come on.

415
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,385
Into the ground
for 23 more years.

416
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,932
And then what? Lives
happily ever after?

417
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,911
Why don't you clean
out your bong, all right?

418
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,478
Scotty, just listen to her.

419
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:08,646
It is coming back.

420
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,398
This is a dream she had, Rhonda.

421
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,541
What, are you gonna believe it?

422
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,485
And it doesn't matter if
we're hiding on this bus

423
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,237
or if we're
hiding under our beds.

424
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,738
It'll find us.

425
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,659
The ones that it picked out.

426
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,344
Minx. Take it easy, okay?

427
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,935
The boy told me that

428
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:52,440
it can smell in our
fear, who it wants.

429
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:59,488
And what from them
it wants to eat.

430
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,713
Hello, is anyone out there?

431
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,008
Hello. We have
a serious problem out here.

432
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,511
We need help right away.
Can anybody hear me?

433
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,347
Is anybody out there, please?

434
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:29,018
We have a... This is Andy Buck,
we have a serious situation...

435
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,077
<i>Does anybody hear me?</i>

436
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,634
Dad!

437
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,430
Hello? Look, can you hear me?

438
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,140
226, are you still there?

439
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,517
<i>I'm so fucking still here.</i>

440
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,520
Okay, okay. Just say again
what you just told me.

441
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,003
<i>We're not playing
games here, right?</i>

442
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,898
Just say it, man!

443
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:02,653
We're trapped in a broken-down
school bus out on East Nine.

444
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,488
And something
is going to kill us

445
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,366
if we don't get help
out here right away.

446
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,784
Where on Nine East?

447
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,828
<i>In Kissel County.
Are you the cops?</i>

448
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,580
What's trying to kill you?

449
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,039
What are you talking about?

450
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,292
Just tell me,
are you the fucking cops?

451
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,296
<i>Look, now listen to me.
I'm already on the Nine.</i>

452
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,965
But it's a big highway
and so is Kissel County.

453
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,550
Are there any
landmarks near you?

454
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,135
Are you close to anything?

455
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,387
Yeah, I'm close to peeing
my fucking pants, man.

456
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,098
Can you just please tell
me that you're on the way?

457
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:36,604
I can't really judge the strength of
your signal but it doesn't sound close.

458
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,397
<i>What does that mean, man?</i>

459
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,774
It means it's gonna take
me a while to get to you.

460
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,653
Look, we kind of have a
time-critical situation here.

461
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,405
Roger that.

462
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,448
And please tell me that
you're coming with back-up

463
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,075
'cause if you're not the cops,

464
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,244
you gotta promise me
that you'll call them

465
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:55,456
and you'll tell them
that we're stuck out here.

466
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,166
I'll call them.

467
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,918
I'll call them right now.

468
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,836
But what you've
gotta do is hang on.

469
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,254
Can you do that?

470
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,672
Hang on!

471
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,810
Keep headed east.

472
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,983
Dad?

473
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,860
Just get us out there.

474
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,657
Do it.

475
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,094
Yes!

476
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,618
It's happening, man.
It's fucking happening!

477
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,068
We're being fucking rescued!

478
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,699
Help me! Get this thing off me!

479
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,212
Get this thing off me!

480
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,463
Look out!

481
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,542
Half its fucking head's gone.

482
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,392
Fuck.

483
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,817
You gotta be...
Fucking kidding me.

484
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,326
Get that door open.
Now's our chance.

485
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,622
It's dead, right?

486
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,457
Don't know. Don't care.

487
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,834
It won't open!

488
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,552
Stop Pushing on 'em!
They open in!

489
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,306
Something got screwed up!

490
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,442
Maybe it only opens
from the outside.

491
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,985
It's an emergency exit, idiot.

492
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,237
Then you fucking open it, man!

493
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:43,905
Get that door open.

494
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,752
How can fucking exits
not fucking work?

495
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,006
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

496
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,258
He jammed it.

497
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,803
We thought he was
trying to come in.

498
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,931
But this freaking thing was
making sure we couldn't get out.

499
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,067
Break the fucking doors!

500
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,149
Holy shit, man!

501
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,701
Hey, we can pry this thing open.

502
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,664
Give me a pole or a bar
or something metal.

503
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,750
Something big. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, that'll work.

504
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,848
Come on, D.

505
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,933
You need to get to this side.
Come on, everybody.

506
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,476
Come on!

507
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,023
This thing's like a fucking
shower curtain, man.

508
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,692
It's crazy.

509
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,657
Oh, man, show like
you got a pair.

510
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,492
Man, fuck you!

511
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,039
Everybody. Let's go.

512
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,551
Shower curtain?

513
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,471
This thing's like a fucking
piece of toilet paper.

514
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,638
What's it doing, Minx?

515
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,807
What's it doing, Minx?

516
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,810
What's it doing up there?

517
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,595
It just tore its head off.

518
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,304
It's time to go.

519
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,118
What are you talking about, man?
Help is coming.

520
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,520
The Nine is big.

521
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,105
Remember?

522
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,608
What if he's an hour away?

523
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,194
What if he's going
the wrong direction?

524
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,238
There are fucking
cops on the way, man.

525
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,657
And you want the rest of us to
sit underneath that big hole

526
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,244
in the roof and hope that thing
doesn't come crashing in here?

527
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:06,898
What do you mean,
"The rest of us"?

528
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,415
I mean...

529
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,626
It's time to stop being polite.

530
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,630
There are two classes
of people on this bus now.

531
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:19,551
It had its pick of
twenty of us back there

532
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,136
and it picked two.

533
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,888
Dante was one.

534
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,854
Another one was you, Jake.
God damn it, Scott...

535
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,645
And we all saw him
go for you, Bucky.

536
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,066
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

537
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,026
Two classes of people?

538
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,404
What, the will be eaten
and the won't be eaten?

539
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,197
Fuck you, Scotty!

540
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,035
Minxie says this thing gets anybody
it picks out, no matter what.

541
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,662
Don't put me in this.

542
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,330
She also said that after tonight

543
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,000
it goes away and
for a long time, Scott.

544
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,336
You tell us, Minxie.

545
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,465
Are we safe if we can
hide out till morning?

546
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,192
Or is this thing gonna
come after these guys

547
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,259
with everything it's got

548
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:03,344
'cause it only has till morning?

549
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,356
We're screwed, right?

550
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,696
Yeah.

551
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,698
Scotty.

552
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,242
You're not talking about
throwing people off this bus?

553
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,647
It's funny you
should say that, D,

554
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,262
'cause the only other one we know
it picked out for sure was you.

555
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,456
Hold on a second!

556
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,792
We all saw the way it
sniffed you out back there.

557
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,556
You were the only one it gave tongue
action, man, and we all saw it.

558
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,296
Scotty!

559
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,882
I don't understand what
you're trying to do.

560
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,342
I'm trying to stay alive.

561
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,135
You're trying to split us up!

562
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,763
We have just dropped a notch

563
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,390
on the fucking food chain, man.

564
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:56,981
This is about
living or dying now.

565
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,483
Okay?

566
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,653
And if this bus
is the only thing

567
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,238
keeping that fucker
away from us,

568
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,115
how safe are we, you guys?

569
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,244
With everybody it's hungry
for sitting inside it.

570
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,458
I wanna see hands.

571
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,505
I wanna see hands.

572
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:25,176
'Cause as shitty a deal
as it is, I gotta say,

573
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,053
I'd like you,

574
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:30,390
Bucky and Jake
off this bus, man.

575
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,602
Now, you listen to me,
you piece of shit!

576
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,773
He looked at you, too, bro.

577
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,610
I saw him and you did, too.

578
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,823
He looked right
at you and smiled.

579
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,410
And when you made Jake
take the lights off it,

580
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,853
he could've looked at you twice
and licked its fucking lips,

581
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,455
but we don't know that.

582
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,750
So you keep your
little black list.

583
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,089
'Cause when he takes you
out and I hope he does,

584
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:08,845
I'm gonna be the one getting as far
away from your sorry ass as I can.

585
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,811
Time to go is right.

586
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,648
I'm gonna go find that farm.

587
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:22,233
Then I'm going with you.

588
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,360
You know I'm coming.

589
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:27,989
You wanna keep this bus?

590
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:30,909
Then you sit in it.

591
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,702
Right under that big hole.

592
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,538
See how long you last.

593
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,377
Look, I'm sorry, D.

594
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,379
You are so right about that.

595
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,595
Come on, guys.

596
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,431
Come on. Help is on the way.
Why are we splitting up?

597
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:57,268
He said he was coming. We're gonna
leave and he's gonna pull up.

598
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:00,647
This bus is a deathtrap, Bucky.
Use your head.

599
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,482
You're really gonna
let them go alone?

600
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,626
What, do you wanna go with them?

601
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,109
We don't know who it picked out.

602
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,695
Jesus Christ,
it looked at everyone!

603
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:12,867
Scotty, let go of me.

604
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,118
Let go of you?

605
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:15,954
Let go of me.

606
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,218
Fuck!

607
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,059
Rho, tell me you're
really walkin' away from me.

608
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,437
You used me, you used all of us.

609
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,856
All you care about is yourself.

610
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,235
Rho! You want to know, Scotty,
what I found out today?

611
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,989
When people get really scared, it's
just like when they get drunk.

612
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,491
The real person
comes to the surface.

613
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:57,286
We could've protected D and Jake and
all of us if we'd stuck together.

614
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,414
You know, like in a team?

615
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,041
Hey!

616
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,017
What are you doing?

617
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,853
Jonny, you little cocksucker,
I will fucking fry you, man!

618
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,856
You open these goddamn doors!
You open it right now!

619
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:28,067
Jonny! Open
the fucking doors, man!

620
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,777
Open the doors!

621
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,906
This is my bus, too, man!

622
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,789
Run!

623
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,355
Oh, God!

624
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,910
Run! He's right behind you, D.

625
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,670
Get back! Get off! Break off!

626
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,412
- Shit!
- Hold on. Hold on.

627
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,832
Hold still!

628
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,001
Stop moving! Stop!

629
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,046
Come on, Scotty!
You're hurting him.

630
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,465
You're hurting him.

631
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,387
- Stop! Pull it out!
- Hold on! Hold on!

632
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,765
Stop it! Keep back.
Stop moving!

633
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:24,809
- It's in there like it's welded!
- Stop! Stop.

634
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,477
Pull that out!

635
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:29,313
You're hurting him.
You're hurting him.

636
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,857
Stop it! Scotty, stop it!

637
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,860
- Shut up! Okay, hold him. Hold him.
- Scotty, stop it! Scotty!

638
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,528
Scotty, hold still! Hold him!

639
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:38,906
- Stop it! Scotty!
- Hold still!

640
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,292
Oh, God! God!

641
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,838
Please, hurry!
Oh, God, please help!

642
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,507
D, I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry!

643
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,676
Oh, please take it out!

644
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:12,190
Scotty! Scotty! Scotty! Scotty!

645
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:16,402
Scotty! Scotty! Scotty! Scotty!

646
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,142
What is it, boy? What is it?

647
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,694
Papa!

648
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,205
Go! Go!

649
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,430
Where did you come from?

650
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,976
From that bus?

651
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,354
How far up ahead?

652
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,443
Come on. Answer me.

653
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,737
It doesn't matter.

654
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:46,909
There's no one on the bus
and you can't kill it.

655
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,331
Jacky, get the dog inside.

656
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,002
Look, you can't stop it!

657
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:59,463
You get in the cabin with Jack Jr.
You stay down till this is over.

658
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,424
This will never be over.

659
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:05,886
It doesn't matter what you do.

660
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:12,143
It'll be back, 23
years from now,

661
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,854
23 years from then.

662
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:21,527
Get us to that bus.

663
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,418
Jonny?

664
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,130
Jonny?

665
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,099
What was that?

666
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,106
Jonny.

667
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:05,988
Bucky! What're you doing here?

668
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,282
What are you doing here?

669
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,119
You let her in, Jonny?

670
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,959
Have you seen anybody else?

671
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,879
What are you doing?

672
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,549
That thing is after you, Bucky.

673
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:28,386
Hey, there's no farm
out there, man. I must...

674
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,554
I must've run 10 miles all
over this fucking valley.

675
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:34,225
Bucky, come on.
Just please go away.

676
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:38,687
No, please. Don't make me
go back out there again, man.

677
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:42,274
It's fucking freaky
out there, man, please.

678
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,340
Get around the bus.

679
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:26,814
Jacky! Get us around this bus now.
Now!

680
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,400
Get around the bus!

681
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,194
Jacky, get out!
Get out of there, now!

682
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,583
Jacky?

683
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,920
You all right?

684
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,799
Jacky, answer me!

685
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:40,512
Jacky, answer me! Are you okay?

686
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,681
<i>I</i> think so.

687
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,157
Jacky, get us away from the bus!

688
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,995
Come on, go!
Get us away from the bus!

689
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:09,208
<i>Get gem', Jacky, get gem'.
Get us away.</i>

690
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:11,752
Move it!

691
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,595
Dad!

692
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,307
Dad?

693
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:26,475
Yeah?

694
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,027
Dad!

695
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,627
All you kids, get down.

696
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:11,955
Jacky! Jacky!

697
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:15,375
You try to get us away
from the bus! Now!

698
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,341
Come on!

699
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:42,736
Dad!

700
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:48,200
Dad, get out of there!

701
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,702
The spool's jammed
in the cradle!

702
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,162
Dad, just get out!

703
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:55,082
The cradle's welded
to the truck's frame.

704
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:58,460
Get out, Dad. No, he'll rip my
gun right out of the truck!

705
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:01,088
Dad, just get the
fuck out of there!

706
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:32,619
Dad! Dad!

707
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,121
Are you okay?

708
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,625
Dad!

709
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,674
Dad?

710
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,385
Dad!

711
01:21:03,483 --> 01:21:07,779
You're not gonna believe this. But
I think I found a way out of here.

712
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,744
What?

713
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:14,929
Minxie said it doesn't matter.

714
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,414
It doesn't matter
what Minxie said.

715
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:20,792
Right?

716
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:25,797
The others might've gotten away.

717
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,507
We don't know that.

718
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:30,010
Kimball, too.

719
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:36,892
Hey, nobody gets
to decide we die.

720
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:39,561
No dream, nobody. Nobody
gets to decide that.

721
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:41,313
That is bullshit!

722
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:49,279
I hope so.

723
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,743
Come on, I wanna go show
you a big ugly bug.

724
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:01,851
That's the truck
that passed us this morning.

725
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,436
Remember, with the
big bug on top of it?

726
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,896
You think we can just
drive away in it?

727
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,005
No, but I think I know
how to hot-wire a truck.

728
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,382
That's how I
got in my bar fight.

729
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:09,692
I was tryin' to steal
somebody's truck.

730
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:10,716
A gay bar?

731
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,428
Jesus Christ!

732
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:21,645
Wherever he was goin',
I don't think he made it.

733
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,277
Oh, my God, the keys are in it!

734
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,780
Come on, man,
the keys are in it.

735
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,036
It's not birds.

736
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,124
Fuck! Shit!

737
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,756
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

738
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,299
Come on.

739
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:53,760
Go, man! Go!

740
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,064
I'm a sitting duck back
here, Izzy, step on it!

741
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,607
I've got it floored!

742
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,569
Go! Come on, go faster!
Make it go faster!

743
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:11,945
I can't!

744
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:17,576
Go! Go! Go, man!

745
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:20,245
Go! Go! Izzy, go!

746
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:25,083
Go! Izzy, move
this piece of shit!

747
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:28,503
Come on! Come on! Move it!

748
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:31,131
Izzy! Go! Go!

749
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:44,394
Izzy, do something!

750
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:48,899
Izzy!

751
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:50,776
Get down!

752
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,530
Izzy!

753
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:59,534
Come on! Come on! Izzy!

754
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:02,996
Do something,
fucking do something!

755
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:06,416
- Get out!
- What?

756
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,294
Come on! Come on! Come on!

757
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:10,462
Get out.

758
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,339
Are you fuckin' crazy?

759
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:17,260
Izzy! Izzy! Come on! Izzy!

760
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:18,678
Stay down!

761
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,973
Stay down!

762
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:35,508
It isn't dead.

763
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:42,515
Its time ran out.

764
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:02,785
It looks dead to me.

765
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:29,539
You Taggart?

766
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:31,082
That's right.

767
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:34,502
Can we see it?

768
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:36,087
Can you read?

769
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:47,098
Is this something real? I heard
it was a bunch of bullshit.

770
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,476
Still five bucks.

771
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,314
Where'd it come from?

772
01:34:57,483 --> 01:34:59,068
My dad killed it.

773
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:01,446
Yeah, but where'd it come from?

774
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:05,032
It's five bucks from you, too.

775
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,579
How'd he kill it?

776
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,959
Ask him.

777
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:53,998
Come on, man. We ought to
go get our money back.

778
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,878
BOY 12 What the hell is it?

779
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:01,214
What do you think it is?

780
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,849
We don't touch it.

781
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:25,738
What's the story on this thing?

782
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:29,200
Whatever you've
heard. Probably.

783
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:33,162
You expect us to think
that, that thing's real?

784
01:36:33,246 --> 01:36:34,914
Don't really care.

785
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:37,083
How'd you kill it?

786
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:41,796
Stabbed it right
through the heart

787
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:46,801
with a big homemade harpoon.

788
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:56,352
When?

789
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,647
About 23 years ago.

790
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,611
You waitin' for somethin'?

791
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,576
About three more days,

792
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,748
give or take a day or two.
