1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,074


2
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:00,592
Billy?
Get number three up now.

3
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,600
And don't come in to eat
before you do.

4
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,900
And check the other two!

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,700
Make sure they're wired up good!

6
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,700
I don't want 'em blowing over
again at the first big wind.

7
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,000
Lot of good they're doing.

8
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,910
Billy, you been messing
with the post-puncher?

9
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:55,348
No!

10
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:57,419
I told you what would happen...

11
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:58,949
if you screw around
with this thing.

12
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,760
I said I didn't!

13
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,100
"l don't want 'em
blowin' down again."

14
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Big wind, my ass.

15
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,900
You're the only big wind
out here.

16
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,700
Jacky!

17
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,500
You been messing with the damn
post-puncher again, huh?

18
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
No.

19
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,500
Billy, you little asshole!

20
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,200
Why don't you rat yourself out
for a change?

21
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,900
-What did I do?
-You little butt sniff!

22
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,800
I ought to come out there
and kick your ass!

23
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
You wish!

24
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, go on, Mac. Go bite him
in the ass for me, Mackie boy.

25
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,700
God, would you shut up?

26
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
Jacky!

27
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,900
Jacky!

28
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,500
Jacky!

29
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
Jacky!

30
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,000
-What?
-I don't know.

31
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:13,412
What?

32
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Help!

33
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,800
Billy!

34
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,100
Help! Help!

35
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,000
Where are you? Billy!

36
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,000
Daddy!

37
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,700
Billy!

38
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,300
Let go! Help me, dad!

39
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,100
-Billy!
-Help! Help! Help!

40
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,300
-Billy!
-Help! Dad! Help me!

41
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,400
Billy!

42
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
Stop it! Let go!

43
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,200
-Billy!
-Daddy!

44
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,300
Billy!

45
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,800
Help!

46
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,500
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!

47
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,800
-Go!
-Louder!

48
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,100
-Go!
-Louder!

49
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,400
Go Bantams! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

50
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,800
Tough as nails, hard as rocks!

51
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,100
We are Bannon's fighting cocks!

52
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,400
Fighting Bantams,
tough as nails!

53
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,500
Bow down now or kiss our tails!

54
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,800
Out for blood,
we're lean and mean!

55
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Bannon County's death machine!

56
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,100
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!

57
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,400
Go Bantams!

58
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Bannon Bantams, power and might!

59
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Bannon Bantams,
fight, fight, fight!

60
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Incoming!

61
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,100
Bannon Bantams, we're the word!

62
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,300
You don't mess
with a mighty bird!

63
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,400
Down the court
we'll clean your clock!

64
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,800
Better not mess
with the fighting cock!

65
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams!

66
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,700
Go Bantams!

67
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,000
Bannon Bantams, wings of steel!

68
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,100
Bannon Bantams,
kill, kill, kill!

69
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,200
Who was that? Don't even ask!

70
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
Big bad Bantams kick your ass!

71
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,700
Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams!

72
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,800
Go Bantams!

73
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Go!

74
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Go Bantams!

75
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,100
We are the champs!
We are the champs!

76
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,200
Tough as nails, hard as rocks!
We are Bannon's fighting cocks!

77
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
How long can they keep this up?

78
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
Forever. They have a fight song
with the word "cock" in it.

79
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,400
Why aren't you sitting
with your honey?

80
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,500
Bannon County's death machine!

81
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,800
Someone should tell him he just
won the state championship.

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,200
I have a feeling
he didn't get to play enough.

83
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,100
Well, shouldn't you be
sitting with him?

84
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,600
After a game, he says
he needs to be with the guys.

85
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,900
You'd kill
his post-game bus high.

86
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Basically. If they lose,
it's a totally different thing.

87
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
Can't pry him off me.

88
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,600
Shit.

89
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,000
OK, everybody sit down.
Sit tight.

90
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Son of a bitch!

91
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,000
What in the hell
would you call that?

92
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,700
I don't know,
but whatever it is...

93
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,500
it's sharp as a son of a bitch.

94
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,200
What in the hell
are we looking at?

95
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,800
Sharp enough to flatten a tire,
whatever it is.

96
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,400
You know how thick
that rubber is?

97
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,000
Have to be shot into it
like a bullet.

98
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,700
Jesus Christ! The damn thing
has got teeth in it!

99
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,600
They can't just whip the jack
out and pump this mother up?

100
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,900
The driver can't change a flat
on a bus.

101
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,000
-They need a mechanic.
-So?

102
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,000
So, do you see
any mechanics around here?

103
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,500
You sucked so bad today,
Deaundre...

104
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,100
they're probably saying
you gotta change the flat.

105
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
...where she'll
give us the latest update...

106
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,800
-lzzy!
-on a continuing story...

107
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,800
we call
"The Horror in Poho County."

108
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,700
Hey, Poho update!

109
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,400
Well, Peter,
the fire which gutted...

110
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
an old church south
of Pertwilla four days ago...

111
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,700
continues to offer up
a gruesome bounty.

112
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,200
County sheriffs
excavating the charred ruins...

113
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,700
say the body count is now up
well past three hundred.

114
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,300
County coroners
say the bodies were found...

115
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,600
stitched to each other...

116
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,400
covering the basement's
walls and ceiling.

117
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,500
One on-the-scene witness
called it...

118
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,800
"a human tapestry
of torture and sadism"...

119
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,600
and "a sight
he will never forget."

120
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
Sheila,
the details keep getting...

121
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,900
stranger and stranger
every day this week, it seems.

122
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Any new information?

123
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,000
Some of the corpses
they have found...

124
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,200
had false teeth
made out of wood.

125
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,600
That means some of the bodies
they're finding down there...

126
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,900
are over two hundred years old.

127
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,300
But, Peter, it's
the condition of the cadavers...

128
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
that's
the strangest fact of all.

129
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,000
The county coroner's office
reported yesterday...

130
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,100
that they have yet to find
any one complete body.

131
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,600
-Believe that, man?
-No, they're making it up.

132
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
...missing an external limb
or an internal organ.

133
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,300
What connection this has--

134
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,700
This is 226, out on east 9.

135
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,600
We are down and disabled.
Home base, do you read me?

136
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,300
You get a good look
at the points on this thing?

137
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,200
It's either ivory
or some kind of bone.

138
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,900
Throw that damn thing away
before you need a tetanus shot.

139
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,400
This is Betty Gorman out on 226.

140
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,900
We are down and disabled
out on east 9.

141
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
Pop!

142
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,700
Pop, it dropped something!

143
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,100
Pop?

144
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,700
It was out in the corn, papa.

145
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,300
Here, look at it.

146
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,600
We are out on east 9. We are
down and disabled. Come back.

147
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
-What about Kimball, man?
-Say again.

148
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,500
This is 226. Anyone read me?

149
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,000
We are down and disabled
out on east 9. Come back.

150
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,900
We gotta be in some kind of
sun spot or something.

151
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,500
There's no signal getting out.

152
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,000
It's going to be dark
in about an hour.

153
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Well, we still got five tires
on the ground which means...

154
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,400
we can probably limp home
if we keep the going slow.

155
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,600
Say again, this is 226.
Anyone read me?

156
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,200
All of you at the same time?

157
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,000
Lady cheerleaders!

158
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
That's not smoke I smell,
is it?

159
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,300
Minxie...

160
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
there's not a girl
in the world these days...

161
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,500
stupid enough
to kill themselves...

162
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,900
by sucking on cancer sticks,
am I right?

163
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,900
Back on the bus, ladies.

164
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,800
You saw me, right?

165
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Run that fast break? Huh?
You see that?

166
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,800
-Yeah, I saw it.
-Anybody gonna read about it?

167
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,400
Why do you give ol' Dante
back there so much ink, huh?

168
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,500
I'm serious.

169
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,100
People are starting to think
that you're sweet on him.

170
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,100
Really? I heard that was you.

171
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
Hey, it's OK if you are, man.

172
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
I mean,
live and let love, right?

173
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,600
Why don't you piss
on somebody else's shoes, Jake?

174
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
Shouldn't you be
folding towels somewhere...

175
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
or sniffing jockstraps?

176
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,900
You think you can manage
the team, super genius?

177
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,300
Was I even talking to you,
jockstrap boy?

178
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,100
Hey, eat shit, Jake! God!

179
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,000
So this is all because, what,
I don't write enough about you?

180
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,800
You know what the story is
on your scars there, right?

181
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No, tell me.

182
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,500
Got into a fight
when you snuck into a bar.

183
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,600
So?

184
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,100
A gay bar, bro.

185
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,800
You do know what they call you,
don't you, lzzy?

186
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,600
That's my name.

187
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,500
"Or isn't he?"

188
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,700
Hey, let's not make this...

189
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,300
a social event out there,
everybody.

190
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Back on the bus, gentlemen.
We're moving!

191
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,900
Big K,
does that come in a man size?

192
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,500
That means you, too, Kimball!
Let's go!

193
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,500
Smooth move, Big K! Nice, man!

194
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,100
Tippi Hedren, man!

195
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Kimball!
Stop clowning around...

196
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
and get your ass
back on the bus!

197
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Off the top, gentlemen.

198
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,000
Assholes and elbows. Let's go.

199
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,300
Damn!

200
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,600
You know,
you could talk about it.

201
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,400
It might help a little bit.

202
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,000
What did I play today,
twelve minutes?

203
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,300
Well, it was
a great twelve minutes.

204
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,300
Hanna's got it in for me--

205
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,200
him and his little
token white boy Barnes.

206
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
I don't know...

207
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,800
maybe I got the wrong skin color
to get equal play on this team.

208
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,100
I know you don't mean that.

209
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
Maybe they just wanted
to make sure...

210
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,900
everyone got a chance to play
in the championship.

211
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,000
Everyone's not the reason why
we made it to the championship.

212
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,800
Half the losers on this bus
had nothing to do with...

213
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
us making it to state--I did.

214
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,400
What the fuck
are you looking at?

215
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, Jesus Christ!

216
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,700
Aw, don'ttell me.

217
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,300
-We blew the other one.
-How?

218
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Back down, everybody. Sit tight.

219
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,300
Shit. We better
break out the flares...

220
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,100
and get these kids off the bus.

221
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,200
Hey, hey, hey!

222
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,200
You want to sit in here
and hope somebody doesn't...

223
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,600
come along, plowing into us
doing ninety, huh?

224
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,200
All right, Duane...

225
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,500
you clear the bus,
I'll set the flares.

226
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
What is that, a flare gun?

227
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,900
You plan on being lost at sea
in this thing?

228
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
You making fun of my lockbox?

229
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
'Cause everything
in this thing...

230
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,000
has saved my sweet ass
at least once.

231
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,900
Oh, I don't believe it.

232
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
All right, bring your coats
and stay in a group.

233
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,500
This is Betty Borman,
out on 226.

234
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,000
We're broke down on east 9...

235
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,500
middle of Kissel County.
Anyone read me?

236
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,900
Want me to help you push it
off the road before I go?

237
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,400
I don't think we can move it.
It's on a bare rim in the back.

238
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
If you'd let the highway patrol
know, we'd appreciate it.

239
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,900
Sure.

240
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,500
Come on, guys.

241
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,500
Come on, let's go. Off the road.

242
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,100
Come on, guys.

243
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,300
Everyone on the shoulder.
Everyone stays in a group.

244
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,400
Over by the side of the fence.

245
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,700
Scott, come on!

246
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,600
Everyone stays back
and off the road! Now!

247
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,600
Stuck in the side
of the tire again.

248
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,600
Oh, God. Don't tell me...

249
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,000
that's a belly button
in the middle of that thing.

250
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Minxie, stay off the road.

251
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,700
Everybody, off the road!

252
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,300
Get everyone back on the bus.

253
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
-You just said they shouldn't--
-I know what I just said...

254
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,600
but there's something going on
out here, and I don't like it.

255
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,700
I think if we just st--

256
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
Coach?

257
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,400
What the f...

258
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Where the hell's the coach?

259
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Charlie?

260
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,700
Charlie!

261
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,000
Get everyone back inside
and close the doors.

262
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,800
OK, champions,
getting back on the Betty Boop.

263
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,300
Bucky, get on the two-way,
see if you can raise anyone.

264
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,300
-I'm talking to you, Scotty!
-What happened to the coach?

265
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,600
Get everyone back onboard
and close those doors.

266
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,300
Do it, Scotty.

267
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
All right, you heard him.

268
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,100
Assholes and elbows.
Everybody back on the bus.

269
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,500
Charlie?

270
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,400
Charlie?

271
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,900
Hurry up!
On the bus! Now, now, now!

272
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
I repeat, bus number 226...

273
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,600
Charlie!

274
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,600
We have an emergency situation
out here.

275
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,000
Does anybody read me?

276
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,700
This is bus number 226.
We are broke down on east 9.

277
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,900
Jake...

278
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
What happened?

279
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
-What did you see?
-What did you see?

280
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,600
Come on!
Did you see something or not?

281
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,200
She flew away.

282
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,300
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

283
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,400
-What I just said!
-People don't fly away!

284
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,600
Sit down, Scott!

285
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,900
What the hell's going on
out there?

286
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I said sit the fuck down
and shut up, god damn it! Now!

287
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,200
You, too, Jake. Everybody.

288
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,200
Go sit down, Scott.

289
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,800
-You got a problem with me?
-No. You got one with me?

290
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
-Do I what?
-You heard me.

291
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,500
We don't have time for bullshit,
Scotty. Go sit down!

292
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,500
Oh, God!

293
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What the hell?

294
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,800
Scotty!

295
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,200
What the fuck?

296
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Get the fucking doors!
Get the fucking doors!

297
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Get the fucking doors!

298
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,500
What was it?

299
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,700
Scotty, what the fuck was it?

300
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,100
-Scotty, come on!
-Scotty, we just want to know.

301
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I don't know what it was,
all right?

302
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,100
It had wings--

303
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
big fucking wings.

304
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,500
Central, this is unit 17.

305
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,700
We did a drive-by
in the general area.

306
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,500
Also found no evidence
of forced entry. Over.

307
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,000
0-3-2,
we're 10-7 at Opper's Diner...

308
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,600
for a little coffee and pie.
Copy that, central?

309
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,900
This is central.
Copy that, 0-3-6.

310
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,100
All units,
anybody else getting...

311
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,700
some weird stuff
out Kissel County way?

312
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,500
I just got two calls,
ten miles apart...

313
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,600
both reporting abductions.

314
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,000
All units,
be informed this should be...

315
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,400
strictly 10-36 information.

316
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,200
Someone burning a marijuana
field out there tonight?

317
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,000
'Cause these two stories
are way, way out.

318
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,000
Roger that, 3-6. Come back.

319
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
Jacky! Kissel County!

320
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,800
If you ask me,
this is Poho related.

321
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,400
Repeat--Poho related.

322
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,200
You all know
what I'm talking about.

323
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,900
This is Andy Buck.
Can anybody hear me?

324
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,400
Nobody's phone works.
Nobody's fucking phone works.

325
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,300
We are stuck
in a broken-down school bus...

326
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,500
out on east 9,
and we are in serious trouble.

327
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,700
Do you read me?

328
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,000
Fuck! Come on!
Is anybody even out there?

329
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
This is Andy Buck!

330
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,400
We're stuck in a broken-down
school bus out on east 9!

331
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,800
Javelins?

332
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,000
We've got spears on this bus?

333
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Sticks.

334
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,000
You want to wait around...

335
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,800
so you can poke at that thing
with sticks?

336
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,100
That thing
shows up here again...

337
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,500
I'd rather have a sharp stick
in my hand than nothing at all.

338
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,900
Hey, guys! Betty's flare gun.

339
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
Abunch offlaresforit,too!

340
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,900
Who says we wait around?
I'm serious.

341
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,600
Scotty, you're not talking
about getting off this bus.

342
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,700
You see that?

343
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
That means
that there's a farm...

344
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,000
down at the end of this road
somewhere...

345
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,300
and that's as far as
anybody'd have to get to.

346
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,100
With that thing out there?

347
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,800
Scotty,
with that thing out there?

348
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,800
Scotty!

349
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,600
That thing hasn't been
back here in almost an hour.

350
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
That doesn't mean it's not
still up there somewhere.

351
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,100
And that doesn't mean
that it is.

352
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
Hey, this isn't about
who can run the fastest, OK?

353
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,700
-Or being a pussy.
-What is your problem?

354
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,700
-You tell me, lzzy or isn't he?
-Check yourselves, both of you!

355
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Do I make you nervous?

356
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Thinking you're going
to come onto me...

357
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
and every other swinging dick
on this bus makes me nervous.

358
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,200
Yeah, it makes you
fucking stupid, too!

359
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,600
Scotty, stop it!

360
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,200
Stop it!

361
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,700
Scotty, come on.

362
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,100
You get that hand off of me...

363
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,800
or we're gonna have one more
missing person out here.

364
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
There's nothing about
any of us on this bus...

365
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,600
that's more important
than sticking together.

366
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
It's the only way
we're going to get through this.

367
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,900
You want to play
cock of the walk now, huh?

368
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,400
Now's not the time
for this shit, Scotty.

369
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,000
-Big K, sit.
-I'm serious.

370
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
You want to play
cock of the walk, bro?

371
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,000
Why do I think you want
to call me something else?

372
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,600
You want to call me
something else, Scotty?

373
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,900
'Cause I don't think you get...

374
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,800
I can see you thinking it
whether you say it or not.

375
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Just stop it right now.
Both of you, stop it!

376
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,900
You guys all worked together
today to win a ball game.

377
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Now that something
really serious happens...

378
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,100
you can't even be civil
to each other?

379
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,600
You tell him, not me.

380
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,500
Whatever your trip is,
we ain't got time for this shit.

381
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
We should all be
looking for ways...

382
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,200
we can defend ourselves
until help gets here.

383
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,400
We have got to move
this piece of shit!

384
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
On what, the rim?

385
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Can you drive this thing or not?

386
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,300
We wouldn't get two feet, man!
What do you want me to do?

387
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,500
What the hell does it want?

388
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,700
What the fuck?
Is it looking at me?

389
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,500
Whatever it is,
it's a smell freak, man.

390
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,300
Get that light off him.

391
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,100
Hey, don't shoot
that thing in here, man!

392
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,700
He's right. It'll fill this
place up like a smokebomb.

393
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,000
Holy shit!

394
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,500
Did that just come off the door?

395
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Bucky, get on those front doors
and get ready to open them.

396
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,600
What, you think
we're gonna run outside?

397
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,500
If he fucking comes inside.

398
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,100
Oh, shit!

399
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,500
Oh, my God!

400
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,400
Minxie?

401
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,500
Minxie?

402
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,400
Is she OK?

403
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,700
Minxie. Minxie.

404
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,100
Minxie?

405
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,500
Minxie?

406
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,000
He eats everything.

407
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,600
-He knows no mercy.
-No one is safe.

408
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,900
Every 23rd spring,
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

409
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,800
Eat what?

410
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,300
Eat what?

411
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,500
Eat us.

412
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,600
Minx?

413
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,800
Are you OK?

414
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,100
Look at me.

415
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,000
I thought you were gone, girl.
You passed out. Look at me.

416
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,000
Are you OK?

417
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,400
Your eyes went all the way
in the back of your head.

418
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,600
I think he's gone, man.
I'm willing to bet money on it.

419
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,200
You willing to bet
stepping off this bus?

420
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,400
Because that's the real bet.

421
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,800
How long's it been?

422
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's gone. It came,
it did its thing, it went away.

423
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,800
It went away,
but what the hell was it doing?

424
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,700
What do you think it was doing?

425
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,200
It was picking people out.

426
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,800
What?

427
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,100
It can smell something
in people, in their fear--

428
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,800
something that helps it
pick people out.

429
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,200
Pick people out for what?

430
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,100
I don't understand how
you would know that, sweetie.

431
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,100
A dead boy told me.

432
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,600
I think
he was trying to warn me.

433
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,200
He was trying to warn
all of us...

434
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,900
that this thing has been around
for thousands of years...

435
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,600
and that nothing
has been able to kill it.

436
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,300
This is a dream you had?

437
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,500
Well, the boy was dead,
so, yes...

438
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,000
I am assuming
that it was a dream, Scotty.

439
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,000
You were waving pom-poms
at people this morning.

440
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,400
Now all of a sudden
you're a psychic hotline?

441
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
I don't know!

442
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,600
You want to explain it to me?
Because I can't.

443
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,878
The boy was trying to warn us...

444
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:53,635
that by morning it has
to go back into the earth.

445
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,400
Oh, come on.

446
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,600
Into the ground
for twenty-three more years.

447
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,900
And then what?
Lives happily ever after? Huh?

448
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,000
Why don't you clean out
your bong, all right?

449
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,600
Scotty, just listen to her.

450
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,900
It is coming back.

451
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,300
This is a dream she had, Rhonda.
Are you going to believe it?

452
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,500
And it doesn't matter
if we're hiding on this bus...

453
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,100
or if we're hiding
under our beds.

454
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,100
It'll find us--

455
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
the ones that it picked out.

456
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Minx, take it easy, OK?

457
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,800
The boy told me that...

458
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,500
it can smell in our fear
who it wants...

459
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,400
and what from them...

460
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,700
it wants to eat.

461
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,200
Hello. Is anyone out there?

462
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,000
Hello. We have
a serious problem out here.

463
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,700
We need help right away.
Can anybody hear me?

464
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,400
Is anybody out there, please?

465
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,900
We have a--
This is Andy Buck.

466
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,500
We have a serious situation
out here.

467
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,500
Is anybody out there?

468
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,200
Does anybody hear me?

469
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,200
Dad!

470
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,300
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

471
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,800
-226, are you still there?
-I'm so fucking still here.

472
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,500
OK, OK. Just say again
what you just told me.

473
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,100
We're not playing games here,
right?

474
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,400
Just say it, man.

475
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,700
We are trapped in a broken-down
school bus out on east 9...

476
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,700
and something
is going to kill us...

477
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,700
if we don't get help
out here right away.

478
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,800
Where on 9 east?

479
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,800
In Kissel County.
Are you the cops?

480
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,900
What's trying to kill you?
What are you talking about?

481
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,200
Just tell me,
are you the fucking cops?

482
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,000
Look, now listen to me.
I'm already on the 9...

483
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,400
but it's a big highway
and so is Kissel County.

484
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,600
Are there any landmarks
near you?

485
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,000
Are you close to anything?

486
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,400
Yeah, I'm close to peeing
in my fucking pants, man.

487
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,700
Can you just please tell me
that you're on the way?

488
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,500
I can't really judge
the strength of your signal...

489
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,800
but it doesn't sound close.

490
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,400
What does that mean, man?

491
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,800
It means it's going to take me
a while to get to you.

492
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Look, we kind of have
a time-critical situation here.

493
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,400
Roger that.

494
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,400
And please tell me that
you're coming with backup...

495
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,100
because
if you're not the cops...

496
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,200
you got to promise me
that you'll call them...

497
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,300
and you'll tell them
that we're stuck out here.

498
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,000
I'll call them.
I'll call them right now...

499
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,900
but what you've got to do
is hang on.

500
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,100
Can you do that? Hang on.

501
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,600
Keep headed east.

502
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,100
Dad?

503
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,200
Just get us out there.

504
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,700
Do it.

505
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,200
Yes!

506
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,600
It's fucking happening, man!
It's fucking happening!

507
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,200
We're being fucking rescued!

508
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,100
Help me! Get this thing off me!

509
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,600
Help! Help! Get this thing off!

510
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,400
Help me! Get this thing off me!

511
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,900
Look out!

512
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,500
Half its fuckin' head's gone.

513
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,000
Fuck.

514
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,900
-You gotta be...
-Fucking kiddin' me.

515
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,500
Get that door open.
Now's our chance.

516
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,900
It's dead, right?

517
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,700
Don't know. Don't care.

518
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,300
It won't open!

519
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,800
Stop pushin' on 'em!
They open in!

520
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,400
Something got screwed up!

521
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,200
The door opens.

522
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,600
Maybe it only opens
from the outside.

523
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,000
It's an emergency exit, idiot.

524
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,200
Then you fuckin' open it, man!

525
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,200
Get that door open.

526
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,200
How can both fuckin' exits
not fuckin' work?

527
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,100
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

528
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,400
He jammed it.

529
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,500
We thought
it was trying to come in...

530
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,200
but this frickin' thing
was making sure...

531
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,100
we couldn't get out.

532
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,800
Break the fuckin' doors!

533
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,600
Holy shit, man.

534
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,800
Hey, we can
pry this thing open.

535
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,800
Give me a pole or a bar or
something metal--something big.

536
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,600
Yeah, yeah. That'll work.

537
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,000
Come on, D.
You need to get to this side.

538
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,800
Come on, everybody. Come on.

539
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,100
This thing's like
a fuckin' shower curtain, man.

540
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,500
It's crazy.

541
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,100
Oh, man,
show like you got a pair.

542
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,500
Man, fuck you.

543
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,500
Come on.

544
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,600
Everybody, let's go.

545
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,400
Shower curtain?

546
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,300
This thing's like
a fucking piece of toilet paper.

547
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,700
What's it doing, Minx?

548
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,400
What's it doing, Minx?

549
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,200
What's it doing up there?

550
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,100
It just tore its head off.

551
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,100
It's time to go.

552
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,400
What are you talking about,
man? Help is coming.

553
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,700
The 9 is big. Remember?

554
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,200
What if he's an hour away?

555
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,400
What's if he's going
in the wrong direction?

556
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,200
There are fucking cops
on the way, man.

557
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,500
And you want the rest of us...

558
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,100
to sit underneath
that big hole in the roof...

559
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,800
and hope that thing
doesn't come crashing in here?

560
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,200
What do you mean,
the rest of us?

561
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
I mean...

562
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,600
it's time to stop being polite.

563
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,300
There are two classes
of people on this bus now.

564
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,500
It had its pick
of twenty of us back there...

565
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,800
and it picked who?

566
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,100
Dante was one.

567
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,100
Another one was you, Jake.

568
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,900
Oh, god damn it, Scott.
Don't--

569
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,700
And we all saw him
go for you, Bucky.

570
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,900
What the hell
is that supposed to mean, huh?

571
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,000
Two classes of people?

572
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,900
What, the "will be eaten"
and the "won't be eaten"?

573
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,500
Fuck you, Scotty.

574
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,200
Minxie says this thing...

575
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,100
gets anybody it picks out,
no matter what.

576
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,000
Don't put me in this.

577
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,900
She also said
that after tonight...

578
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,400
it goes away,
and for a long time, Scott.

579
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,300
You tell us, Minxie.

580
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,100
Are we safe if we can hide out
till morning...

581
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,300
or is this thing
gonna come after these guys...

582
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,800
with everything it's got
'cause it only has till morning?

583
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,100
Huh?

584
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,300
We're screwed, right?

585
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,300
Yeah.

586
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,300
Scotty, you're not talkin'...

587
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,900
about throwing people
off this bus?

588
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,700
It's funny
you should say that, D...

589
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,900
'cause the only other one...

590
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,300
we know it picked out
for sure was you.

591
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,900
Whoa! Hold on a second!

592
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,900
We all saw the way
it sniffed you out back there.

593
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,100
You were the only one
it gave tongue action, man...

594
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,300
-and we all saw it.
-Scotty!

595
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,200
I don't understand
what you're trying to do.

596
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,600
I'm trying to stay alive.

597
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,100
You're trying to split us up!

598
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:50,700
We have just dropped a notch
on the fucking food chain, man.

599
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,500
This is about
living or dying now, OK?

600
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,900
And if this bus
is the only thing...

601
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,400
keeping that fucker
away for us...

602
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,900
how safe are we, you guys...

603
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,700
with everybody it's hungry for
sittin' inside it?

604
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,400
I want to see hands.

605
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,300
I want to see hands...

606
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,100
'cause as shitty a deal
as it is...

607
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:31,100
I gotta say I'd like you, Bucky,
and Jake off this bus, man.

608
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,400
You listen to me,
you piece of shit!

609
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:41,000
He looked at you, too, bro.

610
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,300
I saw him, and you did, too.

611
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,700
He looked right at you
and smiled.

612
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,500
And when you made Jake
take the lights off it...

613
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,300
he could've looked at you twice
and licked his fucking lips...

614
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,600
but we don't know that.

615
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,000
So you keep
your little blacklist.

616
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,700
'Cause when he takes you out--
and I hope he does--

617
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,600
I'm gonna be the one
gettin' as far away...

618
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,300
from your sorry ass as I can.

619
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,400
"Time to go" is right.

620
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,700
-I'm gonna go find that farm.
-Then I'm going with you.

621
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,400
You know I'm coming.

622
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,100
You want to keep this bus?

623
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,000
Then you sit in it.

624
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,000
Right under that big hole.

625
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,200
See how long you last.

626
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,300
Look, I'm sorry, D.

627
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,400
You are so right about that.

628
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,200
Come on, guys.

629
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,200
Come on, help is on the way.

630
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,900
Why are we splitting up?

631
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,400
He said he was coming.

632
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,500
We're gonna leave,
and he's gonna pull up.

633
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,700
That bus is a deathtrap, Bucky.
Use your head.

634
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,700
You're really gonna
let them go alone?

635
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,100
What, do you want
to go with them?

636
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,700
We don't know who it picked out.

637
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,900
Jesus Christ,
it looked at everyone.

638
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,200
Scotty, let go of me.

639
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,300
-Let go of you?
-Let go of me!

640
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,500
Fuck.

641
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,800
Rho...

642
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,600
tell me you're really
walking away from me.

643
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,700
You used me. You used all of us!

644
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,600
All you care about is yourself.

645
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,800
Rho...

646
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,200
You want to know, Scotty,
what I found out today?

647
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,800
When people get really scared...

648
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,700
it's just like
when they get drunk.

649
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,700
The real person
comes to the surface.

650
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,100
We could've protected
D and Jake and all of us...

651
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,500
if we'd stuck together!

652
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,500
You know, like in a team.

653
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700
Hey. Hey!

654
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,900
Jonny!

655
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,700
-Open the door!
-Open the door!

656
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,500
Open the door!

657
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,000
You little cocksucker!
I will fucking fry you!

658
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,100
You open these goddamn doors!
You open them right now!

659
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,600
Jonny, open the fucking doors,
man! Open the fucking doors

660
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,100
Open the--
This is my bus, too, man!

661
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,400
Run!

662
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,600
Run! He's right behind you, D!

663
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,800
Run! Run!

664
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,500
Get back! Get off! Break off!

665
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,400
Oh, God!

666
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,800
-Shit!
-Hold on, hold on!

667
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,900
Hold still!

668
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,900
Stop moving! Stop!

669
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,300
Come on, Scotty!

670
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,000
You're hurting him!
You're hurting him!

671
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,700
Get me--

672
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,800
-Hold still! Pull it out!
-Hold on!

673
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,900
Stop it! Keep back! Stop moving!

674
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,400
It's in there like it's welded!

675
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,500
Pull that out!
You're hurting him!

676
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,100
Stop it, Scotty!

677
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,500
-Hold still!
-Stop it, Scotty!

678
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,100
Izzy, hold him! Hold him!

679
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,200
Scotty, hold still!

680
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,600
Scotty, hold still!

681
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,600
Get it!

682
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,300
Please fuckin' hurry!

683
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,400
Oh, God!

684
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, shit! Please hurry!

685
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,400
Oh, God! Please hurry!

686
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,800
Oh, D, I'm sorry, man!
I'm so sorry!

687
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,700
Please fuckin' help!

688
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,000
Scotty! Scotty!

689
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,400
Scotty! Scotty!

690
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,000
Scotty! Scotty!

691
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:20,700
Damn it! Scotty! Scotty!

692
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,400
What is it, boy? What is it?

693
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,000
Papa!

694
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,500
Go. Go!

695
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,000
Where did you come from?

696
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,900
From that bus?

697
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,300
How far up ahead?

698
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,600
Huh?

699
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,800
Come on, answer me.

700
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,700
It doesn't matter.

701
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,100
There's no one on the bus,
and you can't kill it.

702
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:55,000
Jacky, get the dog inside.

703
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,600
Look, you can't stop it!

704
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,900
You get in the cabin
with Jack Jr.

705
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,900
You stay down till this is over.

706
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,900
This'll never be over!

707
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,500
It doesn't matter what you do.

708
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,300
It'll be back...

709
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,900
twenty-three years from now...

710
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,500
and twenty-three years
from then.

711
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,000
Get us to that bus.

712
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,400
Jonny?

713
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,900
Jonny?

714
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,000
What was that?

715
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,200
Jonny?

716
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,200
Bucky!

717
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,200
What are you doin' here?

718
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,300
What are you doin' here?

719
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,500
You let her in, huh, Jonny?

720
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,500
Have you seen anybody else?

721
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,800
What are you doing?

722
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,200
That thing is after you, Bucky.

723
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,700
Hey, there's no farm
out there, man.

724
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,600
I must--I must've run ten miles
all over this fuckin' valley.

725
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,600
Bucky...

726
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,300
come on, just please go away.

727
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,200
Don't make me
go back out there again, man.

728
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,500
It's fuckin' freaky
out there, man. Please.

729
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,200
Get around the bus!

730
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,800
Jacky!

731
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,400
Get us around this bus now!

732
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Now! Get around the bus!

733
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,000
Jacky, get out!
Get out of there now!

734
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,300
Jacky!

735
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,900
You all right?

736
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,100
Jacky, answer me!

737
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,500
Jacky, answer me!

738
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,000
Are you OK?

739
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,100
I think so.

740
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,400
Jacky, get us away
from the bus!

741
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:06,100
Come on, let's go!
Get us away from the bus!

742
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,100
Come on, Jacky, go on!
Get us away!

743
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,500
Move it!

744
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,900
Dad?

745
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,200
-Dad?
-Yeah!

746
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,500
Dad!

747
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,500
All you kids, get down!

748
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,100
Jacky!

749
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,800
Jacky!

750
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,600
You gotta get us
away from the bus now!

751
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,600
Come on!

752
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,800
Dad!

753
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,400
Dad, get out of there.

754
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,000
The spool's jammed
in the cradle!

755
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,500
Dad, just get out!

756
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,900
The cradle's welded
to the truck's frame.

757
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,200
Get out, dad!

758
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,700
He'll rip my gun
right out of the truck!

759
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,500
Dad, just get the fuck
out of there!

760
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,100
Dad, dad...

761
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,400
are you OK?

762
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,900
Dad!

763
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,300
Dad?

764
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:49,900
Dad!

765
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,600
You're not going
to believe this...

766
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,300
but I think
I found a way out of here.

767
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,500
What?

768
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,400
Minxie said it doesn't matter.

769
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,300
It doesn't matter
what Minxie said.

770
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,600
Right?

771
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,800
The others might've gotten away.

772
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,400
We don't know that.

773
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,000
Kimball, too.

774
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,900
Hey, nobody gets to decide
we die.

775
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,700
No dream, nobody--
nobody gets to decide that!

776
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,200
That is bullshit!

777
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,400
I hope so.

778
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,800
Come on, I want to go show you
a big ugly bug.

779
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,000
That's the truck
that passed us this morning--

780
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,600
you remember,
with the big bug on top of it?

781
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,000
You think we can just
drive away in it?

782
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,000
No, but I think I know
how to hot-wire a truck.

783
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,100
That's how I got
in my bar fight.

784
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,800
I was trying to steal
somebody's truck.

785
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,800
A gay bar?

786
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,800
Jesus Christ.

787
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,800
Wherever he was going,
I don't think he made it.

788
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,300
Oh, my God.
The keys are in it.

789
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,400
Come on, man,
the keys are in it.

790
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,300
It's not birds.

791
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,100
-Come on.
-Fuck!

792
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,400
Shit!

793
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,600
D!

794
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,200
Go! Go, go!

795
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:53,300
Go, go, go! Go, go!

796
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,700
Go, man, go!

797
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,100
I'm a sitting duck
back here, lzzy! Step on it!

798
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,000
I've got it floored!

799
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,100
Go! Come on, go!

800
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,500
-Go faster! Make it go faster!
-I can't!

801
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,500
Go, go!

802
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,900
Go, man! Go, go!

803
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,200
Izzy, go!

804
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,000
Go! Izzy!
Move this piece of shit!

805
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,600
Come on! Come on! Move it!

806
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,800
Izzy! Go, go!

807
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,300
Izzy, do something!

808
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,400
Izzy!

809
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,900
Get down!

810
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,600
Izzy!

811
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,300
Come on! Come on!

812
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,700
Izzy!

813
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:04,300
Izzy, fucking do something!

814
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,600
-Get out!
-What?

815
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,700
Come on! Come on! Come on!

816
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,600
-Get out!
-Are you fucking crazy?

817
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,600
Izzy! Izzy!

818
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,500
-Come on! Izzy!
-Stay down!

819
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,900
Stay down!

820
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,400
It isn't dead.

821
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,300
Its time ran out.

822
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,300
It looks dead to me.

823
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,700
You Taggart?

824
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,900
That's right.

825
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,500
Can we see it?

826
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,100
Can you read?

827
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,600
This something real?

828
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,600
Because I heard
it was a bunch of bullshit.

829
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,600
It's still five bucks.

830
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,200
Where'd it come from?

831
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,100
My dad killed it.

832
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:02,000
Yeah, but where'd it come from?

833
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,700
It's five bucks from you, too.

834
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,700
How'd he kill it?

835
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,300
Ask him.

836
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Come on, man.

837
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,900
We ought to go get
our money back.

838
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,700
What the hell is it?

839
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,300
What do you think it is?

840
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,000
We don't touch it.

841
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,500
What's the story on this thing?

842
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,700
Whatever you've heard, probably.

843
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:34,100
You expect us to think
that that thing's real?

844
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:35,700
Don't really care.

845
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,700
How'd you kill it?

846
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:44,600
Stabbed it
right through the heart...

847
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:48,200
with a big homemade harpoon.

848
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,000
When?

849
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,800
About twenty-three years ago.

850
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,100
You waiting for something?

851
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,200
About three more days...

852
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,300
give or take a day or two.
