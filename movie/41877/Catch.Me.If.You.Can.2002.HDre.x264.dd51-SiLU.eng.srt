JOE GARAGIOLA:
Thank you very much

3
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:04,885
and welcome
to To Tell the Truth.

4
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,671
Our first guest,
he's made a career

5
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:08,743
out of being
the most outrageous impostor

6
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,763
that we've ever come across
on this show

7
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:12,643
and you're going to see
what I mean.

8
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:14,873
ANNOUNCER:
Number One

9
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,493
what is your name, please?

10
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,281
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

11
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,579
Number Two?

12
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,850
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

13
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:23,148
Number Three?

14
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:25,254
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

15
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,783
GARAGIOLA:
"From 1964 to 1967

16
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:29,407
"I successfully impersonated

17
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:32,004
"an airline pilot
for Pan Am Airways

18
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,155
"and I flew over
two million miles for free.

19
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:38,527
"During that time, I was also
the chief resident pediatrician

20
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:39,809
"at a Georgia hospital

21
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,688
"and an assistant
attorney general

22
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,125
"for the State of Louisiana.

23
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:45,360
"By the time I was caught,
I was considered

24
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,284
"the youngest and most daring
con man in U.S. history.

25
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,825
"I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks

26
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:55,567
"in 26 foreign countries
and all 50 states.

27
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:58,846
"And I did it all
before my 19th birthday.

28
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,858
My name is
Frank William Abagnale."

29
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,713
~ You don't know how
to tell the truth... ~

30
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:04,778
( applause )

31
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,602
~ You don't know how
to tell the truth... ~

32
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:07,643
So, for the first time

33
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,191
he's going to have
to tell the truth

34
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,046
and we're going to start
our questioning with Kitty.

35
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,158
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent--

36
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:16,466
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow--

37
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:19,090
why didn't you go in
for a legitimate profession?

38
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:21,564
It was really a question
of dollars and cents.

39
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,830
When I was a young man,
I needed the money

40
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:24,994
and I thought
this list of careers

41
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:26,329
was the easiest way to get it.

42
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,373
I see.

43
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:30,059
Number Two, I find this all
very fascinating.

44
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:31,941
Who was it
that finally caught you?

45
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,124
His name was Carl Hanratty.

46
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:37,102
( French accent ):
Han-an-an-ratty.

47
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:38,236
Ratty.

48
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:39,636
( American accent ):

49
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:40,642
Han-ratty.

50
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,876
Carl Hanratty.

51
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,243
-Yes.
-I...

52
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:46,734
am... Carl Hanratty.

53
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:51,057
I represent the FBI from
the United States of America.

54
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,575
( speaking French )

55
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,332
Yeah. I have orders

56
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:57,225
to see the American
prisoner, Abagnale.

57
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,953
( man translating
English into French )

58
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,251
( men speaking French )

59

( thunder rumbling outside )

64
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,721
You sit here.

65
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:29,476
You do not open the door.

66
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:33,041
You do not pass him...

67
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:36,356
anything through the hole.

68
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:39,700
( wind quietly blowing
through building )

Aw... Jesus.

( retching )

79
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,645
You know, I've got
a little bit of a cold myself.

80
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:11,399
-Frank...
-( coughing )

81
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,473
I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

82
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,937
according to the
European Court for Human Rights.

hear me, don't worry.

Washing off the lice.

116

This man has to be on a plane
for America.

117
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:23,631
He has to see a doctor.

118

The doctor comes in tomorrow.

119

I have worked too long, too hard

120
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,338
for you to take this
away from me.

has a history
that goes back to 1919.

In all those years

140
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,674
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

141
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:44,464
inducted as lifetime members.

142
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,413
It's an honor that, uh

143
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,082
that has seen 57 names enshrined
on the wall of honor

144
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:53,553
and tonight, we make it 58.

158
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,010
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife Paula...

159
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:51,118
...and my son, Frank Jr.--

160
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,097
Frank... Aw, stand up.
Come on--

161
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,555

( laughter )

163
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:08,377
Two little mice fell
in a bucket of cream.

The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

165
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:17,398
The second mouse...
wouldn't quit.

166
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:18,861
He struggled so hard

167
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:22,391
that eventually he churned
that cream into butter

168
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,277
and crawled out.

169
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:28,462
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

170
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:32,228
( laughter and enthusiastic
applause )

171
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:45,078
( "Embraceable You" playing
on record player )

172
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:47,702
PAULA:
You're a better dancer
than your father, Frankie.

173
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:49,258
You hear that, Daddy?

174
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,239
FRANK SR.:
Like fun.

175
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:51,367
PAULA:
The girls don't know

176
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,403
what they're in for.

177
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,368
Show him the dance
you were doing when we met.

178
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,760
Ah, who can remember?

179
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:59,196
The people
in that little French village

180
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:01,110
were so happy to see Americans

181
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,378
they decided
to put on a show for us.

182
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:05,362
So they crammed 200 soldiers...

183
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,309
Yeah, we know the story, Daddy.

184
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,155
...into that tiny social hall

185
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:11,391
and the first person
to walk onstage

186
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,918
is your mother,
and she starts to dance.

187
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:18,983
You know, it had been months
since we'd even seen a woman

188
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:20,803
and here's this blonde angel.

189
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:22,234
Blonde bombshell.

190
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:24,016
( giggles )

191
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:27,261
And the men are literally
holding their breath.

192
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:28,789
Holding their breath for you.

193
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,883
You hear that?

194
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:30,898
( giggles )

195
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:31,872
Mm-hmm.

196
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:34,040
And I turned to my buddies
and I said...

197
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:36,148
"I will not leave France
without her."

198
00:11:36,222 --> 00:11:37,449
And I didn't.

199
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,003
You didn't.

200
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:40,758
I didn't.

201
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,770
( liquid spills )

202
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,903
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, the rug!

203
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,916
Aw, Mom...

204
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:45,978
I can't believe I did that.

205
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,480
No, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

206
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:48,940
Oh, Frankie, Frankie,
get a towel.

207
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,946
-Yeah, yeah.
-Paula...

208
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:50,919
Come on.

209
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:54,649
~ My sweet embraceable you... ~

210
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:56,631
Dance with me, Paula.

211
00:11:58,742 --> 00:12:01,396
Ah... ( giggles )

212
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,142
( instrumental interlude
playing )

213
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,925
Whenever I dance for you

214
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,809
I get in trouble.

215
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:18,692
( mouthing ):
Watch this.

216
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,864
( chuckles )

217
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:23,492
Oh! ( laughs )

218
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:25,378
Frank! Wake up.

219
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:26,408
Come on, let's go!

220
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:28,266
Get up. Come on, come on.

221
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:29,762
Frank, wake up.

222
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,800
( groans ):
Dad...

223
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,100
You don't have to go
to school today.

224
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:34,164
It's okay.

225
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:35,335
Why? Is it snowing?

226
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:36,802
Do you have a black suit?

227
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,004
I overslept again, huh?

228
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:41,985
We have a very important
meeting in the city.

229
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,841
Eat that.
Come on, come on, eat.

230
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,394
Ma'am, open up.
Just open up, please!

231
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:46,407
-Ma'am?
-It's important.

232
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,503
What?

233
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:49,060
Oh, gosh!

234
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,395
We don't open
for half an hour!

235
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:52,213
Open the door, please.
Just open the door.

236
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:53,189
It's important.

237
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:55,104
I-I'm sorry, we don't open
for half an hour.

238
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:56,166
What's your name, ma'am?

239
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,337
Darcy.

240
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,438
Darcy. That's a pretty name.

241
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:01,455
I'm in a bit of a fix.
I need a suit for my kid.

242
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:02,592
This is my son Frank.

243
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,605
Oh, hi.

244
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:04,578
He needs a black suit.

245
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:05,586
Black suit...

246
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,625
There was a death in the family.

247
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,404
My father, 85 years old,
war hero.

248
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:09,382
Yeah?

249
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,938
There's a funeral
this afternoon, military funeral

250
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:14,535
planes flying overhead,
21-gun salute.

251
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:15,482
Geez.

252
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,271
Frank needs to borrow a suit
for a couple of hours.

253
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:21,226
I'm sorry, we don't loan suits,
and we're not open.

254
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,619
Darcy... Darcy, please.

255
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:24,468
-( sighs )
-Come back.

256
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,540
Darcy... is this yours?

257
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,296
( jingles )

258
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:34,719
I just found it
in the parking lot.

259
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:36,760
Uh-huh.

260
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:39,135
It must've slipped
right off your neck.

261
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:41,863
( tires screeching )

262
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:43,844
Don't hit the curb.

263
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:47,697
( brakes squeaking )

264
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,459
Now get out,
walk around the back

265
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,210
and hold the door open for me.

266
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:56,887
( car horn honks )

267
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,691
All right.

268
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:03,891
What's next?

269
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:05,258
Okay, stop grinning.

270
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:08,600
When I get inside, you go back
to the front seat and wait.

271
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,101
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket

272
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,080
you don't move the car,
understood?

273
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,992
Dad, wha-what's all this for?

274
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:17,030
You know why the Yankees
always win, Frank?

275
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:18,653
'Cause they have Mickey Mantle?

276
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,342
No, it's 'cause the other teams

277
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:22,683
can't stop staring
at those damn pinstripes.

278
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:23,690
Watch this.

279
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,537
The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

280
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,888
is about to open the door
for your father.

281
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:33,845
Mr. Abagnale, um

282
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,827
we don't usually
loan money to people

283
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,160
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

284
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,977
That's a misunderstanding.

285
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,628
I hired the wrong guy
to do my books.

286
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,349
A mistake, I...
anybody could make it.

287
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,655
I just need you guys
to help me weather the storm.

288
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:50,007
Sir, you're being investigated
by the government for tax fraud.

289
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:52,076
My store is a landmark
in New Rochelle.

290
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:53,931
I have customers
all over New York.

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,489
Well, you're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

292
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,557
We don't know you.

293
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,314
I'm sure your bank
in New Rochelle

294
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:00,845
they know you,
they could help you out.

295
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:02,394
My bank went out of business.

296
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,290
Banks like this one put
them out of business.

297
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:07,392
Now, I know I made a mistake,
I admit that

298
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:08,859
but these people want blood.

299
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:09,833
They want my store.

300
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,714
They've threatened
to put me in jail.

301
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:13,296
( stammers )

302
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:14,830
This is America, right?

303
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,870
I'm not a criminal.

304
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,394
I'm a Medal of Honor winner

305
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:20,115
a lifetime member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

306
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:23,008
All I'm asking is for you
to help me beat these guys.

307
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,497
It's not a question
of winning and losing.

308
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,966
It's a question of risk.

309
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:29,588
You're the largest bank
in the world.

310
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,176
Where's the fu...

311
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,773
Whe... Where's the risk?

312
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:41,731
Dad, how could you just let him
take our car like that?

313
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:43,711
He didn't take anything.
We took him.

314
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,838
He overpaid by $500.

315
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:48,022
Come on, Frank.

316
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,486
Let's return the suit.

317
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:51,466
( Paula sobbing )

318
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:58,540
This place is good.

319
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,453
It's small but, you know

320
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:02,953
it's going to be
a lot less work.

321
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:04,501
A lot less work for you.

322
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,264
( jackhammer drilling
in distance )

323
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,161
( keys clank )

324
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:28,356
FRANK:
Hey, Dad.

325
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,340
Hi.

326
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:35,695
Where's your mother?

327
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,308
I don't know.

328
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:41,365
She said something
about going to look for a job.

329
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,604
What's she gonna be

330
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:45,978
a shoe salesman
at a centipede farm?

331
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,008
( laughing )

332
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:49,541
( both laughing )

333
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,957
What are you doing?

334
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,450
( both laughing )

335
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:56,685
You want some pancakes?

336
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:57,661
For dinner?

337
00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:59,509
On my son's 16th birthday?

338
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,614
We're not gonna eat pancakes.

339
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,610
Come on, why are you looking
at me like that?

340
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:07,846
You thought I forgot?

341
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:10,805
-I didn't think you forgot.
-I opened a checking account

342
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:12,617
in your name.

343
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:14,756
I put $25 in the account

344
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,056
so you can buy
whatever you want.

345
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,034
Don't tell your mother.

346
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:18,096
I won't.

347
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,200
Thanks, Dad.

348
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:20,271
Yep.

349
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:23,255
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan, though?

350
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:24,912
Yes, they all turned me down.

351
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,313
( chuckles )

352
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:28,516
Then why you opening
a banking account with them?

353
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,689
Well, because one day,
you'll want something

354
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,542
from these people--
a house, a car.

355
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:35,499
They have all the money.

356
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,981
There's 50 checks there, Frank

357
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:45,452
which means, from this day on...

358
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,628
you're in their little club.

359
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:51,008
I'm in their little club.

360
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,078
You got that, you got it all.

361
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:57,366
It's even got my name there,
huh?

362
00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:58,662
To the moon.

363
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:03,567
-To the moon!
-To the moon.

364
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:05,546
( bells tolling )

365
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:14,468
See that? It's just a school.

366
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:16,184
No different than Westbourne.

367
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:19,918
Ma... you said you were
going to quit.

368
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,400
Frankie, you don't have
to wear the uniform here.

369
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,265
Why don't you take off
your jacket?

370
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,220
I'm used to it.

371
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:34,199
( indistinct conversation )

372
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:37,565
Excuse me.

373
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,546
Oh, yes?

374
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:40,361
Do you know
where room 17 French is?

375
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:42,079
GIRL:
Yeah, it's...

376
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:43,864
( snickering )

377
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:50,131
( school bell ringing )

378
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:52,011
BOY:
But you frickin' killed him.

379
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,442
( loud indistinct conversation )

380
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,522
You selling encyclopedias?

381
00:18:57,597 --> 00:19:00,959
Yeah, he looks like
a substitute teacher.

382
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:11,019
( boy laughing )

383
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:15,343
( loud conversation
and laughter continues )

384
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:17,413
Quiet down, people!

385
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,688
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

386
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,835
That's Abagnale, not Abagnahlee

387
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:26,181
not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale!

388
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,350
Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off

389
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:30,336
in your textbooks.

390
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,412
Excuse me, people,
if I need to ask again

391
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,033
I'm going to write up
the entire class.

392
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,374
Take your seats!

393
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,949
Chapter seven.

394
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:45,325
Will you please open your
textbooks to, uh, chapter eight

395
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:47,850
and we'll get started?

396
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,351
Excuse me,
what's your name?

397
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:50,446
Brad.

398
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:53,696
Brad, why don't you get up here
in front of the class here

399
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:56,807
and read conversation
number five?

400
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:02,163
( pronouncing poorly ):
"Les Francais sonts

401
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,115
"uh, generalement

402
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:06,868
-"dans leur pais que...
-( students laughing )

403
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,728
presque tout le monde
a cette impression... "

404
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:11,089
They sent for me.

405
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,235
They said they needed a sub
for Roberta.

406
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:16,994
I came all the way
from-from Dixon.

407
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:19,432
Well, uh,
I always sub for Roberta.

408
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:21,179
Excuse me,
why aren't you reading?

409
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:22,378
( continues reading )

410
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:27,119
I'll never come back to-to
Bellarmine Jefferson again!

411
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:29,002
-You tell them not to call me!
-( students laughing )

412
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,039
What do they think,
it's easy for a woman my age

413
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:33,283
and all the money that it costs
to travel?

414
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:34,548
I tell you,
they don't give a damn.

415
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,560
( students laughing )

416
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,653
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale

417
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:39,703
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

418
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:42,787
I regret to inform you that,
for the past week

419
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:46,357
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

420
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:48,923
He what?

421
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:52,911
Your son has been pretending
to be a substitute teacher

422
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:57,199
lecturing the students,
uh, giving out homework.

423
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:00,123
Mrs. Glasser has been ill
and there was

424
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:03,529
some confusion
with the real sub.

425
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,991
Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday

426
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,369
and was planning
a class field trip

427
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,870
to a French bread factory
in Trenton.

428
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:15,364
Do you see the problem we have?

429
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,354
-Mrs. Davenport?
-Yeah.

430
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,820
Uh, I have a note to miss fifth
and sixth period today.

431
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:20,792
Doctor's appointment.

432
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,342
-One moment.
-( phone ringing )

433
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,032
I'll be right with you.

434
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:25,010
( whispering ):
Hey...

435
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,016
MRS. DAVENPORT:
Yes?

436
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,179
You should fold it.

437
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:28,246
What?

438
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,870
That note. It's a fake, right?

439
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:31,204
You should fold it.

440
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,957
It's... It's a note from my mom.

441
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:34,643
I have a doctor's appointment.

442
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:37,470
Yeah, but there's no crease
in the paper.

443
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,475
When your mom hands you a note
to miss school

444
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:40,679
the first thing you do is,
you fold it

445
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:42,564
and you put it in your pocket.

446
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,674
I mean, if it's real,
where's the crease?

447
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,236
-( school bell ringing )
-( door opens )

448
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:56,452
( quietly ):
Frankie.

449
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:10,144
( both chuckling quietly )

450
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,555
Ma, I'm home.

451
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,568
( romantic music
plays on record player )

452
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,547
Oh, you remember
that girl Joanna

453
00:22:17,614 --> 00:22:19,649
I was telling you about?

454
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,664
I asked her out today.

455
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,975
Think we're going to go
to the Junior Prom.

456
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:26,925
( record scratches,
music stops )

457
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,705
Ma, is this
my driver's license?

458
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:30,457
That's all there is,
two bedrooms.

459
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,828
Oh, Frankie.

460
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:34,744
You remember Dad's friend?

461
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,624
Jack Barnes?

462
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:37,887
From the club.

463
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:38,865
Hello.

464
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,812
He came by looking
for your father.

465
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,501
I was giving him
a tour of the apartment.

466
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:46,482
It's very, uh, uh,
spacious, Paula.

467
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:54,113
Dad's at the store.

468
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:57,071
So, Frank...
you're getting to look

469
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:59,891
more like your old man
every day.

470
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:04,791
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

471
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,508
I'll see you later, eh?

472
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:08,491
Wait.

473
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:14,617
Is this yours?

474
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:17,280
Oh.

475
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:18,935
Well, thanks, Frank.

476
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,174
Uh, that's the President's pin.

477
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,613
I'd be in deep trouble
if I lost that.

478
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:27,508
( nervous chuckle )

479
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:31,556
I'll see you all later, eh?

480
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,880
Are you hungry, Frankie?

481
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:45,287
I'll make you a sandwich.

482
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:56,282
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

483
00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:00,183
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.

484
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,531
That is not legal,
what they're doing to us.

485
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:09,496
Why aren't you saying anything?

486
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:20,196
You're not going to tell him...
are you?

487
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,920
( quietly ):
No.

488
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:23,185
That's right.

489
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:25,844
There's nothing to tell.

490
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,498
I'm going out for a few hours

491
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:30,547
to visit some old friends
from the tennis club and...

492
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:34,118
when I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.

493
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:36,072
Right?

494
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,043
But you won't say anything

495
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:41,425
because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?

496
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:43,374
How could we sue anybody?

497
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:51,582
Oh... do you need
some money, Frankie?

498
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:55,311
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

499
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:58,389
Here, take five dollars.

500
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,410
Or-Or ten.

501
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:07,711
You promised you were going
to quit.

502
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:09,690
( slams )

503
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,585
( children laughing )

504
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:17,995
( dog barking in distance )

505
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:28,599
Ma, I'm home!

506
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:40,289
( door opens )

507
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,530
Hey, hey!

508
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:45,866
You... You stay away from me,
hear me?

509
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,585
You stay away from me--
I don't know who you are

510
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,818
but if you ever
come back here again--

511
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,056
Frankie! Frank, Frank,
calm down, will you?

512
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:52,290
I'm Dick Kesner.

513
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:54,430
Now, I want you
to leave your things here

514
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:56,440
and follow me
into the next room, okay?

515
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:57,997
They're all waiting for you.

516
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,485
PAULA:
You don't have to be scared.

517
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:05,106
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.

518
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:06,795
But there are laws.

519
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,001
Everything in this country has
to be legal.

520
00:26:09,073 --> 00:26:11,960
So what we need to do is
make some decisions.

521
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:13,575
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.

522
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:15,785
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts

523
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:17,216
but that can be
very expensive, Frank

524
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:18,830
people fighting
over their children.

525
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:20,487
Nobody is fighting.

526
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:23,082
Look at me, Frank.
Nobody is fighting.

527
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:25,423
( speaking French )

528
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,661
( quietly ):
Dad, what's going on?

529
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:29,181
Dad, what's going on?

530
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:31,712
( speaking French continues )

531
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:33,336
Do you remember your grandma,
Eve?

532
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:35,025
She arrived this morning.

533
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:36,458
( speaks French )

534
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:37,951
Hello.

535
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:49,175
Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?

536
00:26:50,836 --> 00:26:54,630
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

537
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,097
( speaking French )

538
00:26:57,196 --> 00:26:58,324
Nothing's gonna change.

539
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:00,012
We're still gonna see
each other.

540
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,897
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.

541
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:04,200
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.

542
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,958
Most of it's for your parents--
boring adult business--

543
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,648
but this paragraph right here,
this is important

544
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,641
because it states
who you're gonna live with...

545
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:14,519
after the divorce...

546
00:27:14,588 --> 00:27:16,435
whose custody you will be in.

547
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:19,511
And there's a blank space
right here.

548
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,460
( Eve speaking French )

549
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:21,887
And I want you to go
into the kitchen

550
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:23,436
sit at the table

551
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:25,093
and put a name down.

552
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,426
You can take
as long as you want

553
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:28,045
but when you come back
into this room...

554
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:30,642
I want to see a name
on that line.

555
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:34,311
Frank, just write down a name
and this will all be over.

556
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,162
It's gonna be okay.

557
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:37,913
FRANK:
Dad, what name?

558
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:39,045
Your mother or your father.

559
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:41,188
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

560
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:44,181
And don't look so scared.

561
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:45,896
It's not a test.

562
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:47,880
There's no wrong answer.

563
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,137
( man announcing trains
indistinctly )

564
00:27:56,124 --> 00:28:00,338
( melancholy jazz playing )

565
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:01,313
Hi.

566
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,375
( panting )

567
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:03,910
One ticket to Grand Central,
please.

568
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:07,118
That'll be $3.50, sir.

569
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:09,910
Is it okay
if I write you a check?

570
00:28:14,814 --> 00:28:17,535
Carl, when do I get
to call my father?

571
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:20,005
You can call him
when we get to New York.

572
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:23,246
We leave for the airport
in seven hours.

573
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,418
Until then, just sit there.

574
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,111
Be quiet.

575
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:30,449
You know, Carl,
on the other side of the hotel

576
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,266
they got suites
that face the park.

577
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,416
It's the best room
the FBI can afford.

578
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:40,731
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

579
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,067
Mr. Mudrick...

580
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,364
Mr. Mudrick, please.
You have to listen.

581
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,115
I don't want to hear your story.

582
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,835
This is two checks that bounced.

583
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:48,620
You know how much trouble
I'm in?

584
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:51,479
No, but listen, I'm telling you,
the bank, they made the mistake.

585
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:52,973
I'll write you another check
right now!

586
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,887
What, do I look like
I was born yesterday?

587
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:56,668
Look, it's midnight,
Mr. Mudrick.

588
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:57,645
Where am I gonna go?

589
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:59,227
You're a goddamn kid.

590
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:01,215
Go home.

591
00:29:02,937 --> 00:29:05,171
( baby crying in distance )

592
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:27,361
~ ~

593
00:29:36,229 --> 00:29:39,371
~ ~

594
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:48,812
I mean, I hope you understand.

595
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,598
My boss sent me to Brooklyn,
then Queens.

596
00:29:50,702 --> 00:29:52,062
Now he wants me in Long Island

597
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,464
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

598
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:58,292
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash checks from other banks.

599
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,173
How would we know
if they were any good?

600
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:01,824
What did you say your name was?

601
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:02,958
Ashley.

602
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:06,041
Ashley... you know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?

603
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:13,440
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

604
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:21,358
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

605
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:23,763
Well, you see, it's my
grandmother's birthday next week

606
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,746
and I want to get her
something extra-special.

607
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:27,394
Please, I mean

608
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,801
it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

609
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:30,863
( raspy coughing )

610
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:32,752
Please, it's just five dollars.

611
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,303
No one would have to know.

612
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:36,867
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed

613
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:40,182
to take checks
from people we don't know.

614
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,991
( horns honking,
whistle blowing )

615
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:03,381
~ ~

616
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:14,614
( women laughing )

617
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,560
Pleasure to have you back,
Captain Carlson.

618
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,957
What do you think, Angelo?

619
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:25,541
The tomatoes are ripe
this afternoon.

620
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:27,561
( women giggling )

621
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,432
Well, what have we here?

622
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:36,419
-Can I have your autograph?
-You betcha.

623
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:38,366
-Can I have your autograph, too?
-You gonna be a pilot?

624
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,468
-Mm-hmm!
-All right, then.

625
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:41,969
There you go.
Work hard in school.

626
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,295
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

627
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:45,820
I have decided to become
an airline pilot.

628
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:48,163
I have applied
to all the big airlines

629
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:51,175
and I have several
promising interviews lined up.

630
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:52,899
How's Mom?

631
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,850
Have you called her lately?

632
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:56,886
Love, your son, Frank.

633
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,920
Hello.

634
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,257
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School

635
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:06,694
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

636
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:07,987
You're the young man

637
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,873
who's writing the article
for the school paper.

638
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:11,302
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know

639
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:13,249
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.

640
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:15,517
What airports
does Pan Am fly to?

641
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,500
What does a pilot make
in a year?

642
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,893
And who tells them
where they're gonna fly to?

643
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:20,023
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

644
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,258
Just take 'em one at a time.

645
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:22,426
All right. What does it mean

646
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:23,981
when one pilot says
to another pilot:

647
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:25,482
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

648
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,949
They just want to know what kind
of aircraft you're flying:

649
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,342
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

650
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:31,932
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

651
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,075
Well, every pilot has to have
two things with him

652
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:36,249
at all times: One is
his airline personnel badge--

653
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:38,235
looks just like this one here,
from Pan Am--

654
00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:40,791
the other one is
their FAA license...

655
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:43,132
and that looks just like this.

656
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:47,350
Oh. Sir, do you think I can
make a copy of this

657
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:48,514
to put into my article?

658
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:50,269
Oh, Frank,
you can have that one.

659
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:51,667
It's three years expired.

660
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,185
Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. badge?

661
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:54,687
You have an extra one
I could borrow?

662
00:32:54,787 --> 00:32:56,667
Oh, no, I can't help you there.

663
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,580
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

664
00:32:58,647 --> 00:33:00,040
The only way
to get one of those

665
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:02,630
is to become a real live pilot
for Pan American Airways.

666
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:05,362
( dialing phone )

667
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,243
( car horns honking,
whistle blowing )

668
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:08,793
WOMAN ( over phone ):
Pan Am, may I help you?

669
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:10,261
FRANK ( Southern accent ):
Yeah, hello.

670
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:11,269
I'm calling about a uniform.

671
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:13,016
WOMAN:
Hold for Purchasing.

672
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:13,993
FRANK:
Thank you.

673
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:15,289
WOMAN 2:
Purchasing.

674
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,752
FRANK ( Southern accent ):
Hi. I'm a copilot

675
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,014
based out of San Francisco.

676
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,865
I flew a flight
into New York last night

677
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:20,873
but the problem is

678
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:22,942
I'm headed out to, uh, Paris
in three hours.

679
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:24,796
WOMAN 2:
How can we help you?

680
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:26,128
FRANK:
I sent my uniform

681
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:27,944
to be cleaned through the hotel

682
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:30,248
and I... I guess
they must have lost it.

683
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:32,718
WOMAN 2:
They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.

684
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:34,697
Go down to the Well-Built
Uniform Company

685
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:35,757
at Ninth and Broadway.

686
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,227
They're our uniform supplier.

687
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:38,843
I'll tell Mr. Rosen
you're coming.

688
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,018
ROSEN:
You look too young
to be a pilot.

689
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:42,771
I'm a copilot.

690
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:44,392
Why so nervous?

691
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:46,213
How would you feel if you, uh

692
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:48,706
lost your uniform
first week on the job?

693
00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:50,264
Relax.

694
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:52,761
Pan Am's got lots of uniforms.

695
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,004
It's gonna be $164.

696
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:57,310
Great. I'll, uh,
I'll write you a check.

697
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:59,317
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

698
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:01,460
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number

699
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:02,495
and then I'll bill Pan Am.

700
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,420
They'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

701
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:08,179
Even better.

702
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:12,045
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

703
00:34:12,112 --> 00:34:14,900
You always told me that an
honest man has nothing to fear.

704
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,881
So I'm trying my best
not to be afraid.

705
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:20,798
I'm sorry I ran away,
but you don 't have to worry.

706
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,843
I'm gonna get it all back
now, Daddy.

707
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,639
I promise.
I'm going to get it all back.

708
00:34:25,741 --> 00:34:27,654
( approving murmur )

709
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:33,235
GIRL:
Are you a real live pilot?

710
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,369
I sure am, little lady.
What's your name?

711
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:36,350
Celine.

712
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,230
Celine, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

713
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:40,268
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

714
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,502
That's fifty, seventy

715
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:50,335
eighty, ninety,
one hundred dollars.

716
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:52,216
You have yourself a great time
in Paris.

717
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:53,767
I always do.

718
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,729
Excuse me.

719
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,162
I'm John Modiger.
I manage this branch.

720
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:00,622
I want to thank you
for coming in

721
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:01,628
and using our institution.

722
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:02,656
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, John.

723
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:03,794
I'll be back again.

724
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:04,808
Good.

725
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:06,324
Have you stayed with us before?

726
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,608
Uh, no, I've been primarily
based on the West Coast.

727
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:12,919
Is it all right if I write you
a check for the room?

728
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,981
No problem, sir.

729
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:16,004
Great.

730
00:35:23,144 --> 00:35:24,239
Uh...

731
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,241
I was also wondering

732
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:27,098
if I could write you
a personal check?

733
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,508
For airline personnel, we cash
personal checks up to $100.

734
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:32,487
Payroll checks
we cash up to $300.

735
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:36,571
Did you say $300
for a payroll check?

736
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:39,010
( typewriter keys clacking )

737
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:43,388
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

738
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,913
I've decided to become a pilot
for Pan American Airways...

739
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,295
the most trusted name
in the skies.

740
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:51,398
They've accepted me
into their training program

741
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:53,384
and told me that if I work hard

742
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,264
I should earn my wings
real soon.

743
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:57,889
Please get in touch with Joanna
Carlton from the tenth grade.

744
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:01,104
Tell her I'm sorry that I could
not take her to the Junior Prom.

745
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:03,087
Love, your son, Frank.

746
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,867

749
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,985
Hello, how are you?

750
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:43,154
Fine, thank you.

751
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:45,109
I have a payroll check here
I'd like to cash.

752
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:46,724
Certainly.

753
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:47,738
Thank you.

754
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:50,754
Uh, excuse me.

755
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:52,602
I'm sure you hear this
all the time

756
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:54,905
but you have the most
beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

757
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,990
Yeah, I do get that
all the time.

758
00:36:58,058 --> 00:36:59,938
( nervous laugh )

759
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:01,553
How would you like it?

760
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,794
~ ~

761
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,135
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

762
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:21,151
We won't have any cash until
the banks open in an hour

763
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:22,874
but, uh, I'm sure

764
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:25,047
they can cash your check
at the airport.

765
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:26,579
The airport?

766
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,913
Who cashes checks
at the airport?

767
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:29,922
Well, the airlines, sir.

768
00:37:30,021 --> 00:37:32,388
They've always taken care
of their own.

769
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,240
( jet passing overhead )

770
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:37,898
( indistinct flight announcement
over P.A. )

771
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:41,657
Hello.

772
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,282
Hi. Are you deadheading?

773
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,038
What?

774
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:46,989
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

775
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,323
Mi...?

776
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,654
Yes, yes.

777
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:51,784
( laughs )

778
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:54,125
Yeah, I'm the deadhead.
Here you go.

779
00:37:54,227 --> 00:37:57,568
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

780
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:00,163
( chuckling ):
You know

781
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:01,713
it's been awhile
since I've done this.

782
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,181
Which one's the jump seat again?

783
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,615
( both laughing )

784
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:07,197
Have a nice flight.

785
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:09,406
Are you my deadhead?

786
00:38:11,718 --> 00:38:13,465
STEWARDESS:
Frank, Captain Oliver.

787
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,082
-John Larkin, the copilot.
-Hello.

788
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,218
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.

789
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:17,353
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.

790
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,208
Thanks for giving me a lift,
boys.

791
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:20,959
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.

792
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,091
We're about to push.

793
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,334
What kind of equipment you on,
DC-8?

794
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:25,987
Uh, 707.

795
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,648
You turning around
on the redeye?

796
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:30,722
Uh, I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months

797
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,577
trying to earn my keep
running leapfrogs

798
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:33,708
for the weak and weary.

799
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:36,703
No shame in that.
We all did it.

800
00:38:43,064 --> 00:38:44,004
Have a seat.

801
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:45,097
Thank you.

802
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:48,380
Would you like a drink
after takeoff?

803
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,230
M-Milk?

804
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,395
OLIVER:
80 knots.

805
00:38:51,468 --> 00:38:52,463
LARKIN:
Check.

806
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,899
V-one. Rotate.

807
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:56,820
( jet engines roaring )

808
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:58,800
V-two. Positive rate.

809
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:01,035
Gear up.

810
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:02,464
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

811
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:03,893
Today was graduation.

812
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:05,509
I am now a copilot

813
00:39:05,616 --> 00:39:08,758
earning $1,400 a month
plus benefits

814
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:10,741
and the best part is

815
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:12,909
they tell me
my family can fly for free.

816
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:16,157
So tell Mom to pack her bags
and buy a new swimsuit

817
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:19,335
because I'm taking us all
to Hawaii for Christmas.

818
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:20,700
I love you, Dad.

819
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:22,682
Aloha, Frank.

820
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:25,171
Hello, deadhead.

821
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:26,078
Hello.

822
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:27,693
Enjoying your free ride?

823
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:36,000
Marci...

824
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,019
did you drop this?

825
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:42,303
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

826
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:43,630
No...

827
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,248
( chuckling )

828
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,203
( giggling ):
No!

829
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,852
No...

830
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:51,479
MARCI:
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

831
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:53,919
( Frank moans passionately )

832
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,080
Yes!

833
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:56,901
( clanking and clattering )

834
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:57,999
( Marci panting )

835
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:03,575
Why are you stopping?

836
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,925
I want to tell you something,
Marci.

837
00:40:07,026 --> 00:40:10,621
This is by far...

838
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:15,128
the best date I have ever
been on.

839
00:40:15,236 --> 00:40:17,370
( laughing )

840
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:29,666
~ ~

841
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:36,318
WOMAN:
I'd like to open a Money Market,
please.

842
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,306
Okay.

843
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,073
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

844
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:50,315
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

845
00:40:50,352 --> 00:40:53,006
I'd like to cash
this check here, and then

846
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:55,965
I'd like to take you out
for a steak dinner.

847
00:40:57,394 --> 00:40:58,843
( laughing )

848
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:05,426
( teller giggling )

849
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:08,396
And then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine

850
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:09,665
which uses special ink

851
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:12,104
to encode the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks.

852
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:16,387
And where are these numbers?

853
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:18,621
They're, um... right here.

854
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:19,954
Right there?

855
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:21,085
See?

856
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:23,426
( both giggling )

857
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:25,399
They're called routing numbers.

858
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:27,576
So where do the checks
get routed to?

859
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:30,889
You know, I don't exactly know.

860
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:32,385
Nobody ever
asked me that before.

861
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:34,843
AUCTIONEER:
Our next item up for bid

862
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:37,045
is also from the Jersey
Central Bank foreclosure.

863
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:38,210
This is a MICR encoder

864
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:39,866
a machine used
to encode bank checks.

865
00:41:39,938 --> 00:41:41,132
Do I have an opening bid?

866
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:43,140
HANRATTY:
Our unknown subject
is a paperhanger

867
00:41:43,215 --> 00:41:44,830
who started working
on the East Coast.

868
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,938
In the last few weeks,
this unsub has developed

869
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:49,445
a new form of check fraud
which I'm calling "the float. "

870
00:41:49,543 --> 00:41:50,449
What he's doing is

871
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,462
he's opening checking accounts
at various banks

872
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,308
then changing the MICR ink
routing numbers

873
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,607
at the bottom of those checks.

874
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:56,771
Next slide, please.

875
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:58,005
( projector clanks )

876
00:41:58,077 --> 00:41:59,924
Next slide, please.

877
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:01,417
Uh, the remote thing is broken.

878
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,812
You'll have to do it by hand.

879
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,041
You've gotta... try the...

880
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:05,472
Agent Mullen, it should be...

881
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:08,030
it should be the square button
just there by the side.

882
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:09,200
This carousel doesn't work.

883
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:10,666
It's a bad carousel
you got there.

884
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:11,693
Thank you, Agent Mullen.

885
00:42:11,771 --> 00:42:12,899
Got to move it manually.

886
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:15,372
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

887
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,350
Slide.

888
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:18,412
( clicking )

889
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,880
MICR scanners at every bank

890
00:42:19,948 --> 00:42:22,282
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check--

891
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,511
slide--

892
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,725
and then, ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

893
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:29,383
Carl, for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud

894
00:42:29,456 --> 00:42:31,137
you mind telling us
what the hell

895
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:33,121
you're talking about?

896
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:36,981
The East Coast branches are
numbered zero-one to zero-six.

897
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:38,962
The central branch
is zero-seven, zero-eight

898
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,088
so on, so forth.

899
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:41,679
You mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check

900
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:42,782
actually mean something?

901
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:45,124
All of this was in the report
I filed two days ago.

902
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:49,143
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two

903
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,938
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York

904
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,555
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch

905
00:42:53,662 --> 00:42:54,757
but it is rerouted

906
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:58,006
all the way to the San Francisco
Federal Branch.

907
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,797
The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks

908
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,714
which means our unsub can stay
in one place

909
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,363
paper the same city
over and over again

910
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:05,895
while his checks circle
the country.

911
00:43:05,994 --> 00:43:09,202
You know,
you want to talk to my wife.

912
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:11,793
She's the one balances
the checkbook at our house.

913
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:14,488
( agents laughing )

914
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:18,643
Next slide.

915
00:43:18,714 --> 00:43:24,157
( three-piece combo
plays softjazz )

916
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:25,489
Daddy!

917
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,656
( chuckling )

918
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:30,167
My son, the birdman.

919
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,173
Some uniform, Frank.

920
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:33,087
What do you think?

921
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:34,702
Nice.

922
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:36,324
Sit down.

923
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:37,725
( clears throat )

924
00:43:39,352 --> 00:43:41,354
So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?

925
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:42,688
Of course.

926
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:44,926
This fork is ice cold.

927
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:48,428
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.

928
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:52,971
( whispering ):
It's a fancy restaurant,
you know.

929
00:43:53,078 --> 00:43:56,286
( sighing )

930
00:43:56,355 --> 00:43:58,655
Well, here...

931
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:00,537
I-I got you something.

932
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:02,221
What's that?

933
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:04,206
Open it.

934
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:10,166
You know what those are, right?

935
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:12,150
Those are the keys

936
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:15,534
to a 1965 Cadillac
DeVille convertible.

937
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:16,934
Brand-new, Dad.

938
00:44:16,974 --> 00:44:19,774
Red with white interior

939
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:23,820
split seats,
air conditioning, the works.

940
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:25,065
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

941
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:26,776
Yeah. I'm giving you a Cadillac.

942
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:28,994
Dad, sh-she's parked downstairs.

943
00:44:29,111 --> 00:44:30,355
When we're done eating lunch

944
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:32,844
why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house

945
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:34,945
pick her up,
take a little joyride?

946
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:37,980
Do you know what would happen
if the IRS found out

947
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:41,364
I was driving around
in a new coupe?

948
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:43,620
I took the train here, Frank.

949
00:44:43,737 --> 00:44:45,682
I'm taking the train home.

950
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,300
All right.

951
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,807
I have plenty of money.

952
00:44:57,923 --> 00:45:00,140
You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...

953
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:01,425
You worried?

954
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,642
About me?

955
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,550
No, I'm not... I'm not worried.

956
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,690
You think I can't buy
my own car?

957
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:12,359
Two mice fell
in a bucket of cream, Frank.

958
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,150
Which one am I?

959
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,757
You're that second mouse.

960
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:22,050
I went by the store today.

961
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,879
I had to close the store
for awhile.

962
00:45:23,957 --> 00:45:25,318
It's all about timing, Frank.

963
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:27,070
The goddamn government
knows that.

964
00:45:27,148 --> 00:45:28,626
They hit you when you're down.

965
00:45:28,704 --> 00:45:31,505
I wasn't going to let them
take it from me, so I just...

966
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:34,386
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

967
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:41,118
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.

968
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,452
I understand, I...

969
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:46,526
Have you told Ma?

970
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:52,597
She's so stubborn, your mother.

971
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,644
Don't worry.

972
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,940
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

973
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:00,146
I been fighting for us...

974
00:46:00,187 --> 00:46:01,548
( gasps quietly )

975
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,310
Dad?

976
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:09,058
...since the day we... we met.

977
00:46:09,175 --> 00:46:11,237
Daddy, out of all those men

978
00:46:11,316 --> 00:46:14,273
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.

979
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:18,087
200 men, sitting in
that tiny social hall

980
00:46:18,165 --> 00:46:19,565
watching her dance.

981
00:46:22,056 --> 00:46:24,429
What was the name of that town?

982
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:25,713
Montrichard, Dad.

983
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:27,192
Yeah.

984
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:29,994
I didn't speak a word of French

985
00:46:30,073 --> 00:46:33,302
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...

986
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,219
She's your wife.

987
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:39,501
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.

988
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:43,236
I think that calls for a toast.

989
00:46:43,354 --> 00:46:44,598
( softjazz playing )

990
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:50,592
( inhaling deeply )

991
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:53,860
To the best damn pilot
in the sky.

992
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,494
It's not what you think.

993
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:58,101
I'm just a copilot.

994
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:01,526
You see these people staring
at you?

995
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,547
These are
the most powerful people

996
00:47:06,664 --> 00:47:08,142
in New York City

997
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:10,321
and they keep peeking
over their shoulders

998
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:12,345
wondering where
you're going tonight.

999
00:47:12,385 --> 00:47:14,251
Where you going, Frank?

1000
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,364
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

1001
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:19,466
Some place exotic?

1002
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:24,097
Just tell me where you're going.

1003
00:47:25,848 --> 00:47:28,065
Los An... Hollywood.

1004
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,518
Hollywood.

1005
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,305
( sniffles )

1006
00:47:35,383 --> 00:47:37,405
( whispering ):
The rest of us...

1007
00:47:37,484 --> 00:47:39,973
really are suckers.

1008
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:47,406
So, I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

1009
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:49,157
And I got a bra,
like, out here, okay?

1010
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,180
And I'm chasing
these two Puerto Rican guys

1011
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:52,465
through the park.

1012
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:54,722
They got a suitcase filled
with bank robbery loot.

1013
00:47:54,801 --> 00:47:56,513
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"FBI, freeze!"

1014
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,275
And I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

1015
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:00,288
It's so damn big

1016
00:48:00,366 --> 00:48:02,855
I thought I was going
to shoot my tits off.

1017
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:04,023
( laughing )

1018
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,980
You know, that's a funny story.

1019
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,614
People always laugh
at that story.

1020
00:48:08,694 --> 00:48:10,522
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.

1021
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,544
If you were having
so much fun undercover

1022
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:14,218
why did you transfer
to bank fraud?

1023
00:48:14,336 --> 00:48:15,231
I didn't transfer.

1024
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,253
I was censured
and reassigned.

1025
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:20,628
It's like being punished.
I was punished.

1026
00:48:20,706 --> 00:48:22,106
I screwed up in the field.

1027
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:23,740
What about you, Mr. Fox?

1028
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,087
Were you... punished
for screwing up in the field?

1029
00:48:25,088 --> 00:48:27,617
Oh, no, no, no, I've never
worked in the field before.

1030
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:29,251
I audited
background investigations

1031
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:31,351
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

1032
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:32,652
Well, that's just great.

1033
00:48:32,653 --> 00:48:33,337
I ask for a team

1034
00:48:33,338 --> 00:48:35,282
and they drag the bottom
of the Pacific.

1035
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,851
You mind if I ask you
a question, Agent Hanratty?

1036
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:40,913
How come you're so serious
all the time?

1037
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:43,209
Does it bother you,
Mr. Amdursky?

1038
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:45,777
Yeah. Yeah, it does bother me.

1039
00:48:45,895 --> 00:48:47,268
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?

1040
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:48,747
A little, I guess.

1041
00:48:50,225 --> 00:48:53,882
Well, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

1042
00:48:53,922 --> 00:48:57,696
Yeah. Yeah, we'd love
to hear a joke from you.

1043
00:48:57,736 --> 00:49:00,653
Knock, knock.

1044
00:49:00,733 --> 00:49:02,289
Who's there?

1045
00:49:04,468 --> 00:49:07,425
Go fuck yourselves.

1046
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:09,799
( swing music playing
on car radio )

1047
00:49:14,314 --> 00:49:16,609
~ Tall and tan
and young and lovely ~

1048
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,711
~ The girl from Ipanema... ~

1049
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,994
MAN:
He cashed three checks.

1050
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:21,512
They all cleared.

1051
00:49:21,552 --> 00:49:24,353
I was going to deposit
this one today.

1052
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:27,310
I don't want any trouble.

1053
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:29,916
No trouble.

1054
00:49:29,957 --> 00:49:31,513
No trouble at all.

1055
00:49:31,592 --> 00:49:33,304
We'll just take this check
and be on our way.

1056
00:49:33,382 --> 00:49:34,277
Thank you.

1057
00:49:34,393 --> 00:49:35,326
Good.

1058
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:37,700
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

1059
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:39,723
~...Each one she passes
goes ahh... ~

1060
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:41,825
What are you saying,
he's still here?

1061
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:45,015
201.

1062
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:47,079
~...Oh, but he watches
so sadly... ~

1063
00:49:47,157 --> 00:49:48,090
Thank you.

1064
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,646
Corner here.

1065
00:49:49,726 --> 00:49:50,815
Oh, thanks, son.

1066
00:49:50,893 --> 00:49:52,799
~...How can he tell her
he loves her... ~

1067
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:53,888
Some steps.

1068
00:49:54,006 --> 00:49:55,600
Steps.

1069
00:49:58,209 --> 00:50:00,075
Hey, Mr. Murphy, how are you?

1070
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:01,204
Is that Frank?

1071
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:02,178
Yeah, it's Frank.

1072
00:50:02,217 --> 00:50:03,306
Hey, Frank, how are you?

1073
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:04,434
How's the knee?

1074
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:05,796
Come on,
I'll race you right now.

1075
00:50:05,876 --> 00:50:07,782
( chuckling ):
Take care.

1076
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,338
Okay, Frank.

1077
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:10,467
AMDURSKY:
"Eyeball the back"?

1078
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:12,061
Come on, Carl,
this guy's a pen and ink man.

1079
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,074
A goddamn paperhanger.

1080
00:50:13,152 --> 00:50:14,163
He doesn't even carry a gun.

1081
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:15,408
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

1082
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:17,121
You just keep your eyes open,
do your job

1083
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,416
and I'll buy you both
a Good Humor bar.

1084
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:27,004
( grunts )

1085
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:28,640
( gasps )

1086
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:29,768
It's all right, ma'am. FBI.

1087
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:31,168
( whimpers )

1088
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:35,916
201... 201, 201.

1089
00:50:35,956 --> 00:50:37,628
201...

1090
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:42,920
201... 201... 201... 201...

1091
00:50:42,961 --> 00:50:44,867
( anxious breathing )

1092
00:50:44,906 --> 00:50:46,696
( music building dramatically )

1093
00:50:46,774 --> 00:50:48,213
FBI!

1094
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,724
( crunching )

1095
00:50:55,842 --> 00:50:57,009
( toilet flushing )

1096
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,719
FBI!

1097
00:50:58,799 --> 00:51:01,716
Come out of the bathroom!

1098
00:51:01,834 --> 00:51:03,896
Step out of the bathroom!

1099
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:08,722
Hands on your head.

1100
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,512
Oh, that's the new
IBM Selectric.

1101
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,679
Put your hands on your head.

1102
00:51:11,796 --> 00:51:13,157
You can change the print type
in five seconds.

1103
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,519
-Shut up!
-Just pop out the ball.

1104
00:51:14,598 --> 00:51:16,388
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands...!

1105
00:51:16,465 --> 00:51:18,371
You know, he's got over 200
checks here, a gallon

1106
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,201
-of India ink, drafting.
-Hands on your head!

1107
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:21,835
Even has
little payroll envelopes

1108
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,002
addressed to himself
from Pan Am.

1109
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:23,976
Put it down! Drop it!

1110
00:51:24,054 --> 00:51:24,987
Relax.

1111
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:26,778
You're late, all right?

1112
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:28,295
My name's Allen, Barry Allen

1113
00:51:28,374 --> 00:51:29,657
United States Secret Service.

1114
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:31,336
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

1115
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:32,581
My partner has him
in custody downstairs.

1116
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,749
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1117
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:36,707
You think the FBI
are the only ones on this guy?

1118
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:37,835
I mean, come on.

1119
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,625
Come on, he's dabbling
in government checks here.

1120
00:51:39,665 --> 00:51:41,609
We've been following
a paper trail on this guy

1121
00:51:41,688 --> 00:51:43,127
for months now.

1122
00:51:43,206 --> 00:51:45,617
Hey, you mind taking that gun
out of my face?

1123
00:51:45,697 --> 00:51:46,708
Please. Really.

1124
00:51:46,825 --> 00:51:47,952
I mean, it makes me nervous.

1125
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,705
Let me see some credentials.

1126
00:51:49,783 --> 00:51:52,856
Yeah, sure.

1127
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:54,335
Take my whole wallet.

1128
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:55,774
( clears throat )

1129
00:51:55,854 --> 00:51:57,021
You want my gun, too?

1130
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:58,653
Come over here. Take my gun.

1131
00:51:58,733 --> 00:52:00,677
Hey, hey, look,
just do me a favor.

1132
00:52:00,757 --> 00:52:02,196
Take a look outside. Look.

1133
00:52:02,313 --> 00:52:03,324
Look out the window.

1134
00:52:03,442 --> 00:52:05,698
My partner's walking him
to the car as we speak-- Look.

1135
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:10,328
Old guy almost pissed
in his pants

1136
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:12,080
when I came through the door.

1137
00:52:12,158 --> 00:52:13,830
He jumped
right through the window

1138
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,115
onto the hood of my car.

1139
00:52:15,194 --> 00:52:17,100
Hey, Murph?

1140
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,852
-Yeah?
-Call the LAPD again.

1141
00:52:18,968 --> 00:52:21,302
I don't want people walking
through my crime scene.

1142
00:52:21,342 --> 00:52:23,364
( raspy cough )

1143
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:25,817
I didn't expect
the Secret Service on this.

1144
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:26,944
Don't worry about it.

1145
00:52:27,023 --> 00:52:28,112
( clears throat )

1146
00:52:28,192 --> 00:52:29,397
Well, what's your name?

1147
00:52:29,475 --> 00:52:32,782
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

1148
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:36,245
( sighs )

1149
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:38,814
Mind if I see
some identification?

1150
00:52:38,932 --> 00:52:40,371
Sure.

1151
00:52:40,488 --> 00:52:43,834
You never can be too careful
these days.

1152
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:45,235
Well, tough luck, Carl.

1153
00:52:45,313 --> 00:52:47,025
Five minutes earlier

1154
00:52:47,103 --> 00:52:48,659
you would've landed yourself
a pretty good collar.

1155
00:52:48,738 --> 00:52:49,671
It's all right.

1156
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,656
Ten seconds later,
and you'd have been shot.

1157
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:54,419
Mind if I come downstairs
with you?

1158
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:56,097
I-I got to take a look
at this guy.

1159
00:52:56,098 --> 00:52:57,109
Sure thing.

1160
00:52:57,189 --> 00:52:58,901
Just, uh, do me a favor
and sit tight for a second

1161
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:00,184
while I get
this evidence downstairs.

1162
00:53:00,263 --> 00:53:02,285
You know, I don't want
some maid walking through here

1163
00:53:02,364 --> 00:53:03,297
and making the bed.

1164
00:53:03,336 --> 00:53:04,307
LAPD should be here any sec.

1165
00:53:04,427 --> 00:53:05,476
Wait.

1166
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:11,741
Your wallet.

1167
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,532
You hang onto it for a minute.

1168
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,516
I trust you.

1169
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:20,964
( sighs )

1170
00:53:21,082 --> 00:53:24,544
( exhaling )

1171
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:26,140
( groans )

1172
00:53:26,258 --> 00:53:27,307
Oh...

1173
00:53:27,385 --> 00:53:31,003
( chuckling )

1174
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:33,456
Yeah...

1175
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:35,402
Secret Service.

1176
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:39,799
( ominous music begins )

1177
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:51,823
~ ~

1178
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:05,793
~ ~

1179
00:54:10,153 --> 00:54:12,448
( music building )

1180
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:18,090
Hey!

1181
00:54:18,169 --> 00:54:20,191
Oh, goddamn it!

1182
00:54:20,232 --> 00:54:22,643
It was stupid.

1183
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:24,122
I made a stupid mistake.

1184
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:26,106
Forget about it.

1185
00:54:26,147 --> 00:54:28,442
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

1186
00:54:28,521 --> 00:54:29,960
I-I can get this guy, Sean.

1187
00:54:30,077 --> 00:54:33,189
The worst thing a paperhanger
can do is show his face.

1188
00:54:33,268 --> 00:54:34,239
I read the report.

1189
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,574
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age

1190
00:54:36,654 --> 00:54:37,703
160 pounds.

1191
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:39,026
This could be almost anybody.

1192
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:41,244
I heard his voice, Sean,
I saw his face.

1193
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:43,891
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

1194
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:46,342
Just be careful.

1195
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:47,937
You got 12 years in.

1196
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:49,767
Nobody bothers you
down on the first floor.

1197
00:54:49,845 --> 00:54:51,751
You practically wrote the book
on bank fraud.

1198
00:54:51,753 --> 00:54:53,153
That's the kind of thing

1199
00:54:53,231 --> 00:54:55,097
that can make you
section chief someday.

1200
00:54:55,177 --> 00:54:58,639
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

1201
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:00,001
What type of position?

1202
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,438
Position of being humiliated.

1203
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:14,867
Sean, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

1204
00:55:14,984 --> 00:55:17,785
Yeah, sure.

1205
00:55:17,825 --> 00:55:20,782
( pointedly ):
Knock, knock!

1206
00:55:22,378 --> 00:55:26,074
FRANK:
So, my-my next question is,
when a pilot retires

1207
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,421
uh, Pan Am sends them
a check every single month?

1208
00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:33,233
Uh, yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

1209
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:34,752
How much is that check for?

1210
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,281
Uh, kid, I'm really not
in the mood for this right now.

1211
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:38,799
This Skywayman's
driving me crazy.

1212
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,161
Who's the Skywayman?

1213
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,285
Ah, some nut that's flying
around the country

1214
00:55:41,286 --> 00:55:42,453
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

1215
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:46,227
There's a column about him
in the paper today.

1216
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:54,681
I keep telling them
this is not my problem.

1217
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,588
This guy
doesn't even fly Pan Am.

1218
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:57,872
Flies everybody else.

1219
00:55:57,913 --> 00:56:00,402
Flies United, TWA,
Continental, Eastern...

1220
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,853
( whispering ):
The Skywayman.

1221
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:05,149
Newspaper loves this clown.

1222
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:08,457
They call him
"the James Bond of the sky."

1223
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:11,180
( chuckles )

1224
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,191
Did you say...?

1225
00:56:12,271 --> 00:56:13,983
Bond, James Bond.

1226
00:56:14,061 --> 00:56:15,889
( "007" theme playing )

1227
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,386
BOND:
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

1228
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:26,786
WOMAN:
He likes to win.

1229
00:56:26,865 --> 00:56:27,798
MAN:
Come on, come on.

1230
00:56:27,876 --> 00:56:29,276
WOMAN:
We'll be landing
in 20 minutes.

1231
00:56:29,316 --> 00:56:32,001
Do you want to play it easy
or the hard way?

1232
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,945
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

1233
00:56:34,025 --> 00:56:37,254
Well, Pussy, you do know a lot
more about planes than guns.

1234
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,433
( imitating Sean Connery ):
Hello, Pussy.

1235
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:40,679
( normal voice ):
Now, you're sure

1236
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,924
this is the suit, right?

1237
00:56:42,003 --> 00:56:43,052
Positive.

1238
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:44,843
It's the exact suit he wore
in the movie.

1239
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:46,787
( Connery voice ):
Okay. I'll take three.

1240
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:48,423
Certainly, Mr. Fleming.

1241
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:50,679
Now what you need is
one of those

1242
00:56:50,797 --> 00:56:53,636
little foreign sports cars
that he drives.

1243
00:56:53,716 --> 00:56:56,167
( "007" theme playing )

1244
00:56:56,285 --> 00:56:58,696
( engine revving )

1245
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:08,074
( final "007" chord strikes )

1246
00:57:12,551 --> 00:57:16,870
~ The look of love ~

1247
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:20,099
~ Is in your eyes... ~

1248
00:57:20,178 --> 00:57:21,073
Hello.

1249
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,356
Hi.

1250
00:57:22,474 --> 00:57:24,730
~...The look your heart... ~

1251
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:27,454
Haven't I seen you before?

1252
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:29,478
~...Can't disguise... ~

1253
00:57:29,556 --> 00:57:30,761
Maybe.

1254
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,497
A couple years ago, I was
on the cover of Seventeen.

1255
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:35,938
Yeah.

1256
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:37,416
You're that model, right?

1257
00:57:37,456 --> 00:57:38,545
Cheryl.

1258
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:39,634
Yes.

1259
00:57:39,752 --> 00:57:42,981
The guys used to put
your picture on their lockers.

1260
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:47,416
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?

1261
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:50,725
Yeah. One of them.

1262
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:53,838
~ Well, it takes
my breath away... ~

1263
00:57:53,878 --> 00:57:57,146
So, think I could get
an autograph?

1264
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,936
~...I can hardly wait
to hold you ~

1265

~ Feel my arms around you... ~

1266
00:58:00,571 --> 00:58:02,283
Do you have a pen in your room?

1267
00:58:02,361 --> 00:58:04,033
~...How long I have waited... ~

1268
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,213
( rhythmic mechanical thumping )

1269
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:23,413
~ You've got the look of love ~

1270
00:58:23,453 --> 00:58:28,433
~ It's on your face ~

1271
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:37,071
~ A look that time
can't erase...~

1272
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,355
Shh.

1273
00:58:38,396 --> 00:58:39,796
~...Be mine tonight... ~

1274
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:44,544
Man like you can buy
anything he wants.

1275
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:47,579
~...Let this be
just the start ~

1276
00:58:47,696 --> 00:58:54,583
~ Of so many nights
like this... ~

1277
00:58:54,662 --> 00:58:57,347
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.

1278
00:58:57,425 --> 00:59:00,420
~...And then seal it
with a kiss... ~

1279
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:03,027
Well, you want
to see a card trick?

1280
00:59:03,145 --> 00:59:04,240
~...I can hardly wait
to hold you... ~

1281
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,991
How much did these cards cost?

1282
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:08,053
~...Feel my arms
around you... ~

1283
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:10,155
Oh, 55 cents, I think.

1284
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:12,645
~...Waited just
to love you... ~

1285
00:59:12,685 --> 00:59:18,443
And if they sold me downstairs
at the hotel gift shop...

1286
00:59:18,523 --> 00:59:20,934
how much would you pay?

1287
00:59:21,052 --> 00:59:23,074
I'm sor...

1288
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,732
I'm sorry, how mu...
how much would I pay for what?

1289
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:29,262
( romantic instrumental music
playing )

1290
00:59:29,341 --> 00:59:32,725
The entire night.

1291
00:59:32,804 --> 00:59:37,433
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?

1292
00:59:40,898 --> 00:59:44,244
Cheryl, I...
I really don't know.

1293
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:45,528
~...I can hardly wait
to hold you... ~

1294
00:59:45,568 --> 00:59:48,253
Don't be scared.

1295
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:51,210
~...How long I have waited... ~

1296
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:54,167
Make me an offer.

1297
00:59:54,285 --> 00:59:57,475
~...Now that I have found you ~

1298
00:59:57,515 --> 01:00:00,939
~ Don't ever go... ~

1299
01:00:01,017 --> 01:00:02,961
$300?

1300
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:04,869
Go fish.

1301
01:00:04,947 --> 01:00:07,242
( sheepish chuckle )

1302
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:10,705
Uh, $500?

1303
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:12,535
Go fish.

1304
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:13,546
( chuckles )

1305
01:00:13,586 --> 01:00:15,142
$600.

1306
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:16,426
( both chuckling )

1307
01:00:16,466 --> 01:00:18,761
Go fish.

1308
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,706
( saxophone playing sexy riff )

1309
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:22,691
$1,000.

1310
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,271
Okay.

1311
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,279
$1,000.

1312
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:33,082
Okay.

1313
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:35,455
I'll be right back.

1314
01:00:35,495 --> 01:00:37,401
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

1315
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:39,541
I'm going downstairs
to cash a check.

1316
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:43,161
You think this hotel is going
to cash a $1,000 check

1317
01:00:43,278 --> 01:00:44,522
at 3:00am?

1318
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,348
It's a New York Savings and Loan
check.

1319
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:50,438
It's like gold.

1320
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,487
They'll cash it.

1321
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:54,446
Don't you think they might get
a little suspicious?

1322
01:00:54,486 --> 01:00:55,419
Let me see that.

1323
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:58,025
It's a cashier's check.

1324
01:00:58,143 --> 01:00:59,699
Endorse it over to me.

1325
01:00:59,778 --> 01:01:01,528
No. I couldn't do that.

1326
01:01:01,606 --> 01:01:03,940
See, this check is for $1,400.

1327
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:06,392
We agreed upon $1,000.

1328
01:01:06,471 --> 01:01:12,852
Why don't I give you back $400
and you give me that check?

1329
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,498
Even better.

1330
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:22,891
~ The look of love ~

1331
01:01:22,932 --> 01:01:28,690
~ Is in your eyes... ~

1332
01:01:28,808 --> 01:01:30,830
( saxophone continues melody )

1333
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:48,770
Does this belong to anybody?

1334
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,395
~ Mele Kalikimaka
is the thing to say... ~

1335
01:02:02,496 --> 01:02:05,141
~ On a bright
Hawaiian Christmas Day... ~

1336
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,086
This is Hanratty.
Merry Christmas.

1337
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:08,566
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

1338
01:02:08,644 --> 01:02:10,316
Hello.

1339
01:02:10,396 --> 01:02:12,769
~...That we send to you,
from the land... ~

1340
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:14,713
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1341
01:02:14,793 --> 01:02:17,282
I've been trying
to track you down now

1342
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,344
for the last couple of hours.

1343
01:02:19,424 --> 01:02:20,551
What do you want?

1344
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:23,937
I wanted to apologize
for what happened

1345
01:02:24,015 --> 01:02:25,415
out in Los Angeles.

1346
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:26,544
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1347
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:28,568
No, no,
you don't apologize to me.

1348
01:02:28,646 --> 01:02:31,135
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

1349
01:02:31,176 --> 01:02:32,692
I volunteered

1350
01:02:32,771 --> 01:02:35,650
so men with families
could go home early.

1351
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:37,674
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring

1352
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:38,724
out in Los Angeles.

1353
01:02:38,803 --> 01:02:40,359
I thought maybe
you had a family.

1354
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:43,745
No. No family.

1355
01:02:43,823 --> 01:02:45,689
You want to talk to me...

1356
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:47,597
let's talk face-to-face.

1357
01:02:47,714 --> 01:02:48,997
All right.

1358
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:52,927
I'm at my suite at the
Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

1359
01:02:53,046 --> 01:02:57,014
In the morning, I leave
for Las Vegas for the weekend.

1360
01:02:57,093 --> 01:03:00,983
You think you're going
to get me again?

1361
01:03:01,023 --> 01:03:02,657
You're not going to Vegas.

1362
01:03:02,735 --> 01:03:04,641
You're not
in the Stuyvesant Arms.

1363
01:03:04,759 --> 01:03:06,275
You'd love for me

1364
01:03:06,393 --> 01:03:08,649
to send out 20 agents
Christmas Eve

1365
01:03:08,728 --> 01:03:11,373
we barge into your hotel,
knock down the door

1366
01:03:11,452 --> 01:03:13,474
so you can make fools
out of us all.

1367
01:03:13,553 --> 01:03:15,848
I'm really sorry
if I made a fool out of you.

1368
01:03:15,927 --> 01:03:16,976
I really am.

1369
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:17,989
Uh-uh, no.

1370
01:03:18,068 --> 01:03:19,312
No, listen, I really am.

1371
01:03:19,391 --> 01:03:21,647
No, no, you-you do not
feel sorry for me.

1372
01:03:21,726 --> 01:03:23,904
The truth is,
I knew it was you.

1373
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:26,395
Now maybe I didn't get the cuffs
on you, but I knew.

1374
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:30,480
Ah, people only know
what you tell them, Carl.

1375
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,982
Well, then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1376
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:37,174
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

1377
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:39,780
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

1378
01:03:39,898 --> 01:03:42,855
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

1379
01:03:42,973 --> 01:03:46,085
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

1380
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:48,264
No one ever bets on the uniform.

1381
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:50,301
You sure about that, Carl?

1382
01:03:50,379 --> 01:03:52,518
I'll tell you what I am sure of.

1383
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:54,386
You're going to get caught.

1384
01:03:54,504 --> 01:03:57,421
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact.

1385
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:58,939
It's-It's like Vegas.

1386
01:03:59,017 --> 01:04:00,300
The House always wins.

1387
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,446
Well, Carl, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

1388
01:04:09,563 --> 01:04:12,325
Ah. You didn't call
just to apologize, did you?

1389
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:13,414
( laughing )

1390
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:15,750
What do you mean?

1391
01:04:15,828 --> 01:04:18,745
You... you...
you have no one else to call.

1392
01:04:18,825 --> 01:04:20,731
( laughing )

1393
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:23,337
Oh, ho, ho.

1394
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:25,827
( phone bell dings )

1395
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:27,346
( guffaws )

1396
01:04:27,425 --> 01:04:29,642
( humming )

1397
01:04:29,721 --> 01:04:31,860
~...Morn and night... ~

1398
01:04:33,846 --> 01:04:37,853
( melancholy melody playing )

1399
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:43,535
( melody fades )

1400
01:04:43,652 --> 01:04:45,130
You got that burger up?

1401
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,181
Yep.

1402
01:04:46,298 --> 01:04:49,060
( "He's So Fine"
playing on radio )

1403
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:51,005
-Hi.
-Hi!

1404
01:04:51,085 --> 01:04:52,290
How are you?

1405
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:54,003
~...Doo-lang, doo-lang,
doo-lang... ~

1406
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:55,793
~ The one
with the wavy hair... ~

1407
01:04:55,871 --> 01:04:57,193
More coffee, sir?

1408
01:05:03,655 --> 01:05:04,744
Are you a collector?

1409
01:05:04,822 --> 01:05:06,183
Of what?

1410
01:05:06,262 --> 01:05:08,246
"Captives of the Cosmic Ray,"
"The Big Freeze"

1411
01:05:08,285 --> 01:05:09,763
"Land of the Golden Giants."

1412
01:05:09,842 --> 01:05:10,775
I've got them all.

1413
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:13,187
What are you talking about?

1414
01:05:13,266 --> 01:05:15,172
Barry Allen.

1415
01:05:17,158 --> 01:05:18,597
The Flash.

1416
01:05:20,232 --> 01:05:22,098
Wait, kid, kid, kid.

1417
01:05:24,474 --> 01:05:25,718
You mean like the comic book?

1418
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:26,767
Yeah, the comic book.

1419
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:27,936
When he's not The Flash.

1420
01:05:28,014 --> 01:05:29,414
That's his name, Barry Allen.

1421
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:31,905
Thank you.

1422
01:05:36,031 --> 01:05:38,560
Now get this:
He reads comic books.

1423
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,245
Comic books!
Barry Allen is The Flash!

1424
01:05:41,323 --> 01:05:42,762
FOX:
Carl, slow down. Slow down.

1425
01:05:42,841 --> 01:05:44,008
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1426
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:45,642
He's a kid.
Our unsub is a kid.

1427
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,470
That's why we couldn't match
his prints.

1428
01:05:47,588 --> 01:05:49,182
That's why he doesn't have
a record.

1429
01:05:49,262 --> 01:05:50,662
Now, I want you to contact NYPD

1430
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,579
for every all-points juvenile
runaways in New York City.

1431
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:54,748
And don't forget the airports.

1432
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,732
He's been kiting checks
all over the country.

1433
01:05:56,811 --> 01:05:58,055
But why New York?

1434
01:05:58,134 --> 01:05:59,029
The Yankees!

1435
01:05:59,107 --> 01:06:01,636
He said something
about the Yankees!

1436
01:06:03,038 --> 01:06:05,605
HANRATTY:
So where are we on the list?

1437
01:06:05,684 --> 01:06:06,539
( rings doorbell )

1438
01:06:06,618 --> 01:06:08,562
FOX:
Number 53, "Abagnahlee."

1439
01:06:10,976 --> 01:06:12,103
HANRATTY:
Good morning, ma'am.

1440
01:06:12,144 --> 01:06:13,311
We're the FBI agents
who called.

1441
01:06:13,389 --> 01:06:14,828
Yes, I've been waiting.

1442
01:06:14,907 --> 01:06:16,657
I hope you're all hungry.

1443
01:06:16,735 --> 01:06:18,251
I put out the Sara Lee.

1444
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,467
My husband Jack is a lawyer.

1445
01:06:23,506 --> 01:06:26,385
What about your first husband,
Mrs. "Abagnahlee"?

1446
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:30,044
Abagnale, but I prefer
to be called Barnes.

1447
01:06:31,562 --> 01:06:33,352
"Frank William Abagnale."

1448
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:35,024
It says here
he was in the service.

1449
01:06:35,142 --> 01:06:37,008
Did... Did you two meet
during the war?

1450
01:06:37,049 --> 01:06:39,656
Yeah, I lived
in a very small village

1451
01:06:39,773 --> 01:06:42,924
in France-- Montrichard--
the kind of place

1452
01:06:43,002 --> 01:06:45,569
where they never heard
of Sara Lee.

1453
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,126
Help yourselves.

1454
01:06:47,205 --> 01:06:49,149
"Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee."

1455
01:06:49,229 --> 01:06:51,329
You filled out
a missing person's report

1456
01:06:51,447 --> 01:06:54,520
for a runaway juvenile by
the name of Frank Abagnale Jr.

1457
01:06:54,638 --> 01:06:56,077
Is Frankie okay?

1458
01:06:56,155 --> 01:06:58,255
You're aware of the fact
that he wrote some checks

1459
01:06:58,335 --> 01:07:00,163
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

1460
01:07:00,242 --> 01:07:01,642
Oh, yes.

1461
01:07:01,681 --> 01:07:04,170
The police think
he's some type of criminal.

1462
01:07:04,212 --> 01:07:06,701
What he did was a felony,
Mrs. Barnes.

1463
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:08,491
It was $1,000.

1464
01:07:08,569 --> 01:07:11,603
Half the kids his age are
on dope

1465
01:07:11,722 --> 01:07:14,133
throwing rocks at police

1466
01:07:14,212 --> 01:07:15,690
and they scared me to death

1467
01:07:15,807 --> 01:07:17,907
because my son made
a little mistake.

1468
01:07:17,948 --> 01:07:21,800
Huh. A 17-year-old...
boy has to eat

1469
01:07:21,878 --> 01:07:23,900
has to have a place to sleep.

1470
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,547
We understand, ma'am.

1471
01:07:26,665 --> 01:07:28,181
Would you happen to have
a picture of your son?

1472
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:30,167
Oh, yes.
I have his old yearbook.

1473
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:40,829
Okay.

1474
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:42,735
Okay, okay, we, uh...

1475
01:07:42,775 --> 01:07:45,692
we need to send out
an all-office teletype.

1476
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:49,040
Our unsub's name is
Frank Abagnale Jr., age 17.

1477
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,140
Is Frankie okay?
Is he in trouble?

1478
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,736
Ma'am, I'm sorry
to have to tell you:

1479
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:53,864
Your son is forging checks.

1480
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,616
Forging checks? Wait!

1481
01:07:55,695 --> 01:07:57,056
I'm sure we can take care
of that.

1482
01:07:57,135 --> 01:07:58,963
I am working part-time
at the church now.

1483
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,375
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.

1484
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:04,216
So far, it's about $1.3 million.

1485
01:08:09,743 --> 01:08:10,870
( timer dings )

1486
01:08:10,949 --> 01:08:12,739
~ Girl, you really
got me goin' ~

1487
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:15,813
~ You got me so
I don't know what I'm doin' ~

1488
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,019
( screaming and laughing )

1489
01:08:17,137 --> 01:08:18,576
~ Yeah, you really
got me goin' ~

1490
01:08:18,615 --> 01:08:20,521
~ You got me
so I can't sleep at night... ~

1491
01:08:20,561 --> 01:08:22,427
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

1492
01:08:22,468 --> 01:08:24,685
When you're in the house,
please, just use an ashtray.

1493
01:08:24,764 --> 01:08:26,670
Frank, this fondue is so good!

1494
01:08:26,748 --> 01:08:28,342
Great. Here, take this for me.

1495
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,860
Ooh, good! I love Moet!

1496
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,873
~ Oh, yeah... ~

1497
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:32,817
Hey. How are you?

1498
01:08:32,897 --> 01:08:34,297
~ You really got me goin' ~

1499
01:08:34,415 --> 01:08:36,321
~ You got me goin',
got me goin' and goin'... ~

1500
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:38,305
( music slows and distorts )

1501
01:08:38,884 --> 01:08:40,400
James, James, please!

1502
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:42,885
Just stay away from the
hi-fi system, all right?

1503
01:08:42,925 --> 01:08:43,858
It's reel-to-reel.

1504
01:08:43,898 --> 01:08:45,337
You can't wind it like that.

1505
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,320
~ Don't ever set me free... ~

1506
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,567
( drink sloshes )

1507
01:08:48,684 --> 01:08:50,706
Christ! Terry!

1508
01:08:50,824 --> 01:08:52,068
This is Italian knit!

1509
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:53,042
Watch where you're going!

1510
01:08:53,082 --> 01:08:54,443
It's just a shirt, man!

1511
01:08:54,482 --> 01:08:56,933
Frank! Come quick!

1512
01:08:57,013 --> 01:09:00,359
Lance just fell
into the conversation pit!

1513
01:09:06,846 --> 01:09:09,647
Excuse me, you know
where Lance Applebaum is?

1514
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:11,358
Thank you.

1515
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:13,883
DOCTOR:
These bottles need to be labeled
when you pick them up.

1516
01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:15,362
Do you understand
how dangerous this is?

1517
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,229
Do you?

1518
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,942
Don't stand there crying,
just nod your head

1519
01:09:18,058 --> 01:09:19,341
and tell me
you won't do it again.

1520
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,171
Now dry up and get back to work.

1521
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:23,700
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair

1522
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:24,868
Dr. Sherwood Blair.

1523
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:28,604
( gently ):
Hey, hey... you okay?

1524
01:09:28,644 --> 01:09:31,095
( sniffling ):
He told me to pick up the blood,

1525
01:09:31,173 --> 01:09:33,468
so I did, but he never told me
to label it.

1526
01:09:33,547 --> 01:09:35,453
Hey, it's okay.

1527
01:09:35,532 --> 01:09:37,632
Stop crying.

1528
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,656
What's your name?

1529
01:09:39,773 --> 01:09:42,340
-Brenda.
-Brenda.

1530
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:44,441
Brenda, I wouldn't worry
about it.

1531
01:09:44,521 --> 01:09:45,921
You know, these doctors

1532
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:48,256
you know,
they don't know everything.

1533
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:50,734
It's my first week

1534
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:53,453
and I think they're
going to fire me.

1535
01:09:53,454 --> 01:09:56,499
No, no, nobody's
going to fire you, Brenda.

1536
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,795
I bet you're good at your job.

1537
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,781
No, I'm not.

1538
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:04,088
Yeah, I bet if I asked you
to check on the status

1539
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,073
of my friend Lance Applebaum

1540
01:10:06,151 --> 01:10:08,562
that you could do that for me
in a second.

1541
01:10:08,642 --> 01:10:11,521
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

1542
01:10:11,599 --> 01:10:13,115
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

1543
01:10:13,896 --> 01:10:16,463
Um...

1544
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:19,420
Mr. Applebaum fractured
his ankle.

1545
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,728
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

1546
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:26,346
You see that? No problem.

1547
01:10:27,982 --> 01:10:30,433
This is the emergency chart.

1548
01:10:30,551 --> 01:10:31,951
See that blue star there?

1549
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:34,715
That means that the patient
has been diagnosed.

1550
01:10:34,753 --> 01:10:36,503
And then,
after he's been treated

1551
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:39,966
we put a red circle here, see?

1552
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:41,641
How do you like those braces?

1553
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:45,104
I guess they're all right.

1554
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:48,139
I got mine off last year.

1555
01:10:48,218 --> 01:10:50,785
Boy, I hated them.
They were bottoms.

1556
01:10:50,864 --> 01:10:54,015
You know, I still got to wear
my mouth guard.

1557
01:10:54,093 --> 01:10:56,193
You have really nice teeth.

1558
01:10:57,285 --> 01:10:59,307
Well, thank you.

1559
01:10:59,425 --> 01:11:02,537
And you have a pretty smile.

1560
01:11:02,616 --> 01:11:04,366
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Custodial to cafeteria.

1561
01:11:04,445 --> 01:11:05,572
( giggles )

1562
01:11:05,612 --> 01:11:06,701
No, I mean it.

1563
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,724
I really think
those braces look good on you.

1564
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:10,669
Thank you.

1565
01:11:10,749 --> 01:11:12,966
You're welcome.

1566
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:16,897
Brenda.

1567
01:11:16,975 --> 01:11:18,180
Yeah.

1568
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:21,099
Do you know if they're hiring
here at the hospital?

1569
01:11:22,463 --> 01:11:24,097
I'm not sure.

1570
01:11:24,175 --> 01:11:25,691
What do you want to do?

1571
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:29,465
I'm a doctor.

1572
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,553
FRANK:
Dear Dad:

1573
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:35,886
I've decided to get
off the road for awhile.

1574
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:38,222
I've taken a nightjob
at a hospital

1575
01:11:38,262 --> 01:11:39,896
and met
some really nice people.

1576
01:11:39,974 --> 01:11:42,036
Feels good to have my feet
on the ground

1577
01:11:42,114 --> 01:11:45,616
to wake up in the same bed
every night.

1578
01:11:45,694 --> 01:11:49,546
Who knows, maybe I'll even find
someone to settle down with.

1579
01:11:52,193 --> 01:11:54,137
Harvard Medical School...

1580
01:11:54,216 --> 01:11:56,433
top of your class.

1581
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,430
Southern California
Children's Hospital.

1582
01:11:59,509 --> 01:12:03,049
Well, that's a pretty impressive
resume, Dr. Conners

1583
01:12:03,128 --> 01:12:06,240
but unfortunately, uh...
the only thing I need

1584
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,587
is a...
an emergency room supervisor

1585
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:12,544
for my midnight to 8:00am shift

1586
01:12:12,623 --> 01:12:16,786
someone to baby-sit
six interns and 20 nurses

1587
01:12:16,904 --> 01:12:19,666
but, uh...

1588
01:12:19,745 --> 01:12:23,557
Hell, I doubt that, uh,
you would be interested in that.

1589
01:12:23,675 --> 01:12:26,048
Well, in the past

1590
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:30,018
they've always let me choose
my own nurses.

1591
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,703
Dr. Connelly?

1592
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:33,909
Dr. Harris?

1593
01:12:34,026 --> 01:12:35,075
Present.

1594
01:12:35,194 --> 01:12:36,750
Dr. Ashland?

1595
01:12:36,866 --> 01:12:38,382
Dr. Conners...

1596
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:40,679
You gonna take roll every night?

1597
01:12:40,758 --> 01:12:42,548
Uh, yes, I will, Dr. Ashland

1598
01:12:42,587 --> 01:12:46,361
and if you're going to be late,
I suggest you bring a note.

1599
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,513
( snickering )

1600
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,652
Miss Basmann.

1601
01:12:51,771 --> 01:12:53,365
Miss Mace.

1602
01:12:53,483 --> 01:12:54,999
Miss Strong.

1603
01:12:55,118 --> 01:12:56,440
Here.

1604
01:12:56,518 --> 01:12:58,462
Nurse Brown.

1605
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,526
-Nurse Sanford?
-Here.

1606
01:13:00,605 --> 01:13:02,099
SURGEON ( on TV ):
30 milligrams of codeine

1607
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:02,995
every four hours.

1608
01:13:03,073 --> 01:13:04,589
Run the plasma
at 60 drops a minute

1609
01:13:04,669 --> 01:13:06,575
until we calculate
the fluid requirements.

1610
01:13:06,653 --> 01:13:08,519
What do you estimate
the degree and extent

1611
01:13:08,599 --> 01:13:09,570
of the burns, Kildare?

1612
01:13:09,688 --> 01:13:11,244
DR. KILDARE:
Second and third-degree burns

1613
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:12,916
over about 20 percent
of the body surface.

1614
01:13:12,996 --> 01:13:13,891
Do you concur?

1615
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:14,864
I concur.

1616
01:13:14,903 --> 01:13:16,809
Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

1617
01:13:16,888 --> 01:13:20,272
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Nurse Hopp
to the Nurses' Station South.

1618
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:22,996
Nurse Hopp
to the Nurses' Station South.

1619
01:13:23,075 --> 01:13:24,436
Hello, Brenda.

1620
01:13:24,515 --> 01:13:25,759
Hi, Dr. Conners.

1621
01:13:25,838 --> 01:13:27,704
You need to sign these.

1622
01:13:27,784 --> 01:13:29,690
Thank you.

1623
01:13:35,372 --> 01:13:37,550
Do you notice anything
different about me, Doctor?

1624
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:39,380
-You got your braces off!
-Yeah!

1625
01:13:39,497 --> 01:13:40,546
Come here. Let me see.

1626
01:13:40,665 --> 01:13:42,337
I've been trying
to show you all night!

1627
01:13:42,455 --> 01:13:43,544
( thunder rumbling )

1628
01:13:43,622 --> 01:13:45,995
Wow. Good job.

1629
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:46,968
Yeah?

1630
01:13:47,086 --> 01:13:48,097
So, did it hurt
when they took them off?

1631
01:13:48,136 --> 01:13:49,536
Mine felt so weird after.

1632
01:13:49,615 --> 01:13:50,976
Mm, I keep rubbing my tongue
over them.

1633
01:13:51,054 --> 01:13:53,777
I can't stop.
They're so slippery.

1634
01:13:53,856 --> 01:13:55,217
It feels good, though,
doesn't it?

1635
01:13:55,257 --> 01:13:57,123
Yeah, it feels incredible.

1636
01:13:58,954 --> 01:14:00,938
( thunder rumbles )

1637
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,059
Oh, my.

1638
01:14:08,099 --> 01:14:10,472
I'm... I'm sorry.

1639
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:12,496
( thunder crashes )

1640
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:14,480
( passionate moaning )

1641
01:14:21,641 --> 01:14:23,780
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Dr. Conners to the ER.

1642
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,453
Dr. Conners to the ER.

1643
01:14:25,533 --> 01:14:26,622
Shouldn't you go?

1644
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,412
No. No, no.

1645
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:30,396
They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward.

1646
01:14:30,475 --> 01:14:32,381
We'll be fine.

1647
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,852
( panting ):
What if he's in surgery?

1648
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:42,926
Do you really think
I have to go?

1649
01:14:43,044 --> 01:14:45,533
Oh. In here, Dr. Conners.

1650
01:14:45,651 --> 01:14:47,557
( child sobbing )

1651
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:59,153
( sobbing )

1652
01:15:01,411 --> 01:15:05,263
Gentlemen, what, uh...
what seems to be the problem?

1653
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:06,625
Bicycle accident.

1654
01:15:06,704 --> 01:15:10,633
Fractured tibia about
five inches below the patella.

1655
01:15:10,712 --> 01:15:12,618
Hmm.

1656
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,094
-Dr. Harris.
-Yes?

1657
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:18,144
Do you concur?

1658
01:15:18,262 --> 01:15:21,530
C... Concur with what, sir?

1659
01:15:21,608 --> 01:15:23,474
With what Dr. Ashland just said.

1660
01:15:23,516 --> 01:15:26,045
Do you... Do you concur?

1661
01:15:26,123 --> 01:15:28,340
Uh... well, it was
a bicycle accident.

1662
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:30,245
Um, the boy told us.

1663
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:31,803
So you concur?

1664
01:15:31,882 --> 01:15:33,788
Concur? Uh...

1665
01:15:33,866 --> 01:15:35,033
I think we should take an X ray

1666
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:37,796
then stitch him up
and put him in a walking cast.

1667
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:38,963
( moans )

1668
01:15:41,027 --> 01:15:43,205
That's very good, Dr. Ashland.
Very good.

1669
01:15:43,244 --> 01:15:45,889
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

1670
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:47,525
Carry on.

1671
01:15:49,433 --> 01:15:52,000
I blew it, didn't I?

1672
01:15:52,078 --> 01:15:54,140
Why didn't I concur?

1673
01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:57,135
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Dr. Henning, call extension 219.

1674
01:15:57,176 --> 01:15:58,654
Dr. Henning, extension 219.

1675
01:15:58,733 --> 01:16:00,639
( vomiting )

1676
01:16:08,928 --> 01:16:12,235
( distant jackhammer drilling )

1677
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:16,594
FRANK SR.:
Make yourself at home!

1678
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,511
Frank Abagnale Sr.

1679
01:16:19,629 --> 01:16:21,963
You're not a cop.

1680
01:16:22,003 --> 01:16:25,699
Special Agent Hanratty, FBI.

1681
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:26,672
You're not a cop.

1682
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,124
My landlord said
you were not a cop.

1683
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:30,680
Well, if you're going
to arrest me

1684
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:32,315
I'd like
to put on a different suit

1685
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:33,482
if that's okay with you.

1686
01:16:33,561 --> 01:16:35,077
No, no, I'm not here
to arrest you.

1687
01:16:35,156 --> 01:16:37,100
I'm looking for your son.
He's in trouble.

1688
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:38,580
Do you know where he is?

1689
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,470
If I tell you where he is

1690
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,416
will you promise
not to tell his mother?

1691
01:16:44,496 --> 01:16:46,130
Sure.

1692
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:49,554
Frank made up a fake I.D.

1693
01:16:49,594 --> 01:16:50,916
and enlisted
in the Marine Corps.

1694
01:16:50,956 --> 01:16:52,317
He's over in Vietnam right now.

1695
01:16:52,435 --> 01:16:54,574
That kid is halfway
around the world

1696
01:16:54,692 --> 01:16:56,598
crawling through the damn jungle

1697
01:16:56,715 --> 01:16:59,049
fighting the Communists, so...

1698
01:16:59,127 --> 01:17:01,189
( shuts refrigerator door )

1699
01:17:01,229 --> 01:17:04,653
please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal

1700
01:17:04,731 --> 01:17:06,014
because that kid has
more guts...

1701
01:17:06,093 --> 01:17:07,921
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale.

1702
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:09,635
I said he was in trouble.

1703
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:12,980
If you'd like to give me a call
and talk, here's my number.

1704
01:17:23,566 --> 01:17:25,005
( pen scribbling )

1705
01:17:25,122 --> 01:17:26,794
You're not a father, are you?

1706
01:17:28,975 --> 01:17:31,270
Pardon me?

1707
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:32,671
If you were a father,
you'd know.

1708
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:36,057
I would never give up my son.

1709
01:17:36,096 --> 01:17:39,636
I would never give up my son.

1710
01:17:39,716 --> 01:17:42,984
Yes, sir. I understand.

1711
01:17:44,062 --> 01:17:46,124
Sean, Sean, now get this:

1712
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:47,563
"Riverbend Apartments

1713
01:17:47,642 --> 01:17:50,988
415 Landover, Atlanta, Georgia."

1714
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,427
Atlanta, Georgia.

1715
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:54,062
Yeah, I'm on my way
to the airport.

1716
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:56,552
I'll meet the team in, uh,
in four hours.

1717
01:17:56,632 --> 01:17:57,603
Bye-bye.

1718
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:01,262
Come on, it's okay.

1719
01:18:01,379 --> 01:18:02,818
( Brenda sobs )

1720
01:18:02,857 --> 01:18:04,685
You don't have to cry.

1721
01:18:04,765 --> 01:18:05,932
I'm sorry.

1722
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:07,721
I'm so sorry, Frank.

1723
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:09,161
I can't do this.

1724
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,613
Brenda, listen to me.

1725
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:13,947
I don't care if you're
a virgin, all right?

1726
01:18:13,987 --> 01:18:15,114
Really, I can wait.

1727
01:18:15,193 --> 01:18:18,188
I'm not a virgin.

1728
01:18:22,081 --> 01:18:24,610
I had an abortion two years ago.

1729
01:18:26,984 --> 01:18:31,186
My parents had a friend do it

1730
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:35,429
a man that my father
plays golf with.

1731
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:39,592
And then, when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.

1732
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,394
I had an abortion and I wasn't
their daughter anymore.

1733
01:18:42,473 --> 01:18:43,873
( gently ):
Hey...

1734
01:18:43,913 --> 01:18:44,846
I'm so sorry.

1735
01:18:44,924 --> 01:18:46,402
Please don't be mad at me.

1736
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,424
Please, please,
don't be mad at me.

1737
01:18:48,544 --> 01:18:49,555
No, no.

1738
01:18:49,633 --> 01:18:51,345
Please don't be mad at me.

1739
01:18:51,423 --> 01:18:53,173
Shh. Now... what if...

1740
01:18:53,252 --> 01:18:56,403
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?

1741
01:18:56,443 --> 01:18:58,309
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?

1742
01:18:58,389 --> 01:19:00,295
Well, I ask them all the time

1743
01:19:00,373 --> 01:19:02,862
but they said I still
can't come home.

1744
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:06,987
And my daddy's... a lawyer.

1745
01:19:07,105 --> 01:19:09,011
Aw...

1746
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:17,456
Brenda...

1747
01:19:17,535 --> 01:19:20,419
what if you were engaged
to a doctor?

1748
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,326
Will that change anything?

1749
01:19:22,366 --> 01:19:23,882
What?

1750
01:19:27,192 --> 01:19:31,004
What if I went
to your parents...

1751
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,105
and I spoke to your father...

1752
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:39,643
and I asked permission
to marry you?

1753

1754

( woman laughs )

1759
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:20,709
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

1760
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:25,963
Yes, I-I am a Lutheran,
but, please, call me Frank.

1761
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:28,530
Frank, would you like
to say grace?

1762
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,897
Unless you're not comfortable.

1763
01:20:36,977 --> 01:20:38,921
Absolutely.

1764
01:20:40,673 --> 01:20:42,579
( clears throat )

1765
01:20:48,222 --> 01:20:51,606
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1766
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:55,421
The first mouse quickly
gave up and drowned

1767
01:20:55,538 --> 01:20:57,638
but the second mouse,
he struggled so hard

1768
01:20:57,718 --> 01:21:00,169
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter

1769
01:21:00,286 --> 01:21:02,192
and he walked out.

1770
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:06,278
-Amen.
-Amen.

1771
01:21:06,318 --> 01:21:09,197
Amen. Oh, that was beautiful.

1772
01:21:09,237 --> 01:21:11,766
The mouse, he churned
that cream into butter.

1773
01:21:11,883 --> 01:21:14,334
( sighing happily )

1774
01:21:14,451 --> 01:21:15,346
That's right.

1775
01:21:15,424 --> 01:21:16,668
That's pretty good.

1776
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,381
Thank you.

1777
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:20,093
Frank, have you decided
which hospital

1778
01:21:20,133 --> 01:21:21,883
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?

1779
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:24,062
Well, um, to be quite honest

1780
01:21:24,102 --> 01:21:27,214
I'm thinking
about getting back into law.

1781
01:21:27,254 --> 01:21:28,966
Oh, my!

1782
01:21:29,044 --> 01:21:31,106
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1783
01:21:31,224 --> 01:21:34,920
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

1784
01:21:34,998 --> 01:21:36,437
I practiced law for one year

1785
01:21:36,554 --> 01:21:40,561
then I decided why not
try my hand at pediatrics?

1786
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:43,247
You're just full of surprises.

1787
01:21:43,364 --> 01:21:45,036
Yeah.

1788
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:46,594
MOTHER ( laughing ):
Oh, my.

1789
01:21:46,711 --> 01:21:48,150
A doctor and a lawyer.

1790
01:21:48,189 --> 01:21:49,589
Well, I'd say that Brenda
hit the jackpot.

1791
01:21:49,669 --> 01:21:52,508
Where did you go to law school?

1792
01:21:52,548 --> 01:21:54,182
Uh, Berkeley.

1793
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:55,115
( gasping )

1794
01:21:55,195 --> 01:21:56,517
Berkley, Berkley. Oh, my gosh.

1795
01:21:56,596 --> 01:21:58,035
Isn't that where you went,
Daddy?

1796
01:21:58,114 --> 01:21:59,942
Maybe Frank could come work
for you, Roger.

1797
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,654
You're always saying
how hard it is

1798
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:03,210
to find
Assistant Prosecutors.

1799
01:22:03,288 --> 01:22:05,350
Could he, Daddy?
Could he, please?

1800
01:22:05,468 --> 01:22:06,868
Could he come work with you,
please?

1801
01:22:06,946 --> 01:22:08,852
Was that snake Hollingsworth
still teaching there

1802
01:22:08,932 --> 01:22:10,137
when you went through Berkley?

1803
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:11,810
( laughs quietly )

1804
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:13,289
Hollingsworth.

1805
01:22:13,367 --> 01:22:16,324
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth,
right?

1806
01:22:16,442 --> 01:22:17,881
I tell you. Meaner than ever.

1807
01:22:17,998 --> 01:22:19,904
And that dog of his?

1808
01:22:22,435 --> 01:22:26,520
Tell me, Frank, what was
the name of his little dog?

1809
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:38,156
I'm sorry. Uh...

1810
01:22:38,273 --> 01:22:40,063
The dog was dead.

1811
01:22:40,141 --> 01:22:41,541
( women cooing )

1812
01:22:41,619 --> 01:22:45,043
How unfortunate.

1813
01:22:45,122 --> 01:22:47,028
Yeah.

1814
01:23:16,564 --> 01:23:19,249
A doctor, a lawyer,
a Lutheran...

1815
01:23:21,974 --> 01:23:24,853
So what are you, Frank?

1816
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:26,565
'Cause I think you're
about to ask

1817
01:23:26,643 --> 01:23:28,393
for my daughter's hand
in marriage

1818
01:23:28,433 --> 01:23:29,872
and I have a right to know.

1819
01:23:29,912 --> 01:23:32,090
Know what, sir?

1820
01:23:32,169 --> 01:23:34,814
The truth.

1821
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:39,095
Tell me the truth, Frank.

1822
01:23:39,173 --> 01:23:42,791
What are you doing here?

1823
01:23:42,871 --> 01:23:45,905
What is a man like you doing
with Brenda?

1824
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:47,968
If you want my blessing

1825
01:23:48,047 --> 01:23:50,109
if you want my daughter

1826
01:23:50,148 --> 01:23:53,027
I'd like to hear it
from you now.

1827
01:23:55,868 --> 01:23:57,774
The truth is, sir, that...

1828
01:24:01,355 --> 01:24:02,794
The truth is that...

1829
01:24:05,012 --> 01:24:08,358
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a lawyer...

1830
01:24:10,694 --> 01:24:13,261
I'm not an airline pilot.

1831
01:24:13,379 --> 01:24:16,218
I'm... I'm nothing, really.

1832
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,714
I'm-I'm-I'm just a kid who's
in love with your daughter.

1833
01:24:28,907 --> 01:24:31,163
No.

1834
01:24:38,752 --> 01:24:41,008
You know what you are?

1835
01:24:41,086 --> 01:24:42,992
You're a romantic.

1836
01:24:43,071 --> 01:24:45,910
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

1837
01:24:46,028 --> 01:24:49,530
I must confess, I'm guilty
of the same foolish whimsy.

1838
01:24:49,608 --> 01:24:51,670
I proposed to Carol
after five dates

1839
01:24:51,749 --> 01:24:54,628
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

1840
01:24:54,707 --> 01:24:56,691
because I knew she was the one.

1841
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:59,493
So go ahead, Frank.

1842
01:25:02,528 --> 01:25:04,434
Don't be afraid.

1843
01:25:04,513 --> 01:25:08,093
Ask the question you came here
to ask me.

1844
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,411
Sir, uh, uh...

1845
01:25:12,491 --> 01:25:13,930
w-what would I have to do

1846
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:16,497
to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

1847
01:25:16,616 --> 01:25:18,482
( laughing )

1848
01:25:21,129 --> 01:25:24,436
No, the... the other question.

1849
01:25:24,515 --> 01:25:27,861
( ticking )

1850
01:25:27,939 --> 01:25:31,713
WOMAN:
Right through that door.

1851
01:25:31,831 --> 01:25:34,516
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

1852
01:25:34,633 --> 01:25:36,267
Thank you.

1853
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,982
Hey, Frank...

1854
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:47,162
you know what I could
never figure out?

1855
01:25:47,241 --> 01:25:49,848
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

1856
01:25:49,926 --> 01:25:51,676
Why? What's the difference?

1857
01:25:51,716 --> 01:25:53,972
Someone else took the test
for you, didn't they?

1858
01:25:54,052 --> 01:25:56,659
Carl, I'm going to prison
for a long time.

1859
01:25:56,737 --> 01:25:59,382
Seriously,
what's the difference?

1860
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,638
It's a simple question.

1861
01:26:01,678 --> 01:26:04,012
Are you going to eat
that eclair?

1862
01:26:06,582 --> 01:26:10,044
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

1863
01:26:10,162 --> 01:26:11,874
Well, you want
to split it with me?

1864
01:26:11,912 --> 01:26:15,336
No.

1865
01:26:15,376 --> 01:26:18,722
Give me half that eclair
and I'll tell you.

1866
01:26:28,102 --> 01:26:32,304
I'm going to figure it out
sooner or later.

1867
01:26:38,686 --> 01:26:42,032
You'll be working under
Phillip Rigby in corporate law.

1868
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:45,029
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

1869
01:26:47,247 --> 01:26:48,647
Thank you.

1870
01:26:48,726 --> 01:26:51,411
We're having lunch at 12:30
with the Attorney General

1871
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:53,395
and Governor McKeithen.

1872
01:26:53,473 --> 01:26:54,678
Himself.

1873
01:26:54,758 --> 01:26:56,002
The Governor.

1874
01:26:56,081 --> 01:26:57,170
Did we spell it right?

1875
01:26:57,287 --> 01:26:58,765
You sure did.

1876
01:26:58,844 --> 01:27:00,556
Congratulations.

1877
01:27:00,634 --> 01:27:01,761
Thank you, sir.

1878
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,045
Welcome aboard.

1879
01:27:03,124 --> 01:27:05,030
Now...

1880
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:12,879
Look at this photograph,
Mr. Stewart.

1881
01:27:12,957 --> 01:27:15,991
It's a photograph
of Prentice York

1882
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:18,015
where they found him, dead.

1883
01:27:18,095 --> 01:27:21,246
Now, here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

1884
01:27:21,324 --> 01:27:23,735
This is a photograph
of the defendant's signature

1885
01:27:23,815 --> 01:27:25,215
on a canceled check.

1886
01:27:25,293 --> 01:27:27,704
Now, here is an enlargement
of that same signature

1887
01:27:27,823 --> 01:27:28,872
which matches

1888
01:27:28,991 --> 01:27:31,830
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon

1889
01:27:31,948 --> 01:27:33,620
which discuss the possibility

1890
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:35,877
of defrauding
the great State of Louisiana.

1891
01:27:35,957 --> 01:27:39,108
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury

1892
01:27:39,186 --> 01:27:40,742
this is irrefutable evidence

1893
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:44,010
that the defendant is,
in fact, lying.

1894
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:45,684
( echoing thud )

1895
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,592
( chair slams against floor )

1896
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:54,245
Mr. Conners, this is
a preliminary hearing.

1897
01:27:54,246 --> 01:27:57,708
There is no... defendant.

1898
01:27:57,787 --> 01:28:02,222
There is no... jury.

1899
01:28:02,301 --> 01:28:05,180
It's just me.

1900
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,736
Son...

1901
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:11,056
what in the hell is wrong
with you?!

1902
01:28:12,596 --> 01:28:14,424
-( applause over TV )
-Is that Mitch?

1903
01:28:14,503 --> 01:28:16,175
Roger! It's Mitch!

1904
01:28:16,793 --> 01:28:18,737
Oh, my,
I lost all track of time.

1905
01:28:18,855 --> 01:28:21,150
MITCH MILLER ( on TV ):
As studio guests
for the sing-along tonight

1906
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:23,407
we have the children's choir
of St. Monica's Church

1907
01:28:23,486 --> 01:28:24,837
in New York City.

1908
01:28:24,838 --> 01:28:26,510
Won't you join them and the gang

1909
01:28:26,588 --> 01:28:28,688
in a few songs for the Irish?
Everybody!

1910
01:28:28,768 --> 01:28:31,297
~ Has anybody here seen Kelly? ~

1911
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:34,137
( all but Frank joining in ):
~ K, E, double L, Y ~

1912
01:28:34,216 --> 01:28:36,550
~ Has anybody here seen Kelly? ~

1913
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:38,611
~ Have you seen him smile? ~

1914
01:28:38,729 --> 01:28:41,180
~ Sure his hair is red,
and his eyes are blue ~

1915
01:28:41,259 --> 01:28:43,748
~ And he's Irish
through and through ~

1916
01:28:43,827 --> 01:28:46,200
~ Has anybody here seen Kelly ~

1917
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,652
~ Kelly from the Emerald Isle? ~

1918
01:28:48,731 --> 01:28:51,260
~ Has anybody here seen Kelly? ~

1919
01:28:51,377 --> 01:28:53,439
~ K, E, double L, Y ~

1920
01:28:53,556 --> 01:28:56,163
(joining in ):
~ Has anybody here seen Kelly? ~

1921
01:28:56,241 --> 01:28:58,303
~ Have you seen him smile? ~

1922
01:28:58,343 --> 01:29:00,988
~ Sure his hair is red,
and his eyes are blue ~

1923
01:29:01,028 --> 01:29:03,362
~ And he's Irish
through and through ~

1924
01:29:03,441 --> 01:29:05,736
~ Has anybody here
seen Kelly... ~

1925
01:29:05,814 --> 01:29:07,992
JUDY GARLAND ( on record ):
~ Embrace me ~

1926
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:13,363
~ My sweet embraceable you ~

1927
01:29:13,442 --> 01:29:16,515
~ Embrace me ~

1928
01:29:16,594 --> 01:29:22,781
~ You irreplaceable you ~

1929
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:25,738
~ Just one look at you ~

1930
01:29:25,855 --> 01:29:31,613
~ My heart grew tipsy in me ~

1931
01:29:31,653 --> 01:29:34,376
~ You and you alone ~

1932
01:29:34,455 --> 01:29:40,758
~ Bring out the gypsy in me ~

1933
01:29:41,031 --> 01:29:43,754
~ I love all ~

1934
01:29:43,834 --> 01:29:50,137
~ The many charms about you ~

1935
01:29:50,215 --> 01:29:52,977
~ Above all ~

1936
01:29:53,095 --> 01:29:56,441
~ I want my arms about you... ~

1937
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,687
( whispers ):
Dad.

1938
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:02,317
~...Don't be
a naughty baby... ~

1939
01:30:02,357 --> 01:30:04,301
What are you doing here?

1940
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:08,121
I... I-I came to see you.

1941
01:30:08,122 --> 01:30:11,079
~...My sweet embraceable... ~

1942
01:30:11,196 --> 01:30:13,218
What are you doing
dressed like this?

1943
01:30:13,336 --> 01:30:15,126
I took a job. A government job.

1944
01:30:15,204 --> 01:30:16,565
You see what I'm doing?

1945
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,278
Do you have a good lawyer?

1946
01:30:18,356 --> 01:30:20,729
Well... I sort of
am a lawyer now.

1947
01:30:20,808 --> 01:30:24,465
Look at this letter.
The IRS wants more.

1948
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:26,917
I had a deal with them:
two penalties.

1949
01:30:26,995 --> 01:30:30,185
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

1950
01:30:30,264 --> 01:30:32,987
I want to sue them.

1951
01:30:33,444 --> 01:30:36,245
Now they want the crumbs.

1952
01:30:36,285 --> 01:30:38,307
They... Here, sit down.

1953
01:30:38,348 --> 01:30:40,837
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me.

1954
01:30:40,916 --> 01:30:43,367
You know what?

1955
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:46,753
You know what?
I'll make them chase me...

1956
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:49,126
for the rest of their lives.

1957
01:30:55,042 --> 01:30:58,660
Hey, it's great
to see you, Daddy.

1958
01:30:58,738 --> 01:31:03,017
Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.

1959
01:31:04,731 --> 01:31:06,987
I came here to give you this.

1960
01:31:06,989 --> 01:31:11,074
It's an invitation
to an engagement party.

1961
01:31:12,203 --> 01:31:14,926
Daddy, I'm getting married.

1962
01:31:15,005 --> 01:31:17,844
Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.

1963
01:31:17,885 --> 01:31:20,336
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad.

1964
01:31:20,492 --> 01:31:22,554
Listen, I'm getting
a brand-new Cadillac.

1965
01:31:22,593 --> 01:31:24,383
I'm getting a $60,000 house.

1966
01:31:24,423 --> 01:31:26,329
I'm-I'm getting it all back.

1967
01:31:26,369 --> 01:31:28,703
All-All the jewelry,
all the furs, everything, Dad.

1968
01:31:28,742 --> 01:31:31,349
Everything they took from us,
I'm going to get it back.

1969
01:31:31,427 --> 01:31:33,217
Now...

1970
01:31:33,295 --> 01:31:36,875
has Ma seen you
dressed like this?

1971
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:40,076
Yeah, she came
to pick up some boxes.

1972
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:41,633
That's okay, that's okay,
you know why?

1973
01:31:41,712 --> 01:31:43,656
'Cause she... she's going
to the wedding with us.

1974
01:31:43,697 --> 01:31:45,487
I'm going to get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1975
01:31:45,565 --> 01:31:46,832
I'm getting you
a brand-new suit.

1976
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:48,895
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button, black pearl suits.

1977
01:31:48,933 --> 01:31:49,866
You'll look great.

1978
01:31:49,984 --> 01:31:51,345
Those are nice. Yeah.

1979
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,913
She won't see me.

1980
01:31:54,966 --> 01:31:56,716
Well, have you tried
to call her?

1981
01:31:56,794 --> 01:31:58,856
Uh-uh.

1982
01:31:58,934 --> 01:32:01,385
Why don't... why don't you
call her right now?

1983
01:32:01,464 --> 01:32:03,837
Dad, why don't you
call her right now? Here.

1984
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:06,327
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.

1985
01:32:06,406 --> 01:32:07,962
You call her, and you tell her

1986
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:10,724
I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

1987
01:32:10,764 --> 01:32:13,215
Your mother's married now,
to my friend Jack Barnes.

1988
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:16,211
They have a house
in Long Island.

1989
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:19,908
( whispering ):
I had an FBI agent come see me.

1990
01:32:20,026 --> 01:32:21,698
You got their number, son.

1991
01:32:21,816 --> 01:32:23,800
The guy looked scared.

1992
01:32:23,918 --> 01:32:28,120
The United States government,
champ, running for the hills.

1993
01:32:28,237 --> 01:32:30,376
Pow! To the moon!

1994
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:44,113
Dad... it's over.

1995
01:32:45,554 --> 01:32:47,420
I'm going to stop now.

1996
01:32:47,499 --> 01:32:49,521
But y-you've...

1997
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:51,663
They're never going
to catch you, Frank.

1998
01:32:51,741 --> 01:32:53,803
-Dad, she wouldn't do that.
-Why won't you sit down?

1999
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,748
-Why would she do that to you?
-Come on, sit.

2000
01:32:55,866 --> 01:32:57,382
Come on, sit with me.
Have a drink.

2001
01:32:57,462 --> 01:32:58,706
I'm your father.

2002
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:02,092
Then ask me to stop.

2003
01:33:02,171 --> 01:33:04,310
( quietly ):
Then ask me to stop.

2004
01:33:07,191 --> 01:33:09,097
You can't stop.

2005
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:12,909
Where are you going?

2006
01:33:12,989 --> 01:33:15,245
Come on, Frank,
where are you going?

2007
01:33:15,324 --> 01:33:16,607
Where are you going?

2008
01:33:16,685 --> 01:33:18,551
Where are you going tonight?

2009
01:33:18,631 --> 01:33:19,758
Someplace exotic?

2010
01:33:19,837 --> 01:33:21,081
Where are you going tonight?

2011
01:33:21,161 --> 01:33:22,250
Tahiti, Hawall?

2012
01:33:32,018 --> 01:33:35,870
( phone ringing )

2013
01:33:39,645 --> 01:33:42,407
This is Hanratty.

2014
01:33:42,447 --> 01:33:44,391
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

2015
01:33:44,509 --> 01:33:46,337
Merry Christmas.

2016
01:33:46,455 --> 01:33:48,672
How are you, Dr. Conners?

2017
01:33:48,712 --> 01:33:53,031
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

2018
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:54,860
( Hanratty sniffles,
clears throat )

2019
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:59,647
Well... I'm sitting here
in my office on Christmas Eve.

2020
01:33:59,725 --> 01:34:01,203
What do you want?

2021
01:34:01,243 --> 01:34:05,445
( instrumental version "I'll Be
Home for Christmas" playing )

2022
01:34:05,523 --> 01:34:08,130
( sighs ):
Okay.

2023
01:34:12,411 --> 01:34:14,511
I want it to be over.

2024
01:34:17,704 --> 01:34:21,421
Uh... I want it to be over.
I'm getting married.

2025
01:34:22,161 --> 01:34:24,027
You know, I'm settling down.

2026
01:34:24,066 --> 01:34:25,971
You've stolen almost $4 million.

2027
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,302
You think we can just
call that a wedding present?

2028
01:34:28,342 --> 01:34:31,219
Nah, this isn't something you
get to walk away from, Frank.

2029
01:34:31,297 --> 01:34:32,696
I want to call a truce.

2030
01:34:32,774 --> 01:34:33,784
No truce.

2031
01:34:33,941 --> 01:34:35,768
You will be caught,
you will go to prison.

2032
01:34:35,807 --> 01:34:37,362
Where did you think
this was going?

2033
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,666
Please leave me alone, Carl.

2034
01:34:40,744 --> 01:34:42,026
Please?

2035
01:34:42,066 --> 01:34:43,854
I'm getting close, aren't I?

2036
01:34:43,894 --> 01:34:45,915
You're scared because
I'm getting close.

2037
01:34:46,032 --> 01:34:49,103
I know you... you rented
that car in Shreveport

2038
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:52,058
and you stayed in that hotel
on Lake Charles.

2039
01:34:52,136 --> 01:34:54,041
You want to run, be my guest.

2040
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,334
Your checks don't lie
as well as you do.

2041
01:34:56,374 --> 01:34:59,289
Stop chasing me.

2042
01:35:01,428 --> 01:35:03,955
I can't stop.

2043
01:35:04,111 --> 01:35:06,521
It's my job.

2044
01:35:06,599 --> 01:35:08,970
It's okay, Carl.

2045
01:35:09,048 --> 01:35:12,352
I just thought I'd ask,
you know?

2046
01:35:14,763 --> 01:35:18,650
Hey. Merry Christmas, huh?

2047
01:35:18,768 --> 01:35:21,761
( click and dial tone )

2048
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,210
I love my job.

2049
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:25,766
All right... ( clears throat )

2050
01:35:27,244 --> 01:35:28,643
let's get every newspaper
we can

2051
01:35:28,682 --> 01:35:30,969
every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

2052
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:32,214
What are we looking for?

2053
01:35:32,253 --> 01:35:34,507
Engagement announcements,
name of Conners.

2054
01:35:34,586 --> 01:35:36,879
Conners?! Come on, Carl,
the kid would've

2055
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:38,357
changed his name by now.

2056
01:35:38,474 --> 01:35:41,078
Mm-mm. He can't change it.

2057
01:35:41,157 --> 01:35:42,906
She thinks he's Conners.

2058
01:35:42,984 --> 01:35:45,122
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.

2059
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,716
~ I can't give you anything ~

2060
01:35:46,911 --> 01:35:50,487
~ But love, baby ~

2061
01:35:50,565 --> 01:35:54,219
~ That's the only thing
I have plenty of ~

2062
01:35:54,298 --> 01:35:55,269
~ Baby ~

2063
01:35:55,425 --> 01:35:56,980
~ Dreamin' a while,
schemin' a while... ~

2064
01:35:57,019 --> 01:35:58,535
-Congratulations.
-You having a good time?

2065
01:35:58,613 --> 01:36:01,878
~...You're sure to find ~

2066
01:36:01,957 --> 01:36:04,367
-~ Happiness, and I guess ~
-Keep dancing, huh?

2067
01:36:04,445 --> 01:36:06,388
~ All those things
you've always pined for... ~

2068
01:36:06,505 --> 01:36:08,371
-Oh.
-Hi.

2069
01:36:08,488 --> 01:36:09,343
Oh, me too. Thank you.

2070
01:36:09,499 --> 01:36:11,209
I'm going to, uh,
the llttle boys' room.

2071
01:36:11,287 --> 01:36:12,375
-Okay.
-Okay.

2072
01:36:12,493 --> 01:36:13,892
Hurry back.

2073
01:36:19,646 --> 01:36:22,600
( car approaching )

2074
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:25,594
( brakes squeaking )

2075
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:29,093
Good evening.

2076
01:36:29,211 --> 01:36:31,038
I'm Agent Hanratty
with the FBI.

2077
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:32,982
We'd like to have
a few quiet words

2078
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,342
with your host, if possible.

2079
01:36:34,381 --> 01:36:36,324
MAN:
I'll get him.

2080
01:36:37,453 --> 01:36:38,813
Right over there, sir.

2081
01:36:38,852 --> 01:36:41,301
-Hi, Roger. How are you?
-Hi, Vin.

2082
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,673
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

2083
01:36:43,712 --> 01:36:45,111
Carl Hanratty, FBI.

2084
01:36:45,229 --> 01:36:47,328
This is Agents Amdursky and Fox.

2085
01:36:47,406 --> 01:36:49,427
Sorry to crash your party, sir.

2086
01:36:49,505 --> 01:36:51,371
Not at all.
What can I do for you?

2087
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:54,675
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.

2088
01:36:54,715 --> 01:36:57,630
Is there a problem?

2089
01:36:57,709 --> 01:36:59,303
-( laughter )
-Frank! Frank!

2090
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:00,935
Can you hold all these?

2091
01:37:01,013 --> 01:37:01,984
( whispering ):
Yeah. Come here.

2092
01:37:02,102 --> 01:37:04,279
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

2093
01:37:04,357 --> 01:37:06,495
They're for us, so we can
start a new life... Hey!

2094
01:37:06,534 --> 01:37:08,050
What are you doing?
What's wrong?

2095
01:37:08,128 --> 01:37:09,760
We have to leave.

2096
01:37:09,839 --> 01:37:11,549
What?!

2097
01:37:11,705 --> 01:37:14,543
Brenda, you love me, right?

2098
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:15,515
Yes.

2099
01:37:15,593 --> 01:37:16,564
I mean, you'd love me
no matter what.

2100
01:37:16,681 --> 01:37:17,575
Yes.

2101
01:37:17,653 --> 01:37:18,586
I mean, you'd love me

2102
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:20,063
whether I was sick
or whether I was poor

2103
01:37:20,141 --> 01:37:21,462
or even if I had
a different name.

2104
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:22,940
Frank, where'd you get
all that money?

2105
01:37:23,019 --> 01:37:24,613
Brenda, listen. A name, right?

2106
01:37:24,690 --> 01:37:25,778
A name, it doesn't matter.

2107
01:37:25,818 --> 01:37:26,984
My name is Frank Conners, right?

2108
01:37:27,062 --> 01:37:28,267
-That's who I am with you.
-Yes.

2109
01:37:28,345 --> 01:37:29,472
But-but we all have secrets.

2110
01:37:29,628 --> 01:37:30,949
You know,
sometimes when I travel

2111
01:37:31,066 --> 01:37:33,204
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.

2112
01:37:33,244 --> 01:37:35,187
-Frank Taylor?!
-Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?

2113
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:36,353
-Frank Black.
-Frank Black?!

2114
01:37:36,432 --> 01:37:37,520
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2115
01:37:37,598 --> 01:37:40,125
Why are you saying all this?

2116
01:37:40,203 --> 01:37:42,846
Brenda... Brenda, I don't want
to lie to you anymore.

2117
01:37:42,924 --> 01:37:44,362
All right? I'm not a doctor.

2118
01:37:44,402 --> 01:37:46,034
I never went to medical school.

2119
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:48,716
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.

2120
01:37:48,795 --> 01:37:51,205
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago

2121
01:37:51,322 --> 01:37:53,110
when I was 16.

2122
01:37:53,149 --> 01:37:55,792
Frank...

2123
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:58,009
Frank?

2124
01:37:58,087 --> 01:37:59,992
You're not a Lutheran?

2125
01:38:00,031 --> 01:38:02,441
Brenda... you see
all this money?

2126
01:38:02,519 --> 01:38:04,424
You see all this money?
I have more.

2127
01:38:04,502 --> 01:38:06,951
I have plenty more.

2128
01:38:07,068 --> 01:38:08,039
I have enough money

2129
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:09,828
to last us
for the rest of our lives

2130
01:38:09,945 --> 01:38:11,266
-( gasps )
-Look.

2131
01:38:11,345 --> 01:38:13,910
Frank, stop teasing me.

2132
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:15,154
You're Frank Conners.

2133
01:38:15,232 --> 01:38:18,070
You're Frank Conners,
and you're 28 years old and...

2134
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:19,392
( whispering ):
Brenda...

2135
01:38:19,509 --> 01:38:21,414
Why would you lie to me?

2136
01:38:21,531 --> 01:38:23,630
-Brenda, Brenda...
-I want to know your name.

2137
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:25,651
-Listen to me, Brenda.
-Tell me your name.

2138
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:27,051
We can live anywhere we want

2139
01:38:27,129 --> 01:38:28,606
but you have to trust me,
Brenda.

2140
01:38:28,646 --> 01:38:29,928
-Do you trust me?
-Yes.

2141
01:38:30,006 --> 01:38:31,949
-Do you love me, Brenda?
-Yes.

2142
01:38:32,028 --> 01:38:33,349
-You love me?
-I love you.

2143
01:38:33,467 --> 01:38:35,838
Excuse me, Mother.

2144
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:38,209
Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty.
My wife Carol.

2145
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,230
-Oh, Mister...?
-Hanratty, ma'am.

2146
01:38:40,309 --> 01:38:41,280
-Ratty.
-Yes.

2147
01:38:41,281 --> 01:38:42,680
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

2148
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,702
I-I think they went upstairs.

2149
01:38:50,107 --> 01:38:51,662
Frank...

2150
01:38:53,411 --> 01:38:55,277
( whispers ):
Brenda, come here.

2151
01:38:55,355 --> 01:38:57,260
Okay, in two days,
you're going to meet me

2152
01:38:57,299 --> 01:38:59,320
at Miami International
Airport, all right?

2153
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:01,848
You're going to leave the house
after your parents go to sleep.

2154
01:39:01,965 --> 01:39:03,092
You're going to take a taxicab.

2155
01:39:03,131 --> 01:39:04,763
You give the taxi driver
this money right here

2156
01:39:04,919 --> 01:39:06,590
and you tell him to drive
all through the night.

2157
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:08,457
Brenda, you're going
to leave at 10:00am.

2158
01:39:08,535 --> 01:39:10,245
-10:00am, all right?
-But...

2159
01:39:10,362 --> 01:39:12,539
( scatting )

2160
01:39:12,578 --> 01:39:14,716
~ I never stop ~

2161
01:39:14,794 --> 01:39:17,709
~ Till I get to the top... ~

2162
01:39:17,788 --> 01:39:20,937
(jazz continues in distance )

2163
01:39:28,791 --> 01:39:30,229
Which room, sir?

2164
01:39:30,346 --> 01:39:31,590
In the corner.

2165
01:39:31,668 --> 01:39:32,834
You have to listen to me,
all right?

2166
01:39:32,912 --> 01:39:34,817
The International Terminal
in Miami, all right? Say it.

2167
01:39:34,895 --> 01:39:36,333
Okay, the International
Terminal in Miami.

2168
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:37,694
-No matter what...
-No matter what...

2169
01:39:37,772 --> 01:39:39,677
-You're going to take a taxicab.
-I will take a taxi.

2170
01:39:39,755 --> 01:39:41,232
You're going to be there
at 10:00am.

2171
01:39:41,349 --> 01:39:42,476
I will be there at 10:00am,
no matter what.

2172
01:39:42,554 --> 01:39:43,487
-In two days.
-Two days.

2173
01:39:43,526 --> 01:39:44,459
Two days, Brenda. Two days.

2174
01:39:44,498 --> 01:39:45,936
In two days, I'll be there

2175
01:39:45,975 --> 01:39:47,491
no matter what, at 10:00am.

2176
01:39:53,217 --> 01:39:54,655
You're not going
to tell anyone, Brenda.

2177
01:39:54,773 --> 01:39:55,783
You have to promise me, now.

2178
01:39:55,939 --> 01:39:57,144
( crying ):
Frank, please!

2179
01:39:57,222 --> 01:39:59,476
Before you go,
please tell me your name.

2180
01:39:59,516 --> 01:40:01,809
Please, tell me.

2181
01:40:01,848 --> 01:40:06,280
Frank William Abagnale Jr.

2182
01:40:08,263 --> 01:40:10,556
( ominous music playing )

2183
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:16,428
( light, childlike theme plays )

2184
01:40:19,266 --> 01:40:20,860
( wind blowing )

2185
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:27,664
( ominous theme building )

2186
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:30,229
( childlike theme returns )

2187
01:40:32,563 --> 01:40:35,440
( shuddering )

2188
01:40:44,187 --> 01:40:46,130
~ ~

2189
01:40:52,002 --> 01:40:53,984
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
National Airlines

2190
01:40:54,062 --> 01:40:56,705
flight number 27, serving
Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa

2191
01:40:56,784 --> 01:41:00,244
and New York Kennedy,

Skycap, Gate 14.
Skycap, Gate 14.

2193
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:07,902
Taxi!

2194
01:41:07,942 --> 01:41:10,857
( announcements continue
indistinctly over P.A. )

2195
01:41:17,934 --> 01:41:20,150
MAN ( over P.A. ):
Your attention...

2196
01:41:29,286 --> 01:41:31,851
~ ~

2197
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:43,905

2200
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,997
( sighing )

2201
01:42:14,075 --> 01:42:16,796
Brenda.

2202
01:42:29,965 --> 01:42:30,859
AMDURSKY:
This guy's a no-show.

2203
01:42:31,015 --> 01:42:31,948
He must've got wise to us.
HANRATTY: Maybe he was tipped.

2204
01:42:32,036 --> 01:42:33,046
If he's not here today,
he'll be tomorrow.

2205
01:42:33,086 --> 01:42:34,524
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

2206
01:42:35,114 --> 01:42:36,435
He doesn't have a passport.

2207
01:42:36,513 --> 01:42:38,884
For the last six months, he's
gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

2208
01:42:38,963 --> 01:42:40,284
I'm betting he can get
a passport.

2209
01:42:40,362 --> 01:42:42,033
So we have all our men
waiting for him here

2210
01:42:42,151 --> 01:42:43,006
in Miami International.

2211
01:42:43,123 --> 01:42:44,755
He's used it before.
He knows the layout.

2212
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:46,660
I talked to Miami police;
they've offered us

2213
01:42:46,699 --> 01:42:48,254
50 uniformed cops
in two shifts of 25.

2214
01:42:48,332 --> 01:42:50,392
With our guys, that's almost
100 men in one airport.

2215
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:52,142
Don't you think
we should spread it around?

2216
01:42:52,259 --> 01:42:53,736
No, no, this is the exit point.

2217
01:42:53,892 --> 01:42:55,991
Well, how do you know
he hasn't rented a car

2218
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:58,168
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

2219
01:42:58,285 --> 01:42:59,684
Because I'm not in New York.

2220
01:42:59,724 --> 01:43:00,890
I'm not in Atlanta.

2221
01:43:00,929 --> 01:43:02,756
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts

2222
01:43:02,795 --> 01:43:04,777
and I'm letting
all the universities

2223
01:43:04,856 --> 01:43:07,577
in the area know
that Pan Am will be initiating

2224
01:43:07,655 --> 01:43:09,560
a new recruiting program
this year.

2225
01:43:09,638 --> 01:43:12,748
I'll, uh, be stopping
by your campus tomorrow morning.

2226
01:43:12,865 --> 01:43:15,780
Thank you all very much
for coming.

2227
01:43:15,897 --> 01:43:16,946
At the end of the day

2228
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:20,057
I'll be choosing eight
young ladies to be a part of...

2229
01:43:20,135 --> 01:43:21,651
( cheering and laughter )

2230
01:43:21,729 --> 01:43:24,411
...Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

2231
01:43:24,489 --> 01:43:26,938
Now, these eight young ladies
will accompany me

2232
01:43:27,055 --> 01:43:29,932
on a two-month public relations
tour through Europe.

2233
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:31,254
( women squealing )

2234
01:43:31,332 --> 01:43:33,897
They will discover first hand
what it takes

2235
01:43:33,898 --> 01:43:35,880
to be a Pan American stewardess.

2236
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:37,747
( cheering )

2237
01:43:37,786 --> 01:43:40,274
HANRATTY:
Give me at least two men...

2238
01:43:40,391 --> 01:43:42,762
Nah, one man
per every two counters.

2239
01:43:42,918 --> 01:43:44,200
-Mm-hmm.
-All right?

2240
01:43:44,279 --> 01:43:45,678
Amdursky?

2241
01:43:45,717 --> 01:43:47,622
Yeah?

2242
01:43:47,661 --> 01:43:49,760
Make sure your uniforms
are covering

2243
01:43:49,838 --> 01:43:51,743
the sidewalk entrances
and exits.

2244
01:43:51,821 --> 01:43:55,747
Hey... let's have, uh, periodic
sweeps of the men's lav.

2245
01:43:55,787 --> 01:43:57,458
You, here.

2246
01:43:57,575 --> 01:44:01,229
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

2247
01:44:01,346 --> 01:44:04,261
Well, I think
that I'm really friendly

2248
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:05,972
and I can really help out

2249
01:44:06,012 --> 01:44:08,927
and, um, make people
feel welcome on the plane and...

2250
01:44:09,005 --> 01:44:11,454
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour

2251
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:13,126
at an altitude of 300 feet.

2252
01:44:13,243 --> 01:44:18,141
~ All my bags are packed,
I'm ready to go... ~

2253
01:44:18,259 --> 01:44:20,475
( playing dramatic piano intro )

2254
01:44:20,552 --> 01:44:21,873
liene Anderson.

2255
01:44:21,913 --> 01:44:24,012
( squealing and applause )

2256
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:29,105
( pianist playing
"Come Fly With Me" )

2257
01:44:29,183 --> 01:44:31,282
Miggy Acker.

2258
01:44:31,399 --> 01:44:33,809
( excited squealing )

2259
01:44:35,521 --> 01:44:37,931
Debra Jo McMillan.

2260
01:44:43,646 --> 01:44:45,745
Candy Heston.

2261
01:44:45,823 --> 01:44:53,404
FRANK SINATRA:
~ Come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away ~

2262
01:44:53,483 --> 01:44:56,476
~ If you can use
some exotic booze ~

2263
01:44:56,515 --> 01:44:59,936
~ There's a bar in far Bombay ~

2264
01:45:00,014 --> 01:45:07,245
~ Come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away ~

2265
01:45:07,362 --> 01:45:11,522
~ Come fly with me,
let's float down to Peru ~

2266
01:45:13,894 --> 01:45:16,848
~ In Ilama land
there's a one-man band ~

2267
01:45:16,926 --> 01:45:19,841
~ And he'll toot his flute
for you ~

2268
01:45:19,959 --> 01:45:21,747
( appreciative whistle )

2269
01:45:21,786 --> 01:45:22,796
~ Come fly with me... ~

2270
01:45:22,914 --> 01:45:23,963
Hi.

2271
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,529
~...Let's take off
in the blue ~

2272
01:45:26,607 --> 01:45:29,950
~ Once I get you up there ~

2273
01:45:30,028 --> 01:45:32,127
~ Where the air is rarefied ~

2274
01:45:32,244 --> 01:45:34,421
( wolf whistle )

2275
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:40,370
~ We'll just glide starry-eyed ~

2276
01:45:40,526 --> 01:45:43,325
~ Once I get you up there... ~

2277
01:45:43,403 --> 01:45:44,763
You see that blonde out front?

2278
01:45:44,802 --> 01:45:45,929
I should have been a pilot.

2279
01:45:46,008 --> 01:45:47,679
Exactly.

2280
01:45:47,796 --> 01:45:49,078
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Mr. Carl Hanratty

2281
01:45:49,157 --> 01:45:50,517
please pick up
the courtesy telephone.

2282
01:45:50,634 --> 01:45:51,761
Hanratty.

2283
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:53,860
AMDURSKY:
Carl, your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.

2284
01:45:53,939 --> 01:45:55,338
There's a guy
in a Pan Am uniform

2285
01:45:55,377 --> 01:45:57,904
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
out in front of Terminal J.

2286
01:45:58,021 --> 01:45:59,070
That's the charter terminal.

2287
01:45:59,148 --> 01:46:00,314
Can you get a look at his face?

2288
01:46:00,431 --> 01:46:01,519
He's got his pilot's cap on.

2289
01:46:01,598 --> 01:46:02,686
Carl, I think it's him!

2290
01:46:02,764 --> 01:46:04,902
~...Just say the words,
and we'll beat the birds ~

2291
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:06,340
~ Down to Acapulco Bay... ~

2292
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:07,702
( siren blaring )

2293
01:46:07,818 --> 01:46:09,217
Watch out, watch out,
watch out!

2294
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:12,950
~...It's perfect for a flying
honeymoon, they say... ~

2295
01:46:13,067 --> 01:46:14,816
( agents shouting )

2296
01:46:14,855 --> 01:46:16,254
Out of the car, Frank.

2297
01:46:16,294 --> 01:46:17,810
( patrol cars' tires squealing )

2298
01:46:17,849 --> 01:46:18,820
Frank?!

2299
01:46:18,899 --> 01:46:20,920
Step out of the car!

2300
01:46:20,998 --> 01:46:23,136
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

2301
01:46:23,292 --> 01:46:24,886
Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.

2302
01:46:24,964 --> 01:46:26,907
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

2303
01:46:27,024 --> 01:46:28,034
and pick someone up
at the airport.

2304
01:46:28,191 --> 01:46:29,085
Who you picking up?

2305
01:46:30,174 --> 01:46:31,301
Hey!

2306
01:46:34,761 --> 01:46:39,815
~ Pack up, let's fly away. ~

2307
01:46:42,576 --> 01:46:45,141
( engine roaring )

2308
01:46:54,745 --> 01:46:56,688
HANRATTY:
South America, Australia

2309
01:46:56,805 --> 01:46:58,165
Singapore, Egypt.

2310
01:46:58,283 --> 01:47:00,499
The kid's gone
completely out of control.

2311
01:47:00,577 --> 01:47:01,498
Why wasn't I called?

2312
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:02,225
FOX:
Nobody was called, sir.

2313
01:47:02,226 --> 01:47:03,858
The banks didn't know what
was happening till last week.

2314
01:47:03,937 --> 01:47:04,986
That's impossible.

2315
01:47:05,064 --> 01:47:06,735
They didn't call
'cause it's not counterfeiting.

2316
01:47:06,814 --> 01:47:08,330
-It's something else.
-Well, what is he doing?

2317
01:47:08,408 --> 01:47:09,418
He's making real checks, sir.

2318
01:47:09,496 --> 01:47:10,429
These are so perfect

2319
01:47:10,507 --> 01:47:11,945
the airline didn't know
the difference.

2320
01:47:12,101 --> 01:47:13,733
Last check was cashed
in Madrid a week ago.

2321
01:47:13,812 --> 01:47:14,939
My guess is he's still there.

2322
01:47:15,056 --> 01:47:16,300
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.

2323
01:47:16,339 --> 01:47:17,621
Go where?

2324
01:47:17,622 --> 01:47:19,138
Spain? You want to go to Spain?

2325
01:47:19,255 --> 01:47:20,771
Well, eventually,
he's got to go back

2326
01:47:20,849 --> 01:47:21,820
to where the checks
were printed.

2327
01:47:21,899 --> 01:47:23,298
I think that's why
he's moving back through Europe.

2328
01:47:23,376 --> 01:47:24,413
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

2329
01:47:24,414 --> 01:47:25,372
He's running out of checks.

2330
01:47:25,403 --> 01:47:26,880
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir

2331
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:30,696
but if we track him from Madrid,
sir, we could still catch him.

2332
01:47:30,824 --> 01:47:32,612
I'm sorry, Carl,
if you couldn't catch him here

2333
01:47:32,651 --> 01:47:33,972
you're not going
to catch him there.

2334
01:47:34,012 --> 01:47:35,800
But, sir, we're going
to let him get away.

2335
01:47:35,878 --> 01:47:39,338
No, Carl, you let him get away.

2336
01:47:48,669 --> 01:47:51,546
( tapping map )

2337
01:48:01,227 --> 01:48:04,104
~ ~

2338
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:15,807
~ ~

2339
01:48:20,845 --> 01:48:26,404
A perfect one-16th
all the way around.

2340
01:48:26,443 --> 01:48:27,959
Hmm!

2341
01:48:28,037 --> 01:48:30,719
Color separation is flawless.

2342
01:48:32,897 --> 01:48:34,918
There's no bleeding. Hmm.

2343
01:48:35,074 --> 01:48:37,562
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

2344
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:38,884
Nobody but us.

2345
01:48:38,962 --> 01:48:40,311
HANRATTY:
Where was it printed?

2346
01:48:40,312 --> 01:48:42,528
( chuckling ):
It was printed on a monster...

2347
01:48:42,606 --> 01:48:43,500
A monster.

2348
01:48:43,577 --> 01:48:44,976
...a Heidelberg, an Istra...

2349
01:48:45,055 --> 01:48:46,065
Heidelberg.

2350
01:48:46,143 --> 01:48:47,737
...a dinosaur, four colors.

2351
01:48:47,815 --> 01:48:49,214
You can smell the weight.

2352
01:48:49,332 --> 01:48:50,809
Two tons, without the ink.

2353
01:48:50,887 --> 01:48:52,325
( inhales, clears throat )

2354
01:48:52,364 --> 01:48:54,269
Where do they do printing
like this?

2355
01:48:54,347 --> 01:48:55,824
Germany, Great Britain...

2356
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:56,835
France.

2357
01:48:56,874 --> 01:48:59,517
BOTH PRINTERS:
France!

2358
01:48:59,557 --> 01:49:01,617
France. Frank's mother said
the name of a village in France

2359
01:49:01,656 --> 01:49:02,822
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

2360
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:04,377
The village where
she met Frank's father.

2361
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:05,815
Oh, yeah,
I don't remember, uh...

2362
01:49:05,894 --> 01:49:08,382
It started with an M.
It was, uh, "Mont" something.

2363
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:10,326
"Mont." Mr. Fox?

2364
01:49:10,404 --> 01:49:11,298
Uh, yes, yes.

2365
01:49:11,376 --> 01:49:12,581
Question: "You met your husband
during the war?"

2366
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:14,719
Answer: "Yes, I lived
in a small village in France.

2367
01:49:14,797 --> 01:49:15,730
Yeah, right.

2368
01:49:15,769 --> 01:49:17,168
"The kind of place where
they never heard of Sara Lee."

2369
01:49:17,441 --> 01:49:19,346
Tell me you wrote down the name
of the village, Mr. Fox.

2370
01:49:20,862 --> 01:49:22,456
Montrichard.

2371
01:49:22,534 --> 01:49:26,888
CHORUS ( in distance ):
~ Laeti triumphantes ~

2372
01:49:27,005 --> 01:49:31,320
~ Venite, venite ~

2373
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:36,840
~ In Bethlehem ~

2374
01:49:36,919 --> 01:49:41,351
~ Natum videte ~

2375
01:49:41,429 --> 01:49:46,249
~ Regem angelorum ~

2376
01:49:46,289 --> 01:49:56,125
~ Venite adoremus,
Venite adoremus ~

2377
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,379
~ Venite... ~

2378
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:01,179
( rhythmic clattering )

2379
01:50:12,882 --> 01:50:14,009
( bell ringing )

2380
01:50:14,048 --> 01:50:15,564
( thumping and fluttering )

2381
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,847
( clattering slows )

2382
01:50:16,925 --> 01:50:17,858
Carl?

2383
01:50:17,897 --> 01:50:18,907
Carl!

2384
01:50:20,424 --> 01:50:21,784
Merry Christmas!

2385
01:50:21,863 --> 01:50:25,245
How is it that we're always
talking on Christmas, Carl?

2386
01:50:25,323 --> 01:50:27,111
Every Christmas
I'm talking to you!

2387
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:28,083
( laughing )

2388
01:50:28,161 --> 01:50:30,066
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

2389
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,671
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?

2390
01:50:32,787 --> 01:50:34,264
They got the best
French beans here.

2391
01:50:34,343 --> 01:50:35,392
Here, give these a try.

2392
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:37,025
There's two dozen French
police officers outside.

2393
01:50:37,103 --> 01:50:38,308
Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.

2394
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:39,396
They wanted to bring you in.

2395
01:50:39,436 --> 01:50:40,407
You want a bite?

2396
01:50:40,485 --> 01:50:41,418
But they needed the help
of an American.

2397
01:50:41,496 --> 01:50:42,662
Are you hungry?
You want a bite?

2398
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:43,984
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you

2399
01:50:44,101 --> 01:50:45,617
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

2400
01:50:45,734 --> 01:50:47,172
Well, you have a gun?
You have a gun?

2401
01:50:47,289 --> 01:50:48,299
-No gun?
-No.

2402
01:50:48,417 --> 01:50:49,350
No gun.

2403
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:52,731
And-and you're...
and you're telling me what?

2404
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:54,131
There's, uh,
there's uh... ( chuckles )

2405
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:56,464
there's two dozen
French police officers out there

2406
01:50:56,542 --> 01:50:57,513
right now on Christmas Eve?

2407
01:50:57,592 --> 01:50:58,680
That's what you're telling me?

2408
01:50:58,720 --> 01:50:59,964
Yeah.

2409
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:01,323
( chuckling ):
All right, all right.

2410
01:51:01,402 --> 01:51:02,529
Well, there's no windows here.

2411
01:51:02,607 --> 01:51:05,056
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

2412
01:51:05,096 --> 01:51:06,145
No! No!

2413
01:51:06,223 --> 01:51:08,788
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal.

2414
01:51:08,906 --> 01:51:10,266
Here, you can
put these on yourself.

2415
01:51:10,344 --> 01:51:11,821
No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.

2416
01:51:11,899 --> 01:51:12,948
You know why?

2417
01:51:13,027 --> 01:51:14,076
( panting )

2418
01:51:14,154 --> 01:51:15,514
'Cause I think
you're full of shit.

2419
01:51:15,632 --> 01:51:18,003
I don't... I don't think
there's anyone else out there.

2420
01:51:18,081 --> 01:51:19,869
I think... I think
it's just me and you.

2421
01:51:19,947 --> 01:51:21,113
That's right.

2422
01:51:21,191 --> 01:51:23,057
I think it's just me and you,
and you know what?

2423
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:24,806
You're going to have
to catch me yourself!

2424
01:51:24,885 --> 01:51:27,412
I wo... we don't have time
for this.

2425
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:29,589
Ah, that's good. That's good.

2426
01:51:29,667 --> 01:51:32,271
Tell me what you want me to see,
huh?

2427
01:51:32,388 --> 01:51:33,321
I wouldn't lie to you.

2428
01:51:33,438 --> 01:51:34,798
Look, you're wearing
a wedding ring.

2429
01:51:34,877 --> 01:51:36,354
You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!

2430
01:51:36,432 --> 01:51:37,442
You lied to me about that!

2431
01:51:37,559 --> 01:51:38,880
Didn't you lie about that?!

2432
01:51:38,881 --> 01:51:40,513
You asked me if I had a family.

2433
01:51:40,592 --> 01:51:42,069
I did, but I don't anymore.

2434
01:51:42,108 --> 01:51:43,974
( phone ringing )

2435
01:51:44,013 --> 01:51:46,345
( anxious breathing )

2436
01:51:48,562 --> 01:51:50,583
( ringing continues )

2437
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:53,343
Yes? No, no, no,
there is no problem.

2438
01:51:53,383 --> 01:51:54,743
We're coming out right now.

2439
01:51:54,860 --> 01:51:55,909
( laughing )

2440
01:51:55,988 --> 01:51:57,620
Whoa, that was good.
That was good.

2441
01:51:57,698 --> 01:52:00,030
What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk

2442
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:01,625
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?

2443
01:52:01,703 --> 01:52:02,597
It was Captain Luc.

2444
01:52:02,675 --> 01:52:04,307
I've got one minute
to bring you out.

2445
01:52:04,385 --> 01:52:05,823
Captain Luc? Captain Luc!

2446
01:52:05,902 --> 01:52:06,912
Ooh, Captain Luc.

2447
01:52:07,029 --> 01:52:08,000
Well, Carl, I gotta say

2448
01:52:08,118 --> 01:52:09,556
that-that sounds
pretty official to me

2449
01:52:09,595 --> 01:52:11,655
but like I said, I...
I think it's just

2450
01:52:11,695 --> 01:52:13,444
me and you here,
it's me and you.

2451
01:52:13,483 --> 01:52:14,571
So you're going to have
to catch me.

2452
01:52:14,611 --> 01:52:15,660
Frank. Frank!

2453
01:52:15,738 --> 01:52:17,215
You have to trust me on this!

2454
01:52:17,293 --> 01:52:19,936
These people
have been embarrassed, Frank.

2455
01:52:20,015 --> 01:52:21,064
They're angry.

2456
01:52:21,181 --> 01:52:22,775
You rob their banks,
you steal their money

2457
01:52:22,892 --> 01:52:23,863
you live in their country.

2458
01:52:23,941 --> 01:52:25,690
I told you this was
what was going to happen

2459
01:52:25,769 --> 01:52:27,401
that there was no other way
for it to end.

2460
01:52:27,479 --> 01:52:30,161
Don't make a mistake!

2461
01:52:30,201 --> 01:52:31,250
That's good.

2462
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:33,582
That's good, Carl, you know?

2463
01:52:33,661 --> 01:52:34,555
Keep pushing that lie.

2464
01:52:34,633 --> 01:52:35,527
Keep pushing it.

2465
01:52:35,605 --> 01:52:37,121
Keep pushing
till you make it true.

2466
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:39,648
They're going to kill you!

2467
01:52:39,765 --> 01:52:42,253
You walk out that door,
they're going to kill you.

2468
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:44,275
( panting )

2469
01:52:47,113 --> 01:52:49,251
Is that the truth?

2470
01:52:52,673 --> 01:52:54,966
Yeah.

2471
01:52:58,738 --> 01:53:01,265
You have any children, Carl?

2472
01:53:01,304 --> 01:53:04,919
I have a four-year-old daughter.

2473
01:53:04,997 --> 01:53:07,485
You swear on your daughter?

2474
01:53:09,468 --> 01:53:11,878
You swear?

2475
01:53:15,883 --> 01:53:19,071
You swear?

2476
01:53:19,188 --> 01:53:21,248
( handcuffs clacking )

2477
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:33,495
CHORUS:
~ Redit ce chant melodieux ~

2478
01:53:33,612 --> 01:53:41,309
~ Gloria ~

2479
01:53:41,426 --> 01:53:44,925
~ In excelsius Deo ~

2480
01:53:45,003 --> 01:53:47,957
~ Gloria... ~

2481
01:53:48,036 --> 01:53:50,057
That was really good, Carl.

2482
01:53:50,135 --> 01:53:52,856
( car approaching )

2483
01:53:52,935 --> 01:53:54,801
( sirens blaring )

2484
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,822
( chorus continues singing )

2485
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,144
( tires screeching )

2486
01:53:58,261 --> 01:53:59,466
( officer shouting in French )

2487
01:53:59,544 --> 01:54:00,477
I have him in custody.

2488
01:54:00,516 --> 01:54:01,604
I got him.

2489
01:54:01,682 --> 01:54:03,314
I got him! It's all right!

2490
01:54:03,393 --> 01:54:04,637
( shouting continues )

2491
01:54:04,715 --> 01:54:05,725
It's all right!

2492
01:54:05,881 --> 01:54:07,475
I got him!

2493
01:54:07,553 --> 01:54:08,524
( speaking in French )

2494
01:54:08,603 --> 01:54:10,313
( officer shouting excitedly )

2495
01:54:10,391 --> 01:54:12,762
Hey, I want it...
I want it on the record.

2496
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:15,328
Frank Abagnale surrendered
of his own accord.

2497
01:54:15,445 --> 01:54:17,777
Understood? Understood?

2498
01:54:17,856 --> 01:54:18,750
Where are you taking him?

2499
01:54:18,828 --> 01:54:19,722
( speaking in French )

2500
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:20,655
I'm... I'm supposed to go.

2501
01:54:20,733 --> 01:54:22,404
Where are you taking him?

2502
01:54:22,443 --> 01:54:23,648
Let me in the...

2503
01:54:23,726 --> 01:54:24,620
Let me in the car!

2504
01:54:24,698 --> 01:54:25,669
( shouting continues )

2505
01:54:25,748 --> 01:54:27,808
Hey! Let me in the car!

2506
01:54:27,886 --> 01:54:28,974
~ Gloria... ~

2507
01:54:29,053 --> 01:54:30,141
( engine starts )

2508
01:54:30,258 --> 01:54:31,346
Don't worry, Frank!

2509
01:54:31,424 --> 01:54:33,367
I'll have you extradited
back to the United States.

2510
01:54:33,485 --> 01:54:34,418
Don't worry.

2511
01:54:34,573 --> 01:54:36,983
( siren wailing )

2512
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:47,481
~ Gloria ~

2513
01:54:49,658 --> 01:54:54,245
~ In excelsius Deo. ~

2514
01:54:54,285 --> 01:54:57,084
Carl...

2515
01:54:57,162 --> 01:55:00,077
Carl, you have to remember

2516
01:55:00,156 --> 01:55:03,188
to let me call my father
when we land.

2517
01:55:03,305 --> 01:55:05,132
I just want to,
I want to talk to him

2518
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:08,087
before he sees me on television
or something like that.

2519
01:55:17,729 --> 01:55:19,284
Carl, look.

2520
01:55:19,323 --> 01:55:21,266
That's LaGuardia right there.

2521
01:55:21,344 --> 01:55:23,015
Runway 4-4.

2522
01:55:23,094 --> 01:55:25,582
Frank, your father is dead.

2523
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:27,565
I'm sorry.

2524
01:55:27,604 --> 01:55:31,064
I didn't want to say anything
till we got closer to home.

2525
01:55:31,142 --> 01:55:35,729
He-He... He fell down some steps
at Grand Central Station

2526
01:55:35,807 --> 01:55:37,750
trying to catch a train.

2527
01:55:37,829 --> 01:55:40,006
I didn't want to be the one
to tell you.

2528
01:55:40,123 --> 01:55:43,311
You're lying, right?

2529
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:45,527
You said I could talk to him.

2530
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:47,199
Carl, who are you to...

2531
01:55:47,238 --> 01:55:49,104
who are you to say
something like that, huh?

2532
01:55:49,182 --> 01:55:50,892
Who are you
to say something like that?

2533
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:51,980
You said I could talk to him.

2534
01:55:52,097 --> 01:55:53,768
He fell, and he...
and he broke his neck.

2535
01:55:53,886 --> 01:55:54,896
I'm sorry.

2536
01:55:56,141 --> 01:55:57,190
I'm really sorry.

2537
01:56:05,044 --> 01:56:07,921
( panting )

2538
01:56:07,999 --> 01:56:09,281
( hits seat )

2539
01:56:09,398 --> 01:56:10,875
( sobbing ):
Goddamn it!

2540
01:56:10,992 --> 01:56:13,441
Carl, I'm going to be sick!

2541
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:14,453
-( people muttering )
-It's all right.

2542
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:15,424
It's all right. It's okay.

2543
01:56:15,541 --> 01:56:16,785
Carl, I got to go
to the bathroom.

2544
01:56:16,863 --> 01:56:17,757
I'm going to be sick.

2545
01:56:17,835 --> 01:56:19,545
Sure.
Let's go in the bathroom.

2546
01:56:20,945 --> 01:56:22,888
( panting )

2547
01:56:26,466 --> 01:56:27,710
Goddamn it!

2548
01:56:27,788 --> 01:56:31,636
( sobbing )

2549
01:56:31,715 --> 01:56:33,153
( pounding )

2550
01:56:33,231 --> 01:56:34,591
( murmuring )

2551
01:56:34,631 --> 01:56:37,080
( panting )

2552
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:39,101
( panting slows )

2553
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:42,367
( Frank panting )

2554
01:56:44,856 --> 01:56:47,733
( whispering ):
Oh, Daddy...

2555
01:56:50,338 --> 01:56:51,737
You'll have take your seat, sir.

2556
01:56:51,815 --> 01:56:53,331
I've told you twice.
We're landing.

2557
01:56:53,409 --> 01:56:54,730
-Sorry. Thank you...
-All of you.

2558
01:56:54,809 --> 01:56:55,936
Frank! Come on now.

2559
01:56:56,053 --> 01:56:58,035
-Frank?
-We're landing in six minutes.

2560
01:56:58,113 --> 01:56:59,162
All of you need to be
in your seats

2561
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,340
-with your seat belts fastened.
-Frank, open the door!

2562
01:57:01,379 --> 01:57:02,934
Frank!

2563
01:57:04,762 --> 01:57:06,317
-You do it.
-Yeah.

2564
01:57:18,252 --> 01:57:20,701
( engines decelerating )

2565
01:57:27,117 --> 01:57:29,449
( grunting )

2566
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:33,415
( frustrated sigh )

2567
01:57:33,532 --> 01:57:34,853
( grunting )

2568
01:57:34,931 --> 01:57:36,797
Frank! Frank!

2569
01:57:36,836 --> 01:57:38,779
( engines roaring )

2570
01:57:38,858 --> 01:57:40,996
( tires squealing )

2571
01:57:41,074 --> 01:57:43,562
HANRATTY:
All right, remain seated,
everyone, please.

2572
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,234
FBI. Stay seated.
FBI. Stay seated.

2573
01:57:45,351 --> 01:57:48,266
( engines whining )

2574
01:57:53,515 --> 01:57:54,836
-Please remain seated!
-Stay seated.

2575
01:57:54,915 --> 01:57:56,159
STEWARDESS:
You must stay seated

2576
01:57:56,198 --> 01:57:58,647
until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.

2577
01:57:58,686 --> 01:58:00,202
HANRATTY:
God almighty.

2578
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:03,856
NAT KING COLE:
~ Chestnuts roasting
on an open fire... ~

2579
01:58:04,013 --> 01:58:06,851
( panting )

2580
01:58:06,928 --> 01:58:13,887
~ Jack Frost nipping
at your nose ~

2581
01:58:13,927 --> 01:58:19,097
~ Yuletide carols
being sung by a choir ~

2582
01:58:19,175 --> 01:58:24,695
~ And folks dressed up
like Eskimos ~

2583
01:58:24,735 --> 01:58:27,612
~ Everybody knows ~

2584
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:32,705
~ A turkey and some mistletoe ~

2585
01:58:32,744 --> 01:58:37,253
~ Help to make
the season bright ~

2586
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:39,547
( quietly blowing notes )

2587
01:58:39,548 --> 01:58:43,824
~ Tiny tots with their eyes
all aglow ~

2588
01:58:43,902 --> 01:58:47,750
~ Will find it hard
to sleep tonight... ~

2589
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:49,695
What's your name?

2590
01:58:49,773 --> 01:58:50,706
( blows note )

2591
01:58:50,822 --> 01:58:52,765
~ They know that Santa's
on his way... ~

2592
01:58:52,883 --> 01:58:56,187
Where's your mommy?

2593
01:58:56,304 --> 01:59:00,775
~...He's loaded lots of toys
and goodies on his sleigh ~

2594
01:59:00,853 --> 01:59:03,652
( blows note )

2595
01:59:03,691 --> 01:59:08,900
~ And every mother's child
is gonna spy ~

2596
01:59:08,979 --> 01:59:11,428
~ To see if reindeer
really know how to fly... ~

2597
01:59:11,506 --> 01:59:14,421
( brakes squeaking )

2598
01:59:14,499 --> 01:59:19,436
~ And so I'm offering
this simple phrase... ~

2599
01:59:19,515 --> 01:59:22,508
( men shouting indistinctly )

2600
01:59:22,586 --> 01:59:28,845
~ To kids from one to 92 ~

2601

~ Although it's been said
many times ~

2602
01:59:32,228 --> 01:59:35,571
~ Many ways:
"Merry Christmas..." ~

2603
01:59:35,649 --> 01:59:37,243
Hands behind your head!

2604
01:59:37,321 --> 01:59:39,226
~...To you. ~

2605
01:59:39,304 --> 01:59:40,625
Carl, get me in the car,
please.

2606
01:59:40,704 --> 01:59:43,658
Get me in the car.

2607
01:59:43,775 --> 01:59:45,641
HANRATTY:
Put him in.

2608
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:48,557
( piano playing interlude
in "The Christmas Song" )

~ ~

2611
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:04,730
JUDGE:
Taking into account
the gravity of these crimes

2612
02:00:04,808 --> 02:00:08,501
your history of bold
and elusive behavior

2613
02:00:08,580 --> 02:00:10,873
and your complete lack
of respect

2614
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:13,244
for the laws
of the United States

2615
02:00:13,323 --> 02:00:16,316
I have no choice
but to ignore your request

2616
02:00:16,394 --> 02:00:18,260
to be treated as a minor

2617
02:00:18,299 --> 02:00:20,087
and sentence you to 12 years

2618
02:00:20,127 --> 02:00:23,237
in Atlanta's
maximum security prison

2619
02:00:23,315 --> 02:00:26,503
and recommend strongly
that you be kept in isolation

2620
02:00:26,541 --> 02:00:28,523
for the entirety
of that sentence.

2621
02:00:28,641 --> 02:00:32,023
~..."Merry Christmas to you." ~

2622
02:00:32,101 --> 02:00:35,444
( song ends with guitar playing
"Jingle Bells" riff )

2623
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:42,481
Use that door over there.

2624
02:00:42,598 --> 02:00:44,930
( phone ringing )

2625
02:00:45,009 --> 02:00:47,924
( indistinct voices )

2626
02:00:48,041 --> 02:00:49,907
PRISONER:
...and give everyone my love.

2627
02:00:49,946 --> 02:00:51,578
I think about them all the time.

2628
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:03,981
( indistinct conversations
in distance )

2629
02:01:07,836 --> 02:01:09,080
( sighs deeply )

2630
02:01:09,158 --> 02:01:11,451
Merry Christmas, Frank.

2631
02:01:13,746 --> 02:01:16,311
Hey, I got you
some comic books here.

2632
02:01:22,443 --> 02:01:23,687
How's your daughter?

2633
02:01:23,765 --> 02:01:24,892
What was her name?

2634
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:25,864
Grace.

2635
02:01:25,942 --> 02:01:27,963
Well... I don't know.

2636
02:01:28,003 --> 02:01:29,324
She lives with her mother
in Chicago

2637
02:01:29,402 --> 02:01:31,268
and I don't get to see her much.

2638
02:01:32,785 --> 02:01:34,301
What's in the briefcase?

2639
02:01:34,418 --> 02:01:36,634
Oh. I'm on my way
to the airport.

2640
02:01:36,712 --> 02:01:38,966
It's a paperhanger

2641
02:01:39,005 --> 02:01:40,365
who's working his way
through Minnesota.

2642
02:01:40,366 --> 02:01:41,726
( chuckling )

2643
02:01:41,766 --> 02:01:45,148
Aw, geez, he's...
he's driving us crazy.

2644
02:01:45,226 --> 02:01:46,742
You got any of the checks?

2645
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:49,191
Yeah, yeah, I got a...
a counterfeit that he drew

2646
02:01:49,269 --> 02:01:51,018
on the Great Lakes
Savings and Loan.

2647
02:01:51,097 --> 02:01:53,468
See, he's just using
a stencil machine

2648
02:01:53,468 --> 02:01:54,517
and an Underwood.

2649
02:01:54,635 --> 02:01:56,967
Yeah, it's a teller at the bank.

2650
02:01:57,045 --> 02:01:58,327
Say again?

2651
02:01:58,367 --> 02:01:59,844
I-It's definitely a teller,
Carl.

2652
02:01:59,922 --> 02:02:01,943
I mean, banks,
they always use hand-stamps

2653
02:02:02,022 --> 02:02:03,460
for the dates, see.

2654
02:02:03,577 --> 02:02:05,132
They get used
over and over again

2655
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:06,570
so they always get worn out

2656
02:02:06,609 --> 02:02:08,436
and the numbers
are always cracking.

2657
02:02:08,475 --> 02:02:12,090
The sixes and the nines...
see, they go first.

2658
02:02:14,074 --> 02:02:15,862
Thanks.

2659
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:17,845
( buzzer sounding )

2660
02:02:20,411 --> 02:02:22,393
MAN:
I'd like you to take a look

2661
02:02:22,549 --> 02:02:23,443
at something for me.

2662
02:02:27,992 --> 02:02:30,130
Tell me what you think.

2663
02:02:30,209 --> 02:02:32,619
( clears throat )

2664
02:02:32,697 --> 02:02:34,135
That's a fake.

2665
02:02:34,252 --> 02:02:36,106
How do you know?
You haven't looked at it.

2666
02:02:36,107 --> 02:02:38,556
Well, there's
no perforated edge, right?

2667
02:02:38,673 --> 02:02:41,511
I mean, this... this check
was hand-cut, not fed.

2668
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:43,265
Yeah...

2669
02:02:43,266 --> 02:02:44,432
Paper is double-bonded

2670
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:46,764
much too heavy
to be a bank check.

2671
02:02:46,843 --> 02:02:50,691
Magnetic ink, it's, uh,
raised against my fingers

2672
02:02:50,769 --> 02:02:51,974
instead of flat.

2673
02:02:52,052 --> 02:02:53,062
( sniffing )

2674
02:02:53,180 --> 02:02:54,618
And this doesn't smell
like MICR.

2675
02:02:54,696 --> 02:02:55,629
It's some kind of a...

2676
02:02:55,746 --> 02:02:57,378
you know,
some kind of a drafting ink.

2677
02:02:57,418 --> 02:02:59,634
You know, the kind you get
at a stationery store.

2678
02:02:59,711 --> 02:03:00,877
( clears throat )

2679
02:03:03,483 --> 02:03:05,388
( paper rustling )

2680
02:03:05,466 --> 02:03:07,215
Frank...

2681
02:03:07,332 --> 02:03:09,120
would you be interested
in working

2682
02:03:09,198 --> 02:03:11,180
with the FBI's
Financial Crimes Unit?

2683
02:03:11,258 --> 02:03:13,163
( shuffles cards )

2684
02:03:13,202 --> 02:03:14,135
I already got a job here.

2685
02:03:14,213 --> 02:03:15,534
You know, I, uh,
deliver the mail.

2686
02:03:17,712 --> 02:03:22,221
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

2687
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:23,894
You'd be placed
in the custody of the FBI

2688
02:03:24,011 --> 02:03:26,032
where you'd serve out
the remainder of your sentence

2689
02:03:26,071 --> 02:03:27,742
as an employee
of the federal government.

2690
02:03:30,348 --> 02:03:32,253
Under whose custody?

2691
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:40,650
( phone ringing )

2692
02:03:40,767 --> 02:03:43,332
Hi. I-I'm Frank Abagnale.

2693
02:03:43,450 --> 02:03:45,782
I'm supposed to start work
here today.

2694
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:48,348
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

2695
02:03:48,387 --> 02:03:50,486
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.

2696
02:03:50,565 --> 02:03:51,964
I'm going to call you back.

2697
02:04:01,762 --> 02:04:04,522
( melancholy melody playing )

2698
02:04:12,803 --> 02:04:17,079
~ ~

2699
02:04:21,434 --> 02:04:23,377
Hello, Carl.

2700
02:04:23,378 --> 02:04:24,933
Welcome to the FBI.

2701
02:04:25,011 --> 02:04:26,993
I'll show you
where you're working.

2702
02:04:35,209 --> 02:04:38,552
Carl... how long
do I have to work here?

2703
02:04:38,591 --> 02:04:41,156
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon.

2704
02:04:41,235 --> 02:04:43,101
45 minutes for lunch.

2705
02:04:43,179 --> 02:04:45,045
No, I...

2706
02:04:45,162 --> 02:04:47,300
I mean, how long?

2707
02:04:49,088 --> 02:04:51,148
Every day.

2708
02:04:51,266 --> 02:04:53,365
Every day, Frank,
till we let you go.

2709
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:07,866
~ ~

2710
02:05:16,964 --> 02:05:20,812
~ ~

2711
02:05:30,533 --> 02:05:34,576
~ ~

2712
02:05:43,752 --> 02:05:45,851
-( tapping )
-Yeah.

2713
02:05:45,929 --> 02:05:48,767
-Hey, Carl.
-Hi.

2714
02:05:48,845 --> 02:05:51,022
How you doing?

2715
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:52,499
It's not a good time, Frank.

2716
02:05:52,538 --> 02:05:54,443
I'm clearing my desk
for the weekend.

2717
02:05:57,398 --> 02:06:00,158
Carl, you mind if I come
to work with you tomorrow?

2718
02:06:00,236 --> 02:06:02,179
Tomorrow is Saturday.

2719
02:06:02,258 --> 02:06:04,201
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

2720
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:05,757
I'll be back to work on Monday.

2721
02:06:05,835 --> 02:06:06,923
You're going to see Grace, huh?

2722
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:08,478
Well, that's the plan.

2723
02:06:11,083 --> 02:06:12,054
( heavy sigh )

2724
02:06:12,172 --> 02:06:14,310
So what should I do till Monday?

2725
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:15,981
I'm sorry, kid,
I can't help you there.

2726
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:17,070
Excuse me.

2727
02:06:19,987 --> 02:06:23,602
( phone rings )

2728
02:06:23,719 --> 02:06:25,973
This is Hanratty.

2729
02:06:26,052 --> 02:06:27,918
Oh, yeah, put him on.

2730
02:06:35,771 --> 02:06:37,637
Mr. Sawyer.

2731
02:06:37,715 --> 02:06:39,542
How are you?

2732
02:06:39,620 --> 02:06:41,525
I have a half a dozen
more checks

2733
02:06:41,564 --> 02:06:43,507
on that tour operator
at the BVI.

2734
02:06:50,467 --> 02:06:52,372
( laughs quietly )

2735
02:07:02,170 --> 02:07:05,630
~ ~

2736
02:07:05,708 --> 02:07:07,613
( opens and shuts drawer )

2737
02:07:15,855 --> 02:07:18,498
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
American Airlines 355

2738
02:07:18,538 --> 02:07:20,831
serving Chicago
and San Francisco

2739
02:07:20,909 --> 02:07:22,464
is now open
for passenger check-in.

2740
02:07:22,542 --> 02:07:25,730
How'd you do it, Frank?

2741
02:07:25,808 --> 02:07:28,295
How'd you pass the bar
in Louisiana?

2742
02:07:28,296 --> 02:07:30,550
What are you doing here?

2743
02:07:30,629 --> 02:07:32,611
Listen...

2744
02:07:32,728 --> 02:07:34,671
I'm sorry I put you
through all this.

2745
02:07:34,789 --> 02:07:37,588
You go back to Europe, you're
gonna die in Perpignan Prison.

2746
02:07:37,666 --> 02:07:39,143
You try to run
here in the States

2747
02:07:39,221 --> 02:07:41,281
we'll send you
back to Atlanta for 50 years.

2748
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:44,624
I know that.

2749
02:07:44,703 --> 02:07:47,074
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.

2750
02:07:47,152 --> 02:07:48,823
Had to convince my bosses
at the FBI

2751
02:07:48,902 --> 02:07:51,040
and the Attorney General
of the United States

2752
02:07:51,079 --> 02:07:52,012
you wouldn't run.

2753
02:07:52,051 --> 02:07:54,850
Why'd you do it?

2754
02:07:54,928 --> 02:07:56,288
You're just a kid.

2755
02:07:56,366 --> 02:07:58,076
I'm not your kid.

2756
02:07:58,155 --> 02:08:00,448
You said you were
going to Chicago.

2757
02:08:00,526 --> 02:08:02,392
My daughter can't see me
this weekend.

2758
02:08:02,431 --> 02:08:04,336
She's going skiing.

2759
02:08:04,414 --> 02:08:05,891
You said she was four years old.

2760
02:08:05,969 --> 02:08:07,018
You're lying.

2761
02:08:07,097 --> 02:08:08,535
She was four when I left.

2762
02:08:08,691 --> 02:08:10,012
Now she's 15.

2763
02:08:10,091 --> 02:08:13,084
My wife's been remarried
for 11 years.

2764
02:08:13,162 --> 02:08:15,300
I see Grace every now and again.

2765
02:08:15,417 --> 02:08:17,283
I don't understand.

2766
02:08:17,361 --> 02:08:19,227
Sure you do.

2767
02:08:19,305 --> 02:08:21,870
Sometimes it's easier
living the lie.

2768
02:08:25,137 --> 02:08:28,014
I'm going to let you
fly tonight, Frank.

2769
02:08:28,052 --> 02:08:29,879
I'm not even going
to try to stop you.

2770
02:08:29,958 --> 02:08:32,212
That's 'cause I know
you'll be back on Monday.

2771
02:08:32,329 --> 02:08:35,517
Yeah? How do you know
I'll come back?

2772
02:08:35,556 --> 02:08:38,160
( chuckles quietly )

2773
02:08:38,239 --> 02:08:40,377
Look.

2774
02:08:40,416 --> 02:08:42,282
Frank...

2775
02:08:42,321 --> 02:08:44,498
nobody's chasing you.

2776
02:08:44,576 --> 02:08:47,958
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
American Airlines flight 131

2777
02:08:48,075 --> 02:08:50,835
to Pittsburgh
is now ready for boarding.

2778
02:08:50,913 --> 02:08:55,500
Passengers with boarding passes,
please proceed to Gate 23A.

2779
02:09:02,499 --> 02:09:04,093
Okay.

2780
02:09:04,171 --> 02:09:06,309
Alice, has he still not called?

2781
02:09:06,387 --> 02:09:08,292
No, he hasn't.

2782
02:09:19,489 --> 02:09:20,616
HANRATTY:
Good morning.

2783
02:09:20,694 --> 02:09:22,599
I've, uh, called this meeting
to discuss

2784
02:09:22,677 --> 02:09:24,893
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting

2785
02:09:24,971 --> 02:09:27,264
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks

2786
02:09:27,265 --> 02:09:29,170
then passing them
throughout Arizona.

2787
02:09:29,247 --> 02:09:33,173
( panting )

2788
02:09:33,291 --> 02:09:34,807
This unsub is a big dog

2789
02:09:34,846 --> 02:09:36,867
passing checks
as large as five figures.

2790
02:09:36,984 --> 02:09:38,694
( door opening )

2791
02:09:40,211 --> 02:09:43,088
Sorry I'm late.

2792
02:09:43,166 --> 02:09:45,032
Sorry.

2793
02:09:48,609 --> 02:09:51,952
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

2794
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:53,973
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?

2795
02:09:58,173 --> 02:10:01,983
There's impressions
on every line.

2796
02:10:02,022 --> 02:10:05,676
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

2797
02:10:09,331 --> 02:10:10,497
Mind if I take a look?

2798
02:10:13,919 --> 02:10:16,757
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

2799
02:10:18,623 --> 02:10:21,422
Cost the bank $16,000.

2800
02:10:21,461 --> 02:10:23,366
It's a real check.

2801
02:10:23,405 --> 02:10:25,348
Yeah.

2802
02:10:25,388 --> 02:10:26,476
Yeah. It's been washed.

2803
02:10:26,593 --> 02:10:28,498
The only thing original
is the signature.

2804
02:10:28,537 --> 02:10:30,325
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...

2805
02:10:30,403 --> 02:10:32,619
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

2806
02:10:32,658 --> 02:10:34,874
No.

2807
02:10:34,952 --> 02:10:36,546
Something new.

2808
02:10:36,624 --> 02:10:38,645
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone

2809
02:10:38,685 --> 02:10:40,512
removes the ink
that's not been printed?

2810
02:10:44,555 --> 02:10:47,432
How did you do it, Frank?

2811
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:50,348
How did you cheat
on the bar exam in Louisiana?

2812
02:10:55,597 --> 02:10:58,668
I didn't cheat.

2813
02:10:58,824 --> 02:11:02,284
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.

2814
02:11:03,334 --> 02:11:05,588
Is that the truth, Frank?

2815
02:11:05,666 --> 02:11:07,804
Is that the truth?

2816
02:11:07,844 --> 02:11:10,254
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

2817
02:11:10,332 --> 02:11:12,820
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.

2818
02:11:14,647 --> 02:11:16,824
You're saying that he's a local?

2819
02:11:16,863 --> 02:11:18,329
Well, if it were me, you know

2820
02:11:18,546 --> 02:11:20,723
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...

2821
02:11:20,762 --> 02:11:22,278
Make sure there's enough money
in there

2822
02:11:22,356 --> 02:11:23,522
to make it worth your while.

2823
02:11:23,601 --> 02:11:24,689
Exactly.

2824
02:11:24,767 --> 02:11:26,710
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.

2825
02:11:26,789 --> 02:11:28,033
( laughs )

2826
02:11:28,111 --> 02:11:30,365
I guess all we have to do now
is catch him.

2827
02:11:32,271 --> 02:11:34,525
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

2828
02:11:34,603 --> 02:11:36,935
We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.

2829
02:11:36,936 --> 02:11:38,802
In Nevada, Arizona, California.

2830
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,057
Both names, right?
Chris Frank, too?

2831
02:11:41,096 --> 02:11:43,001
Yeah...
