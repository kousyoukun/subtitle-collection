1
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:14,539
This whole country's a battlefront.

2
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,836
This is life and death.

3
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:24,716
That shit you noted is no rehearsal.

4
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:28,870
You gotta have men...
and you <i>must trust</i> these men...

5
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,038
and they <i>must trust</i> you...

6
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:34,559
and I don't care if your men like you...
or your men <i>hate you</i>...

7
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,399
Keep your men alive...
they'll keep <i>you alive!</i>

8
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:42,692
Dismissed.

9
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:51,369
Hi, Sergeant!

10
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,706
Lieutenant Jeff Knight.

11
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:59,110
I see you're with the 173rd.

12
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,962
Why do they call it The Herd anyway?

13
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:09,870
What's it like?

14
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,305
What's it <i>like?</i>

15
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:14,684
It's good!

16
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:18,326
You go out on patrol and
you kill a few of them.

17
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:22,551
Then they kill a few of yours.

18
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,737
Then you go back to base to eat, sleep.

19
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,490
Next day, same thing.

20
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:35,706
Before you know it, you're
either dead or you're goin' home.

21
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,042
It's good!

22
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:23,212
Lieutenant, take
a look at your new home!

23
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:44,696
You go back
to officer's training.

24
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:46,756
You go back?

25
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,426
Check out the new Louie.

26
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,034
Excuse me.

27
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,022
Lieutenant, Sergeant McNamara.

28
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:20,122
Sergeant.

29
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,193
Welcome to the country club.

30
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:25,737
Oh, I wouldn't bother
looking for Lieutenant Frick.

31
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:28,365
He left three days
ago, three days early.

32
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:29,550
What was the problem?

33
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:32,161
No problem.

34
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,013
Well, he called it superstition.

35
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,056
What do you call it?

36
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,127
I'd call it paranoia.

37
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,713
Oh, he had this weird
thing, this funny idea,

38
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:45,633
that there are people out
here trying to shoot his ass.

39
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:46,817
You see that bunker?

40
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:50,513
That's where Frick spent the
last two months of his tour.

41
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,239
Never stepped outside it once.

42
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:54,783
That's officer's quarters.

43
00:05:58,787 --> 00:05:59,872
Thank you, Sergeant.

44
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:02,458
Dismissed.

45
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,031
Lighter.

46
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,327
So what do you think
he's doing' in there?

47
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:40,564
Gettin' drunk or wishin' he were home

48
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:42,232
while he writes a <i>Don't
Worry, I'll Be Home</i>

49
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:44,232
<i>Before You Know It</i> letter to his wife.

50
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:50,256
Good thing he's married.

51
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:53,199
Those guys never like to take chances.

52
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,372
You fuckhead, that means we gotta!

53
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:58,707
So?

54
00:06:58,807 --> 00:06:59,876
There's a gook!

55
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,711
Where, where, where?

56
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:03,254
Hey, don't fuck with me, Bacera.

57
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:06,482
Don't fuck with me
like that goddamn you!

58
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:32,617
Oh man, what did you
do, shit in your pants?

59
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:34,927
You got any fruit in that bag, Bacera?

60
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,998
Come on, man,
I know you got it in there.

61
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:41,334
I'll trade you two cans
of Spam for them peaches.

62
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:42,335
No way, man.

63
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:44,879
Why don't you take some from
that Lieutenant's stash?

64
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,466
I mean, he's gonna be gone
before he can eat it up anyway.

65
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,676
Nah, he's gonna hibernate
in that rabbit hole

66
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:52,429
then when his tour's up he's
gonna pop up like a rabbit.

67
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:55,449
Yo, let me explain to
you about the new second...

68
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:05,859
Oh, sorry, sir, sorry.

69
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,652
You Okay?

70
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,945
Morning.

71
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:11,740
Joshua Parker, I'm your radio
operator.

72
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,841
Morning, Parker.

73
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,720
Get all the squad leaders
and the squads formed up.

74
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,581
Sir?

75
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:22,267
You want all the squad
leaders to form up?

76
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:25,395
Out here?

77
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,608
Okay, sir.

78
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,451
All right, come on,
dress it up, dress it up!

79
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:46,484
Sergeant Hayes, sir.

80
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:48,584
Welcome to Second
Platoon, Bravo Company.

81
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:50,588
Thank you, Sergeant.

82
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,576
Sergeant Roach, welcome to Nam.

83
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:58,554
Hey, that sounds like a poem.

84
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:05,937
Morning, men.

85
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:08,172
Glad to be among you.

86
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:09,507
Since I know we're gonna
learn more than enough

87
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:10,842
about each other in the day's ahead,

88
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:13,970
we can drop the social stuff
and get down to business.

89
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,696
What else is there around here?

90
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,061
What's your name, soldier?

91
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,789
Bacera, Raymond Bacera.

92
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:37,745
Our mission here is to protect
the village of Truong Lam.

93
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,305
Everything we do is in response to that.

94
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,433
We need to be ready for them.

95
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,961
If we're to stop the enemy,

96
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,212
we'll have to destroy
their raiding parties

97
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:48,897
and advance forces.

98
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:53,510
And to stop them, we'll have
to cut 'em off at the roots.

99
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,779
You're talkin' about
takin' over Hanoi, sir?

100
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,781
Not yet.

101
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,017
I'm talking about
patrolling the countryside.

102
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:01,185
HQ says this area's gonna get hot,

103
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,020
and I have to prepare for it.

104
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,066
We'll be sending out
three patrols a day.

105
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,233
Staggered of course
with different timing

106
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,069
and routes, every day.

107
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:10,570
Yeah, and they'll be coordinated

108
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,922
from in Frick's office, eh?

109
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,467
Hey, shut up.

110
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:21,389
I'm going out on one patrol a day.

111
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:24,267
Dismissed.

112
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,045
All right, spread out, on the double!

113
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,146
Get to your posts.

114
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:34,944
Sergeant McNamara.

115
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:41,434
I wanna go over the new
perimeter defences with ya.

116
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,495
Well, you got it all worked
out, don't you, Lieutenant?

117
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,108
No, but at least I'm trying.

118
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,195
Ah, well, if VC ever starts
giving us grades for effort

119
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:54,156
then you're gonna do real good.

120
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:56,784
Why don't you just cut the shit, huh?

121
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:57,618
Just cut the shit,
and while you're at it,

122
00:10:57,718 --> 00:10:59,578
just cut the grass on both
sides of that trail shorter,

123
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:00,913
and you keep it that way.

124
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:03,124
That's right outta
the textbook, huh, LT?

125
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,416
Yeah, it's worked before.

126
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:06,794
Before wasn't the Nam!

127
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:08,129
But textbooks tell you where to

128
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:10,798
point these M60s into the jungle?

129
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:12,716
Because the book is wrong!

130
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:13,551
They shouldn't be
pointing into the jungle.

131
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:14,927
You gotta point 'em
right down Main Street.

132
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:17,263
Right down the centre of Truong Lam

133
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:18,848
because that's where Charlie is.

134
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:21,475
He's as thick there
as he is in the bush.

135
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:24,078
You're gonna learn that, fast.

136
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:29,166
You gotta know that if
you wanna be good here.

137
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:48,712
Okay, Sergeant, what's our target?

138
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:52,048
Well, Roach's patrol found
evidence of a VC campsite

139
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:54,843
about two clicks
northeast of the village.

140
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:56,845
I figure we set up an
ambush, wait and see

141
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:58,245
if Charlie shows up again.

142
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:00,657
Okay, let's move out.

143
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:21,870
Lieutenant, one
of the things they don't

144
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,831
teach you about the jungle at West Point

145
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:27,977
is that when it looks safe, it ain't.

146
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:10,629
Present for ya.

147
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:11,730
Basera.

148
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:30,482
This thing were to blow,

149
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:32,959
they'd be picking pieces
of you outta the trees.

150
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,030
Now this is as far as we go.

151
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,847
Get down, get down!

152
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,093
Unfuckin' believable!

153
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:26,996
You better believe it, Bacera.

154
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:29,056
Now let's get the fuck outta here!

155
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:38,632
That's why you
guys wait till they get inside.

156
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:39,508
Right there.

157
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:40,693
He can see me.

158
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,805
Yo, I need a box here!

159
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,015
Hey, Josh,
man, I shit my pants

160
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,266
when Josh did that.

161
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:48,701
Fore!

162
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,537
Doing armed patrol again, Lieutenant?

163
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,691
Every day until we own
this district, Parker.

164
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,834
Got a job to do.

165
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:58,486
You ain't gonna be much good

166
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:00,629
if you fall asleep on the job, LT.

167
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,346
Hey, I'll go get my radio, okay?

168
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,870
What are you doin'?

169
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:36,497
VC.

170
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:42,503
Hold on!

171
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,434
If they're VC, we'll take 'em alive.

172
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:34,456
That was about the best way to

173
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:38,794
let the whole fuckin'
countryside know we're coming!

174
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:39,962
Jesus!

175
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:42,022
Basera, Roach, torch it!

176
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:12,470
Forward!

177
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,681
Psst!

178
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,018
Tunnel

179
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:22,483
Shit!

180
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,583
Fuck!

181
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:27,554
Where the fuck is he?

182
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:34,079
Move!

183
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:35,180
Holy shit!

184
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:37,641
Where the fuck is he?

185
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:41,269
Locate him, locate him!

186
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,272
Move it!

187
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:57,744
You fuck.

188
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:13,697
A tunnel.

189
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:05,750
Shultz.

190
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,948
You lucked out again, LT, aye?

191
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:02,791
Oh, Jesus.

192
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:04,101
No, Lieutenant!

193
00:26:10,274 --> 00:26:11,216
Oh, Jesus.

194
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,552
What happened?

195
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:15,262
Parker, how bad am I?

196
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:16,180
You're okay, you're okay, okay?

197
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,475
Alpha 6-1, this is Alpha 6-2.

198
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:21,394
Do you read me? 6-2 is
down, he's been hit, okay?

199
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:23,521
Get a medevac over here immediately!

200
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:26,649
I'm on fire, ah!

201
00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:28,693
I'm burning!

202
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:31,154
I'm on fire!

203
00:26:31,254 --> 00:26:32,781
Shh, you'll be okay, all right?

204
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:35,784
I'm on fire!

205
00:26:35,884 --> 00:26:36,743
Shit.

206
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:38,244
All right, let's move 'em!

207
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:41,014
Let's get 'em to an
LZ, come on, move it!

208
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:45,518
Come on, damn it, come on!

209
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,430
Hang in there, Lieutenant!

210
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,599
We'll get you outta here.

211
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:02,018
Take care of yourself,
all right? Watch his leg.

212
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:03,228
Come on, let's go.

213
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:04,939
All right, move!

214
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,482
Come on, move out, move!

215
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:08,209
All right, move out!

216
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:39,990
How you feelin', Lieutenant?

217
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,243
Bored.

218
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,395
Well, that may be the case,

219
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,331
but I want you to give me
five more days in here.

220
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:50,193
You see,
your district is heating up, son,

221
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,946
and I need ya back there, but
I need you back there well.

222
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,074
You see, Truong Lam is
the only non-VC village

223
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,094
in that whole district.

224
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,598
And it really pisses the NVA off.

225
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,935
It's a propaganda embarrassment.

226
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,981
They want your fire base, son.

227
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,342
They want to take it back
from me and they want it bad.

228
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,443
Major.

229
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,015
For us to be more effective
out there, we need more men...

230
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,715
We need more tactical support...

231
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,270
And I know you've heard
it 1000 times before,

232
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,563
but that's just the way it is.

233
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,772
I haven't heard that 1000 times, son...

234
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,942
I've heard that a MILLION goddamn times.

235
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,987
And I'm gonna tell you right
now, Lieutenant Knight.

236
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,697
I will promise you I will
do the best I can for you,

237
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,050
and that's all I can promise you.

238
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,371
Is there anything else, son?

239
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,472
Yeah.

240
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,765
Can you get me outta here in three days?

241
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,062
We'll work on that, Knight.

242
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:03,826
Thanks, guys.

243
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,542
Mac, run that by me again.

244
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,529
Basically, there's
three stages, you know?

245
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,574
First of all, you really
get a hold of that baby

246
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:19,742
and just get it right where you want her

247
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,577
and steady her, right?

248
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,123
And take your thumbs,
get it into the mouth,

249
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:26,291
hook it around the lips and then

250
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,710
- pry that baby open.
- Ah, doesn't she scream?

251
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,045
Scream?

252
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,922
I never heard one scream.

253
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:34,091
Wiggle, you know.

254
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:36,510
Okay, the next thing.

255
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,154
Reach down, grab your needle
nose, get it in there.

256
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,993
Grab a hold of that hook, take it out.

257
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,788
That baby is ready to mount.

258
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,207
I can get behind that.

259
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,569
I mounted three trout in one season.

260
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:55,837
Two large-mouthed bass.

261
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,615
I didn't know you were
that much of a fisherman.

262
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,215
Yeah. You've never seen
a bit of the angle, roomie.

263
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,052
Yeah.

264
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:19,095
You're right about that.

265
00:30:19,195 --> 00:30:20,571
Hey, slick, man.

266
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:27,645
Oh, no.

267
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:28,746
Look who's back.

268
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:34,836
Oh, shit!

269
00:30:36,754 --> 00:30:38,906
I don't believe it.

270
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,800
Shit, look!

271
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,474
You know, well, we didn't.

272
00:32:11,226 --> 00:32:15,522
We didn't think you were coming
back, you know.

273
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:20,635
Thanks for the loan of the book, sir.

274
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:21,735
I enjoyed it.

275
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:29,703
Now, that's a nice little fire.

276
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:32,206
Sandbags.

277
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:03,971
Ladies, ladies, how you doin'?

278
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:05,221
No smiles for me today?

279
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,590
Got anything for me to eat?

280
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,061
Nice talkin' to you.

281
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,497
Bye bye.

282
00:33:30,223 --> 00:33:31,041
What's the matter, Hayes?

283
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,041
You always shy away from pretty girls?

284
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:36,313
I ain't shyin' away.

285
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:39,566
That girl...

286
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:44,179
she and her boyfriend was
with this group of Cong.

287
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,029
Walked through one of our ambushes.

288
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:48,365
Her boyfriend got zapped.

289
00:33:49,534 --> 00:33:54,080
She caught one in the
arm, mangled as shit.

290
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,316
Sent her to one of those aids stations,

291
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:58,902
but they couldn't do
nothin' about that arm.

292
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:00,552
Guess she's goin' back to work.

293
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:07,345
What do you say to a girl
whose arm you shot off?

294
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:17,772
Sir?

295
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:20,466
Parker, don't you ever knock?

296
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:21,634
Sir?

297
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:23,970
I'm sorry, sir, you want me do it again?

298
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,613
Just give me the papers.

299
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:28,849
Intelligence came in not more
than five minutes ago, sir.

300
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,017
There's some heavy fighting up north.

301
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:34,814
Intelligence sees a heavy build-up
of VC strength developing.

302
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:36,899
They say we gotta watch our ass, sir.

303
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:37,775
Numbers?

304
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,652
Well, they say the VC could be

305
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:42,029
building up to battalion strength.

306
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:43,573
That's 18 against 200, sir.

307
00:34:43,673 --> 00:34:45,675
We gotta get some help in
here, you know?

308
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:50,664
You really think so, Parker?

309
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:51,848
Yes, sir, I do.

310
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,811
Well.

311
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:58,088
I can't wait on new men.

312
00:34:58,188 --> 00:34:59,815
I can't keep building.

313
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:03,902
But what we can do is hit
'em with a quick strike.

314
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:08,181
Get in there, shoot 'em
up, and get outta there.

315
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:09,141
Is Roach out on patrol?

316
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,242
Yes, he is.

317
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:15,939
Tell McNamara and
Hayes to get in here.

318
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:16,773
Get ready for Patrol.

319
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:18,650
Hey, Parker.

320
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,735
Forgot your cap.

321
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:21,294
Thanks, sir.

322
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:36,127
Okay, we join up with
Hayes patrol at 0800 hours.

323
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:37,562
You'll be point.

324
00:36:38,874 --> 00:36:42,611
Pilot Twister 2-1,
this is Pilot Twister 5-2.

325
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:44,238
This is 2-1, Alpha, over.

326
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:47,991
This is 5-2,
tell 2-1 he better come quick.

327
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:49,741
We got a body on the trail, over.

328
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:53,180
Get the location, tell
him not to move the body.

329
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:58,961
5-2, 2-1 says get me a
location, don't touch the body.

330
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:00,437
Roger.

331
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:25,947
It's Hayes little friend.

332
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:28,842
We checked her out, no booby
traps or nothin' like that.

333
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:32,136
She's clean, just fuckin' dead.

334
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,052
Tuan Co Tuy has been found guilty

335
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:51,556
by the People's Court of aiding
the American imperialists

336
00:37:51,656 --> 00:37:55,186
in their suppression of
the Vietnamese people.

337
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:58,147
This is the justice that
will be brought to all who

338
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:01,525
consort with the Americans and aid them

339
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,752
in the villainous
suppression of our land.

340
00:38:05,588 --> 00:38:07,615
Fuck me, this is a form letter!

341
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:10,009
They just wrote her name in it.

342
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,998
What the fuck are you?

343
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:17,792
I'm fuckin' Airborne.

344
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:20,419
You think you're
ready to kill somethin'?

345
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,562
Come.

346
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:07,315
All right.

347
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:11,778
Move out.

348
00:41:57,074 --> 00:42:00,828
I shoulda heard from
McNamara's patrol by now.

349
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:03,988
Parker, get him on the radio.

350
00:42:05,165 --> 00:42:06,959
5-2, this is 2-1, over.

351
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:10,254
This is 2-1, over.

352
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:13,866
I'm not gettin' anything
but static, sir.

353
00:42:13,966 --> 00:42:14,992
Okay.

354
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:16,343
5-2, do you read me?

355
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,705
Spread out and be alert.

356
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:21,723
52, this is 21.

357
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:29,022
Incoming!

358
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:40,660
Sons of bitches!

359
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:07,478
Stop it!

360
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:15,111
Parker!

361
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:17,907
Stop it, no!

362
00:43:35,174 --> 00:43:36,659
Parker, where are you?

363
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:38,494
I need your radio!

364
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:41,889
No, no.

365
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:47,837
Parker, where the hell?

366
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:49,588
Get your freakin' ass over here!

367
00:43:49,688 --> 00:43:50,689
Move it!

368
00:43:51,357 --> 00:43:52,566
I can't, sir.

369
00:43:55,152 --> 00:43:56,512
I can't.

370
00:43:56,612 --> 00:43:58,113
Parker!

371
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:09,834
Parker!

372
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:15,448
Parker!

373
00:44:15,548 --> 00:44:16,825
Stop.

374
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:18,034
Parker.

375
00:44:18,134 --> 00:44:19,619
No!

376
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:20,720
God, no!

377
00:44:21,513 --> 00:44:22,514
No!

378
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:25,475
God!

379
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,103
Medic, medic!

380
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:36,136
Mac, get your ass over
here, Parker's been hit.

381
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:39,139
Mac, do you read me?

382
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:39,973
Shit.

383
00:44:40,073 --> 00:44:41,074
Goddamn it!

384
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:48,540
McNamara!

385
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:56,924
Lieutenant, this man's dead.

386
00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:00,303
No, God, no!

387
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:08,894
Roach, secure the right flank!

388
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:17,802
Mac, your right, your right.

389
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:22,283
Mother fucker!

390
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:26,312
No, stop!

391
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:28,372
Don't shoot, she's got a baby.

392
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:36,089
Oh, shit!

393
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:39,009
Parker!

394
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:04,451
Bacera, mother fucker!

395
00:46:05,994 --> 00:46:07,496
Okay, comin' in!

396
00:46:08,497 --> 00:46:09,664
Move from my ass!

397
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,483
Cease fire!

398
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,584
Cease fire!

399
00:46:55,169 --> 00:46:57,947
All right, secure the area!

400
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,047
All right, they're headed towards Roach.

401
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,747
Lieutenant, permission to interrogate.

402
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:13,608
You turn it off, Shultz.

403
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:17,170
It's good enough killing for
one day and you know damn well.

404
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:13,060
Sir.

405
00:49:14,395 --> 00:49:16,130
Good job you did out
there today, Lieutenant.

406
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,523
Thank you, sir.

407
00:49:18,732 --> 00:49:20,484
I believe you know Captain Davies.

408
00:49:21,694 --> 00:49:23,471
Good work, Jeff.

409
00:49:23,571 --> 00:49:25,431
You don't mind if we look around here?

410
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:26,532
Be my guest.

411
00:49:28,285 --> 00:49:31,271
Go to your quarters and
have a talk, Lieutenant?

412
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:33,231
After you, sir.

413
00:49:33,331 --> 00:49:34,357
Interview these two here.

414
00:49:34,457 --> 00:49:35,458
Yes, sir.

415
00:49:40,672 --> 00:49:42,115
Hi, Sergeant.

416
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:45,494
Now, according to Major Flynn,

417
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:47,787
this action of yours put you guys firmly

418
00:49:47,887 --> 00:49:49,431
in control of the countryside.

419
00:49:53,768 --> 00:49:56,479
I concur wholeheartedly
with the major's evaluation.

420
00:49:58,148 --> 00:50:01,818
Off the record, the major
don't know mother fuckin' shit!

421
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:05,138
You heard what he said.

422
00:50:05,238 --> 00:50:06,556
You still got ears.

423
00:50:06,656 --> 00:50:08,617
Maybe I'd like to hear some more.

424
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,541
Yeah.

425
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:17,918
Yeah.

426
00:50:19,045 --> 00:50:21,464
I want you to hear some more.

427
00:50:24,675 --> 00:50:25,676
Hear this.

428
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:31,599
Ah, Jesus, Roach!

429
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:36,354
I was just trying to be helpful.

430
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:46,781
Sit down, Lieutenant.

431
00:50:52,995 --> 00:50:55,690
What we have here, I believe,

432
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,693
is a setup for a major VC offensive.

433
00:50:58,793 --> 00:51:00,643
They want you outta here, Lieutenant.

434
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:02,614
But if you and your men fight like you

435
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:03,615
have been for the last...

436
00:51:03,715 --> 00:51:04,741
Sir.

437
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:08,120
You gotta understand, we
were lucky out there today.

438
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,413
Lucky.

439
00:51:09,513 --> 00:51:12,958
When I lose men on patrol,
no one replaces them, no one.

440
00:51:13,058 --> 00:51:17,546
We kill five VC, 10
more take their place.

441
00:51:17,646 --> 00:51:20,107
If we really wanna get
aggressive with the VC,

442
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:22,567
we need more men.

443
00:51:24,945 --> 00:51:27,489
You're gonna get 'em,
you're by God gonna get 'em.

444
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:35,272
Now, why don't you go clean
yourself up, Lieutenant.

445
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:37,082
Have a beer, you've earned it.

446
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:41,920
Keep your head down, son.

447
00:52:04,777 --> 00:52:07,321
How many new replacements?

448
00:52:14,662 --> 00:52:18,082
Whoopee, three new cherries, wow.

449
00:52:24,005 --> 00:52:25,905
Hey, come here
for one second, will ya?

450
00:52:26,716 --> 00:52:27,408
I'm trying
to get a good sizing

451
00:52:27,508 --> 00:52:29,260
of this place anyway.

452
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:39,171
Get away from my pants, man.

453
00:52:39,271 --> 00:52:43,567
Maybe we can
get a bar thing going, huh?

454
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:46,570
Relax, soldier, I'm not the enemy.

455
00:52:51,825 --> 00:52:52,851
RTO?

456
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:54,269
Yes, sir.

457
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:55,829
Welcome to the country club.

458
00:53:02,252 --> 00:53:03,552
What's your name, soldier?

459
00:53:04,546 --> 00:53:06,381
Well, you can call me Gruesome, man.

460
00:53:07,841 --> 00:53:09,827
I'll ask you once more.

461
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:12,329
This time you answer with
Lieutenant or Sir behind it.

462
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:14,498
Private Don Pike, sir.

463
00:53:14,598 --> 00:53:16,048
How long you been here, Pike?

464
00:53:17,518 --> 00:53:21,589
All fuckin' day, Lieutenant.

465
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:23,842
I mean in Vietnam and
speed up the Lieutenant.

466
00:53:23,942 --> 00:53:25,151
Five weeks, Lieutenant.

467
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:29,013
You're angry Uncle
Sam got ya, right, Pike?

468
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:30,740
Shit no, man, I enlisted.

469
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:33,935
You see, I had a little
disagreement over some merchandise

470
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:36,146
with some suppliers back in the States.

471
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,148
I put him and his
partner outta business.

472
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,733
Till the streets cool down,

473
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:42,068
Nam's the only safe place for me, Jack.

474
00:53:42,168 --> 00:53:44,195
See, I'm down for the ice.

475
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:47,382
I'm down for the grease, that's
why I'm the greaser, man.

476
00:53:48,341 --> 00:53:50,218
Lieutenant, whatever.

477
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,559
Hey, you know something, private?

478
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,254
Nam ain't safe for you either.

479
00:54:01,354 --> 00:54:03,423
We got plenty of killers
out here better than you.

480
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:05,551
You wanna grease somebody,
you do it under orders.

481
00:54:05,651 --> 00:54:08,220
You wanna take a shit,
you do it under orders.

482
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,531
I want you to go to your
quarters and unpack.

483
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:14,101
And I want you to report
to Sergeant Roach.

484
00:54:14,201 --> 00:54:16,370
I'm putting you out on
mine-sweeping patrol.

485
00:54:17,663 --> 00:54:19,123
And that's an order.

486
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,292
Dismissed.

487
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:25,296
Mine-sweeping?

488
00:55:18,058 --> 00:55:21,019
Hey, Greaser, come
here, give me a hand.

489
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:29,634
Show me your trigger finger, man.

490
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,770
Now you hold that down real still

491
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:41,582
and keep it real still otherwise
your shit's in the wind.

492
00:55:44,585 --> 00:55:45,903
Christ, this shit makes me so nervous.

493
00:55:46,003 --> 00:55:47,153
I gotta go take a piss.

494
00:55:48,422 --> 00:55:49,632
Back in a flash, bro.

495
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:26,159
Go ahead, you can take it off now.

496
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,323
Here, you saw what I did, right?

497
00:56:29,423 --> 00:56:31,273
Next time you get to do it solo, man.

498
00:56:45,897 --> 00:56:47,983
You better learn to
deal with this shit.

499
00:56:52,529 --> 00:56:55,098
Death is the ultimate
alarm clock, man.

500
00:56:55,198 --> 00:56:56,199
Wakes you up.

501
00:57:02,873 --> 00:57:04,291
Where's Bacera?

502
00:57:20,808 --> 00:57:22,185
Bacera!

503
00:57:24,771 --> 00:57:25,772
Yo, LT.

504
00:57:30,276 --> 00:57:33,054
You're supposed to be on
patrol right now, Bacera.

505
00:57:33,154 --> 00:57:34,389
Shit.

506
00:57:34,489 --> 00:57:36,140
I'm not feelin' so good today.

507
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,601
I thought I'd just
write my mom a letter.

508
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:40,228
You call me Lieutenant.

509
00:57:40,328 --> 00:57:41,329
Hey, no, problem.

510
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:47,460
What's this?

511
00:57:48,753 --> 00:57:49,779
What do you think?

512
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:50,880
It's mine.

513
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:58,305
Get out to your squad,
it's time for patrol.

514
00:58:17,282 --> 00:58:20,953
Sorry, Lieutenant,
I dropped my weapon.

515
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,124
Oh, man, hey.

516
00:58:32,422 --> 00:58:33,423
Stay.

517
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:38,662
Drop your weapon
again, you little fuck!

518
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:41,623
You better pray to god it
hits me square in the back.

519
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:44,669
Because if it doesn't, you little fuck,

520
00:58:44,769 --> 00:58:46,087
I'll splatter your fuckin' brains

521
00:58:46,187 --> 00:58:49,632
across this goddamn base
camp, you understand?

522
00:58:49,732 --> 00:58:51,067
Better leave him alone.

523
00:58:52,026 --> 00:58:53,027
Fuck you!

524
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:57,766
You better do somethin' now.

525
00:58:57,866 --> 00:58:58,867
Stay out of it.

526
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:26,477
Hey, hold up.

527
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:30,482
I gotta take a piss and a shit, sir.

528
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,113
Don't forget to wipe!

529
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,187
What I wanna know is,
why whenever Bacera's

530
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:46,774
gotta take a leak, he's
all nervous and jumpy?

531
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:47,858
And then when he comes
back from the leak

532
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,293
he's all calm and serene.

533
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:55,090
I'll get him.

534
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,327
Well, what do we got?

535
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,999
Somebody declare a holiday
for psychedelic fuck heads?

536
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,335
Huh?

537
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,366
Oh.

538
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,659
Oh, no.

539
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,760
No!

540
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,932
Oh, fuck!

541
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,589
You should've gone home, kid.

542
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,275
You were good enough to go home!

543
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,576
No, no.

544
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:38,362
The enemy got him.

545
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,283
No, Bacera, goddammit!

546
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,911
Ah, please, God, please!

547
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:50,292
Oh God, please, don't die, Bacera!

548
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:53,612
Please, brother, don't die!

549
01:01:53,712 --> 01:01:55,322
Please, wake up!

550
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:56,715
Wake up, Bacera!

551
01:01:58,091 --> 01:02:00,385
You son of a bitch, wake up!

552
01:02:01,261 --> 01:02:03,722
Wake up, please, God, wake up!

553
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:06,516
Oh God!

554
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:10,228
I'll write his mother
so she's proud of him.

555
01:04:07,682 --> 01:04:10,059
Get the men ready, there's
gonna be an attack.

556
01:04:27,452 --> 01:04:28,495
Fire the flare!

557
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:41,090
Holy shit.

558
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:43,301
Fuck me!

559
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:46,246
They will if they get up here.

560
01:04:46,346 --> 01:04:47,347
Open fire!

561
01:04:48,348 --> 01:04:53,312
Fire!

562
01:05:18,546 --> 01:05:19,838
Dickhead mother fuckers!

563
01:05:36,272 --> 01:05:38,566
Shoot, shoot, now!

564
01:05:44,781 --> 01:05:46,266
Lieutenant!

565
01:05:46,366 --> 01:05:48,034
Lieutenant, Tiger One!

566
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:55,567
This is LZ north, come in, Tiger One.

567
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:57,903
This is Tiger
One, what do you need LZ?

568
01:05:58,003 --> 01:05:59,613
Night ship support, we're
under heavy fire here.

569
01:05:59,713 --> 01:06:01,490
We
read you, fire base,

570
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,285
air support is on it's
way, just hang in there.

571
01:06:05,385 --> 01:06:07,304
Hurry it UP!

572
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:23,528
Larsen, get down!

573
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,142
So you wanna come over the wire?

574
01:06:28,242 --> 01:06:30,328
Fuckin' might barbecue you assholes!

575
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,622
- Come on!
- Let's move out the ammo!

576
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:13,313
Where's the fear?

577
01:07:13,413 --> 01:07:14,831
Meet Mr. Fear!

578
01:08:03,089 --> 01:08:04,989
Let's waste those mother fuckers, man!

579
01:08:25,653 --> 01:08:28,890
Fire Base,
Fire Base, this is Tiger One.

580
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:30,558
Lieutenant, tell your men to get down.

581
01:08:30,658 --> 01:08:33,394
We're gonna light up the sky.

582
01:08:33,494 --> 01:08:35,163
Get down, get down!

583
01:09:06,737 --> 01:09:07,971
Fire, get down!

584
01:09:08,071 --> 01:09:09,072
Fuck you!

585
01:09:14,286 --> 01:09:17,022
Okay, cease fire!

586
01:09:17,122 --> 01:09:18,148
No!

587
01:09:18,248 --> 01:09:19,817
I said cease fire!

588
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:22,419
Hold your fire, shit!

589
01:09:32,514 --> 01:09:35,683
Okay, let's get a body
count and clean this place up!

590
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,130
Hayes, get your squad and follow me.

591
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:41,923
Shultz, come with me!

592
01:09:42,023 --> 01:09:43,691
Roach, secure the base.

593
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:45,944
You got it, LT.

594
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:48,805
I'll meet you at the village.

595
01:09:48,905 --> 01:09:52,534
Somebody get
that goddamn medic now!

596
01:10:31,323 --> 01:10:32,908
I don't know, Mac.

597
01:10:34,368 --> 01:10:39,290
I know I'm doin' my job but.

598
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:43,486
What do you think your job is?

599
01:10:43,586 --> 01:10:47,172
I'm protecting the
village and the people.

600
01:10:50,426 --> 01:10:51,594
I don't know, Mac.

601
01:10:53,554 --> 01:10:55,454
I'm just following the fucking orders!

602
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,450
Why, you know something I don't?

603
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:02,487
What's your job, Mac?

604
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:06,318
My job is getting people
to change their minds.

605
01:11:08,945 --> 01:11:10,680
Know the way I figure it?

606
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,558
Everybody's got a business, you know?

607
01:11:13,658 --> 01:11:18,413
Like the farm business, shoe business,

608
01:11:19,331 --> 01:11:20,665
manufacturing business.

609
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,610
We're in the idea business.

610
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:26,004
That's right, we sell ideas.

611
01:11:27,422 --> 01:11:29,741
And if you can't get a sale.

612
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:34,804
If you can't place the
right idea in their head,

613
01:11:40,977 --> 01:11:42,627
place one of these in their body.

614
01:11:52,448 --> 01:11:55,076
We don't have to change
their minds but, hell,

615
01:11:57,954 --> 01:11:59,230
sure makes the neighbours a lot more

616
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,624
interested in what we're selling.

617
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:15,888
Hi, Jeff.

618
01:12:17,098 --> 01:12:18,198
I got Scott and Riley.

619
01:12:19,058 --> 01:12:21,085
Lieutenants.

620
01:12:21,185 --> 01:12:22,186
Pull up a chair.

621
01:12:29,276 --> 01:12:30,528
You heard the news?

622
01:12:32,697 --> 01:12:35,182
A VC company ran into you.

623
01:12:35,282 --> 01:12:37,352
They took the South
Vietnamese at Tay Ny.

624
01:12:37,452 --> 01:12:38,495
One survivor.

625
01:12:39,246 --> 01:12:41,523
Command went for your request, Jeff.

626
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,066
Intelligence says the VC are moving

627
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,319
through IV East English as we speak.

628
01:12:45,419 --> 01:12:46,153
Now, they agree with you.

629
01:12:46,253 --> 01:12:49,203
There's a good chance we could
stop 'em with a first strike.

630
01:12:49,673 --> 01:12:51,675
They put the operation under my command.

631
01:12:55,345 --> 01:12:58,457
I wanna go over the details
of our plan with you.

632
01:12:58,557 --> 01:12:59,558
Hold that.

633
01:13:00,684 --> 01:13:04,254
Your platoon,
Second along with the Third,

634
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:06,882
will link up and move in
on Charlie's flank here.

635
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,676
First Platoon will constitute
the reserve company

636
01:13:09,776 --> 01:13:11,053
and remain at it's platoon perimeter

637
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,888
there provide mortar support.

638
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,640
It's text book operation.

639
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:15,991
Where will you be, sir?

640
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,226
Oh, here with the first.

641
01:13:18,326 --> 01:13:19,937
That's the best way I can
control the fire support

642
01:13:20,037 --> 01:13:21,021
and movement of the reserve,

643
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:21,855
as well as give access to readies

644
01:13:21,955 --> 01:13:24,025
with battalion and Alpha Company.

645
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:26,110
Even forgetting that
that puts you 4000 meters

646
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:28,629
from the objective, it won't work.

647
01:13:31,924 --> 01:13:34,327
Lieutenant, have you
been out here so long

648
01:13:34,427 --> 01:13:36,162
you've forgotten the rules of conduct?

649
01:13:36,262 --> 01:13:38,039
Sorry, sir, no, but I have
been out here long enough

650
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:39,289
to know what will work.

651
01:13:41,142 --> 01:13:43,644
And what would that be, Lieutenant?

652
01:13:46,647 --> 01:13:48,007
Link up between two keyed up platoons

653
01:13:48,107 --> 01:13:50,218
is a form of suicide.

654
01:13:50,318 --> 01:13:52,178
There's too much room for error,

655
01:13:52,278 --> 01:13:54,322
especially since it's
the VC's territory.

656
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:56,474
Besides, we know they're coming to us,

657
01:13:56,574 --> 01:13:58,974
and to do that they have
to cross this open area.

658
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:02,438
Let's wait, trap Charlie.

659
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:04,232
The Third Platoon here to the west

660
01:14:04,332 --> 01:14:06,150
and my platoon here at the east flank.

661
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,446
Let the VC come through,
we squeeze them to death.

662
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:10,406
They could put the First here

663
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:11,699
where they can provide mortar support

664
01:14:11,799 --> 01:14:12,950
and still be close enough as a reserve

665
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,535
in case it gets too thick
for us and the Third.

666
01:14:14,635 --> 01:14:17,204
Yeah, but that puts the
Third in your territory.

667
01:14:17,304 --> 01:14:18,706
They are not familiar with it.

668
01:14:18,806 --> 01:14:20,249
No, just inside, sir.

669
01:14:20,349 --> 01:14:22,799
We'll send a man over to
take 'em to the position.

670
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:29,789
Scott, you got the
Third, how does it feel?

671
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:32,845
It's lookin' pretty good, Captain.

672
01:14:32,945 --> 01:14:35,405
It'll make our fire
power more effective.

673
01:14:39,034 --> 01:14:41,578
All right, if that's
the way you men feel.

674
01:14:42,871 --> 01:14:44,748
It's in your hands now, Jeff.

675
01:14:49,044 --> 01:14:50,170
Okay, let's move out!

676
01:15:37,218 --> 01:15:38,703
Okay.

677
01:15:38,803 --> 01:15:40,205
This is it.

678
01:15:40,305 --> 01:15:41,290
We're gonna meet up with the Third

679
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,767
and lead 'em back here
to their ambush position.

680
01:15:47,271 --> 01:15:49,340
What's the matter?

681
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,192
I don't know, and I don't like it.

682
01:15:54,111 --> 01:15:56,639
That sixth sense workin' overtime?

683
01:15:56,739 --> 01:15:58,824
Well, I've survived this long with it.

684
01:16:00,284 --> 01:16:01,977
Want me to send someone else?

685
01:16:02,077 --> 01:16:03,604
Come on, I didn't say that.

686
01:16:03,704 --> 01:16:04,705
What is it then?

687
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,378
When was the last confirmed sighting?

688
01:16:12,421 --> 01:16:13,964
You just keep your head down.

689
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,883
You're thick.

690
01:16:17,593 --> 01:16:19,637
Okay, okay, no problem.

691
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:18,906
2-6, this
is 3-6, come in, over.

692
01:17:20,366 --> 01:17:22,451
This is the Third,
where's your man, over?

693
01:17:23,494 --> 01:17:24,353
He's on his way to you guys.

694
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:26,480
I've made
negative contact with your man.

695
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,859
It's too late, the VC are
heading in your direction, out.

696
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:30,960
Shit!

697
01:17:31,877 --> 01:17:33,879
McNamara's headed right towards them.

698
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:10,584
Let's go!

699
01:18:43,742 --> 01:18:45,285
Let's go!

700
01:18:46,203 --> 01:18:48,081
Let's get outta here!

701
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:28,246
Hang on, all right?

702
01:19:30,206 --> 01:19:32,358
- Move it!
- How is he?

703
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:33,902
HOW IS HE?

704
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:34,945
He's bad, LT.

705
01:19:35,045 --> 01:19:36,238
Shit, LT, there's gooks everywhere!

706
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:37,948
You got a medevac in here!

707
01:19:38,048 --> 01:19:39,700
Call the CO and tell him our situation!

708
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,801
Go, move!

709
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,206
I'll get you in there, man.

710
01:19:46,306 --> 01:19:48,684
Come on, man, you stay alive!

711
01:19:50,936 --> 01:19:51,937
Come on!

712
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:53,981
Secure the area!

713
01:19:55,816 --> 01:19:57,151
Shultz, cover my ass!

714
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:00,027
Move!

715
01:20:03,949 --> 01:20:05,142
Go ahead, go ahead!

716
01:20:05,242 --> 01:20:10,205
You're in, move on!

717
01:20:14,585 --> 01:20:15,527
Come on, you bastard!

718
01:20:15,627 --> 01:20:17,613
Just don't die on me!

719
01:20:17,713 --> 01:20:20,013
Look at me, look at me,
stay awake, stay awake!

720
01:20:21,217 --> 01:20:22,744
Medevac's on it's way!

721
01:20:22,844 --> 01:20:24,913
Captain Davies is sending
over the Third Platoon!

722
01:20:25,013 --> 01:20:27,332
But the Third says the
VC company got past us!

723
01:20:27,432 --> 01:20:29,209
They're headed for the village!

724
01:20:29,309 --> 01:20:31,503
He wants to know if we can stop 'em!

725
01:20:31,603 --> 01:20:33,897
Just get him to an LZ,
get him to an LZ, now!

726
01:21:09,391 --> 01:21:11,502
All right, let's move out!

727
01:21:11,602 --> 01:21:13,921
Let's move out, get back to an LZ!

728
01:21:14,021 --> 01:21:15,464
- Let's move out!
- All right, get him up!

729
01:21:15,564 --> 01:21:16,674
Get him up, let's go!

730
01:21:16,774 --> 01:21:17,775
Let's move!

731
01:21:18,943 --> 01:21:19,844
Got a medevac there?

732
01:21:19,944 --> 01:21:22,696
All right, let's
go, let's go, let's go!

733
01:21:31,539 --> 01:21:33,707
Watch your flank.

734
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:35,484
Shultz!

735
01:21:35,584 --> 01:21:37,670
Spike the red flares for the medevac!

736
01:21:44,301 --> 01:21:46,551
Come on, come on,
get up, men, move your butt!

737
01:21:48,264 --> 01:21:50,916
Come on, come on, let's go!

738
01:21:51,016 --> 01:21:52,127
Come on, go, go, go, go!

739
01:21:52,227 --> 01:21:53,628
Move, move,
move, move, move, move,

740
01:21:53,728 --> 01:21:55,272
move, move, move!

741
01:22:12,289 --> 01:22:14,791
Get down, get down!

742
01:22:34,853 --> 01:22:35,979
Hold 'em up.

743
01:22:37,814 --> 01:22:38,674
All right, sir.

744
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:40,551
- Hands.
- Hands!

745
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:41,886
Where you goin'?

746
01:22:41,986 --> 01:22:43,654
- Come down!
- Come down here!

747
01:22:44,697 --> 01:22:45,723
Come on!

748
01:22:45,823 --> 01:22:47,934
All right, grab him, hold on.

749
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:49,327
Easy.

750
01:22:50,494 --> 01:22:51,812
- Easy!
- Pull 'em up!

751
01:22:51,912 --> 01:22:52,897
Watch his head.

752
01:22:52,997 --> 01:22:53,773
Watch his head!

753
01:22:53,873 --> 01:22:55,750
Come on, pull him up!

754
01:22:56,876 --> 01:22:59,237
All right, he's in.

755
01:22:59,337 --> 01:23:02,131
All right, let's get outta here.

756
01:23:16,937 --> 01:23:17,838
2-6, 2-6,

757
01:23:17,938 --> 01:23:21,108
- do you copy, over?
- Lieutenant, radio!

758
01:23:22,401 --> 01:23:24,555
This is
Eagle 10, we are under attack.

759
01:23:24,655 --> 01:23:26,306
The VC is overrunning the village!

760
01:23:26,406 --> 01:23:27,349
Need reinforcements!

761
01:23:27,449 --> 01:23:28,433
2-6.

762
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:32,980
We are under
heavy attack, advise, over!

763
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,356
Hit 'em with everything you got!

764
01:23:34,456 --> 01:23:36,108
We'll come up on the east side!

765
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:39,027
Okay, come on, let's move out!

766
01:23:39,127 --> 01:23:40,128
Move out!

767
01:25:06,508 --> 01:25:08,786
Spare the villagers!

768
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:11,680
Slaughter any gook carrying a gun!

769
01:25:41,794 --> 01:25:43,003
Hold your fire!

770
01:26:22,919 --> 01:26:24,170
Incoming!

771
01:26:27,131 --> 01:26:28,883
Attain cover!

772
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:38,978
Shultz, get down!

773
01:26:40,354 --> 01:26:41,355
Ah, fuck!

774
01:26:42,857 --> 01:26:45,401
Give us a moment's peace!

775
01:26:55,578 --> 01:26:56,579
Oh!

776
01:26:57,496 --> 01:26:58,856
Oh, ow.

777
01:26:58,956 --> 01:26:59,957
Oh, fuck!

778
01:27:00,833 --> 01:27:01,834
My eye!

779
01:27:08,799 --> 01:27:09,533
Here you go, you're okay.

780
01:27:09,633 --> 01:27:13,554
I got it right here,
I got it right here.

781
01:27:23,356 --> 01:27:24,633
Here you go, hold this right there.

782
01:27:24,733 --> 01:27:25,675
Hold it right on there, that wound.

783
01:27:25,775 --> 01:27:26,775
All right, come on.

784
01:27:47,339 --> 01:27:51,176
I thought it was us they were after!

785
01:28:58,829 --> 01:28:59,830
Hey, LT.

786
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,985
How you feelin', Mac?

787
01:29:05,085 --> 01:29:08,071
Terrific, terrific.

788
01:29:08,171 --> 01:29:10,449
Hell, I'm gonna be back in the
field any day now, you know?

789
01:29:10,549 --> 01:29:14,369
They're gonna give me
some camouflage bandages.

790
01:29:14,469 --> 01:29:15,819
I'm ready to rock and roll.

791
01:29:16,972 --> 01:29:18,265
Watch that lip.

792
01:29:24,021 --> 01:29:25,022
So.

793
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,925
What?

794
01:29:28,025 --> 01:29:29,026
Village?

795
01:29:32,446 --> 01:29:33,739
We lost the village, Mac.

796
01:29:37,994 --> 01:29:39,354
Once they saw they couldn't beat us

797
01:29:39,454 --> 01:29:41,205
to take control of the village,

798
01:29:42,582 --> 01:29:44,532
that's when they decided to destroy it.

799
01:29:46,753 --> 01:29:49,403
No village to fight over,
they didn't need to beat us.

800
01:29:50,965 --> 01:29:53,468
How long is it gonna
take to rebuild it?

801
01:29:54,677 --> 01:29:55,912
We already have.

802
01:29:56,012 --> 01:29:57,012
He He!

803
01:30:03,227 --> 01:30:04,228
You goin' on home?

804
01:30:07,482 --> 01:30:09,592
I don't know what I'm gonna do, Mac.

805
01:30:09,692 --> 01:30:10,426
When I find out what I'm gonna do,

806
01:30:10,526 --> 01:30:14,180
I'm gonna send you a
postcard, let you know.

807
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,348
Hurry Up...

808
01:30:15,448 --> 01:30:17,058
Couple of two, three years

809
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:18,608
you're gonna do another tour.

810
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:21,230
Hey, man.

811
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:22,147
There you go laughing again.

812
01:30:22,247 --> 01:30:24,500
You're gonna split your lip.

813
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,961
You're crazy, you know that?

814
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:30,171
You're crazy.

815
01:30:36,804 --> 01:30:37,805
Funny thing is...

816
01:30:42,601 --> 01:30:45,104
I'm beginning to understand ya.

817
01:30:48,607 --> 01:30:49,650
Hey, kid.

818
01:30:53,445 --> 01:30:57,407
You were a good kid,
that's why your goin' home.

819
01:32:06,353 --> 01:32:07,354
Hey! Mac!

820
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:19,200
Welcome back to the country club.
