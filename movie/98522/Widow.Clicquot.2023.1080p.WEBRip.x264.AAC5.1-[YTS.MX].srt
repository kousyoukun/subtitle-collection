3
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,082
Looking back
on that first day with you,

4
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:42,346
<i>I think I understood immediately</i>

5
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:46,176
<i>why human beings
are compelled to create.</i>

6
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:50,224
<i>Why we must find some way
to lay down our lives,</i>

7
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:52,226
<i>however best we can.</i>

8
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,101
Barbe-Nicole Clicquot,

9
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,060
welcome to the vineyards
of Verzy.

10
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:05,195
The most beautiful
in all of Champagne.

11
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:15,379
It is so
that we might uncover

12
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,034
<i>the secrets of ourselves,</i>

13
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:21,385
<i>better understand
the ones we love.</i>

14
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,561
<i>The time and place
in which we live.</i>

15
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:29,219
<i>And that with any luck,
100 years from now,</i>

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,572
<i>someone will know
that we were here.</i>

17
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:02,078
<i>Can we be a secret?</i>

18
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:08,345
<i>I mean,</i>

19
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:11,783
can we live in a hideaway?

20
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:14,308
Our whole lives,

21
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:15,918
<i>just the two of us.</i>

22
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,792
<i>Kept safe from
the rest of the world.</i>

23
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:26,537
<i>We can try...</i>

24
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,322
Not hidden from each other though.

25
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:37,069
So, do you agree to be
my Emilie?

26
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:41,987
Who is Emilie?

27
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,558
The woman

28
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,169
<i>Voltaire was
a true partner to...</i>

29
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:05,881
<i>The love of his life.</i>

30
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:39,393
<i>It seems impossible</i>

31
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,004
<i>that anything will ever
grow here again.</i>

32
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,010
<i>A great hush has settled
across the vines.</i>

33
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,841
<i>Your absence
clings to everything.</i>

34
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,066
I fear your
father blames me, privately,

35
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:03,460
<i>for all that has happened.</i>

36
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,636
<i>And I fear that I might too.</i>

37
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:18,867
Where is Clem?

38
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,956
You didn't find her?

39
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:27,223
Madame.-Madame.

40
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,573
My heartfelt condolences, Madame.

41
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,967
As neighbors, we feel your loss
alongside you.

42
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,360
- Thank you.
- Madame,

43
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,492
I wonder if I might
walk the vineyards,

44
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,015
to remember François.

45
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:40,062
Of course, Monsieur Moeët.
It's very kind.

46
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:53,989
Those beautiful slopes will
always remind me of him.

47
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,121
Yes.

48
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:58,907
I am going to walk the terraces
on my way home.

49
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:05,217
There you are.

50
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:06,828
Oh, Clem.

51
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,362
Clem?

52
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,998
It will be
just the two of us now.

53
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,002
But we have each other.

54
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,444
We have each other, my darling.

55
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,622
<i>And what do you smell?</i>

56
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:09,543
Floral. Like our rose garden...

57
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:12,023
in June, after a rain shower.

58
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,770
And burning leaves.

59
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:22,033
- Mm-hm.
- And twigs.

60
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:25,210
An apple orchard when the trees
are at their tallest...

61
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:29,171
What do you think
about blending these two?

62
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,390
It could be quite...
- No... not together.

63
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,916
Or do you want more acidity?

64
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,051
You did want me to
speak my mind.

65
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:45,840
Yes. Foolishly.

66
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,103
Please do not learn
as quickly as your mother,

67
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,410
because I want to be able
to teach you something.

68
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,501
<i>One little something.</i>

69
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,336
Madame?

70
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,906
There will be a meeting downstairs

71
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,779
that Phillipe
would like you to attend.

72
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,694
A meeting?

73
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,957
Evidently, Paquet has
drawn up a contract

74
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,828
for the sale of the hectares.

75
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,531
Is it true?

76
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,097
Barbe-Nicole,
let me put your mind at ease.

77
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:28,491
I want you and Clementine
to live comfortably,

78
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:31,363
without any worry at all.

79
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:32,974
Thank you.

80
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:35,455
Monsieur Paquet here has
secured a very handsome offer

81
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,065
for the property from Moeët.

82
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,154
Afternoon.

83
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:46,553
I appreciate your... kindness.

84
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:50,382
But out of concern
for François' vines,

85
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:54,735
I will be continuing
to care for them myself.

86
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,650
Wine is a very difficult
vocation, my dear.

87
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,173
You underestimate what
it will require of you.

88
00:07:58,303 --> 00:07:59,870
I know what it requires.

89
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,525
I've been in the fields
for years.

90
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,440
As a partner with François, Madame.

91
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,528
Not alone.

92
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,443
It is not your place, Madame.

93
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:10,141
I cannot allow you
to go to your ruin.

94
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:15,233
Come back to Reims with me.

95
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,453
Could you and I
speak alone, Phillipe?

96
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,109
Yes, of course.

97
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,385
Have you seen those beautiful
purples and reds

98
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,256
this year, Phillipe?

99
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:43,566
Is their climb not the best
we have had yet?

100
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,136
Those are
François Clicquot grapes,

101
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,791
and his dream
is living in them.

102
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,320
You risk losing everything
by staying here.

103
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,801
Do you think that is what
François would have wanted?

104
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,454
François willed the vines to me

105
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:05,545
because he knew
I would never sell.

106
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,285
I will be using my own savings

107
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,113
to cover
the vineyard's expenses.

108
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,419
You have not heard me, my dear.

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,986
Have you not heard me?

110
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:18,035
Those are François' vines,

111
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,994
and you want to sell them.

112
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:50,154
Paquet? Droite?

113
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:59,642
Gentlemen, we will not sell.

114
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,297
Barbe-Nicole will continue here
for the time being.

115
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,691
If I may, sir... I think...

116
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:06,562
No, Paquet. You may not.

117
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,001
That is all.

118
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:36,853
I have come to sing to them
since I was a boy.

119
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,463
It's supposed to
make them strong.

120
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,554
You try.

121
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,775
- No.
- Go on!

122
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,168
I can't!

123
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:48,473
They need it.

124
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:52,739
They need you.

125
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,303
They like you.

126
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,044
They do?

127
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,310
They think you're perfect.

128
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,899
We'll take Clem
with us today,

129
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,076
out of this sad house.

130
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,774
<i>It's our home.</i>

131
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,602
<i>Clem wants to stay with me.</i>

132
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,214
Barbe, you must think of her.

133
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,695
No sense in keeping her
out of the abbey

134
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,566
to help you
with your grief, my dear.

135
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:23,873
She should be with friends
to help her with hers.

136
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,396
Thank you, Mother.

137
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,532
You didn't know him, Mother.

138
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:37,452
He was not just
someone's first love.

139
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,883
<i>My darling Emilie,</i>

140
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,406
<i>I felt compelled
to write to you</i>

141
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:20,408
<i>this glorious summer morning</i>

142
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:22,932
<i>to let you know that I think
we might have found it.</i>

143
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:29,983
<i>The secret
to perfect happiness.</i>

144
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:35,205
<i>With each day, my love for you
grows stronger, fiercer.</i>

145
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:39,209
<i>It drenches me the way
the sun drenches the vines.</i>

146
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,256
<i>I am certain
of nothing in this life</i>

147
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,868
<i>but the fact of your strength.</i>

148
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:51,439
<i>I am hopelessly,
unequivocally yours.</i>

149
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,315
Madame, Mr. Edouard Werler.

150
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:01,362
He has come from the offices of
Mr. Phillipe Clicquot in Reims.

151
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,758
Good day, Mr. Werler.

152
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,543
Good day, Madame.

153
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:09,892
Your father-in-law has sent me

154
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,460
with the financial record
of the vineyard.

155
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,766
He wants you to be apprised
of your situation.

156
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,725
I apologize for coming
without warning.

157
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,946
Please.

158
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,732
I am to take them back with me.

159
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,821
Are you a clerk at his office?

160
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,214
I am, Madame.

161
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,258
In accounts.

162
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,698
Will you assist me?

163
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:34,830
If you'd like.

164
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:42,794
The first column
is expenditures,

165
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,797
the second is profits,
the third losses,

166
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,626
and the fourth
projected earnings.

167
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,541
Because of the loss
of the last harvest,

168
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:53,414
there were expenditures
but no profit.

169
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:55,895
The next harvest
will only recoup that loss.

170
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,723
And the truth is,

171
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:02,379
your competition will monopolize
the market in France, Madame...

172
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,903
if no one can sell abroad

173
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,905
due to Napoleon's embargoes
against his enemies.

174
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,258
So you will not sell
next year either.

175
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,482
Thank you.

176
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,659
Will you thank Phillipe for me?

177
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,837
And tell him that I insisted
upon keeping the ledgers.

178
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,188
Uh...

179
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,711
Madame.

180
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,682
You said there
would be a profit by this year.

181
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,336
The new planting
has not yielded.

182
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:49,035
Yes, sir,
I apologize for overstating.

183
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,993
Many of your experiments...

184
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,690
- Innovations...
- have floundered!

185
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,257
How do we know?!

186
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,782
How do we know?

187
00:15:57,913 --> 00:16:00,655
It's too soon...

188
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:03,092
It's too soon to know, Father...
these are radical ideas.

189
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:09,403
And there is decent improvement
this year,

190
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,927
even with the excessive heat.

191
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,407
You can't just keep endlessly

192
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,887
experimenting without results.

193
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,629
Perhaps it's time
to admit defeat now.

194
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,283
François!

195
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,360
Droite never walks the fields.

196
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,189
He doesn't know the vines.
He doesn't know what they need.

197
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,932
He doesn't want to nurture them.

198
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,980
He doesn't
understand how complex they are.

199
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,809
He doesn't love them.

200
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,596
This is the transfor... What?

201
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:13,815
Transformative?

202
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,600
Moment for them?

203
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,039
Yes.

204
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:27,002
I am afraid for the vineyard
if anyone else manages it.

205
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:32,486
They have no right, interrupting...

206
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,314
Well...
he is the estate manager;

207
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,880
therefore, he thinks
he has the right.

208
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:44,454
But you, you are the one
with the vision,

209
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:48,980
and the talent,
to change things.

210
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,724
You will change things.

211
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,488
You're always in the vineyard.

212
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,448
And I like having you
in the vineyard with me.

213
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:24,451
And I like having you
in the house with me, Mother.

214
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,673
Will you cut flowers
with me then?

215
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,197
I like the pink ones,

216
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,200
and the white ones,
and the yellow ones!

217
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,551
<i>As ever, the quiet prevails.</i>

218
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,553
<i>A new loneliness presses in,</i>

219
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:42,121
<i>but I will continue
the work you started.</i>

220
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,603
<i>Louis Boone
will arrive at noon.</i>

221
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,953
<i>I welcome
a friendly face at last.</i>

222
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:56,787
<i>Tomorrow I face the workers alone,</i>

223
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,442
<i>for the first time.</i>

224
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,141
<i>Give me strength, my love.</i>

225
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,794
<i>Give me strength.</i>

226
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,583
First, the new vines
will be planted

227
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:12,412
in a north-south configuration.

228
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:20,246
The upper slope will be
pulled up and turned.

229
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,161
Uhm...

230
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,945
Droite...

231
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,513
do you have an opinion?

232
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,471
Yes I do, Madame.

233
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,604
These fields do not need replanting,

234
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,780
reconfiguring,
or starting over again.

235
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,042
I disagree.

236
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,000
Water is collecting
at the roots.

237
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:38,394
The rain is good for
the vines, Madame.

238
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:39,743
They need to struggle.

239
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,050
- Struggle?
- When they struggle to survive,

240
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,879
they become more deeply reliant
on their own strength.

241
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:49,753
They become more of
what they are meant to be.

242
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:53,366
Mr. Muller, where do we think
we could find premium glass?

243
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,150
We have glass in stock, Madame.

244
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,283
I want quality glass
without defects.

245
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,372
We can't afford to lose
another vintage.

246
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:03,114
We were meant to buy
premium glass, Madame.

247
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,030
But your husband
decided to save money.

248
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:09,425
Monsieur Bohne will attest
to the dangers in that.

249
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:12,907
And if Muller is out searching
for glass, which is my job,

250
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,909
who is going to run the fields,
which is his?

251
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,309
Because you have not
done this before,

252
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,833
I cannot blame you
for not understanding

253
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:28,618
how a vineyard is run.

254
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:31,230
Without a strict adherence
to hierarchy,

255
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,232
there is chaos,

256
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,408
anarchy.

257
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:38,019
I don't see it as a hierarchy.

258
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,716
What do you see it as?

259
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:43,154
A wheel. A circle.

260
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,548
We are sitting together
at the table.

261
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,551
We will trade ideas, including
everyone in the decision.

262
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,250
You make it sound like
a dinner party.

263
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,036
These are mine
and my husband's ideas.

264
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,127
He thinks I'm inept.

265
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,477
Are you seeking his approval?

266
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,610
If Phillipe listens to him,
I might need to have it.

267
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,699
But I was asking you:

268
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,702
Are you seeking his approval,
regardless of Phillipe?

269
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:15,535
It appears he plans to
undermine you with the workers.

270
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,928
But I could see
they are loyal to you.

271
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,717
What do you think?
Am I inept?

272
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:28,548
Well, he's right
about some things.

273
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,725
The wheel
is a beautiful notion,

274
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:33,944
but it's destined to fail.

275
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:37,121
If you are not willing
to dictate without hesitation,

276
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:41,387
you may lose the respect
of the men working under you.

277
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,693
You make them uncomfortable.

278
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:48,263
You undermine a system
that they have confidence in.

279
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,786
If you are unforgiving
of their mistakes,

280
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,788
they might even idolize you.

281
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,880
I do admire you,

282
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:02,756
trying to
run things as you want,

283
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:05,367
as a woman would.

284
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:10,154
So the ability to listen
to others, to collaborate,

285
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,460
is not a sign of strength?

286
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:15,508
No.

287
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:17,684
It might not ever be.

288
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:20,208
François would not agree.

289
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,689
Maybe not, but he was
an enlightened soul,

290
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:25,213
and we have been living
under monarchs for too long.

291
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,216
And Napoleon is even worse.

292
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,219
Do you respect tyrants?

293
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,003
Do I respect tyrants?

294
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,877
Well, I have been known to
fancy a brute or two,

295
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:39,358
and it has been said
I could use a little discipline.

296
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,577
So hierarchy comforts you.

297
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:45,276
And I must give up
my idea of the wheel

298
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,889
because it makes men uncomfortable.

299
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,587
Because it doesn't
project power.

300
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,985
There is something
I want to show you.

301
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,643
Amsterdam,
St Petersburg, Moscow...

302
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:06,776
If Napoleon's
embargoes are still a problem,

303
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,039
I want to stay ahead of him.

304
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,345
Of Napoleon?

305
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,739
Mm-hm.

306
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,610
So, you're a criminal at heart?

307
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:18,048
These borders are arbitrary,
and they could keep changing.

308
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,878
Why not begin a trade
that ignores unrest, wars,

309
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,402
that exists on its own?

310
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,752
Stateless, around the globe?

311
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,107
If you choose
not to distribute for me...

312
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,762
My dear, if I choose not to
distribute for you,

313
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:37,938
you won't find anyone who will.

314
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:39,374
And if I decline your offer,

315
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:42,725
you must never tell anyone
of this plan.

316
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,510
Not a soul.

317
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,563
It's dark.

318
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,087
It's very hard to tell
who anyone is

319
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:01,135
in a bed that large,
so I investigate it.

320
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:03,920
The hair is soft...
the body hard!

321
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,269
No, please...

322
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:09,012
Emilie! Come, please.

323
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:10,623
May I introduce Louis Bohne,

324
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:12,799
perhaps the greatest
wine salesman in all the world.

325
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,281
Madame.

326
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,588
- Welcome.
- I read her Voltaire,

327
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,460
but these are...
- Please, please, darling!

328
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,070
her love letters to me.

329
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,813
The sunnier the climate,
the more aromatic the berries,

330
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:30,381
but there is a limit.

331
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:34,081
Actually,
there is nothing more

332
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:37,301
loving someone
could write to me.

333
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:41,175
My true equal,
my partner in everything.

334
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,700
And what of Voltaire
is your favorite, François?

335
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:48,443
God is a comedian
who plays to an audience...

336
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:49,792
that is too afraid to laugh!

337
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:55,058
And you, Emilie,
what is your favorite?

338
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,847
I should like to lie
at your feet

339
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,501
and die in your arms.

340
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,027
I love you.

341
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:15,383
It is
too soon for you to leave!

342
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:18,473
I know.

343
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:20,562
But I must go.

344
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:25,132
Happy hunting!

345
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:50,418
François's last effort.

346
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:54,074
It's from one of the bottles
that survived the loss.

347
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:01,037
This mix is mine alone.

348
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:02,865
It's something
I have been developing.

349
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,608
Sir.

350
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,350
Droite.

351
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,310
What did you use?

352
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:16,009
The pinot noir,
and I left the skin on.

353
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,489
And the red?

354
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,361
I would sell it to
a maker of inferior wine.

355
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:22,058
But Madame...

356
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:26,149
we thought the red
must be our first offering.

357
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,414
It's what the buyers have
come to expect of this region.

358
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,939
And what grape
do you favor, Madame?

359
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:40,033
I favor a more powerful,
intense, and precise grape

360
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,817
than most of the makers
in the region.

361
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,079
Why?

362
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,168
I want the drinker
to feel as if

363
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,041
they stand
in the vineyard in Verzy,

364
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:51,435
as if they are tasting
the place itself.

365
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:57,006
The more intense,
the more precise the grape,

366
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,878
the more they can...

367
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,406
experience François'
unique contribution.

368
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:15,068
You have done well, deciding
to sell off the red.

369
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:20,160
And I would continue developing
the pink champagne

370
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,727
with the skin on.

371
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:24,077
The pink is weak,
Monsieur. It is too dry.

372
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:27,123
Yes, well,
your job is to count the vines.

373
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:30,431
It most certainly is not to
judge the quality of the mix,

374
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,563
nor is it to sell the champagne,

375
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:37,481
which would be my job,
would it not?

376
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,266
In the hierarchy?

377
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:42,965
Yes, Monsieur.

378
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:53,802
I will sell
the widow's champagne,

379
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:55,717
provided the final tasting
goes well.

380
00:27:55,848 --> 00:28:00,200
In say, a year.

381
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,986
I will see you and your
criminal enterprise then.

382
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,150
<i>There is hope.</i>

383
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,761
<i>A way forward,
however unpredictable.</i>

384
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:47,726
<i>We can dance around the
petulant games of powerful men,</i>

385
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:52,643
<i>but... as ever, we are
at the mercy of the seasons.</i>

386
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,215
<i>At last, my love, spring.</i>

387
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:00,826
<i>The first...</i>

388
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:01,696
<i>...buds break.</i>

389
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,656
<i>A hot, dry, July.</i>

390
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:08,790
As the land
holds its breath

391
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,705
<i>for the harvest ahead.</i>

392
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:12,402
<i>We wait in anticipation.</i>

393
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:20,889
<i>François, your last song has
sung the grapes to good health.</i>

394
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:28,854
<i>All senses feel heightened.</i>

395
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:31,117
<i>Every moment matters.</i>

396
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,249
The time
of day the grapes are picked.

397
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,471
<i>The way they're handled.
The first press.</i>

398
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:39,821
<i>Wish I could bottle this time.</i>

399
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:43,216
It is
a haphazard sort of alchemy.

400
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,133
<i>I want our champagne to have</i>

401
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:50,223
<i>structure, depth.</i>

402
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:52,573
It must
reflect your elegance.

403
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,750
<i>Your boldness.</i>

404
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,230
<i>Your light.</i>

405
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:03,323
But I don't
want to go to the
abbey, Mother.

406
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:06,326
I don't
want you to go either.

407
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:10,896
The vineyard
is no place for a little girl.

408
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:14,203
The vineyard
is no place for you.

409
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:15,988
I know.

410
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,991
This will always be your home.

411
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,819
We belong to it.

412
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:56,202
Morning, Barbe.

413
00:30:56,332 --> 00:31:00,206
Morning.

414
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:02,034
Will you leave it?

415
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:03,774
I'd like to do it.

416
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:12,566
It's ready for Louis.

417
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:20,052
So what is it, Barbe?

418
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:26,536
François should have
been here today.

419
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:37,721
Thank you.

420
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:43,292
<i>Happy birthday, my love.</i>

421
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,343
Thank you.

422
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,736
They are to keep a record
of your... discoveries.

423
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:58,917
They are beautiful.

424
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,570
Louis helped me choose them.

425
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:06,054
You like him.

426
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:07,882
Hm?

427
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,711
Yes. I do.

428
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:13,888
I see the way you are
with one another.

429
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,588
Are you jealous?-No.

430
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,330
Why not?

431
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,115
Because I know you love me.

432
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:29,686
And because I believe
we must be free to feel

433
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:31,123
whatever we feel,

434
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:33,560
so that we never mistake
rebellion for reality.

435
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,520
Because I like his company too.

436
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,610
You like his company?

437
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:41,829
I do.

438
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,968
It was too warm this summer.

439
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,755
And if the rain this winter
is anything like last year...

440
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,546
So we adapt.

441
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,375
I was thinking,

442
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:09,813
perhaps we could help the vines
better this year.

443
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,514
It's an improvement.

444
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:01,039
There's character there.

445
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,566
It's not ready.

446
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:08,046
I'm going to continue mixing.

447
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,612
Bottle it.

448
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:12,528
It's time for
the second fermentation.

449
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,053
And leave it a few months,

450
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:19,840
unless you prefer
the frog-eyed bigger bubbles.

451
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,626
No,
I prefer the smaller bubbles.

452
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:33,549
Madame,
George Christian von Kessler.

453
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,942
Are you married, George?

454
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,859
I will be interviewing you;
pay him no mind.

455
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,470
I really just want to
know one thing.

456
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:44,430
How many women
are in your family?

457
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,127
My mother and my sister, Madame.

458
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:49,174
What do your mother
and sister think of me?

459
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,959
They worry a woman
might not be a capable manager.

460
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,353
What did you say to that?

461
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,572
I said, "Aren't you able?

462
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,705
Here in your home.

463
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:01,403
Why shouldn't she be in hers?"

464
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,318
I know you are
in your fields every day.

465
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,668
You work hard, Madame.

466
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:09,672
Do you want the position
of a field foreman?

467
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,109
Foreman?

468
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,893
Yes.

469
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,677
Will the older staff
listen to me?

470
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:16,766
If you prove yourself.

471
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:19,465
I have to prove myself
every day.

472
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,031
Madame.

473
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:24,383
He'll need new clothes
if they're to respect him.

474
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:27,429
Anne is an excellent tailor.

475
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,128
Thank you.

476
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:38,005
Edouard! Come in.

477
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,616
Louis Bohne, the famous.

478
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:43,010
Hello. Pleasure.
Truly a pleasure.

479
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,055
Louis, this is Edouard Werler.

480
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,579
He is a gifted accountant.

481
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,102
Mm.

482
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:52,628
Yes.
Well, I will leave you to it.

483
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:55,979
I can see you know exactly what
sort of man you are looking for.

484
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,590
I am to town.

485
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,637
Happy hunting!

486
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:09,950
<i>Finally, after too many months</i>

487
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,952
<i>of bottling,</i>

488
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:13,606
<i>no more frog-eyed bubbles.</i>

489
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,482
<i>The trade route
has been finalized.</i>

490
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,354
<i>The delivery negotiated.</i>

491
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:26,314
<i>So many obstacles ahead.</i>

492
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,186
<i>So much at stake.</i>

493
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:30,362
<i>Mustn't dwell on
what we cannot control.</i>

494
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,368
<i>Though, it seems a shame
not to dress you.</i>

495
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:38,283
<i>Something must announce you.</i>

496
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:42,678
<i>Something subtle, but smart.</i>

497
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,595
<i>Confident.</i>

498
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:48,206
<i>There.</i>

499
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:51,121
<i>That will keep you safe
across the seas.</i>

500
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,211
<i>Go well, my loves, go well.</i>

501
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,913
All dressed up
and ready to travel.

502
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:04,222
We will take a few days
to circumvent the front lines

503
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:05,919
and arrive in Amsterdam.

504
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:12,882
I'll be gone a while.

505
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:16,843
If I don't come back,
don't alert the authorities.

506
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,672
For you, for the journey.

507
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,239
Thank you.

508
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,857
Let's go!

509
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:33,599
<i>And now the wait.</i>

510
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:37,342
<i>For the first time in
as long as I can remember,</i>

511
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:41,476
<i>I am permitting myself excitement.</i>

512
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:44,262
<i>Pure, unbridled excitement.</i>

513
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:50,224
Good morning, Phillipe.

514
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:52,313
I hope you are well.

515
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:53,619
Barbe,
I came to view the product

516
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:54,794
but it is nowhere to be found.

517
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:56,056
Why do you need to see it?

518
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:57,449
Where is it?

519
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,803
We moved the sparkling.

520
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:09,199
Come with me.

521
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:15,728
Are you selling abroad?

522
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:18,992
Barbe,
whether you tell me or not,

523
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,124
if you break this embargo
and you are found out,

524
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:24,780
I will be implicated.

525
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:27,957
Everything must be reported
to Droite and to myself.

526
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,003
We are partners.

527
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,527
When I have proceeds,
I will send them to you.

528
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,707
You understand our arrangement
can be terminated.

529
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,100
You have one last chance.

530
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,580
One.

531
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,931
<i>There is a comet</i>

532
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:48,108
<i>burning a passage
through the sky,</i>

533
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:50,023
<i>day and night.</i>

534
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:53,374
<i>The world watches as one.</i>

535
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:58,379
<i>Whispers around Champagne
say it is portent of change.</i>

536
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,340
<i>A good omen perhaps,
for the coming harvest.</i>

537
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,993
Madame! Come quick!

538
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:05,517
First press!
- I'm coming!

539
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,658
It's perfect!

540
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:27,060
Whoa.

541
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,283
Where is Louis?

542
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,897
Louis stayed to sell the glass.

543
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:39,594
I'm sorry, Madame.

544
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:42,467
We made it to Amsterdam but...

545
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,730
the heat and the journey...

546
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,253
the champagne spoiled.

547
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,125
We lost everything...

548
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,481
Sorry, Madame.

549
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,305
We could offer
to sell some of the hectares.

550
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,699
The Moeëts inquiring again?

551
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:44,006
They made it clear
there is a standing offer.

552
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:47,575
For all of it,
or some of the fields, if...

553
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:51,318
When. When I fail.

554
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:56,497
I understand.

555
00:40:56,628 --> 00:41:01,589
Perhaps in the event
that I should be so foolish,

556
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:08,204
so arrogant, to send
the sparkling around a blockade

557
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:09,771
and lose it all to the heat.

558
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:11,164
To bad luck, certainly.

559
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,296
To bad judgement on my part.

560
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:15,081
I'm not sure
all the responsibility

561
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:17,083
lies on your should--
- It was my decision.

562
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:19,259
And you will be the reason
we succeed in the end!

563
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:22,305
We have no money.

564
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:23,959
I cannot pay any of you.

565
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:31,619
Do you think Louis
intends to continue on with us?

566
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,318
You, Edouard?

567
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:40,280
We need to get to the bottling
stage of this vintage.

568
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,151
We cannot wait too long
to tell Phillipe.

569
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,634
<i>Selling off objects</i>

570
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:51,160
<i>to make up for the
lost shipment
in Amsterdam.</i>

571
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:55,251
<i>But I have kept
Clem's room untouched.</i>

572
00:41:55,382 --> 00:42:00,343
<i>Try again. Think differently.</i>

573
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:04,217
<i>Work on what's in front of us.</i>

574
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:55,964
This is for you...

575
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:04,843
It's not very good, is it?
But I did make it myself.

576
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:12,764
It's an owl, weeping
in a cathedral on the moon...

577
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,031
Beautiful.

578
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,821
You were disappointed when...

579
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:29,258
you first saw me, I know.

580
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:34,263
When your parents told you
that you were to marry.

581
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,055
I will try to make it up to you.

582
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,928
Come on lads, let's go!

583
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,495
Get more wood.-Thank you!

584
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:50,584
If we lose these
first shoots to a late frost,

585
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:51,759
we lose the harvest.

586
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,456
I know.

587
00:43:53,587 --> 00:43:55,023
I'll keep these fires lit
till morning.

588
00:43:55,154 --> 00:43:56,590
I'll stay.

589
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:58,157
No one can fall asleep.

590
00:43:58,287 --> 00:43:59,419
Of course, Madame.

591
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:00,507
Thank you, George.

592
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,553
All right, lads, let's go!

593
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:05,860
Muller! Muller! Here!

594
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,122
Come on, boys!

595
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:08,515
up the hill as well, lads.

596
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,864
Here. Follow me.

597
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,431
Come on! Follow me there!

598
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:25,445
Pick these up.
Pick these up now!

599
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,360
Why?

600
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,579
Time does not bend, Father.

601
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,320
She's slow!
- Go and clean yourself up.

602
00:44:31,451 --> 00:44:32,800
- It must clear!
- Meet me in the study.

603
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,236
Come and speak to me

604
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:37,457
when you are ready
to discuss things civilly.

605
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:41,504
I am afraid there is nothing
to be done about François.

606
00:44:57,129 --> 00:44:59,218
Hello, Phillipe.

607
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:01,176
Thank you for coming.

608
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:03,265
Of course.

609
00:45:03,396 --> 00:45:07,835
Edouard, would you like to...
to begin?

610
00:45:07,966 --> 00:45:10,359
Yes.

611
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:14,189
Phillipe,
regarding the missing product,

612
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,061
we wanted to assure you
there will be no legal issues

613
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:18,933
for the vineyard.

614
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:20,239
There will be no evidence

615
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:22,197
of the shipment
having been sold anywhere.

616
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,634
But how can you guarantee that?
There must be records.

617
00:45:26,419 --> 00:45:29,161
It was ruined in the heat.

618
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:32,207
It's lost?!

619
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:33,121
The entire vintage?

620
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:34,557
Yes.

621
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:38,431
Edouard, you may go.

622
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:56,884
God!
I am very disappointed in you.

623
00:45:57,015 --> 00:45:58,059
- I understand.
- You've confirmed

624
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,060
all my worst fears.
- I understand,

625
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:00,496
but I want you to consider

626
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,629
not removing me
until after this next bottling.

627
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,110
And why would I do that?

628
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,111
And if we can recoup...

629
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:07,590
No. It is finished.

630
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:28,786
François needed help,

631
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,527
and we failed to recognize it.

632
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:34,443
We failed him.

633
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:38,534
That is why he is dead.

634
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:43,017
I could never allow myself
to think...

635
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,114
Please, Phillipe.

636
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:56,814
While the vineyard
still bears his name.

637
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:15,441
If Louis Bohne distributes, agreed.

638
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:58,049
The damp will get
into your bones, Barbe.

639
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:59,746
You'll catch your death.

640
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,316
Sit with me.

641
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,078
That's very good.

642
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,776
Just isn't good enough.

643
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,691
You need to sleep.

644
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:48,795
It's not right. It's not good.

645
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,538
This isn't right.
It's not good.

646
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:55,280
This is not good!

647
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,629
That is too loud!

648
00:48:56,759 --> 00:49:00,111
It's too loud, it's too loud!

649
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:01,547
We are not safe here!

650
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:03,070
- Clem? Clem!
- This is our home!

651
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:04,332
Inside! Go!

652
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:06,508
Go inside!

653
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:12,123
It's loud, it's too loud.

654
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:13,602
Taste it!

655
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:16,954
Would they have their own homes
suffer such harm?

656
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:18,303
Why is no one coming to help?

657
00:49:22,307 --> 00:49:25,832
Barbe!

658
00:49:58,212 --> 00:50:01,694
Where were you?

659
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:03,565
Hiding...

660
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:06,568
You're hiding from me...

661
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:08,353
I was waiting for you to calm.

662
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:11,356
I can't.

663
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:13,619
Will Clem be safe?

664
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:16,622
If you can't calm.

665
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:19,755
If I can't, will that keep you
from loving me?

666
00:51:24,037 --> 00:51:25,691
Monsieur Louis Bohne.

667
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:28,259
Louis Bohne, after months
on a horse.

668
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:29,651
Charles has told me

669
00:51:29,782 --> 00:51:31,175
you are maintaining
the vineyards yourself.

670
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:33,351
You must be the only woman
I know who loves mud.

671
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:36,745
Yes, well,
we keep moving forward.

672
00:51:36,876 --> 00:51:39,705
And what criminal activities
do you have in mind for us next?

673
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:42,447
They are not so much criminal

674
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:47,016
as they are masking the extent
to which we are truly solvent.

675
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:51,673
Excellent.

676
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:54,241
You've been gone a long while.

677
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,764
Yes.

678
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:59,551
It's good to have you
back with us safe, Louis.

679
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:02,336
And I have control
of the vineyard

680
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:05,034
until the next bottling,

681
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:09,474
if you decide
to distribute for us.

682
00:52:09,604 --> 00:52:10,779
After that...

683
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,956
I know.

684
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:15,828
Phillipe told me.

685
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:25,925
After the disaster in Amsterdam,

686
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:30,234
I managed to salvage
eight bottles.

687
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:34,238
I then rode on horseback
to St. Petersburg.

688
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:37,197
A friend,
who has exquisite taste,

689
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:38,720
and is the sort who likes

690
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:41,288
the boast of his new discoveries,

691
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:43,812
he sampled your champagne.

692
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:45,510
I gave him the bottles,

693
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,905
and he gave me this.

694
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:53,735
In advance of the next shipment.

695
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,999
You have sold, Madame.

696
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,654
Congratulations.

697
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:01,526
Provided the next tasting
goes well, of course;

698
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:03,441
we have to match
the same standard of

699
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:05,356
what we have already pre-sold.

700
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:06,661
Of course.

701
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:15,975
For Phillipe.

702
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:19,631
And for you.

703
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:24,636
No.

704
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:26,464
I will give this to Phillipe.

705
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,599
It did occur to me
that I might sell the red wine

706
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:34,341
to the nobles that I know
in Austria.

707
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:36,735
They hate the French,
but not me personally, I hope.

708
00:53:42,436 --> 00:53:44,873
To dislike you
would be against nature.

709
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,009
We sold the red.

710
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:51,880
Not at the price
you would have sold it for,

711
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:54,622
but I needed to pay the workers
for the harvest.

712
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,145
Louis, could you...?

713
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:02,456
Would one of your royals buy it?

714
00:54:02,587 --> 00:54:04,980
It's the only possession
of worth I have left.

715
00:54:15,687 --> 00:54:17,384
If I had anything of my own
to sell, I would.

716
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:19,517
I know, but you don't.

717
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:25,566
No.

718
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,718
We won't be solvent until
after the next vintage.

719
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:48,241
I know.

720
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:52,289
But you have sold, Barbe.

721
00:54:54,203 --> 00:54:55,727
And Phillipe will soon see that.

722
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:01,428
Don't sell it quite yet.

723
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:33,068
All right, that's enough.

724
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,505
Louis.

725
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:07,842
Is that you, Barbe-Nicole?

726
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,522
What do you want, Barbe?

727
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:40,527
Your instincts
have always been so good.

728
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,969
You know what I am.

729
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:53,540
Why won't you
listen to yourself now?

730
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:55,194
I don't want to.

731
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,765
Why?

732
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:03,028
I don't want to.

733
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:35,800
Will you ask the workers

734
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:38,672
if they would accept these
in trade?

735
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:39,673
I will, Barbe.

736
00:59:01,363 --> 00:59:03,365
What would Voltaire say?

737
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,897
He would not be happy with me.

738
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:16,596
What are you praying for?

739
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:25,649
To... stop...
loving you this much.

740
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:40,315
It... it's...

741
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:48,585
you are the only.

742
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:54,678
You are life...

743
00:59:58,029 --> 00:59:59,421
for me.

744
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:02,947
And...

745
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,690
I...

746
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:13,435
I'm not...

747
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:22,619
I'm not.

748
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:25,622
I'm not.

749
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,858
No, no.
For my calm, for my sleep.

750
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,340
Don't hide from me, love.

751
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:58,437
Oh. Oh... darling. Clemy...

752
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:04,312
Silly Daddy. Silly Daddy.

753
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:05,836
I've got you. I've got you.

754
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:07,228
I want Mummy!

755
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:09,927
Oh, I've got you. I've got you.
I've got you.

756
01:01:10,057 --> 01:01:10,928
Darling.

757
01:01:11,058 --> 01:01:11,929
Stop.

758
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:13,104
Stop!

759
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,241
It's all right.

760
01:03:12,397 --> 01:03:16,009
Napoleon's new regulations
on planting.

761
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,446
When does he find the time?

762
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:22,581
He understands the value
of peace.

763
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:24,539
He is not interested in peace.

764
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:39,163
I'm working.

765
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:41,513
It's late. Everyone's asleep.

766
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:53,090
Now get out of my office.

767
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:18,811
<i>I shall name you</i>

768
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:22,249
<i>the Comet Vintage of 1811.</i>

769
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:28,516
Monsieur Muller,
Monsieur Muller.

770
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,083
Quick. It's time!
- Gather everyone!

771
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:31,693
Sir, I'll ready the horses.

772
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:35,828
Right! I need
all the carts loaded.

773
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,396
All the horses!
We need everyone.

774
01:04:38,526 --> 01:04:40,224
Everyone to the caves!

775
01:04:40,354 --> 01:04:41,355
Now!

776
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:51,191
At least another dozen
bottles over there.

777
01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:07,077
You need to hide here
until the soldiers have gone.

778
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,992
They won't find you
in the caves.

779
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,733
Muller, go and get your family
once you're finished loading,

780
01:05:11,864 --> 01:05:12,734
and any of the other men.

781
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:13,822
- Sir.
- No, no.

782
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:15,433
I need Muller to bring Clem.

783
01:05:15,563 --> 01:05:17,826
She'll be safer at your
parents' house in Reims, Madame.

784
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:18,958
I must go to the house
to get Anne.

785
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:20,612
Wait.

786
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:23,223
Go quickly, the Russians
could be here before sunset.

787
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:25,008
God knows what will happen.

788
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:27,401
Leave the shipment
if anything happens.

789
01:05:27,532 --> 01:05:29,360
Go. Don't worry, go!

790
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:32,841
Go. Keep to the woods.

791
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,850
Come on, keep loading!

792
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:04,961
- It's here!
- I know, I know!

793
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:07,833
- Clem!
- We have to hurry.

794
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,574
I need Clem. Oh god!

795
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:11,663
Oh my god, oh my god!

796
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:22,717
Barbe, Barbe!

797
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,785
<i>The war is over,</i>

798
01:06:46,915 --> 01:06:50,354
<i>leaving such devastation
in its wake.</i>

799
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:54,967
<i>And yet no damage done
to the vineyards of France.</i>

800
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:58,014
<i>A miracle.</i>

801
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:00,016
My dear,

802
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:03,454
<i>now that Napoleon has been
brought to his knees,</i>

803
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:06,370
<i>all of Russia wishes to
celebrate the end of this war</i>

804
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,721
<i>by drinking the Comet.</i>

805
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:13,638
<i>Your champagne is all sold.
I wish I had more to sell.</i>

806
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:15,727
I've been
turning the vessels each day

807
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:18,077
<i>over the last few weeks.</i>

808
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:23,691
<i>And as I thought, sediment
has solidified in the base,</i>

809
01:07:23,822 --> 01:07:25,998
<i>ready to be released.</i>

810
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:28,783
The Czar himself
said he would drink none other.

811
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:30,481
<i>We must seize the moment.</i>

812
01:07:33,397 --> 01:07:35,616
This is
most definitely the future.

813
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:38,924
<i>Our shipments will be months
ahead of the competition.</i>

814
01:08:29,453 --> 01:08:31,368
I can pay the workers now.

815
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:40,377
Robert!

816
01:08:40,507 --> 01:08:41,943
How are you?

817
01:08:42,074 --> 01:08:44,120
Thank you, thank you
for taking care of the vines.

818
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:50,909
Hello. Thank you very much!

819
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:54,652
Thank you, Matthieu!

820
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:55,740
Madame.

821
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:07,969
So you're an inventor now.

822
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,496
And you would have me
return to Russia so soon.

823
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:14,889
No, I would not.

824
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,587
Now that he has abdicated
and there is peace,

825
01:09:16,717 --> 01:09:17,588
George can go.

826
01:09:17,718 --> 01:09:19,938
Oh.

827
01:09:20,068 --> 01:09:22,549
I can go and join you
in the vineyards today.

828
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,464
You're going to get
your hands dirty?

829
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:25,987
Mm-hm.

830
01:09:26,118 --> 01:09:27,467
Mud on your shoes?

831
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,210
Summons!

832
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:45,093
It's a summons for
Barbe-Nicole Clicquot.

833
01:09:47,226 --> 01:09:48,619
<i>A claim has been submitted</i>

834
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:50,534
<i>that Madame Clicquot
is running a business</i>

835
01:09:50,664 --> 01:09:53,885
<i>in violation of
the Napoleonic code of 1804</i>

836
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:56,017
and further, that her vineyard
should be placed

837
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:58,585
in the hands of
an experienced executor.

838
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:01,762
We don't have much time.

839
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:03,895
We have to read
the entirety of the Code.

840
01:10:04,025 --> 01:10:06,985
Was this the plan all along?

841
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:09,379
No, Madame.

842
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:12,512
It never occurred to them
you would succeed.

843
01:10:12,643 --> 01:10:15,211
That you would fight
so very hard for every bottle.

844
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:24,002
Get out! Get out!

845
01:10:26,787 --> 01:10:27,962
No! No!

846
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:29,312
It's too dangerous, Madame!

847
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:30,835
- Come with me!
- No!

848
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:32,402
- Come with me!
- Stop! Stop!

849
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:33,011
- It's over!
- Get off me!

850
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:34,708
Get off!

851
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:03,607
- Where were you?
- Where were you?

852
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:04,782
What are you doing?

853
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:06,000
There are things written here

854
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:08,612
that you've never
shared with me.

855
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:09,787
You're hiding.

856
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:12,224
They are things to remind me

857
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:14,182
of--of--of--
of what we have shared,

858
01:11:14,313 --> 01:11:15,358
said to each other, decided!

859
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:17,011
You were worried
about the glass.

860
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:18,317
- And I told you!
- No, you didn't.

861
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,363
- Yes!
- No, you didn't.

862
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:21,886
Calm, François. Calm, calm.

863
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:23,844
Calm? I am calm.

864
01:11:23,975 --> 01:11:25,672
This is what you do,
you trick me!

865
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:26,891
You were the one who said

866
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:29,197
we would never hide
from each other,

867
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:32,897
and now you are the one.
You hide.

868
01:11:33,027 --> 01:11:37,075
You hide in these moods,
you rave and you disappear.

869
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:38,337
Is this what you want?

870
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:40,339
How could this possibly be
what I...

871
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:56,181
Did you send Clem to the abbey

872
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,226
because you didn't want her
to see me like this?

873
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:07,888
Yeah. Yes.

874
01:12:08,019 --> 01:12:10,108
I sent her to the abbey

875
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:14,155
because I didn't want her
to be ashamed of you.

876
01:12:14,286 --> 01:12:16,854
Or afraid of you.

877
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:18,725
Or take care of you.

878
01:12:21,902 --> 01:12:24,601
And she will remain there
until you are different.

879
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:26,167
And you hid that from me?

880
01:12:29,954 --> 01:12:31,564
It was all I could do.

881
01:12:42,183 --> 01:12:44,229
Go to sleep, my love.

882
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:17,349
I love you, my darling.

883
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:21,397
I love you.

884
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:53,636
Madame,
the carriage is here.

885
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:58,510
<i>It is with great concern</i>

886
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:01,774
<i>for the well-being of not only
the Champagne district,</i>

887
01:16:01,905 --> 01:16:04,124
<i>but for
Madame Clicquot herself,</i>

888
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:06,474
<i>that we bring this claim.</i>

889
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:09,390
I regret to say it,
but her champagne falls

890
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:11,741
well short of the high
standards of our district.

891
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:14,570
If she continues to sell first,

892
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,182
our vintage
will be judged as she is.

893
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:19,662
Perhaps a situation
such as this

894
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:22,229
is precisely what
Napoleon foresaw

895
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,840
when he insisted on a law

896
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:28,061
forbidding female management
of companies.

897
01:16:28,192 --> 01:16:32,675
Monsieur Droite, who works
with Madame as estate manager,

898
01:16:32,805 --> 01:16:35,591
has been observing her
for many years.

899
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:39,769
She has been seen
knee-deep in mud,

900
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:41,727
singing to the vines.

901
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:46,079
Could you
tell me, Monsieur Droite,

902
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:50,127
why she was given
the vineyard to manage?

903
01:16:50,257 --> 01:16:54,174
Well, she was in a very fragile
and emotional state

904
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:56,089
when she pleaded
with Phillipe Clicquot

905
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,527
to run the business alone.

906
01:16:59,658 --> 01:17:04,620
He had just lost his son,
she, her husband.

907
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:08,580
There were many substantial
financial offers for the estate

908
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:10,887
but she refused them all,

909
01:17:11,017 --> 01:17:13,454
and now we are in a position where,

910
01:17:13,585 --> 01:17:18,546
due to constant borrowing,
we may have to default the bank.

911
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:24,204
I fear that she, a woman,

912
01:17:24,335 --> 01:17:26,250
is not capable of
running this vineyard.

913
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,643
And yet the reason
we are all here

914
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:29,470
is because
she is doing just that!

915
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:31,995
And you are?

916
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:35,476
I am Edouard Werler, sir.
Madame Clicquot's accountant.

917
01:17:35,607 --> 01:17:37,914
Forgive my interruption,

918
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:41,352
but this is the will
of François Clicquot

919
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:44,050
that states the land belongs
to Barbe-Nicole Clicquot

920
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:46,226
until such a time as
she wills the property

921
01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:47,619
to someone of her choosing.

922
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,099
Yes,
if she is in her right mind.

923
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:50,709
Regarding the accusation

924
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:53,103
that she is forbidden to run
a business under the law,

925
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:56,933
I would cite a major point
of the Napoleonic code of 1804,

926
01:17:57,063 --> 01:17:59,936
which states that a woman can
carry on her husband's business

927
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:02,242
after his death.

928
01:18:02,373 --> 01:18:05,115
Monsieur Moeët wants control
of her vineyard.

929
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:07,552
He doesn't care
to protect Champagne

930
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,249
or Madame Clicquot
from herself.

931
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,077
Monsieur Werler,

932
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:16,169
this court will hear testimony,
not opinion.

933
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,520
May I speak on
the subject of her...

934
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:23,176
her private life.

935
01:18:23,307 --> 01:18:24,700
Her deceit.

936
01:18:26,789 --> 01:18:27,833
You may, but keep it clean;

937
01:18:27,964 --> 01:18:30,444
there are women present.

938
01:18:30,575 --> 01:18:33,883
Madame Clicquot
is not what she seems.

939
01:18:34,013 --> 01:18:37,887
She is in an intimate,
romantic relationship

940
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:41,412
with her wine merchant.

941
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:44,458
She is a widow
only in the eyes of the law,

942
01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:46,722
to evade the law.

943
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:09,222
Shhh... Do you hear them?

944
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:11,964
Of course. Always.

945
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:15,228
I don't. Not anymore.

946
01:19:23,454 --> 01:19:26,065
I think...

947
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:30,156
all I ever wanted really
was to be happy.

948
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:31,984
Build a paradise here with you.

949
01:19:33,725 --> 01:19:37,033
Perhaps men were not
made for paradise.

950
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,082
I want to die in your arms.

951
01:19:43,213 --> 01:19:44,780
Do you still want to
die in mine?

952
01:19:47,608 --> 01:19:51,961
I do, but first,

953
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:55,138
I want to live,

954
01:19:55,268 --> 01:19:57,923
and work, and learn.

955
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:07,019
Do you remember when you said
that I was the one

956
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:08,586
who was
going to change things?

957
01:20:11,023 --> 01:20:12,459
It wasn't me.

958
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,288
Shh- shh.-Oh, my darling.

959
01:20:15,419 --> 01:20:19,510
It was never me.

960
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,251
<i>It was always you.</i>

961
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:25,385
Would you stand, please?

962
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,913
Are you remaining a widow

963
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:32,871
for the sole purpose
of running a business?

964
01:20:37,528 --> 01:20:40,444
I don't know.

965
01:20:40,574 --> 01:20:42,098
Did you say you don't know?

966
01:20:45,536 --> 01:20:46,929
I don't know.

967
01:20:53,152 --> 01:21:00,507
It's odd to listen to
how others define you

968
01:21:00,638 --> 01:21:04,947
as if you are somehow fixed,
unchanging, one person,

969
01:21:05,077 --> 01:21:09,038
instead of the many
that we all are.

970
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:12,171
I love my husband still.

971
01:21:12,302 --> 01:21:17,089
And I love Louis Bohne.
I am not just one self.

972
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,525
Your husband is dead, Madame.

973
01:21:18,656 --> 01:21:21,572
My husband is not dead.

974
01:21:21,702 --> 01:21:24,270
He lives in the vines.

975
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:25,489
Perhaps it is not best

976
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:26,882
to have you speak for yourself.

977
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,535
Why would I not be
the authority

978
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:31,451
on the subject of myself?

979
01:21:31,582 --> 01:21:34,846
I am telling the truth
as I know it,

980
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:38,458
even though I see
that telling the truth means

981
01:21:38,589 --> 01:21:43,376
I might not be
readily understood... by men,

982
01:21:43,507 --> 01:21:45,857
as it may not be what it is.

983
01:21:45,988 --> 01:21:49,600
Familiar, expected.

984
01:21:51,689 --> 01:21:55,780
But the truth is,
as I listened to you,

985
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,348
I was glad to be a woman,

986
01:21:58,478 --> 01:22:01,525
even if I lose
the rights of men.

987
01:22:04,832 --> 01:22:07,183
Men are so certain,

988
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:10,055
but does that mean
they know the truth?

989
01:22:10,186 --> 01:22:13,015
Or does it just mean
they are certain of themselves?

990
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:14,581
Yes, we-- we see your point.

991
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:18,063
And yet, we need a clear answer
to settle this claim.

992
01:22:18,194 --> 01:22:20,370
Are you remaining a widow
to evade the law?

993
01:22:22,415 --> 01:22:24,983
I am Louis Bohne, magistrate,

994
01:22:25,114 --> 01:22:29,248
the wine distributor
in question.

995
01:22:29,379 --> 01:22:31,337
Can I offer my assistance

996
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:34,036
in obtaining an answer
to your question?

997
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:35,428
You may, thank you.

998
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:53,098
Understanding that I would run
the vineyard as I see fit,

999
01:22:53,229 --> 01:22:54,926
with you by my side,

1000
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:58,886
given everything you know of me,

1001
01:23:00,366 --> 01:23:01,977
and that we've never hidden
anything from one another...

1002
01:23:07,156 --> 01:23:09,071
Barbe-Nicole,
will you marry me?

1003
01:23:15,338 --> 01:23:17,209
No.

1004
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:35,445
Widow Clicquot...
