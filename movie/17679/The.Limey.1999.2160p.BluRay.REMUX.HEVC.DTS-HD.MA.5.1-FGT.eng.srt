-Edward Roel?    -Eduardo Roel.<br />
<br />
21<br />
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,260<br />
Edward Roel?<br />
<br />
22<br />
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,730<br />
-Eduardo Roel.    -You're home, then.<br />
<br />
23<br />
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,570<br />
My name's Wilson.<br />
<br />
24<br />
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,650<br />
Wilson?<br />
<br />
25<br />
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,980<br />
You wrote me about my daughter.<br />
<br />
26<br />
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,430<br />
Oh, uh... yeah, come in.<br />
<br />
27<br />
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,540<br />
-Who done it, then?    -Huh?<br />
<br />
28<br />
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,030<br />
-Snuffed her?    -What are you talkin' about?<br />
<br />
29<br />
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,420<br />
I sent you the newspaper clipping, OK.<br />
<br />
30<br />
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,650<br />
I tell you what I know.<br />
<br />
31<br />
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,950<br />
I never said anyone was snuffed.<br />
<br />
32<br />
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,520<br />
There was an investigation, OK?<br />
<br />
33<br />
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,530<br />
The car was stolen. Jenny was...<br />
<br />
34<br />
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,450<br />
Her neck was broken, on impact.<br />
<br />
35<br />
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,240<br />
She wouldn't have felt the effects of the fire.<br />
<br />
36<br />
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,110<br />
Those streets up them hills, you gotta' be careful.<br />
<br />
37<br />
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,320<br />
Gotta keep your eyes on the ball.<br />
<br />
38<br />
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,240<br />
Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind's agitated.<br />
<br />
39<br />
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,170<br />
You're driving too fast.<br />
<br />
40<br />
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,590<br />
Those curves don't kid around.<br />
<br />
41<br />
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,660<br />
Could've happened to anybody.<br />
<br />
42<br />
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,750<br />
I didn't know her to be reckless<br />
<br />
43<br />
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,670<br />
but she'd have a drink and smoke pot and that was it.<br />
<br />
44<br />
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,340<br />
No, not my girl.<br />
<br />
45<br />
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,680<br />
Self-control, she had.<br />
<br />
46<br />
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,430<br />
It was a point of pride.<br />
<br />
47<br />
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,020<br />
Where did she get it? This grass or whatever.<br />
<br />
48<br />
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,150<br />
Oh, no. Look, I am no drug dealer. What do you think?<br />
<br />
49<br />
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,280<br />
You didn't get that ink doing National Service.<br />
<br />
50<br />
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,290<br />
I already told you. Corcoran, you know.<br />
<br />
51<br />
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,820<br />
You know what that is? State prison.<br />
<br />
52<br />
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,290<br />
I did my time. My sister's man is in Chino, doin' eight years.<br />
<br />
53<br />
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,640<br />
I go to work. I put my life together.<br />
<br />
54<br />
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,540<br />
Put all that shit behind me.<br />
<br />
55<br />
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,850<br />
Five years in the joint! That's it!<br />
<br />
56<br />
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,120<br />
I just got out myself, didn't I?<br />
<br />
57<br />
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,770<br />
This bloke she was bunked up with,<br />
<br />
58<br />
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,690<br />
-Terry Whatsit...    -Terry Valentine.<br />
<br />
59<br />
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,160<br />
What's he got to say for himself?<br />
<br />
60<br />
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,120<br />
I dunno. What he gonna say?<br />
<br />
61<br />
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,880<br />
They had a fight, she drove away. She was upset.<br />
<br />
62<br />
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,570<br />
Couple of weeks before Jenny died,<br />
<br />
63<br />
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,540<br />
she asked me to drive her downtown.<br />
<br />
64<br />
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,060<br />
She said she wanted to talk to her boyfriend, Valentine.<br />
<br />
65<br />
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,120<br />
I think she was looking for him.<br />
<br />
66<br />
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,440<br />
To catch him with another bird?<br />
<br />
67<br />
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,570<br />
Exactly, that's what I thought,<br />
<br />
68<br />
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,480<br />
but we didn't go to no hotel.<br />
<br />
69<br />
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,450<br />
-We went someplace else.    -Whereabouts?<br />
<br />
70<br />
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,420<br />
Some bad place, bad people.<br />
<br />
71<br />
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,790<br />
Some guy unloading trucks. Some kind of deal going down.<br />
<br />
72<br />
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,670<br />
I dunno and I don't care, OK?<br />
<br />
73<br />
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,630<br />
Could've been shipping fava beans to Eskimos.'<br />
<br />
74<br />
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,150<br />
Did Jenny know?<br />
<br />
75<br />
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,650<br />
Valentine wasn't there, so...<br />
<br />
76<br />
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,540<br />
if he was involved, or she was, who knows?<br />
<br />
77<br />
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,250<br />
But I wanna tell you...<br />
<br />
78<br />
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,630<br />
Jenny stood right in front of those guys,<br />
<br />
79<br />
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,240<br />
eyeballing them, checking them out.<br />
<br />
80<br />
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,430<br />
It felt like she was covering MY ass.<br />
<br />
81<br />
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,420<br />
I can't believe that.<br />
<br />
82<br />
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,150<br />
Really? What'd she say?<br />
<br />
83<br />
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,120<br />
Hang on.<br />
<br />
84<br />
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,060<br />
Can I help you?<br />
<br />
85<br />
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,270<br />
You can't be too careful nowadays.<br />
<br />
86<br />
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,560<br />
-Lot of tea leaves about.    -Excuse me?<br />
<br />
87<br />
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,830<br />
Tea leaves. Thieves. Terry Valentine. D'you know him?<br />
<br />
88<br />
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,940<br />
And... who are you?<br />
<br />
89<br />
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,910<br />
-Wilson. My name's Wilson.    -Well, Wilson, to start...<br />
<br />
90<br />
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,530<br />
-I never heard of you.    -I'm not that well known.<br />
<br />
91<br />
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,450<br />
Except in except some districts, some police nicks.<br />
<br />
92<br />
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,580<br />
-Police what?    -Me? No. Can't be bothered.<br />
<br />
93<br />
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,040<br />
Who the fuck are you? How did you get in here?<br />
<br />
94<br />
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,130<br />
Only a little bird told me<br />
<br />
95<br />
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,560<br />
that you and Terry Valentine have business dealings...<br />
<br />
96<br />
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,340<br />
I don't know anybody named Terry Valentine.<br />
<br />
97<br />
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,330<br />
-Don't you?    -Now, take a walk, pal.<br />
<br />
98<br />
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,340<br />
You're making a big mistake. Get the hell out of here.<br />
<br />
99<br />
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,190<br />
Hey!<br />
<br />
100<br />
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,230<br />
What you been up to, pal?<br />
<br />
101<br />
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,240<br />
What you been doing? You got to buck your ideas up.<br />
<br />
102<br />
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,570<br />
What you been doing?<br />
<br />
103<br />
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,910<br />
Jennifer Wilson. Jennifer Wilson...<br />
<br />
104<br />
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,250<br />
-That name mean anything?    -What's the deal here?<br />
<br />
105<br />
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,630<br />
Hold on. What the hell... Who is this guy?<br />
<br />
106<br />
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880<br />
The only reason you're not dead<br />
<br />
107<br />
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,840<br />
is I want to find out who the fuck you are.<br />
<br />
108<br />
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,470<br />
Jennifer Wilson was my daughter.<br />
<br />
109<br />
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,980<br />
-Who the fuck is...    -Wasn't she the chick<br />
<br />
110<br />
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,030<br />
that showed up down here?<br />
<br />
111<br />
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,020<br />
Yeah, talked the same as this cocksucker.<br />
<br />
112<br />
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,740<br />
Terry Valentine is a friend of mine.<br />
<br />
113<br />
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,110<br />
I don't talk about my friends with strangers.<br />
<br />
114<br />
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,910<br />
But that count daughter of yours, she come here,<br />
<br />
115<br />
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,910<br />
sticking her tits in my face. Who am I? How do I know Terry?<br />
<br />
116<br />
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,350<br />
What's the nature of our business together?<br />
<br />
117<br />
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,250<br />
I admire Terry a lot, but I gotta say,<br />
<br />
118<br />
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:51,220<br />
he let himself get royally pussy-whipped by that bitch.<br />
<br />
119<br />
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,880<br />
You know what I would like to have done to her?<br />
<br />
120<br />
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,540<br />
You know what I would like to have done?<br />
<br />
121<br />
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,380<br />
I bet she would've like that.<br />
<br />
122<br />
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,230<br />
Too bad she had to take a nosedive off that cliff.<br />
<br />
123<br />
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,190<br />
Probably dried her all up.<br />
<br />
124<br />
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,140<br />
Got him!<br />
<br />
125<br />
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,690<br />
Keep your cool.<br />
<br />
126<br />
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,850<br />
Get him out.<br />
<br />
127<br />
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,840<br />
-You want to call an ambulance?    -NO!<br />
<br />
128<br />
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,070<br />
Call Avery.<br />
<br />
129<br />
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,120<br />
Go, man! Just get outta here.<br />
<br />
130<br />
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,590<br />
Come back here, Pop, and we'll kill you.<br />
<br />
131<br />
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,920<br />
Understand? This is private property.<br />
<br />
132<br />
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,630<br />
We'll shoot you, fuck-o. Get it?<br />
<br />
133<br />
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,830<br />
Fuckin' old fart coming here. BIG, dangerous gun!<br />
<br />
134<br />
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,060<br />
We're quakin'! We're quakin'!<br />
<br />
135<br />
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,850<br />
Yeah. Shit!<br />
<br />
136<br />
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,110<br />
Hey, you come back and visit and trespass.<br />
<br />
137<br />
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,250<br />
We look forward to it, asshole. Stupid English fuck!<br />
<br />
138<br />
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,680<br />
Hey! What...<br />

You tell him! You tell him I'm coming.<br />
<br />
141<br />
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,730<br />
Tell him I'm fucking coming!<br />
<br />
142<br />
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,130<br />
Tell 'em I'm coming?<br />
<br />
143<br />
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,880<br />
"Tell HIM I'm coming."<br />

<br />
159<br />
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,340<br />
I remember telling your parents, if you're looking for a name,<br />
<br />
160<br />
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,330<br />
you can't go wrong with a constellation.<br />
<br />
161<br />
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,450<br />
I used to hate it. Now I like it.<br />
<br />
162<br />
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,230<br />
It could be worse. They could have called you...<br />
<br />
163<br />
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,170<br />
Reticulum, Pleiades.<br />
<br />
164<br />
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,580<br />
God, you're beautiful.<br />
<br />
165<br />
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,670<br />
Is there anything in this world you want or need?<br />
<br />
166<br />
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,530<br />
I want to know why you need that scary man here.<br />
<br />
167<br />
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,280<br />
Gordon? He's been with me for years.<br />
<br />
168<br />
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,080<br />
He's not as tough as he looks.<br />
<br />
169<br />
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,140<br />
-Then what good is he?    -Heard of loyalty?<br />
<br />
170<br />
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,960<br />
Yeah... I'm loyal to things that make me happy.<br />
<br />
171<br />
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,510<br />
-Oh, am I a "thing"?    -You're certainly not a person.<br />
<br />
172<br />
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,850<br />
-I'm not?    -No.<br />
<br />
173<br />
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,220<br />
You're not specific enough to be a person.<br />
<br />
174<br />
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,060<br />
You're more like a vibe.<br />
<br />
175<br />
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,540<br />
God, I'm glad we're having this little chat. Come here.<br />
<br />
176<br />
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,320<br />
Get out of the pool.<br />
<br />
177<br />
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,870<br />
Terry.<br />
<br />
178<br />
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,830<br />
I don't know what transpired exactly.<br />
<br />
179<br />
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,410<br />
-What?    -Our friends downtown.<br />
<br />
180<br />
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,040<br />
Someone took them out.<br />
<br />
181<br />
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,530<br />
Took them out? What the fuck does that mean?<br />
<br />
182<br />
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,130<br />
It used to mean, it was similar to a gangland slaying.<br />
<br />
183<br />
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,880<br />
-Maybe it still is.    -Well... well, who?<br />
<br />
184<br />
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,180<br />
-Well...    -Blacks?<br />
<br />
185<br />
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,640<br />
Blacks? No Terry, it's not their style.<br />
<br />
186<br />
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,440<br />
No, from what I gather, it was a lone gunman.<br />
<br />
187<br />
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,980<br />
You sound like the 5 o'clock news. Why tell me this shit?<br />
<br />
188<br />
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,650<br />
If you don't know,<br />
<br />
189<br />
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,320<br />
I didn't want you to hear it and then freak out.<br />
<br />
190<br />
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,630<br />
Fuck you, Jim. I don't freak out any more.<br />
<br />
191<br />
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,730<br />
Well, it's probably nothing.<br />
<br />
192<br />
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,050<br />
It's what senseless mayhem comes down to, isn't it?<br />
<br />
193<br />
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,170<br />
Bad loan, bad Judgement, bad faith.<br />
<br />
194<br />
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,670<br />
These were bad people, involved with worse people.<br />
<br />
195<br />
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,530<br />
Cops got leads.<br />
<br />
196<br />
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,830<br />
Great, as long as nobody connects anything to me.<br />
<br />
197<br />
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,760<br />
No one'll connect it to you.<br />
<br />
198<br />
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,850<br />
That was a one-off deal, like a moving freight train.<br />
<br />
199<br />
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,640<br />
Anything else, I would've had you walk away.<br />
<br />
200<br />
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,480<br />
-You never saw them again.    -Are you crazy?<br />
<br />
201<br />
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,880<br />
They're your friends, not mine.<br />
<br />
202<br />
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,640<br />
What? Your "clients"?<br />
<br />
203<br />
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,380<br />
I befriended them when you needed them.<br />
<br />
204<br />
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,360<br />
Well, the cops. I mean, you know, I'm...<br />
<br />
205<br />
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,220<br />
Are they satisfied with this... gangland shit, or what?<br />
<br />
206<br />
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,170<br />
You know the cops don't get satisfied. They get placated.<br />
<br />
207<br />
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,330<br />
They're talking to the kid who got away.<br />
<br />
208<br />
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,250<br />
The kid who called me. Well, I called them...<br />
<br />
209<br />
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,260<br />
Scared out of his wits.<br />
<br />
210<br />
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,030<br />
All he can say is that the shooter is some crazy guy.<br />
<br />
211<br />
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,740<br />
"Shooter"? Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
212<br />
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,810<br />
Yeah, he said he went nuts.<br />
<br />
213<br />
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,190<br />
He was yelling and screaming, "Tell him I'm coming."<br />
<br />
214<br />
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,780<br />
"Tell 'em I'm coming?"<br />
<br />
215<br />
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,440<br />
"Tell HIM I'm coming."<br />
<br />
216<br />
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,320<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
217<br />
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,460<br />
Nobody knows.<br />
<br />
218<br />
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,490<br />
Great. This is sure making the fuck out of my day.<br />
<br />
219<br />
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,530<br />
Terry, relax, would you, please.<br />
<br />
220<br />
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,820<br />
The goods are long gone. Money's been turned around.<br />
<br />
221<br />
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,840<br />
Middlemen are dead. This is a good thing.<br />
<br />
222<br />
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,880<br />
So, don't panic, OK?<br />
<br />
223<br />
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,430<br />
No one can link anybody to you.<br />
<br />
224<br />
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,150<br />
Jenny did.<br />
<br />
225<br />
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,270<br />
Yeah, well, Jenny could.<br />
<br />
226<br />
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,320<br />
She'd already got to you.<br />
<br />
227<br />
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,560<br />
Terry Valentine... D'you know him?<br />
<br />
228<br />
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,640<br />
Valentine came into the restaurant sometimes.<br />
<br />
229<br />
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,570<br />
The guy's a money guy.<br />
<br />
230<br />
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,710<br />
They were together how long?<br />
<br />
231<br />
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,630<br />
Five years. A long time.<br />
<br />
232<br />
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,830<br />
There you go. Jenny must've liked him.<br />
<br />
233<br />
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,590<br />
Jenny would say, "Here's my friend Eddie."<br />
<br />
234<br />
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,960<br />
He'd shake my hand but wouldn't even see me, you know?<br />
<br />
235<br />
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:58,220<br />
Jenny met him at a beach, got blinded by his smile.<br />
<br />
236<br />
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,560<br />
You believe that? Son of a bitch never smiled at me.<br />
<br />
237<br />
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,350<br />
Jenny and I were friends,<br />
<br />
238<br />
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,930<br />
but we didn't travel in the same social circles, you know?<br />
<br />
239<br />
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,830<br />
She had her life. I had mine.<br />
<br />
240<br />
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,680<br />
How'd you two hook up then?<br />
<br />
241<br />
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,130<br />
Jenny was in my acting class.<br />
<br />
242<br />
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,060<br />
She was 21 when she came to me.<br />
<br />
243<br />
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,520<br />
Straight from leaving you.<br />
<br />
244<br />
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,930<br />
You should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend.<br />
<br />
245<br />
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,650<br />
I do double duty as a voice coach.<br />
<br />
246<br />
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,120<br />
Not that her accent would've hobbled her progress.<br />
<br />
247<br />
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,550<br />
Not with that look.<br />
<br />
248<br />
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,170<br />
She didn't write me, did she?<br />
<br />
249<br />
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,770<br />
She didn't know what to say.<br />
<br />
250<br />
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,450<br />
I figured somebody should say something to someone.<br />
<br />
251<br />
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,420<br />
You're Jenny's father.<br />
<br />
252<br />
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,980<br />
Why did you come here?<br />
<br />
253<br />
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,220<br />
Thought it'd be nice to have a chat with you, that's all.<br />
<br />
254<br />
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,430<br />
No...<br />
<br />
255<br />
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,140<br />
Why did you come here?<br />
<br />
256<br />
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,870<br />
Get a few things sorted out.<br />
<br />
257<br />
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,870<br />
Been busy, have you?<br />
<br />
258<br />
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,090<br />
How do you mean?<br />
<br />
259<br />
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,960<br />
I heard you were...<br />
<br />
260<br />
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,470<br />
What is that adorable expression...<br />
<br />
261<br />
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,930<br />
at Her Majesty's pleasure.<br />
<br />
262<br />
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,220<br />
It was the bars, then.<br />
<br />
263<br />
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,860<br />
What was it, uh, Wembley Stadium job?<br />
<br />
264<br />
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,130<br />
That was it, right? Pink Floyd concert receipts.<br />
<br />
265<br />
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,940<br />
Earning interest in an offshore account.<br />
<br />
266<br />
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,280<br />
Tidy little premium per annum, that.<br />
<br />
267<br />
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,240<br />
Security like that can't be bought.<br />
<br />
268<br />
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,780<br />
Must be more comforting than having a daughter to greet you.<br />
<br />
269<br />
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,730<br />
Oi, ain't you gonna let me in?<br />
<br />
270<br />
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,130<br />
You can call me again.<br />
<br />
271<br />
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,790<br />
Weren't you in a soap on the box?<br />
<br />
272<br />
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,130<br />
Three Seasons. Who told you that? Eddie?<br />
<br />
273<br />
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,930<br />
Yeah, Eddie. Yeah. He's my new china.<br />
<br />
274<br />
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,640<br />
-Ch... What?    -China plate, mate. Me and him.<br />
<br />
275<br />
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,850<br />
Quite a character, isn't he?<br />
<br />
276<br />
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,560<br />
Not to you. To us squares in the outside world.<br />
<br />
277<br />
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,920<br />
He give me your address.<br />
<br />
278<br />
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,820<br />
I gave him yours. I guess I was being loyal to Jenny,<br />
<br />
279<br />
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,950<br />
who told me she didn't have a father.<br />
<br />
280<br />
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,140<br />
Before, of course, proceeding to tell me why.<br />
<br />
281<br />
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,430<br />
Yeah... Well...<br />
<br />
282<br />
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,420<br />
She was right in a way.<br />
<br />
283<br />
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,590<br />
Her mum died when she was six.<br />
<br />
284<br />
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,610<br />
After that she was on her own.<br />
<br />
285<br />
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,260<br />
Aunts and uncles and then...<br />
<br />
286<br />
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,460<br />
How can you keep her down on the farm after she's seen L.A.?<br />
<br />
287<br />
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,980<br />
I got compassionate leave from Parkhurst<br />
<br />
288<br />
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,670<br />
to see her in hospital.<br />
<br />
289<br />
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,310<br />
Cos we was always mates,<br />
<br />
290<br />
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,060<br />
Jenny's mum and me.<br />
<br />
291<br />
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,720<br />
I like to think they're together now, you know?<br />
<br />
292<br />
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,640<br />
Heavenly choir.<br />
<br />
293<br />
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,380<br />
That's where you got the word?<br />
<br />
294<br />
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,830<br />
That's where Eddie wrote you, in prison?<br />
<br />
295<br />
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,350<br />
Oh, no, no. I knew. I knew before Ed.<br />
<br />
296<br />
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,980<br />
Uh...<br />
<br />
297<br />
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,550<br />
What time was it supposed to have happened?<br />
<br />
298<br />
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,870<br />
Eddie said... two in the morning.<br />
<br />
299<br />
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,280<br />
That's eight hours difference between here and London,<br />
<br />
300<br />
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,520<br />
that would have made it about like... ten o'clock my time.<br />
<br />
301<br />
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,990<br />
I was going out in the yard.<br />
<br />
302<br />
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,290<br />
I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.<br />
<br />
303<br />
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,790<br />
Stretch me legs,<br />
<br />
304<br />
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,710<br />
breath of fresh air, bit of a read,<br />
<br />
305<br />
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,380<br />
stretch out the good part of the day.<br />
<br />
306<br />
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,750<br />
And I couldn't open the newspaper.<br />
<br />
307<br />
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,050<br />
It was like the pages was glued together.<br />
<br />
308<br />
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,720<br />
Me hands were that weak.<br />
<br />
309<br />
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,680<br />
I thought I was havin' a heart attack.<br />
<br />
310<br />
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,430<br />
Course I know I wasn't.<br />
<br />
311<br />
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,180<br />
Guy I knew come up.<br />
<br />
312<br />
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,980<br />
"Here, Wilson", he said, "You're as white as a sheet."<br />
<br />
313<br />
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,230<br />
I said, "Fuck me, I've been in prison half me life."<br />
<br />
314<br />
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,460<br />
But he was dead-on. I'd felt all the blood drain out of me head.<br />
<br />
315<br />
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,320<br />
And I knew...<br />
<br />
316<br />
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,450<br />
Huh, I knew something must've happened to Jen.<br />
<br />
317<br />
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,870<br />
She was... magic.<br />
<br />
318<br />
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,530<br />
I can't believe Jenny told you all that about me.<br />
<br />
319<br />
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,720<br />
She was always so embarrassed.<br />
<br />
320<br />
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,590<br />
Not embarrassed.<br />
<br />
321<br />
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,720<br />
Ashamed?<br />
<br />
322<br />
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,630<br />
Not ashamed.<br />
<br />
323<br />
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,870<br />
Disappointed.<br />
<br />
324<br />
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,240<br />
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?<br />
<br />
325<br />
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,750<br />
Some pop music producer, isn't he?<br />
<br />
326<br />
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,150<br />
Rock and roll we call it.<br />
<br />
327<br />
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,420<br />
Kind of a promoter, I guess.<br />
<br />
328<br />
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,040<br />
Whatever that means.<br />
<br />
329<br />
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,730<br />
He took the whole<br />
<br />
330<br />
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,660<br />
'60s Southern California zeitgeist and ran with it.<br />
<br />
331<br />
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,550<br />
Packaged and sold it.<br />
<br />
332<br />
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,630<br />
Made out like a bandit.<br />
<br />
333<br />
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,990<br />
What's the deal, hm?<br />
<br />
334<br />
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,020<br />
You and Terry Valentine at 20 paces? Come on.<br />
<br />
335<br />
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,540<br />
Is that it?<br />
<br />
336<br />
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,870<br />
-I don't see why not.    -Are you serious?<br />
<br />
337<br />
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,240<br />
Have you ever known me not to be?<br />
<br />
338<br />
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,720<br />
You fucking guys and your dicks, man.<br />
<br />
339<br />
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,260<br />
What do you expect me to do?<br />
<br />
340<br />
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,370<br />
Stay at home doing sweet F.A.?<br />
<br />
341<br />
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,120<br />
You don't believe it was a car accident?<br />
<br />
342<br />
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,710<br />
Oh, yeah!<br />
<br />
343<br />
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,130<br />
She fell asleep at the wheel!<br />
<br />
344<br />
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,250<br />
Terry is never gonna give you that satisfaction.<br />
<br />
345<br />
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,640<br />
He is NOT the type.<br />
<br />
346<br />
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,340<br />
-Depends, dunnit?    -On what?<br />
<br />
347<br />
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,230<br />
What makes you so certain?<br />
<br />
348<br />
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,460<br />
I bloody ask 'im.<br />
<br />
349<br />
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,140<br />
Fine, there's the phone.<br />
<br />
350<br />
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,360<br />
Want his number?<br />
<br />
351<br />
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,540<br />
I've got his number!<br />
<br />
352<br />
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,370<br />
Whatever you gotta do, man. Better go do it.<br />
<br />
353<br />
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,440<br />
Looks like he's brought in the 'eavy mob.<br />
<br />
354<br />
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,350<br />
-You're kidding me?    -Extra muscle. Bodyguards.<br />
<br />
355<br />
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,250<br />
They look a right load of wallies.<br />
<br />
356<br />
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,250<br />
You should see 'em. Patrolling up and down there.<br />
<br />
357<br />
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,460<br />
Let me see.<br />
<br />
358<br />
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,360<br />
Done up like fucking household cavalry.<br />
<br />
359<br />
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,250<br />
Those are valets, man.<br />
<br />
360<br />
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,780<br />
Valets? What do you mean, valets? Who does he think he is?<br />
<br />
361<br />
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,240<br />
The Marquess of fuckin' Tavistock?<br />
<br />
362<br />
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,360<br />
Valets, man. They park cars. They're having a party.<br />
<br />
363<br />
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,280<br />
Are they?<br />
<br />
364<br />
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,940<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
365<br />
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,340<br />
Oi! Trousers, keep it 'andy. We're not gonna be staying long.<br />
<br />
366<br />
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,570<br />
-Yes, sir.    -Vengo ahora.<br />
<br />
367<br />
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,020<br />
Boy, we're a little early, huh?<br />
<br />
368<br />
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,780<br />
Well, first in, first out. That's me.<br />
<br />
369<br />
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,560<br />
Good evening.<br />
<br />
370<br />
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,220<br />
Mind how you go.<br />
<br />
371<br />
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,080<br />
Gentlemen, what can I get you?<br />
<br />
372<br />
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,930<br />
Babycham. Eduardo...<br />
<br />
373<br />
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,340<br />
Do you want it with a twist?<br />
<br />
374<br />
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,130<br />
Tomato juice with Tabasco.<br />
<br />
375<br />
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,780<br />
I'll have a coke.<br />
<br />
376<br />
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,960<br />
You have the same posters.<br />
<br />
377<br />
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,880<br />
-What?    -That you have at your office.<br />
<br />
378<br />
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,730<br />
No, they're different.<br />
<br />
379<br />
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,280<br />
-Well, I like the colours.    -We all did.<br />
<br />
380<br />
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,370<br />
Hmm, must have been a time, huh?<br />
<br />
381<br />
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,760<br />
In golden moment.<br />
<br />
382<br />
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,540<br />
Have you ever dreamed about a place...<br />
<br />
383<br />
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,570<br />
you never really recalled being to before?<br />
<br />
384<br />
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,130<br />
A place that maybe only exists in your imagination?<br />
<br />
385<br />
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,560<br />
Some place far away,<br />
<br />
386<br />
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,660<br />
half-remembered when you wake up.<br />
<br />
387<br />
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,440<br />
When you were there, though, you knew the language.<br />
<br />
388<br />
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,860<br />
You knew your way around.<br />
<br />
389<br />
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,960<br />
That was the '60s.<br />
<br />
390<br />
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,070<br />
No, it wasn't that, either.<br />
<br />
391<br />
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,370<br />
It was just '66 and early '67.<br />
<br />
392<br />
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,340<br />
That's all it was.<br />
<br />
393<br />
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,550<br />
I'm gonna have a butcher's round the house.<br />
<br />
394<br />
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,830<br />
Who you gonna butcher?<br />
<br />
395<br />
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,860<br />
Butcher's hook, 'look'.<br />
<br />
396<br />
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,630<br />
Butcher's... look. Hm.<br />
<br />
397<br />
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,730<br />
Mm, try one of these.<br />
<br />
398<br />
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,450<br />
No, I don't like that. Try one of these.<br />
<br />
399<br />
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,820<br />
Hi.<br />
<br />
400<br />
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,250<br />
-Terry. How you doing?    -Great, how you doing?<br />
<br />
401<br />
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,540<br />
-Very well, thank you.    -Good to see you.<br />
<br />
402<br />
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,910<br />
Our counterfeit CDs are doing well...<br />
<br />
403<br />
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,330<br />
Do I know you?<br />
<br />
404<br />
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,750<br />
It was meant to be an infinity pool and go off the edge.<br />
<br />
405<br />
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,750<br />
-Definitely business affairs.    -Terry Valentine.<br />
<br />
406<br />
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,130<br />
-Good to see you.    -Nice to meet you.<br />
<br />
407<br />
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,250<br />
Shit.<br />
<br />
408<br />
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,580<br />
Hello? Hey.<br />
<br />
409<br />
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,320<br />
No, it's Crestview Terrace, not Crestview Place.<br />
<br />
410<br />
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,250<br />
Yeah. No, there's three different ways up the hill.<br />
<br />
411<br />
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,850<br />
The best way is to take Loma Vista.<br />
<br />
412<br />
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,630<br />
Loma Lin... Loma Linda.<br />
<br />
413<br />
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,930<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
414<br />
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,960<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
415<br />
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,720<br />
OK. All right, bye.<br />
<br />
416<br />
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,380<br />
Hi, how you doing? Good to see you.<br />
<br />
417<br />
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,240<br />
-Well, you know...    -Unbelievable.<br />
<br />
418<br />
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,360<br />
It's the record business. What can you say?<br />
<br />
419<br />
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,430<br />
-It's the 'how-are-you' crowd.    -The 'how-are-you' crowd...<br />
<br />
420<br />
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,850<br />
There you are.<br />
<br />
421<br />
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,140<br />
-Well, you know Jim.    -Of course. We know.<br />
<br />
422<br />
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,560<br />
Blimey!<br />
<br />
423<br />
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,570<br />
If you can afford a house like this you buy one.<br />
<br />
424<br />
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,360<br />
What are we standing on?<br />
<br />
425<br />
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,640<br />
Trust.<br />
<br />
426<br />
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,730<br />
You know, you could see the sea out there<br />
<br />
427<br />
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,740<br />
if you could see it.<br />
<br />
428<br />
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,120<br />
Could yer?<br />
<br />
429<br />
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,740<br />
Mm. Where are you going?<br />
<br />
430<br />
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,140<br />
Hello?<br />
<br />
431<br />
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,130<br />
The pool's hot, too, if you want to.<br />
<br />
432<br />
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,330<br />
Well, you know...<br />
<br />
433<br />
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,450<br />
No, we're not doing this.<br />
<br />
434<br />
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,360<br />
You produced the first Christopher Cross album?<br />
<br />
435<br />
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,740<br />
Come on, come on.<br />
<br />
436<br />
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,860<br />
What was he like, huh?<br />
<br />
437<br />
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:07,140<br />
-Just give me a bit, a nugget.    -I just do the contracts.<br />
<br />
438<br />
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,450<br />
-That's it?    -Yeah, just the contracts.<br />
<br />
439<br />
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,670<br />
Bring the motor round. Bang out front.<br />
<br />
440<br />
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,360<br />
Oi!<br />
<br />
441<br />
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,750<br />
Point it downhill.<br />
<br />
442<br />
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,630<br />
As I was driving down Melrose, taking a left on Seward,<br />
<br />
443<br />
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,360<br />
I saw this guy locking a car, so unmarked it was marked.<br />
<br />
444<br />
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,760<br />
I mean it was just, w...<br />
<br />
445<br />
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,130<br />
-There's a guy down there.    -Call the police.<br />
<br />
446<br />
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,770<br />
No, no.<br />
<br />
447<br />
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,330<br />
Dame la llave, gracias, gracias.<br />
<br />
448<br />
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,780<br />
Excuse me. Can I help you?<br />
<br />
449<br />
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,580<br />
Ahh!<br />
<br />
450<br />
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,780<br />
Go, go.<br />
<br />
451<br />
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,450<br />
Are you OK?<br />
<br />
452<br />
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,750<br />
Steady on, Fangio.<br />
<br />
453<br />
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,920<br />
Man, you steady on! What the fuck you do?<br />
<br />
454<br />
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,530<br />
You didn't cap the guy, did you?<br />
<br />
455<br />
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,050<br />
Did you?<br />
<br />
456<br />
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,420<br />
That would have been too easy.<br />
<br />
457<br />
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,670<br />
-Too easy?    -He's gotta know why.<br />
<br />
458<br />
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,460<br />
You think a guy like that ever will?<br />
<br />
459<br />
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,350<br />
-Down!    -Whoa!<br />
<br />
460<br />
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,540<br />
Whoa!<br />
<br />
461<br />
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,470<br />
Fuck!<br />
<br />
462<br />
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:05,070<br />
Wilson, Wilson! Wilson!<br />
<br />
463<br />
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,070<br />
Come on, man!<br />
<br />
464<br />
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,080<br />
Come on, come on, come on.<br />
<br />
465<br />
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,830<br />
Shit!<br />
<br />
466<br />
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,430<br />
Wilson.<br />
<br />
467<br />
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,530<br />
Oh, boy.<br />
<br />
468<br />
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,930<br />
Should have let ME do the talking.<br />
<br />
469<br />
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,330<br />
Cos you're my security consultant?<br />
<br />
470<br />
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,760<br />
What's going on?<br />
<br />
471<br />
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,060<br />
-What did you say?    -I said an employee flipped.<br />
<br />
472<br />
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,770<br />
That he had drug problems, and he refused counselling...<br />
<br />
473<br />
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,440<br />
which is true... And he committed suicide.<br />
<br />
474<br />
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,360<br />
One of the guests tried to stop him.<br />
<br />
475<br />
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,570<br />
Jim, how the fuck do you stop Gordon at 400 pounds?<br />
<br />
476<br />
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,740<br />
That was good, that was good.<br />
<br />
477<br />
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,910<br />
-He's heavier now, isn't he?    -Oh!<br />
<br />
478<br />
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,750<br />
Jenny never told you about her dad.<br />
<br />
479<br />
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,710<br />
Oh, what dad, what dad?<br />
<br />
480<br />
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,240<br />
He was in prison nine years and was released last month.<br />
<br />
481<br />
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,240<br />
Jenny's father was in prison?<br />
<br />
482<br />
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,680<br />
For what?<br />
<br />
483<br />
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,510<br />
-Armed robbery. Again.    -Again? Oh, my God.<br />
<br />
484<br />
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,680<br />
Yeah, he a career criminal. On leave of absence. Get it?<br />
<br />
485<br />
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,520<br />
Where are you going?<br />
<br />
486<br />
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,610<br />
Don't you think I outta find him before they do?<br />
<br />
487<br />
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,030<br />
Oh, man. I am screwed.<br />
<br />
488<br />
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,110<br />
I'm screwed to the wall!<br />
<br />
489<br />
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,740<br />
He never entered the country under his own name.<br />
<br />
490<br />
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,450<br />
Give me a fucking break, man, can you?<br />
<br />
491<br />
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,960<br />
Well, I would if I came this far to kill someone.<br />
<br />
492<br />
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,420<br />
Oh, man.<br />
<br />
493<br />
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:24,550<br />
OK, not even one of your guys should handle this.<br />
<br />
494<br />
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,010<br />
Do you want me to tell them?<br />
<br />
495<br />
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,090<br />
No, I mean...<br />
<br />
496<br />
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,140<br />
I told them I didn't know who the guy was.<br />
<br />
497<br />
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,520<br />
People come, people go. How are you gonna find him?<br />
<br />
498<br />
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,730<br />
Terry, he's not James Bond, you know?<br />
<br />
499<br />
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,070<br />
-This is a pathetic sad sack...    -Tell that to Gordon.<br />
<br />
500<br />
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,050<br />
What's England? Some country half the size of Wyoming<br />
<br />
501<br />
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,030<br />
where the cops don't even carry guns?<br />
<br />
502<br />
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,740<br />
This is getting too close to me.<br />
<br />
503<br />
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,920<br />
You know something? People close to you fall into canyons.<br />
<br />
504<br />
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,530<br />
Oh, well now, that's brilliant.<br />
<br />
505<br />
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,670<br />
Hey, relax.<br />
<br />
506<br />
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,940<br />
I have other resources. I have other resources.<br />
<br />
507<br />
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,130<br />
No-one even near to me<br />
<br />
508<br />
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,970<br />
because I am out of here.<br />
<br />
509<br />
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,940<br />
I'm gone.<br />
<br />
510<br />
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,930<br />
How are you so lucky, Terry?<br />
<br />
511<br />
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,750<br />
I learned how to skate as a little boy.<br />
<br />
512<br />
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:29,730<br />
Well, you know...<br />
<br />
513<br />
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,950<br />
Half a dozen interventions if a person won't face up to it.<br />
<br />
514<br />
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,320<br />
I guess not.<br />
<br />
515<br />
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:40,290<br />
People in this industry are taken down by doing too many...<br />
<br />
516<br />
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,430<br />
...many...<br />
<br />
517<br />
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,860<br />
...drugs.<br />
<br />
518<br />
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,480<br />
Straight rotation, no bullshit, call your shots.<br />
<br />
519<br />
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,860<br />
-Scratch the eight, you lose.    -That's good.<br />
<br />
520<br />
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,110<br />
-Let me break, right?    -Yeah, break 'em up.<br />
<br />
521<br />
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,870<br />
-He broke last time.    -What did you say?<br />
<br />
522<br />
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,240<br />
I said he broke last time.<br />
<br />
523<br />
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,620<br />
So what. Look at him. He loves to break.<br />
<br />
524<br />
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,790<br />
Look, he's all excited.<br />
<br />
525<br />
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,930<br />
I don't give a shit if he likes to break, it's my break.<br />
<br />
526<br />
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,030<br />
I won the break.<br />
<br />
527<br />
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,890<br />
-I won the break!    -What's the fuck is that?<br />
<br />
528<br />
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,420<br />
-Are these your quarters there?    -Yeah.<br />
<br />
529<br />
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,630<br />
-What's he doin'?    -I dunno.<br />
<br />
530<br />
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,870<br />
Go and fuck yourself, and take Mr. Goodwrench with you.<br />
<br />
531<br />
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,170<br />
Blow it out your arse, but my dick's in the way.<br />
<br />
532<br />
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,480<br />
Did I cross the line?<br />
<br />
533<br />
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,940<br />
Does that mean you forfeit?<br />
<br />
534<br />
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,240<br />
-Just wanted to play a game.    -Stacy!<br />
<br />
535<br />
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,630<br />
Come over here.<br />
<br />
536<br />
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,110<br />
How's it going, kid?<br />
<br />
537<br />
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,660<br />
Not bad.<br />
<br />
538<br />
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,450<br />
-Could you kill someone for me?    -OK.<br />
<br />
539<br />
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,080<br />
Same as last time. The rest after.<br />
<br />
540<br />
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,170<br />
Where do we go?<br />
<br />
541<br />
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,920<br />
When you find the guy you'll know.<br />
<br />
542<br />
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,150<br />
I just do it. I don't organise it.<br />
<br />
543<br />
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:50,390<br />
I'll point you there, but you take it to the end zone.<br />
<br />
544<br />
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,720<br />
A hit-and-run gunman.<br />
<br />
545<br />
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,340<br />
I figure he's not cruisin' the polo lounge.<br />
<br />
546<br />
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,080<br />
This is unprofessional, man.<br />
<br />
547<br />
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,370<br />
Well, you see a successful man like me has limitations.<br />
<br />
548<br />
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:07,820<br />
I lose touch with the street. I depend on smart boys like you.<br />
<br />
549<br />
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,210<br />
You're closer to the nitty gritty...<br />
<br />
550<br />
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,630<br />
Fuck you, mister, all right?<br />
<br />
551<br />
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,820<br />
This is a lifestyle I embrace.<br />
<br />
552<br />
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,290<br />
So you take care of this.<br />
<br />
553<br />
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,840<br />
You see, I'm the one with appearances to maintain.<br />
<br />
554<br />
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,380<br />
But who gives a shit about you?<br />
<br />
555<br />
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,630<br />
Not even God.<br />
<br />
556<br />
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,840<br />
Get it done.<br />
<br />
557<br />
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,530<br />
Get a tie.<br />
<br />
558<br />
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,150<br />
-How much?    -Five grand.<br />
<br />
559<br />
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,780<br />
-Hey!    -Got half in my pocket.<br />
<br />
560<br />
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,990<br />
-Making trouble for someone?    -Yup.<br />
<br />
561<br />
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,120<br />
-Which kind?    -The forever kind.<br />
<br />
562<br />
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,830<br />
Maybe she doesn't know the English dude.<br />
<br />
563<br />
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,020<br />
Avery said she knew the guy's daughter.<br />
<br />
564<br />
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,150<br />
That don't mean nothin'.<br />
<br />
565<br />
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,150<br />
-She's nice lookin'.    -So what?<br />
<br />
566<br />
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,610<br />
I just said she's nice lookin'.<br />
<br />
567<br />
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,180<br />
I said, "So what?" Think she's any happier?<br />
<br />
568<br />
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,780<br />
-What do you mean?    -Happier than other assholes.<br />
<br />
569<br />
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,580<br />
I dunno, I never met her.<br />
<br />
570<br />
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:45,040<br />
Why don't they make shows about people's daily lives<br />
<br />
571<br />
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,050<br />
you'd be interested in watching,<br />
<br />
572<br />
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,890<br />
like sick old man or skinny little weakling, or big fat guy?<br />
<br />
573<br />
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,850<br />
I'd watch a show called 'Big Fat Guy'.<br />
<br />
574<br />
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,450<br />
Extras, excuse me, 'background artists'.<br />
<br />
575<br />
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:02,730<br />
"Hey, Mom and Dad. How's it goin'? Yeah, Hollywood's great."<br />
<br />
576<br />
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,460<br />
"Yes, still a loser."<br />
<br />
577<br />
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,260<br />
I wonder what it's like to have tits.<br />
<br />
578<br />
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,740<br />
Are you gay enough, or what? "Hello, Studio City." Fag.<br />
<br />
579<br />
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,780<br />
Look at this guy. Yeah, they need that right away.<br />
<br />
580<br />
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,150<br />
What's the smartest thing to come out of a woman's mouth?<br />
<br />
581<br />
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,240<br />
Einstein's cock.<br />
<br />
582<br />
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,590<br />
That kid's cute, though.<br />
<br />
583<br />
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,880<br />
Know what I mean? She's a little young, but...<br />
<br />
584<br />
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,670<br />
You wanna run with me now?<br />
<br />
585<br />
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,140<br />
Did you forget your words?<br />
<br />
586<br />
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,940<br />
Step aside, ma'am.<br />
<br />
587<br />
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,140<br />
Come with us.<br />
<br />
588<br />
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,310<br />
Wasn't half crowded in that car, wasn't it?<br />
<br />
589<br />
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,190<br />
Drug enforcement?<br />
<br />
590<br />
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,540<br />
Huh! Narcs?<br />
<br />
591<br />
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,240<br />
God!<br />
<br />
592<br />
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,990<br />
I don't suppose you'd prefer a steady income?<br />
<br />
593<br />
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,120<br />
I've got a steady income.<br />
<br />
594<br />
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,780<br />
I'm on the dole.<br />
<br />
595<br />
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,670<br />
A leech on the welfare state in addition.<br />
<br />
596<br />
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,420<br />
You don't miss a trick.<br />
<br />
597<br />
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,040<br />
Just a fiddle.<br />
<br />
598<br />
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,840<br />
They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.<br />
<br />
599<br />
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:15,640<br />
Huh, yeah. Jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary siblings.<br />
<br />
600<br />
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:20,140<br />
Do you even remember the last time you saw her?<br />
<br />
601<br />
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,560<br />
I remember every time I saw her.<br />
<br />
602<br />
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,570<br />
I watched her grow up.<br />
<br />
603<br />
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,840<br />
In increments.<br />
<br />
604<br />
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,560<br />
She told me you were a ghost in her life.<br />
<br />
605<br />
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,450<br />
Daddy, the friendly ghost.<br />
<br />
606<br />
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,250<br />
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine<br />
<br />
607<br />
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,670<br />
I wasn't in the Royal Marines<br />
<br />
608<br />
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,890<br />
or playing lago in a world tour of Othello.<br />

She was always threatening me.<br />
<br />
616<br />
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,550<br />
Can you imagine?<br />
<br />
617<br />
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,260<br />
"If you're naughty, Dad,<br />
<br />
618<br />
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:34,140<br />
I'll put the law on yer, promise."<br />
<br />
619<br />
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,930<br />
She didn't want me inside again, see?<br />
<br />
620<br />
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:42,330<br />
And if she got wind that I was planning something,<br />
<br />
621<br />
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,330<br />
"I'll shop yer, Dad. I promise, I'll shop yer."<br />
<br />
622<br />
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,190<br />
I can see her on the phone.<br />
<br />
623<br />
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,530<br />
"Look, Dad. I'm calling the Old Bill right now."<br />
<br />
624<br />
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,660<br />
It became a sort of joke between us,<br />
<br />
625<br />
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,440<br />
only it wasn't really.<br />
<br />
626<br />
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,940<br />
She never would've turned you in.<br />
<br />
627<br />
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,260<br />
Not in a million years.<br />
<br />
628<br />
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,150<br />
Oh, I know that.<br />
<br />
629<br />
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,840<br />
But as time went on,<br />
<br />
630<br />
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:20,860<br />
when, in ever decreasing circles, the joke wore off.<br />
<br />
631<br />
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:26,950<br />
She had a feeling 'bout this last job.<br />
<br />
632<br />
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,260<br />
How long I'd get banged up for.<br />
<br />
633<br />
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,280<br />
Said she wouldn't be around this time<br />
<br />
634<br />
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,870<br />
when I got out.<br />
<br />
635<br />
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,260<br />
And she wasn't.<br />
<br />
636<br />
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,450<br />
How you doin' then? All right, are yer?<br />
<br />
637<br />
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,620<br />
Look, squire. You're the guv'nor 'ere, I can see that.<br />
<br />
638<br />
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:21,160<br />
Don't get your knickers in a twist.<br />
<br />
639<br />
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:22,660<br />
Whatever this is,<br />
<br />
640<br />
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,640<br />
going down between you and Valentine,<br />
<br />
641<br />
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,790<br />
it's nothin' to do with me.<br />
<br />
642<br />
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,420<br />
Couldn't care less, OK, mate?<br />
<br />
643<br />
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,830<br />
Let me explain. When I was in prison, second time, er...<br />
<br />
644<br />
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:36,220<br />
Er, no, tell a lie, third stretch. Yep, third.<br />
<br />
645<br />
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:40,350<br />
There was this screw what really had it in for me.<br />
<br />
646<br />
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:43,060<br />
That geezer was top of my list.<br />
<br />
647<br />
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:46,020<br />
Years later I sees 'im in Holland Park.<br />
<br />
648<br />
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:48,320<br />
Sitting on a bench feeding bloody pigeons.<br />
<br />
649<br />
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,730<br />
I could have gone up behind him<br />
<br />
650<br />
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:54,320<br />
and snapped his fucking neck. Wallop. But I left it.<br />
<br />
651<br />
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,410<br />
I could have, but I didn't.<br />
<br />
652<br />
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,910<br />
What I thought I wanted, I didn't.<br />
<br />
653<br />
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,790<br />
I was thinkin' about something else.<br />
<br />
654<br />
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,240<br />
I didn't give a toss, see?<br />
<br />
655<br />
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,290<br />
This berk on the bench wasn't worth my time.<br />
<br />
656<br />
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,550<br />
It meant sod all in the end.<br />
<br />
657<br />
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:12,510<br />
Choose when to do it and when not to.<br />
<br />
658<br />
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,180<br />
When it matters, and when it don't.<br />
<br />
659<br />
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:18,510<br />
Bide yer time. That's what prison teaches if nothing else.<br />
<br />
660<br />
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,560<br />
Bide yer time and everything becomes clear.<br />
<br />
661<br />
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,840<br />
And you can act accordingly.<br />
<br />
662<br />
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,480<br />
There's one thing I don't understand.<br />
<br />
663<br />
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:37,530<br />
The thing I don't understand is every fuckin' word you've said.<br />
<br />
664<br />
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,130<br />
Do you know what I reckon?<br />
<br />
665<br />
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,540<br />
You and I are after the same thing but for different reasons.<br />
<br />
666<br />
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,010<br />
-And what would that be?    -The reasons?<br />
<br />
667<br />
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,870<br />
Start with the thing.<br />
<br />
668<br />
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:03,790<br />
I imagine whatever you're after involves a large sum of money.<br />
<br />
669<br />
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:08,370<br />
And that's not what lights your fire?<br />
<br />
670<br />
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:14,350<br />
In the past, granted. I have redistributed wealth.<br />
<br />
671<br />
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,370<br />
But no, I'm after another kind<br />
<br />
672<br />
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,660<br />
of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
673<br />
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,860<br />
Do you know what I mean?<br />
<br />
674<br />
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:26,250<br />
You're not from around here, are you?<br />
<br />
675<br />
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,670<br />
You're not carrying any kind of ID.<br />
<br />
676<br />
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,940<br />
Who me? ID? No. When your chaps went through my pockets,<br />
<br />
677<br />
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,470<br />
there was nothing there.<br />
<br />
678<br />
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,350<br />
What's your connection to Terry Valentine?<br />
<br />
679<br />
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:44,830<br />
My daughter was living with 'im when she died.<br />
<br />
680<br />
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:50,860<br />
I imagine about the same time as whatever the deal was,<br />
<br />
681<br />
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,530<br />
that Terry Valentine grafted you out of your share of.<br />
<br />
682<br />
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,740<br />
-When I say grafted...    -You think...<br />
<br />
683<br />
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,830<br />
Terry Valentine screwed me out of some deal?<br />
<br />
684<br />
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:04,520<br />
It wouldn't surprise me. He's as straight as a dog's hind leg.<br />
<br />
685<br />
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,670<br />
What could this deal have been,<br />
<br />
686<br />
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:14,280<br />
to have set in motion such an unfortunate chain of events.<br />
<br />
687<br />
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,750<br />
Could've been anything.<br />
<br />
688<br />
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:21,520<br />
Shit load of heroin imported from somewhere or other.<br />
<br />
689<br />
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,020<br />
The usual scumbags involved.<br />
<br />
690<br />
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,130<br />
But the thing about scumbags is...<br />
<br />
691<br />
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:30,070<br />
no matter what they do with the drugs, the harder thing to move<br />
<br />
692<br />
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,940<br />
is the money.<br />
<br />
693<br />
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:35,650<br />
In my line of work the best thing to do is follow the money,<br />
<br />
694<br />
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,530<br />
cos you can't hide the money.<br />
<br />
695<br />
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,240<br />
You can only disguise it. So you do what?<br />
<br />
696<br />
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,620<br />
You find some rich fool to bank all the cash.<br />
<br />
697<br />
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,540<br />
Make it look legitimate<br />
<br />
698<br />
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,590<br />
in exchange for skimming a percentage off the top.<br />
<br />
699<br />
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,830<br />
Maybe as much as a million dollars commission.<br />
<br />
700<br />
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:54,970<br />
Rich fool, who overextended himself over time,<br />
<br />
701<br />
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,340<br />
in danger of not being so rich any more.<br />
<br />
702<br />
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,450<br />
But I can't be sure. Can't prove anything.<br />
<br />
703<br />
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,230<br />
Anything at all.<br />
<br />
704<br />
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,460<br />
What was your daughter's involvement?<br />
<br />
705<br />
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,860<br />
That's what I want to know.<br />
<br />
706<br />
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,490<br />
I was hoping you might...<br />
<br />
707<br />
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,280<br />
The security guard that works for Valentine?<br />
<br />
708<br />
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,730<br />
He's the one who sent those creeps after you.<br />
<br />
709<br />
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,740<br />
I shouldn't wonder. Yeah, must've done.<br />
<br />
710<br />
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,450<br />
He's quite a slippery fellow.<br />
<br />
711<br />
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:27,730<br />
But he keeps his hands clean and Valentine's.<br />
<br />
712<br />
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,830<br />
Darn it, there go my... slippery hands again.<br />
<br />
713<br />
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,040<br />
There was an incident downtown a couple of days ago<br />
<br />
714<br />
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:57,440<br />
that may have spurred this... most recent activity.<br />
<br />
715<br />
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,130<br />
You don't know about that, right?<br />
<br />
716<br />
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,860<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
717<br />
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:12,140<br />
Your daughter, she had a fondness for dangerous men?<br />
<br />
718<br />
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,140<br />
Shame about the money, though.<br />
<br />
719<br />
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:21,560<br />
Going into Valentine's pocket and not yours.<br />
<br />
720<br />
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,060<br />
I don't give a shit about the money.<br />
<br />
721<br />
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:29,930<br />
Personally, I prefer the heroin.<br />
<br />
722<br />
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,610<br />
See, crooks move faster than the system,<br />
<br />
723<br />
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,780<br />
so if we're gonna clean up the neighbourhood,<br />
<br />
724<br />
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:44,430<br />
we don't have time for things like search warrants and trials.<br />
<br />
725<br />
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,290<br />
Procedure becomes whatever you gotta do... on the day.<br />
<br />
726<br />
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:55,550<br />
Uh-huh.<br />
<br />
727<br />
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,450<br />
Er, cheers mate.<br />
<br />
728<br />
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:07,230<br />

I was coming back from a motorcycle classic in Sturgis,<br />
<br />
736<br />
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:52,360<br />
South Dakota, on US Highway 14 just that side of Spotted Horse.<br />
<br />
737<br />
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:55,150<br />
I ran into a deer, I had no chance.<br />
<br />
738<br />
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,950<br />
Though the highway patrol had mowed the sides,<br />
<br />
739<br />
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,280<br />
where the culverts were they couldn't mow<br />
<br />
740<br />
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,730<br />
and this doe just jumped right in front of the bike.<br />
<br />
741<br />
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,530<br />
I had a chance to say one word. It was "Fuck" and I hit it.<br />
<br />
742<br />
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:14,130<br />
I know if the bullet comes with my name on it,<br />
<br />
743<br />
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,370<br />
I won't call for my mother!<br />
<br />
744<br />
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,640<br />
But man, the only reason I'm alive now<br />
<br />
745<br />
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:25,160<br />
is due to the big FL front end, and that tyres on my Fat Boy.<br />
<br />
746<br />
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:30,360<br />
-Oh, your Fat Boy.    -Exactly. I had on the Fat Boy.<br />
<br />
747<br />
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:33,150<br />
I saw the ground and I thought "Mm, put it down."<br />
<br />
748<br />
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,490<br />
I rode the bike down into the ground.<br />
<br />
749<br />
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,570<br />
Did perfect...<br />
<br />
750<br />
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,160<br />
-You've told me this.    -Did I?<br />
<br />
751<br />
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,550<br />
-Yeah, you did.    -I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
752<br />
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:44,330<br />
But I'll hear it again.<br />
<br />
753<br />
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,910<br />
Oh, you're sweet.<br />
<br />
754<br />
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,580<br />
God, you are wonderful.<br />
<br />
755<br />
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,080<br />
What's the matter?<br />
<br />
756<br />
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:55,510<br />
Nothing. It must be hard to pass on this road, huh?<br />
<br />
757<br />
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,050<br />
Oh, the freeway's faster but it lacks a certain majesty.<br />
<br />
758<br />
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:04,750<br />
It's just the car behind us has been following for a while.<br />
<br />
759<br />
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,070<br />
I sure hope so.<br />
<br />
760<br />
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,370<br />
Where is Big Sur?<br />
<br />
761<br />
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,330<br />
Up the coast.<br />
<br />
762<br />
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,130<br />
How far?<br />
<br />
763<br />
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:35,550<br />
I don't know. Uh, a few hours, I guess. Why?<br />
<br />
764<br />
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,530<br />
That's where he's scarpered.<br />
<br />
765<br />
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,140<br />
-How do you know?    -Bloke told me.<br />
<br />
766<br />
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,830<br />
You shouldn't go back to your place.<br />
<br />
767<br />
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,980<br />
Not till this is settled.<br />
<br />
768<br />
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,230<br />
What's a sliding scale?<br />
<br />
769<br />
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,150<br />
A sliding scale? Well, it's... um...<br />
<br />
770<br />
01:03:56,830 --> 01:04:01,410<br />
If we were in a union, we'd make different rates<br />
<br />
771<br />
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,620<br />
based on the time we served.<br />
<br />
772<br />
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:06,540<br />
-So, he's been... ...That's not a sliding scale.<br />
<br />
773<br />
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:08,670<br />
-What?    -That's not it.<br />
<br />
774<br />
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,380<br />
Well, what's a sliding scale?<br />
<br />
775<br />
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,460<br />
A sliding scale is...<br />
<br />
776<br />
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:17,950<br />
The scale, you know, you start somewhere and you move up.<br />
<br />
777<br />
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,510<br />
Or down.<br />
<br />
778<br />
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,390<br />
That's a sliding scale.<br />
<br />
779<br />
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,560<br />
-He doesn't know.    -You move down?<br />
<br />
780<br />
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,620<br />
Dog shit cues.<br />
<br />
781<br />
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:33,230<br />
I swear I could get a branch outside<br />
<br />
782<br />
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,940<br />
straighter than this thing.<br />
<br />
783<br />
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,120<br />
Stacy!<br />
<br />
784<br />
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,580<br />
Go ahead, break 'em up.<br />
<br />
785<br />
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,560<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
786<br />
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,380<br />
I just got chewed out. You believe that?<br />
<br />
787<br />
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,090<br />
What does he want?<br />
<br />
788<br />
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,030<br />
I said, "What do you want?"<br />
<br />
789<br />
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,630<br />
"You didn't say there were these Negroes following him, too."<br />
<br />
790<br />
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:07,440<br />
-Something's on, man.    -What?<br />
<br />
791<br />
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,980<br />
Well, let's say I know more about Mister Avery<br />
<br />
792<br />
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,340<br />
than he thinks I do about him and his 'operation'.<br />
<br />
793<br />
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:17,940<br />
-I got a guy on the inside.    -Who's that?<br />
<br />
794<br />
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,750<br />
Know that putz, Tom, from Seattle?<br />
<br />
795<br />
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:23,620<br />
-Tom... Tom Johanssen?    -Yeah, from Seattle.<br />
<br />
796<br />
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:26,660<br />
-I sent him to Avery.    -What he say?<br />
<br />
797<br />
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:29,330<br />
They're taking a trip up the coast.<br />
<br />
798<br />
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,830<br />
Him, Avery, a couple of guys.<br />
<br />
799<br />
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,750<br />
-We hit this guy again?    -Yeah.<br />
<br />
800<br />
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:38,340<br />
If he hasn't gotten whacked, we might have our aces.<br />
<br />
801<br />
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:42,150<br />
I just can't figure out who this guy is, you know?<br />
<br />
802<br />
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,630<br />
A courier. A buyer. Seller.<br />
<br />
803<br />
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,440<br />
Anyway, Avery wants him.<br />
<br />
804<br />
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,650<br />
Those jigs wanted him.<br />
<br />
805<br />
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,730<br />
You can bet your ass there's a briefcase somewhere.<br />
<br />
806<br />
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:56,780<br />
A briefcase.<br />
<br />
807<br />
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,280<br />
What's in it?<br />
<br />
808<br />
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:00,820<br />
Drugs, cash. Both if we're lucky.<br />
<br />
809<br />
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:05,180<br />

Another one?<br />

01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,980<br />
Different characters nowadays.<br />
<br />
824<br />
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:19,650<br />
Different assumptions.<br />
<br />
825<br />
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:22,230<br />
You don't know where you are.<br />
<br />
826<br />
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,120<br />
The last load of friends I had...<br />
<br />
827<br />
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:28,240<br />
Well...<br />
<br />
828<br />
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,440<br />
it turned out they weren't my friends after all.<br />
<br />
829<br />
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,720<br />
Elaine, do you ever understand half the shit this guy says?<br />
<br />
830<br />
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:48,820<br />
No, but I know what he means.<br />
<br />
831<br />
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,170<br />
I should be in Paris or Kurdistan.<br />
<br />
832<br />
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,710<br />
No, he'd find you in Kurdistan.<br />
<br />
833<br />
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,260<br />
Why not London? He has a history of being apprehended there.<br />
<br />
834<br />
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,930<br />
You're a font of optimism.<br />
<br />
835<br />
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,020<br />
What else have your techies come up with?<br />
<br />
836<br />
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,060<br />
Terry, we're trying to hunt them down.<br />
<br />
837<br />
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,260<br />
My soldiers are out there. What more can I do?<br />
<br />
838<br />
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,940<br />
And if he comes here?<br />
<br />
839<br />
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:40,320<br />
And, what if he does?<br />
<br />
840<br />
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:43,870<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
841<br />
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,940<br />
So, you don't want to tell me about this?<br />
<br />
842<br />
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:56,930<br />
About being here with the bodyguards and everything.<br />
<br />
843<br />
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:03,360<br />
I don't suppose you've ever had anything like enemies.<br />
<br />
844<br />
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,350<br />
Well, I never went out for the cheerleading squad,<br />
<br />
845<br />
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,690<br />
and I never stole anyone's boyfriend that I know of.<br />
<br />
846<br />
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,740<br />
So no. I'd like to think not.<br />
<br />
847<br />
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,660<br />
You never will.<br />
<br />
848<br />
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,070<br />
Well, come on now.<br />
<br />
849<br />
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,380<br />
I don't want anybody limiting my possibilities.<br />
<br />
850<br />
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,040<br />
That won't happen either.<br />
<br />
851<br />
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:34,980<br />
This is... This is just a precaution.<br />
<br />
852<br />
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:41,760<br />
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to drag you along.<br />
<br />
853<br />
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:48,220<br />
I... I needed you to, um, I just don't...<br />
<br />
854<br />
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,720<br />
...You don't want to be alone?<br />
<br />
855<br />
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,630<br />
You see? You...<br />
<br />
856<br />
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:57,430<br />
You understand that about me already.<br />
<br />
857<br />
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,420<br />
Where is she?<br />
<br />
858<br />
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,540<br />
Terry... scattered her ashes from a boat.<br />
<br />
859<br />
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,960<br />
Buried at a private service. Private for who? Him?<br />
<br />
860<br />
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,730<br />
Jenny lived at the beach when she moved here.<br />
<br />
861<br />
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,780<br />
She loved the ocean.<br />
<br />
862<br />
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:44,940<br />
She was from an island.<br />
<br />
863<br />
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,920<br />
Shit!<br />
<br />
864<br />
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,610<br />
George Clooney comes to Venice<br />
<br />
865<br />
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,780<br />
as photographers and fans...<br />
<br />
866<br />
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:43,350<br />
Are you throwing the empty shells back in?<br />
<br />
867<br />
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:48,430<br />
-Feel better?    -Yeah.<br />
<br />
868<br />
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,450<br />
It's amazing here.<br />
<br />
869<br />
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:55,230<br />
We went out last night to this Italian restaurant<br />
<br />
870<br />
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,380<br />
and they start with...<br />
<br />
871<br />
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,750<br />
Check the news.<br />
<br />
872<br />
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,430<br />
Check the news.<br />
<br />
873<br />
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,140<br />
-Where's the remote?    -I dunno.<br />
<br />
874<br />
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,560<br />
Fuck.<br />
<br />
875<br />
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,070<br />
Where the hell is Rick?<br />
<br />
876<br />
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,560<br />
Hm?<br />
<br />
877<br />
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,270<br />
Shut off all the inside lights. I'll get Adhara.<br />
<br />
878<br />
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,540<br />
Stay away from the windows.<br />
<br />
879<br />
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,880<br />
Hey!<br />
<br />
880<br />
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,250<br />
You heard of knocking?<br />
<br />
881<br />
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,130<br />
Look, come with me.<br />
<br />
882<br />
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,120<br />
-Why?    -Please.<br />
<br />
883<br />
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:21,370<br />
-Look, you see that?    -What?<br />
<br />
884<br />
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:22,930<br />
That shadow.<br />
<br />
885<br />
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:24,360<br />
I don't see it.<br />
<br />
886<br />
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,430<br />
I told you to stay away from the windows.<br />
<br />
887<br />
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:30,290<br />
C'mon, everybody. In here.<br />
<br />
888<br />
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:33,150<br />
Behind the counter. Let's go.<br />
<br />
889<br />
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:34,870<br />
Let's go behind the counter.<br />
<br />
890<br />
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:36,840<br />
Terry.<br />
<br />
891<br />
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:40,710<br />
What is going on here?<br />
<br />
892<br />
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,880<br />
-We think somebody's here.    -What? We think?!<br />
<br />
893<br />
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,590<br />
-We can't find Rick and...    -Larry.<br />
<br />
894<br />
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,470<br />
-Call the cops.    -No!<br />
<br />
895<br />
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,970<br />
-Why not?    -I'm taking care of it.<br />
<br />
896<br />
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,930<br />
-It's nuts. I'll call the cops.    -No!<br />
<br />
897<br />
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,340<br />
Mr. Avery...<br />
<br />
898<br />
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,360<br />
Watch my back.<br />
<br />
899<br />
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,780<br />
Son of a bitch.<br />
<br />
900<br />
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,160<br />
Aahhh!<br />
<br />
901<br />
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,240<br />
-Pow!    -What is it?<br />
<br />
902<br />
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,540<br />
I think Avery's down.<br />
<br />
903<br />
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,250<br />
Fuck this.<br />
<br />
904<br />
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,940<br />
Ah!<br />
<br />
905<br />
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,660<br />
Ah! Don't! I'm a friend of Stacy's.<br />
<br />
906<br />
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,960<br />
Huh, Fuck you, Tom.<br />
<br />
907<br />
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:34,060<br />
Oh! Shit.<br />
<br />
908<br />
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,140<br />
-Stay.    -What?<br />
<br />
909<br />
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,920<br />
Where are you going?<br />
<br />
910<br />
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:52,930<br />
Jesus.<br />
<br />
911<br />
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:39,580<br />
Tell me.<br />
<br />
912<br />
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,320<br />
Tell me about Jenny!<br />
<br />
913<br />
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,410<br />
Tell me about Jenny.<br />
<br />
914<br />
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:54,370<br />
Tell me about Jenny!<br />
<br />
915<br />
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,130<br />
I needed money.<br />
<br />
916<br />
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:59,120<br />
I would have given her anything she wanted.<br />
<br />
917<br />
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:02,950<br />
But she found out about my deal.<br />
<br />
918<br />
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,760<br />
She tried to stop me.<br />
<br />
919<br />
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,870<br />
Said she was gonna turn me in.<br />
<br />
920<br />
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,520<br />
Said she was gonna call the cops.<br />
<br />
921<br />
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:13,390<br />
I couldn't stop it.<br />
<br />
922<br />
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,030<br />
Had already happened. It was over.<br />
<br />
923<br />
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,570<br />
She was gonna call the cops.<br />
<br />
924<br />
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,980<br />
She meant it.<br />
<br />
925<br />
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,670<br />
She had the phone in her hand.<br />
<br />
926<br />
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,940<br />
She was gonna call the cops.<br />
<br />
927<br />
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,860<br />
She meant it.<br />
<br />
928<br />
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:30,980<br />
I couldn't stop it.<br />
<br />
929<br />
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:34,940<br />
I couldn't do anything.<br />
<br />
930<br />
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:10,240<br />
Ta.<br />
<br />
931<br />
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:14,520<br />
You're English.<br />
<br />
932<br />
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:17,370<br />
Yeah, that's right.<br />
<br />
933<br />
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:20,190<br />
I can never decide what I like better.<br />
<br />
934<br />
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,670<br />
Leaving home or coming back.<br />
<br />
935<br />
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:30,120<br />
I prefer staying 'ome, me.<br />
<br />
936<br />
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:34,850<br />
Oh, so you're a reluctant traveller?<br />
<br />
937<br />
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,820<br />
Got called out to LA unexpected-like.<br />
<br />
938<br />
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,620<br />
Do a job of work.<br />
<br />
939<br />
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,370<br />
No rest for the wicked.<br />
<br />
940<br />
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,160<br />
Been away a lot.<br />
<br />
941<br />
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,130<br />
Where else?<br />
<br />
942<br />
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:05,150<br />
Out on a an oil rig in the North Sea.<br />
<br />
943<br />
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,780<br />
Nine years.<br />
<br />
944<br />
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:11,780<br />
Nine years? Wow, is that legal?<br />
<br />
945<br />
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:15,870<br />
Well, time off for good behaviour.<br />
<br />
946<br />
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,370<br />
I shouldn't have even been there.<br />
<br />
947<br />
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,540<br />
It was these other lads<br />
<br />
948<br />
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:24,540<br />
what should have been in my place.<br />
<br />
949<br />
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:29,550<br />
And then just when I finish me nine years...<br />

<br />
951<br />
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:37,360<br />
I had to bugger off to the States.<br />
<br />
952<br />
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:42,290<br />
Well, it sounds like you need a rest.<br />
<br />
953<br />
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:48,040<br />
Yeah, could be.<br />
