1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,620
Tell me...

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,300
Tell me!

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,940
Tell me about Jenny.

4
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,000
- Edward Roel?
- Eduardo Roel.

5
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,540
Edward Roel?

6
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,360
- Eduardo Roel.
- You're home, then.

7
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,080
My name's Wilson.

8
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,780
Wilson?

9
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,920
You wrote me
about my daughter.

10
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,540
Oh, uh... yeah, come in.

11
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,140
- Who done it, then?
- Huh?

12
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,360
- Snuffed her?
- What are you talkin' about?

13
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,680
I sent you
the newspaper clipping, OK.

14
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,820
I tell you what I know.

15
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,180
I never said
anyone was snuffed.

16
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,500
There was an investigation, OK?

17
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,060
The car was stolen.
Jenny was...

18
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,820
Her neck was broken,
on impact.

19
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,060
She wouldn't have felt
the effects of the fire.

20
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Those streets up them hills,
you gotta' be careful.

21
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,320
Gotta keep your eyes
on the ball.

22
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,140
Two o'clock in the morning,
it's dark, your mind's agitated.

23
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,140
You're driving too fast.

24
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,460
Those curves
don't kid around.

25
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,260
Could've happened
to anybody.

26
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,260
I didn't know her to be reckless

27
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,140
but she'd have a drink
and smoke pot and that was it.

28
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,260
No, not my girl.

29
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,980
Self-control, she had.

30
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,400
It was a point of pride.

31
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,360
Where did she get it?
This grass or whatever.

32
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,980
Oh, no. Look, I am no
drug dealer. What do you think?

33
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,900
You didn't get that
ink doing National Service.

34
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,780
I already told you.
Corcoran, you know.

35
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,740
You know what that is?
State prison.

36
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,460
I did my time. My sister's man
is in Chino, doin' eight years.

37
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,740
I go to work.
I put my life together.

38
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,340
Put all that shit behind me.

39
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,480
Five years in the joint!
That's it!

40
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,120
I just got out meself,
didn't I?

41
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,300
This bloke
she was bunked up with,

42
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,260
- Terry Whatsit...
- Terry Valentine.

43
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,040
What's he got to say
for himself?

44
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,500
I dunno.
What he gonna say?

45
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,140
They had a fight,
she drove away. She was upset.

46
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,020
Couple of weeks
before Jenny died,

47
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,260
she asked me
to drive her downtown.

48
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,480
She said she wanted to talk
to her boyfriend, Valentine.

49
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,540
I think
she was looking for him.

50
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,740
To catch him
with another bird?

51
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,820
Exactly,
that's what I thought,

52
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,660
but we didn't go to no hotel.

53
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,540
- We went someplace else. -
Whereabouts?

54
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Some bad place,
bad people.

55
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,300
Some guy unloading trucks.
Some kind of deal going down.

56
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,860
I dunno and I don't care, OK?

57
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,420
Could've been shipping
fava beans to Eskimos.'

58
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,820
Did Jenny know?

59
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,860
Valentine wasn't
there, so...

60
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,320
if he was involved, or she was,
who knows?

61
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,460
But I wanna tell you...

62
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
Jenny stood
right in front of those guys,

63
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,680
eyeballing them,
checking them out.

64
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,060
It felt like
she was covering MY ass.

65
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,100
I can't believe that.

66
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,580
Really? What'd she say?

67
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,940
Hang on.

68
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,500
Can I help you?

69
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,620
You can't be
too careful nowadays.

70
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,780
- Lot of tea leaves about.
- Excuse me?

71
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,220
Tea leaves. Thieves.
Terry Valentine. D'you know him?

72
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,300
And... who are you?

73
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,100
- Wilson. My name's Wilson.
- Well, Wilson, to start...

74
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,580
- I never heard of you.
- I'm not that well known.

75
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,380
Except in except some districts,
some police nicks.

76
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,380
- Police what?
- Me? No. Can't be bothered.

77
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,700
Who the fuck are you?
How did you get in here?

78
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,700
Only a little bird
told me

79
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,220
that you and Terry Valentine
have business dealings...

80
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,700
I don't know anybody
named Terry Valentine.

81
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,540
- Don't you?
- Now, take a walk, pal.

82
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,180
You're making a big mistake.
Get the hell out of here.

83
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,040
Hey!

84
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,100
What you been up to, pal?

85
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,480
What you been doing?
You got to buck your ideas up.

86
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,900
What you been doing?

87
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,260
Jennifer Wilson.
Jennifer Wilson...

88
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,420
- That name mean anything?
- What's the deal here?

89
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,500
Hold on. What the hell...
Who is this guy?

90
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,660
The only reason
you're not dead

91
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,540
is I want to find out
who the fuck you are.

92
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,020
Jennifer Wilson
was my daughter.

93
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,420
- Who the fuck is...
- Wasn't she the chick

94
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,060
that showed up down here?

95
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,260
Yeah, talked the same
as this cocksucker.

96
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,020
Terry Valentine
is a friend of mine.

97
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,020
I don't talk about my friends
with strangers.

98
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,700
But that cunt daughter of yours,
she come here,

99
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,500
sticking her tits in my face.
Who am I? How do I know Terry?

100
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,980
What's the nature
of our business together?

101
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,620
I admire Terry a lot, but I
gotta say,

102
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:21,260
he let himself get royally
pussy-whipped by that bitch.

103
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,100
You know what I would
like to have done to her?

104
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,460
You know what I would
like to have done?

105
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,180
I bet she
would've like that.

106
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,660
Too bad she had to take
a nosedive off that cliff.

107
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,540
Probably dried her all up.

108
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,900
Got him!

109
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,220
Keep your cool.

110
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,940
Get him out.

111
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,740
- You want to call an ambulance?
- NO!

112
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,140
Call Avery.

113
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,660
Go, man!
Just get outta here.

114
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,620
Come back here, Pop,
and we'll kill you.

115
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
Understand?
This is private property.

116
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,460
We'll shoot you, fuck-o.
Get it?

117
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,500
Fuckin' old fart coming here.
BIG, dangerous gun!

118
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,620
We're quakin'!
We're quakin'!

119
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,780
Yeah. Shit!

120
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,380
Hey, you come back
and visit and trespass.

121
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,620
We look forward to it, asshole.
Stupid English fuck!

122
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,740
Hey! What...

123
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,060
What the...

124
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,760
You tell him!
You tell him I'm coming.

125
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,620
Tell him I'm fucking coming!

126
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,940
Tell 'em I'm coming?

127
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,580
"Tell HIM I'm coming."

128
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,540
- Who?
- Nobody knows.

129
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,720
Adhara.

130
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,320
I remember telling your parents,
if you're looking for a name,

131
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,160
you can't go wrong
with a constellation.

132
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,520
I used to hate it.
Now I like it.

133
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,200
It could be worse.
They could have called you...

134
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,520
Reticulum, Pleiades.

135
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,880
God, you're beautiful.

136
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,720
Is there anything
in this world you want or need?

137
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,480
I want to know why you need
that scary man here.

138
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,920
Gordon?
He's been with me for years.

139
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,840
He's not as tough as he looks.

140
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,920
- Then what good is he?
- Heard of loyalty?

141
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,440
Yeah... I'm loyal to things
that make me happy.

142
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,800
- Oh, am I a "thing"?
- You're certainly not a person.

143
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,720
- I'm not?
- No.

144
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,800
You're not specific enough
to be a person.

145
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,960
You're more like a vibe.

146
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,680
God, I'm glad we're having
this little chat. Come here.

147
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,520
Get out of the pool.

148
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,200
Terry.

149
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,120
I don't know
what transpired exactly.

150
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,600
- What?
- Our friends downtown.

151
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,160
Someone took them out.

152
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,520
Took them out?
What the fuck does that mean?

153
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,000
It used to mean, it was similar
to a gangland slaying.

154
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,560
- Maybe it still is.
- Well... well, who?

155
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
- Well...
- Blacks?

156
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,080
Blacks? No Terry,
it's not their style.

157
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,280
No, from what I gather,
it was a lone gunman.

158
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,240
You sound like the 5 o'clock
news. Why tell me this shit?

159
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,720
If you don't know,

160
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,800
I didn't want you to hear it
and then freak out.

161
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,920
Fuck you, Jim.
I don't freak out any more.

162
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,280
Well, it's probably nothing.

163
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,000
It's what senseless mayhem
comes down to, isn't it?

164
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Bad loan, bad judgement,
bad faith.

165
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,920
These were bad people,
involved with worse people.

166
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,680
Cops got leads.

167
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,840
Great, as long as nobody
connects anything to me.

168
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,720
No one'll connect
it to you.

169
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,640
That was a one-off deal,
like a moving freight train.

170
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,240
Anything else,
I would've had you walk away.

171
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,960
- You never saw them again.
- Are you crazy?

172
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,040
They're your friends,
not mine.

173
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,360
What?
Your "clients"?

174
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,280
I befriended them
when you needed them.

175
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,560
Well, the cops.
I mean, you know, I'm...

176
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,880
Are they satisfied with this...
gangland shit, or what?

177
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,800
You know the cops don't get
satisfied. They get placated.

178
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,640
They're talking
to the kid who got away.

179
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,960
The kid who called me.
Well, I called them...

180
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,560
Scared out of his wits.

181
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,240
All he can say is that
the shooter is some crazy guy.

182
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,960
"Shooter"?
Jesus Christ.

183
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Yeah, he said
he went nuts.

184
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,040
He was yelling and screaming,
"Tell him I'm coming."

185
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,760
"Tell 'em I'm coming?"

186
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,600
"Tell HIM I'm coming."

187
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,400
Who?

188
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,560
Nobody knows.

189
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,840
Great. This is sure
making the fuck out of my day.

190
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,200
Terry, relax,
would you, please.

191
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
The goods are long gone.
Money's been turned around.

192
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,800
Middlemen are dead.
This is a good thing.

193
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,760
So, don't panic, OK?

194
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,980
No one can link
anybody to you.

195
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,500
Jenny did.

196
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,980
Yeah, well,
Jenny could.

197
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,560
She'd already got to you.

198
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,560
Terry Valentine...
D'you know him?

199
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,080
Valentine came into
the restaurant sometimes.

200
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,460
The guy's a money guy.

201
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,240
They were together
how long?

202
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,280
Five years.
A long time.

203
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,920
There you go.
Jenny must've liked him.

204
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,800
Jenny would say,
"Here's my friend Eddie."

205
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,320
He'd shake my hand but
wouldn't even see me, you know?

206
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,120
Jenny met him at a beach,
got blinded by his smile.

207
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,760
You believe that? Son of
a bitch never smiled at me.

208
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,960
Jenny and I were friends,

209
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,400
but we didn't travel in the
same social circles, you know?

210
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
She had her life.
I had mine.

211
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,240
How'd you two hook up then?

212
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,560
Jenny was
in my acting class.

213
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,530
She was 21
when she came to me.

214
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,190
Straight from leaving you.

215
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,430
You should talk to Elaine.
That was her best friend.

216
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,070
I do double duty
as a voice coach.

217
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,390
Not that her accent
would've hobbled her progress.

218
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,530
Not with that look.

219
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,870
She didn't write me,
did she?

220
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,830
She didn't
know what to say.

221
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,750
I figured somebody should say
something to someone.

222
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,070
You're Jenny's father.

223
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,630
Why did you come here?

224
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,550
Thought it'd be nice to have
a chat with you, that's all.

225
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,310
No...

226
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,790
Why did you come here?

227
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,270
Get a few things
sorted out.

228
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,150
Been busy, have you?

229
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,270
How do you mean?

230
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,030
I heard you were...

231
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,430
What is that adorable
expression...

232
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,790
at Her Majesty's pleasure.

233
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,990
It was the bars, then.

234
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,430
What was it, uh,
Wembley Stadium job?

235
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:10,050
That was it, right?
Pink Floyd concert receipts.

236
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,970
Earning interest
in an offshore account.

237
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,550
Tidy little premium
per annum, that.

238
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,130
Security like that
can't be bought.

239
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,310
Must be more comforting than
having a daughter to greet you.

240
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,750
Oi, ain't you gonna
let me in?

241
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,110
You can call me again.

242
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,430
Weren't you in a soap
on the box?

243
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,870
Three Seasons.
Who told you that? Eddie?

244
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,510
Yeah, Eddie. Yeah.
He's my new china.

245
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,030
- Ch... What?
- China plate, mate. Me and him.

246
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,470
Quite a character,
isn't he?

247
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,710
Not to you. To us squares
in the outside world.

248
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,030
He give me your address.

249
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,710
I gave him yours. I guess
I was being loyal to Jenny,

250
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,370
who told me
she didn't have a father.

251
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,070
Before, of course,
proceeding to tell me why.

252
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,550
Yeah... Well...

253
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,710
She was right in a way.

254
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,790
Her mum died when she was six.

255
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,830
After that she was on her own.

256
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,750
Aunts and uncles and then...

257
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,550
How can you keep her down on
the farm after she's seen L.A.?

258
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,630
I got compassionate leave
from Parkhurst

259
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,350
to see her in hospital.

260
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,830
Cos we was always mates,

261
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,490
Jenny's mum and me.

262
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,350
I like to think
they're together now, you know?

263
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,610
Heavenly choir.

264
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,870
That's where
you got the word?

265
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,110
That's where Eddie wrote you,
in prison?

266
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,950
Oh, no, no. I knew.
I knew before Ed.

267
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,990
Uh...

268
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,750
What time was it
supposed to have happened?

269
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,270
Eddie said...
two in the morning.

270
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,870
That's eight hours difference
between here and London,

271
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,230
that would have made it about
like... ten o'clock my time.

272
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,310
I was going out
in the yard.

273
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,470
I was in the habit of saving
my newspaper till then.

274
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,910
Stretch me legs,

275
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,750
breath of fresh air,
bit of a read,

276
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,310
stretch out the good part
of the day.

277
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,590
And I couldn't open
the newspaper.

278
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,750
It was like the pages
was glued together.

279
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,350
Me hands were that weak.

280
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,230
I thought I was havin'
a heart attack.

281
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,910
Course I know I wasn't.

282
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,590
Guy I knew come up.

283
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,270
"Here, Wilson", he said,
"You're as white as a sheet."

284
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,390
I said, "Fuck me, I've
been in prison half me life."

285
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,550
But he was dead-on. I'd felt all
the blood drain out of me head.

286
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,150
And I knew...

287
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,370
Huh, I knew something
must've happened to Jen.

288
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,270
She was... magic.

289
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,790
I can't believe Jenny
told you all that about me.

290
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,090
She was always
so embarrassed.

291
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,590
Not embarrassed.

292
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,570
Ashamed?

293
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,270
Not ashamed.

294
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,050
Disappointed.

295
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,550
Do you even know
who Terry Valentine is?

296
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,950
Some pop music producer,
isn't he?

297
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,870
Rock and roll
we call it.

298
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,190
Kind of a promoter,
I guess.

299
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,750
Whatever that means.

300
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,150
He took the whole

301
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,430
'60s Southern California
zeitgeist and ran with it.

302
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,890
Packaged and sold it.

303
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,590
Made out like a bandit.

304
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,950
What's the deal, hm?

305
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,910
You and Terry Valentine
at 20 paces? Come on.

306
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,150
Is that it?

307
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,670
- I don't see why not.
- Are you serious?

308
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,070
Have you ever known me
not to be?

309
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,570
You fucking guys
and your dicks, man.

310
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,870
What do you expect me to do?

311
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,470
Stay at home doing sweet F.A.?

312
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,150
You don't believe
it was a car accident?

313
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,590
Oh, yeah!

314
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,870
She fell asleep
at the wheel!

315
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,950
Terry is never gonna give
you that satisfaction.

316
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,150
He is NOT the type.

317
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,470
- Depends, dunnit?
- On what?

318
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,450
What makes you so certain?

319
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,950
I bloody ask 'im.

320
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,150
Fine, there's the phone.

321
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,050
Want his number?

322
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,810
I've got his number!

323
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,790
Whatever you gotta do, man.
Better go do it.

324
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,390
Looks like he's brought in
the 'eavy mob.

325
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,030
- You're kidding me?
- Extra muscle. Bodyguards.

326
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,110
They look a right load of
wallies.

327
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,990
You should see 'em.
Patrolling up and down there.

328
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,150
Let me see.

329
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,030
Done up like fucking household
cavalry.

330
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,270
Those are valets, man.

331
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,070
Valets? What do you mean,
valets? Who does he think he is?

332
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,390
The Marquess
of fuckin' Tavistock?

333
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,190
Valets, man. They park cars.
They're having a party.

334
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,030
Are they?

335
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,070
Thank you.

336
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,150
Oi! Trousers, keep it 'andy.
We're not gonna be staying long.

337
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,690
- Yes, sir.
- Vengo ahora.

338
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,550
Boy, we're a little early, huh?

339
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,690
Well, first in, first out.
That's me.

340
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,870
Good evening.

341
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,270
Mind how you go.

342
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,850
Gentlemen,
what can I get you?

343
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,470
Babycham.
Eduardo...

344
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,830
Do you want it
with a twist?

345
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,250
Tomato juice
with Tabasco.

346
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,670
I'll have a coke.

347
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,830
You have
the same posters.

348
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,550
- What?
- That you have at your office.

349
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,390
No, they're different.

350
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,550
- Well, I like the colours.
- We all did.

351
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,470
Hmm, must have been a time, huh?

352
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,010
In golden moment.

353
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,590
Have you ever dreamed
about a place...

354
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,350
you never really
recalled being to before?

355
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,450
A place that maybe only exists
in your imagination?

356
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,310
Some place far away,

357
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,210
half-remembered
when you wake up.

358
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,750
When you were there, though,
you knew the language.

359
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,710
You knew your way around.

360
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,990
That was the '60s.

361
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,950
No, it wasn't that, either.

362
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:59,110
It was just '66
and early '67.

363
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,270
That's all it was.

364
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,910
I'm gonna have a butcher's
round the house.

365
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,550
Who you gonna butcher?

366
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,470
Butcher's hook, 'look'.

367
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,710
Butcher's... look. Hm.

368
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,070
Mm, try one of these.

369
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,710
No, I don't like that.
Try one of these.

370
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,270
Hi.

371
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,510
- Terry. How you doing?
- Great, how you doing?

372
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,070
- Very well, thank you.
- Good to see you.

373
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,390
Our counterfeit CDs
are doing well...

374
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,910
Do I know you?

375
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,030
It was meant to be an infinity
pool and go off the edge.

376
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,910
- Definitely business affairs.
- Terry Valentine.

377
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,790
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

378
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,970
Shit.

379
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,290
Hello? Hey.

380
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,750
No, it's Crestview Terrace,
not Crestview Place.

381
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,230
Yeah. No, there's three
different ways up the hill.

382
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,630
The best way
is to take Loma Vista.

383
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,350
Loma Lin...
Loma Linda.

384
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,590
Yeah.

385
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,590
Yes.

386
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,590
OK. All right, bye.

387
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,190
Hi, how you doing?
Good to see you.

388
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,950
- Well, you know...
- Unbelievable.

389
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,310
It's the record business.
What can you say?

390
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,910
- It's the 'how-are-you' crowd.
- The 'how-are-you' crowd...

391
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,230
There you are.

392
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,810
- Well, you know Jim.
- Of course. We know.

393
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,010
Blimey!

394
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,350
If you can afford a house
like this you buy one.

395
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,270
What are we standing on?

396
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,510
Trust.

397
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,870
You know, you could see
the sea out there

398
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,510
if you could see it.

399
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,830
Could yer?

400
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,270
Mm.
Where are you going?

401
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,670
Hello?

402
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,390
The pool's hot, too,
if you want to.

403
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,030
Well, you know...

404
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,830
No, we're not
doing this.

405
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,470
You produced the first
Christopher Cross album?

406
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,670
Come on,
come on.

407
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,710
What was he like, huh?

408
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:35,150
- Just give me a bit, a nugget.
- I just do the contracts.

409
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,270
- That's it?
- Yeah, just the contracts.

410
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,730
Bring the motor round.
Bang out front.

411
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,330
Oi!

412
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,590
Point it downhill.

413
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,590
As I was driving down Melrose,
taking a left on Seward,

414
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,070
I saw this guy locking a car,
so unmarked it was marked.

415
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,470
I mean it was just, w...

416
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,590
- There's a guy down there.
- Call the police.

417
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,190
No, no.

418
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,430
Dame la llave,
gracias, gracias.

419
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,550
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

420
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,470
Ahh!

421
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,490
Go, go.

422
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,970
Are you OK?

423
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,630
Steady on, Fangio.

424
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,470
Man, you steady on!
What the fuck you do?

425
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,150
You didn't cap the guy,
did you?

426
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,630
Did you?

427
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,910
That would have been too easy.

428
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,990
- Too easy?
- He's gotta know why.

429
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,870
You think a guy like that
ever will?

430
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,750
- Down!
- Whoa!

431
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,830
Whoa!

432
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,430
Fuck!

433
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,030
Wilson, Wilson! Wilson!

434
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,910
Come on, man!

435
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,830
Come on, come on, come on.

436
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,630
Shit!

437
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,410
Wilson.

438
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,950
Oh, boy.

439
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,590
Should have let ME
do the talking.

440
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,790
Cos you're my
security consultant?

441
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,190
What's going on?

442
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,310
- What did you say?
- I said an employee flipped.

443
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,870
That he had drug problems,
and he refused counselling...

444
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,350
which is true...
And he committed suicide.

445
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,150
One of the guests
tried to stop him.

446
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,150
Jim, how the fuck do you stop
Gordon at 400 pounds?

447
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,230
That was good, that was good.

448
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,270
- He's heavier now, isn't he?
- Oh!

449
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,990
Jenny never told you
about her dad.

450
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,870
Oh, what dad,
what dad?

451
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:56,550
He was in prison nine years
and was released last month.

452
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,670
Jenny's father was in prison?

453
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,430
For what?

454
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,110
- Armed robbery. Again.
- Again? Oh, my God.

455
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,110
Yeah, he a career criminal.
On leave of absence. Get it?

456
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,870
Where are you going?

457
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,830
Don't you think
I outta find him before they do?

458
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:17,110
Oh, man.
I am screwed.

459
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,110
I'm screwed to the wall!

460
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,630
He never entered the country
under his own name.

461
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,190
Give me a fucking break, man,
can you?

462
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,510
Well, I would if I came
this far to kill someone.

463
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,910
Oh, man.

464
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:36,790
OK, not even one of your guys
should handle this.

465
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,150
Do you want me
to tell them?

466
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,150
No, I mean...

467
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,070
I told them I didn't know
who the guy was.

468
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,310
People come, people go.
How are you gonna find him?

469
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,390
Terry, he's not
James Bond, you know?

470
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,550
- This is a pathetic sad sack...
- Tell that to Gordon.

471
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,470
What's England? Some country
half the size of Wyoming

472
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,270
where the cops
don't even carry guns?

473
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,870
This is getting
too close to me.

474
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,070
You know something? People
close to you fall into canyons.

475
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,350
Oh, well now,
that's brilliant.

476
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,990
Hey, relax.

477
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,430
I have other resources.
I have other resources.

478
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,470
No-one even
near to me

479
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,470
because I am out of here.

480
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,810
I'm gone.

481
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,870
How are you
so lucky, Terry?

482
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,730
I learned how to skate
as a little boy.

483
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,590
Well, you know...

484
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,350
Half a dozen interventions
if a person won't face up to it.

485
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,990
I guess not.

486
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,470
People in this industry are
taken down by doing too many...

487
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,210
...many...

488
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,250
...drugs.

489
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,830
Straight rotation,
no bullshit, call your shots.

490
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,070
- Scratch the eight, you lose.
- That's good.

491
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,190
- Let me break, right?
- Yeah, break 'em up.

492
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,050
- He broke last time.
- What did you say?

493
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,030
I said he broke last time.

494
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,270
So what. Look at him.
He loves to break.

495
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,350
Look, he's all excited.

496
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,670
I don't give a shit if he likes
to break, it's my break.

497
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,430
I won the break.

498
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,030
- I won the break!
- What's the fuck is that?

499
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,750
- Are these your quarters there?
- Yeah.

500
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,390
- What's he doin'?
- I dunno.

501
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,190
Go and fuck yourself,
and take Mr Goodwrench with you.

502
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,030
Blow it out your arse,
but my dick's in the way.

503
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:56,110
Did I cross the line?

504
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,250
Does that mean you forfeit?

505
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,630
- Just wanted to play a game.
- Stacy!

506
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:09,750
Come over here.

507
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,870
How's it going, kid?

508
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,830
Not bad.

509
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,630
- Could you kill someone for me?
- OK.

510
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,430
Same as last time.
The rest after.

511
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,430
Where do we go?

512
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,070
When you find the guy
you'll know.

513
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,070
I just do it.
I don't organise it.

514
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:54,230
I'll point you there, but you
take it to the end zone.

515
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,470
A hit-and-run gunman.

516
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,950
I figure he's not cruisin'
the polo lounge.

517
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,550
This is unprofessional, man.

518
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:06,150
Well, you see a successful man
like me has limitations.

519
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,950
I lose touch with the street.
I depend on smart boys like you.

520
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,270
You're closer
to the nitty gritty...

521
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,130
Fuck you, mister,
all right?

522
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,550
This is a lifestyle
I embrace.

523
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,950
So you take care of this.

524
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:25,830
You see, I'm the one
with appearances to maintain.

525
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,790
But who gives a shit about you?

526
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,430
Not even God.

527
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,070
Get it done.

528
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,270
Get a tie.

529
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,870
- How much?
- Five grand.

530
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,390
- Hey!
- Got half in my pocket.

531
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,510
- Making trouble for someone?
- Yup.

532
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,590
- Which kind?
- The forever kind.

533
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,950
Maybe she doesn't know
the English dude.

534
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,110
Avery said
she knew the guy's daughter.

535
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,150
That don't mean nothin'.

536
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:27,990
- She's nice lookin'.
- So what?

537
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,350
I just said
she's nice lookin'.

538
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,390
I said, "So what?"
Think she's any happier?

539
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,350
- What do you mean?
- Happier than other assholes.

540
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,870
I dunno,
I never met her.

541
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,190
Why don't they make
shows about people's daily lives

542
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,070
you'd be interested
in watching,

543
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:50,750
like sick old man or skinny
little weakling, or big fat guy?

544
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,590
I'd watch a show
called 'Big Fat Guy'.

545
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:57,470
Extras, excuse me,
'background artists'.

546
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,190
"Hey, Mom and Dad. How's it
goin'? Yeah, Hollywood's great."

547
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:02,590
"Yes, still a loser."

548
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:06,710
I wonder what
it's like to have tits.

549
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,030
Are you gay enough, or what?
"Hello, Studio City." Fag.

550
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,870
Look at this guy.
Yeah, they need that right away.

551
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,990
What's the smartest thing
to come out of a woman's mouth?

552
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,870
Einstein's cock.

553
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,110
That kid's cute, though.

554
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,270
Know what I mean?
She's a little young, but...

555
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:31,550
You wanna run
with me now?

556
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:35,630
Did you forget your words?

557
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,790
Step aside, ma'am.

558
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,710
Come with us.

559
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,290
Wasn't half crowded
in that car, wasn't it?

560
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,330
Drug enforcement?

561
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:39,550
Huh! Narcs?

562
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,710
God!

563
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,390
I don't suppose you'd prefer
a steady income?

564
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,430
I've got a steady income.

565
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,750
I'm on the dole.

566
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,790
A leech on the welfare state
in addition.

567
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,470
You don't miss a trick.

568
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,990
Just a fiddle.

569
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,630
They got me down
as an immigrant with five kids.

570
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:07,150
Huh, yeah. Jenny spoke fondly of
her imaginary siblings.

571
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,510
Do you even remember
the last time you saw her?

572
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,830
I remember every time
I saw her.

573
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,710
I watched her grow up.

574
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,390
In increments.

575
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:23,190
She told me
you were a ghost in her life.

576
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:27,110
Daddy, the friendly ghost.

577
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,750
Well, she twigged by the time
she was eight or nine

578
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,070
I wasn't in the Royal Marines

579
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:37,310
or playing lago
in a world tour of Othello.

580
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,390
She was always
threatening me.

581
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,150
Can you imagine?

582
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,750
"If you're naughty, Dad,

583
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:22,710
I'll put the law
on yer, promise."

584
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,150
She didn't want me
inside again, see?

585
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:29,430
And if she got wind
that I was planning something,

586
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,750
"I'll shop yer, Dad.
I promise, I'll shop yer."

587
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,950
I can see her
on the phone.

588
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:41,070
"Look, Dad. I'm calling
the Old Bill right now."

589
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,590
It became a sort
of joke between us,

590
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:47,470
only it wasn't really.

591
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:55,270
She never would've
turned you in.

592
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,110
Not in a million years.

593
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,830
Oh, I know that.

594
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,550
But as time went on,

595
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:06,990
when, in ever decreasing
circles, the joke wore off.

596
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:12,830
She had a feeling
'bout this last job.

597
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,670
How long I'd get
banged up for.

598
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,190
Said she wouldn't be
around this time

599
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,630
when I got out.

600
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:27,230
And she wasn't.

601
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,710
How you doin' then?
All right, are yer?

602
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:00,750
Look, squire. You're the
guv'nor 'ere, I can see that.

603
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,150
Don't get your knickers
in a twist.

604
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,590
Whatever this is,

605
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,550
going down between
you and Valentine,

606
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,550
it's nothin' to do with me.

607
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,110
Couldn't care less, OK, mate?

608
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:15,310
Let me explain. When I was
in prison, second time, er...

609
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,590
Er, no, tell a lie,
third stretch. Yep, third.

610
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,550
There was this screw
what really had it in for me.

611
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:25,150
That geezer was top
of my list.

612
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:27,990
Years later I sees
'im in Holland Park.

613
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,190
Sitting on a bench feeding
bloody pigeons.

614
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,510
I could have gone up behind him

615
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,950
and snapped his fucking neck.
Wallop. But I left it.

616
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,950
I could have,
but I didn't.

617
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,350
What I thought I wanted,
I didn't.

618
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:43,110
I was thinkin'
about something else.

619
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,430
I didn't give a toss, see?

620
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,390
This berk on the bench
wasn't worth my time.

621
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,550
It meant sod all in the end.

622
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,390
Choose when to do it
and when not to.

623
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,950
When it matters,
and when it don't.

624
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,150
Bide yer time. That's what
prison teaches if nothing else.

625
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,070
Bide yer time
and everything becomes clear.

626
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,930
And you can act accordingly.

627
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:11,550
There's one thing
I don't understand.

628
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:17,030
The thing I don't understand is
every fuckin' word you've said.

629
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,030
Do you know what I reckon?

630
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:29,550
You and I are after the same
thing but for different reasons.

631
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:33,190
- And what would that be?
- The reasons?

632
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,590
Start with the thing.

633
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:43,910
I imagine whatever you're after
involves a large sum of money.

634
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:47,190
And that's not what
lights your fire?

635
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:52,830
In the past, granted.
I have redistributed wealth.

636
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,590
But no, I'm after another kind

637
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,790
of satisfaction.

638
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,670
Do you know what I mean?

639
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:05,110
You're not from around here,
are you?

640
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,430
You're not carrying
any kind of ID.

641
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,310
Who me? ID? No. When your chaps
went through my pockets,

642
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,990
there was nothing there.

643
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:16,710
What's your connection
to Terry Valentine?

644
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:22,830
My daughter was living
with 'im when she died.

645
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,590
I imagine about the same time
as whatever the deal was,

646
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,270
that Terry Valentine grafted
you out of your share of.

647
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:33,390
- When I say grafted...
- You think...

648
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,350
Terry Valentine screwed me
out of some deal?

649
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:42,190
It wouldn't surprise me. He's as
straight as a dog's hind leg.

650
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,830
What could this deal have been,

651
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:51,750
to have set in motion such
an unfortunate chain of events.

652
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,830
Could've been anything.

653
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,150
Shit load of heroin imported
from somewhere or other.

654
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,550
The usual scumbags involved.

655
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,550
But the thing
about scumbags is...

656
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:05,350
no matter what they do with the
drugs, the harder thing to move

657
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,150
is the money.

658
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:10,710
In my line of work the best
thing to do is follow the money,

659
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,510
cos you can't hide the money.

660
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,110
You can only disguise it.
So you do what?

661
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:18,350
You find some rich fool
to bank all the cash.

662
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,190
Make it look legitimate

663
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:23,110
in exchange for skimming
a percentage off the top.

664
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,190
Maybe as much as a million
dollars commission.

665
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:29,230
Rich fool, who overextended
himself over time,

666
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,510
in danger of not being
so rich any more.

667
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:35,950
But I can't be sure.
Can't prove anything.

668
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,070
Anything at all.

669
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,310
What was your daughter's
involvement?

670
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:44,470
That's what I want to know.

671
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,990
I was hoping you might...

672
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,670
The security guard
that works for Valentine?

673
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,990
He's the one who sent
those creeps after you.

674
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:54,910
I shouldn't wonder.
Yeah, must've done.

675
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,550
He's quite a slippery fellow.

676
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:01,510
But he keeps his hands clean
and Valentine's.

677
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:08,950
Darn it, there go my...
slippery hands again.

678
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:23,390
There was an incident downtown
a couple of days ago

679
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:28,950
that may have spurred this...
most recent activity.

680
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:32,470
You don't know
about that, right?

681
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,150
Thank you.

682
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:44,550
Your daughter, she had
a fondness for dangerous men?

683
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,950
Shame about the money, though.

684
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:51,990
Going into Valentine's pocket
and not yours.

685
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,670
I don't give a shit
about the money.

686
00:57:54,910 --> 00:58:01,430
Personally, I prefer the heroin.

687
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,750
See, crooks move faster
than the system,

688
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:08,790
so if we're gonna clean up
the neighbourhood,

689
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:14,550
we don't have time for things
like search warrants and trials.

690
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:20,590
Procedure becomes whatever
you gotta do... on the day.

691
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:23,530
Uh-huh.

692
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:29,470
Er, cheers mate.

693
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,110
Go with God.

694
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:39,850
Yeah.

695
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:13,030
I was coming back from a
motorcycle classic in Sturgis,

696
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:19,390
South Dakota, on US Highway 14
just that side of Spotted Horse.

697
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,070
I ran into a deer,
I had no chance.

698
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:26,670
Though the highway patrol
had mowed the sides,

699
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,910
where the culverts were
they couldn't mow

700
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:32,190
and this doe just jumped
right in front of the bike.

701
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:36,090
I had a chance to say one word.
It was "Fuck" and I hit it.

702
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:40,170
I know if the bullet comes
with my name on it,

703
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,890
I won't call for my mother!

704
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:46,510
But man, the only reason
I'm alive now

705
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,410
is due to the big FL front end,
and that tyre on my Fat Boy.

706
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:55,830
- Oh, your Fat Boy.
- Exactly. I had on the Fat Boy.

707
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,510
I saw the ground and I thought
"Mm, put it down."

708
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,750
I rode the bike
down into the ground.

709
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:01,790
Did perfect...

710
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,270
- You've told me this.
- Did I?

711
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,430
- Yeah, you did.
- I'm sorry.

712
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,830
But I'll hear it again.

713
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:10,750
Oh, you're sweet.

714
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,310
God, you are wonderful.

715
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,750
What's the matter?

716
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:19,950
Nothing. It must be hard
to pass on this road, huh?

717
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:23,850
Oh, the freeway's faster
but it lacks a certain majesty.

718
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,990
It's just the car behind us
has been following for a while.

719
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,030
I sure hope so.

720
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,550
Where is Big Sur?

721
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,430
Up the coast.

722
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,150
How far?

723
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:58,350
I don't know.
Uh, a few hours, I guess. Why?

724
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,030
That's where
he's scarpered.

725
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,950
- How do you know?
- Bloke told me.

726
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,170
You shouldn't go back
to your place.

727
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,090
Not till this is settled.

728
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,310
What's
a sliding scale?

729
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:18,110
A sliding scale?
Well, it's... um...

730
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:23,150
If we were in a union,
we'd make different rates

731
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,110
based on the time we served.

732
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,770
- So, he's been...
...That's not a sliding scale.

733
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,810
- What?
- That's not it.

734
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,550
Well, what's
a sliding scale?

735
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,250
A sliding scale is...

736
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,870
The scale, you know, you start
somewhere and you move up.

737
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,510
Or down.

738
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,310
That's a sliding scale.

739
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:45,350
- He doesn't know.
- You move down?

740
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,070
Dog shit cues.

741
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,670
I swear I could get
a branch outside

742
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,310
straighter than this thing.

743
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,630
Stacy!

744
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,850
Go ahead, break 'em up.

745
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:04,990
Yeah.

746
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,910
I just got chewed out.
You believe that?

747
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,550
What does he want?

748
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,510
I said, "What do you want?"

749
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,750
"You didn't say there were these
Negroes following him, too."

750
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:26,470
- Something's on, man.
- What?

751
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,870
Well, let's say I know more
about Mister Avery

752
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,590
than he thinks I do
about him and his 'operation'.

753
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:36,290
- I got a guy on the inside.
- Who's that?

754
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,950
Know that putz,
Tom, from Seattle?

755
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,990
- Tom... Tom Johanssen?
- Yeah, from Seattle.

756
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:44,910
- I sent him to Avery.
- What he say?

757
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,470
They're taking
a trip up the coast.

758
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,150
Him, Avery, a couple of guys.

759
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:52,370
- We hit this guy again?
- Yeah.

760
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:56,110
If he hasn't gotten whacked,
we might have our aces.

761
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:59,310
I just can't figure out
who this guy is, you know?

762
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:03,070
A courier. A buyer. Seller.

763
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:07,490
Anyway, Avery wants him.

764
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,570
Those jigs wanted him.

765
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,130
You can bet your ass
there's a briefcase somewhere.

766
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,530
A briefcase.

767
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,870
What's in it?

768
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:17,210
Drugs, cash.
Both if we're lucky.

769
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:21,430
While they fuck each other over,
we move right in.

770
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,070
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

771
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,730
Another one?

772
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,650
Yeah. Like, you have
any friends, man?

773
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,550
Yeah.

774
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,130
Could call 'em that, I suppose.

775
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:11,070
Yeah, down the boozer,
Saturday night. Meet the chaps.

776
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:14,490
Friends
and colleagues.

777
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,750
A lot of 'em have gone.

778
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:21,970
The old faces.

779
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:25,010
Dunno where.

780
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,750
Different characters nowadays.

781
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,310
Different assumptions.

782
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,590
You don't know
where you are.

783
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:38,590
The last load
of friends I had...

784
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,070
Well...

785
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,650
it turned out they weren't
my friends after all.

786
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:55,230
Elaine, do you ever understand
half the shit this guy says?

787
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,910
No, but I know
what he means.

788
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:27,010
I should be in Paris
or Kurdistan.

789
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,450
No, he'd find you
in Kurdistan.

790
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:32,830
Why not London? He has a history
of being apprehended there.

791
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,510
You're a font
of optimism.

792
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:38,870
What else have your techies
come up with?

793
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,790
Terry, we're trying
to hunt them down.

794
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:44,630
My soldiers are out there.
What more can I do?

795
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,330
And if he
comes here?

796
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,830
And, what
if he does?

797
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:53,930
Yeah.

798
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,910
So, you don't want
to tell me about this?

799
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:05,650
About being here with
the bodyguards and everything.

800
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:12,110
I don't suppose you've ever had
anything like enemies.

801
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:18,210
Well, I never went out
for the cheerleading squad,

802
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:22,670
and I never stole anyone's
boyfriend that I know of.

803
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:25,550
So no.
I'd like to think not.

804
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,810
You never will.

805
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,670
Well, come on now.

806
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:35,030
I don't want anybody
limiting my possibilities.

807
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,710
That won't happen either.

808
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:42,710
This is...
This is just a precaution.

809
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:49,590
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to drag you along.

810
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:55,790
I... I needed you to,
um, I just don't...

811
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,070
...You don't want
to be alone?

812
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,710
You see? You...

813
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,530
You understand that
about me already.

814
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:24,310
Where is she?

815
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:29,750
Terry... scattered
her ashes from a boat.

816
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:32,670
Buried at a private service.
Private for who? Him?

817
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:39,470
Jenny lived at the beach
when she moved here.

818
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:42,230
She loved the ocean.

819
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,910
She was from an island.

820
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,230
Shit!

821
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,270
George Clooney
comes to Venice

822
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:41,310
as photographers and fans...

823
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:44,070
Are you throwing
the empty shells back in?

824
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:48,230
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

825
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,590
It's amazing here.

826
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:55,150
We went out last night
to this Italian restaurant

827
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:56,930
and they start with...

828
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,250
Check the news.

829
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,130
Check the news.

830
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:03,250
- Where's the remote?
- I dunno.

831
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,310
Fuck.

832
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:25,250
Where the hell is Rick?

833
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:29,210
Hm?

834
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:35,470
Shut off all the inside lights.
I'll get Adhara.

835
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,630
Stay away
from the windows.

836
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:49,750
Hey!

837
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:51,270
You heard of knocking?

838
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,070
Look, come with me.

839
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,030
- Why?
- Please.

840
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,990
- Look, you see that?
- What?

841
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,330
That shadow.

842
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,930
I don't see it.

843
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,430
I told you
to stay away from the windows.

844
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,910
C'mon, everybody. In here.

845
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:26,750
Behind the counter.
Let's go.

846
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,590
Let's go
behind the counter.

847
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:30,130
Terry.

848
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:33,910
What is going on here?

849
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,950
- We think somebody's here.
- What? We think?!

850
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,550
- We can't find Rick and...
- Larry.

851
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,350
- Call the cops.
- No!

852
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,750
- Why not?
- I'm taking care of it.

853
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:46,590
- It's nuts. I'll call the cops.
- No!

854
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,710
Mr Avery...

855
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:04,870
Watch my back.

856
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:35,910
Son of a bitch.

857
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:39,310
Aahhh!

858
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,930
- Pow!
- What is it?

859
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:46,750
I think Avery's down.

860
01:13:58,850 --> 01:13:59,810
Fuck this.

861
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,850
Ah!

862
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:17,430
Ah! Don't!
I'm a friend of Stacy's.

863
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,870
Huh, Fuck you, Tom.

864
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:21,650
Oh! Shit.

865
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:39,070
- Stay.
- What?

866
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,610
Where are you going?

867
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:38,230
Jesus.

868
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:20,610
Tell me.

869
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:28,110
Tell me about Jenny!

870
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:32,870
Tell me about Jenny.

871
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,650
Tell me about Jenny!

872
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:36,630
I needed money.

873
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:39,310
I would have given her
anything she wanted.

874
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:42,730
But she found out
about my deal.

875
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,370
She tried to stop me.

876
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:48,290
Said she was gonna
turn me in.

877
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,890
Said she was gonna
call the cops.

878
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,490
I couldn't stop it.

879
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:55,430
Had already happened.
It was over.

880
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:58,390
She was gonna call the cops.

881
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,270
She meant it.

882
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,910
She had the phone
in her hand.

883
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,310
She was gonna
call the cops.

884
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,330
She meant it.

885
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:09,790
I couldn't stop it.

886
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:14,150
I couldn't do anything.

887
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:45,070
Ta.

888
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:48,890
You're English.

889
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:51,130
Yeah, that's right.

890
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,330
I can never decide
what I like better.

891
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:57,610
Leaving home
or coming back.

892
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:03,950
I prefer
staying 'ome, me.

893
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:08,010
Oh, so you're
a reluctant traveller?

894
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:14,010
Got called out
to LA unexpected-like.

895
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:17,070
Do a job of work.

896
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:19,870
No rest for the wicked.

897
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:22,990
Been away a lot.

898
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,030
Where else?

899
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:37,730
Out on a an oil rig
in the North Sea.

900
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:40,750
Nine years.

901
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:44,110
Nine years?
Wow, is that legal?

902
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:48,510
Well, time off
for good behaviour.

903
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,390
I shouldn't
have even been there.

904
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,470
It was these other lads

905
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:57,630
what should have been
in my place.

906
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:01,150
And then just when
I finish me nine years...

907
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,990
me contract, wallop.

908
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:09,510
I had to bugger off
to the States.

909
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:13,130
Well, it sounds like
you need a rest.

910
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:19,990
Yeah, could be.

911
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:49,830
That was very good.

912
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:51,390
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

913
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:54,230
- Gettin' better, ain't I?
- You are.

914
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:57,150
Huh.
