Bobby, you want to sprinkle
the infield with The General?

25
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,157
This is fucking awesome.
We spend $80 million...

26
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,491
to drag a bunch of
Jersey geriatrics

wet-shit their Depends.

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,861
The old guard.

29
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,596
They're not that old.

30
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,537
You see Stackhouse
block LeBron with his walker?

00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,439
Gentlemen, these
are on the house.

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,282
When he speaks,
he says nice things.

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,042
Rardy, can you clean that up?

34
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,948
Okay, if it's for Richie.

35
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,883
You got new pants, Sully?

36
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,785
Yeah, I'll send them
to the dry cleaners.

37
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,168
- Rardy, we're not thanking you.
- Fuck you.

Cousin Marv, thanks
for the drink.

00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,058
Thanks, Marv.

00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,233
Shall we say
something for the kid?

42
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,235
Sully, go ahead. Yeah,
Sully, do it up.

43
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,308

Let me guess.

50
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,426
You bought them the round.

51
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,695
Yeah. They're only...

52
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:47,428
They're celebrating the anniversary
of a very close friend, Marv.

53
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,597
The kid's been dead, what...
10 years now?

54
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,732
<i>Mmm.</i>

55
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,574
Ought to be a point
where you move on.

56
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,705
Stop scoring free
drinks off a corpse.

57
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,909
Speaking of which,
stop letting her ride

58
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,007
a stool all night and
not pay for her drinks.

59
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,276
Who, Millie? Yeah, Millie.

60
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,779
She doesn't drink that much.

61
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,022
When's the last time
you charged her?

62
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,124
It's
Millie, you know.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,727
After midnight, you let her smoke
in here even though it's illegal.

64
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,133
You think I didn't know that?

65
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,734
If she can't pay
her tab tonight,

66
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,899
she don't come back in
here till she does.

67
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,804
Her bar tab is, like, 120 bucks.

68
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,636
It's about $140.

69
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,471
But she can't afford
it, you know?

70
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah, I'm gonna start crying now.
Okay?

71
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,646
And get all the candy canes
and Christmas shit down.

72
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,586
It's December 27th. Come on.

73
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:42,983
Gentlemen.

74
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,795
Why don't you go
fuck yourselves?

75
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,181
<i>hallowed be Thy name.</i>

76
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,494
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

77
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,028
on earth as it is in heaven.

78
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,353
Give us this day
our daily bread.

79
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,534
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

80
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,136
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

81
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,365
Peace be with you.

82
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,203
Peace be with you.

83
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,880
Peace be with you.

84
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,640

85
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,215

00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,719
The Body of Christ.

87
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,725
The Body of Christ.

88
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,841
Oh. Oh.

89
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,614
Oh. That's not good.

90
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,909
What are
you doing in there?

91
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,782
All right. All right, now.

92
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,589
Aw.

93
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,621
Hey. What are
you doing in my trash?

94
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,798
You have a dog in
your trash can.

95
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,126
It's a boxer.

96
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,699
Oh.

97
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,473
Jesus.

98
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,809
You have a dog here
in your trash.

99
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,476
Ooh.

100
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,310
Ooh.

101
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,546
Oh.

102
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,822
This one's bleeding.

103
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,120
What's your name?

104
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,320
Bob Saginowski.

105
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,655
Let me see your license.

106
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:36,092
My license? My wallet
is in my pocket

107
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,999
You'll have to take it out.

108
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,344
I just sent that picture to four people.
We clear?

109
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,286
Oh, he's freezing.

110
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,754
Yeah, well, it's cold.

111
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,854
Let's bring him inside.

112
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,529
I'm Nadia' by the way.

113
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,436
Is it bad?

114
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,432
It's not that deep, but, man.

115
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:20,041
Someone beat the shit out of this dog.
See these knots?

116
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,940
That's not skull,
that's contusions.

117
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,713
Are you a vet?

118
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,546
No, I'm a waitress at
the Ashmont Grill.

119
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,889
But I worked at Animal
Rescue one summer as a tech.

120
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,555
Careful.

121
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,524
They're so hard, this breed.

122
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,220
To find them a home.

123
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,228
Boxers?

124
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,558
This isn't a boxer.
It's a pit bull.

125
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,067
That's a dangerous dog.

126
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,234
It's not the dog's fault
his owner is a dick.

127
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,240
This guy...

128
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,238
look at him.

129
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,575
He's nothing but sweet.

130
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,986
You'll need a crate... makes them
feel safe. I have one you can borrow.

131
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,989
And food and chew
toys and stuff.

132
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,256
But I was, I was just passing
a garbage can. I can't...

133
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,090
I'll just take him back.

134
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,931
To who? The guy who beat him?

135
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,161
I'll take him to the
proper authorities.

136
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,101
That would be the shelter.

137
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,330
Right.

138
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,241
After they give the owner
seven days to reclaim him,

139
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,108
if he decides not to...

140
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,337
this dog will be put
up for adoption.

141
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,177
But who knows what kind
of person will take him?

142
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,616
I don't know.

143
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,452
You can take him. You take him.

144
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,957
I work nights. I work a lot.

145
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,193
We'll have to send him
to Animal Rescue.

146
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,956
Okay, look, can you, can you...

147
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,965
give me a couple days to
think about it? Please?

148
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,205
I have to think about this.
It's a big responsibility.

149
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,968
I don't know anything about...

150
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,871
Please, just a couple days.
I'll come back.

151
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,137
Please, a couple days.
Hold him till the weekend.

152
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,441
Just the weekend. It's a couple days.
Please. Please.

153
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,546
Saturday morning.

154
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,152
Thank you.

155
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,160
All right. Thank you.

156
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,229
Saturday.

157
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,826
Bob?

158
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,091
The dog needs a name.
Mmm, right.

159
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,834
Oh, my God.

160
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,676
You're going to be okay.

161
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,342
Do you know a Nadia Dunn?
Nadia Dunn?

162
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,352
You don't?

163
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,446
You don't?

164
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,680
No.

165
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,484
That's the girl who's
holding the dog.

166
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,029
The dog again.

167
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,699
You know, I was thinking
that training a dog...

168
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,197
housebreaking, and
all that, that's...

169
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,865
l mean, that is a huge
responsibility, right?

170
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,367
Well, it's a dog.

171
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,015
It's not like some
long-lost retarded

172
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,811
relative shows up
in a wheelchair...

173
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,383
a colostomy bag hanging
out of his ass.

174
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,879
Says, "I'm yours now.
Take care of me."

175
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,055
It's not that.

176
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,724
It's a dog.

177
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,401
Yeah.

178
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,377
What?

179
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,877
What?

180
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,310
No.

181
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,546
It's a fucking bad idea.

182
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,657
We should hit it for
everything or not at all.

183
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,385
Little brother, listen.

184
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,327
My guy says we got
to show him...

185
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,089
that we can handle our shit.

186
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,567
Says we do it in steps. See
how the owners respond.

187
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,669
They could respond pretty
fucking bad, you nut.

188
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,331
So that's what we'll see.

189
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:18,009
Your guy. Your fucking guy
talks a whole hell of a lot.

190
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,276
It's a fucking drop bar.

191
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,180
Not tonight it isn't.

192
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,185
Okay?

193
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,188
<i>Okay.</i>

194
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,481
Don't think about
it, just fill it.

195
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,889
Okay, we won't
cause any trouble.

196
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,653
You're making trouble!

197
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,293
Do you know what the
fuck you're doing?

198
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,560
Marv.

199
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,232
Do you know whose money this is?

200
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,902
Fucking fill the bag!

201
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,899
All right.

202
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,739
Just take it easy.

203
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,413
There you go.

204
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,182
Go ahead.

205
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,420
You fucking talk too much.

206
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,161
Oh.

207
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,037
Where's Rardy?

208
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,276
Rardy?

209
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,943
What the fuck?

210
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,647
You all right?

211
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,716
Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

212
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,780
I'm okay.

213
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,013
Look at his head.

214
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,279
Split open. We got to
call an ambulance.

215
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,891
That's bad. Rardy, don't move.
Just stay where you are.

216
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,219
How bad do I look?

217
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,661
Don't move. It's not good.

218
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,325
I'm putting something
on your head.

219
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,836
Hold that

220
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,169
There's one for your face.

221
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,011
The 8 o'clock at St. Dom's.

222
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,515
Every morning we see each
other and we've never met.

223
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,051
Detective Evandro Torres.

224
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,023
Hi. I'm Bob Saginowski.

225
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,722
A shame about St. Dom's.

226
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,921
What do you mean?

227
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,530
I just found out they're
folding it into St. Mary's.

228
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,693
Can you believe that?

229
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,091
I did not know that.

230
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,860
You're the bartender? Yeah.

231
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,369
The guys with the guns...
Want to take a walk?

232
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,543
They sound like anyone who
ever came in here before?

233
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,006
Nah. The guy closest to me,

234
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,106
I could see that his
watch had stopped.

235
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:09,581
Officer Bernardo says you said
they were covered head to toe'?

236
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,881
<i>Handles, masks'?</i>

237
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,785
Yeah, but I could see his
wrist as it was turning.

238
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,392
The face of the watch was
in front of me, like that.

239
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:19,890
And it was stopped?

240
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,056
Yeah. It said 6:15.

241
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,294
How much they take you for?

242
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,729
Well, whatever was
in the register.

243
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,433
So, if I was to ask around,

244
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,302
I wouldn't hear
anything about...

245
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:33,408
anyone making book here, or
someone moving money around?

246
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,805
Excuse me?

247
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,740
I wouldn't hear that? Nah.

248
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,778
Do you have insurance, Rardy?

249
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,145
What do you think?

250
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,408
No, we don't
have insurance.

251
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,135
The whole thing's a travesty.

252
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,985
Yeah, he took a pretty bad hit.

253
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,247
Nah, I meant St. Dom's.

254
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,582
Yeah. Yeah.

255
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,490
Beautiful church.
They did <i>Mass</i> right.

256
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:56,928
No group hugs after the Our Father.
No folk singers.

257
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,997
By the time the seculars get
done persecuting the Church...

258
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,002
all we'll have left is a bunch of
condos with stained glass windows.

259
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,108
What's up with the
surveillance cameras in there?

260
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,505
They don't record.

261
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,103
They're just a
deterrent for crime.

262
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,940
Why don't you take Communion?

263
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,449
Excuse me?

264
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,277
I've seen you at Mass for years.

265
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,788
You haven't taken
Communion once.

266
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,622
Well, you know,
that's my business.

267
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,629
You think so, huh?

268
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,626
Yeah, I think so.

269
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,965
Jesus. I fucking know so.

270
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,939
So was he gonna let you
wear his letter jacket...

271
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,813
or did he have to twist your
nipples a few times first?

272
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:51,219
Why the fuck would you tell
that cop about the watch?

273
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,512
I don't know.

274
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,647
You don't know.

275
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,881
It just came out.

276
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,822
Well, next time, why don't you nip
that impulse in the bud, huh'?

277
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,724
What the fuck is wrong with you?

278
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,058
It was very unlike me, Marv.

279
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,327
They took us for five
thou and some change.

280
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,003
Five thousand?

281
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,501
Thank God they picked
up the envelope,

282
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,238
so we're not on the
hook for that.

283
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,844
So we're all right. We're okay.

284
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,508
No, they took us for five
large and some change.

285
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,347
It's their bar,
it's their money.

286
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,714
They're going to want it back.

287
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,689
So we're not so fucking okay.

288
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,423
Bob?

289
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,596
You all right? Yeah.

290
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,064
Kind of early for the eight.

291
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,368
Yeah. I figured I could wait.

292
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,869
Well, come on in.

293
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,399
It's just a bowl and some food.

294
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,078
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

295
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,471
Good luck.

296
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,570
Thank you.

297
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:01,278
You know, I've never
owned a dog before...

298
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,450
so' you know...

299
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:08,456
I have no idea what I'm doing.
At all.

300
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,459
You'll need bowls.

301
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,129
A leash.

302
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,126
Uh, poop bags.

303
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:27,138
And from now on, keep
your <i>shoes</i> up on a shelf.

304
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,804
Let me see if I can
find the bed section.

305
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,311
Oh. What do you want?

306
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:43,154
This is the best book I know.
You should read it.

307
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,388
Everything is in here.

308
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,739
What are you naming him?

309
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:03,344
Well, I was thinking about maybe Rocco.
I like the name Rocco.

310
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,412
But then I thought Mike.

311
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,515
Mike?

312
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,080
You don't like Mike?

313
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:12,349
No. Mike is not a
great name for a dog.

314
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,514
Rocco is better.

315
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,353
<i>Okay -</i>

316
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,520
So did they name you
Nadia after the gymnast?

317
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,755
Yeah. So you're a gymnast?

318
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,194
No.

319
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,869
Oh. Here you go. See?

320
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:32,199
"Rocco". Hey, he likes it.

321
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,033
Yeah, I like Mike.

322
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,216
You have him? Yeah.

323
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,715
Be patient.

324
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,047
Bye, thank you.

325
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,745
"Make sure the bottoms of the two
side panels rest inside the bottom."

326
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,590
Hey, Rocco?

327
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,759
I made you a safe place.

328
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,283
Bob?

329
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,284
Cold one, huh?

330
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:03,199
Who needs snow blower
when you have Bob?

331
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,962
Maybe you come to
my house later.

332
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,130
Sure.

333
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,132
I'm kidding.

334
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,701
This guy.

335
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,802
You on the welfare?

336
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,205
Excuse me?

337
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,708
Bob does all the work.
You watch.

338
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,643
No, I was shoveling.

339
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,874
You're shoveling, all right.
He was.

340
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,813
Come.

341
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,842
You know this guy?

342
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,170
No.

343
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,076
But I know this guy.

344
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,584
Moment I know him, I know him.

345
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,348
Somebody robbed my bar.

346
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,523
Yes. That's right. I'm sorry, Mr.
Umarov.

347
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,532
Call my father Mr.
Umarov.

348
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,756
Bob...

349
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,030
call me Chovka, eh?

350
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,264
That's right, I'm sorry, Mr.
Chovka, somebody did rob your bar.

351
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,031
Who robbed our bar?

352
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,606
We don't know. They wore masks.

353
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,869
That's right. So
we couldn't see.

354
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,016
Police report says one
wore a broken watch.

355
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,107
You tell them this?

356
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:33,122
Yeah, I did. I wasn't thinking.
It just came out.

357
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,952
So what are you doing to get
my father's money back?

358
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,889
Well, we put the word out.

359
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,064
In the neighborhood.
That's right.

360
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,231
They got the word
out in the neighborhood.

361
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,459
So the word is out there, huh?

362
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,399
The word. That's right.

363
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,635
With my money.

364
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,576
Find my fucking money.

365
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,824
"Find my money."

366
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,929
If we knew where
their money was,

367
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,935
it would mean we
knew who robbed us.

368
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,396
Which would mean
we were in on it,

369
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,666
which means they'd
shoot us in the face.

370
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,263
Fucking Chechnyans.

371
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,266
Chechens, Marv.

372
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,773
They're from Chechnya, but
you call them Chechens.

373
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,349
Yeah, Chechnya.

374
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,814
I said that. You
don't call people

375
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,618
from Ireland
Irelandians, do you?

376
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,951
What the fuck are
you talking about?

377
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,530
Yo, yo. What's the sunset
nightcap this evening?

378
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,100
You bring your own cup?

379
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,299
What, I just got
out of the womb?

380
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,307
Salud.

381
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:04,970
So what up, Evandro?

382
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,047
You remember Marvin Stipler?

383
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:08,512
Cousin Marv?

384
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,052
He got pushed off his own book,

385
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,582
nine, ten years ago,
by the Chechens.

386
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,847
His bar got held up.

387
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,449
It's owned by one of Papa
Umarov's shell companies.

388
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,988
What kind of dumb-ass
holds up one of his bars?

389
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,155
You got me.

390
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,561
Major Crimes up on the Umarovs?

391
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,893
We barely survived the
last budget cuts.

392
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,838
We're not sticking our
heads up to go after

393
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,499
some Russian John Q
barely knows exists.

394
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:31,730
Chechen.

395
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,837
You want him, he's all yours.

396
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:48,253
Hey, baby brother, you
ready to eat'? Huh?

397
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,383
What?

398
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,756
Are you ready to eat?

399
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:53,690
No.

400
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,193
I ate already.

401
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,360
When did you eat?

402
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:00,701
I ate.

403
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,880
Oh, no. Hey, hey, no.

404
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,375
Rocco, stay there. Stay.

405
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,385
Don't do it.

406
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,551
Don't do it. Don’t jump.

407
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,719
Oh, crikey Jesus.

408
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,889
That was close.

409
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,900
Aw, you gave me a heart attack.

410
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,872
Where the fuck you been?

411
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:45,972
Getting here.

412
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,416
You got the money? No.

413
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,112
What do you mean, no?

414
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,088
I mean no 'cause
fucking Bri has it.

415
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,485
Bri has it.

416
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,555
Did you tell your
brother about me?

417
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,754
No.

418
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,759
Why the fuck you
hit Rardy so hard?

419
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,659
I had to. You had to.

420
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,332
And I had to call an ambulance.

421
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,164
So there's an
ambulance and cops.

422
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:07,766
What's with his watch?

423
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,301
People noticed it's broke.

424
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,500
Tell him to get a new one
and get rid of that one.

425
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,103
Today.

426
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:20,840
What's the next step? When
do we hit a real drop bar?

427
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,610
Let's just assume I'm not some
asshole without a plan, okay?

428
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,763
When an airplane goes down, what's the
safest airline to fly the next day?

429
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,953
The one that had the crash.

430
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,625
Right. There you go.

431
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,022
So we just wait.

432
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,198
I don't understand a fucking
word you're saying.

433
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,688
It's like you're
speaking Brazilian.

434
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,958
Just let me take
care of it, okay?

435
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,028
Keep your head down.

436
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,104
It's not Brazilian.
Brazilians speak Portuguese.

437
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,165
Where you going?

438
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,471
I'm leaving.

439
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,706
Stay here. We can't be
seen together, genius.

440
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,140
Fuck you. How long?

441
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,149
I don't know. Ten minutes!

442
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:54,640
Sit.

443
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,484
Sit. No, that's standing.
Come here.

444
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,652
Go, go. Oh, man.

445
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:08,987
How you doing?

446
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,222
Good.

447
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,663
Oh, shit. Rocco, come on!

448
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,335
Come. Good boy.

449
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,165
You didn't read the
book, did you?

450
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:20,843
Uh, some of it, yeah.
No.

451
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,338
Not a lot.

452
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:25,342
I was thinking-mow
the holidays over...

453
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,074
l lost a shift at
the restaurant.

454
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,683
I'm sorry.

455
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,854
So maybe you could
hire me, you know?

456
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,858
Pay me to babysit Rocco
when you're working?

457
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,863
Hey, well, that's not
such a bad idea.

458
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,361
I work a lot at the bar.

459
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,935
That would be very kind of you.

460
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,200
You have a number I can call'?

461
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:54,542
Maybe call. You want to
arrange this properly?

462
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,106
Just put it there.

463
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,212
Have you got a pen? No.

464
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,115
I think I have a pen.

465
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,220
Where's that pen
when you need it?

466
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:11,952
Does it work?

467
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,119
Yeah.

468
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,058
Here you go.

469
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,736
Great. That's a great idea.

470
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,404
And I need a key.

471
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,079
Well, like' maybe I could... if you
call me, I'll either have it...

472
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,405
and drop it around yours, or I
could leave it at the bar for you.

473
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,739
Call me.

474
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,383
Yeah, I'll call you... on this
number you gave me right now.

475
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,115
Happy New Year, by the way!

476
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,588
Happy New Year!

477
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,588
We should
join that show.

478
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,770
You can't fucking sing.

479
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:58,271
Not that one, the other
one, where the people...

480
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:02,104
go around the world picking
up clues and stuff.

481
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,778
It'd be cool. Let's do it.

482
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:07,948
We could see things.

483
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,777
What things?

484
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,113
I don't know. Other countries.

485
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,948
Other ways.

486
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,460
You see the old man today?

487
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,452
<i>Yeah, was by.</i>

488
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,291
They want
their money, Marv.

489
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,297
Who?

490
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,137
The home.

491
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,702
They'll get it.

492
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,467
It's the collection
agency now, not the home.

493
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:39,476
Medicaid cutbacks. Me retiring.

494
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,644
They're going to ship him out.

495
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,219
To where?

496
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:47,650
To a lesser place.

497
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,323
Maybe it's time.

498
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:55,825
Yeah.

499
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,501
Just kill him.

500
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,407
Our father. Because
it's inconvenient.

501
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,666
He's dead, Marv.

502
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,841
So what are all those beeps
coming out of the machines...

503
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,350
he's hooked up to, and the waves

504
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,908
on the screen of the thing?

505
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:16,850
That's life.

506
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,347
That's electricity,
is what that is.

507
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:32,032
The other day, I picked up his
hand and put it on my cheek.

508
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,035
And I could hear his blood.

509
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:43,210
So you want to unplug him?
Go ahead, your decision.

510
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,878
Take it easy.

511
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,582
No, make the decision.
I'll be all right with it.

512
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,911
Mmm-hmm.

513
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,116
That's! be a first.

514
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,219
Never mind. It's okay.

515
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,124
I'll get to Europe
in another life.

516
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:03,864
Rocco. Come to heel.

517
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,692
Come to heel. Come to heel.
And sit.

518
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,361
You see that?
Yeah, I saw it.

519
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,799
He almost gave me the paw.

520
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,705
When I watch TV, he
sleeps on my leg.

521
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,536
Really? Out.

522
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,041
Come.

523
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,208
I'll be right back.

524
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,709
Crazy. Come on.

525
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,158
That's a nice dog.

526
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,235
Thank you. I appreciate it.

527
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,572
Yeah, that's a nice-looking dog.

528
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,912
Don't forget to feed it.

529
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,598
Tell me where the hospital is?

530
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,595
Bang a U-ey, go down
to the end here.

531
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,431
Take a right. There'll be signs.

532
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,373
Thanks.

533
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:44,795
I promise, tomorrow we'll go to the park.
But I'm in a mad rush today.

534
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,459
I will be back very soon.

535
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,083
Hey, man, how you doing?

536
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,921
Mind if I step in? It's
kind of cold outside.

537
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,029
Thanks a lot.

538
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,869
Jesus.

539
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,208
Can I help you?

540
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,781
Yeah. Where are you keeping him?

541
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,946
What are you talking about?

542
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:41,713
The dog. You keep him in the kitchen?
The cellar?

543
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,020
I remember you.

544
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,553
You came up to me in the park and
told me I had a nice-looking dog.

545
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,398
Yeah, well, he's not your dog.

546
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,392
Yeah, he's my dog.

547
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,628
Oh, yeah'? You register him?

548
00:34:56,895 --> 00:35:00,741
City says you have to license it.
How about a chip?

549
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,241
Excuse me? A security chip.

550
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,448
Implanted in the dog.
Pooch goes missing,

551
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,483
shows up at a vet.
Vet scans the dog.

552
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,083
Up pops a barcode with
the owner's info.

553
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:14,085
The owner, meanwhile, walks
around with a slip of paper.

554
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,325
It has the security chip
account number on it.

555
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,587
Check it out.

556
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,925
You got my dog.

557
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,769
No, it's my dog.

558
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,839
You beat him.

559
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,607
I'll tell the cops you did.

560
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,280
What do you want?

561
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,119
It's kind of sunny, right?

562
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,291
Hmm.

563
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,127
But you never know, I guess.

564
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,837
You never ask about it.

565
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,075
You're the only
person I ever met

566
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,010
who didn't ask about it in
the first five minutes.

567
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,212
It's your business, not mine.

568
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:51,010
You'll tell me when you
tell me, or you won't.

569
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,018
I did it to myself.
I was pretty high.

570
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,924
You did that?

571
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,524
With one of those...

572
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,196
like, a peeler.

573
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,522
Peeler?

574
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,934
You know, a potato peeler?

575
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:10,036
Oh, God, yeah, I know
what that is, right.

576
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:18,204
I was a different person then.
I didn't really like myself.

577
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,714
Do you like yourself now?

578
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,949
Sir, you cannot
have a dog in here.

579
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,046
Dog goes, YOU guys go, okay?

580
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,895
I'm telling you...

581
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,399
l got guys following me.

582
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,565
You don't.

583
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,072
I do. I told you about
the guy in the car.

584
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,642
He was asking you
for directions.

585
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,205
It was the way he asked. The
way he was looking at me.

586
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,751
I'm not a fucking idiot.

587
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,589
What about you? The guy
with the umbrella.

588
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,651
Oh, he's just
interested in the dog.

589
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,327
The dog. Mmm.

590
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:11,264
How do you know? Maybe he's
just telling you that.

591
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,597
It's too
much for them to...

592
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,937
put them back where
they found them,

593
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,000
because that would
require courtesy.

594
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,777
You should just get
a dumpster, Marv.

595
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,607
"Just get a dumpster, Marv.
Get a dumpster."

596
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,112
Sure.

597
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,449
You remember I don't own
the bar anymore, right?

598
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,681
Huh?

599
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:35,951
Yeah.

600
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,960
Oh, yeah, but it's not
your bar Chovka took.

601
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,527
That was 10 years ago.

602
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,958
No, it was eight-and-a-half
years ago.

603
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,134
All right.

604
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,458
Eight-and-a-half years.

605
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,143
Dottie thinks we
should visit Europe.

606
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:09,049
That's what I've become... a guy
that goes to Europe with his sister.

607
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,321
Hops in a, a tour bus...

608
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,821
with a fucking camera around my
neck like a fucking jerk off.

609
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,063
What?

610
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,069
Uh...

611
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,008
You need to see this, Marv.

612
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,507
No, I don't.

613
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,176
I don't need to do anything.

614
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,552
I'm just going to
stand right here.

615
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,852
I'm going to stand
right the fuck here.

616
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,352
No.

617
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,359
You really should
take a look at this.

618
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,860
I don't need to see Europe.
I don't need to see Dottie.

619
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:53,529
And I don't need to see
what's in that bag.

620
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,217
Aw, what the fuck?

621
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,050
We need to do something with it.

622
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,229
What, the money or the...

623
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,587
thing?

624
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,631
I bet what's in here adds up
to what we lost that night.

625
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,563
Why'd they give it back to us?

626
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,065
So we give it back to them.

627
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,901
That's clearly what they expect.

628
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,429
Like you're wrapping
a piece of meat.

629
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,997
Like you've done it
a thousand times.

630
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,780
Do you wonder if you hadn't
mentioned the watch...

631
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,006
No, I don't.

632
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,684
Well, I do.

633
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,449
Hi, guys. You got any Zima?

634
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,788
No, we're closed.

635
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,787
Well, your door was
unlocked, so...

636
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,690
I'm sorry about that, but
we're closed now, so...

637
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,129
Yeah. Yeah.

638
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:31,356
You got to go.

639
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,862
Hey, Bob.

640
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,798
How you doing? Nice to see you.

641
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,471
All right, come on.

642
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,311
Say hi to Nadia.

643
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:49,484
Don't forget to stitch her up
when she stabs herself, okay?

644
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:01,824
Tossing the missing piece of the
One-Armed Man around like a ham...

645
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,896
and the front door's open!

646
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,833
He didn't see anything.

647
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,165
But he could've.

648
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:09,836
But he didn't

649
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:12,998
You know that guy?

650
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,240
Yeah. That's the guy I
told you about with Rocco.

651
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,345
Who claims the dog is his?

652
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,811
You know who else he is?

653
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:24,876
No.

654
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,096
He's the guy who says
he killed Richie Whelan.

655
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:36,195
That guy? Yeah.

656
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,667
That's Eric Deeds?

657
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,202
Yeah, that's Eric Deeds.

658
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,765
And he's fucked in the
squash, that guy.

659
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:47,004
Been in the joint
a couple times.

660
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,773
He did a 30-day in the
cuckoo house, if I recall.

661
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,412
So you watch that fucking kid.

662
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,209
Some fucking day, Marv.

663
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,049
Yeah, some fucking day.

664
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:04,621
Will you pass me the sports bag

665
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,719
by the wasp-and-ants spray?

666
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,724
Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

667
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,126
Thank you.

668
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,737
I'm going for a walk now.

669
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:29,578
<i>Okay.</i>

670
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,586
Fucking Christ.

671
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,020
Don't look at that.
Don't look at it.

672
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,122
Hey, hey, what's this?

673
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,021
Go get it. Go on.

674
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:16,959
Yeah, play with it.
My big red bone.

675
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:19,624
Go get it. Go get that!

676
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,459
Get the bone!

677
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:45,552
Aw, shit.

678
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,052
Mr. Saginowski.

679
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,532
How you doing?

680
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm good.

681
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,005
We haven't caught them yet.

682
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,837
Yeah, well, you
know, I assumed...

683
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,010
That we didn't do our job?

684
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:09,909
No, I just heard it was hard to
make an arrest on robbery cases.

685
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,181
What's up with the bag?

686
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:14,689
This is...

687
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:18,687
It's my poop bag and sometimes
I keep leashes and balls...

688
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,520
and stuff in my bag.

689
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,094
Kind of empty.

690
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,196
Yeah, well, I used my last
poop bag and I lost the ball.

691
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:31,037
Richie Whelan.

692
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,263
Uh-huh.

693
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,206
What about him? You know him?

694
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:38,380
Sure. His friends were in the bar the
other day, toasting his anniversary.

695
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,212
What anniversary?

696
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,440
Of the last time
anybody saw him.

697
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:43,777
Which was at your bar.

698
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,214
That's right. Yeah, he left.

699
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,047
He took his car and they
found it someplace.

700
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,382
Astoria. Torched.

701
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:53,359
That's a good-looking dog.

702
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:54,894
Oh, thank you.

703
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,563
You know an Eric Deeds?

704
00:45:57,722 --> 00:45:58,792
Uh...

705
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:02,234
Tall guy? Beard? He's,
like, a broader'?

706
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,299
Um, maybe.

707
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,236
I mean, you working in that bar.
Come on.

708
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,409
You know people, Mr. Saginowski.

709
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,908
I got a picture.

710
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,257
Nah. You think maybe
he robbed the bar?

711
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:24,582
No.

712
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,594
I'm hearing here and
there that this guy...

713
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:31,259
has something to do with
the Whelan disappearance.

714
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,266
Really?

715
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:38,100
That's a really
good-looking dog.

716
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,621
I came by to give
him his afternoon walk.

717
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:03,854
Great.

718
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:06,294
I freaked. Is your cell on?

719
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:10,299
Yeah, but it's on vibrate.
I couldn't feel it.

720
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:11,973
I called a bunch of times.

721
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,369
I know, I could see that.
I'm sorry.

722
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:15,975
I thought you were
working today.

723
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,138
I am. It's just I had this...

724
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:21,473
You know what? It's a
really long story.

725
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:24,650
I'm sorry. I should have called you.
I apologize.

726
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,648
It's okay. Hey.

727
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,317
So you know Eric Deeds, huh?

728
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,822
No. l don’t "know
him“ know him...

729
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,155
you know? I know
him from around.

730
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,490
So you don't know him?

731
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,826
Not really, no.

732
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:46,498
That's funny, because the way
he said it, I figured...

733
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,407
Figured what?

734
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,172
I don't know. You know, maybe...

735
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:52,806
I don't know.

736
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,178
Why are you on my ass about it?

737
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,912
I was just asking a question.

738
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,744
No' you were insinuating.

739
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,754
No, I wasn't.

740
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,020
Now you're arguing
just to argue with me.

741
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,917
No.

742
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,185
See? I'm not.

743
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,759
I don't need this shit, okay?

744
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:15,693
Wait. What happened here?
Did I say something wrong?

745
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,199
You think you can
push me around?

746
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,600
No. Wait.

747
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:23,868
Don't you fucking touch me.

748
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,726
I don't understand.

749
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,398
I asked her one question.

750
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:59,070
A question. Simple. And then
it all came out sideways.

751
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,912
You don't get it.
They get in a mood...

752
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,212
you could give them
the Hope Diamond

753
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,314
and they'd complain
about the weight.

754
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:09,751
Am I right?

755
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,824
Bob, you ain't actually talking
about a girl, are you?

756
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,756
Bobby's got himself a girl?

757
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,264
Guy gets a dog, becomes
a pussy magnet.

758
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:20,762
They're flinging
it at my man now.

759
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,335
I'm gonna go play some pool.

760
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:34,276
How are you?

761
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,279
Chovka, let me
get you a drink.

762
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:44,453
Marv'? Stella-Andre,
he drinks Stella.

763
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:45,954
Oh.

764
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:59,305
There you go.

765
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,178
Here it is.

766
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:12,318
I put it in a Ziploc. But it's all there.
You can count it.

767
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:14,714
Ziploc?

768
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:16,981
Well, it was a little wet.

769
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:21,160
I was going to dry it, but
we don't have a dryer.

770
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,398
So I figured I'd put it in a Ziploc.
If you spread it out...

771
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:28,000
on a table, it should be
good come the morning.

772
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,562
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Bob.

773
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:33,737
This isn't what you
gave me last time.

774
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,342
That? No, that's not
the Bowmore 18.

775
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,671
You didn't like it. You
said it smelled like feet.

776
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:43,247
I figured that you would
prefer this a lot more.

777
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,013
This is very special.

778
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:53,359
It's Irish.

779
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,597
We die.

780
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,031
All of us...

781
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,432
Andre.

782
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:12,708
But before you do, you have to
try this fucking whiskey, man.

783
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:16,448
Yeah, get him one.
Come on. Here.

784
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:24,222
You handle the drop.

785
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:27,059
All right. Which night?

786
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,220
Super Bowl.

787
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,569
<i>Okay -</i>

788
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,072
ls good.

789
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,816
Detective
Evandro Torres.

790
00:51:58,649 --> 00:51:59,719
Jimmy Sullivan.

791
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:00,918
Thanks for seeing me.

792
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,428
So you got nothing else about
the night Glory Days vanished?

793
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:08,501
The only thing I remember was that
he left the bar to score weed.

794
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,933
And the guys he got it from
were a couple of shitheads.

795
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:16,938
A nut job named Deeds and his
junkie buddy... what was his name?

796
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,340
Tim Brennan. He was in
the original statement.

797
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:20,608
<i>Theta me guy.</i>

798
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:24,950
He was going to see them both'?
Or only one?

799
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,115
I don't remember.

800
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:33,125
But Bob Saginowski
and Cousin Marv?

801
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:35,188
You trying to tie them to this?

802
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,286
Nah, I just-

803
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,500
You got me out here in front
of the guys l work with,

804
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,034
looking like a snitch.

805
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,793
Thanks for that. But
Cousin Marv's place?

806
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:46,802
That's my bar. All right?
Don't fuck with my bar.

807
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:09,787
You know, I'm...

808
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,531
I'm sorry.

809
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,792
I don't care
if you know him.

810
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,197
It's just that...

811
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,899
the way that he
said hi, you know,

812
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:21,033
it sounded like it
meant something.

813
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,808
I was just asking.

814
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:28,480
What else did he say?

815
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,650
He said that Rocco was his.

816
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,649
That he has a chip in
his neck to prove it.

817
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,676
He used to be my boyfriend.

818
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,851
In the beginning,
he was charming.

819
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:12,187
He was really nice.

820
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,457
I know a lot of people said things
about him, but I don’t judge people.

821
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,861
I don't want to prejudge people.

822
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,296
Sure.

823
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,693
It just became too much.

824
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:26,371
I haven't seen him in a while.
I thought he was gone.

825
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,059
I'm sorry.

826
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,393
I'm so sorry.

827
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,159
I'm sorry.

828
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:54,736
You don't have to explain.

829
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,994
Everybody has a past.

830
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:02,237
And if this guy put Rocco in your
trash, that's not your fault.

831
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:06,412
And as for Rocco, he won't blame you.
You know?

832
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:09,581
He don't know no better.

833
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,101
He's not just going to go away.

834
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,598
Eric? No.

835
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,933
He doesn't strike me as the
type that wants to do that.

836
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,766
He's not.

837
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,772
He killed a kid
named Glory Days.

838
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,449
Yeah. I heard that

839
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,453
I heard that.

840
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:53,721
Richie Whelan.

841
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,625
Hmm.

842
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:57,558
Why?

843
00:55:57,955 --> 00:55:59,457
I don't know.

844
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:04,299
He's not a big fan of "why".
Eric.

845
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,171
Hmm.

846
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,301
It's broken.

847
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,478
Yeah, it is.

848
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,182
Do you want me to fix it?

849
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:20,211
You want to fix it?

850
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,345
Yeah.

851
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:23,518
Sure.

852
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,189
You want another beer?

853
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:27,688
Yeah.

854
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:44,710
Sol heard that Cousin
Marv doesn't own the bar?

855
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:46,878
That some hard guys do.

856
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:49,550
But you're not a hard guy.

857
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:52,380
So why do you work there?

858
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,450
You know me and Cousin
Marv go way back, right?

859
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:58,454
Yeah, Marv is
actually my cousin.

860
00:56:58,715 --> 00:56:59,716
Yeah?

861
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,553
Marv and his sister, Dottie...

862
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:06,732
his father and my mother,
they're all sisters.

863
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:08,061
Really?

864
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,128
Did they share makeup?

865
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:11,702
Why would they do that?

866
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,909
You said they were sisters.

867
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:19,411
Oh, you're right. Yeah.
You know what I mean.

868
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,406
Why are you jumping
on me like that?

869
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,582
It's fun. Fun.

870
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,415
Fun.

871
00:57:30,247 --> 00:57:33,251
Yeah, Marv thought
he was a tough guy.

872
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,761
Mmm. We had a crew once.

873
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:39,763
Back in the day, when we was
young, we made a little money...

874
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,769
but it was never, you know...

875
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,763
So a mean crew rolls into
town, and, you know...

876
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,333
we flinched. That's it.
End of the crew.

877
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,773
But you're still in the life.

878
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,777
Me? No.

879
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:56,111
No. No, no, no.

880
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,442
I just tend the bar.

881
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,202
What are you doing? Get in.

882
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,803
You fucking come out here.

883
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,871
Are you nuts? It's freezing!
Get in.

884
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,132
I'm not getting in the car!

885
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,806
You think the trunk's
lined with plastic?

886
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:26,478
How should I know?

887
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:29,377
Here, go look then. Go ahead.

888
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,987
Don't you fuck with me.
Don't you fucking dare!

889
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,323
Nobody’s fucking with you.
You hear?

890
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:40,985
All right? Yeah.

891
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,330
Want to call your mommy
and tell her you're okay?

892
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,697
<i>Dam "yoke.</i>

893
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:53,741
Last time anybody saw my brother
alive, he got in a car with a guy.

894
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,908
All right.

895
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,172
You're right. I'm sorry.

896
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,910
Take it easy.

897
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:08,353
What we got here is a
risk-versus-reward kind of thing.

898
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,491
We took the risk. And up to now,

899
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,856
it's not been working
out so well, I know.

900
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,426
Yeah, but?

901
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,863
But I know where the Super
Bowl drop off will be.

902
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,167
So if you want to hit
them back for Bri,

903
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,101
you hit them back for a million.

904
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,533
It's suicide. Fucking suicide.

905
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,170
I got news for you, Fitzy.

906
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,040
We're dead already, we're
just walking around.

907
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,540
The only way to get
out is to leave.

908
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,771
I'm not doing another one, man.

909
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,218
<i>You're not. I'm not.</i>

910
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,210
You sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.

911
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,288
Okay, I'll square
it with you then.

912
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,058
I'm buying something with it.

913
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,562
First, you don't tell anybody
what we just discussed.

914
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,889
You don't tell anybody.

915
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:57,562
Second, I need a place to
hole up for a couple days.

916
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,881
What, you're on the street?

917
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:02,299
You didn't close the trunk.
I closed it.

918
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:03,806
Not very well.

919
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:09,141
I closed that fucking thing.

920
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:12,649
Forget about the trunk. No,
I'm not on the street.

921
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,923
Everybody knows where I live.
Nobody knows where you live.

922
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,316
So can I shack up
with you tonight

923
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,918
or maybe tomorrow night?

924
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:22,994
Not with me, but I know a place.

925
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:24,591
All right?

926
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:26,323
Got cable?

927
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,262
Motherfucker, what?

928
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:29,429
You know, cable.

929
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:31,770
Fuck you.

930
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,934
You have to get behind it!
Slam it with two hands!

931
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:47,846
Here you are.

932
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:56,346
Good night.

933
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,854
Good night.

934
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,856
I got that.

935
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,193
Bob?

936
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:09,530
Thanks.

937
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,536
For what?

938
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:14,869
Good night.

939
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:40,061
Sorry I was so long.

940
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,727
I didn't take you with me.
You want a chewie?

941
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,594
Here.

942
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,238
<i>There you go. For you.</i>

943
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:22,971
Oh.

944
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:25,640
Mind if I sit down?

945
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:26,907
<i>No, have</i> a <i>seat.</i>

946
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:37,455
What's up?

947
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:43,925
I was wondering why you
don't like my cousin.

948
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,758
He took my dog.

949
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,490
He didn't take your dog.

950
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,763
You beat the crap out of it
and put it in a trash can.

951
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,633
I felt bad about it.

952
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,639
That count?

953
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:56,933
Yeah.

954
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,643
Okay, good.

955
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,645
And now you want it back.

956
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,975
What kind of question is that?
I don't know what I want.

957
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:05,817
I don't know.

958
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:10,284
But I don't want him walking
around thinking he's the shit.

959
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:12,293
He needs to learn.

960
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:14,159
Learn what?

961
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,294
That he shouldn't
have fucked with me.

962
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:20,964
Are you fucking with me?

963
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,830
Me'? No, no.

964
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,799
I'm too old for that shit.
I come in peace.

965
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,331
Why is that? Is there a war?

966
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:30,505
Not that I know of.

967
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:32,473
Good.

968
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:35,817
In the bar the other night,
you made my cousin nervous.

969
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,475
You don't see that often.

970
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:42,516
I think there's a way you
and I can sort that out...

971
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:44,848
and both be happy.

972
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:01,537
Look at you.
You're looking good.

973
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,339
Eric Deeds' psych file.

974
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,881
You got three
minutes to read it.

975
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,616
There better be no
grease on those fingers.

976
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:27,224
Well, I'll be damned.

977
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:29,401
Like you fucking
weren't already?

978
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:35,072
What? Not what you
were expecting?

979
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:37,909
My file?

980
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:39,911
Yeah.

981
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:18,441
You know what you're gonna do?

982
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,115
You got to give me 10.

983
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,120
Ten grand. By tomorrow morning.

984
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,823
Who's got $10,000?

985
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,124
Come on.

986
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,125
Listen. You want the dog,
you give me 10. Simple.

987
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:38,030
Listen here, pal.

988
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,247
You can't walk into people's
lives and expect them to-

989
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,639
Listen, listen. Take it easy.
Listen to me.

990
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,777
That is life. That's what it is.

991
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:50,144
People like me coming along
when you're not looking.

992
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:53,477
Just get my money, 10:00
a.m., your place, okay?

993
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:57,485
And if you don't get it, I'll go
to the cops and get my dog back.

994
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,954
Simple. And then I'll forget
to feed it for a while.

995
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,790
And then when the dog gets
all yappy about it...

996
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,325
l'll beat his fucking
head with a rock.

997
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,168
All right? You picture that.

998
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,672
Yeah.

999
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,843
Remember what I did
to Richie Whelan.

1000
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,503
Yep.

1001
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,546
And I had a partner back then.
I still have him.

1002
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:25,847
Mmm-hmm.

1003
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,886
You okay? Mmm-hmm.

1004
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,979
Okay. It was good to see you.

1005
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:47,705
Bobby, how's it going?
Good. You?

1006
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,169
Good.

1007
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:53,874
What's happening? I thought
you took early retirement.

1008
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,343
What can you do? I'll
do another year or two.

1009
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:00,544
Hope the phlebitis don't get too bad.
See how I feel. Marv?

1010
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,050
I'm heading out to work.

1011
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,449
Good day, Dot.

1012
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:05,548
You, too!

1013
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:07,725
Are you going to eat something?

1014
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,189
Yeah.

1015
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:10,557
<i>Okay</i>

1016
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:19,214
Biggest day in the
world tomorrow,

1017
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,242
I can't get you on the phone.

1018
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:24,535
Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell
you, I don't feel good...

1019
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,577
so I'm not coming in.

1020
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,910
Call the BarTemps.

1021
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,582
I did already.

1022
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:35,420
Super Bowl. We always use them.

1023
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,589
So what do you need me for?

1024
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:39,922
I don't.

1025
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,423
But."

1026
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:49,093
you're blowing off the
biggest tip day of the year.

1027
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:52,436
What, I work for tips now?

1028
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,435
You ever go to the
front of the bar.“

1029
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:58,076
and look at the sign on the bar?
Whose name is on it?

1030
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,841
That's my name.

1031
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:03,784
'Cause I used to own it once.

1032
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:06,783
Yeah, you been playing that
flute a long time now.

1033
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:11,451
And you've been awfully
fresh since...

1034
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:14,785
you got that dog that
you mistake for a kid.

1035
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:18,129
Marv, you can't redo it.

1036
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:21,795
All right? They
pressed, you blinked.

1037
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,127
It's done. It's over.

1038
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:27,802
It's been over for a while now.

1039
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:36,474
Well, I'm not the guy who wasted his
entire life waiting for it to start.

1040
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,051
I did that? Mmm-hmm.

1041
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,986
At least I had something once.

1042
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:45,649
I was respected. I was feared.

1043
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,026
When I walked into a
place, people sat up.

1044
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:51,155
They sat up straight.
They noticed.

1045
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,160
What's! you ever have'?

1046
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:56,493
And the fucking bar stool
you put that old biddy at.

1047
01:09:56,826 --> 01:10:00,672
You don't think I don't know
that you did it on purpose?

1048
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:04,570
That was my stool and
nobody sat on that stool

1049
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:06,027
because it was
Cousin Marv's stool.

1050
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,337
And that meant something.

1051
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,840
That meant something!

1052
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,017
But it didn't

1053
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,020
Ever.

1054
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:22,026
It was just a stool.

1055
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,701
Are you doing
something desperate?

1056
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,604
Again?

1057
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,365
Marv?

1058
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:42,710
Are you doing something that maybe
we can't clean up this time?

1059
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,213
I told you, I don't feel good.

1060
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:50,123
So why don't you get
the fuck out of here?

1061
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:52,890
Really.

1062
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,893
Good-bye, Marv.

1063
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,557
I hope you feel better soon.

1064
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,062
Don't forget to eat something.

1065
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:33,494
<i>The
Body of Christ.</i>

1066
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:36,597
The Body of Christ.

1067
01:11:38,261 --> 01:11:39,934
The Body of Christ.

1068
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:42,940
The Body of Christ.

1069
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,674
The Body of Christ.

1070
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:07,965
Should we go?

1071
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:09,959
Let's move out.

1072
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:21,475
Rocco, I'll have to
lock you down in a sec.

1073
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,647
We have a long day.

1074
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,184
<i>Hey, BM, how you doing'!?</i>

1075
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:11,361
I got to... l got
to talk to you.

1076
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:13,692
I want to take you
someplace tonight.

1077
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:16,530
It's a lot of fun.

1078
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,036
Then we're out of here.

1079
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,494
Hi. How you doing?

1080
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:19,664
What do you want?

1081
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:23,167
I don't want you here.
Please leave.

1082
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:26,100
No, listen to me. Sit clown
and listen to me, okay?

1083
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:29,003
I want you to go.
This is my home.

1084
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:32,942
I'm not your girl anymore.
I want you to leave.

1085
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:38,842
Come on, take a seat. Come on.

1086
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:41,019
Don't play that shit. Sit down.

1087
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:49,121
You look good, by the way.

1088
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:53,364
We're going somewhere tonight.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

1089
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,965
And after that,
we're out of here.

1090
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:59,529
I want you to go. Please.

1091
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,538
You're going to go.

1092
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:07,541
And make yourself
pretty, all right?

1093
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,331
Good to see you, man.

1094
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:28,897
Where you been?

1095
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:30,299
I came back to see you, Jimmy.

1096
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,129
He said, I'm coming
right back for you.

1097
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:54,922
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1098
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:57,157
<i>please rise and
remove your hats.“...</i>

1099
01:15:57,353 --> 01:16:01,699
<i>..</i> . <i>as we honor America with the
singing of our national anthem.</i>

1100
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,527
Two Dos
Equis, three Amstel,

1101
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,868
two shots of Jack and a
Dewar's on the rocks.

1102
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,232
You hear that, Rardy?

1103
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:08,330
Coming up.

1104
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,063
Hey, Bob?

1105
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:15,931
Bob?

1106
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:17,066
Bob!

1107
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:19,739
Can I get two more
Heineken on 1-3?

1108
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,605
Rardy? Two more Heineken.

1109
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,451
White wine, right? Yeah.

1110
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,996
<i>Can you get me a Sm“ rocks</i>

1111
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:13,624
and a house Chard for the lady?

1112
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:18,502
I didn't see you this morning.

1113
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,467
Yeah, so what?

1114
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,470
So you don't want the money?

1115
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,306
You bring it? What?

1116
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:27,981
Did you bring the money?

1117
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:31,340
You strike me as the
type who would bring it.

1118
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,483
Two Stella and an Amstel.
Sure.

1119
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:35,986
Rardy, two Amstels and a Stella.

1120
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:37,680
Why is she here?

1121
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,149
She's my girl.

1122
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:46,991
Hmm.

1123
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:55,000
Give me that piece of paper
and you get the money.

1124
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:56,332
What paper?

1125
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:01,178
The microchip and the
license, like we agreed.

1126
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,713
Why would I do that?

1127
01:19:03,005 --> 01:19:07,283
Because that's why I'm paying
you the money. That's the deal.

1128
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,284
That's a deal. Hold on a second.

1129
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:13,790
You can keep the change.
Keep the change.

1130
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:15,551
Two Stellas
and one Amstel.

1131
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,627
What's up? Wait a minute.

1132
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:20,962
I can't talk right now.
Wait a second.

1133
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,633
Here you go.

1134
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,798
What's that noise?
Where are you?

1135
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,631
<i>I'm at the place. Your place.</i>

1136
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,306
The bar?

1137
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,067
Why the fuck you
show up so early?

1138
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:34,341
<i>This was simple. You show
up at {he designated time,</i>

1139
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:35,905
<i>do the thing and lea ve.</i>

1140
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:40,082
I know what he seems like, but I
shit you not, do not fuck with him.

1141
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:41,788
Stay away from him.
He already thinks

1142
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:43,914
you want to kill him
over some fucking dog.

1143
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:45,589
<i>Just stay in the back.</i>

1144
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:47,157
Yeah, I got it.

1145
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,953
And you're in a bar.
Don't drink too much.

1146
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:51,998
I'll see you at 2:00,
you fucking idiot.

1147
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:00,166
What an amazing game!

1148
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:03,500
<i>Twenty-seven to 23,
your final score!</i>

1149
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:25,192
Are you with him? No.

1150
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:26,764
So why are you here?

1151
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,298
What were you talking about?

1152
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:31,531
I told you, nothing.

1153
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:32,795
Bob.

1154
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:35,141
Oh, yeah, we do.

1155
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:37,101
This is not good.
This is so not good.

1156
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,604
I don't want to be here.

1157
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:42,602
I didn't want to come here.

1158
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:46,276
He was waiting in my
house when I got home.

1159
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:52,274
I'm sorry, Bob.

1160
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:59,052
He has a gun.

1161
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,299
I'm going to the ladies'.

1162
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:21,645
What were you talking about?

1163
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,213
Football.

1164
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,151
Give me another shot, will you?

1165
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,229
What was the name
of your partner?

1166
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:49,575
Wouldn't be much of a threat if you
knew who he was, would he, Bob?

1167
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:51,175
Yeah, but...

1168
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:54,341
he helped you kill
Richie Whelan, right?

1169
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,582
That's the rumor, Bob.

1170
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,842
More than a rumor.
It's what you said.

1171
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:03,579
Then it's more than a rumor, Bob.
What time is it?

1172
01:23:04,513 --> 01:23:09,019
You know, you don't have to keep
calling me Bob all the time.

1173
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,422
I'll see what I can do, Bob.
What is that?

1174
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:13,530
The 10 grand you wanted.

1175
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:15,524
This is 10 grand?

1176
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,534
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1177
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:22,365
You know what I think?

1178
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:27,939
I'm going to look in
the safe at 2:00.

1179
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,353
Time lock goes off at 2:00 a.m.

1180
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:35,046
You got 90 seconds
to close it...

1181
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,723
or it triggers two
silent alarms.

1182
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,282
We should look in
the safe at 2:00.

1183
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:43,886
Now you listen.

1184
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:48,557
I'm happy to pay you
10 grand for the dog.

1185
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:52,729
Yeah. Ten grand for the dog.

1186
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:55,534
But that's it.

1187
01:23:56,899 --> 01:23:58,742
And how much for her?

1188
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:03,573
How about that? How much
should he pay for you?

1189
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:07,080
Eric, please. Please
don't do this.

1190
01:24:10,746 --> 01:24:12,589
Where's Marv? Marv?

1191
01:24:13,482 --> 01:24:15,325
You need him for something?

1192
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:17,160
I don't want anything.

1193
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:20,764
I just don't want him creeping
up my back all of a sudden.

1194
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,934
Yeah, my sweet cousin Marv.

1195
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,605
<i>You know he's had some
trouble, Marv. Yeah.</i>

1196
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:32,276
<i>Like, about 10 years
ago, man, he had...</i>

1197
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:33,944
a problem with the cards.

1198
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,281
I didn't know that, Bob.

1199
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:38,781
But he was more of a
loan shark back then.

1200
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:41,948
And I remember this kid.“

1201
01:24:42,344 --> 01:24:44,790
he was into him for a
shitload of money.

1202
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:48,517
Hopeless case when it came
to the dogs and B-ball.

1203
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,221
Just degenerate, really.

1204
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,288
Kind of kid who'd never be
able to pay back what he owed.

1205
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,967
It's 1:57, all right?

1206
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,636
And then the kid goes to A.C.
and he...

1207
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:02,636
hits up a slot machine
for <i>22</i> grand.

1208
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,637
<i>Bam.</i>

1209
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,373
<i>Who'd have thunk it?
It was, like,</i>

1210
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,541
<i>a fraction move than
what he owed Marv.</i>

1211
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:11,807
So he didn't pay up and
you roughed him up.

1212
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,042
No, no. That's not
what happened.

1213
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,214
He paid back Marv, every cent.

1214
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:17,980
He was a good guy.

1215
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,988
It's 1:58, all right?

1216
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,992
What he didn't account for was
Marv skimming off his own stash.

1217
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:26,893
<i>Because of his habits
and his gambling debts.</i>

1218
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:31,069
And this kid coming out of the
blue with 22 grand was a...

1219
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,669
what'd he say?

1220
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:36,506
"A viable business opportunity."

1221
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:38,842
That's my cousin Marv.

1222
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:44,014
So long <i>as</i> nobody knew that he'd
paid Marv back off, you know?

1223
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,183
You see where this is going?

1224
01:25:46,842 --> 01:25:48,344
Yeah, kid had to be ripped off.

1225
01:25:48,577 --> 01:25:51,023
No. Kid had 1:0 be killed.

1226
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:55,084
So nobody'd know he'd
paid Marv back off.

1227
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,757
So that's what we did.

1228
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,363
Oh, so you...

1229
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,929
killed him. Yeah, I did.

1230
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:05,266
I shot him in the face, twice.

1231
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,772
Then I wrapped his
head in a towel

1232
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,206
and stabbed him in the heart...

1233
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:10,808
so he would bleed out,

1234
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:12,868
put him in my bathtub
and watched him drain.

1235
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,204
Then I put him in an oil tank...

1236
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:18,541
with laundry
detergent and lye...

1237
01:26:18,774 --> 01:26:20,117
and sealed it back up.

1238
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:26,548
Want to know what his name was?

1239
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:29,453
It's 2:00, Bob.
It's 2:00.

1240
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:31,061
His name.

1241
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:34,064
I would not know, Bob.

1242
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,749
Yes, you do. This is
something you know.

1243
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,464
I wouldn't knew that, Bob.
Guess.

1244
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:41,067
I know it's 2:00, and you
got to open the safe!

1245
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:42,297
Listen to me.

1246
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:43,907
His name...

1247
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:46,072
was Richie Whelan.

1248
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:50,815
Everybody called him Glory Days?

1249
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:54,645
I killed Richie Whelan, okay?

1250
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,553
Sure you did.

1251
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:28,118
Fucking punk.

1252
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:32,622
Go out to dinner dressed like
you're still in your living room.

1253
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,057
You wear those...

1254
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,125
big hippity-hoppity clown shoes.

1255
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:39,388
You speak to women terribly.
You treat them despicably.

1256
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:42,033
You hurt harmless dogs that
can't defend themselves.

1257
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,398
I'm tired of you, man.

1258
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,730
I'm tired of you.
You embarrass me.

1259
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,798
You know, he would
have kept coming back.

1260
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:53,410
People like this, you let them
take something from you...

1261
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:56,309
and they keep coming back.

1262
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:59,745
You still owe them and
they never, never change.

1263
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:01,977
You can never change their mind.

1264
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:09,426
You just...

1265
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:13,830
I mean, you just
fucking shot him.

1266
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:18,661
Yes, I did. Absolutely. He
was going to hurt our dog.

1267
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:37,112
Bob? Mmm.

1268
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:40,349
Can l... can I go now?

1269
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:43,856
Yeah, of course. You can.

1270
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:48,857
So you... you'll let me go?

1271
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,031
Sure, sure.

1272
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:53,870
Why not?

1273
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:59,535
And, and nobody will ever
hurt you again. Okay?

1274
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:02,709
This is done. Okay?

1275
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:05,712
You got your stuff?

1276
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,385
Go on now.

1277
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:16,556
But now... now you'll
think I'll talk.

1278
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:18,495
I won't talk, Bob.

1279
01:29:19,054 --> 01:29:20,499
I know you won't

1280
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:22,895
I promise. l won’t.

1281
01:29:23,225 --> 01:29:27,071
Nadia, you can't. Not with these people.
They won't...

1282
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:29,405
Your people, Bob.

1283
01:29:29,998 --> 01:29:32,842
No, they're not my...
I'm not them.

1284
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:35,408
And I'm not this.

1285
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:12,068
You've seen better days, huh?

1286
01:32:18,133 --> 01:32:19,476
Andre?

1287
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:30,653
He just came in.

1288
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,825
Yeah, that's right. When
I opened up the door.

1289
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:36,652
I was just letting
Millie out, and...

1290
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:41,161
Put a gun in your face, but
you said, "Not tonight," huh?

1291
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:43,162
I didn't say anything.

1292
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,262
You ever see him before?

1293
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:46,494
Yeah.

1294
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,435
Yeah, he was in here.

1295
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:52,505
Over there, watching the game.

1296
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:56,277
Caught my attention
'cause he was on his own.

1297
01:32:58,173 --> 01:33:00,016
Maybe he wasn't

1298
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:01,578
No, he was, though.

1299
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:02,677
Or maybe he wasn't.

1300
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:04,184
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

1301
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:07,454
Sure you do. You say he
was on his own, alone.

1302
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:09,684
I say he wasn't.
What's to follow?

1303
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:12,454
You.

1304
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:14,799
You're alone.

1305
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:18,197
Sometimes it's good to be alone.

1306
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:20,637
Say it.

1307
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:23,973
Say it.

1308
01:33:26,201 --> 01:33:27,703
I'm alone.

1309
01:33:29,304 --> 01:33:32,217
No way, my man.
You have friends.

1310
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:36,212
Speaking of friends,
your cousin Marv?

1311
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:40,321
He told me he's retiring. He want
you to be the boss of the bar.

1312
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:43,722
<i>I said, "Oi course,
It's your bar."</i>

1313
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,392
<i>"But it's not your money.“</i>

1314
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:49,224
<i>"So why you always trying
to take my money?"</i>

1315
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:51,230
<i>So I made him</i> a <i>deal.</i>

1316
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:55,234
<i>“You and your druggy friends
leave my money alone...</i>

1317
01:33:55,497 --> 01:33:59,741
<i>and I'll pay you a ticket
to a nice, quiet place."</i>

1318
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:04,845
So what do you think?

1319
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:06,145
Hmm?

1320
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:09,745
Take down his name, put up yours.
"Bob's Bar."

1321
01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:13,252
Has a nice ring to it, huh?
"Bob's Bar."

1322
01:34:13,915 --> 01:34:16,293
"Bob's Big Bad Bar."

1323
01:34:16,618 --> 01:34:18,791
I'm kidding, my friend.
Lighten up.

1324
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:21,126
Sure.

1325
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:26,965
Did he fit?

1326
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:30,635
Yeah. Had to break his
legs, but he fit fine.

1327
01:34:30,965 --> 01:34:34,139
Smile. Don't mind,
everything's gonna be okay.

1328
01:34:35,203 --> 01:34:36,876
Get some rest.

1329
01:34:46,814 --> 01:34:47,986
Good night.

1330
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:50,155
Good night.

1331
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:10,839
<i>There are some sins you commit
that you can come back from...</i>

1332
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:13,074
<i>no matter how hard you try.</i>

1333
01:35:13,341 --> 01:35:18,347
<i>You just can't, you know? It's like the
devil is waiting for your body to quit.</i>

1334
01:35:20,348 --> 01:35:23,522
<i>Because he knows...
he knows that“...</i>

1335
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:27,192
<i>he already owns your soul.</i>

1336
01:35:27,422 --> 01:35:31,427
<i>And then I think, maybe, you
know, there is no devil.</i>

1337
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:37,373
<i>"Nah."!</i>

1338
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,202
<i>"Nah, you can come in."</i>

1339
01:35:41,536 --> 01:35:43,709
<i>"You have to leave now."</i>

1340
01:35:44,372 --> 01:35:48,377
<i>"You have to leave and go away
and you have to be alone."</i>

1341
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:52,785
<i>"You have to be alone forever."</i>

1342
01:36:27,248 --> 01:36:29,922
I'm sorry to hear
about Cousin Marv.

1343
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:34,163
It was a carjacking
gone bad is what they said.

1344
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:36,265
Carjacking? Right.

1345
01:36:36,758 --> 01:36:39,602
That was an execution.

1346
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:41,541
A block and a half
from this bar.

1347
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:46,274
Anyway, it fucking sucks
and I'm really sorry.

1348
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:48,444
Thank you.

1349
01:36:50,004 --> 01:36:51,847
Are you going to the
church closing tomorrow?

1350
01:36:52,106 --> 01:36:53,278
Yeah, of course.

1351
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:55,510
I don't know yet. I got a shift.

1352
01:36:56,678 --> 01:37:00,524
They sold it. To Milligan Development.
What'd I tell you?

1353
01:37:00,782 --> 01:37:03,126
Condos with stained
glass windows.

1354
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:08,956
Eric Deeds.

1355
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:11,133
I mentioned him to you once.

1356
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:13,029
Yeah, I remember.

1357
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:14,529
You didn't then.

1358
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:16,700
I remember you mentioning him.

1359
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:20,309
He was in this bar Super Bowl Sunday.
You see him'?

1360
01:37:20,535 --> 01:37:23,175
No. There was a lot
of people in here

1361
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:24,716
on Super Bowl Sunday, so...

1362
01:37:25,473 --> 01:37:26,816
Yeah, that's true.

1363
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:31,380
It's just this was the last place
he was ever seen and then...

1364
01:37:31,813 --> 01:37:33,383
Just like Richie Whelan.

1365
01:37:33,815 --> 01:37:34,885
<i>Mmm.</i>

1366
01:37:34,982 --> 01:37:38,657
Ironic, 'cause Deeds
supposedly killed Whelan.

1367
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:43,332
Bodies getting clipped or vanishing
all over the place, but...

1368
01:37:43,825 --> 01:37:46,499
come on, man, you
don't see anything?

1369
01:37:46,994 --> 01:37:50,498
Nah. You know, that's
this neighborhood, right?

1370
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,339
But he could turn up.

1371
01:37:54,068 --> 01:37:55,741
People do all the time.

1372
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:59,507
That's true. If he does, it'll
probably be in a psych ward.

1373
01:38:00,508 --> 01:38:03,580
Which is where he was the
night Whelan disappeared.

1374
01:38:04,846 --> 01:38:07,520
I'm not lying. It's true.

1375
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:12,091
Deeds always took credit for the Whelan
hit 'cause nobody else wanted to.

1376
01:38:12,353 --> 01:38:14,594
He thought it would
help his street cred...

1377
01:38:14,856 --> 01:38:16,858
but he didn't kill Whelan.

1378
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:18,534
He didn't?

1379
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:28,540
Yeah.

1380
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:40,890
No one ever sees you
coming, do they' Bob?

1381
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:28,937
Rocco. Something
we got to do.

1382
01:39:55,623 --> 01:39:58,968
When you left the bar, I
know that meant stay away.

1383
01:39:59,627 --> 01:40:03,632
I know that meant stay away,
but you didn't say it.

1384
01:40:06,968 --> 01:40:09,972
So if you say it, then...

1385
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:14,309
l will just go. Believe me,
Nadia, I will leave right now.

1386
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:17,149
But you have to say it.

1387
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,662
Let me go get my jacket.

1388
01:40:35,496 --> 01:40:36,668
Yeah?

1389
01:40:37,832 --> 01:40:39,834
Sure, great. Great.

1390
01:41:12,524 --> 01:43:12,524
