1
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:56,769
Pretty windy out

2
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:09,423
That better not be the one
where you blow people up

3
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,192
It's not, Mom

4
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,127
Mm-hmm

5
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,334
Dad, look what I can do

6
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:20,629
I've been practicing

7
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:26,506
That's spectacular, kiddo

8
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:27,873
Cool

9
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:31,979
You're inside out

10
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,344
Oh... I knew that

11
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:37,520
Doesn't work for you?

12
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:41,122
Can't believe you taught him that

13
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,119
I didn't... He did it on his own

14
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:48,090
Charlie, did you brush your teeth?

15
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,997
- Yes
- Charlie...

16
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:51,225
I brushed them

17
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:52,233
Let me see

18
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:53,234
Look at this, Con...

19
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,100
Let's go. I'm serious

20
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:58,064
You're driving me bonkers, Mom...

21
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:00,266
Let's go

22
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:02,239
Con, remember when we
were gonna buy Omnidel

23
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,746
you said no?

24
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:05,411
You remember what
the price was?

25
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,881
Uh, 1.50 $

26
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:10,113
Close. 61 $

27
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,153
I'll do it, Mom

28
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:12,745
No, I'm gonna do it

29
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:14,882
You know what it's
going for now, Con?

30
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:16,755
- Say, "e"
- Eeeee

31
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,556
Guess, Con

32
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,858
Edward, I don't know, all right?

33
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,092
All right, now rinse

34
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,395
74 $

35
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,667
Really rinse. And pee

36
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,267
I should've bought it. Shit

37
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:31,901
So buy some

38
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,109
Too late, Con. Too late

39
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:36,209
Lift the seat, honey

40
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,582
Don't forget to put it down!

41
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,456
When you finish...

42
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:51,759
Do you really need all that stuff?

43
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:55,495
Mom... no one wears these dorky hats

44
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,729
Well, you do, and you're not a dork

45
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,264
How do I look?

46
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,830
Very handsome

47
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:05,468
Love you... Ok. Come on, let's go!

48
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,645
Whoa. Jesus!

49
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:10,111
Come on

50
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:11,647
Whoa!

51
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:13,314
Maybe you shouldn't go in today

52
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,946
I promised I'd do that
stuff for the auction...

53
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:17,111
And someone's got
a birthday coming up

54
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:19,587
Latrell Sprewell jersey, Mom

55
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,123
Don't forget

56
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,817
He's on the Yankees, right?

57
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:24,189
Mom...

58
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,923
You're driving me bonkers

59
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:29,196
You're driving him bonkers

60
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:35,069
Jesus...

61
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:37,134
<i>...it's a holiday there</i>

62
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,367
<i>Well, I'll just keep talking</i>

63
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,774
<i>No, no, that's ok.
But in order to pick up...</i>

64
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,296
Taxi!

65
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,690
Shit!

66
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:14,795
Taxi!

67
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:18,605
Taxi. Taxi!

68
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,746
Oh... Shit!

69
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:58,606
I'm so sorry!

70
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:01,107
- Oh, putanne! Mes bouquins!
- I'm so sorry

71
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:03,085
Putanne! Mes bouquins!

72
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:05,618
I'm sorry

73
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:08,047
I'll get your things

74
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,131
Aw, shit!

75
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:21,127
Taxi! Taxi!

76
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,001
My books! Putanne!...

77
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:39,147
I need a taxi!
Could you help me get a taxi?

78
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:40,181
Ok

79
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,388
I'll watch your books

80
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:44,091
- Thanks
- Thank you

81
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:49,228
Hey. Hey!

82
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:53,391
Hey!

83
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:07,742
Bad day for taxis

84
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:09,852
It's this horrible wind

85
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:12,453
Yeah. You shot down
there like a bullet!

86
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:15,355
If you flapped your arms,
you'd be home by now

87
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,620
I'll remember that next time

88
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,221
That's not good

89
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:22,356
I know

90
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:26,397
Listen, that's me up there...
the flower pot

91
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,604
I get you a band-aid, ok?

92
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:36,812
Hold on to something.
Don't blow away

93
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:43,213
Or... you can come on
up and clean it off, no?

94
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,581
Come on!

95
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,221
I'm not an ax murderer. I promise

96
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,136
Oh, shit

97
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,907
Fucking elevator

98
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,008
Ne marche pas jamais cet ascenseur!

99
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,909
Ascenseur de merde!

100
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,042
Allez! One more!

101
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:36,803
Pardon the mess

102
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,702
You a writer?

103
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:42,945
I'm a book dealer

104
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,938
Oh...

105
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:49,042
Uh... bathroom's right
down there, on the left

106
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:53,488
Go ahead

107
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,390
There's a medicine cabinet

108
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:59,025
You can sneak a peak
at my prescriptions

109
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,125
Hello

110
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,636
I made you some tea

111
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:22,038
Thank you

112
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,077
Do you box?

113
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:28,384
I used to... when I was young

114
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:30,413
Hmm

115
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:32,480
This is an amazing place

116
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,979
Uh-huh

117
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:35,788
Yeah, but it's not mine

118
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:36,959
No?

119
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,721
The owner is a friend, a sculptor

120
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:41,755
and he's living in Paris,
so... that's cool

121
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:44,199
We can stay here, me and my books

122
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:47,829
Hmm

123
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:51,867
Um, I... can I use your phone?

124
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,008
I have to call home

125
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,734
Oh, sure, sure. There's
a phone just behind you

126
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,276
Thank you

127
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,382
Gloria? Hi, it's me

128
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:06,956
Good, good

129
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:08,855
How's Charlie?

130
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,356
Hi, honey. How was
your day at school?

131
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:14,593
Yeah? What was the best part?

132
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:19,263
Guess what. Can you believe
that mommy missed her train?

133
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,768
Um...

134
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:27,810
Ice

135
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,544
Uh... about an hour

136
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,815
You should start your homework

137
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:38,483
No. I promise to tell you
all about it when I see you

138
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,321
I love you. Bye

139
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:43,655
That was my son Charlie

140
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,096
He's 8. He'll be 9 next week

141
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:50,494
I'm Paul Martel.
I'll be 28 in July

142
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:53,401
I'm Constance

143
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:56,035
And I'm late. I have to go

144
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:59,865
Before you go, take your book... no?

145
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:05,337
Oh, no, I... I couldn't. I don't...

146
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,043
Sure, you can

147
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,911
A souvenir

148
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,616
Go down there

149
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,650
You know, like before

150
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,388
Ok

151
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:24,126
Keep going...

152
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,227
Stop!

153
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:28,101
Now right

154
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,205
No. Right

155
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,035
Ok, now... the second
shelf from the top...

156
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:38,813
Take the fourth one
from the left

157
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:40,514
Got it?

158
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:42,918
Think so

159
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:45,283
Open to page 23

Can you find your way out?

172
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:27,527
I hope so

173
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,061
That's my bedroom

174
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:38,241
It was nice meeting you, Constance

175
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,736
Hey, come back if you need more
books or... medical attention

176
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:16,704
<i>A perfect 10 there!</i>

177
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:19,577
<i>Oh, my! Did you see that?</i>

178
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,181
Hey, Glo, hey

179
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,987
That wouldn't be
the TV on, would it?

180
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,315
I was just turning it off

181
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:30,993
Sure you were

182
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:39,167
The wind knocked me down today, Glo

183
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:43,294
Oh, yeah? You all right?
Do you need anything?

184
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,173
Gross!

185
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:50,034
- Were you in a fight?
- No, just fell over

186
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,237
Does it hurt?

187
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,379
A little bit

188
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,872
Cool!

189
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,178
Where are you going?

190
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,919
To get the camera!

191
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:59,215
- Try this
- Thank you

192
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:02,616
What do you need a camera for?

193
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,484
It's for school.
We're doing blood and stuff

194
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,958
Ok, now look like it really hurts

195
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,592
- Ready?
- Yep

196
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,431
This'll be great

197
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,330
The wind blew her down...

198
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,608
She bled and everything

199
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,600
Everybody's hats blew off

200
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:23,335
Look who's the worid photographer

201
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:23,879
You ok?

202
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:26,541
Yeah... It took me
down like an old lady

203
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:28,647
- Honey...
- It's humiliating

204
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,146
Dad, look at the pictures

205
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:35,215
At least we got the evidence.
Anyone we can sue?

206
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,385
- Whoa!
- No

207
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:39,353
There was this nice
guy who helped me

208
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:42,029
It was like this, Dad. It was a twister

209
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,393
Dad, look!

210
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:50,134
It was like this. This is a tornado

211
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,139
He lived around there. He got me
some Band-Aids and put me in a taxi

212
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,107
Is he good-looking?

213
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,044
I feel sick

214
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,186
Did you do your homework, Charlie?

215
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,817
I can't. I don't know how to do it

216
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,922
Well, come on. I'll help you

217
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,686
You can help me with mine

218
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:15,429
Did you get his name? This guy?

219
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:18,096
You can send him a bottle a wine

220
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:20,929
Cheap wine

221
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:39,451
Con, stand there a second.
Con, wait a minute...

222
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,282
Just stay there a second. I'm just
trying to figure out how to do the...

223
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,419
The thing I can't
figure out is the, um...

224
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,055
...zoom thing here

225
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:52,399
There it is. Ok, hold on. Stay there

226
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:55,332
The zooming thingie... zooming in

227
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,603
Stay there. No, come on. I'm just
trying to figure this thing out

228
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,472
I want to see if it focuses...

229
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,372
Hold on. Come here

230
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:09,641
Cool. Very cool

231
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,684
So beautiful

232
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,623
If you only knew... Look at you

233
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,785
God, what a beauty

234
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:27,901
Something the matter?

235
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,264
Nothing

236
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,374
Nothing at all

237
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:35,936
Good

238
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:37,938
Come here

239
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:54,518
- This is really good
- No, it isn't. Go away

240
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:56,462
- Come here
- This is major

241
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:02,961
I think it really is zooming in

242
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:04,364
I found the zoom

243
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:05,805
Found it

244
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:08,173
Dad!

245
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:09,928
<i>Mom!</i>

246
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,613
Shit! Ok...

247
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:14,340
<i>I can't sleep!</i>

248
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:17,175
- That camera...
- Jesus!

249
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:22,016
I'll be back. I'll be back...
Don't fall asleep

250
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:24,625
It works!

251
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:32,100
Mom, are you nuts?

252
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,335
You forgot my lunch

253
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,529
I did not

254
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:38,164
It's by the door.
Come with me

255
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,572
What are you chew...
what are you chewing?

256
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,443
Nothing

257
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,277
Spit that out. What is that?

258
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:47,095
Oh...

259
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:48,509
That's lovely

260
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:49,885
- Mom?
- Yes?

261
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,285
I don't want to be a dumb bunny

262
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,118
Honey, it's a play

263
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:55,885
There's lots of other bunnies

264
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:57,859
It would be cool
to be a bunny

265
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,760
- You're bonkers, Mom
- That's what you tell me

266
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,628
- Love you
- Love you, too. What's that?

267
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:05,564
Oh. Thank you

268
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:11,062
Bye

269
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:25,445
Shit

270
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,625
<i>Hi, this is Paul Martel</i>

271
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:20,759
<i>Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks.</i>

272
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:24,870
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

273
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:25,872
Hello?

274
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,208
- Hello
- Hello!

275
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:28,934
You're... you're there

276
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,413
This is Connie Sumner

277
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,814
The one from the really windy day

278
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:35,478
Oh, that one!

279
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:39,187
How's the knee?
Did you ice it?

280
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:42,286
Yes, I iced it and
I elevated it and...

281
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:46,093
...you name it, I did it,
and it's much better and I...

282
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:48,961
And I... I just wanted to call and
I wanted to thank you and, um...

283
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:50,823
I wanted to ask for your address

284
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,199
<i>because I wanted to
send you a bottle of...</i>

285
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:54,233
- Where are you?
- What?

286
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,901
I said where are you?

287
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:00,675
I'm in Grand Central

288
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,201
It's really hard to hear you

289
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:04,679
Come and see me

290
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:05,839
<i>What?</i>

291
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:07,641
Yeah, take a break

292
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,984
I'll make you some coffee

293
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,083
Coffee...

294
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,391
Um...

295
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:21,689
Uh... ok

296
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:23,290
Ok

297
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,261
See you. Bye

298
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:26,794
Fuck

299
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:40,816
Ah, no permanent damage, I see

300
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:46,853
We take Medicaid, Blue Cross...

301
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:49,452
I'm uninsured

302
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,826
No, I'm afraid we don't
take charity cases here

303
00:23:58,401 --> 00:23:59,759
It was a joke

304
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:10,236
Oh, look at this...

305
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:11,906
Jack London

306
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:13,979
First edition of "White Fang"

307
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:16,750
In the original dust jacket.
And you know what?

308
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:18,780
I got it for a buck & 50

309
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:20,846
What's it worth?

310
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:23,758
About 4,000 times more!

311
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:28,890
Those are in French

312
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,526
I took it in school

313
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:35,700
Ah. Uh... "Tu veux
enlever ton manteau?"

314
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:39,568
Do I want to take off something?

315
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:43,112
Um... your coat

316
00:24:43,613 --> 00:24:46,044
Would you like to
take off your coat?

317
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,249
Yes, my coat...

318
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:50,413
Thank you

319
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:02,326
But I can't stay very long.
I have some errands I have to run

320
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:06,434
- I'll get the coffee
- Ok

321
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:14,967
Shit

322
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:29,991
It's in Braille

323
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:31,958
Braille

324
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:35,022
No, no. Braille.
He was French

325
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,230
Close your eyes

326
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:39,800
What?

327
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:41,835
Close your eyes

328
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:59,688
<i>"My mother makes me chicken"</i>

329
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,250
<i>"Her chicken makes me cough"</i>

330
00:26:07,463 --> 00:26:10,630
<i>"I wish that when she made it"</i>

331
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:14,093
<i>"she took the feathers off"</i>

332
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,032
It doesn't say that

333
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,117
I had better go

334
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:36,020
- Huh?
- I got to go

335
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:43,061
Uh... take care. Don't fall

336
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:45,196
Thanks for the coffee

337
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:47,894
You didn't drink it

338
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,648
Hi

339
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:05,851
Lindsay, hi

340
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:07,752
Ah, Connie...

341
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,155
- Let me buzz him
- Thanks

342
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:15,455
Hey, what a surprise

343
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:16,823
Look at you!

344
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,631
- Hi, Bill
Hi, Connie

345
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:19,633
Am I interrupting?

346
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:21,363
- No, no
- I was just leaving

347
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:24,003
All right, I'll, uh, I'll get you
the budget for those trucks later

348
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:25,238
All right. Thanks

349
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,535
Would you like a coffee?

350
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:28,874
No, thank you

351
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:34,076
Mmm

352
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:38,207
- Ah, that's nice
- Mmm. Mmm

353
00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:40,352
You know, I didn't know
you were coming in today

354
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,914
I could've given you a ride

355
00:27:42,024 --> 00:27:44,357
You're freezing. What is that?

356
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,991
Well, I was around the corner,
and I brought you a present

357
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:50,657
Wow. What's the occasión?

358
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,432
Nothing. I don't know

359
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:57,404
It's a medium, but
they said it runs large

360
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:59,699
Look at that!

361
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,606
You don't have to try it on

362
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:04,436
I'm the boss. I can do
whatever I want

363
00:28:12,888 --> 00:28:14,216
What do you think?

364
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:17,883
Hold on just a second

365
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:21,056
Yeah?

366
00:28:21,964 --> 00:28:25,527
Oh, all right, but
hold the other calls

367
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:27,999
You're busy. I'll go

368
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:30,734
- I'll go
- No. Sit. Sit. Sit

369
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:32,100
Hello, Henry...

370
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,809
Yeah, so what is this
suspensión problem?

371
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:37,207
No, I never received it

372
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:41,315
Well, all right.
Well, get it to me

373
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:44,482
Henry, this... No,
it's not good enough

374
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:46,911
I'm sitting here with 200
trucks that I can't use

375
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:48,618
All right. Well, set up a meeting

376
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:51,186
Yeah, and I want
Frank Burnbaum there

377
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:53,227
'Cause I don't feel
good about this guy

378
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:55,926
When I tell someone to do
something, I want it done

379
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,223
I'm sure you will

380
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:02,571
Anyway...

381
00:29:03,572 --> 00:29:06,064
So, what else you up to?

382
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:09,074
- Auction
- Yeah?

383
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,401
Who'd you hit on?

384
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,709
The usual suspects...

385
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:19,051
Who?

386
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:24,323
- Bob Gaylord
- Bob?

387
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:29,161
You get a pledge out of Bob, they
should send you to the middle east

388
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:37,503
So, tell me...

389
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:40,706
What?

390
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:44,443
What do you think?

391
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:46,275
It's a keeper!

392
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:48,547
Jeez

393
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,678
Hello

394
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:53,281
Hello

395
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:00,555
Here I am again

396
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:02,754
I brought muffins

397
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:05,655
"Tu veux enlever ton manteau?"

398
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,568
What is this music?

399
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,243
You like it?

400
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:22,742
Yes

401
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:26,510
Do you want to dance?

402
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,081
Now?

403
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:30,709
Yeah

404
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:33,554
Ok

405
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:39,218
I have to warn you,
I tend to lead

406
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:41,656
Of course. You are American

407
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:55,036
You've done this before

408
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:56,807
Uh, what?

409
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:02,374
How many girlfriends
have you had?

410
00:32:04,654 --> 00:32:07,748
Um... two

411
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:10,382
Really?

412
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,285
Would I lie to you?

413
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:15,393
I don't know, would you?

414
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:36,610
Your eyes are amazing,
you know that?

415
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:39,385
You should never shut them.
Not even at night

416
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:42,755
You should learn to sleep
with your eyes open

417
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:47,595
I'll work on that

418
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:49,994
Will you?

419
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:54,965
Hang on

420
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:01,670
I think this is a mistake

421
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,448
There's no such thing as a mistake

422
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:09,273
There's what you do
and what you don't do

423
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,621
I can't do this

424
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:27,533
I forgot my coat

425
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,036
I can't. I can't

426
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:47,132
What? What's wrong?

427
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:49,177
I can't. I don't know
how to do this

428
00:35:49,278 --> 00:35:51,405
- This is wrong
- Hit me

429
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:52,780
I don't want to

430
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:54,409
Hit me

431
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:02,013
Hit me

432
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:37,883
<i>Say, Ed!</i>

433
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:40,214
<i>- Hey, Bob!
- Haven't seen you in a while</i>

434
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,854
No. No. I've been
working late this week

435
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:44,993
How's the boy?

436
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:47,257
He's a pistol of a kid.
He's gonna have a birthday

437
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:48,295
- Really? How old?
- 9

438
00:37:48,697 --> 00:37:51,628
So, uh, any major armed robberies?

439
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:53,759
No. No, not this week

440
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,496
Speaking of armed robberies...

441
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:57,001
...you better watch out for Connie

442
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,099
She's gonna get you to
sign over your mortgage

443
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,835
What do you mean?

444
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,705
Did she try to hit
on you for some money?

445
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:04,542
No

446
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,846
I thought she talked
to you about this...

447
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,345
...uh, school auction... or whatever

448
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:10,649
Not me

449
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,250
But I've been out of town. Maybe
she talked to Maggie about it

450
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,723
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I got it wrong

451
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:20,090
Anyway, we owe you a dinner

452
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:23,195
Yeah

453
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:34,107
He's out

454
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:35,975
Mmm

455
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,737
Can I get
you anything?

456
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:41,812
No. No, I'm fine. Thanks

457
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:46,945
Tough day?

458
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:49,289
Mmm, not really

459
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:52,951
How about you?
How was your day?

460
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,825
It was good

461
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:58,391
You know, the usual stuff

462
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:07,239
Sure you don't want anything?

463
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:09,408
No

464
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:11,844
Con?

465
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:13,406
Yeah?

466
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:16,384
Do you love me?

467
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:19,487
Of course I love you

468
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:22,982
What a silly question

469
00:39:24,293 --> 00:39:28,593
I guess... I'm just feeling silly

470
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:35,697
I'll be up in a minute

471
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:37,202
Ok

472
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,838
Sorry

473
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,364
What are we doing here?

474
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:49,804
Having lunch

475
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:54,206
I shouldn't be doing this

476
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,576
What, you shouldn't be having lunch?

477
00:41:56,678 --> 00:41:58,472
Not with you

478
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,011
I think we should leave

479
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:08,255
Listen...

480
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:11,649
see those guys over
there paying the check?

481
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:15,661
- Yes
- Ok

482
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:19,028
If the guy on the right pays,
we'll leave right now

483
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:22,802
If the guy on the left pays, we stay

484
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:27,634
And... I kiss you

485
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:30,234
No. No

486
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:32,939
<i>No. No. No</i>

487
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:35,448
Ah. Ah...

488
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,814
Hey, you're kidding me, man

489
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:43,281
I win

490
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:48,120
No

491
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,658
- C'est la vie!
- No

492
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:53,098
Don't do it. Don't

493
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:08,506
Room for two?

494
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,100
Of course

495
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:48,977
Nice music

496
00:44:48,984 --> 00:44:50,551
What is it?

497
00:44:51,787 --> 00:44:54,121
It's, um...

498
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:56,914
African, I think

499
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:59,316
I like it

500
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:28,010
Here

501
00:45:59,955 --> 00:46:03,424
Let's go to bed.
Come on

502
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:05,390
Stay here with me

503
00:46:05,494 --> 00:46:06,292
I'm cold

504
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:07,955
- Stay here
- I'm cold

505
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:13,829
Stay here with me

506
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:14,833
I'm cold

507
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,961
Come on, let's go

508
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:46,433
How about lunch today?

509
00:46:46,935 --> 00:46:48,332
You free?

510
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:53,330
I have all this fund-raiser
stuff Auction things to pick up

511
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:55,065
We can do an early one, if you want

512
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:56,769
How about 12:00?

513
00:46:56,878 --> 00:46:58,573
12:00?

514
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,942
Yeah

515
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:06,081
Will I be hungry at 12:00?

516
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:15,792
We could go in together

517
00:47:15,897 --> 00:47:17,791
I'll wait for you

518
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,830
I'm not gonna be ready
to go for at least an hour

519
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:23,802
That's all right. I'll wait

520
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:39,784
- Oh, shit
What?

521
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:41,618
I just remembered...

522
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:46,486
I have a facial at 12:30
at Georgiana's today

523
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:49,291
Oh, well...

524
00:47:50,698 --> 00:47:53,395
You gotta stay beautiful, right?

525
00:47:57,472 --> 00:47:59,830
Georgiana's, huh?

526
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,534
Waste of money

527
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:23,752
Yeah, Manhattan

528
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:27,355
Uh, beauty salon called, uh, Georgina

529
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:32,900
Uh, yeah, right. Yes. Yes.
Georgiana's. That's right

530
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:36,739
Thank you

531
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:47,613
Hello, I'm calling to confirm
an appointment today, 12:30

532
00:48:48,953 --> 00:48:52,948
Sumner. Connie Sumner.
S- u-m-n-e-r

533
00:48:57,128 --> 00:49:01,862
Could she... could she
be down for another time?

534
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:08,495
<i>No, thank you</i>

535
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,493
Connie!

536
00:49:32,497 --> 00:49:35,324
Connie! Connie...

537
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,967
- Tracy! Hi!
- Hi

538
00:49:38,002 --> 00:49:39,462
I was gonna call you

539
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,162
That's what they all say when
I call about bunny costumes

540
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:44,532
You know Sally
from Planned Parenthood?

541
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:45,639
Hi. It's been a while

542
00:49:45,744 --> 00:49:47,342
Well, too long. Too long

543
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:48,762
You look amazing

544
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:49,980
So where you headed?

545
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:52,011
Oh, I was just going to, um...

546
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:54,176
go look at some window
shades for the kitchen

547
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:55,912
Well, we're gonna go
and have coffee

548
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,718
Why don't you join us?

549
00:49:57,721 --> 00:50:00,022
Oh, I'm gonna be late

550
00:50:00,024 --> 00:50:02,151
For window shades?

551
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,106
Come on!

552
00:50:04,141 --> 00:50:06,353
Ok. Ok

553
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:13,296
Hi, how are you?

554
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,710
I'm just going to make
a phone call

555
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:23,343
Sure

556
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:27,118
Mmm. She could have
used my cell phone

557
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:33,350
Hi, it's me

558
00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:35,792
You're not gonna believe this...

559
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:37,989
I'm at the cafe
around the corner

560
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:41,520
Why do you have to introduce me
as Sally from Planned Parenthood?

561
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,497
What do you mean?

562
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,798
Well, it makes it sound like I'm
in New York handing out condoms

563
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,605
I'm stuck here

564
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:51,834
Will you wait for me?

565
00:50:52,443 --> 00:50:53,740
Wait for me

566
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:57,246
...with the redhead.
Just can't take it

567
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:59,145
She has it the next
morning... all the time

568
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,512
Had to call Gloria, remind her...

569
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:03,086
to pick up the dry cleaning
when she gets Charlie

570
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:05,383
Never a dull moment

571
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,958
No. Charlie is so adorable

572
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,924
Thank you

573
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:28,312
I can't eat

574
00:51:30,848 --> 00:51:31,815
I'll have a coffee

575
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,511
Well, I guess I'll have coffee, too

576
00:51:35,653 --> 00:51:38,144
Excuse me again.
Ladies room

577
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:43,921
- God, she looks good
- Mm-hmm

578
00:51:43,928 --> 00:51:45,486
Do you think she's had work?

579
00:51:45,597 --> 00:51:48,330
Why would she have work?
She still looks gorgeous

580
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:49,427
That's when they're having it now

581
00:51:49,534 --> 00:51:51,558
Early, before it all goes to shit

582
00:52:06,818 --> 00:52:08,751
I have friends out there

583
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,285
You take me to the best places

584
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:20,186
Wait

585
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:22,361
Let me...

586
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:28,934
She's not like that.
She's really nice

587
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,573
Of course she is.
That makes it worse

588
00:52:31,676 --> 00:52:33,971
She is nice, and she's sweet...

589
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:35,945
and her ass is in exactly
the same place it was

590
00:52:35,946 --> 00:52:37,812
when she was in college

591
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:45,989
Are you taking tennis?

592
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:49,985
Oh, I wouldn't call
what I do taking tennis

593
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:53,608
- Ok
- There you are

594
00:52:53,643 --> 00:52:55,054
I was beginning to worry

595
00:52:55,066 --> 00:52:57,066
No, it's fine. I'm fine

596
00:52:57,168 --> 00:53:00,069
We thought you were
abducted by that heartthrob

597
00:53:01,171 --> 00:53:02,798
What heartthrob?

598
00:53:02,807 --> 00:53:04,670
You didn't see him at the counter?

599
00:53:04,705 --> 00:53:05,799
He was gorgeous

600
00:53:07,378 --> 00:53:09,140
I miss everything

601
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:10,704
Your button's undone

602
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:12,975
Oh, thank you

603
00:53:17,689 --> 00:53:19,518
That's him

604
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:29,966
I guess I could see the appeal

605
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:33,061
Well, if he looked at me twice,
I would be on my back in a second

606
00:53:33,096 --> 00:53:33,836
Oh, you would not

607
00:53:33,938 --> 00:53:35,496
Oh, I would so. Why not?

608
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:38,495
Well, a couple of reasons.
Adam for one, your kids for another

609
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:41,303
Well, you know, Tracy, they
wouldn't have to know about it

610
00:53:41,979 --> 00:53:43,976
It could be just something
that I did for myself

611
00:53:43,982 --> 00:53:47,247
You know, to... broaden my horizons

612
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:49,183
It'd be like taking a pottery class

613
00:53:49,387 --> 00:53:52,381
Having an affair is nothing
like taking a pottery class

614
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,788
- Could be
- No. It would start out like that

615
00:53:54,826 --> 00:53:57,294
And then, um, something would happen

616
00:53:57,395 --> 00:54:00,429
Someone, uh, finds out,
or someone falls in love...

617
00:54:00,464 --> 00:54:02,422
and it ends disastrously

618
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:06,429
They always end disastrously

619
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,708
Tracy!

620
00:54:18,115 --> 00:54:19,874
No

621
00:54:19,984 --> 00:54:21,382
When?

622
00:54:22,285 --> 00:54:24,045
It was a long time ago

623
00:54:24,655 --> 00:54:28,580
And it's the one thing in my
life I would undo if I could

624
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,426
Did you just fuck me
across the street?

625
00:54:40,571 --> 00:54:42,163
Mm-hmm, I did

626
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:46,298
You know, we could end this
now, and no one would get hurt

627
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,942
Yeah?

628
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:52,714
I think if we ended
this now... I'd get hurt

629
00:54:53,151 --> 00:54:55,919
So, no matter what,
someone get's hurt?

630
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,551
Maybe not

631
00:54:58,055 --> 00:55:00,253
Maybe we'll get tired of each other

632
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:03,018
God, I hope I get tired of you

633
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:09,865
You're in my mind

634
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:15,433
You're the only thing in my
mind when I wake up every morning

635
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:19,831
You're in my brain
before I even open my eyes

636
00:55:19,977 --> 00:55:21,672
What do you think of?

637
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:23,406
It depends

638
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:26,015
If it's a day when I don't know
if I'm going to get to see you

639
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:32,152
I'm anxious... thinking of excuses
to come into the city and see you

640
00:55:36,227 --> 00:55:38,319
And the days you know we meet?

641
00:55:38,429 --> 00:55:39,993
On those days...

642
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:42,897
I'm...

643
00:55:43,598 --> 00:55:44,968
calm...

644
00:55:45,003 --> 00:55:47,430
and... hating myself

645
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:52,269
Oh, God

646
00:55:57,448 --> 00:56:00,042
This is what we have over here

647
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:03,977
And... I'll have it ready
for you this afternoon

648
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:05,778
That happens all the time...

649
00:56:06,858 --> 00:56:09,086
Ed, what's up? It sounded important

650
00:56:11,062 --> 00:56:13,724
I've heard you're talking
with Dunbar and Brinks...

651
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:15,458
a few other companies

652
00:56:15,566 --> 00:56:17,727
Oh, yeah? Where'd you hear that?

653
00:56:19,203 --> 00:56:22,501
Well, look, I mean, I
suppose they could be...

654
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:24,407
uh, wooing me,
if that's what you mean

655
00:56:24,442 --> 00:56:27,676
Apparently a lot of people
are wooing you these days

656
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:29,939
Now, who's wooing who?

657
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:32,507
Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
What are you talking about?

658
00:56:32,617 --> 00:56:34,684
So I talked
to some people. So what?

659
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:36,949
This is about loyalty, Bill

660
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:39,054
I'm letting you go

661
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:42,013
You'll have my
recommendation, if you need it

662
00:56:44,729 --> 00:56:46,856
I have a family, Ed

663
00:56:47,364 --> 00:56:49,859
You had a family here

664
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:54,013
Wait. Wait a minute. You're
telling me... about family?

665
00:56:54,548 --> 00:56:57,560
Well, you don't know the
first goddamn thing about it!

666
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,104
Why don't you take a look at
your own fucking family, Ed?

667
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:07,817
Take a goddamn look at that

668
00:57:26,437 --> 00:57:28,268
- Hi, Ed
- Frank

669
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:33,904
Thanks for coming
on such short notice

670
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:36,813
This is personal.
It's not business...

671
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:39,014
So you think about it

672
00:57:39,049 --> 00:57:41,381
I don't know if you're gonna
want to get involved with this..

673
00:57:41,385 --> 00:57:43,786
but I need someone I can trust

674
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:46,082
I want you to follow somebody

675
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:48,388
I...

676
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:52,621
I want you
to follow my wife

677
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:04,767
It's burning, Mom

678
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:05,875
What?

679
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,575
It's burning.
The chicken

680
00:58:08,578 --> 00:58:10,175
Oh, shit!

681
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,274
Shit

682
00:58:22,793 --> 00:58:24,521
It's boiling, Mom

683
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:26,089
It's boiling!

684
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:27,261
Thank you

685
00:58:31,368 --> 00:58:33,496
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch it. Watch it

686
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,883
Chicken's a little dry. I'm sorry

687
00:58:49,186 --> 00:58:50,219
It's fine

688
00:58:55,459 --> 00:58:57,959
I have to go to Chicago tomorrow

689
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,195
For how long?

690
00:59:01,198 --> 00:59:03,225
Not long. Probably
just a night

691
00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:04,995
What time's your flight?

692
00:59:05,303 --> 00:59:06,901
8:00

693
00:59:08,139 --> 00:59:09,737
A. M.

694
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,009
Diane Dryer's son is
marrying Amy Lynne's daughter

695
00:59:16,046 --> 00:59:18,273
I'm never getting married

696
00:59:18,682 --> 00:59:19,677
Why not?

697
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:21,811
I hate giris

698
00:59:24,088 --> 00:59:26,112
Well, you might change your mind

699
00:59:26,123 --> 00:59:28,021
That happens sometimes

700
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,592
I won't

701
00:59:34,298 --> 00:59:35,197
What?

702
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:38,232
I fired Bill Stone today

703
00:59:38,935 --> 00:59:40,731
So that's what's
bothering you

704
00:59:40,766 --> 00:59:42,633
Nothing's bothering me

705
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,631
Why did you fire him?

706
00:59:46,644 --> 00:59:47,975
He's not accountable

707
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,547
What's accountable?

708
00:59:50,648 --> 00:59:52,946
Is it, like, people who eat people?

709
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:56,383
No, no... that's a cannibal

710
00:59:58,922 --> 01:00:01,713
Anyway, I can't
trust him anymore

711
01:00:02,493 --> 01:00:04,961
So if you run into
Dolly, you'll know

712
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:23,669
<i>Well, how are you gonna clean up the
area so pedestrians can get through?</i>

713
01:01:41,525 --> 01:01:42,686
<i>What?!</i>

714
01:01:43,093 --> 01:01:44,488
<i>I can't believe you!</i>

715
01:01:45,095 --> 01:01:46,727
<i>What are you doing?</i>

716
01:02:13,323 --> 01:02:14,586
Shit!

717
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:15,587
Charlie...!

718
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:18,188
Shit!

719
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:34,500
Come on!

720
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:58,597
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry

721
01:02:58,702 --> 01:02:59,999
I', sorry

722
01:03:00,104 --> 01:03:01,696
Honey, are you ok?

723
01:03:01,805 --> 01:03:03,734
You must have been so worried, huh?

724
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:05,022
- Stop, Mom
- What?

725
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:06,804
- People can we see
- Ok

726
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:31,534
<i>Hi, this is Paul Martel</i>

727
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:33,432
<i>Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks</i>

728
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:34,629
Mom?

729
01:03:34,738 --> 01:03:36,538
Honey...

730
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:39,106
You're supposed to be in bed

731
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:41,439
You're crying, Mom

732
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:43,243
Oh, honey...

733
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:46,439
mommy's just a little sad,
that's all

734
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,778
Come on, I'll take you to bed

735
01:03:49,053 --> 01:03:51,078
Let's get you into bed

736
01:03:51,188 --> 01:03:52,553
Don't be sad, Mom

737
01:03:52,856 --> 01:03:54,817
Dad will be home tomorrow

738
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,135
His name is Paul Martel

739
01:04:11,175 --> 01:04:14,634
He lives at 433 Mercer Street,
apartment 3

740
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:17,669
She sees him during the day

741
01:04:19,049 --> 01:04:21,074
Usually goes around lunchtime

742
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:24,416
Stays about 2 hours,maybe 3

743
01:04:37,835 --> 01:04:40,201
They go to the movies?

744
01:04:40,804 --> 01:04:43,536
They did that day. Otherwise,
they're in his apartment

745
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,942
Pick up!

746
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:23,136
Hey. Hey, lady!

747
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,599
Forgot your keys

748
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,017
Wait!

749
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:11,744
Who is she?! Who is she?!

750
01:07:12,055 --> 01:07:12,722
No!

751
01:07:12,823 --> 01:07:13,721
Calm down!

752
01:07:14,992 --> 01:07:16,290
Why are you doing this?

753
01:07:19,563 --> 01:07:21,958
How many are there?
5? 10?

754
01:07:23,766 --> 01:07:25,528
God, what am I?

755
01:07:25,636 --> 01:07:27,834
The Monday one. What,
did I get my day wrong?

756
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:30,064
She's just a friend, ok?

757
01:07:30,174 --> 01:07:31,664
Just a friend

758
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,673
You're a fuckin' liar

759
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:37,172
Me? I'm the liar?

760
01:07:37,281 --> 01:07:39,078
I can't do this anymore

761
01:07:42,352 --> 01:07:44,452
Fine. Go back to
your suburban carpool

762
01:07:44,454 --> 01:07:45,685
Your tennis dress on your...

763
01:07:45,789 --> 01:07:47,780
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

764
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:49,753
Fuck you!

765
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,588
That'll make you happy

766
01:07:51,595 --> 01:07:53,060
Fuck you!

767
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:00,869
No

768
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:02,632
No, I can't

769
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:04,707
Paul, it's over

770
01:08:07,377 --> 01:08:08,444
I can't!

771
01:08:15,118 --> 01:08:17,213
I hate you. I hate you

772
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:17,818
I know

773
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:19,952
Stop it. I can't

774
01:08:40,544 --> 01:08:42,043
You gonna fuck me?

775
01:08:42,045 --> 01:08:43,103
- Huh?
- You want it?

776
01:08:43,213 --> 01:08:44,339
Yeah, I want you to

777
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:45,380
Say it

778
01:08:45,482 --> 01:08:46,881
- I want you to fuck me
- Say it

779
01:08:46,984 --> 01:08:48,815
I want you to fuck me

780
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:42,764
Oh, thank you

781
01:10:42,866 --> 01:10:44,197
Thank you very much

782
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:46,599
Thank you very much, indeed

783
01:11:08,157 --> 01:11:09,186
Yes?

784
01:11:11,394 --> 01:11:12,493
You're Paul Martel?

785
01:11:12,528 --> 01:11:13,791
Yes

786
01:11:14,798 --> 01:11:16,222
How old are you?

787
01:11:19,302 --> 01:11:20,500
Who are you?

788
01:11:21,503 --> 01:11:23,128
Edward Sumner

789
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:27,072
Connie's husband

790
01:11:33,817 --> 01:11:35,710
May I...

791
01:11:36,019 --> 01:11:37,443
may I come in?

792
01:11:39,389 --> 01:11:41,619
Yeah. Sure

793
01:12:10,153 --> 01:12:11,947
Would you like a drink?

794
01:12:12,155 --> 01:12:13,923
Yeah. Why not?

795
01:12:24,768 --> 01:12:28,501
I have scotch,
vodka... prune juice

796
01:12:28,736 --> 01:12:30,599
Uh... vodka

797
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:33,602
Is it cold?

798
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:36,003
Yeah

799
01:12:37,514 --> 01:12:39,641
I keep it in the freezer

800
01:12:39,749 --> 01:12:42,748
So do I. At home

801
01:13:00,137 --> 01:13:02,799
So tell me, how did you...

802
01:13:02,906 --> 01:13:04,498
...meet my wife?

803
01:13:06,109 --> 01:13:07,973
By accident

804
01:13:08,378 --> 01:13:10,103
On the street

805
01:13:10,514 --> 01:13:13,043
There was a wind storm,
she hooked her knee...

806
01:13:13,078 --> 01:13:15,183
Oh... you're him

807
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:17,945
She told you about that?

808
01:13:17,954 --> 01:13:19,082
Yes

809
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:26,259
How's it going?

810
01:13:28,932 --> 01:13:29,890
Fine

811
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,300
Fine. I mean, ok

812
01:13:32,635 --> 01:13:34,962
This is... this is where you meet?

813
01:13:34,971 --> 01:13:36,363
Yes

814
01:13:37,374 --> 01:13:38,832
She likes it?

815
01:13:38,842 --> 01:13:41,203
Well, I guess.
She never complained

816
01:13:44,814 --> 01:13:48,473
Do you stay in all the time,
or do you go out, too?

817
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:52,784
It depends. Sometimes,
yes, we go out

818
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:54,389
She likes that?

819
01:13:54,424 --> 01:13:55,757
She...

820
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:58,584
...likes this neighborhood?

821
01:13:58,619 --> 01:13:59,923
Oh, yeah

822
01:13:59,929 --> 01:14:02,429
More exciting than
the suburbs, I guess

823
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:10,599
Do you know that we have
been married 11 years?

824
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:13,241
We have a son

825
01:14:14,978 --> 01:14:16,905
Yeah, she told me

826
01:14:19,816 --> 01:14:21,076
More?

827
01:14:21,984 --> 01:14:23,579
Yes, please

828
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,362
He's the reason
that we left the city

829
01:14:40,069 --> 01:14:43,068
Connie thought it
would be better for him

830
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,198
Oh. She told me it was your idea

831
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:51,241
You... talk about me?

832
01:15:10,467 --> 01:15:12,129
Lot of books...

833
01:15:12,435 --> 01:15:15,364
Yeah. Lot of buying and selling

834
01:15:55,712 --> 01:15:57,743
Didn't know it did that

835
01:16:03,818 --> 01:16:05,416
Where did you get this?

836
01:16:05,621 --> 01:16:06,918
It was a gift

837
01:16:07,523 --> 01:16:08,915
From her

838
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:24,102
Why would she do that?

839
01:16:24,137 --> 01:16:25,771
I don't know...

840
01:16:26,676 --> 01:16:30,377
Maybe... maybe she just
wanted to buy me something

841
01:16:34,651 --> 01:16:37,779
She didn't buy this for you.
I gave it to her

842
01:16:45,895 --> 01:16:47,184
I gave it to her...

843
01:16:47,496 --> 01:16:48,793
What?

844
01:16:50,466 --> 01:16:51,895
I gave it to her

845
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:54,561
I gave... I'm s...

846
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,742
I'm feeling sick. I can't...

847
01:17:00,844 --> 01:17:02,541
You want some water?

848
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:07,073
I'm feeling sick.
I'm...

849
01:17:07,783 --> 01:17:09,146
I don't...

850
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:15,522
I'm... I'm not well

851
01:17:15,925 --> 01:17:17,551
I'm not feeling well

852
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:24,531
I'm not...

853
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:26,692
I'm not feeling...

854
01:18:24,927 --> 01:18:26,427

Mm-hmm

- Great

It looks like I nailed you

911
01:28:24,927 --> 01:28:27,225
It's all right, Jerry. It's ok

912
01:28:33,302 --> 01:28:35,668
You'd better check to
see if this is gonna open

913
01:28:35,771 --> 01:28:37,171
No, no, this is... this is fine

914
01:28:37,206 --> 01:28:39,865
It's nothing.
It's nothing. It's fine

915
01:28:44,078 --> 01:28:45,579
Did he dent you, Dad?

916
01:28:46,081 --> 01:28:48,473
Yeah. Yes, he did. Yes, he did

917
01:28:48,584 --> 01:28:50,949
Can we call
the cops, Dad?

918

You sure you don't
wanna check the trunk?

919

- We'll deal with it tomorrow
- It'll just take a second

01:28:56,725 --> 01:28:57,723
No!

tell me what's wrong

What?

925
01:32:15,257 --> 01:32:16,815
His shoes!

926
01:32:17,325 --> 01:32:19,393
They're different colors

927
01:32:26,902 --> 01:32:28,560
Honey, you look awful

928
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,802
What happened last night?
Did you sleep?

929
01:32:30,806 --> 01:32:33,165
I got up and looked for you

930
01:32:33,175 --> 01:32:35,303
Oh, I just, um...

931
01:32:36,611 --> 01:32:38,574
got some air

932
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,344
Are you ok?

933
01:32:41,549 --> 01:32:43,183
Yeah

934
01:32:54,897 --> 01:32:57,188
Do you like it here, Connie?

935
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:58,596
What?

936
01:32:59,597 --> 01:33:00,868
Of course I like it here

937
01:33:00,903 --> 01:33:02,134
'Cause we don't have to stay here

938
01:33:02,137 --> 01:33:04,632
We can... we can
move back to the city

939
01:33:06,141 --> 01:33:09,201
Honey, what has gotten into you?

940
01:33:11,246 --> 01:33:12,844
Are you ok?

941
01:33:13,547 --> 01:33:16,114
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine

942
01:33:18,787 --> 01:33:20,245
Are you ok?

943
01:33:20,355 --> 01:33:22,549
I'm fine

944
01:33:23,058 --> 01:33:26,789
Everybody's fine, and
we're not moving anywhere

945
01:34:09,171 --> 01:34:11,098
The cops are here, Mom

946
01:34:12,674 --> 01:34:14,141
What do they want?

947
01:34:14,143 --> 01:34:16,108
I'm sure it's nothing

948
01:34:22,918 --> 01:34:25,118
N.Y.P.D., Mom

949
01:34:26,889 --> 01:34:27,787
Hello

950
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:29,050
- Mrs. Sumner
- Yes

951
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:30,520
Yeah, I'm detective Dean

952
01:34:30,526 --> 01:34:32,016
This is detective Mirojnick...

953
01:34:32,127 --> 01:34:33,592
...New York City
Police Department

954
01:34:33,595 --> 01:34:34,887
Did something happen?
Is something wrong?

955
01:34:34,897 --> 01:34:36,225
Oh, no, no. No. Uh...

956
01:34:36,231 --> 01:34:38,429
do you know a Paul Martel?

957
01:34:39,034 --> 01:34:42,868
Yes, um... not very well. Why?

958
01:34:42,971 --> 01:34:44,529
Do you know where he is?

959
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:47,843
No. Um...

960
01:34:50,245 --> 01:34:52,444
At home, I would imagine

961
01:34:52,647 --> 01:34:54,210
Do you know
where he lives?

962
01:34:54,515 --> 01:34:56,710
Soho, isn't it?

963
01:34:57,619 --> 01:35:00,788
Your name and number
were found on his desk

964
01:35:02,791 --> 01:35:04,315
Has he done
something wrong?

965
01:35:04,326 --> 01:35:07,658
Well, we don't know. He's been
reported missing by his family

966
01:35:07,896 --> 01:35:09,595
His wife doesn't know where he is

967
01:35:13,469 --> 01:35:15,302
I didn't know
he was married

968
01:35:16,471 --> 01:35:17,968
Separated

969
01:35:22,678 --> 01:35:24,338
When did you see him last?

970
01:35:26,546 --> 01:35:29,183
I don't know... It's hard to say

971
01:35:29,584 --> 01:35:30,781
Um...

972
01:35:31,386 --> 01:35:33,150
he's a book dealer. I...

973
01:35:33,255 --> 01:35:36,413
I barely know him at all. I was
going to buy some books from him

974
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:37,385
And did you?

975
01:35:37,493 --> 01:35:39,989
No, not yet

976
01:35:42,998 --> 01:35:45,924
Has something happened to him?
I mean, do you think he's all right?

977
01:35:45,959 --> 01:35:47,934
It's hard to say at this point

978
01:35:49,036 --> 01:35:50,431
We're workin' on it

979
01:35:52,241 --> 01:35:54,638
Anyway, thanks, uh...
thanks for your time

980
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:56,235
Thank you

981
01:35:56,345 --> 01:35:59,211
I like these snow glass things

982
01:35:59,214 --> 01:36:00,475
My boy has some of these

983
01:36:00,582 --> 01:36:02,782
If you hear from Mr. Martel,
let us know

984
01:36:02,784 --> 01:36:04,142
Certainly

985
01:36:31,946 --> 01:36:34,615
Dad! The cops came
to our house today

986
01:36:36,718 --> 01:36:38,981
Cops? What did they want?

987
01:36:43,325 --> 01:36:47,391
Someone's missing... and they
have to check everyone, you know

988
01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:53,333
Who was it?

989
01:36:54,335 --> 01:36:56,096
Honey, sit up straight

990
01:36:59,307 --> 01:37:00,369
Who was it?

991
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:01,472
I don't think
you know him

992
01:37:01,577 --> 01:37:04,171
He's, uh... he sells books

993
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,946
I forget where I met him

994
01:37:08,049 --> 01:37:09,980
Was it a bad guy, Mom?

995
01:37:12,453 --> 01:37:15,611
So what did they, uh... why
did they wanna talk to you?

996
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:19,350
I guess... he had my name and number

997
01:37:20,661 --> 01:37:22,957
Why... why would
he have your number?

998
01:37:24,632 --> 01:37:26,627
I think I bought a book from him

999
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,511
Be careful. Be careful

1000
01:37:40,515 --> 01:37:41,613
Hey, Charlie

1001
01:37:42,351 --> 01:37:43,579
Hi, darlin'

1002
01:37:43,685 --> 01:37:45,848
Oh, I wish you lived closer

1003
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:54,215
<i>Lord, bless this food to our
use and us to thy service...</i>

1004
01:37:54,663 --> 01:37:58,690

mindful of the needs of others</i>

1005

01:37:59,301 --> 01:38:01,667

1007
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:03,863
<i>Edward!</i>

1008
01:38:13,715 --> 01:38:15,245
<i>All right!</i>

1009
01:38:23,792 --> 01:38:26,282
I have a... I have a story
you don't know about Edward

1010
01:38:26,395 --> 01:38:27,885
<i>He was at the club...</i>

1011
01:39:15,743 --> 01:39:17,575
Hello, Mrs. Sumner

1012
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,211
Sorry to bother you on the weekend

1013
01:39:20,315 --> 01:39:22,204
- I'm, uh... detective Dean
- Oh

1014
01:39:22,284 --> 01:39:24,074
This is detective Mirojnick, N.Y.P.D.

1015
01:39:24,085 --> 01:39:24,783
Ok

1016
01:39:24,886 --> 01:39:27,475
We were hoping to talk
to you for a few minutes

1017
01:39:27,656 --> 01:39:29,786
Uh, sure

1018
01:39:29,891 --> 01:39:32,050
Charlie, we're gonna go up
on the porch for a minute

1019
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:32,958
Can I come?

1020
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:35,019
No, sweetheart.
You stay out here

1021
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:37,064
Play with Poppy.
We'll be right back

1022
01:39:38,467 --> 01:39:39,929
I don't know if
your wife mentioned

1023
01:39:39,935 --> 01:39:42,064
we was here about a
week and a half ago...

1024
01:39:42,165 --> 01:39:43,694
about Paul Martel

1025
01:39:43,805 --> 01:39:46,105
Yeah, that was the...
the man who was missing

1026
01:39:46,107 --> 01:39:48,341
Well, he's not missing anymore

1027
01:39:48,476 --> 01:39:51,235
His body was discovered last weekend

1028
01:39:52,145 --> 01:39:54,640
God, that's... that's terrible

1029
01:39:56,551 --> 01:39:58,185
Oh, my God

1030
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:02,587
Do you recall where you met
Mr. Martel, Mrs. Sumner?

1031
01:40:03,592 --> 01:40:06,250
- I told you
- Uh, no, ma'am, you didn't

1032
01:40:06,394 --> 01:40:08,309
I'm sorry, um...

1033
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:10,624
I can't remember

1034
01:40:11,133 --> 01:40:13,081
A fund-raiser, I think

1035
01:40:13,116 --> 01:40:14,729
Can you be more specific?

1036
01:40:15,036 --> 01:40:16,703
Juilliard

1037
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:20,068
Juilliard

1038
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:21,742
The music school

1039
01:40:22,477 --> 01:40:24,507
Yes, I know what Juilliard is

1040
01:40:24,512 --> 01:40:26,642
Oh, of course you do.
I'm sorry

1041
01:40:26,648 --> 01:40:28,679
Were you there, too, sir?

1042
01:40:30,285 --> 01:40:32,648
Yes, yes... I think I was

1043
01:40:33,054 --> 01:40:35,681
Well, maybe you met Mr. Martel

1044
01:40:37,391 --> 01:40:39,527
No, no, not that I remember

1045
01:40:39,562 --> 01:40:41,158
Maybe you'd recognize him

1046
01:40:42,631 --> 01:40:45,197
No, no. I never met him before

1047
01:40:45,232 --> 01:40:47,764
- Is that him?
- Yes, yes

1048
01:40:48,736 --> 01:40:50,770
You ever been
to his apartment?

1049
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:52,965
No

1050
01:40:53,074 --> 01:40:55,074
No, I... I... I hardly knew him

1051
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:57,407
I didn't even know why
he had my phone number

1052
01:40:57,412 --> 01:40:58,772
Maybe he liked you

1053
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,648
Look, I think that's enough

1054
01:41:04,152 --> 01:41:06,167
So you've never been
to his apartment

1055
01:41:06,202 --> 01:41:09,483
Well, how 'bout, the neighborhood.
Did you hang out down there?

1056
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:12,257
- No
- No, not often...

1057
01:41:12,258 --> 01:41:15,088
- ...or no, never
- Never

1058
01:41:15,163 --> 01:41:17,561
I can't remember the
last time I was in Soho

1059
01:41:17,565 --> 01:41:19,758
It was 4 weeks ago, actually

1060
01:41:22,203 --> 01:41:24,968
You got a parking ticket right
in front of Martel's apartment...

1061
01:41:24,971 --> 01:41:26,298
...4 weeks ago

1062
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:28,507
Oh, that. Right

1063
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:32,073
I... had coffee with
friends at a little place

1064
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,079
I forgot

1065
01:41:33,114 --> 01:41:36,446
- It was Tracy and Sally
- Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah

1066
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:49,789
Look...

1067
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:55,293
my wife has told you everything
she knows. So have I. So...

1068
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:58,768
...if you don't mind, we'd
like to get back to our son

1069
01:41:58,803 --> 01:42:01,001
All right. Uh...

1070
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:03,474
why don't I give you my card...

1071
01:42:03,509 --> 01:42:05,042
I have your card

1072
01:42:06,447 --> 01:42:07,610
Right

1073
01:42:09,084 --> 01:42:11,314
- Enjoy your weekend
- You, too

1074
01:43:07,208 --> 01:43:08,966
Sumner, please

1075
01:43:47,915 --> 01:43:49,674
Oh, my God

1076
01:43:51,319 --> 01:43:53,212
Hi, Connie

1077
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:55,785
Hi, Tracy

1078
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:59,155
I'm just picking up my
silk suit for tonight

1079
01:44:01,129 --> 01:44:03,522
I was thinking of wearing the black

1080
01:44:15,877 --> 01:44:17,606
I'm gonna give up the good row

1081
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:20,538
Let someone else be
gorgeous for a change

1082
01:44:24,519 --> 01:44:28,017
So what should we bring aside
from our sparkling personalities?

1083
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:33,819
How we doing?

1084
01:44:34,228 --> 01:44:35,452
Fine

1085
01:44:35,563 --> 01:44:36,652
You need help?

1086
01:44:36,664 --> 01:44:38,056
No

1087
01:44:40,235 --> 01:44:44,430
The white is not cold, so I'm
gonna put it in the freezer

1088
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:48,404
Just remind me it's
in there, all right?

1089
01:44:50,745 --> 01:44:52,736
Most people drink red anyway

1090
01:44:57,818 --> 01:44:59,186
Oh, I love these things

1091
01:44:59,287 --> 01:45:01,182
Is there anyplace
you guys haven't been?

1092
01:45:01,189 --> 01:45:04,922
Mmm, the Rosenthals
got 795 for their place

1093
01:45:05,026 --> 01:45:06,525
In 2 days, they had 6 offers

1094
01:45:06,528 --> 01:45:08,461
Sealed bids. That's
what everyone's doing now

1095
01:45:08,496 --> 01:45:10,395
What do you think
this place is worth, Ed?

1096
01:45:10,898 --> 01:45:12,892
Oh, I don't know

1097
01:45:13,001 --> 01:45:15,198
You sell your house,
where do you go?

1098
01:45:15,233 --> 01:45:16,966
At those prices, Tahiti

1099
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:18,295
Bangkok

1100
01:45:18,406 --> 01:45:20,767
Connie, where's
this one from?

1101
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:33,046
Fiji

1102
01:45:33,655 --> 01:45:36,186
<i>Oh, remember, Jeff, I asked
you to take me to Fiji?</i>

1103
01:45:36,191 --> 01:45:36,989
<i>Mmm</i>

1104
01:45:37,092 --> 01:45:38,389
<i>And then you took me to Hawaii?</i>

1105
01:45:38,493 --> 01:45:40,461
<i>We went fishing every single day...</i>

1106
01:46:04,486 --> 01:46:06,249
What happened, Edward?

1107
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:11,157
What did you do?

1108
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:14,184
Did you hurt him?

1109
01:46:15,595 --> 01:46:17,156
Huh?

1110
01:46:18,666 --> 01:46:20,096
Edward?

1111
01:46:21,401 --> 01:46:23,099
Did you hurt him?

1112
01:46:25,773 --> 01:46:27,365
You did, didn't you?

1113
01:46:28,275 --> 01:46:31,842
Oh, Jesus, Edward

1114
01:46:33,547 --> 01:46:35,414
Talk to me

1115
01:46:35,817 --> 01:46:38,217
Tell me what you did

1116
01:46:38,252 --> 01:46:41,812
No, you tell me what you did

1117
01:46:42,323 --> 01:46:45,317
How you fucked him over
and over and over...

1118
01:46:45,426 --> 01:46:47,155
You lied to me...

1119
01:46:47,262 --> 01:46:49,996
over and over and over...

1120
01:46:49,997 --> 01:46:51,291
Edward, please...

1121
01:46:51,299 --> 01:46:53,624
No, you don't talk to me now

1122
01:46:53,634 --> 01:46:55,965
I gave everything...

1123
01:46:56,771 --> 01:46:59,169
...for this family

1124
01:46:59,474 --> 01:47:00,934
Everything...

1125
01:47:02,142 --> 01:47:05,011
Snd what did you do?

1126
01:47:05,713 --> 01:47:07,647
You threw it all away...

1127
01:47:07,749 --> 01:47:09,580
...like it was nothing

1128
01:47:09,584 --> 01:47:11,580
For what?

1129
01:47:11,986 --> 01:47:14,117
To a fucking kid!

1130
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:24,755
You didn't think I'd know?

1131
01:47:25,066 --> 01:47:26,566
I wouldn't feel it?

1132
01:47:26,601 --> 01:47:28,892
I knew it from
the very first day

1133
01:47:31,172 --> 01:47:33,072
Because I know you, Connie

1134
01:47:33,107 --> 01:47:35,767
I know you, and I fuckin' hate you!

1135
01:47:35,777 --> 01:47:38,935
I didn't want to kill him.
I wanted to kill you!

1136
01:47:41,516 --> 01:47:44,177
Oh, my God

1137
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,685
Edward... Oh, my God

1138

Dear God

1139
01:48:51,486 --> 01:48:55,117
Mom, look what I did

1140
01:48:57,294 --> 01:48:59,685
Honey... that's ok

1141
01:49:00,686 --> 01:49:01,786
That's ok

1142
01:49:02,196 --> 01:49:03,879
I'm sorry, Mom

1143
01:49:03,914 --> 01:49:05,562
It's an accident

1144
01:49:05,967 --> 01:49:07,800
Everybody has accidents

1145
01:49:07,835 --> 01:49:10,396
Why aren't you
in bed, Mom?

1146

I don't know

1147
01:49:18,546 --> 01:49:20,377
Charlie, look at me

1148
01:49:20,981 --> 01:49:22,744
I want you to know...

1149

and clean it off, no?"</i>

1160
01:53:06,874 --> 01:53:11,175
<i>"Come on! I'm not an
ax murderer. I promise"</i>

1161
01:53:45,877 --> 01:53:47,139
<i>"Thank you"</i>

1162
01:54:14,041 --> 01:54:16,373
What are we gonna do?

1163
01:54:19,547 --> 01:54:21,614
I'm so scared

1164
01:54:23,817 --> 01:54:25,917
I'll turn myself in

1165
01:54:26,219 --> 01:54:27,578
No

1166
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,981
No

1167
01:54:41,168 --> 01:54:43,766
No, we can get through this

1168
01:54:45,272 --> 01:54:48,240
We'll take it one day at a time

1169
01:54:49,744 --> 01:54:51,880
No one will know

1170
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:55,580
We'll know

1171
01:55:03,891 --> 01:55:07,452
31, 3.500, 3.800, 4.000...

1172
01:55:07,561 --> 01:55:09,654
42, 45, 4.800...

1173
01:56:36,684 --> 01:56:38,818
We could disappear

1174
01:56:41,021 --> 01:56:43,613
We could raise some
money, sell everything...

1175
01:56:43,724 --> 01:56:46,022
and just leave the country

1176
01:56:47,227 --> 01:56:49,062
<i>"Señorita"</i>

1177
01:56:50,163 --> 01:56:52,155
Mexico

1178
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:55,329
Why not?

1179
01:56:57,136 --> 01:56:59,335
We could get a little
house on the beach...

1180
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:02,037
Take a different name...

1181
01:57:03,244 --> 01:57:05,609
People do it all the time

1182
01:57:06,312 --> 01:57:08,281
What do we tell Charlie?

1183
01:57:10,083 --> 01:57:13,085
Tell him it's an adventure

1184
01:57:15,987 --> 01:57:18,180
We could fish all day

1185
01:57:21,762 --> 01:57:24,788
We could learn to play the guitar...

1186
01:57:26,199 --> 01:57:30,865
And I would serenade
you to sleep every night

1187
01:57:31,771 --> 01:57:34,706
We'd just live the rest of
our lives on that beach...

1188
01:57:35,609 --> 01:57:39,568
...and then when we die, we
could just push out to sea

1189
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,504
What do you think?

1190
01:57:43,684 --> 01:57:45,549
It sounds perfect

1191
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:23,150
POLICE
