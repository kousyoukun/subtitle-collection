1
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:05,890
Tell me when you're gonna come.

2
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:21,712
-Are you coming? You're coming?
-Yeah.

3
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:53,604
Hello.

4
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,573
Hey, bro, what's up?

5
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,450
I'm crashed out.

6
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:07,924
What are you doing?

7
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:13,028
What party?
What are you talking about?

8
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,560
Are you fucking kidding me?

9
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:21,229
Are you fucking kidding me?

10
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,205
Where?

11
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,471
Fuck!

12
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:31,475
Fuck!

13
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:35,483
The number you have reached has
been disconnected, if you feel you--

14
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:39,455
No fucking way!

15
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,850
Where's the phone? Payphone.

16
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:26,520
Straight to the back,
past the bathrooms, on the left.

17
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:35,969
Hey, Mallory.

18
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,574
Oh, hey, Syd, what's up?

19
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,080
You gonna go
to Becca's thing tonight?

20
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:54,089
Yeah, you know, I was gonna go
and say goodbye.

21
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,518
Why, you going?

22
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,926
Yeah, I think so.
Thinking about it. Yeah.

23
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:03,027
So you still talk to London?

24
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:07,103
Yeah, you know,
here and there. Why?

25
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:11,208
Oh, you know, I was just a little
surprised to hear she was moving.

26
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:15,811
Did she get a place out there?
Is she staying with somebody?

27
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:18,881
She didn't tell you where
she was staying? Come on, Mal.

28
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,076
I mean, she said something
about moving in with her boyfriend...

29
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:25,849
...or something, but, I mean,
that's pretty much all I know.

30
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,453
-Can I get you a drink?
-Yeah.

31
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:30,993
Can I have a vodka? A large one.

32
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:33,221
Naked, please.

33
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:42,332
Excuse me. One second here.

34
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:45,775
Here you go.

35
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:49,345
Thanks. Hey, look, I didn't--
I didn't mean to be rude.

36
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:51,642
It's okay.

37
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:56,186
-Hey, Syd, I gotta go cash out, so....
-Yeah.

38
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:58,185
-See you tonight.
-Yeah.

39
00:06:58,356 --> 00:07:02,315
Listen, I'm gonna get a bit of sniff,
so if you want some, just let me know.

40
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:04,621
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

41
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:06,127
How much is it?

42
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:07,959
Oh, no, don't worry. Just find me.

43
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:10,795
Don't tell London.
You know she hates that shit.

44
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,437
Yeah, like I'm gonna say something.

45
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:17,063
-All right, well, see you later.
-Yeah, I'll see you.

46
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:30,684
Your name wouldn't happen
to be Bateman, would it?

47
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:35,192
-Unfortunately, yes.
-Hey. Syd.

48
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,453
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming down.

49
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,723
I know you don't deliver this far down.
I just had a shitty day.

50
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,958
I have to clear my head out.

51
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:44,795
No worries, mate.

52
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:46,960
So where do you wanna do this?

53
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:50,708
We don't want to go in the bathroom.
It's horrendous in there.

54
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,105
I drove. You wanna use my car?

55
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:56,340
Your car? Why not?

56
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:06,820
So how is this shit? It's pretty good?

57
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,756
Can't say I've sampled
any of this batch...

58
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:13,830
...but considering the source,
I imagine it to be pretty clean, yeah.

59
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:20,070
So is this like a full-time gig for you?
A full-time job?

60
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,229
No, mate, I'm a banker.

61
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,705
Foreign exchange dealer.
Currency trader.

62
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:28,277
-Currency trader?
-Euros, pounds, arbitrage, yeah.

63
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,175
Okay, so you're not a dealer.

64
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:33,112
Mate, I ain't a fucking dealer.

65
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:35,276
Strictly a buyer.

66
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:37,944
I was uptown, you were on my way.
It's just a favor.

67
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:42,388
Gotcha. Well, whatever it is,
I really appreciate it, man.

68
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:49,059
Here we go.

69
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:51,031
So a currency trader, huh?

70
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:53,193
How's the money in that, good?

71
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:55,737
Not if you get stuck on this shit, no.

72
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:58,808
Yeah, I know.
God, what a stupid fucking drug.

73
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,707
I don't know what you're doing after
this, if you got plans or anything...

74
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:07,545
...but a friend is having a party two
blocks from here, if you're interested.

75
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,244
No, thanks, mate,
but I've had a shit day, believe me.

76
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:13,050
I just figured, you know,
you came down this whole way.

77
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:15,089
It'll probably be pretty good.

78
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,592
What kind of party is it, exactly?

79
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:19,389
Actually, it's a....

80
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:25,093
It's a going-away party for this girl,
for my ex-chick.

81
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,434
But it'll be good, you know,
free booze, free food, hot chicks.

82
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:32,667
I really shouldn't. Thanks anyway.
I appreciate the offer.

83
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,812
Fuck it, Syd. I'm gonna go.
Take it easy.

84
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:44,352
Why are you gonna go?
Don't go. You just got here.

85
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:46,615
You walked all the way down here.
Why leave?

86
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,451
Because I've had a horrendous day.

87
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:52,426
I've decided not to go because I don't
want to meet a loft full of strangers.

88
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:54,996
-You enjoy yourself.
-Come in for five minutes.

89
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,157
-Get a drink.
-No, man. You go, fuck it.

90
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:59,325
What do you got
that's better than this?

91
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:01,471
Girls, free booze, do a line.

92
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,540
I've just come out of the most
psychotic therapy session...

93
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:07,973
...I've had in fucking years.
Almost smacked some cunt for a taxi.

94
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:10,511
I really don't know
if I'm ready for this shit.

95
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:14,276
Just come in for five minutes.
You don't like it, you can leave.

96
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:16,180
One fucking drink, bro.

97
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:18,480
Mallory will be here.

98
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,120
One drink?

99
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,122
One fucking drink.

100
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,958
-How you doing, man?
-Evening.

101
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:32,295
-What is it, 501 1?
-Yes.

102
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:34,130
Thanks, man.

103
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,733
-Hey, Maya.
-Hi, Syd.

104
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:41,173
-How you doing?
-Good.

105
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:44,508
-It's been a while.
-Yeah. How you doing?

106
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,707
I'm good.
Bateman, this is Maya. Sorry.

107
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:48,875
-Maya, Bateman.
-Nice to meet you.

108
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:51,180
How you been?
What you been up to?

109
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:57,291
In hell, man. I fucked up on the SATs,
I gotta retake them.

110
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,388
-That's it, you know?
-Right.

111
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:03,533
Just wanna kill myself. Yeah.

112
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:17,273
Well, you know, if you want to get out
of SAT mode, I picked up a lot of:

113
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:20,349
-You know, so....
-Are you dealing now?

114
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:25,181
Yes, I'm dealing. No, I'm not dealing.
I got more than I need, so if you're....

115
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,517
-All right, man, thanks.
-Just come find me.

116
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:32,185
-I might take you up on that.
-Did anybody--?

117
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,764
Coming.

118
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:46,732
-Hello.
-Hello.

119
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,571
-Hey, baby.
-How are you?

120
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:51,873
-I'm good. Hey, Syd, how are you?
-This, my darling, is for you.

121
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:54,642
Oh, you guys, shut up. Thank you.

122
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:58,082
-You know you are the best.
-Nobody's here yet.

123
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:00,314
Grab a drink.
Make yourself at home.

124
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,617
Hello? Syd and London.

125
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:05,989
-Don't disrespect them in public.
-ln public.

126
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:07,754
Let's go upstairs.

127
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:11,298
Why? Who's upstairs?

128
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:14,732
Very bad. Catch me.

129
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:39,188
You're crazy.

130
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,628
What is this?

131
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:47,167
It's for you.

132
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:52,408
-For me? For me?
-For you.

133
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,379
Oh, my God, Syd, I love it.

134
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:03,416
Thank you.

135
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:11,524
I love you.

136
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:17,558
I love you.

137
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:25,975
Come on, "l love you too, London,"
you fucker.

138
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:28,133
You can say it.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

139
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,142
-London, don't.
-What? What am I doing?

140
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:31,974
-This.
-What am I doing wrong?

141
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:35,914
Whatever this is, this obsession
to put a verbal label on everything.

142
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:38,919
-It's not about words.
-No, it is about words.

143
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:42,081
Because if we didn't have words,
we'd be living in caves...

144
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:44,385
-...and still talking with our hands.
-Stop.

145
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:46,358
We haven't even
come close to a fight.

146
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:49,555
If we can avoid that first fight,
by theory we'll never fight.

147
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,064
Okay? Please.

148
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:53,361
It's been so perfect till now.
Don't do this.

149
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:56,004
It's been perfect for you. For you.

150
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,970
London.

151
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:08,116
Coming.

152
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:11,015
Wait a minute,
someone's at the door.

153
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:15,183
-Hello.
-Hi.

154
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,350
Wow, you look beautiful.

155
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:19,688
You look hot.
Nice hat, nice boots.

156
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:21,524
Thanks.

157
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:24,633
-Hey.
-Hey, Becca.

158
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,038
-Rebecca.
-Bateman. Friend of Syd's.

159
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:31,299
-Nice to meet you.
-Nobody's here yet, guys.

160
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:33,703
So just come on in
and make yourself at home.

161
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,313
Okay, so you're not gonna believe
who's just fucking shown up.

162
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:45,087
Great party, mate.

163
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:49,157
Oh, it'll be better. It'll be better.
Trust me. I promise you.

164
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:50,953
Okay, I've gotta go.

165
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:56,899
Please tell me
you did not bring Syd here.

166
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,558
Oh, my God, I just rode up
in the elevator with him.

167
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:02,068
-Why? He's not invited?
-He's so not invited.

168
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,836
He's fucking touching
my Buddha's head.

169
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:08,636
Hey, London, it's me.

170
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:12,908
Give me a call as soon
as you get this, okay? Okay, bye.

171
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,317
Fuck it.

172
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:18,977
Hey, Syd. Do us a favor, yeah?
Don't touch the Buddha.

173
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:22,152
Okay?

174
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:25,151
He's a fucking cocksucker.

175
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,024
Where did you get your hat?

176
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:28,789
It's so cute on you.

177
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:39,040
He's fucked.

178
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:43,009
To show up at someone's party.
He isn't even fucking invited.

179
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:58,651
Did they just go upstairs?

180
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:01,263
Right. Nice. Nice of them to ask.

181
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:12,637
Wait, I'm confused, did you say
you do believe in God or you don't?

182
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:17,040
"God" might not be
the appropriate word for it, actually.

183
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:19,538
It's more of an epiphany.

184
00:16:19,716 --> 00:16:21,377
Epiphany?
What was your epiphany?

185
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:24,577
Well, for me, an epiphany
is when you really see the universe...

186
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:26,654
...in all it's splendor and beauty...

187
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:29,053
...and you suddenly
understand everything.

188
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,216
-What does that mean?
-Fucking everything.

189
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:34,727
Everything you can imagine. You don't
know what "everything" means?

190
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:38,095
I know what it means. I don't know
what you mean by "everything."

191
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:41,533
It means everything, doesn't it?
You know, everything.

192
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:44,868
-So, what's your problem?
-For someone who's seen the infinite...

193
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,238
...you're vague. You'd think
with someone who's had a revelation...

194
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:51,278
-...you'd be more specific.
-It's not about specifics.

195
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:54,781
It's an energy that hits you between
the eyes and you're enlightened.

196
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:57,215
-You see everything?
-You don't see everything.

197
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:59,787
You see nothing.
But you understand everything.

198
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,522
And you know what
got me the most?

199
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:06,560
-ls that I understood time horizons.
-What's a time horizon?

200
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:15,298
It's like this. I understood
where I stood in relation...

201
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:18,270
...to where the Romans and the Jews
were 2000 years ago...

202
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:20,409
...and why I was here now.

203
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:22,408
Then I felt this enormous
compassion...

204
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,140
...for the struggle of the human race
and what it had to go through for us.

205
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:29,080
You know, for life as we know it
to come to this point.

206
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:33,416
It's truly remarkable, but at the same
time, it's utterly fucking disturbing.

207
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,616
I mean, we're the same people
that were living in Roman times...

208
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:40,661
...throwing boiling oil on each other
and crucifying Christians.

209
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,230
Not that that's entirely a bad thing.

210
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,230
Hey, Syd, are you in there?
It's Maya.

211
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:47,731
Oh, fuck! Fuck me.

212
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:52,102
-Fuck, fuck. Give me one second.
-What the fuck have you done?

213
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:53,902
-Sorry. Fuck.
-You clumsy bastard.

214
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,812
-What have you fucking done?
-Shit.

215
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:00,414
Look at that.

216
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:02,413
It's covered in fucking beer.

217
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:04,018
-Fuck.
-Oh, my God.

218
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,983
What are you gonna do?

219
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:08,953
-Goddamn it, Syd.
-lnstant karma.

220
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,649
-I got it.
-That's enough to give up blasphemy.

221
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,920
-Get up here.
-No, we can totally save this.

222
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:15,427
What are you gonna do,
eat food off the floor?

223
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:17,122
-Fucking gross.
-Do me a favor.

224
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,497
-God fucking damn it.
-God, is this it?

225
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,297
-Yes.
-Are you kidding?

226
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:25,372
-No, it's my fucking fault too.
-Just snort it off the floor.

227
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,033
You don't wanna do that. I shouldn't
have put it by the fucking sink.

228
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:37,952
What are you doing?

229
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:52,896
-What's that?
-As I said, all is not lost.

230
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:57,233
-Bateman, Jesus Christ.
-Oh, my God, you fucking rock.

231
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:59,237
-Do you know this painting?
-No.

232
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:01,308
It's Van Gogh's
Wheatfield with Crows,

233
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:03,968
The most significant painting
the man's ever painted.

234
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:05,875
-Oh, well, then.
-Fuck, it's true.

235
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:08,714
That'll do for starters, won't it?

236
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:12,514
Look, this is the last painting
the man did before he killed himself.

237
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:16,215
It's his suicide note. He even put
his left ear in the fucking clouds.

238
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:19,327
There is his mutilated left ear.

239
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:22,828
Can you see it? Not everyone sees it,
of course, but there it is.

240
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:25,900
He mutilated his left ear
and put it in the fucking painting.

241
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:27,535
What does that mean?

242
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,541
Maya, I'm curious.
Do you believe in God?

243
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:38,737
You guys have been doing
too many drugs.

244
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:40,883
Answer the question. Yes or no?

245
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:44,586
God, that's a really long
conversation...

246
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:48,349
...but I will tell you something I read
the other day that freaked me out.

247
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:49,957
I don't remember where it was.

248
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,856
It was like Russia or Germany
or one of these places...

249
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,759
...but these scientists,
they took this pregnant rabbit...

250
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:01,061
,,,and they hooked up to,
like, a heart monitor and an EEG,,,

251
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:02,932
...which sensors your brain waves.

252
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:06,563
And, like, the second after she gives
birth, they take these babies...

253
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:10,109
...and they jump in a van
and they start shooting them...

254
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:13,640
...one by one in the back of the head
with, like, a.22 rifle.

255
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,714
From, like one mile away:

256
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:18,217
Five miles away:
Twenty miles away--

257
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:21,083
Don't tell me people are
killing little bunny rabbits.

258
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:23,953
What's so interesting
is that every time they'd shoot...

259
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:26,651
...one of these poor babies
in the back of the head...

260
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:29,990
...the mother's heartbeat
and brain waves would go crazy.

261
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:34,296
So I'm just saying there's,
you know, shit like that, and then--

262
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,768
The mother knew the babies
were getting shot--

263
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:40,238
Yes. Every fucking time. Exactly.

264
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:44,402
I mean, there's all that stuff, you know,
like those weird identical twins, right?

265
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,912
One of the brothers is
walking down the street...

266
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,983
,,,gets stabbed
by some serial killer,

267
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,614
Wait. So he gets stabbed, right?

268
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,420
And then 900 miles away,
at the exact same time...

269
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:02,325
,,,his twin brother falls down,

270
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:04,159
Weird, it's very weird, yes.

271
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,460
Do you want to let me finish
what I'm saying?

272
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:08,865
-Please, please, finish.
-Okay, he falls down.

273
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,506
Gets hospitalized
due to heart palpitations...

274
00:21:11,674 --> 00:21:13,869
...at the same time
his brother was stabbed.

275
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:16,671
-Why are you shaking your head?
-You sound like London.

276
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:19,371
-It's coincidence.
-How is it a coincidence?

277
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:22,346
I've had this conversation before.
I'm not having it here.

278
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:26,648
Well, then, let's not. Then don't
ask me about God, okay, Syd?

279
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,790
Hey, is London here yet?

280
00:21:33,662 --> 00:21:34,993
No, I don't think so.

281
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:36,722
Did you meet her boyfriend?

282
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:39,696
Yeah, a couple of times. He's nice.

283
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:45,736
Is he, like, an attractive guy?
Is he good-looking?

284
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:49,072
Are you asking me
if he's an attractive guy?

285
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:50,912
I guess.

286
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:55,039
You guess?
What do you mean, you guess?

287
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:56,741
I mean, I guess.

288
00:21:56,952 --> 00:22:00,979
All right, so I'm curious. Do you think
he's more or less attractive than me?

289
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:02,988
Syd, I don't know.

290
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:07,018
Well, you do know.
You just aren't telling me.

291
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:11,262
I don't know, Syd. You guys just--
You have totally different looks.

292
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:13,560
All right, yes.
We have very different looks.

293
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:16,102
But whose do you like more?
His or mine?

294
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,973
This is stupid, Syd.

295
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,541
Okay, fine.

296
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:26,237
I guess, on some level,
I find him attractive.

297
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:28,280
That doesn't mean that I find him...

298
00:22:28,484 --> 00:22:30,918
...any more or less attractive
than I find you.

299
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:35,247
Okay?

300
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:38,392
I won't lie to you.
Just because we're going out...

301
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,357
...doesn't mean I'm gonna,
you know...

302
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,862
...suddenly not be attracted
to the opposite sex.

303
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,796
He's a friend
who happens to be attractive.

304
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:51,268
It was one lunch.
Why are you freaking out?

305
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,206
You don't see me going to lunch
with a bunch of attractive people.

306
00:22:55,377 --> 00:23:00,542
Okay. First of all,
it was one guy, not a bunch.

307
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:05,312
And it's really not my problem that
you don't have female friends, is it?

308
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:09,423
Because no one's stopping you
from having female friends.

309
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:14,558
I love this, by the way.

310
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:23,101
-So for the sake of conversation....
-Syd.

311
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:26,241
-Let's just pretend you and l...
-Please, can we just drop it?

312
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:28,569
...don't know each other.
Just listen to me.

313
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:32,510
Let's pretend for five minutes
you don't know me, I don't know you.

314
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,512
Me and what's-his-name
are in the room.

315
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:36,776
-Who do you pick?
-I do know you, Syd.

316
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:38,419
Remove that from the equation.

317
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:40,953
-You can't.
-Gun to your head. Who do you pick?

318
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:44,615
I would pick you.
I would pick you in any equation.

319
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,255
Are you all right in there?

320
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:49,954
Everything is fine. Thank you.

321
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:55,594
Syd, literally, this has got to be one
of the most insane conversations...

322
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:57,568
...I've ever had with you.

323
00:23:58,073 --> 00:24:00,371
I don't want to fuck him. I don't.

324
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:01,975
-Fuck him?
-lt was one lunch.

325
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:03,805
Who said anything
about fucking him?

326
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:07,142
-I didn't say fucking, I said attracted.
-That's what you meant.

327
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:09,181
-It's not.
-Please keep your voice down.

328
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:11,148
I meant attracted, you said fuck.

329
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,982
Can you just fucking
shut the fuck up?

330
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,979
What do you want?

331
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:19,495
I want you to answer
the fucking question.

332
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:28,631
Syd, you're a cute guy. You are.
You really, really are, but I don't know.

333
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:31,638
He has this angular, sexy,
Diesel-ad thing going on.

334
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:33,241
But I don't even know him.

335
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,468
-So maybe he's an asshole.
-You know what?

336
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:38,981
Fuck you, Maya. If you were my friend,
you would've lied.

337
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:42,345
Syd. Syd, you are at
her going-away party.

338
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,680
If you don't calm down,
you'll drive me...

339
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:50,349
...and you, and everyone else,
and her at this fucking party crazy.

340
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:53,496
Just say goodbye and let her go,
because she's gone.

341
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:56,723
She's gone, man.

342
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:02,671
Line, anyone?

343
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:08,443
No. No, thank you.
But do you have a cigarette?

344
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:10,374
I'm sorry.

345
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:42,574
Light. I'm sorry.

346
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:50,611
All right, all right, you know what?
I'm gonna go.

347
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:53,449
-Are you leaving?
-Thank you. Thank you for everything.

348
00:25:53,623 --> 00:25:55,386
-Really.
-Listen, do me a favor.

349
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,925
Don't tell London I'm doing blow
in here. That'll really screw me.

350
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:02,064
You know, Syd, yeah,
you know, I'll try to remember that.

351
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:03,892
Maya, I'm serious. Please?

352
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:17,677
Hey, please tell me you're not doing
coke in my parents' bathroom.

353
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,815
-What?
-I saw you go upstairs.

354
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:21,848
-Where did you go?
-To the bathroom.

355
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:24,782
Swear to God, you're not doing coke
in my parents' house.

356
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:26,319
Oh, my God, I swear to God...

357
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:29,287
...I'm not doing coke
in your parents' house.

358
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:30,790
Okay, I'm sorry, darling.

359
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:35,795
All right.
Have a good time. I'm sorry.

360
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:44,664
How long were you two together?

361
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:48,470
Who? Me and London?
Two and a half years.

362
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:51,277
-You split when?
-Six months and a few days ago.

363
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:53,881
You're counting, Syd.
Not a good sign, mate.

364
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:56,645
Why? Why do you say that?

365
00:26:58,187 --> 00:27:01,554
Joking.
I mean, what's the girl's name?

366
00:27:01,757 --> 00:27:04,157
-Maya. Can I have one of those?
-Maya.

367
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:06,124
Maya.

368
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:08,195
I'd do some terrible things to her.

369
00:27:08,631 --> 00:27:11,498
She's like an X-rated Barbie doll.

370
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:14,366
-How old is she?
-I don't know, like 1 6, 1 7.

371
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:15,868
Seventeen?

372
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,400
-Now I really wanna fuck her.
-You'd fuck a 1 7-year-old?

373
00:27:21,077 --> 00:27:22,908
What, you wouldn't?

374
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,147
If it's not against the law,
what's the problem?

375
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:28,374
You can fuck a 1 5-year-old
in France.

376
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:30,314
Does that make them
all pedophiles?

377
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:33,819
Right situation, right country,
you'd fuck one too, believe you me.

378
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,858
Right, right. International waters,
deserted island, shit can happen.

379
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:41,394
But if any of my female friends
knew I fucked a 1 7-year-old...

380
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:43,862
-...they'd lose it.
-What's the matter with you?

381
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:46,729
If we told women a tenth of
the things we think and do...

382
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:48,564
...do you think we'd ever get laid?

383
00:27:48,738 --> 00:27:51,673
-Like when I asked a girl to piss on me.
-To piss on you?

384
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:56,509
Yes, mate, but I was on
a horrible amount of X at the time.

385
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,579
Did she piss on you?

386
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,350
Actually, no...

387
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,847
...she pissed in my mouth.

388
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:10,051
She pissed in your mouth?

389
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:12,353
It was not a pleasant experience,
believe me.

390
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:15,896
How the fuck does that happen?

391
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:20,194
What is the conversation that leads to
a girl having to piss in your mouth?

392
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:21,960
It was a fucking mistress.

393
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:25,595
-You paid an S & M chick?
-Many times.

394
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,966
"Many times."

395
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:33,644
Listen, it's an expensive hobby,
both mentally and financially.

396
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:36,248
So, what's the deal?
How does it work?

397
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:40,280
I don't know if I want
to go there, you know?

398
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:44,084
Come on, explain it. No one cares.
Did you get your shit wet? Me too.

399
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:48,218
It's my fucking Savile Row suit.
It's fucking 5 G's.

400
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:51,854
I've kept it out of the rain all day.
Look at the state of it.

401
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,628
Look, I don't wanna go there.
All right, Syd?

402
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:56,236
Come on. I'm not gonna tell.

403
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,804
-Why the fuck do you wanna know?
-How does it work?

404
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:02,431
-You just go over there?
-Look at you, you fucking dirtbag.

405
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,771
-You brought it up.
-You wanna go there...

406
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:08,279
...you fucking go there. Leave my
fucking demons to myself, mate.

407
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,441
-Where is it?
-Tribeca, you cunt.

408
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:12,950
Explain it. How does it work?
You just walk over?

409
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:16,686
Look, you phone from downstairs,,,

410
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:21,294
,,,and magically they let you in
through these enormous iron gates,

411
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:24,489
You get all excited,

412
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,601
You get all wrapped up,
You can't wait to get in there,

413
00:29:30,338 --> 00:29:33,330
The whole thought of it just
gets amongst your fucking veins,

414
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:34,998
You're into it, you know?

415
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:37,144
All of a sudden,
they give you a form.

416
00:29:37,312 --> 00:29:40,975
it's a five-page disclaimer
in fucking triplicate,

417
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:44,448
And you're like, "Hold on.
What is this? Paperwork?

418
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,314
I've come here
to get my dick sucked.

419
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:48,854
I didn't come here to sign forms."
It's hilarious.

420
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:52,481
You don't pay them,
you give them a fucking donation.

421
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,289
I mean, that is so American, isn't it?
Come on.

422
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:59,956
And then they give you a list and
a little pencil, like in the sushi bar,

423
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:03,126
You start checking off the
requirements, Whipping, spanking--

424
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:09,233
Come on, you fucking dirty
shit-cunt whore. Fucking whip me!

425
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:11,469
--nipple clamps, coprophilia,

426
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:13,978
-What's coprophilia?
-When they shit on you.

427
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:15,815
Shit in your mouth.

428
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:19,249
You can have it in the mouth
or you can have it over a glass table,

429
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:22,753
Can you imagine? They fucking
wheel out a glass table and they just,,,

430
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:25,755
...shit all over it,
and you're just like:

431
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,860
"You dirty bitch!"

432
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:31,396
Who the fuck
asks for that fucking misery?

433
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:33,932
I hope not you.

434
00:30:34,102 --> 00:30:35,535
Yeah, what about me?

435
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:41,171
Anyway, you know, there's a lot--
I mean, the list is long, mate.

436
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:43,776
-lnfantilism, you've got--
-What's infantilism?

437
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:46,003
They make you a baby,
give you a bottle,

438
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,172
Put you in diapers, nurse you,
turn you into an infant.

439
00:30:50,018 --> 00:30:53,920
I mean, it's the sickest,
most twisted place you'll ever go.

440
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,521
I mean, they claw your balls.

441
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,749
They'll tie your cock up
with a shoelace...

442
00:30:57,926 --> 00:31:02,989
...stick truncheons up your ass.
It's twisted. It's fucking twisted.

443
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:06,029
But I'm telling you,
the moment you come....

444
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,259
The moment you come,
you are so sober.

445
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:12,937
i mean, so fucking sober,

446
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:17,407
You're like, "What have i just done?
What the fuck have i just done?

447
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:21,208
i've just paid $275
for some stranger,,,

448
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:24,044
,,,some chick i don't even know,
to, like, whip me,,,

449
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,049
,,,and piss on my head, "

450
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:30,216
So where's the upside?
Why do you do it? I don't get it.

451
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:34,623
Well, on a physical level,
it can be rather pleasurable.

452
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,227
Psychologically-- This is without
getting too deep here.

453
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,494
--I think it has a lot to do
with pain and self-flagellation...

454
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,002
...both literally and metaphorically.

455
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:47,835
I mean, I don't know whether
it's the culture or what...

456
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:51,569
...but the English, in general,
are very into pain and spanking.

457
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:53,611
The English? Really?

458
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:56,409
Yeah, you're always reading
some story in the papers...

459
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:59,178
,,,about some judge or vicar
bent over a hooker's knee,

460
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,923
I didn't know the English
were so fucked up.

461
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:06,617
Mate, the English are very...

462
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:09,786
...I mean, very fucked up.

463
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,802
Yeah, one sec.

464
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:20,868
Sweating like a fucking rapist.

465
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:25,369
Syd.

466
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,309
Come and have a look at the view.

467
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:32,482
Yeah. It's Mallory,
the girl from the bar. I'll hook you up.

468
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,053
-Come back in.
-Who?

469
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:36,019
Mallory. The girl from the bar.

470
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,556
-She's hot. I'll hook you up.
-No, no, mate, no.

471
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:41,490
I'm too-- I'm wanked, mate.
I can't be fucking with girls.

472
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:43,290
So what? So am l.

473
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:45,864
I've been drinking this piss.
No, I can't, fuck it.

474
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,865
-I can't operate like this.
-Who cares?

475
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:50,527
-I'm fucking dizzy.
-She'll be in and out.

476
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:52,798
You help yourself to that,
I'm gonna leave.

477
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:55,169
-It's been a fucking pleasure.
-Don't leave.

478
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:58,073
Please don't fucking leave.
Go get a drink, come back.

479
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:00,237
-No, mate, no.
-Bateman, one fucking drink.

480
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:02,747
Come right back.
Work Mallory, she's hot.

481
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:05,010
Fuck you. A drink of what?
What do you want?

482
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:07,381
Anything. A bottle.
Jack, tequila, whiskey.

483
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,386
You're staying, though, right?

484
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:11,921
-One fucking drink.
-One fucking drink.

485
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:16,028
Fine, fine, just don't go anywhere.
You'll fucking thank me.

486
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:29,671
I haven't had a bump
in like three hours.

487
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:31,675
Bateman, this is my friend Mallory.

488
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:34,041
Mallory, this is Bateman.

489
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,012
Hey.

490
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:37,947
You're the guy from the bar, right?

491
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:40,246
Mallory, yeah?

492
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:41,889
Bateman.

493
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:43,854
Nice to meet you.

494
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:45,788
-Sorry.
-Excuse me.

495
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,793
-What a clumsy idiot.
-Sorry.

496
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:52,525
Well, how do you guys
know each other?

497
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,464
A friend of a friend.

498
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,297
What friend?

499
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:02,433
I don't know, Mallory.
What's with the 20 Questions? Fuck.

500
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,374
Just asking. So, what,
are you leaving or something?

501
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:08,778
I'm just gonna grab us a drink
and then...

502
00:34:09,184 --> 00:34:12,210
...I'm coming back.
Do you want one?

503
00:34:13,488 --> 00:34:15,888
Sure, I'll have another one.

504
00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:17,752
-I'll see you in a minute.
-Good.

505
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:19,484
I'll see you in a minute, Syd.

506
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,463
Damn, kid.

507
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,834
So how do you know that guy?

508
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,008
He got this blow. He's not
a dealer, he just knew the guy.

509
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:39,805
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Good guy, right?

510
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:43,246
-Yeah.
-Hey, you don't know if London's here.

511
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:45,181
Yeah, she got here like a minute ago.

512
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:48,083
What'd she say?
Does she know I'm here?

513
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:51,350
No. She didn't say anything.

514
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:03,097
I can't believe she's leaving tomorrow.
That's just so fucked up to me.

515
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:07,537
Well, instead of staying here all night,
why don't you go out and talk to her.

516
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:10,142
-I'm sure she'd love to talk to you.
-I doubt that.

517
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:13,474
Why wouldn't she wanna talk to you?
You guys in a fight?

518
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:16,139
A fight? Mallory, she hasn't
called me in two months.

519
00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:19,013
I wasn't invited tonight.
Don't you think it's odd...

520
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:22,315
...she wouldn't tell me she's moving
across the fucking country?

521
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,821
-She didn't call you?
-No.

522
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:26,290
-That's fucked up.
-Didn't even leave a message.

523
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:30,488
-I know that girl better than anybody.
-When's the last time you talked?

524
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:33,793
-I don't know, two months.
-Really?

525
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:37,627
-I'm sure she was gonna call you.
-When? I just checked my messages.

526
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:41,866
-ls she gonna call me from LAX?
-Dude, I don't fucking know. Man.

527
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:44,034
Fucked up!

528
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:49,175
Hey, Syd, can I ask you
something personal?

529
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,908
What?

530
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:53,320
Well....

531
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:58,689
It's probably-- I don't know if it's true,
that's obviously why I'm asking...

532
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,352
...and since we're cool and all,
I just figured-- I'm kind of concerned.

533
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:06,523
But l-- Anyway, I kind of heard that--

534
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:09,829
-What? Something about London?
-I heard-- It's probably bullshit.

535
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:12,734
-But I heard you--
-What, Mallory? Spit it out. Fuck.

536
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:17,367
Dude, I kind of heard that
you tried to kill yourself.

537
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:20,875
-What? Who told you that? London?
-No, it wasn't London.

538
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,244
-Who told you that? Who?
-Dude, I don't know.

539
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:24,783
I don't even remember.

540
00:36:24,953 --> 00:36:27,114
London's the only person
that knew about that.

541
00:36:27,322 --> 00:36:30,314
So any way you heard it,
it's pretty fucked up.

542
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,858
-So, what? It's not true?
-No, it's not fucking true.

543
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:37,929
Dude, I don't get it.
What the fuck happened then?

544
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,593
You tell me what you heard happened,
then I'll tell you what really happened.

545
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,965
Just after this bump. Hold up.

546
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:49,399
All right. Okay.

547
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:53,377
I heard that, like, you guys had a fight
or something, and you broke out...

548
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:56,073
...she drove to your place,
found you unconscious...

549
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:59,778
...next to some sleeping pills, and you
had to get your stomach pumped.

550
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:03,446
Okay, now do you wanna know
what really happened?

551
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,922
Yeah. I mean, that's why I asked.

552
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:07,925
-You know my dog, Toker?
-Yeah.

553
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:10,724
-Yes, well, he's epileptic.
-Okay.

554
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:14,664
-So the vet prescribed phenobarbital.
-Pheno--? What the fuck is that?

555
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,394
They're barbiturates.
They're downers, for his fits.

556
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:22,100
Wait a minute. Your dog has epilepsy
and got prescribed--?

557
00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:23,642
Let me finish. Anyway...

558
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:26,780
...it was our two-year anniversary
and she thought I'd forget.

559
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:28,973
-So--
-Syd, you always forget, Always,

560
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:33,649
Oh, fuck.

561
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:41,120
-I feel like such a bitch.
-Well, you are a bitch.

562
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:43,488
Open it.

563
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:46,428
-Open it.
-Okay.

564
00:37:57,212 --> 00:37:59,442
Oh, my God.

565
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,945
This is so gorgeous. How did
you know I wanted this dress?

566
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:07,520
I saw you drooling all over it
last time we were at Valentino.

567
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:09,657
I love it!

568
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,055
Oh, it's so beautiful.

569
00:38:15,063 --> 00:38:18,692
Thank you so much, baby.

570
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:26,031
There's more.

571
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,539
-What is that?
-It's a basketball.

572
00:38:28,877 --> 00:38:34,338
What--? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

573
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:40,910
Hi, little guy. Hi, little guy.

574
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:42,954
Oh, baby.

575
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:49,087
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

576
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:53,166
Look at him.
I can't believe you did this. I--

577
00:38:54,736 --> 00:38:58,001
Thank you. Okay. Okay.

578
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,868
Hello?

579
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:05,009
Hey. Can I just call you back?

580
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:07,439
No, I'm just
in the middle of something.

581
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,879
All right, bye.

582
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:13,347
-Who was that?
-lt was Mallory.

583
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:16,221
Look at his paws.

584
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:24,858
-What? What is it? What's wrong?
-I heard a guy's voice on the phone.

585
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,929
What? Are you fucking crazy?
That was Mallory.

586
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:31,298
You swear to God?

587
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:34,775
Yes, I swear to God.

588
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,911
If you don't fucking believe me,
go ahead and call her.

589
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,572
Syd. Are you really gonna
fucking call her?

590
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:46,110
Yeah, is Mallory there?

591
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:49,646
This is London's boyfriend.
Who the fuck is this?

592
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:53,550
London, what the fuck is this?
Who was that? Why did you lie?

593
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:56,424
-Let me just explain.
-You better fucking explain.

594
00:39:56,598 --> 00:39:58,759
What? Why did you lie?
Are you cheating on me?

595
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:01,060
No, no. Listen.

596
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,567
I was really fucked up.
I was out with the girls.

597
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:06,002
-Fucking perfect.
-Are you gonna let me explain?

598
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:08,472
Yes, yes, you better
fucking explain, London.

599
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:13,410
Okay, the clubs were closing, we went
back to Becca's boyfriend's loft.

600
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:16,573
I fucking passed out.
I wake up the next morning...

601
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,584
...and the guy-- There was someone
lying in bed next to me.

602
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,085
Then he didn't try anything?

603
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,746
You're fucked up in his bed,
he didn't try anything.

604
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:26,621
I find that hard to believe.
And don't fucking lie to me.

605
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:29,991
If you fucking lie to me,
I'm walking out the fucking door.

606
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:33,497
He tried to kiss me. But there was
nothing because I pushed him away.

607
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:35,761
-lt was not a big deal--
-Define "tried."

608
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:38,030
I wanna know
every single fucking detail.

609
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:41,039
Were you on or under the covers?
Was his hand on your tit?

610
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:44,201
No, Syd. He tries to kiss me
and I pushed him away.

611
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:47,041
-You pushed him away?
-Yes. I walked outside.

612
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:49,513
Mallory called me a cab,
and I went home.

613
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:51,549
If you went home,
why is he calling you?

614
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,846
-How does he have your number?
-I don't know.

615
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:57,185
Maybe Becca's boyfriend
gave him the number.

616
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:59,724
But I definitely didn't give it to him.

617
00:41:00,328 --> 00:41:05,163
Nothing happened. I swear to God.
Don't you fucking believe me? Please.

618
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,698
I don't know what to believe.

619
00:41:06,868 --> 00:41:08,859
You swore that was
Mallory on the phone...

620
00:41:09,037 --> 00:41:10,732
...and it wasn't.
So, what the fuck?

621
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:14,170
We've dated for two years. I believed
everything you said until now.

622
00:41:14,342 --> 00:41:16,333
Now I don't know
what the fuck to believe.

623
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:19,173
It's like your words are meaningless.

624
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:21,842
I just don't trust you anymore,
London.

625
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:24,678
I made a mistake.
I made a fucking huge mistake.

626
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:27,412
-I'm sorry.
-lf it was one fucking mistake...

627
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:29,852
...why did you say
you were gonna call back?

628
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:32,219
Why would you tell a guy
who you don't know...

629
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:35,226
...whose number you don't have,
you're gonna call him back?

630
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:36,727
What the fuck is that?

631
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:41,158
So I took a couple
of Toker's phenobarbital.

632
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:45,500
Wait, you took
your dog's medication?

633
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:49,040
Phenobarbital is phenobarbital.
It doesn't matter if it was for my dog.

634
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:52,839
People have been taking it
recreationally for years.

635
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:54,344
Smoke that.

636
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:57,712
So wait a minute,
what does it do to you?

637
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:00,046
They make you feel good.
They're like downers.

638
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:02,018
-Okay.
-Anyway...

639
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:04,919
...I was pretty drunk
and I took like five or six of them.

640
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:08,084
-Five or six doggy downers?
-Toker's 50 pounds, he takes two.

641
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:11,959
-I'm 1 70, five or six seems pretty good.
-Shit.

642
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:15,294
The problem is that if you're drunk,
you can fall into a coma...

643
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,960
-...if you're not careful.
-You went into a coma?

644
00:42:18,172 --> 00:42:21,573
-What's wrong with you?
-No, I didn't go into a fucking coma.

645
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:23,937
London came back
to apologize or whatever.

646
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:27,878
Syd? Syd!

647
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,079
Syd! Somebody, please, help!

648
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:37,316
It's so fucked up. The fact she's telling
people that makes me so furious.

649
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:40,255
I would never do that to anyone.
It's just fucking rude.

650
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,328
-They never pumped your stomach?
-No, I went to the hospital.

651
00:42:43,497 --> 00:42:46,557
I took a few coherency tests.
That's it. That's all.

652
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:50,295
Do you see how reality gets twisted
when little fucking girls gossip?

653
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:53,736
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess.

654
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:58,308
-What? Do you not believe me?
-No, of course I believe you, Syd.

655
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:01,812
That's why I asked. I was concerned.

656
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:03,916
Makes me so livid
that she's out there...

657
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:07,076
...telling people this warped version
of what happened.

658
00:43:07,621 --> 00:43:11,614
You know what? Just please don't
go out there telling her I told you this.

659
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:13,282
That's the last thing you need.

660
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,985
The last thing I'm gonna do
is mention your name.

661
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:19,690
Well, honestly, if I were you, I wouldn't
even bring the shit up, okay?

662
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:22,427
It's her last night here.
Focus on something positive.

663
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,764
She don't wanna hear that shit.

664
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:29,470
Fuck.

665
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,203
What? What's wrong?

666
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:34,179
I don't know, I don't know.

667
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:38,114
Because I start sweating
and my heart starts pounding...

668
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:41,277
...and I feel like my head's spinning
and the world's crashing.

669
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:45,391
And I get pulled down,
further into, like, the darkest...

670
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,552
...meanest places of my brain,
and I start suffocating.

671
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:51,390
And you feel like you're dying.

672
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:59,066
What? What? Say something.

673
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:03,342
-What would you like me to say?
-Anything. Something. I don't care.

674
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,511
I can't be your crutch, Syd.

675
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:11,173
Oh, you are such a miserable
fucking human being.

676
00:44:11,351 --> 00:44:13,410
Miserable in what way?

677
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:16,680
The way that you're sitting there,
taking my fucking money...

678
00:44:16,857 --> 00:44:20,384
...and I'm dying. Nothing you do
helps me. The Prozac doesn't help.

679
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:24,053
The lithium doesn't help. The Zoloft
doesn't help. Nothing you do helps.

680
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:26,893
You're kind of a fucking asshole.

681
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:35,000
I just wanna fucking
turn the pain off, you know?

682
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:38,542
Just give me something that
the pain can go away with, you know?

683
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:41,681
Can you do that? Don?

684
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,249
I think you're doing great.

685
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:49,514
When that anxiety hits,
it's terrifying...

686
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,215
...because you're like,
"Maybe I'm really going crazy.

687
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:54,690
Maybe I've finally
fucked with my head enough...

688
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:56,693
...that I just detached from reality."

689
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,196
-You have these horrible revelations.
-Like what?

690
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,960
I started freaking out about death.
I became obsessed.

691
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:05,128
I couldn't conceptualize not
being here. Just not being here.

692
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,604
One day, Mallory, you and l
are gonna be dead. Buried. Gone.

693
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:12,041
You think about religion. People are
just swallowing these concepts.

694
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:14,942
Like God and heaven,
just to suppress our deepest fears...

695
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:17,879
...that we don't know why we're here.
It makes no sense.

696
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:19,416
It totally makes sense, okay?

697
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:23,750
At the same time it allows people
to go on living their everyday lives...

698
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:27,223
...without constantly obsessing over
these things. These realities.

699
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:30,830
Life, death, heaven, hell.
Existence, why we're here.

700
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:34,798
You know, who knows,
it's possible that a god does exist.

701
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:38,404
Energy, force, spirit, whatever
you wanna call it. I believe that.

702
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:40,836
Fair enough.
So, what happens when you die?

703
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:44,569
I don't know. You fucking die. Why
does there have to be an answer?

704
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:47,805
Why can't there just be mysteries?
I don't know. Your body dies.

705
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:52,441
Your actual physical being dies,
but your spirit, I do believe, lives on.

706
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:56,419
It lives on in the world. Man, it's this
continuing thing of existence.

707
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,751
It doesn't have to have
a perfect answer why.

708
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:01,486
I buy that a little bit more
than an invisible guy...

709
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:04,028
...taking checks and balances
on 6 million people.

710
00:46:04,198 --> 00:46:06,189
That sounds like Santa Claus to me.

711
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,597
It's like a fairy tale for adults
who can't handle death.

712
00:46:12,472 --> 00:46:14,667
Yeah, because if you think about it...

713
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:18,174
...there was a time that we didn't know
that the world was round...

714
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:21,212
...or that the atom existed
or whatever, right...

715
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:24,008
...because we didn't have
the technology to observe it.

716
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:27,153
And then...one day we do, right?

717
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,154
So, I mean, it's totally
conceivably possible...

718
00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:37,024
...that in our lifetime, we will have
the technology to observe God...

719
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:41,566
...or whatever it is that created us
and the planets...

720
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:44,829
...and the universe
and everything else. Right?

721
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:48,133
It's important to at least have faith
in the possibility...

722
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:51,402
...of a higher being
or something, or whatever...

723
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:53,239
...because otherwise, you're just--

724
00:46:53,446 --> 00:46:56,074
You're gonna drive yourself
completely fucking insane.

725
00:46:56,249 --> 00:46:59,047
Right, but that really is
the operative word isn't it?

726
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:01,244
What do you mean? What word?

727
00:47:01,454 --> 00:47:05,083
"Faith." Because without faith,
what do you have? You have nothing.

728
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:08,659
You got a few stories written 1 00
years ago, thousands of years ago...

729
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:11,023
...by people who are more
clueless than we are.

730
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:14,656
The same people who were crucifying
people who said the world was round.

731
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:18,930
So, you know. I just need more proof.
I need logic to support this religion.

732
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:21,869
Okay, if you want proof,
I will give you proof.

733
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:25,409
There was a study that was done
in Japan with physicists, okay?

734
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:28,548
They took two vats of rice...

735
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:31,740
...they put one in one room,
and one in another room.

736
00:47:31,918 --> 00:47:36,116
They put a time-lapse camera on it
so they could observe it for a month.

737
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:39,947
They let all these people
come into one room...

738
00:47:40,126 --> 00:47:44,688
,,,and they would say, "i love you,
rice, You are the best rice,

739
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:48,561
You are the most beautiful,
most gorgeous, sexy rice there is."

740
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,727
And in the other room,
they say, "l fucking hate you, rice.

741
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:55,966
i hate you, You're the worst rice,
Fuck you, rice, you're the worst rice, "

742
00:47:56,142 --> 00:48:01,580
After a month, the rice that they
said "l love you" to? Still edible.

743
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:04,945
The other rice looks like
fucking black sludge.

744
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:09,780
I saw the pictures. I saw, you know,
the time-lapse video.

745
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:12,390
It's a study. It's real.
I saw it with my own eyes.

746
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,325
That's your proof right there. I mean,
it's energy. We're affecting something.

747
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:20,397
-God is energy.
-London, you're talking about rice.

748
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:23,798
Rice. It has nothing to do with religion.
Nothing to do with God.

749
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,270
-I gave you proof.
-I'm sorry, I don't find proof in that.

750
00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:44,582
You know what your problem is?
You're so undyingly convinced...

751
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:47,750
...that everything your parents
and teachers taught you...

752
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:50,987
...you hold it as
this indisputable, almighty truth.

753
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:54,258
Syd, can we please just drop it?
Can we just fucking drop it?

754
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:57,267
You wanna drop it because
you know I'm right. Admit that...

755
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,769
-...we'll talk about whatever you want.
-Shut up.

756
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:01,770
-Shut the fuck up.
-Just admit it.

757
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:05,104
You're scared to question authority
because what if they're wrong?

758
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:07,473
What if all your parents
and all your elders...

759
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:10,844
...were as scared of death as you,
and brainwashed just like you?

760
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:13,178
You're just blind to see it.

761
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:16,956
Okay, so I'm brainwashed...

762
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:19,956
...because I happen to think
that believing in something...

763
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:25,189
...other than meaninglessness
and nonexistence is a positive thing?

764
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:28,994
-Okay. That's really smart, Syd.
-I'm glad you agree with me.

765
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:31,899
I was being facetious, you dipshit.

766
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:34,539
Why are you calling me a dipshit?

767
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:41,340
Why are you calling me a dipshit?

768
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:43,311
Because...

769
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:48,077
...you always have to be right.
Why do you always have to be right?

770
00:49:48,254 --> 00:49:50,518
And your ego.
Your ego, it's just huge.

771
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,217
-It's just out of fucking control.
-There's no need to freak out.

772
00:49:54,394 --> 00:49:56,385
Syd, because you don't know
when to stop.

773
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:59,327
You keep going
and going and going...

774
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:03,560
...until people just wanna
smash your face in.

775
00:50:03,737 --> 00:50:07,400
Okay, okay.
Maybe God doesn't exist.

776
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:12,273
I guess me and the billions upon
billions and billions of other people...

777
00:50:12,445 --> 00:50:15,539
...who actually pray to something
are completely deluded...

778
00:50:15,715 --> 00:50:19,344
...and you are right.
You are all-knowing.

779
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,511
You're God, Syd. Isn't that what
you wanna fucking hear anyway?

780
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:25,920
-That everyone else is wrong and--?
-Doesn't everybody?

781
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:28,458
And I'm deluded?
And I am fucking deluded?

782
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:31,357
You are-- You're sick.
You're sick, Syd.

783
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:34,022
You need fucking mental help.

784
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,034
God, you make everybody crazy.
You're making me fucking crazy.

785
00:50:38,204 --> 00:50:43,198
You just-- You blanket people with
your pseudo-intellectual bullshit...

786
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:46,539
...and then they can't fucking breathe.
You just suffocate people.

787
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:48,704
You don't talk to people.
You talk at them.

788
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:52,215
At least I talk about real shit.
We've been going out for two years.

789
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:54,910
What's the most intelligent
conversation we've had?

790
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:57,784
How many grams of fat
are in a slice of vegetarian pizza?

791
00:50:57,957 --> 00:51:01,552
-Fuck you! You're so annoying.
-No, fuck you, London!

792
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:03,161
You are more annoying than me.

793
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,422
You get away with it
because no one listens.

794
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:08,999
They stare at your tits,
thinking of ways to fuck you.

795
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:13,468
I can't fucking believe that I ever fell
in love with a fucking asshole like you!

796
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,608
-You're such a fucking asshole!
-Stop!

797
00:51:15,775 --> 00:51:19,302
-I fucking hate you!
-London. Take it easy.

798
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,845
Stop, stop, stop.

799
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,613
Stop. Stop.

800
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:41,998
Stop.

801
00:52:00,653 --> 00:52:03,747
Baby. Come on, now.

802
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:20,965
I'm not gonna get her back, am l?

803
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:32,846
I don't know.

804
00:52:33,887 --> 00:52:35,582
Why don't you go talk to her.

805
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:40,323
Are you leaving?

806
00:52:40,493 --> 00:52:43,223
I'm getting really claustrophobic.
I need to get some air.

807
00:52:43,396 --> 00:52:46,854
-I'm not freaking you out, am l?
-No, I'm so high right now.

808
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,864
I need a drink.

809
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:53,199
-Here, let me give you some of this.
-Can you bring that purse over?

810
00:52:53,373 --> 00:52:55,568
-Yeah, of course.
-Thanks.

811
00:52:55,742 --> 00:52:57,437
Here.

812
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,348
-Oh, thanks, man.
-Here, this is for you.

813
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:05,712
-That's way too much.
-No, please, take it.

814
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:07,944
-You sure?
-Yeah.

815
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:11,682
Thanks, man. That's really sweet.

816
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,297
So you--? Do you wanna
come out there or what?

817
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:25,438
Yeah, I'll be out there in a minute.
I'm gonna...

818
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:28,367
-...just hang here for a minute or two.
-All right.

819
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,771
See you out there, okay?

820
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:43,785
You gotta come out.

821
00:53:49,095 --> 00:53:52,428
Hello, girls. What's your name?

822
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:55,932
We're at a party, come on.
What are you reading a book for?

823
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,462
Fancy a smoke in the little room?

824
00:53:58,638 --> 00:54:01,402
We're reading, actually,
about robopathology.

825
00:54:01,574 --> 00:54:03,667
Complicated little thing, aren't you?

826
00:54:03,876 --> 00:54:06,606
I was gonna leave,
then I had to make a beeline to you.

827
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:09,009
Like I feel I know you
or something like that.

828
00:54:09,182 --> 00:54:11,582
On a one-to-ten scale...

829
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:13,612
...you're a four. In dim light.

830
00:54:13,786 --> 00:54:17,244
One lantern so I wouldn't have to
see your heinous, disfigured face.

831
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:19,584
You are absolutely--
You're beautiful.

832
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:22,325
I have to go.
That's my chopper. But before I do--

833
00:54:22,495 --> 00:54:23,962
-It's picking you up?
-Yeah.

834
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,961
I invented this move:

835
00:54:26,899 --> 00:54:28,264
She likes me. She's laughing.

836
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:32,131
-How old are you?
-Eighteen.

837
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:35,402
Eighteen.

838
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:40,108
Let me just get another drink now.

839
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:50,387
Stop. I'm not hitting on you.

840
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:53,024
-I like your shoes.
-You do?

841
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:55,626
-Excuse me. Hey, girl, I'm out of here.
-Already?

842
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:57,990
-I'm gonna miss you.
-I'm gonna miss you too.

843
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:00,462
-Thank you so much for coming.
-You're welcome.

844
00:55:00,633 --> 00:55:03,329
-Don't get shallow on me.
-I promise. Are you kidding me?

845
00:55:03,503 --> 00:55:05,903
-I'm sorry. I'll see you later.
-Nice to meet you.

846
00:55:06,072 --> 00:55:08,700
Call us when you get home.
Let us know you're okay.

847
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,815
All right, all right, all right, come on.

848
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:18,814
Come on, Syd.

849
00:55:19,585 --> 00:55:24,318
You gotta mellow out.
You gotta mellow out.

850
00:55:24,524 --> 00:55:27,755
You need a beer.
You need a bottle.

851
00:55:29,362 --> 00:55:31,023
Okay.

852
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:36,024
Stop doing blow.
You gotta stop doing coke.

853
00:55:37,537 --> 00:55:41,530
Don't grind your teeth. If she sees
you grind your teeth, you're fucked.

854
00:55:44,744 --> 00:55:47,178
Come on, Syd.
Mellow out, mellow out.

855
00:55:47,547 --> 00:55:49,481
Be a man. Be a man.

856
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:52,382
There. Get a drink.
Go out there, get a drink.

857
00:55:52,552 --> 00:55:55,749
What's the worst that can happen?
What's the worst that can happen?

858
00:55:56,422 --> 00:55:58,413
I can see London. So what?

859
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:01,685
Fuck. Fuck.

860
00:56:03,696 --> 00:56:06,893
Okay. You fuck up tonight, it's over.

861
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:20,568
Okay.

862
00:56:30,423 --> 00:56:32,220
Come on.

863
00:56:33,926 --> 00:56:35,826
You know I do.

864
00:56:36,028 --> 00:56:39,088
Well, if you do, if you love me,
why don't you just say it?

865
00:56:39,265 --> 00:56:43,964
Why can't you just fucking say it?
Why is it so impossible for you?

866
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:46,799
It's-- It's three words.

867
00:56:46,973 --> 00:56:50,670
It's-- L-O-V-E Y--
It's eight fucking letters.

868
00:56:50,843 --> 00:56:53,004
You can't say eight fucking letters?

869
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:55,613
It's not a lot of letters.

870
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:31,947
Say it.

871
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:48,157
Tell me you were not doing
cocaine in my parents' bathroom.

872
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:50,802
-What are you talking about?
-Don't "what are you talking about" me.

873
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,667
-I saw you go upstairs.
-Yeah, I went to the fucking bathroom.

874
00:57:54,841 --> 00:57:56,172
-Really?
-Yeah, I had to pee.

875
00:57:56,342 --> 00:57:59,175
Well, swear to God
you're not doing cocaine.

876
00:58:02,014 --> 00:58:03,879
Who the fuck is Bateman?

877
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,678
That's his friend or some shit.
I don't know.

878
00:58:06,853 --> 00:58:08,480
He's hot.

879
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:11,487
I think I want to have
hot coke sex with him.

880
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:15,491
You fucking did cocaine!
Don't fuck with me. Are you?

881
00:58:15,661 --> 00:58:18,824
Yeah, man, he's hot.
I like guys with accents.

882
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:21,023
Oh, my God.

883
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:24,066
I gotta go.

884
00:58:29,408 --> 00:58:32,741
-So I met your girl, mate.
-What do you mean, you met her?

885
00:58:33,145 --> 00:58:36,842
Mallory, she introduced us.

886
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:39,844
I didn't say I knew you.
I didn't wanna blow your cover.

887
00:58:40,352 --> 00:58:43,549
But, my God,
she is painfully gorgeous.

888
00:58:43,722 --> 00:58:45,053
Yeah, no shit.

889
00:58:45,224 --> 00:58:47,385
I'd go out there
and speak to her immediately.

890
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:50,551
I can't go out there like this.
I'm not thinking right.

891
00:58:50,729 --> 00:58:53,596
If she knows I'm on blow,
she won't even talk to me.

892
00:58:53,766 --> 00:58:56,792
Fuck! How do I look?
Do I look like I'm on blow?

893
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:59,961
-No, you're fine.
-No, look at me. Look at my eyes.

894
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:06,203
A bit, yeah.

895
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:09,542
Come on. Drink some more booze.
You'll be fine.

896
00:59:09,748 --> 00:59:13,809
What was I thinking,
getting these tonight? So stupid, Syd.

897
00:59:13,986 --> 00:59:17,581
I just wanted to clear my head out.
Try and think a little bit clearer.

898
00:59:17,756 --> 00:59:21,123
Now I'm so fucking spun
I can't even think straight.

899
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,156
-Fuck.
-Happens, mate.

900
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:27,992
I've never been particularly social
on this shit, anyway.

901
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,829
It's a lonely, lonely drug.

902
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:34,004
This is fucking crazy.

903
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,830
I should bail. I can't do this.

904
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:39,102
-Should I bail?
-You could.

905
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:44,071
-I think you'd regret it.
-Why? Why do you say that?

906
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:46,649
Personally, I'd rather
regret something I'd done...

907
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:49,413
...than something
I was too afraid to do.

908
00:59:50,756 --> 00:59:52,781
No shit.

909
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:56,321
But I haven't talked to this girl
in two fucking months.

910
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:59,987
Everybody here hates me.
These are all her friends.

911
01:00:00,632 --> 01:00:06,537
If I go out there, it is gonna get
fucking ugly. Fucking ugly.

912
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:18,776
You'd think they'd have something to
take the edge off a chick leaving you.

913
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:22,785
That'd be nice.
Look, they have this theory.

914
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:24,684
Maybe it'll help. I don't know.

915
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:28,559
Fuck knows where it comes from.
The broad strokes of it are...

916
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,728
...that it takes a third of the time...

917
01:00:30,896 --> 01:00:34,457
...to recover from a relationship
as the relationship was long.

918
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:37,659
So, for example,
if the relationship lasted a year...

919
01:00:37,836 --> 01:00:39,633
...you'll be good in four months.

920
01:00:39,805 --> 01:00:43,172
-Two years, you'll be clean in eight.
-It's not a third, it's a half.

921
01:00:44,977 --> 01:00:48,572
-Mate, it's a third. Trust me.
-No, mate, it's a half.

922
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,305
Maybe in England it's a third.
In America it's a half.

923
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:54,919
I dated her for two years. It's been
six months and it's getting worse.

924
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:59,217
Six months? Come on.
What are you complaining about?

925
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:01,154
You've got two months to go.

926
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:02,850
Good behavior, maybe a month.

927
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:05,356
Bro, I appreciate the pep talk...

928
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:08,227
...but if you haven't noticed,
I'm trying to get this girl back.

929
01:01:09,868 --> 01:01:13,497
Look, I don't know if first love
applies to that theory, anyway.

930
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:19,169
It's been years, I still have these
horribly lucid dreams about Helen.

931
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:23,713
It's almost like your brain is trying
to compensate for the absence.

932
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:28,250
You know, you think you're
still married, you're still in love...

933
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:31,516
...Iife's just beautiful.

934
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:35,091
All of a sudden, you wake up, look
over and she's been gone for years.

935
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:39,128
-Fucking horrendous.
-Yeah, no shit.

936
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:45,030
So you were married before?

937
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:47,572
How long ago?

938
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,935
Divorced three years ago.

939
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:54,606
-Who divorced who?
-It's not that simple.

940
01:01:55,647 --> 01:01:57,740
Well, what happened?
Why did you guys split?

941
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:02,615
-Long story, mate.
-Give me the abridged version.

942
01:02:02,788 --> 01:02:05,985
"The abridged version."
Look, I don't know.

943
01:02:06,158 --> 01:02:09,457
The relationship just didn't work
on so many levels.

944
01:02:09,762 --> 01:02:12,128
We both had one foot out the door
for two years...

945
01:02:12,297 --> 01:02:14,663
...of our two-and-a-half-year
marriage.

946
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,837
You know, but it's weird. You know,
when they tell you they're leaving...

947
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:22,303
...it's like you don't even
feel the hollowness.

948
01:02:22,474 --> 01:02:24,339
It's an emptiness
within an emptiness...

949
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,274
...and you're left with
slightly less than nothing.

950
01:02:28,013 --> 01:02:32,609
The person you were when you met
doesn't exist anymore. You're gone.

951
01:02:35,254 --> 01:02:39,987
-So she left you?
-Syd, it's very fucking complicated.

952
01:02:40,692 --> 01:02:42,853
What happened?
Did you cheat on her?

953
01:02:43,028 --> 01:02:46,794
-No, no. It's irrelevant.
-lrrelevant? How is it irrelevant?

954
01:02:46,965 --> 01:02:50,628
Besides money, infidelity's the most
relevant reason why people split up.

955
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:52,703
Yeah, yeah. True, true.

956
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:55,272
Come on, man.
I thought we were talking.

957
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,432
Let's talk, let's talk.
Why did your wife leave you?

958
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:01,306
Syd, it's not a pleasant scene
for me, please.

959
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,142
Oh, my scene's pleasant?

960
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:06,816
Mate, I've been 21 before.
I know your pain.

961
01:03:06,985 --> 01:03:09,818
But where you're pushing me now
is not a place you wanna go.

962
01:03:09,988 --> 01:03:13,116
Wait. Are you trying to say
that since you're older than me...

963
01:03:13,292 --> 01:03:15,556
-...your pain is somehow more?
-That's the case.

964
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:17,058
Listen, first of all...

965
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:20,357
...you don't have the slightest clue
what pain I've been through.

966
01:03:20,532 --> 01:03:22,523
Just since you're
a couple decades older...

967
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:25,636
...doesn't mean that your pain is more
than mine. It doesn't.

968
01:03:25,804 --> 01:03:27,704
Secondly, don't make
blind comparisons...

969
01:03:27,873 --> 01:03:30,501
...when you have no fucking clue
what you're comparing.

970
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:35,204
You think having your heart broken
is pain? You think losing God is pain?

971
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,905
Mate, I went through that trivial shit
when I was 20.

972
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:40,381
I'm 40 now, mate.

973
01:03:40,652 --> 01:03:43,883
Where you're trying to push me now
is not a place you wanna go.

974
01:03:44,056 --> 01:03:48,584
So why don't you do yourself a favor,
and don't fucking go there with me.

975
01:03:50,329 --> 01:03:52,320
You're a fucking child.
You're just a kid.

976
01:03:52,497 --> 01:03:53,828
A kid?

977
01:03:53,999 --> 01:03:55,660
Listen, you pompous, limey fuck...

978
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:59,235
...if you had one tenth my pain,
you'd be psychologically crippled.

979
01:03:59,404 --> 01:04:03,238
Mate, seriously, fuck off.
All we're doing is projecting shit here.

980
01:04:03,408 --> 01:04:06,036
Look, take a step back.
Let's relax, shall we?

981
01:04:06,211 --> 01:04:09,578
-Do a bit of gear. Come on.
-Fuck the gear. I don't want that shit.

982
01:04:11,884 --> 01:04:14,114
-More for me.
-It's Bateman, right?

983
01:04:14,286 --> 01:04:17,119
-Nice to see your memory is still intact.
-Well, Bateman...

984
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:21,521
...Iet me give you a glimpse into
my life, insight into my fucking pain.

985
01:04:21,693 --> 01:04:25,129
-Mate, it's not necessary. Truly.
-No, it is necessary.

986
01:04:25,297 --> 01:04:28,562
And if you didn't think it was,
you wouldn't have pushed my buttons.

987
01:04:28,734 --> 01:04:30,895
But you did.
And if you don't wanna hear it...

988
01:04:31,069 --> 01:04:34,038
...stop snorting my shit
and get the fuck out of the bathroom.

989
01:04:34,273 --> 01:04:37,970
Technically, it's my shit,
but I can see you're passionate, so go.

990
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,304
So this fucker...

991
01:04:40,512 --> 01:04:44,448
...this fucking guy out in L.A.,
who my chick is now in love with...

992
01:04:44,616 --> 01:04:47,414
...he's, you know, endowed.

993
01:04:47,586 --> 01:04:50,646
-She told you that?
-Yeah. So I needed to know how big.

994
01:04:50,822 --> 01:04:53,120
Not that I give a fuck
about another guy's dick.

995
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:55,954
It's one of those things
you feel like you need to know.

996
01:04:56,128 --> 01:04:58,323
So we're in an argument,
and I was pushing her.

997
01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:59,827
I was like, "How big is he?"

998
01:05:00,032 --> 01:05:03,798
She was like, "Let's not make an issue
out of it." And I said, "No, fuck that."

999
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:07,268
And she says,
"Ten and a half inches."

1000
01:05:07,439 --> 01:05:09,964
-Jesus.
-Yeah, you believe that shit?

1001
01:05:10,142 --> 01:05:12,804
She could have at least
rounded it down.

1002
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:15,913
-The girl's trying to hurt you, mate.
-Yeah, no shit.

1003
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:19,949
But it really fucked with me, you know.
Knowing that this guy is in L.A...

1004
01:05:20,118 --> 01:05:23,451
...with the only woman I love,
fucking her with 1 0 and a half inches.

1005
01:05:23,622 --> 01:05:27,752
I'm chasing her around like a puppy,
doing anything I can to get her back.

1006
01:05:28,093 --> 01:05:32,086
And it crushed me!
It still fucking crushes me!

1007
01:05:36,168 --> 01:05:37,999
Sorry, mate.

1008
01:05:39,504 --> 01:05:42,439
-How exactly do you deal with that?
-You don't deal with it.

1009
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:44,598
It deals with you.

1010
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:49,712
God, it eats at you
and it eats at you, you know?

1011
01:05:50,882 --> 01:05:54,340
We'd get in these fights,
and I'd say the most horrible things.

1012
01:05:54,653 --> 01:05:58,384
I'd be like, "You just want a fat cock
in your fat snatch, you fucking whore."

1013
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:00,956
You know, l'd--
Just mean, horrible things.

1014
01:06:01,126 --> 01:06:03,856
I'd be so fucking angry, you know?

1015
01:06:06,865 --> 01:06:10,892
I used to say the same shit, mate. I
used to say the most horrendous shit.

1016
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:13,162
Why? What'd she do?

1017
01:06:16,108 --> 01:06:18,133
She didn't really do anything.

1018
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:21,404
You know, I imagine that
a lot of it had to do with me.

1019
01:06:21,613 --> 01:06:24,411
A lot of it had to with my hang-ups
and depression and shit.

1020
01:06:24,616 --> 01:06:29,315
But, my God, I used to say the worst
shit to her. I tormented that girl.

1021
01:06:29,488 --> 01:06:32,753
I lived with her for three and a half
fucking years and I hated her.

1022
01:06:32,924 --> 01:06:34,255
So, what was the final snap?

1023
01:06:34,426 --> 01:06:36,986
Did you cheat on her?
Did she cheat on you?

1024
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:38,493
No, no. God, no.

1025
01:06:38,663 --> 01:06:41,655
-How do you know?
-Because I didn't, you know? I didn't.

1026
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:45,360
-How do you know she didn't?
-I know she didn't. It wasn't her thing.

1027
01:06:45,537 --> 01:06:46,868
How do you know?

1028
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,530
I was with the most beautiful girl
in the universe.

1029
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:52,370
She didn't fuck me
for two fucking years!

1030
01:06:52,544 --> 01:06:54,341
-Why?
-I don't know.

1031
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:57,038
Because we fought. I was in therapy.

1032
01:06:57,215 --> 01:07:00,582
I don't-- I don't-- Look, I don't know.

1033
01:07:03,021 --> 01:07:05,046
If you wanna know it is, I'll tell you.

1034
01:07:05,223 --> 01:07:07,384
You remember sentences
that people say to you.

1035
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:11,051
They stick in your mind like gunshot
wounds that never fucking heal.

1036
01:07:12,564 --> 01:07:15,590
I remember what my ex-wife
said to me when we started dating.

1037
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:20,295
She said, "l love it when a guy
fucks me four, five times a night."

1038
01:07:20,472 --> 01:07:23,373
-Four, five times a night?
-Yeah. Truly.

1039
01:07:23,542 --> 01:07:25,169
I was like, "You was with some guy...

1040
01:07:25,343 --> 01:07:28,437
...who fucked you
four, five times a night?"

1041
01:07:29,548 --> 01:07:31,616
-You wanna know what pain is?
-What?

1042
01:07:31,616 --> 01:07:33,585
-I'll tell you what pain is, you fuck.
-Why you calling me a fuck?

1043
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:34,813
-I'll tell you what pain is, you fuck.
-Why you calling me a fuck?

1044
01:07:34,986 --> 01:07:37,318
Because, my friend,
you brought me here...

1045
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:40,821
...and I didn't particularly
wanna go here, but now I am.

1046
01:07:40,992 --> 01:07:43,153
If you don't wanna go
where I'm about to go...

1047
01:07:43,328 --> 01:07:46,229
...then tell me right now
and I'll walk out the door...

1048
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:49,264
...I'll phone my therapist
and that will be it, okay?

1049
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:52,403
No, fuck that, I wanna hear this.
You're not going anywhere.

1050
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,664
-You wanna know what it is?
-Yes, I wanna know what it is.

1051
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,241
Motherfucker, you wanna know
what it is? Pain, my friend...

1052
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:02,140
...is when the woman you love
wants to fuck you...

1053
01:08:02,313 --> 01:08:05,009
...four, five times a night,
and you can't!

1054
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:08,777
-Why?
-Why? Why?

1055
01:08:08,953 --> 01:08:12,116
I'll tell you why.
Because I'm an impotent man!

1056
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:15,350
Motherfucker, that's pain!

1057
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:17,687
That's fucking pain!

1058
01:08:17,862 --> 01:08:21,025
When your wife wants
to fuck you four times a night...

1059
01:08:21,232 --> 01:08:22,859
...and you fucking can't!

1060
01:08:23,034 --> 01:08:25,025
You know that some fucker
before you could.

1061
01:08:25,236 --> 01:08:29,639
And you know that some fucker
after you will!

1062
01:08:31,743 --> 01:08:34,268
Well, I couldn't
cope with that, could l?

1063
01:08:34,445 --> 01:08:36,709
That sense of ruination...

1064
01:08:36,881 --> 01:08:39,816
...that insolvency
that burns in your soul.

1065
01:08:39,984 --> 01:08:42,179
I couldn't fuck my wife!

1066
01:08:42,353 --> 01:08:44,378
Do know what
that fucking means, mate?

1067
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:48,651
Do you understand
what impotent rage really is?!

1068
01:08:48,826 --> 01:08:51,659
-I'm sorry.
-You have no fucking idea, mate!

1069
01:08:54,866 --> 01:08:57,130
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?

1070
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:58,666
Oh, you're sorry, are you?

1071
01:08:59,671 --> 01:09:03,971
You dare, you fucking dare
ask me if there's a God?

1072
01:09:04,142 --> 01:09:09,239
Well, man, I feel forsaken.
I feel cheated, you cunt!

1073
01:09:09,414 --> 01:09:15,580
I've lost in the big game,
and nothing else fucking matters.

1074
01:09:15,787 --> 01:09:19,587
It doesn't matter what you do.
If you can't hack it in the sack, mate...

1075
01:09:19,791 --> 01:09:23,056
...if you can't hack it
in the game of love and sex...

1076
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:24,854
...you are shit, my friend.

1077
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:29,689
Because you can't do what the other
man can do to your fucking wife, mate!

1078
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:38,436
I know what you mean.

1079
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:42,045
No, motherfucker,
you do not know what I mean!

1080
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:46,714
You couldn't possibly know
what the fuck I mean!

1081
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:53,849
I failed.

1082
01:09:54,025 --> 01:09:56,459
I fucking failed, mate.

1083
01:09:58,396 --> 01:10:02,025
And I'm still failing
every fucking day of my life!

1084
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,327
Every day.

1085
01:10:06,437 --> 01:10:08,905
Every fucking day.

1086
01:10:23,788 --> 01:10:25,255
You know....

1087
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,888
Thought you were gonna
clock me for a minute.

1088
01:10:28,092 --> 01:10:31,220
I wasn't gonna hit you.
I'm projecting.

1089
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:34,922
You should see my group therapy
sessions. They're fucking psychotic.

1090
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,434
Yeah, I'll bet.

1091
01:10:37,635 --> 01:10:42,072
Mate, do yourself a favor,
please, for me.

1092
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,401
Go and talk to your chick.

1093
01:10:45,443 --> 01:10:48,606
I can't. To be honest, I'm thinking
about making for the elevator.

1094
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:51,908
I can't go out like this.
She doesn't even want me here.

1095
01:10:52,483 --> 01:10:55,111
Look, I hate to break it to you, mate...

1096
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,986
...but by now
she knows you're here...

1097
01:10:58,156 --> 01:11:00,647
...and, unfortunately,
time is not on your side.

1098
01:11:00,825 --> 01:11:03,794
What are you gonna do,
wait outside like a fucking stalker?

1099
01:11:03,961 --> 01:11:05,929
Wouldn't be the first time.

1100
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:11,601
-Go, man, go. Come on.
-No, I can't, I can't, I can't.

1101
01:11:12,003 --> 01:11:14,335
Listen to me. God.

1102
01:11:14,839 --> 01:11:17,774
Listen to me, you might not have
a 1 0-and-a-half-inch cock...

1103
01:11:17,942 --> 01:11:20,001
...but at least you can still fuck her.

1104
01:11:20,178 --> 01:11:22,646
So quit worrying about
all the bullshit.

1105
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:26,839
The fact is, she's here, you're here.

1106
01:11:27,018 --> 01:11:30,920
Life's too short
to be a pussy, mate. Truly.

1107
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:35,148
Come on.

1108
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:08,018
I think I would love to do that. I don't
really know a lot of people there.

1109
01:12:08,192 --> 01:12:11,093
Not a whole lot going on in L.A.,
but we'll find something.

1110
01:12:11,262 --> 01:12:14,026
Hey, London.
Could I talk to you for a second?

1111
01:12:14,198 --> 01:12:15,859
Yeah. What is it?
What do you want?

1112
01:12:19,737 --> 01:12:22,900
I wanna know if we can go somewhere
and talk for a second, please.

1113
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:27,875
You don't wanna talk here?
We can't just talk right here?

1114
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:30,410
Please.

1115
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:32,879
Syd,
A, this is my going-away party...

1116
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:36,713
...and I think it would be pretty uncool
to the people who threw it for me...

1117
01:12:36,887 --> 01:12:39,720
...if I left just because
you wanted to talk.

1118
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:42,586
And, B, I don't know
if you noticed...

1119
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:45,694
...but we were kind of
in the middle of a conversation...

1120
01:12:45,863 --> 01:12:47,728
...so I don't know what to tell you.

1121
01:12:51,035 --> 01:12:54,869
Listen, I'm gonna grab another drink.
Can l--? Can I get you something?

1122
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,930
Actually, yeah.

1123
01:12:58,108 --> 01:13:00,542
I'd love something.
Something strong.

1124
01:13:00,711 --> 01:13:02,269
-Fuck me up.
-All right.

1125
01:13:04,014 --> 01:13:07,040
What about you, bruiser?
What are you drinking?

1126
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,212
Is that a bottle of cockblocker?

1127
01:13:21,265 --> 01:13:22,892
So....

1128
01:13:23,267 --> 01:13:26,498
I heard you've been snorting drugs
all night. Really productive.

1129
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,070
I heard you told people
I tried to kill myself.

1130
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:32,106
That's really fucking great of you.
I really appreciate it.

1131
01:13:32,276 --> 01:13:34,767
Who the fuck told you that?
I would never say that.

1132
01:13:34,945 --> 01:13:37,277
-You know that.
-The fact is, I have known you...

1133
01:13:37,448 --> 01:13:40,110
...since you were 1 0.
We have been through everything.

1134
01:13:40,284 --> 01:13:42,184
And you don't have
the decency to call--

1135
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:44,944
-Please keep your voice down?
-What the fuck is that?!

1136
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:47,953
-You wanna talk? Fine, let's go.
-Get the fuck off me.

1137
01:13:49,093 --> 01:13:50,993
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1138
01:13:51,962 --> 01:13:54,021
-I'm sorry, excuse me. I'm sorry.
-What?

1139
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:56,995
-London, are you okay?
-Yeah.

1140
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:59,294
We're just gonna--
We're gonna go and talk.

1141
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:03,133
Yeah? Because if you want, I'll call
security and have him taken out.

1142
01:14:03,307 --> 01:14:05,969
Becca, could you do me a favor?
Stay out of this?

1143
01:14:06,176 --> 01:14:09,942
You've been doing coke in the
bathroom all night so don't tell me...

1144
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,604
...what I can and can't do
in my own fucking house...

1145
01:14:12,783 --> 01:14:14,842
...considering you
weren't even invited.

1146
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:17,645
It's cool, Bec. We're gonna go.
It's gonna be fine.

1147
01:14:17,821 --> 01:14:20,881
It's not cool, London.
Baby, he wasn't invited.

1148
01:14:21,091 --> 01:14:23,184
You didn't want him here,
I didn't want him.

1149
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,954
-No one wants him here.
-Becca, can you relax? Please?

1150
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:29,121
-Don't tell me to relax.
-Why can't you relax for two seconds?

1151
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:31,961
-We're leaving.
-You're shouting at my fucking party.

1152
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,569
Also you're psychotic.
You couldn't take a hint...

1153
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:37,901
...if it smashed you in the face.
She doesn't want to be with you.

1154
01:14:38,108 --> 01:14:40,406
-Not even 20 seconds.
-We're leaving. Let's go.

1155
01:14:40,611 --> 01:14:42,875
-Bec, we're leaving. I'm sorry.
-You know what?

1156
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:46,038
I'm sorry, London, and I'm not
trying to be a bitch here...

1157
01:14:46,216 --> 01:14:48,548
...but when you come back,
you come back alone.

1158
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,483
I don't want you
in my house again, all right?

1159
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,019
Or I will call the cops.

1160
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:56,057
Becca, I'm really trying
to be calm here, all right?

1161
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,388
Fuck off. I'm so tired of you
and your psycho fucking shit.

1162
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:01,029
You wanna talk about psycho?

1163
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:03,666
-Let's talk about your fucked-up life.
-Stop it.

1164
01:15:03,934 --> 01:15:07,097
-Fuck you!
-Fuck this! You wanna fuck with me?

1165
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:10,035
You wanna fuck with me?
Let's do it right fucking now.

1166
01:15:11,275 --> 01:15:13,368
Why don't you fuck off, alrighty?

1167
01:15:13,544 --> 01:15:15,739
You weren't even invited to this.

1168
01:15:15,913 --> 01:15:19,576
-You wanna fuck with me?
-Stop it. We're leaving right now!

1169
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:23,514
How many friends did you fuck
freshman year? Fifteen, 20?

1170
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:26,850
I think I lost count. Was it
the whole fucking pledge class?

1171
01:15:27,057 --> 01:15:29,048
Jay, you never really know
your girlfriend.

1172
01:15:29,226 --> 01:15:31,023
Isn't that a total mind-fuck?

1173
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:33,092
You're a fucking bastard!

1174
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:37,255
You fucking wanker! Get the fuck
out of my fucking house!

1175
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:40,066
Hey!

1176
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:42,101
-Fuck you.
-Come on, then!

1177
01:15:42,306 --> 01:15:45,070
Fucking prick.
You want some, you fucking slag?

1178
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,212
Hey, Syd!

1179
01:15:53,784 --> 01:15:56,981
Here, you cunt.
Have some of that, you fuck.

1180
01:15:57,187 --> 01:15:58,586
Fuck off. Come on, then.

1181
01:16:05,462 --> 01:16:07,089
Hey, Syd!

1182
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:13,328
Get off, you fucking asshole.

1183
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:16,403
You fucker. Get the fuck off him.

1184
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:18,438
Come on.

1185
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:20,436
Wait a minute, I gotta get Bateman.

1186
01:16:20,611 --> 01:16:23,705
What? Who the fuck is Bateman?

1187
01:16:24,848 --> 01:16:28,340
Come on, you cunts!
You want some, do you? Do you?

1188
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:31,214
Let's go, Bateman. Come on.

1189
01:16:34,024 --> 01:16:36,686
-My coat. My Burberry coat.
-Fuck it, leave the jacket.

1190
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,987
-I've had it 1 0 fucking years.
-I'll get it.

1191
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:41,756
-Are you fucking crazy?
-We'll be downstairs.

1192
01:16:41,932 --> 01:16:43,957
Guy's fucking nuts.

1193
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,194
-You're bleeding.
-I am so sorry.

1194
01:16:47,371 --> 01:16:49,305
-Where?
-This is fucking insane.

1195
01:16:49,473 --> 01:16:51,498
-You are insane.
-I am so sorry.

1196
01:16:51,675 --> 01:16:53,506
If you wanna go back, I understand.

1197
01:16:53,677 --> 01:16:57,306
-You don't wanna talk?
-Yeah, I wanna talk. I mean....

1198
01:16:57,481 --> 01:16:59,881
Well, where?
Where do you wanna go?

1199
01:17:00,117 --> 01:17:02,381
My car's two blocks away
if you want coffee.

1200
01:17:02,552 --> 01:17:05,521
-Yeah, okay.
-All right. Okay.

1201
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:26,133
Look, you're probably not
gonna believe this at all...

1202
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:31,636
...but I was kind of glad
when I heard you were at the party.

1203
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,521
Ever since you and I broke up,
I've wanted...

1204
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:47,095
...to have a normal conversation,
just a normal conversation with you.

1205
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:51,665
And I just feel like every time
I see you, it just gets so, like....

1206
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:55,930
Like, weird and chaotic and scrambled,
and I can't organize my thoughts...

1207
01:17:56,105 --> 01:18:00,007
...and I can't even express the most
basic things I want to say to you.

1208
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,872
I know. Me too.

1209
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,949
Whatever we had when we were
together, when we were in love...

1210
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:13,282
...that feeling of just being able to lie in
bed with someone for days and days...

1211
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:16,425
...and not give a fuck
about the outside world...

1212
01:18:19,062 --> 01:18:21,530
...is gone.

1213
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:25,523
And I feel like there's nothing
I can do to ever get it back.

1214
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:28,726
Do you know how painful that is?

1215
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,272
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1216
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:33,466
I cried for weeks when we broke up.

1217
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,805
You cried for weeks?

1218
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:37,343
Yes.

1219
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:41,711
The hardest thing
I've ever dealt with in my life.

1220
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,151
How long did you go through that?

1221
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:51,951
A long time. A long time.

1222
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:57,224
I mean, the first month,
it was so fucking bad. And then...

1223
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:01,801
...you know, slowly, it gets better.

1224
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:06,772
That's the difference
between you and me, London.

1225
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,402
I'm still going through it.

1226
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:19,483
I tried to call you
a dozen times today.

1227
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,751
I'm terrified. I'm-- I'm afraid.

1228
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,654
Of what? What are you afraid of?

1229
01:19:24,827 --> 01:19:28,092
I'm afraid of falling in love
with you again.

1230
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:44,142
-Sorry, Syd.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,344
Yeah, man, you fucked
your eye up.

1232
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:50,110
Yeah, great party, mate.

1233
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,379
It was fucking insane.

1234
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:56,116
-But good chat, seriously.
-Definitely.

1235
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:59,318
You know, they say the greatest
conversation you'll ever have...

1236
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:02,055
-...is with a stranger?
-Who says that?

1237
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:03,630
Some useless cunt.

1238
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,527
You guys need a ride?
We can go uptown.

1239
01:20:08,004 --> 01:20:10,199
Me and Mallory....

1240
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:14,841
Don't know. We're gonna
catch a late drink...

1241
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:18,845
...cup of tea, something or other.

1242
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:20,949
Raise the flag, perhaps.

1243
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,051
Good luck. Thank you.

1244
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:26,819
That's it. Thank you, mate. Truly.

1245
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:37,264
London, lovely name, darling.

1246
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:38,763
-Thanks.
-Nice to meet you.

1247
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:40,868
-Have a safe flight.
-Nice to meet you.

1248
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:42,999
-Come by the bar, all right?
-I will.

1249
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,606
London, call me. Have a safe flight.

1250
01:20:45,775 --> 01:20:47,504
We're gonna catch a little drink.

1251
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:49,406
All right.

1252
01:21:05,628 --> 01:21:07,755
Can I ask you something?

1253
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:12,762
Yeah.

1254
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:15,366
You do love him?

1255
01:21:17,807 --> 01:21:19,638
I never said I was in love with him.

1256
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:23,944
Listen, Syd.

1257
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:28,483
It's gonna be a really,
really long time...

1258
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:31,484
...before, you know,
I fall in love with anybody...

1259
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:33,952
...the way that I was in love with you.

1260
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,583
What time is it?

1261
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:50,060
It's like 6:30.

1262
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:52,291
Six-thirty? Fuck. Shit.

1263
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:56,962
My plane leaves in like an hour.
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1264
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:02,063
I will see you again.

1265
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:05,470
I promise.

1266
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:11,212
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1267
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:15,414
I'm gonna miss you too.

1268
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,282
I gotta go.

1269
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,698
Sorry.

1270
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:43,137
-Hello.
-Hi.

1271
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:46,475
Sorry, I am-- I'm just really late.

1272
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:49,481
-I don't even know my flight number.
-That's all right.

1273
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,744
Just for one second, okay?

1274
01:24:53,956 --> 01:24:56,686
-Here's my lD.
-Thank you.

1275
01:24:56,859 --> 01:25:00,260
Just give me a few minutes
while I look for your information.

1276
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,821
Okay. Bye.

1277
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:05,967
Goodbye.

1278
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:27,853
Bye.

1279
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:29,684
Bye.

1280
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:33,294
Okay, miss,
I have your flight information.

1281
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,054
Sorry.

1282
01:25:35,397 --> 01:25:38,958
I think I might have missed my plane.
Can you make sure I'll be all right?

1283
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,761
London?

1284
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:43,798
I love you.

1285
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:51,771
-Can you give me a second, please?
-Sure. No problem.

1286
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:08,829
That's the first time you said it first.

1287
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,893
-Here you go. You're all set.
-Sorry.

1288
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:46,625
Okay.

1289
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,598
-So I'm set? Great.
-Yeah.

1290
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,102
-Here's your ticket.
-Thank you.

1291
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:54,265
-I'm not really sure where to go.
-Gate 35. Upstairs.

1292
01:26:54,443 --> 01:26:57,071
Thank you and have a great flight.
