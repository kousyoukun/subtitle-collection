00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,515
Attila! Where are you, boy?
Did you get that rabbit?

3
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,076
Did ya? l bet you did.
My mighty hunter.

4
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,237
You vicious killer.
That's my dog.

5
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,078
That's my beast.

6
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,918
Come on. Gimme a kiss.

7
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,359
Wait a minute.
Wait a damn minute.

8
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,677
Attila!
And you call yourself security?

9
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,709
Don't change the subject.

10
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,915
Love child
Love child

11
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,998
Hey, George.
Born of poverty

12
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,270
You gonna just stand there,
or you gonna help me with these boxes?

13
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,198
Now whattaya
got me carryin', huh?

14
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,788
l got a deal on solar panels
and batteries.

15
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,878
Well, l told you l wasn't doing
any more improvements on the house.

16
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,672
l'm sellin' this place someday.

17
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,199
Yeah, right.

18
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,753
But l see you improved
the garden anyway.

19
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,075
Yeah, and that goddam rabbit
still got in there.

20
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,754
l told you. He went
under your fence, George.

21
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,199
- He did not.
- He did too.

22
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,552
Look, l put that fence a foot
and a half underneath the ground.

23
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,875
Well, it's a mystery, George.

24
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,355
Anyway, this solar outfit...

25
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,516
is gonna save you money,
and it's free.

26
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,192
So, happy birthday.

27
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,959
Thanks, Nate. Thank you.

28
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,909
Who's gonna
put it together? Huh?

29
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,871
Not me.

30
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,672
lt comes with a manual
in three different languages.

31
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,837
- Forget it.
- Look, if it's a car, l can fix it.

32
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,712
lt's in the garden,
l probably can grow it, but--

33
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,114
This is way out
of my neighbourhood.

34
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,993
Hey, you, uh,
you bringin' a date tonight?

35
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,588
No. You?

36
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,631
Well, l'm thinkin'
of askin' somebody.

37
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,354
When? Today?

38
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,754
You don't give 'em
much notice, do ya?

39
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,996
Well, you even
ask anybody? Huh?

40
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,795
Always ask Diana Ross,
but she never says yes to me.

41
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,991
- See ya.
- See ya later.

42
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,271
But you're never, ever
gonna return

43
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,756
To ease the fire
that within me burns

44
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,395
lt keeps me cryin', baby,
for you

45
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,956
Keeps me sighin', baby, for you

46
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,234
So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me

47
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,316
- Come see about me
- Hey, Bill!

48
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,398
See about your baby
Come see about me

49
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,636
Hey, George. George!
l forgot to tell you, man.

50
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,238
Hold on. Hold on.

51
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,078
Doctor called.

52
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,236
Banes, will you
let me figure it out?

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,992
At 10-- At 10:00. At 10:00.

54
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,157
He want you que vayas
a su ventana at 10:00.

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,355
- He wants you to look at his window.
- Oh, man!

56
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,228
How ya doin', Lace?
You look great.

57
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,874
Yeah. How are
the chairs sellin'?

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,831
l got one left.
l need four more.

59
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,711
Wow. lt's going a lot better
than l expected.

60
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,910
Yeah, well, you know,
people sit down a lot around here.

61
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,075
Yeah.

62
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,395
- Here, l can get these.
- No, l got it. Thanks.

63
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,636
Well--

64
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,795
l'll help ya.

65
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,359
Hey, uh, Lace-- There's a-- There's
a party tonight at the Elkhorn Bar.

66
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,710
Why do they call it that?
There's no elk around here.

67
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,751
Well, l don't know. They've just
always called it the Elkhorn.

68
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,314
Why? They got some poor
elk's horn hanging over the bar?

69
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,590
l don't think so.

70
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,711
Anyway, it's
my birthday today, and...

71
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,876
there's a party tonight
at the Elkhorn.

72
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,353
- l said that, didn't l?
- Yep.

73
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,959
George!

74
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,072
- Oh! l gotta look up here at 10:00.
- Why?

75
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,997
Well, that's Doc Brunder's office.
Have you met him yet?

76
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,795
- No. What does he want?
- l don't know.

77
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,036
So, uh, hey, uh, you think, you think,
you could come to the party tonight?

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,071
No, l don't like to leave
my kids home alone at night.

79
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,872
- Well, l, l know a good
baby-sitter. Tito's wife.
- l just live really far out.

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,594
- You know, it's just really--
- You know Tito. Tito! Tito!

81
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,631
Hey, George.

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,273
Hey, that's nice.

83
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,079
Oh, God.

84
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,556
- So, that's the doctor, huh?
- Yep, that's the doctor.

85
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,999
Crazy doc.

86
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,515
- Would you please come tonight?
- No, not tonight.

87

Well, then l'll keep askin'.

97
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,470
lt's a scandal,

98
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,113

100
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,078

101
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,954
-No media. No press. Just-- Just heaven.
-Nothin'.

102
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,354
Hey, you're not supposed
to be buyin' drinks tonight.

103
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,356
Yeah.

104
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,674
- Jimmy!
- Yo!

105
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,631
George doesn't buy drinks tonight.
lt's his birthday.

106
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,672
- Hey. For you.
- Hey, Doc. Hey, you made it.

107
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,711
- Hey, Doc!

108
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,637
- Hey, shh! Shh!

109
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,751
- Doc, you gotta--
you gotta try that cake.
- Hey, you guys.

110
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,917
-Tito's wife made it. lt is macho bueno.
-As usual.

111
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,678
Come on. Open it, George.
Open it.

112
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,392
- Oh, Doc. Th-Thank you.
- Hey, Jimmy!

113
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,397
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

114
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,999
You're learning the moves, George,
but you've never played...

115
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,714
against turmoil and confusion,
so here we go.

116
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,274
l wish we could go back
to checkers. Maybe l could win.

117
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,755
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
You have potential, George.

118
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,758
l always said, ''George Malley has
something extra to offer this world.''

119
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,156
l said that the day l, uh,
circumcised you.

120
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,511
- He says that every birthday.
- lt was a bad joke, l know.

121
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,039
You know, you ruined my chance
of romance today...

122
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,639
with that obscene stunt
in the window.

123
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,035
- lt was an outrage.
lt was a disgrace.
- lt was a criminal act.

124
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,991
Okay, there was a beautiful girl
who walked right away from me.

125
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,235
lt was so embarrassing.

126
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,588
George, you talkin' about
the woman with the chairs?

127
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,596
Yeah.

128
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,438
Man, they are not
all that comfortable.

129
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,790
Well, l think they're perfect.
You gotta learn how to sit in 'em.

130
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,388
Ah, here you go.
On the house, everybody.

131
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,669
- All right.
- Jimmy. Jimmy.

132
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,199
There's no smoking section
in heaven.

133
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,151
Ah, don't start, Doc.
Don't start.

134
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,430
- George. George.
- Pass 'em out. Pass em' out.

135
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,994
- Hey, buddy.
- George.

136
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,950
We love ya, man.

137
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,433
- Y'all set?
- Yeah.

138
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,791
Great. This is great.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,470
Tito, wait, wait, wait. Tito!

140
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,160
Thanks for comin'

141
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,192
- Happy birthday, kid.
- Yup, happy birthday.

142
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,879
Yup, happy birthday.

143
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,790
Thirty-seven.

144
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,638
Thirty-seven.

145
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,915
Anybody see that?
Th-Th-- There was that light--

146
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,350
- What kind of light?
- Th-Th-Th-There was a noise.
D-D-D-Did ya hear it?

147
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,598
-No.
-Can we finish the game, George?

148
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,510
Man, it, it, it was like, like, like, an
explosion, and, and, and it was a flash!

149
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,519
- Like a plane?
- No. lt was bigger than that.
lt wa-wa-wa-was farther away.

150
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,359
Oh, you mean,
like a star, George?

151
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,516
Man, it knocked me off my feet.

152
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,074
- You fell?
- Yeah, l fell. l was--

153
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,630
The man's inebriated.

154
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,955
- l warned you.
- l am not drunk, Nate.

155
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,197
l'm taking your queen, George.
Now pay attention.

156
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,311
lsn't that checkmate?

157
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,591
That's checkmate, isn't it?

158
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,472
You mean he beat you?

159
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,716
You let him win, Doc?
Birthday present?

160
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,512
l didn't let him win anything.

161
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,995
You're a little pissed off
about that, aren't ya?

162
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,351
- Play another one?
- Y-Y-You can get your revenge
on me tomorrow, all right?

163
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,277
- You feeling okay?
- Yep.

164
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,277
- Can you drive, George?
- Yeah, l'm all right.

165
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,233
Hey, thanks, everybody.

166
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,715
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Happy birthday, George.

167
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,558
That was a good party.

168
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,549
Oh, l can't sleep.

169
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,235
That's it!

170
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,230
- What?
- l figured it out.

171
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,318
Jesus, George, what are you
doing calling me? lt's late.

172
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,590
l thought that farmers got up
when it was still dark?

173
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,874
That's if you have cows.
l don't have any cows, George.

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,594
Now look. There's only one
explanation for that rabbit.

175
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,948
What?

176
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,957
You see, when l built
that fence higher and deeper,

177
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,354
he was already in there.

178
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,314
See, he was hiding.
l fenced him in.

179
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,831
- There's only one thing l
can do now. Just let him out.
- Good night, George.

180
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,359
Good night.

181
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,389
- Here's Roger.
- George, can l have my Bronco back?

182
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,875
l don't have any cash right now,
but l need my car.

183
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,798
Well, l need some solar panels
installed on my roof.

184
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,673
- l don't know
anything about solar.
- Well, Charlie Shipper does,

185
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,075
and, uh, he needs a well
dug on his property.

186
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,272
You help him dig the well, he'll help me
with the panels, and l'll fix your car.

187
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,868
Deal?

188
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,672
Yeah, deal.

189
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,112
l'll, uh, l'll call Charlie.

190
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,913
Hi. l just called
about, uh, fixin' my brakes.

191
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,792
Oh, yeah, yeah. l'll be right
with ya. Uh, Tito--

192
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,716
- Come on.
- Tito, he speaks Spanish
better than l do now.

193
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,513
Yeah, better than me too.

194
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,677
All right. Where's the owner
and operator of this vehicle?

195
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,837
- You a cop?
- Our mom's in the store.

196
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,430
- Mm-hmm. You got the brake on, sport?
- His name's Al.

197
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,312
- And what's your name?
- Glory.

198
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,669
Well, l'm George.
Pop the hood, Al.

199
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,359
Why?

200
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,959
You know how
to start this thing?

201
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,229
Duh.

202
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,029
Ah! Emergency
road service, ma'am.

203
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,593
Your truck can't breathe
and your idle's too fast.

204
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,314
Mmm, sorry. Gotta go.

205
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,000
Where? You're not, uh,
leavin' town, are ya?

206
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,076
No, just San Francisco,
for the day.

207
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,998
Oh, l used to live there. Uh, a-a-ask,
ask me directions on where you're goin'.

208
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,156
As a matter of fact,
ask me anything at all.

209
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,395
You could even ask me
to come along.

210
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,351
l'd show you the sights,
hazards. Whattaya think?

211
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,119
l think your idle's too fast.

212
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,470
San Francisco, huh?
But you were born here, right?

213
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,831
- How did you know l was born here?
- Just now, in the store. Someone said:

214
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,757
''l've known George Malley all my life,

215
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,668
and if he said he saw a UFO,
he saw one''.

216
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,552
l didn't say that.

217
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,752
- You saw one?
- But l didn't say what l saw.

218
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,632
What'd it look like?

219
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,512
Well, it could've been.

220
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,514
That's 'mate, Doc.

221
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,551
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, George!

222
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,434
Now, what in the hell
is goin' on here? What?

223
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,074
Look, you know, l don't know,
Doc. l-l-l really don't.

224
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,351
Just lately l've been, been
seeing things so clearly, you know?

225
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,950
And, uh, you know, uh,
l understand right away.

226
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,073
l concentrate. And books.
l can't stop feeding myself.

227
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,760
l read two, two, three books a day.
lmagine that.

228
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,318
And-And-And uh, you know, l can't stop
and l, l, can't sleep ever since the--

229
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,233
l-l-- l gotta go.
Get back to work.

230
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,113
Ever since the sighting.

231
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,358
- Roger, it was a damn light!
- And a boom.

232
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,833
Now, did you hear it?

233
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,875
Well, no. Anybody?
About nine days ago, right outside here?

234
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,959
Was that 12:00, George?

235
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,514
George, come in for a physical, okay?

236
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,319
George?
Two or three books a day?

237
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,510
- At least.
- About what?

238
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,189
About everything. You know,
all the things l've wanted
to know about and learn.

239
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,958
Like what?

240
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,877
You tell me, Rog.

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,798
l mean, what have you always wanted
to know about and learn? Hmm?

242
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,916
Think about it.

243
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,035
l'm waiting for ignition

244
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,993
l'm looking for a spark

245
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,989
Any chance collision
and l light up in the dark

246
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,680
Such a mass of motion

247
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,394
Do not know where it goes

248
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,229
l move with the movement and

249
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,509
l have the touch

250
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,316
Any social occasion

251
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,238
lt's hello, how do you do

252
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,033
All those introductions

253
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,469
l never miss my cue

254
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,955
So before a question

255
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,197
So before a doubt

256
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,312
My hand moves out and

257
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,317
l have the touch

258
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,474
Lonely, only
wanting contact with you

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,355
Shake those hands

260
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,119
Shake those hands

261
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,037
Shake hands

262
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,599
Shake hands

263
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,151
l have the touch

264
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,390
CQ, this is W-B-6-Q-L-F
standing by.

265
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,035
Searcher out of Harmon, California.
ls anybody in the void tonight?

266
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,278
l'm lookin' for Diana Ross, but l'll
accept any voice in the English tongue.

267
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,519
ls that you, Diana?

268
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,469
- Hey, George.
- Now look, Nate.

269
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,751
You haven't sat until
you put your ass on one of
these home-made willow chairs. Okay?

270
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,950
Now l bought you a pair
so you could put your feet up.

271
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,437
Or, if you, uh, want a friend
to sit in there, if you decide
one day to invite someone over.

272
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,788
Whattaya think?

273
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,229
- l don't think they go, George
- Oh, what would you know?

274
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,555
Looks like a swap meet
blew in here.

275
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,956
Talk about needin' a woman's touch.
This is an emergency.

276
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,789
Hey, Nate. l've been workin'
on that solar kit you gave me.

277
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,232
l'm tellin' you, the whole field of
photovoltaics is, is just in babyland.

278
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,432
l mean, you know, th-the idea
that plants have been storing...

279
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,791
and, and using the sun's energy
since the birth of the world.

280
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,388
l mean, photosynthesis is,
is a model for us,

281
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,876
and, and we're just scratching
the surface of what we can do
with these silicon cells.

282
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,389
l'm tellin' ya. What?

283
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,799
What?

284
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,912
You just talk so fast, George,
and, and you know so much stuff.

285
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,192
l'm sorry.
l can't help it, Nate.

286
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,197
lt's okay.

287
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,038
- What is that?
- Oh, it's just computers
talking to computers.

288
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,230
Shh. Leave it,
leave it, leave it.

289
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,669
Ah, come on. The Morse code's
goin' too fast for you to pick that out.

290
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,155
No, no, no, no. lt's-- lt's--
l can hear it.

291
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,714
- Bull.
- No, l'll tell ya what it is.
A repeated pattern.

292
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,671
They're looping a message.

293
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,555
- ''Watering the golds F-Friday.''
- Yeah, yeah.

294
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,797
Now who'd be sending a coded message
like that in simple Morse?

295
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,639
Oh, man, look. l pick up like
two different air force bases.

296
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,512
l think we better
leave this one alone, George.

297
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,108
Mm, no, no. This is
a different one. Listen, listen.

298
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,516
This one's much denser, but it's still
a loop; it still repeats. Listen.

299
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,118
- Seriously, l think we--
- Oh, l gotta record this.

300
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,912
- l think we need to leave this alone.
- Hey, where's your--

301
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,871
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What are you doin'?

302
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,798
Well, l want to take it home
so l can break it down,
and then we can answer it.

303
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,753
- Why?
- Because it gives me
something to do, Nate.

304
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,788
l don't know if it's getting worse
or it's gettin' better, but--

305
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,798
You know, l have 12 hours
in the night to kill, and l--

306
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,357
When l get tired of reading,
l do crossword puzzles,
but they're all too simple.

307
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,472
Too simple?

308
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,558
And then everybody l know is asleep,
and l'm, l'm awake at night.

309
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,114
ls there something, um,
something l could do?

310
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,630
Hey! Why don't we
just go outside and box?

311
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,832
l could split your lip again.
You'll-- Ya-- You'll feel a lot better.

312
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,188
No!

313
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,076
Hey, if you send a message,
would they get it?

314
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,395
Yeah, sure. Um--

315
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,192
Send this. Send them...

316
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,880
''Don't, uh-- Don't overwater
the golds.'' Say that.

317
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,912
- Okay, fine. The golds?
- Marigolds.
- Oh, yeah.

318
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,555
No, no, no. Say:
''Don't overwater the marigolds Friday.''

319
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,240
''Don't overwater...

320
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,716
- the marigolds on Friday.''
- Right.

321
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,035
- ''We'll be watching.''
- Yeah, yeah. We'll be watching.
- How does that sound?

322
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,355
Oh, my God. This is cool.

323
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,276
lt's okay, Attila. lt's nothing.
Static electricity, that's all.

324
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,675
That's all it is.

325
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,310
See, here. Here you go.

326
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,591
Okay. All right. Okay.

327
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,519
Oh, God.

328
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,598
Oh, God! Oh, man!

329
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,236
ls somebody trying
to tell me something? Huh?

330
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,310
What?

331
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,796
- Did ya pee in the cup?
- Yep.

332
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,673
- Still having trouble sleeping?
- Yep. Any ideas?

333
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,599
How long you been
feeling this way?

334
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,438
You know how long
l've been feeling this way.

335
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,190
Everybody does. lt's been
over a month since my birthday.

336
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,788
Notice anything else, or--

337
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,957
- Yeah.
- What?

338
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,915
- Well, watch your fountain pen there.
- Whattaya mean?

339
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,717
- lt's telekinesis.
- Yeah.

340
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,079
ls that okay?

341
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,990
Do it again. Do it again.

342
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,876
You know, l consider myself
a rational man. A man of science.

343
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,597
You know, open to whatever.
But, uh, l feel like a child, George.

344
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,280
- l feel scared.
- Me too.

345
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,117
Well, whatever the reason is,
l promise you we'll find it. Okay?

346
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,071
Now, let me see you
do that one more time.

347
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,431
lt's a monster, George.

348
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,236
Yep, yep. This old Frankenstein here
gets 90 miles to the gallon on methane,

349
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,955
and it's made from my garbage
and Nate's pig manure.

350
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,152
- Special blend.
- Sure smells like it.

351
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,591
See, Georgie.

352
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,119
- Hello, Lace.
- Hey. These are a little bit different.

353
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,835
- l used a little bit
of a wider branch on these.
- Yeah, they look great.

354
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,949
George, are these yours?

355
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,036
Yeah, yeah. l've been
working on some, uh,

356
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,798
special organic fertilizers.

357
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,797
- Go ahead. Taste it.
- Mmm.

358
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,639
No, no, no. Bite into it
like a, like an apple.

359
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,196
You got some on your chin. Sorry.

360
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,197
Maybe, uh, maybe
the kids would like some?

361
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,515
- lt's great. Thanks.
- No, no, no. Wait. Wait.

362
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,959
Let me pick some out for you.

363
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,308
lf the kids like them, you know,

364
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,874
y-y-you could make anything.

365
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,877
You could make a sauce or a soup.

366
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,479
George, l thought you were smart.

367
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,477
Hey, what she got, anyway?

368
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,955
Yeah, yeah,
besides uncomfortable chairs.

369
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,718
My heart, amigos. My heart.

370
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,070
Jump in, let's go

371
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,192
Lay back, enjoy the show

372
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,395
Jump in, let's go

373
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,271
These are the days
when anything goes

374
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,710
Every day is a winding road

375
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,275
l get a little bit closer

376
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,029
Every day is a faded sign

377
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,030
- l get a little bit closer
- Hey, George! Where do you
think you're goin'?

378
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,515
- To feelin' fine
- You guys going home?

379
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,959
You want a ride?

380
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,752
- Okay.
- Glory!

381
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,350
- Oh, what?
- Glory, come on.

382
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,438
- Would you come on?
- All right.

383
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,232
- Al!
- Okay.

384
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,920
Hurry. Hurry up!

385
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,672
Jump in, let's go

386
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,997
These are the days
when anything goes

387
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,513
Every day is a winding road
l'm feelin' fine

388
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,154
- Are those for our mom?
- Yep.

389
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,030
l thought flowers were for dates.

390
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,632
- Don't get spooky, Al.
- Did she invite you?

391
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,878
Hey, wait a minute!

392
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,309
Blue. l don't have blue.

393
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,797
Every day is a winding road

394
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,188
- Every day is a winding road
- Oh, great.

395
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,631
- You guys know the name
of this, uh, this flower?
- No.
- No.

396
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,830
A Delphinium belladonna.

397
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,110
That's the Ranunculaceae family.

398
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,673
l didn't always know
the names of flowers,

399
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,475
but it seems, recently, that l can
pretty much name any flower l see.

400
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,639
- Mmm.
- Yeah. Like this one
is Lamonium Sabbatom.

401
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,352
And, uh, this is the, uh--

402
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,239
Doesn't make them
any prettier though.

403
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,992
ls that a garbage bag tie?

404
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,715
Yeah. l was improvising.

405
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,592
Hey, now, that's a good idea.

406
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,555
Ah, that's much better.

407
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,749
Yep.

408
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,233
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

409
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,952
Every day is a winding road

410
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,430
Every day is a winding road

411
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,957
My mom's around back!

412
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,676
Every day is a winding road

413
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,791
Lace?

414
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,515
- Hi.
- Hi.

415
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,551
Now, you didn't nearly
take enough tomatoes,

416
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,558
and l'm very proud of them.

417
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,275
Well, there you go. And, uh--

418
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,630
l got you these.

419
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,832
Well, that's every wildflower
from my, my house to your house.

420
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,234
Your kids helped.

421
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,510
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

422
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,791
- Hey, what are ya workin' on?
- Nah, nothin'.

423
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,876
Nothing.

424
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,276
Wow, that's, that's really great work.
Look at this.

425
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,756
- Beautiful.
- Ah, you want to, um, walk?

426
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,871
Sure.

427
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,276
- Shh.
- l-l-l gotta tell ya,
you know, you got great kids.

428
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,551
Yeah, they are great kids, but you
don't really know that yet, George,

429
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,717
because you don't know them,
and you don't know me.

430
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,673
-Well, uh, l'm tryin' to get to know ya.
-l know.

431
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,155
l-- l really want to keep
my life very simple.

432
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,669
Even predictable.
That's why l moved here.

433
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,870
l don't like surprises,
and l don't like complications.

434
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,473
What happened to you, Lace?

435
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,153
Ah, l'm sorry.
Th-That's none of my business.

436
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,952
- No, no. That's okay.
- l'm stupid.

437
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,119
- l'm so sorry.
- So let me ask you something, George.

438
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,516
When a man comes over with a basketful
of tomatoes, what is he expecting?

439
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,395
- Dinner?
- No, no, no. Just hoping.

440
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,991
Trifolium?

441
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,079
Y-Y-You don't have any purple
in those flowers l got you, do ya?

442
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,919
Whoa. D-D-Did ya feel that?

443
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,712
Feel what?

444
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,558
Whoa.

445
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,431
W-W-Well, come here.
Come here. That's it.

446
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,039
Okay.

447
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,311
- Feel that. Right there.
- Feel what?

448
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,551
Oh, God. l think
l know what this is.

449
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,159
- What?
- C-C-Could l use your phone?

450
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,272
Yeah.

451
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,595
Okay, yeah.

452
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,917
Just east of Harmon.
You know which one l'm talking about?

453
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,600
No, l-l was told to call you,
and l'm telling you right now...

454
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,472
that l picked up
on some activity.

455
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,031
No, we didn't use
any instrumentation.

456
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,391
No, l don't have a degree
and l haven't studied anywhere,
but l'm just tryin' t--

457
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,433
Are you shutting me down here?
ls that what's going on?
Are you trying to shut me down?

458
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,597
Look l'm just tryin' to tell you
that l felt the compression waves, okay?

459
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,029
ULF. Ultra-low frequency waves.
Now, now, they have...

460
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,435
the ability to make you
nauseous and dizzy. Am l right?

461
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,312
Okay, well, that's what l felt!

462
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,635
And-- And l'm tryin' to tell you
that, that l think that there--

463
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,112
There's an earthquake coming.

464
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,989
Um, listen, Al. Why don't you put
some masking tape on the cupboards?

465
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,714
And, Glory, bring
the vases down and the china.

466
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,233
This is good, Lace.

467
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,073
- l think you're a good cook.
- No, l'm not.

468
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,591
l only make two things pretty well.
Pork chops and, um, turkey.

469
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,630
Which is this?

470
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,156
l'm just--

471
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,874
Look!

472
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,754
- Al.
- Hmm.

473
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,632
- Oh, you.
- l was just joking.

474
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,797
Oh, please.

475
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,990
Oh, you scared me.

476
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,878
Not funny.

477
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,678
Thanks.

478
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,315
- All right. Can l say it now?
- What's that?

479
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,590
- You've got great kids.
- Oh, thanks.

480
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,676
- And l thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.

481
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,633
- And good night.
- Good night.

482
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,557
Good night.

483
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,792
- Shh. She's coming.
- Tell her.

484
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,956
- No, you tell her.
- Shh.

485
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,798
- Shh.
- Come on.

486
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,235
- He's neat.
- Yeah, he's nice, isn't he?

487
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,670
Yeah, but he thinks he saw a UFO and
he thinks he can predict earthquakes.

488
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,552
There may be a warning here.

489
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,592
- But he never said
for sure it was a UFO.
- Yeah.

490
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,756
Oh, Jesus! Doorway! Doorway!

491
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,348
Let's get in the truck.
Get in the truck.

492
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,789
- lt's over, Mom.
- l know it's over. Let's go. Now.

493
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,876
Did you feel it, huh?

494
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,036
Did you get scared, huh?

495
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,799
Do you realize
the possibilities of this, huh?

496
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,672
Do you know what this means?

497
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,357
You felt it, didn't you?

498
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,072
- You did!
- What is going on, George?

499
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,395
- Wasn't that amazing?
- Tell me what's happening.

500
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,080
l don't know. l don't--
l don't know.

501
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,350
l need the simple truth, George.

502
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,870
This is the truth. W-W-W-What's
happening to me i-i-is the truth.

503
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,958
Oh, no.

504
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,994
Lace.

505
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,234
l love those chairs, Lace.
l love them. l didn't--

506
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,309
Y-You made them. Okay?
All right?

507
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,592
l wanted to see you, okay?
l mean--

508
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,836
Bring them back to the shop tomorrow.
l'll give you your money back.

509
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,154
l don't want
my money back, Lace.

510
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,111
l just asked you
for one thing, George.

511
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,391
The truth.
And you couldn't handle it.

512
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,550
- George, haven't you called her yet?
- Never mind about that, will ya?

513
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,079
N-N-Now this is the second one.
Gladiolus. Remember that.

514
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,758
How do you know
she's still mad at you?

515
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,359
l know. Now, all right.

516
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,436
- Write her a note.
- No, no, no. l found this.

517
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,391
Classic five-bed garden pattern. Here.

518
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,988
Flowers. You should send
her flowers or candies.

519
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,350
Yeah. Marigolds, gladiolus,
roses, etcetera.

520
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,277
And l went to the library...

521
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,836
and l looked up the missile silo pattern
at the Masterson Air Force Base,

522
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,155
and l made my, my own overlay.

523
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,113
And here we go. There.

524
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,198
- Yeah.
- See, that, that's their,
that's their garden.

525
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,072
You see? Well, that's old stuff.

526
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,758
lt's, uh, and it's, uh,
declassified.

527
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,359
But now this stuff is trickier.

528
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,552
This is, uh, trigraphs
and tetragraphs and ABBA class.

529
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,749
- George--
- Yep?

530
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,871
Why don't you just tell me
what you want me to send?

531
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,798
All right. Send this.
Why don't you send this?

532
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,434
''Mind your garden. Frost coming.
Luck on the Mozop.''

533
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,152
Want to know what Mozop is?

534
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,475
lt's okay.
lt's your game, George.

535
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,636
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have you sat in this chair yet?

536
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,034
- lt's nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

537
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,229
You should give her
a call right now.

538
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,750
Naw. Let her cool off.

539
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,235
l figure l'll give her 'bout a year.

540
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,113
Pick up the phone and call her, George.

541
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,037
Look who's talkin'.

542
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,391
Diana Ross fan club, right? Have
you said ten words to a woman this year?

543
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,477
- Ah, l'm sorry, Nate.
- Your transmission's finished, sir.

544
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,831
l've just been going
through some things lately.

545
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,837
Everybody's going through somethin'.

546
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,748
l know, but, uh, this thing's
been hard for me to handle.

547
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,914
Let me show you somethin'.

548
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,076
You suppose they magnetized you?

549
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,476
l don't know, buddy. l wish l did.

550
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,557
- What we got here?
- Doc, are we glad to see you.
You better hurry. This man--

551
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,953
One of you go to the garbage and
bring me any food containers you find.

552
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,710
Somebody else, go in the cabinets
and look for damaged or swollen cans.

553
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,115
- Food poisoning.
- l think.

554
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,470
Now what the hell is he saying?
Who speaks Spanish?

555
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,955
That's Portuguese.
They just came in last week.

556
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,638
Portuguese?

557
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,357
He's trying to tell us
something about Berto.

558
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,118
That's the little one.
lt's a little boy.

559
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,037
All right, some of you
search around here for the kid.

560
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,628
l'm gonna tell you right now,
he could be pretty darn sick.

561
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,716
Now, Bonnie, wait. Uh--

562
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,956
Get on the phone
and get George Malley over here.

563
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,470
Tell him what's goin' on, and
tell him to stop at the library
for an English/Portuguese book.

564
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,559
Tell him to find out how to ask
where a lost boy is.

565
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,875
- Got that?
- George Malley?

566
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,195
You bet. George.

567
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,719
Go on. Do it. Just go on. Go on!

568
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,352
Don't you answer that?

569
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,471
Not when l'm workin'.

570
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,275
l've been farmin' all my life,
but this growth is amazing, George.

571
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,599
-This is embarrassin'.
-You know, l wanna try this
fertilizer on your south 40.

572
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,711
You just sprayed my boots.

573
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,114
lt's the worst soil in the county.

574
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,356
Can't even get weeds
to grow in that field.

575
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,072
But l bet we can get corn
to grow in that field.

576
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,317
You bet? You don't have
any money to bet.

577
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,158
You spent all your money
on chairs, remember?

578
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,113
George Malley?

579
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,437
- Yeah, l'm George Malley.
- l'm John Ringold.

580
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,391
We talked on the phone the other day.

581
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,635
- John Ringold?
- Yes.

582
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,113
- From Berkeley?
- Yes.

583
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,437
All right. Hi. Hey,
l'm glad you came by.

584
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,710
- Will your dog let me step out?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

585
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,400
Well, he just has a thing
for seismologists.

586
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,476
- Yeah, come on out.
- Thank you.

587
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,113
Yeah, this is
my friend, Nate Pope.

588
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,992
- How do?
- How do you do?

589
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,792
W-W-Well, let me get you
a cold drink. Come on in.

590
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,638
- From the university, huh?
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

591
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,637
And, uh, we are
very interested in how...

592
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,513
you were able to predict
that earthquake, Mr Malley.

593
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,517
Oh, that.

594
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,791
You see, l, l, just picked up
the subsonic frequency waves, right?

595
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,480
And, of course, l was standing
on the fault, so that made it easier.

596
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,990
- W-W-What instrumentation did you use?
- Just me.

597
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,078
lf you think that's somethin',
you should see him
move stuff with his brain.

598
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,159
Nate, never mind that. You see,
l felt the ultra-low frequency waves,

599
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,635
and they kind of made me
dizzy and nauseous, right?

600
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,034
And that's how
l perceived all this.

601
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,119
We've been studying quake prediction
for ten years.

602
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,994
There's no record of any person
ever feeling the pre-quake activity.

603
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,997
Now there is.

604
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,071
We have some ULF equipment
in our labs.

605
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,792
Could you come in
for an experiment?

606
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,229
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.

607
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,271
Yes.

608
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,039
Well, my department would like
to interview you and clear this up.

609
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,118
l-l-l would be-- l would be
so glad to come to Berkeley.

610
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,073
Do you-- Do you think l could meet
w-w-with some other departments as well?

611
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,953
l-l-l have some experiments l'd,
l'd like to show you. Come with me.

612
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,995
They're nice.

613
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,476
All right. Well, uh, let's see.

614
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,388
Um-- Oh, oh, yes.
Here. Okay, now look, um--

615
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,512
l've taken solar panels, and
l've actually germinated the seeds...

616
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,631
t-that made these,
these, these plants grow.

617
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,478
l'm trying to change
the electromagnetic field, right?

618
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,558
- Um, Mr Malley?
- l took, uh, incandescent lighting,

619
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,954
- Mr Malley?
- and l turned it into sunlight,

620
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,116
which actually made
these, these plants grow.

621
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,276
- Mr Malley?
- Oh, now, look--

622
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,870
l-l took pig manure,
and l turned it into a f-fuel...

623
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,513
which l-l believe
will actually run an automobile.

624
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,676
All l'm interested in
is the earthquake.

625
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,193
We need to know if
that was a fluke, a coincidence.

626
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,834
A fluke?

627
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,428
George, why don't you
move something with your mind?

628
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,069
Maybe move his, uh,
something like that?

629
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,112
- Look, Mr Ringold--
- Doctor.

630
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,994
D-D-Doctor Ringold, uh,
l-l-- Look, l--

631
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,873
l've got-- l've got my garden out there,
and t-t-that acts like a lab, right?

632
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,070
And l, l got everything
that you see here, but l--

633
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,316
- l really need to talk
to people like you, okay?
- Hey, George!

634
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,398
- George, are you home?
- Please don't go, okay?

635
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,909
- George, get out here!
- Please-- Just please don't go.

636
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,679
Hey, George!

637
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,995
George, Doc says,
you better come right now!

638
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,155
What's the matter?

639
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,316
Come on, man.
lt's an emergency!

640
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,431
You gotta learn how to talk Portuguese
on the way over there.

641
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,915
l gotta go.

642
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,191
Portuguese? Learn Portuguese?

643
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,158
Why don't you go along, Professor?

644
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,157
George, Doc's inside.
He thinks it's food poisoning.

645
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,714
Hey, George.

646
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,958
- Hey, Doc. George is here.
- He's gonna be fine, George,
but his grandson is missing.

647
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,310
Now, if they ate the same thing,
the boy could be a lot worse off.

648
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,589
You brought the book?

649
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,994
- Yeah, l have it.
- All right. Okay.

650
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,111
Ask him where the boy is?

651
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,592
He's in orchard.
He said he's in the orchard.

652
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,869
All right. Okay.

653
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,198
He said that they ate something bad,
and he thinks the b-- the boy is sick.

654
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,594
Tito drove the truck
while l-l read the book.

655
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,475
George Malley. You learned
the Portuguese language in 20 minutes?

656
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,273
Not all of it.

657
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,233
- What are we lookin' for here, a kid?
- What's the kid's name?

658
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,150
- lt's Alberto. Berto, Alberto, yeah.
- Alberto? Alberto.

659
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,829
Now, let-- let's spread out
and comb these-- comb these trees.
Everybody, let's go.

660
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,598
- Okay.
- Look real careful.
- Alberto!

661
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,199
Call out his name.

662
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,153
- Alberto!
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

663
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,477
- Alberto!
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

664
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,239
- Berto!
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

665
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,838
- Where are you, kid?
- Alberto, where are you, fella?
We're comin'.

666
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,837
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

667
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,593
- Berto!
- Berto!

668
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,676
No, nothin' over here!

669
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,800
George, whatcha got!

670
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,036
Huh? What?

671
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,957
- He's not in the orchard.
- Huh?

672
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,832
He's sick, Doc.

673
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,552
- He's there.
- Where is he, George? Where?

674
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,671
- Over here.
- Okay. Let's go.

675
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,314
We're with you.
We're with you.

676
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,152
What's goin' on?

677
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,796
You okay, George?

678
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,354
lt's not me. lt's him.

679
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,199
Tell me where he is.

680
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,835
l don't know. l don't know.

681
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,638
Look! There's a ladder under there!

682
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,310
Come on.

683
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,954
He was right!

684
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,877
He's up here!

685
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,072
Doc! Better get up here fast.

686
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,997
Good work, George.

687
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,314
- So, is, uh, Wednesday
good for you? Say 2:00?
- Sure. Wednesday's good.

688
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,874
-Should l send a car?
-No, no, John. l'll get there on my own.

689
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,275
And, and l'll, l'll have somebody
from solar energy there.

690
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,551
And, uh, anything else?

691
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,036
Yeah, automotive. Hey, d-d-d-do you have
an agricultural school at Berkeley?

692
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,277
- Yeah.
- Well, how 'bout for my fertilizer?

693
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,118
l'll take care of it.

694
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,639
Hey, George.

695
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,470
That's the little boy's mom.

696
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,556
She's the only one
who talks English, l think.

697
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,875
Oh, it's too bad
she wasn't here earlier, huh?

698
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,675
Yeah. But l guess
she had to look for work, man.

699
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,677
l want you to meet
a very special guy.

700
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,792
This is the-- This is the man
who, who found your son, okay?

701
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,150
Very special.
This is George Malley.

702
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,477
- This is Ella.
- Hello.

703
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,349
- Thank you.
- lt's okay.

704
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,870
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

705
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,150
l'll take you
to the hospital, okay?

706
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,838
Thanks, George.

707
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,236
- Way to go, patron.
- Do you know what kind of work
she was looking for?

708
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,079
Hmm, cook, l think they say.
Housekeeper.

709
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,518
You know somebody who's looking?

710
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,994
- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.

711
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,509
l found a housekeeper for you.
A Portuguese woman.

712
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,870
She cooks too.
l think she's perfect for you.

713
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,797
l don't know if l could
eat Portuguese food, George.

714
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,911
Well, she'll cook ya
anything you want, Nate,

715
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,316
and she'll try to make sense of
that so-called house that you live in.

716
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,193
- She speak English?
- Well, a bit, but, uh--

717
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,390
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna work on your Portuguese.

718
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,988
- Me?
- Yeah! You got a problem with that?

719
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,237
No, no. lt's, uh-- l don't know
if that's gonna work, George.

720
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,999
All right, Well, let's try it.
What do you wanna say?

721
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,592
How 'bout, uh,
something like, um, um--

722
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,076
- Can you come twice a week?
- Okay. Can you come twice a week?

723
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,918
Okay. Can you come twice a week?

724
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,630
That sounds complicated, George.

725
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,673
Oh, no. You got your tape recorder, and,
and, uh, you'll learn it phonetically.

726
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,030
No problem. What else?

727
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,958
Uh, how much per day?

728
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,833
How much per-- Oh, okay, good.
How much per day?

729
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,072
- l like that one.
- Yeah? Yeah.
- That was nice. Okay. Okay.
- What else?

730
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,193
Um, ah--
Can you start next week?

731
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,232
- Perfect. Logical, right? Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

732
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,839
Can you start next week?

733
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,428
Beautiful language, huh?

734
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,596
- That's it?
- Yep. Work on those.

735
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,797
You know, George,
l might be pretty good at Portuguese.

736
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,629
No-- Oh, never mind.
We'll get used to 'em.

737
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,228
lf you leave them alone,
they'll leave you alone.

738
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,237
lt's a good arrangement.

739
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,920
- What are we reading?
- This.

740
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,837
What is this?
Where did you get this?

741
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,590
- From me.
- This is not a good choice for bedtime.

742
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,393
- Are you still mad at him?
- What's the difference?

743
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,080
He's neat, and they say...

744
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,634
he saved that boy's life
at the orchard.

745
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,034
He's funny.

746
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,720
We are funny enough.
We laugh all the time.

747
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,991
Look, we're reading Black Beauty,
and we are not talking about men.

748
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,715
l've got enough to worry about.
Too much.

749
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,479
- What?
- Well, you guys, for one.

750
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,272
We're not little any more.

751
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,197
l know you're not
little any more, sweetie,

752
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,029
but you think that George Malley
is safe, and you're afraid of coyotes.

753
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,835
You've got it all backwards.
Here. Find our place.

754
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,349
Go brush your teeth.
l'll be right back.

755
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,516
- Don't you have a report to do?
- Did it.

756
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,196
''They're everywhere--''
Oh, Al. Do you really believe this?

757
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,357
Yeah. There's been a lot of UFO people
coming into town...

758
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,553
since George saw what he saw.

759
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,319
- The word's spreading, Ma.
- You just believe
what you wanna believe.

760
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,635
Most people do.
You get over it.

761
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,076
- Hey, l thought we were
getting ready for bed.
- No.

762
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,197
- Stop talking about him, all right?
- Why do you hate him?

763
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,118
- 'Cause l like him.
- Told you.

764
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,071
Told you.

765
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,875
But if he was sitting here with us
right now, wouldn't you be watching him,

766
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,753
wondering, ''What's he thinking?''

767
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,996
''When's he gonna leave?''

768
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,873
''ls he gonna leave?'' Hmm?

769
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,192
We don't need that.

770
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,678
lt's okay. Shh.

771
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,797
l heard he took 20 minutes.

772
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,309
Twenty minutes, he read
the whole damn book, knew Portuguese.

773
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,079
- You were there. He was too!
- And then he went
running around in the orchard.

774
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,316
Shh. Here he comes. Here he comes.

775
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,234
- Hey, George.
- Hello.

776
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,319
- Hi.
- Hi.

777
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,992
- So, George. How did you
feel that earthquake comin'?
- Voices tell ya?

778
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,351
- Voices? Hell no.
- What else do you know, George?

779
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,713
Well, l know you're on
the outs with Lisa again.

780
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,831
- How did you know that?
- Well, 'cause when
she's livin' with you,

781
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,871
she makes sure
your clothes match.

782
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,752
Poor Banes.

783
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,518
Do you get messages, George?

784
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,074
Yeah, well, yeah, uh,
when Paulette delivers the mail l do.

785
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,395
But, uh, today
s-she was two hours late.

786
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,556
l think we oughta
do something about that.

787
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,591
Complain or somethin'.

788
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,233
Earthquake, earthquake. Can we--

789
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,032
Well, it-- You know, Jimmy,
it was just, uh--

790
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,310
l was out by Ash Creek,
and l felt some vibrations. That's all.

791
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,192
How'd you know where to find
the boy in that orchard?

792
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,912
Well, l don't know, Bonnie.
l mean, come on.

793
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,359
Do you know what's going to happen?

794
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,390
Roger, come on!

795
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,397
l'm sorry, l'm--

796
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,875
They say at the library
you read four books a day now.

797
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,991
Yeah, well, that was
last week and, uh--

798
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,630
Ah, l-l better go.

799
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,637
How many languages do you speak now?

800
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,273
Excusez-moi, Jimmy.

801
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,949
Huh? lf anything bad was
gonna happen, you'd tell us,

802
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,476
won't ya?

803
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,749
Hey!

804
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,675
Uh-huh.

805
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,792
- Okay. l'll be back. All right.
- All right.

806
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,956
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

807
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,798
Okay, thanks.

808
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,418
- Hi, Lace.
- Hello.

809
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,933
l'm sorry l lied to you
about the chairs.

810
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:42,495
l-- l just wanted you to come
to my shop so, so you would talk to me,

811
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,415
instead of, um, instead of
always walking away from me.

812
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,815
What do you want, George?

813
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,857
l want you to come
to Berkeley with me.

814
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,858
l-l-l've been invited
to talk to, uh, some scientists...

815
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,938
about the earthquake thing
and about some of my, my experiments.

816
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,972
You know, the, the fertilizer
and the solar panels and--

817
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:08,173
- That's really nice.
- l'm excited, but l--

818
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,053
l guess l'm scared too.

819
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,331
- l sure would like you there with me.
- What for?

820
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:19,136
Support. Confidence. A friend.

821
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,809
You've got friends. You know
everyone in the whole area code.

822
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,613
l don't know, you know,
since that orchard thing, it's--

823
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,538
People are different now.
They're-- l don't like it.

824
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,618
You know, the funny thing is,
is that you're probably the only one...

825
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,812
that, that, that, that, that's mad at me
for a good reason.

826
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,053
You're just trying to make up.

827
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:46,059
Yes, l'm trying to make up with you,
l am tryin' to get a date with you,

828
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:51,129
and l would love it if you stood
by me while all those scientists
and teachers asked me questions.

829
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,854
You know, l-l-l spent
half of school in detention.

830
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,412
When?

831
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,259
- Wednesday.
- What time?

832
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:06,500
- Leave about noon.
- l'll be outside your shop
at noon, if l'm coming.

833
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,895
And if l'm not there--

834
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,409
Okay.

835
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,292
Thanks, Lace.

836
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,779
Touch me in the morning

837
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,216
Then just walk away

838
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,933
- We don't have tomorrow
- Uh, one second.

839
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,528
One second. Here l come.

840
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,933
You are Mister Pope?

841
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,858
You are Mister Pope?

842
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,971
l am Michaela.

843
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,570
M-Mich-Ella. Hmm.

844
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,656
- You're Ella?
- Yes.

845
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,014
Wow. Oh, l'm--
l'm sorry. Please.

846
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,530
Oh. Um, maybe you need to--

847
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,493
Yes, this is the place.

848
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,090
- l cook too. You need cooking?
- Cookin', yeah.

849
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,451
Good. Fine. Good.
Uh, how much you pay?

850
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,649
Uh--

851
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,098
Oh, wait, um--

852
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,571
l-l-l s-s-speak
a little Portuguese.

853
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,531
l don't know what you just said,
but it sounded great.

854
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,173
- Um--
- Sorry.

855
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:47,249
Okay. Uh, tomorrow
l come back. 9:00. Okay?

856
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,610
l work, and we talk about money.

857
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,732
No, wait.

858
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,093
That's all l really know.

859
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,211
That and, um--

860
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,134
ls that right?

861
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,138
You're cute.

862
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,017
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

863
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,011
Tomorrow, then.

864
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,458
CQ. CQ?

865
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,459
This is W-B-6-Q-L-F.

866
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,368
Diana, if you can hear me,

867
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,209
l know you'll understand this.

868
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,568
l just met...

869
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,374
an angel from Portugal.

870
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,208
Here. ln my house.

871
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,054
You George Malley?

872
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,375
Jack Hatch, FBl.

873
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,334
Nate Pope sent a coded message
to Masterson Air Force Base.

874
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,896
No, no, no, no.
Nate-- Nate Pope did not send
a coded message to the air force base.

875
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:48,330
- l-l did.
- Well, who taught you
the cipher, Mr Malley?

876
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,974
Nobody. l just broke,
broke the code.

877
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,931
Who trained you?

878
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,652
As l said, nobody, l--

879
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,016
Oh, man.

880
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,414
Mm-hmm.

881
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,209
Well?

882
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,053
Can't do it.

883
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,219
- You can do it, Mr Malley.
- Too complex.

884
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,778
We're releasing Nathan Pope.

885
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,657
lt's about time.
Can l talk to him?

886
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,099
No.

887
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,857
Try this one.

888
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,211
You know, i-it was just
a game, okay? l mean, a game.

889
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:49,935
You caused the cancellation
of a top secret training
exercise, Mr Malley.

890
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,813
The scrapping of
an entire cipher system.

891
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:56,137
You cost the government
a lot of money.

892
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,535
So bill me.

893
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,852
l think he's what
he says he is, a fluke.

894
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,052
He's an independent,
playing some kind of genius games.

895
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,455
l want him tested.

896
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,696
- Can't keep holdin' him.
- Yes, we can.

897
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,414
- He resisted arrest.
- No, he didn't.

898
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,098
Yes, he did.

899
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,539
Test him.

900
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,811
All right, l'll start the questions,

901
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:36,728
and l'll be timing your responses.

902
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,613
And we'll be recording. Any questions?

903
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,571
What's your first name?

904
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,452
Uh, my first name is Bob.

905
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,969
- Hi.
- Shoot, Bob.

906
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,692
Right.

907
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:53,415
Name as many mammals
as you can in sixty seconds.

908
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,337
Ready. Go.

909
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:00,136
Hmm. Sixty seconds. Well, how would
you like that? How about alphabetical?

910
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,932
Aardvark, baboon, caribou,

911
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,813
dolphin, eohippus, fox,
gorilla, hyena, ibex, jackal,

912
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,613
kangaroo, lion, marmoset,
Newfoundland, ocelot, panda,

913
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,211
rat, sloth, tiger, unicorn,
varmint, whale, yak, zebra.

914
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,969
Now, varmint is a stretch.
So is Newfoundland. That's a dog breed.

915
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,056
Unicorn is mythical.
Eohippus is prehistoric.

916
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,250
But you weren't being
very specific now, were you, Bob?

917
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,810
Well,

918
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,330
l'll-- l'll try to be more specific.

919
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,691
- You ready for the next one?
- Shoot.

920
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:40,099
Answer as quickly as you can.
How old is a person born in 1928?

921
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,176
Man or woman?

922
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,814
- Why?
- Specifics, Bob.

923
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:49,693
Okay, one more time.

924
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,892
How old is a man born in 1928?

925
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,135
Still alive?

926
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,175
lf a man is born in 1928,

927
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,575
and he's still alive, how old is he?

928
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,849
What month?

929
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:12,729
lf a man was born
October 3, 1928,

930
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:14,816
and he's still alive, how old is he?

931
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,410
- What time?
- 10:00.

932
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,893
- P.M.
- Where?

933
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,773
- Anywhere!
- Well, let's get specific, Bob.

934
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,094
l mean, if the guy's still alive,

935
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,212
born in California,
October 3, 1928, 10:00 p.m.,

936
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,854
he's 67 years, 9 months, 22 days,

937
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,574
14 hours and-- and 12 minutes.

938
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,612
lf he's born in New York,
he's three hours older now, isn't he?

939
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,219
How do you do that?

940
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,336
How do-- How do you
make that pencil move?

941
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,610
ls that a trick pencil?

942
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,652
No. l ask it to move.

943
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:09,900
l mean, l could say that l will it,
but that would be more like a command.

944
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:14,059
This is more like a collaboration,
a partnership.

945
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,694
- Partnership?
- Mm-hmm.

946
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:19,380
- With a pencil?
- Well, why not?

947
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,173
We're all made up
of the same stuff, aren't we?

948
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:28,019
- Wood?
- Energy, Bob.

949
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,290
- You know, the little pieces.
- Right.

950
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:34,413
l want to go home.
How the hell can l get home, Bob?

951
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,250
l don't know. Sorry.

952
01:05:58,700 --> 01:05:59,769
Hey.

953
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:05,251
- They say you haven't slept.
- Mmm.

954
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:09,692
Who's that? My keepers?
l'm all right.

955
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,730
You know, you're
a pretty gifted man, Mr Malley.

956
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:17,819
No, no, really.
We were hopin'--

957
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,453
Well, l was kind of hopin'...

958
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,538
that you might find something
that you enjoy doin'.

959
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:25,254
Something useful in our world.

960
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:27,974
- Your world?
- lntelligence.

961
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:32,218
Ah, no, no, no, no.
lt's home for me, Jack.

962
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:34,774
l'm jumpin' out
of my skin here.

963
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,176
l mean, l want my life.
l want my life.

964
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,892
- What do you want?
- lt's not what l want.

965
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,614
What do they want?

966
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:51,938
They want to feel safe.
They don't feel safe with you out there.

967
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:57,214
W-W-W-Why would they? They've having me
break codes all night. Secret codes.

968
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,730
l mean, there-- l shouldn't be listening
to a code from Britain to Saudi Arabia.

969
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:04,409
l mean, these are our allies. lf-if you
guys are gonna accuse me of a crime...

970
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,930
or keep me here, l'll tell the press.

971
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,177
Or l'll call London or Riyadh.

972
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,292
l know all the, uh,
capitals now, by the way.

973
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,888
You can test me.

974
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:21,218
My interest in Mr Malley has
to do with seismology and geology.

975
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,013
lt has nothing to do
with security issues.

976
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,858
Oh, l know,
but that's not the point.

977
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:30,815
Mr Malley has been released
without charges, but he is
considered a security risk.

978
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,374
l'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.

979
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,412
And we'd feel better
for the time being...

980
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,656
if he wasn't granted
any access to the institutions...

981
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,055
where sensitive government projects
are in the works.

982
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,411
- Access?
- Access even to personnel.

983
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,577
- Lace?
- Ohh.

984
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,418
lt's-- lt's me.

985
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,292
- Hi.
- Hi.
- l'm sorry l didn't--

986
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,980
l didn't come through the front door,
but l was so afraid l'd wake the kids.

987
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,250
Oh, that's okay, that's okay.

988
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,416
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

989
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,929
l wanted to see ya.

990
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:16,496
Nate told me about the FBl.
l'm so glad they let you go.

991
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:21,216
Yeah, well, they had no choice, but
they, they are watching me so closely.

992
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,137
l think l scare them.

993
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,372
You scare me too.

994
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,572
l do? Hmm.

995
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,175
Listen, George, this is
getting really complicated.

996
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:43,576
l just, uh-- l just don't know
what's going to happen next.

997
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,494
l should probably
leave you alone, shouldn't l?

998
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,933
l guess so.

999
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,573
l'll see ya.

1000
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,094
Bye.

1001
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,134
Hey.

1002
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,535
- You want a beer, George?
- Yep.

1003
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:34,297
Look, Nate--

1004
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,571
l am really sorry
for what happened, okay?

1005
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,897
l told them everything, George.

1006
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,739
l told them
everything about you.

1007
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,179
Everything.

1008
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,768
Well, you know, that's
supposed to happen, okay?

1009
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,972
- l mean, you know, it's, uh--
- You just think you're
not going to be so scared,

1010
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:55,093
and you're sittin' there--
you don't know what's gonna happen,
then all of a sudden...

1011
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,859
somethin' happens inside you, right?

1012
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,891
And you don't know what it is, but--

1013
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,693
lt's all right.
l-l-lt was my game, you know?

1014
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,658
What'd they do to you, George?

1015
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,098
They tested me.

1016
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:17,495
What did they find out?

1017
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,731
- l'm pregnant. That's how it feels.
- How what feels?

1018
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,057
Yeah, you know, to be full of ideas
and you can't deliver, okay?

1019
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,933
l mean, you know, you're ready
to break out and you can't deliver.

1020
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,778
You know, uh, this professor,
he won't even talk to me.

1021
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:34,255
He won't even talk to me.

1022
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,848
- You're not going to Berkeley, George?
- Oh, come on. Me, at Berkeley?

1023
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:40,939
- That's a thought, huh?
- l'm sorry, buddy.

1024
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,857
You mean, inventions?
You got inventions?

1025
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,814
No, no. ldeas, okay? l get a thousand
ideas a day, every d-damn minute. Okay?

1026
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:51,138
l got big, big, ''holy cow''
kind of ideas and, and little
''what if'' ideas. All right?

1027
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,251
Hey, l got ideas for you, Jimmy.
Look at this.

1028
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,177
Look at this. Your parking lot--
it's laid out all wrong, okay?

1029
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,211
Now, if you just
follow this, right,

1030
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,377
you can put six more cars in and
nobody gets fender benders. All right?

1031
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,732
Where's Paulette?
Where is she? Bonnie, here. Take this.
This is a new route for our mail. Okay?

1032
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,851
Now, if she does this,
she can save an hour a day...

1033
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,335
and everybody gets their mail
by 3:00. lmagine, 3:00.

1034
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,974
Oh, and l got a ''holy shit'' idea too.
Look at this.

1035
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,331
Now this may be the most efficient way
to store solar energy. Okay? Take it.

1036
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,975
- Well, what am l gonna do with it?
- What the hell am l supposed
to do with it, huh?

1037
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,056
You know what that light was?
You know what that sound was?

1038
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,932
-Tell us.
-l'm gonna tell you what it was.
-Well, tell us!

1039
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,369
- lt was a damn alien.
- Don't say that.
You don't know what it was.

1040
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,889
- l know what it is, Nate.
- You don't know what it was.
Don't say that.

1041
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,375
- Well, tell us!
- lt's a goddam mistake,
is what it is!

1042
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:35,415
Okay? lt was supposed
to happen to someone smart, someone
scientific, someone who's a leader.

1043
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,008
But it didn't. lt happened
to me, George freakin' Malley.

1044
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,256
Look at him. Now look at him. Look!

1045
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,649
Jimmy?

1046
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,531
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1047
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,888
- l'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.

1048
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,615
- l-l-l'll pay for it.
- All right.

1049
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:03,619
Bonnie. Bonnie, please.
l-l-lt's ok--

1050
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,408
Oh, man.

1051
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,933
Mm-hmm.

1052
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,459
Okay.

1053
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,332
Who was that? Customer?

1054
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,737
lt's Banes.
Says he can't work here no more.

1055
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:32,010
Sorry.

1056
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,335
Why didn't he talk to me?

1057
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,451
- A little bit scared, l guess.
- Jesus Christ.

1058
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,094
Look, George, it'll wear off.

1059
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,734
They'll forget.
Their cars are gonna break down--

1060
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,612
- Hi.
- Hey, Doc.

1061
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,968
Hi.

1062
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,091
- Energy vibrations. What is it?
- l don't know.

1063
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,893
- T-- Telekinesis? What? What?
- Yeah, maybe. Uh, maybe, yeah.

1064
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,248
You think it's gettin' out of hand?

1065
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,972
Well, look, you know,
l was, l was mad, all right?

1066
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,136
l was pissed off,
and l'm not mad now, okay?

1067
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:02,219
Good. l'll sound the all-clear,
call off the paratroopers.

1068
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:05,059
Jesus, George. Now, listen.

1069
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,138
- You owe me a CAT scan.
l want more blood.
- Mm-hmm.

1070
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,297
- Also, you look like hell.
- Ah, that's good.

1071
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,217
Doc, what's the matter
with everybody?

1072
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,092
They won't give me a chance
to explain anything.

1073
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,494
l look at them--
l look at them, and they--

1074
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,180
they look at me like
l'm a green bug or something.

1075
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,416
- Give them some time, George.
- Now, look, l have an idea.

1076
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,337
Now, you look at this.
Now, look at this.

1077
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,532
Now, now, look at that. Now, l-l-l'm
a big deal at the Harmon Library.

1078
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,379
l can, l can take up to 30 books
a night, okay, and l told them
l'd be part of this.

1079
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,456
l said that l-l-l would put out
a table and...

1080
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,536
- Your pressure is way up now.
- and l would sit there and
people could ask me questions.

1081
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,776
You know, meet George Malley.
What do you think?

1082
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,697
Uh, like a circus attraction.

1083
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,253
Oh, God, Doc, please.

1084
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,052
- Yeah.
- You know, l, uh--

1085
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,091
You see, l c-c-can explain
to them once and for all.

1086
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,892
l-l could share
my ideas with them,

1087
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,817
you know, and then l-l-l
could get my life back together.

1088
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:49,852
Come see me for that scan.
Take it easy on sugar and salt.

1089
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:54,656
Okay? And do like l told you all your
life. Breathe in and out. Okay, George?

1090
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:56,657
Yeah.

1091
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,571
- Come on. Give it!
- No.

1092
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,339
- Give it. Come on!
- No!
- You're not careful. You'll break it.

1093
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,735
- Al, what do ya got there?
- Please, l just wanna look at it.

1094
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,373
Hey. That's dangerous, sweetie.

1095
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,139
- He bought it.
- What?

1096
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,739
lt's a piece of
the mirror George broke.

1097
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,179
Richard Smick is
selling them at school.

1098
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,450
- Oh, you're kidding.
- lt's hot! Feel it.

1099
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,457
lt's not hot.

1100
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,538
Richard said the aliens probably
took George Malley away...

1101
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:48,015
and put this man in his place.

1102
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,938
- This man?
- Like he's not human.

1103
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:53,449
That's really dumb,
and it's really mean.

1104
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:00,017
Can't they just look in his eyes
and see who he is? Can't you?

1105
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:03,689
Do you remember, when daddy left,
how people treated us differently?

1106
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,288
Even our so-called friends.

1107
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:11,172
Remember how much it hurt?
You don't do that to people.

1108
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,099
How much you pay for that?

1109
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,690
- A quarter.
- A dollar.
- What's the truth, Al?

1110
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:24,132
l paid a dollar.
l was gonna check it with my magnets.

1111
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,375
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1112
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,014
Do you see something
really strange in there?

1113
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,051
- What?
- What?

1114
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,932
A sucker.

1115
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,095
- No.
- You paid a dollar for nothing.

1116
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,336
- You're a goner.
- Nice job, Al.

1117
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,459
Hmm.

1118
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,973
Lace.

1119
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,374
Hi.

1120
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:12,134
Hi.

1121
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,932
l just-- l just called you.

1122
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:19,019
- You did?
- Mmm. Come in, come in.

1123
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:28,054
l'm so, so glad you came.

1124
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,171
Well, l was just--

1125
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,894
W-Why-- Why were you calling?

1126
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,773
l found some things out, Lace.

1127
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,892
Things, uh, are coming clearer to me.

1128
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,739
Or, at least,
they're, they're starting to.

1129
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,579
- Things?
- Mmm.

1130
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,816
l wanna talk to the people, Lace.

1131
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,056
l-l don't want them to be scared of me
or, or frightened.

1132
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:54,015
l-- l mean, l wanna,
l wanna tell them what l know.

1133
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:56,859
So l've, l've decided
to speak at the library fair.

1134
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,253
Do-- Do you think that
they'll listen to me?

1135
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,497
What would they do, throw stones?

1136
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:11,698
Oh, my God, please sit down.
l can't believe this.

1137
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,050
Would you like something
to drink? A beer.

1138
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:17,092
- No.
- What? What can l get you?

1139
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,332
Scissors.

1140
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:24,657
l can hear her heart beat

1141
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:28,568
From a thousand miles

1142
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:34,650
And the heavens open up
every time she smiles

1143
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:42,215
And when l come to her
that is where l belong

1144
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:49,052
And l'm runnin' through her
like a river song

1145
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:55,892
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1146
01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:02,334
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1147
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:10,812
She's got a fine sense of humour
when l'm feelin' low down

1148
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:15,889
And l'm comin' to her
when the sun goes down

1149
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:24,651
Take away my troubles
Oh, take away my grief

1150
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:30,491
Take away my heartaches
in the night like a thief

1151
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:37,492
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1152
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:45,698
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1153
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:50,177
And l need her in the daytime

1154
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:53,053
l need her

1155
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:57,059
And l need her in the night

1156
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:59,455
l need her

1157
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:04,779
And l wanna throw
my arms around her

1158
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,130
- Have you done this before?
- And kiss and hug her
- Nope.

1159
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,775
- Hmm.
- And kiss and hug her tight

1160
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:20,374
- Up or down.
- When l'm returning
- Down.

1161
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,333
From so far away

1162
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:26,736
Give me some sweet lovin'

1163
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:30,739
lt brightens up my day

1164
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,328
And it makes me righteous

1165
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:36,975
And it makes me whole

1166
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:43,414
And it makes me mellow
right down to my soul

1167
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:50,332
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1168
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:57,775
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1169
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,255
ls it close enough?

1170
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:02,808
You tell me.

1171
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:08,414
You give me love
Give me love

1172
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:11,452
- Crazy love
- Uh, it's pretty close.

1173
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:18,213
Love, love, love,
love, crazy love

1174
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:24,415
You give me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1175
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,091
You're running away?

1176
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:35,338
Are you comin' back?

1177
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:42,649
Hmm.

1178
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,258
Hope so.

1179
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,892
- Okay, George?
- Huh-huh.

1180
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,056
Oh, hi, Doc.

1181
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:31,092
- Welcome.
- Do you improve your mind
with all this reading?

1182
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,017
Yes, Doc.

1183
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:35,096
Lady Chatterly's Lover?

1184
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:40,252
Yeah, well-- All right, well,
you know, that's kind of, uh--

1185
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:43,292
that's kind of a code book for anyone
who, uh, wants to understand...

1186
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,217
a woman's heart and mind.

1187
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:49,219
- l read it twice.
- Ah, George, can you, uh--

1188
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,412
can you name the presidents
forwards and backwards for these people?

1189
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:55,930
No, but l can name some, uh, forward
presidents and some backward ones.

1190
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:00,574
You know, l-l can really only tell you
what l've read in these books and, uh--

1191
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:05,296
- He looks better.
- Yeah, yeah he does.
- you know, things l'm thinking about.

1192
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:08,173
l seem to have an increased capacity
for, for learning right now.

1193
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:12,896
- How do we know
you read all these books?
- Well, um, ask me something.

1194
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,410
Uh, l'd be, l'll be glad to answer
any question that you have, or a--

1195
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:21,011
How did you break that mirror, George,
without even touching it?

1196
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,290
Now, l wanna talk
to you about that, Banes,

1197
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,935
because l know, l know
you've been worried about it, and, um--

1198
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:29,779
Okay, come here. Come here.
Everybody gather closely.

1199
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,777
l'm gonna-- May l use your glasses?

1200
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:36,018
What you're about to see
is not a trick.

1201
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:39,655
Okay? lt-- lt's just, um--
Well l-l-let's call it
an experiment in energy.

1202
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,657
- Oh!
- Cool.

1203
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,452
- Well, everything there is...
- Are you getting this?

1204
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,889
is made up of
some living energy, okay?

1205
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:50,616
See, now, all this is is a-- is kind
of a dance, or a partnership between...

1206
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:54,335
the energy coming from me
and the, uh, energy of the plastic.

1207
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:57,372
- Now, now, tha-tha-that's it, see.
- Well, why can't we do it?

1208
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,971
Well, focus, um, the clarity
of thought. l-l don't know.

1209
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,328
M-May-Maybe you can, Banes.

1210
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:05,291
What about the UFOs?
What are they?

1211
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,969
- l don't know that either.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do!

1212
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:13,013
Um, this power began the night
that you saw the object in the sky?

1213
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,368
T-T-That was a light.

1214
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,491
Now, now, let me, let me
just finish this one thing.

1215
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:18,611
Now, now, we were talking
about a partnership.

1216
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:23,450
Now, do you, do you know what the
largest living organism in the world is?

1217
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:27,812
Okay, it's a-- it's a grove of aspen
trees in Colorado. Acres of aspens.

1218
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,329
Okay, now, they thought
they were disconnected, separate,

1219
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,098
but indeed they found out
that they weren't,

1220
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:35,576
that, that there was one giant organism
with the same root system.

1221
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,612
What sort of light was it?

1222
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,890
- Now, that-that's not unlike us.
- Answer the question!

1223
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:43,136
- We, we think that we're disconnected,
- Why won't you tell us what
you know about the UFOs?

1224
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,013
- Can you move a table?
- but, you know, we're--
- How did you feel
when you saw that light?

1225
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:49,257
- l think you know more
than you're telling us.
- We're not. Now imagine--
imagine, if you will--

1226
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,531
Have you seen the light since
the 28th, or any other activity?

1227
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,128
- Are you hiding something?
- Hey, hey. Hey, come on!

1228
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,535
- Just put your hands on my boy.
- lt was aliens. Admit it!

1229
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,730
- Move the glasses some more.
- Can you bend spoons?

1230
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,010
- Now, we all know what you can do.
- Hey, leave George alone.

1231
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:06,019
- Why won't you touch the boy?
- Please, he's dying. Just do it.

1232
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,732
George! George!

1233
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:16,976
George? George, can you see me?

1234
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,739
George. George, are you okay?

1235
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,696
Mr Malley? Are you all right?

1236
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:13,689
- You look sorrowful.
- No.

1237
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:17,733
What's the matter? Can't think
of any more tests to give me?

1238
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:21,694
How did you, uh, manage to get
your pressure to come down?

1239
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,539
Oh, l found my pace.

1240
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,457
A simple thing, really.

1241
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,856
- Hard to explain.
- What, you figure l'm too thick?

1242
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:32,574
What l figure about you...

1243
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,339
is that you're stalling.

1244
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:39,419
l'm not stalling, no.
l'm-l'm waiting.

1245
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:42,896
- For what?
- Reinforcements.

1246
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:54,059
Well, you pick good people.

1247
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,932
You bet.

1248
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,052
See--

1249
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,018
George. George.

1250
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:09,337
There's a tumor in your brain...

1251
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,337
that's spread out like a hand.

1252
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,530
Threads of it, you know, everywhere.

1253
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:16,538
But instead of dysfunction--
Now, here's the mystery, George.

1254
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:20,539
lnstead of destroying
brain function,

1255
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:25,017
so far it's been stimulating it,
and we can't understand that.

1256
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:29,691
You have more area of active brain use
than anybody ever tested, ever,

1257
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,936
b-because of those tentacles.

1258
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,857
l mean, we've seen tumors
like this before.

1259
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:41,568
lt's called astrocytoma, and
it explains, uh, the dizziness and...

1260
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,089
the illusion of light.

1261
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:47,451
But the way it's in there,
waking up areas of the brain,

1262
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,298
it's a...

1263
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,460
big mystery, so--

1264
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,776
And it's killing me.

1265
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,219
- Well, uh--
- For sure?

1266
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,217
We got a call from
the best brain man in the country.

1267
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,615
l mean, actually,
he's one of the best in the world.

1268
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:11,449
- He's gonna study your tests
and then talk to you.
- Hmm.

1269
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:15,937
But, uh, the blood flow
is in danger now,

1270
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,893
and, uh, you're gonna
start to weaken, maybe...

1271
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:23,134
black out.

1272
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:28,812
We, we really don't know. lt's, it's--
But it's a damn lousy scenario, you see.

1273
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,933
Let me sit down here a minute.

1274
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,656
Goddam it.

1275
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,331
Something happened
about 25 years ago...

1276
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,894
when you broke your leg
and l set it, George.

1277
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,693
l don't know what to call it,
but, uh,

1278
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:56,132
somehow you got into
my heart more than most,

1279
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,012
and for--

1280
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,895
and for a man
who's never been a father,

1281
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,011
l sure feel like
l'm losin' a son.

1282
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,212
Yeah.

1283
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:13,495
Georgie.

1284
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,973
Yeah.

1285
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:23,816
Can l do something for you,
George? Anything?

1286
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:29,060
Yes. Next spring,
when you plant the south 40,

1287
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,978
l want you to use
the new fertilizer.

1288
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,330
- l want you to put corn in that field,
and l know what you're thinking--
- l can't put corn in there.

1289
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:37,770
You're thinking that
it's too tough a crop, but it's not.

1290
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:42,018
l'm telling you. You'll get
four to five years without rotation.

1291
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,131
Now, trust me on this.

1292
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,012
Hey.

1293
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:51,456
- l'm gonna wait outside.
- Okay.

1294
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,730
Doc, you wanna come with me?

1295
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,612
Yeah.

1296
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,252
Bye, Doc.

1297
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:13,530
Now, uh, he didn't say how long.

1298
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:21,418
Days or weeks.
They don't-- They don't know.

1299
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:24,298
l'm so sorry, Lace.

1300
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,252
l know how you hate surprises.

1301
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:33,254
l tried so hard not to love you.

1302
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:35,257
- How'd you make out?
- Terrible.

1303
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:43,852
Hey, would you, uh,
love me the rest of my life?

1304
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,768
No, l'm gonna love you
for the rest of mine.

1305
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:14,856
George Malley?
l'm Dr Wellin.

1306
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,178
George, l'm recording this because...

1307
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,088
l'm going to be asking you
some very important questions.

1308
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:24,893
- You ready?
- Not another test?

1309
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:28,057
No. No, no. No more tests.

1310
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:31,809
A dialogue.

1311
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:36,775
l'm going to ask for your permission for
my team to perform open brain surgery.

1312
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:40,495
But l don't want you to answer
'til we've had our dialogue, all right?

1313
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:43,214
Bu-But you s-s-said that
this tumor was inoperable.

1314
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:47,492
l think the odds are very small,
say one in five hundred,

1315
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:50,771
that we'd be able to remove enough
of the tumor to even prolong your life.

1316
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:54,017
- Well, why, why--
- But, but what l want to explain is...

1317
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:58,338
that this would not be
a lifesaving operation.

1318
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:00,212
This would be--

1319
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:03,371
Call it an expedition.

1320
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:08,575
This would be
a voyage of discovery.

1321
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,692
You're in a position to contribute
as much to our knowledge...

1322
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:14,129
as any man or woman
who's come before you.

1323
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,811
And if you were
to wait, and, uh,

1324
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:22,376
do this operation after l'm done
with my brain, what, what would, uh--

1325
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:26,254
lf that's what you want,
yes, an autopsy, that's all we'll do.

1326
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,654
But it wouldn't be as useful?

1327
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:32,092
The study of a living,
active brain would tell us volumes.

1328
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,619
All right, so if you were
to do this operation,

1329
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:36,971
wouldn't it most likely kill me
or at least shorten my life?

1330
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:42,493
-George, l-l'm asking you to try
and see the larger picture.
-Mm-hmm.

1331
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:47,455
To realize what you have to offer to us,
the ones you're leaving behind.

1332
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:51,971
You could be
our greatest teacher, George. Hmm?

1333
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:55,536
l can be your biographer,
in a sense.

1334
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:58,220
l can present you to the world.

1335
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:02,538
But that's not me.
That's just my brain. Do you understand?

1336
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:06,733
Look, Doctor, you know,
l just might have something
to say in my last few hours.

1337
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:09,294
l-l just might have
something to say.

1338
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:11,980
What you're saying is that
l have something to teach,

1339
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,376
and yet you're willing to end me
to study my brain under a microscope.

1340
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,570
- N-Now, is that all l'm here for?
- What else?

1341
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:19,691
- You're not a scholar or a think--
- l-l-l'll tell you what l am, okay?

1342
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:21,299
l'll tell you what l think l am.

1343
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:22,739
l think l'm what everybody can be.

1344
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:24,578
Everyone with
a malignant, tentacled--

1345
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:28,852
No, no, no, no. lt's-- lt's--
Tha-tha-that just helped me
get here, okay?

1346
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:30,254
l mean, anybody can get here.

1347
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:35,010
lt's-- l'm-- l'm
the possibility, all right?

1348
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:37,779
l mean, l think you've got this
desperate grasp on, uh, technology...

1349
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:41,973
and this grasp on science, and,
uh, you don't have a-a hand left
to grasp what's important.

1350
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,897
- George. Now, George--
- lf l had to choose between
a tumor that got me here...

1351
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,296
and some flash of light from
an alien craft, l'd choose the tumor.

1352
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:49,536
l would, because
it's here, within us.

1353
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:52,174
What l'm talking about
is the human spirit.

1354
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:56,816
That's the challenge. That's the voyage.
That's the expedition.

1355
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,615
You need to go now.

1356
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:06,779
l need my rest,
and, uh, l wanna go home.

1357
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:28,776
Hey, hey, hey. l tried to release
my patient. Now, what's going on?

1358
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:30,253
- lt's done
- What's done?
- We didn't feel...

1359
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:32,689
George Malley was
competent to make the decision.

1360
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,617
He's a surgical patient now.

1361
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:37,095
Oh, what did you tell the judge?
That you could save him?

1362
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:39,131
l might prolong his life, yes.

1363
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:40,488
Bullshit.

1364
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,576
lf he were rational, he'd say yes.

1365
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,292
You know he would.

1366
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:46,456
Now l know why you guys wear masks.

1367
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,529
Yeah, if it was light enough,
he could've been blowing
on it with his breath.

1368
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:56,378
You know, he could
have had a string.

1369
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:59,776
So thin, you know, like, uh, catgut.

1370
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,892
l mean, he could've had it
on his finger and on the glasses
and he could have made it move that way.

1371
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:06,854
Don't you think he, he could've
uh, thrown s-somethin'
at that mirror somehow?

1372
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,130
- We-We just didn't see it?
- No way.

1373
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,455
That quake could've
been a coincidence.

1374
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:15,129
He just thought he knew stuff.
l mean s-s-- he just studied
harder on the Spanish.

1375
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:17,569
That's all. lt's not like
he really knew stuff.

1376
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:21,375
Just studied hard at chess
and made us think he was changin', but--

1377
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,252
You know, he never
really changed at all.

1378
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,859
Ain't that right, Doc?

1379
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:28,131
l mean, he never
really got any smarter.

1380
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:29,613
Doc?

1381
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,776
Banes?

1382
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,293
How's your lady love?

1383
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:38,649
We, uh, we broke up.

1384
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:41,852
Oh, really? That's too bad.

1385
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:45,973
Yeah. Now, George, he's got a love at
his side, and she's stickin' with him.

1386
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,649
You know why?
Because he bought her chairs.

1387
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:52,738
That's pretty smart to me.

1388
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:55,374
You ever buy Lisa's chairs?

1389
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,139
God, Doc's really drunk tonight. God.

1390
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:04,130
Every woman has her chairs, something
she needs to put herself into, Banes.

1391
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:07,377
You ever figure out what
Lisa's chairs were and buy 'em?

1392
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:12,179
Nope.

1393
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:13,813
But you're right about one thing.

1394
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:17,933
George never changed.
Never. No, never.

1395
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,536
Doc's makin' no sense tonight.

1396
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:25,616
Yeah. Maybe he
caught it from George.

1397
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,370
- Now, goddam it, Doc!
- Why do you have to tear him down?

1398
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,934
What are you so afraid of?
What have you got to lose?

1399
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:36,132
He wasn't selling anything.
He didn't want anything from anybody!

1400
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:40,378
He wanted nothing from nobody.
Nothing! Nothing!

1401
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:47,450
And you people have to tear him down
so you can sleep better tonight?

1402
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:52,529
So you can prove that the world is flat
and sleep better tonight. Am l right?

1403
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:00,979
l'm right.

1404
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,335
To hell with all of you.
To hell with every one of you.

1405
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:21,652
Hey, George. How ya doin'?
There ya go.

1406
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:23,372
- Drink up.
- All right.

1407
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,694
Good job.

1408
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:33,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't take
the pudding. That's the good part.

1409
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,409
Hey, is Cal around?

1410
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:35,939
Sure. You wanna see him?

1411
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,255
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

1412
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:04,849
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, man.

1413
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:05,969
- How's it goin'?
- All right.

1414
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,294
Can you stay for a few minutes?

1415
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:09,138
Sure.

1416
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:11,979
- Saved you some pudding again.
- Oh, what a buddy.

1417
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,818
l love this stuff.

1418
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,728
Night, dude.

1419
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:36,977
Hey, Doc. You seen him?

1420
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,533
- Seen who? What?
- George Malley. He's out.

1421
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:40,969
He sneaked out.
We're lookin' all over for him.

1422
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,056
- He's out?
- Yeah, he flew the coop.

1423
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:45,296
Nobody knows where he is.
l heard it on the radio.

1424
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,571
Flew the coop. Those FBl guys are
gonna have me drivin' around all night.

1425
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:50,019
lf l gonna be home late again--

1426
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,294
l want you to take these
and give them to Doc.

1427
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:04,139
These l'm taking with me
because l haven't finished them yet.

1428
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:05,978
They're for Doctor Ringold.

1429
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,735
This l wrote for you, Nate.

1430
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,816
lt's-- lt's about soils, and, uh,

1431
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,498
some of my own thoughts.

1432
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:14,338
- Your thoughts?
- Yeah.

1433
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:18,892
- l could drive you, George.
- No. No, Nate, it's too chancy.

1434
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:22,851
You can make it, man.

1435
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:24,698
- Nate.
- George.

1436
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,379
L.

1437
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:57,412
Oh.

1438
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:59,815
Oh.

1439
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:14,333
l'll get it.

1440
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:16,178
Now you put the top on it.

1441
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,173
Attaboy.

1442
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:25,016
- Leave me alone.
- Do it, Al.

1443
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,728
That tight enough?

1444
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:34,055
Why don't you do it once more?

1445
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,413
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1446
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,015
There you go.

1447
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,176
Good. Now you fixed it.

1448
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:53,814
What?

1449
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:59,092
You came here to die, didn't you?

1450
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:08,298
But l'm-- l like this place,
and, um, l love the people here.

1451
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:40,572
You know, if, if we were to,
uh, to put this apple down...

1452
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:45,569
and leave it, it would be spoiled
and gone within a few days.

1453
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:50,728
But if we were to take
a bite of it like this,

1454
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:53,579
it would become part of us,

1455
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:55,577
and we could take it with us forever.

1456
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:18,929
Al-- Everything...

1457
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:23,099
is on its way to somewhere.

1458
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,097
Everything.

1459
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:45,937
That's a good bite.

1460
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,292
Keep an eye out.

1461
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:21,458
Have you seen George Malley,
Miss Pennamin?

1462
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,093
What's the point?

1463
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,535
Look, it's not my call.

1464
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,860
l haven't seen him.

1465
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:53,414
- You mind if l get in your truck?
- Why?

1466
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:08,652
What's your first name?

1467
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:13,777
Jack.

1468
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:16,289
How would you want to die, Jack?

1469
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:29,659
Come on. Let's go.

1470
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:45,452
There you are.

1471
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,649
l knew l'd find you here.

1472
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:54,530
What are you working on?

1473
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:59,211
Doctor Ringold's coming tomorrow,
and l just wanted to finish this up.

1474
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:03,219
- Finish what?
- Ah, just some possibilities.

1475
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,092
Hey, come sit by me.

1476
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:09,575
Hmm?

1477
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,493
You scared?

1478
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:15,817
No.

1479
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:17,771
l wish l knew what you feel.

1480
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:22,690
Oh, you do.
You've always known it, Lace.

1481
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:27,098
l'll show you. When your children
were babies, how did you hold them?

1482
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:34,498
And if they had
a hard time sleeping,

1483
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:37,498
and you had to rock them to sleep,
well, how did you do it?

1484
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:00,652
See?

1485
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:07,092
Hey, look what l made back there.

1486
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:11,853
That looks like a bed.

1487
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:13,811
Are you expecting to get lucky?

1488
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:17,091
No, just hoping.

1489
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:29,294
When the road gets dark

1490
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:35,494
You can no longer see

1491
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:42,091
Just let my love
throw a spark, baby

1492
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:48,218
And have a little faith in me

1493
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:54,736
And when the tears you cry

1494
01:46:56,540 --> 01:47:00,613
Are all you can believe

1495
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:06,770
Just give these lovin' arms a try, baby

1496
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:12,658
And have a little faith in me

1497
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:18,093
Have a little faith in me

1498
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:23,697
Have a little faith in me

1499
