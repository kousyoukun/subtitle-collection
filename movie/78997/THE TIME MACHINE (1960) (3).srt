2
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,122
Excuse me, Mr. Filby.

3
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:46,168
I say, it's outright rude of the man!

4
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:48,864
He's merely been detained. That's all.

5
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:51,200
This is such a confounded waste of time!

6
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:54,937
If he's not coming, I've any number
of more important things to do.

7
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:01,942
Well, speak up. What is it, woman?

8
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:15,159
Well, are we or are we not invited
for dinner?

9
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,292
Apparently we are.

10
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:19,934
How long has he been gone?

11
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:23,033
I can't rightly say, sir. Several days.

12
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:25,434
I've hardly seen him for some time.

13
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:30,005
He never leaves the laboratory.
He only comes in and picks at his food.

14
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:33,108
But he did tell me about dinner tonight...

15
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:35,411
...and left those instructions.

16
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,779
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

17
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:43,557
What does it say, Filby? What's wrong?

18
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:44,889
Nothing really.

19
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:50,097
George merely says that if he's not here
by 8:00 then we're to begin without him.

20
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:53,903
Walter, what time is it?

21
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:59,769
Dinner is served, gentlemen.

22
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:03,377
First sensible thing I've heard all evening.

23
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,939
This is peculiar.

24
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:08,615
He's usually prompt, precise, and punctual.

25
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:11,745
He's making fools of us by inviting us
and then not showing up.

26
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:13,449
It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

27
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,388
To say nothing of the waste of time.

28
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,517
Yes. To say nothing of the waste of time.

29
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:21,894
There's one thing I like about old George,
he's got the best cellar in England.

30
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,296
And Mrs. Watchett...

31
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,197
...is the finest cook in the world.

32
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,899
Yes, I think I'll drink to that.

33
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:44,686
Good Lord! What's happened?

34
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:45,743
I'm all right.

35
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:49,784
Some food.

36
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:53,718
A drink.

37
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,167
I didn't recognize you.

38
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:08,910
Mrs. Watchett.

39
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,683
Can't you speak, man?
What happened to you?

40
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:20,722
- Leave him alone.
- No, it's all right.

41
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,382
I've got to tell it now
while I still remember it.

42
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,485
Relax. Try to relax.

43
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,964
You've all the time in the world.

44
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,165
You're right, David.

45
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,735
That's exactly what I have.

46
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,600
All the time in the world.

47
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,079
Ever since we were together
five days ago...

48
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,449
...the last day of 1899.

49
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:55,684
There in that box rests the result
of two years' labor.

50
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:02,559
I wanted to finish the job
before the new century began.

51
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,162
I barely made it.

52
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,262
Cheers, gentlemen.

53
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:09,862
Marvelous, old boy.

54
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,735
Yes, but what is it?

55
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:16,674
Well, it has to do with time.

56
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:20,883
I've always maintained
what this nation needs is...

57
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,846
...a reliable timepiece.

58
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,152
The Navy needs one.

59
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,122
The Army needs one
for the artillery, you know.

60
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,751
You couldn't do better, George.

61
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:32,759
So that's why you've been in hiding?

62
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,623
Very clever of you, indeed.

63
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:39,562
I don't think George is referring
to a new type of timepiece.

64
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:42,201
Not really.

65
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:47,475
When I speak of time, gentlemen,
I'm referring to the fourth dimension.

66
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,473
Go on, George.

67
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:58,149
The difficulty in explaining this dimension
is that it cannot be seen or felt.

68
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:00,179
If you don't mind, George...

69
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:04,449
...will you refresh me
on the first three dimensions?

70
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:05,651
Really, Filby.

71
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,425
Surely they taught you something
in school.

72
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:10,864
Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

73
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:13,065
Certainly.

74
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:21,100
For example, when I move in
a straight line, forward or backward...

75
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,102
...that's one dimension.

76
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,477
When I move to the left or the right...

77
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,640
...two dimensions.

78
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:28,817
When I move up or down...

79
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:31,015
...three dimensions.

80
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,957
For instance, that box.

81
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:40,394
That box has three dimensions:
Length, breadth, and height.

82
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:42,932
Yes, but what is the fourth dimension?

83
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,600
That's mere theory. No one knows
if the fourth dimension even exists.

84
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:50,171
On the contrary, Doctor.

85
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:54,373
The fourth dimension is as real and true
a dimension as any of the other three.

86
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,770
In fact, they couldn't exist without it.

87
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:58,973
What do you mean?

88
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:02,178
Let's take that box.

89
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:05,454
It has the first three dimensions,
as you said.

90
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,349
- All right. What's in that box?
- I'm coming to that.

91
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:10,222
Let's consider this first.

92
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:13,126
Why is it that we usually ignore
the fourth dimension?

93
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:15,561
Because we have no freedom
of movement within it.

94
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:17,463
We can move in the other three:

95
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:20,503
Up, down, forward, sideways, backward,
as the doctor said...

96
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,739
...but when it comes to time,
we are prisoners.

97
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:30,405
Do you follow me, Bridewell?

98
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,344
No!

99
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,979
You've given a most lucid explanation...

100
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:39,544
...but I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

101
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:43,424
There are many things in this world
you don't understand, aren't there?

102
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:44,983
Yes, quite. Quite a number.

103
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:47,996
You don't refuse to believe in them,
because of that, do you?

104
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:50,999
No, not if I can see the proof
with my own eyes.

105
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,398
Good, Walter.

106
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:55,627
Gentlemen, all I'm asking you to do now...

107
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:59,670
...is to witness the demonstration
of the possibility of movement...

108
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:02,108
...within the fourth dimension.

109
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:09,876
Doctor, can I have your help?

110
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,818
Certainly.

111
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,302
It's beautiful.

112
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,108
- Remarkable.
- Very nice, George.

113
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:42,744
Fascinating.

114
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:44,613
What is it?

115
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:47,319
This is only a small experimental model.

116
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,392
To carry a man, a larger edition is needed.

117
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:54,487
To carry a man? Where?

118
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:57,391
Into the past or into the future.

119
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:00,733
This is a time machine.

120
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:05,831
Now you've had your little joke.
Tell us what this contraption is really for.

121
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:07,843
I've already told you, Doctor.

122
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:11,974
The larger model can carry a passenger
on a journey through time.

123
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:14,676
Not through space, mind you,
but through time.

124
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:19,211
If you're going to float about in the future,
won't you mess things up for us?

125
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,688
The future's already there.
It's irrevocable and cannot be changed.

126
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,489
I wonder.

127
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:32,331
That's the most important question
to which I hope to find an answer.

128
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:35,329
Can man control his destiny?

129
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,866
Can he change the shape
of things to come?

130
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,934
Look, if you've gone out of your head,
I forgive you.

131
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:44,705
But if you've made us waste all this time...

132
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:47,272
No, Doctor! You're here as witnesses.

133
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,283
To see, not to listen.

134
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:50,785
To see? What?

135
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:53,785
The experiment I am about to perform.

136
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:56,749
Let me tell you how it works.

137
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,661
Here in this compartment is the saddle
where the time traveler sits.

138
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,527
In front of him are the controls.

139
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,925
Wait, let's do this properly.

140
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:07,367
You can spare a cigar, I trust, Doctor?

141
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,632
Let us imagine that this cigar...

142
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:16,439
...is the time traveler.

143
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,779
Now, in front of him is the lever
which controls movement.

144
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:24,687
Forward pressure sends the machine
into the future...

145
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,616
...backward pressure, into the past.

146
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:30,792
The harder the pressure,
the faster the machine travels.

147
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:35,494
Of course, our little experiment
can be performed only once.

148
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:39,130
If it succeeds, I lose my model forever.

149
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:41,801
That's why I need witnesses.

150
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,232
Go ahead, George.

151
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:47,766
Ready, gentlemen?

152
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:56,608
Lend me your hand, please.

153
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:48,099
I'll be damned.

154
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:49,632
It worked.

155
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,631
Where did it go?

156
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:54,298
Go?

157
00:13:54,444 --> 00:13:57,038
Nowhere, in the usual sense. It's still here.

158
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:00,683
But it's no longer in the present.

159
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:05,944
Do you realize it's traveling through time.
To the future, to be exact.

160
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:08,647
Do you really expect us
to believe such a story?

161
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,881
Certainly.

162
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,392
But you just said it hadn't really moved!

163
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:14,487
That's correct.

164
00:14:14,564 --> 00:14:16,589
Then why can't we see it?

165
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,132
Because we're in this room
on December 31, 1899...

166
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:23,900
...but the model we just saw
is perhaps 100 years away by now.

167
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,567
This room, even this whole house,
may not be here in 100 years.

168
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:31,079
But the time machine occupies
the same space that it did...

169
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:33,411
...a moment before it went up
on it's journey!

170
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:37,214
If it's occupying the same space,
why can't I feel it?

171
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:41,279
Remember that the space you're putting
your hand through is today's space.

172
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:44,554
You can't put your hand
into the space of tomorrow.

173
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,088
Space is space! It doesn't change!

174
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,857
The same space that's here now
should be here in 100 or even 1,000 years...

175
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,663
No, Philip, time changes space!

176
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,134
No.

177
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,473
This flat ground we're standing on...

178
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,033
...could have been at the bottom of the sea
a million years ago.

179
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:06,042
A million years from now,
it could be the interior of a huge mountain.

180
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,377
All right, suppose what you say is true.

181
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:11,977
What do you expect us to do
with such a contraption?

182
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:13,811
Contraption?

183
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:18,420
For my part, I intend taking a journey
into the future.

184
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:22,988
Or perhaps the doctor
would volunteer to go?

185
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,828
Well, look here, George...

186
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:29,463
...supposing you do go off and get lost
in the 50th century or something...

187
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:31,598
...how are you going to get back?

188
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:33,608
That's a risk I'm prepared to take.

189
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:36,811
Now, look here, George.

190
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,774
I don't know what you take us for,
but we're not fools!

191
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,841
We're practical men, businessmen.

192
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,547
Now, the question I want
to put to you is this:

193
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:50,024
Even if you had invented a time machine,
or whatever you call it, what of it?

194
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,287
What use would it be?
Who'd want to buy it?

195
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:54,192
How much would they pay for it?

196
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:57,426
Yes. Have you thought
of the commercial possibilities?

197
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:00,430
No, I really haven't.

198
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:05,035
There's a war on in South Africa.

199
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:07,672
The Boers are putting up
a pretty stiff fight.

200
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:10,272
The country needs inventors like you.

201
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:14,542
I can put you in touch
with the War Office if you wish.

202
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,283
What do you think, David?

203
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:26,058
Dr. Hillyer has a good point, George.

204
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:29,397
Now we're becoming more sensible.

205
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:31,797
I'll see to it the first thing in the new year.

206
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:34,166
Good Lord! It's time to go, gentlemen.

207
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:37,468
Yes, I'm sure we all have our plans
for tonight.

208
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:41,204
Are you all right, George?

209
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,576
Yes, I'm all right.

210
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:45,307
Coming, Bridewell?

211
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:53,015
Thank you for coming.

212
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:55,250
- Good night, George.
- Happy New Year.

213
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,216
Happy New Century, George.

214
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:58,885
Good night.

215
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:20,646
Happy New Year!

216
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:38,660
I thought I'd better stay.

217
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:52,031
You shouldn't have troubled yourself.
I'm all right.

218
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,905
No, you're not.

219
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:57,712
You've been behaving oddly
for over a month now.

220
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,908
I'm not leaving here until you tell me
what's on your mind.

221
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:05,681
I appreciate the gesture.
I just want to be left alone, that's all.

222
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:09,384
You've changed, George. Enormously.

223
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:12,922
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:18,425
Will you answer me one question,
honestly?

225
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:23,827
Yes, I'll try.

226
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:27,969
Why this preoccupation with time?

227
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:30,874
Why not?

228
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,608
Don't go simple on me, George.

229
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:40,922
If you want to know the truth, I don't
much care for the time I was born into.

230
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,115
It seems people aren't dying fast enough
these days.

231
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:48,188
They call upon science to invent new,
more efficient weapons...

232
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,298
...to depopulate the earth.

233
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,994
And I agree with you.

234
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:57,604
I agree, George, but here we are
and we have to make the best of it.

235
00:19:57,673 --> 00:19:59,698
You may have to. I don't.

236
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:03,505
All right. Take your journey
on your contraption.

237
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,204
What would you become?

238
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:07,539
A Greek? A Roman?

239
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:09,584
One of the Pharaohs?

240
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:10,846
I prefer the future.

241
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:15,421
You're not seriously saying you can do it?

242
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,627
You saw the experiment this afternoon,
didn't you?

243
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:22,693
I saw a toy machine vanish.

244
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,064
I'm sure there are a number of ways
of doing that trick.

245
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:31,365
Any magician at the hippodrome
could probably do it.

246
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,937
It wasn't a trick.

247
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:39,870
- Would you like to see the full-scale model?
- No, I would not.

248
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,018
I have no desire to tempt
the laws of Providence.

249
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:46,121
And I don't think you should.

250
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:49,514
It's not for man to trifle with.

251
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:52,060
You're carrying on like Hillyer and Kemp.

252
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:56,161
There is something to say about
their common-sense attitude to life.

253
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,394
George, I speak to you as a friend.

254
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:03,805
More. As a brother.

255
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:09,070
If that machine can do
what you say it can, destroy it.

256
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:12,908
Destroy it, George, before it destroys you!

257
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,714
You must have plans
for New Year's Eve, David.

258
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:18,378
Don't let me keep you.

259
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:23,248
Mary wasn't well.

260
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:26,092
We thought we'd stay home with the baby.

261
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:29,496
Why not come home with me?

262
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:33,094
You haven't seen Jaime for a long time.

263
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:39,641
I'm sorry, I can't.

264
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:41,903
What's stopping you?

265
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:48,840
I just want to see the old century out
by myself, that's all.

266
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:53,887
Have it your way, George.

267
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,761
Will you promise you'll not go out
of the house tonight?

268
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:12,206
I promise you, I won't walk out the door.

269
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:23,140
I'm sorry. Please don't think me unkind
or unfriendly.

270
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:26,052
- Just come over for dinner next Friday.
- Very well.

271
00:22:26,522 --> 00:22:28,615
Fine. Bring the others with you.

272
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:30,181
As you say, George.

273
00:22:31,794 --> 00:22:33,091
Happy New Year.

274
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:35,227
Happy New Year, David.

275
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:26,005
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.

276
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:29,450
Why don't you take the evening off
and celebrate?

277
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:34,387
Thank you, but if you're not needing me,
I'll turn in early and get some sleep if I can.

278
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:36,657
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

279
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,663
Mrs. Watchett, I've invited Mr. Filby
and the others for dinner next Friday night.

280
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:45,099
Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

281
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:15,474
<i>At first, I pushed the lever forward</i>
<i>ever so slightly...</i>

282
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:20,253
<i>... and the laboratory grew faint around rne.</i>

283
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:37,966
<i>I stopped.</i>

284
00:26:42,878 --> 00:26:44,072
<i>No change.</i>

285
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,475
<i>Everything exactly as it had been before.</i>

286
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,180
<i>But no. The clock said 6:31 when I started,</i>
<i>and now it was 8:09.</i>

287
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,450
<i>And the candle, shorter by inches.</i>

288
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:03,322
<i>Yet by rny watch,</i>
<i>which was in the rnachine with rne...</i>

289
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:05,332
<i>... only a few seconds had passed.</i>

290
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:28,189
<i>It was disconcerting to see the sun arc...</i>

291
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:30,052
<i>... in less than a rninute.</i>

292
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:33,818
<i>To see a snail race by.</i>

293
00:27:34,596 --> 00:27:38,032
<i>My flowers flinging wide their petals</i>
<i>to ernbrace the new day.</i>

294
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:41,993
<i>The hours speeding across the face</i>
<i>of rny sundial.</i>

295
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:45,807
<i>The flowers closing their eyes</i>
<i>for the night.</i>

296
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,633
<i>It was wonderful!</i>

297
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:50,839
<i>Changes that norrnally took hours,</i>
<i>occurring in seconds.</i>

298
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,681
<i>Dear Mrs. Watchett...</i>

299
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:00,682
<i>... always able to tell rne what tie to wear...</i>

300
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:03,623
<i>... but never able to decide</i>
<i>to wear anything rnore stylish...</i>

301
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:06,422
<i>... than the type of clothes</i>
<i>she's worn all these years.</i>

302
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:09,497
<i>And, as yet, I was traveling very slowly.</i>

303
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,031
<i>What if I went faster?</i>

304
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,389
<i>It becarne intoxicating.</i>

305
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:47,060
<i>So, I pushed the lever on</i>
<i>toward even greater speed.</i>

306
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,777
<i>As I went along, I gained experience</i>
<i>in handling the rnachine.</i>

307
00:28:59,648 --> 00:29:03,880
<i>I found that I could stop for a day,</i>
<i>an hour, or even for a second to observe.</i>

308
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:09,722
<i>Then, go ahead a year or two.</i>

309
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:14,720
<i>Thus, I was able to see the changing world</i>
<i>in a series of glirnpses.</i>

310
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,265
Good heavens! That's a dress?

311
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,732
<i>This was intriguing.</i>

312
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,869
<i>I wondered just how far</i>
<i>wornen would perrnit this to go.</i>

313
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:52,967
<i>I began to grow very fond</i>
<i>of that rnannequin.</i>

314
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:56,696
<i>Maybe because, like rne, she didn't age.</i>

315
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:12,109
<i>Thirteen years had passed.</i>

316
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:15,919
<i>Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...</i>

317
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:21,822
<i>Then, suddenly the light was gone.</i>
<i>What had happened?</i>

318
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:26,598
<i>In the year of 1917, I stopped.</i>

319
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:10,321
Filby!

320
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,364
What are you doing?
Going to a masquerade party?

321
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:21,008
You look rather silly
without your mustache, old man.

322
00:33:21,142 --> 00:33:22,905
We're you addressing me, sir?

323
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,445
Filby, it's George!

324
00:33:24,513 --> 00:33:27,107
I must say,
I expected a more enthusiastic greeting...

325
00:33:27,182 --> 00:33:29,548
I think you're confusing me with my father.

326
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:34,152
There was quite a resemblance.
I'm James Filby.

327
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:36,486
Was?

328
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,652
Were you a friend of Father's?

329
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:41,753
Yes.

330
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,694
Yes, I've been away.

331
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:46,199
He was killed in the war.

332
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:48,432
A year ago.

333
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:56,340
I'm so sorry.

334
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,642
What about the gentleman
across the street?

335
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:04,141
Oh, him? The inventor chap?

336
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:07,417
He disappeared around the turn
of the century.

337
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,153
If you're interested in that house,
I'm afraid you can't buy it.

338
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:14,620
You can't event get inside.

339
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:15,594
Why is that?

340
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:19,225
Well, my father was executor
of the inventor's estate...

341
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:21,667
...and father just refused to liquidate it.

342
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,600
I often chided him on that account...

343
00:34:24,673 --> 00:34:28,074
...but he felt positive
the owner would return some day.

344
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,904
People hereabouts think it's haunted, but...

345
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:35,147
Who are you?

346
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:40,146
Just a stranger who knew your father.

347
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:44,024
Have you been at the front?

348
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:47,859
Front? What front?

349
00:34:49,564 --> 00:34:51,088
The war, of course.

350
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:53,327
What war?

351
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:55,501
Good heavens!

352
00:34:56,438 --> 00:34:59,168
You don't know we've been at war
with Germany...

353
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,639
...since 1914?

354
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:03,943
I thought you'd just returned
from France, perhaps.

355
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:05,034
Or perhaps...

356
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:09,745
Perhaps a cup of tea
might make you feel better.

357
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:12,346
Won't you come in?

358
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:15,589
No. No, thank you.

359
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:20,352
Are you sure you're all right?

360
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:23,992
Yes, I'm quite all right.

361
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,325
Then, goodbye.

362
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,400
Goodbye, Jaime.

363
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:13,933
<i>Suddenly, in 1940, I began to be buffeted</i>
<i>frorn side to side.</i>

364
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,806
<i>I thought the rnachine had</i>
<i>a rnechanical defect or a worn-out part.</i>

365
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,524
<i>The last tirne I had stopped was in 1917,</i>
<i>23 years ago.</i>

366
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:43,197
<i>The war with Gerrnany was still waging...</i>

367
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:46,069
<i>... now in the air with flying rnachines.</i>

368
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:50,276
<i>Then I realized the truth of the rnatter.</i>

369
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:52,241
<i>This was a new war.</i>

370
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:56,916
<i>I decided to push on into tirne</i>
<i>and see the outcorne of this.</i>

371
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:02,820
<i>Then rny house was hit.</i>

372
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:06,349
<i>The flarnes shot up into the sky</i>
<i>and rny horne was gone in an instant.</i>

373
00:38:06,528 --> 00:38:08,223
<i>I found rnyself in the open air.</i>

374
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,072
<i>The years rolled by.</i>

375
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:21,272
<i>Everything unfarniliar.</i>

376
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:26,338
<i>Except the srnile of rny...</i>

377
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,838
<i>... never-aging friend.</i>

378
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:30,615
<i>But, what was this?</i>

379
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:33,279
<i>Weird sounds all around rne.</i>
<i>What could it be?</i>

380
00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:36,447
<i>My curiosity cornpelled rne to stop.</i>

381
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,037
<i>I thought rny rnachine</i>
<i>and I were the cause of the panic.</i>

382
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:03,376
<i>I was soon to find out they weren't.</i>

383
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:05,618
Keep it moving! Shove it on!

384
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,225
Come on, into the shelter.

385
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:13,111
Come on, young man. Come on.

386
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:15,250
Filby?

387
00:40:15,323 --> 00:40:16,790
The name is Mr. Filby.

388
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:18,758
Didn't you hear the air raid siren?

389
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:20,589
You mean the horrible screeching?

390
00:40:20,662 --> 00:40:23,597
It wasn't constructed
for its aesthetic value, young man...

391
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:26,828
...but to warn silly young fools like you
to get into the shelter.

392
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:28,095
Now, come along.

393
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:30,328
But I'm perfectly comfortable here.

394
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:33,267
I've got to talk to somebody.
This is fantastic!

395
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:35,032
Your store is magnificent!

396
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,777
The splendid achievements!

397
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:39,039
The gigantic strides mankind has taken!

398
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:41,274
Come along, young man. Come along!

399
00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:44,411
We'd better hurry
or the mushrooms will be sprouting!

400
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:45,679
Mushrooms?

401
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,620
You look familiar?

402
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:53,852
Haven't we met somewhere before?

403
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:56,787
Indeed we have, Mr. Filby. Right there.

404
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,721
Many years ago.

405
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,858
I'm sure of that.

406
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:03,465
But the exact time escapes me.

407
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,007
It was two wars ago.

408
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:09,402
1917.

409
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:14,046
Now, I recall. The chap who inquired
about my father...

410
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:18,042
...and the house that used to stand
across the way.

411
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:22,052
No.

412
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,521
That's impossible!

413
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,426
You haven't changed.

414
00:41:26,794 --> 00:41:28,193
You're not a day older.

415
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:30,590
And your clothes.

416
00:41:30,665 --> 00:41:34,601
Don't worry, Filby.
It'll take a little time to explain...

417
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,497
That's the last alert!

418
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,203
Hurry! Hurry!

419
00:41:39,507 --> 00:41:41,065
Listen, this is important.

420
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:42,140
Look.

421
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:47,779
An atomic satellite zeroing in.
That's important.

422
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:52,215
But I've got to talk to you!

423
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,518
Hurry!

424
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:58,716
Hide till the all clear!

425
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:01,561
But, Filby, I've got to talk to you!

426
00:42:35,163 --> 00:42:37,290
<i>The labor of centuries...</i>

427
00:42:37,832 --> 00:42:39,424
<i>... gone in an instant.</i>

428
00:42:50,678 --> 00:42:53,078
<i>Then rnother earth,</i>
<i>aroused by rnan's violence...</i>

429
00:42:53,147 --> 00:42:55,843
<i>... responded with volcanic violence</i>
<i>of her own.</i>

430
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:58,269
<i>Only rny speed through tirne saved rne</i>
<i>frorn being roasted alive...</i>

431
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,746
<i>... and encased in stone forever.</i>

432
00:44:02,283 --> 00:44:04,080
<i>The rnolten rock cooled.</i>

433
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,250
<i>I prayed...</i>

434
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:17,655
<i>... wondering how rnany centuries,</i>
<i>how rnany eons rnust pass...</i>

435
00:44:17,732 --> 00:44:21,896
<i>... before the wind and rain could</i>
<i>wear away the rnountain that enclosed rne.</i>

436
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:37,007
<i>Darkness.</i>

437
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:41,044
<i>Darkness for centuries.</i>

438
00:44:44,058 --> 00:44:48,051
<i>I wondered if there was still a war</i>
<i>being waged on the ground above rne...</i>

439
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:52,225
<i>... if rnan would still exist on earth,</i>
<i>when I saw the sun again.</i>

440
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:54,795
<i>The centuries rolled by.</i>

441
00:44:56,604 --> 00:44:58,731
<i>I put rny trust in tirne...</i>

442
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:01,639
<i>... and waited for the rock</i>
<i>to wear down around rne.</i>

443
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:06,805
<i>I was free again.</i>

444
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:17,621
<i>Thousands of centuries had passed...</i>

445
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:20,092
<i>... but the earth had stayed green.</i>

446
00:45:20,194 --> 00:45:22,424
<i>There was no winter, no wars.</i>

447
00:45:23,631 --> 00:45:27,897
<i>Had rnan finally learned to control</i>
<i>both the elernents and hirnself?</i>

448
00:45:28,736 --> 00:45:30,431
<i>I had to stop and find out.</i>

449
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,548
<i>But I'd stopped too fast.</i>

450
00:47:09,603 --> 00:47:10,934
<i>Magnificent!</i>

451
00:47:12,673 --> 00:47:15,039
<i>Flowers! Beautiful flowers everywhere!</i>

452
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:18,841
<i>Natural splendor beyond cornpare.</i>

453
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:27,246
<i>The whole landscape one vast garden</i>
<i>without any sign of weeds or briars.</i>

454
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:32,353
<i>Trees and vines, laden with fruit</i>
<i>of strange shapes and colors.</i>

455
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,228
<i>Nature tarned cornpletely...</i>

456
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,296
<i>... and rnore bountiful than ever before!</i>

457
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:40,867
<i>At last I'd found a paradise.</i>

458
00:47:44,038 --> 00:47:47,405
<i>But it would be no paradise</i>
<i>if it belonged to rne alone.</i>

459
00:48:09,463 --> 00:48:11,488
<i>Unrepaired for centuries.</i>

460
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:14,129
<i>Maybe unlived in for as long.</i>

461
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:31,806
Anybody here?

462
00:51:47,848 --> 00:51:50,840
<i>So this is rnan's future:</i>
<i>To bask in the sunlight...</i>

463
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:54,179
<i>... bathe in the clear strearns</i>
<i>and eat the fruits of the earth...</i>

464
00:51:54,254 --> 00:51:57,121
<i>... with all knowledge of work</i>
<i>and hardship forgotten.</i>

465
00:51:58,192 --> 00:51:59,853
Well, and why not?

466
00:52:27,755 --> 00:52:29,518
Don't just sit there! Help her!

467
00:53:22,242 --> 00:53:23,732
Are you all right?

468
00:54:22,434 --> 00:54:23,662
Thank you.

469
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:26,860
Why did you?

470
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,966
Why did I what?

471
00:54:30,008 --> 00:54:31,441
Come after me.

472
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,711
Sit down.

473
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:42,883
I did it to save your life.

474
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:46,883
That doesn't seem to mean much to you
or anybody else around here.

475
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:48,523
It doesn't.

476
00:54:50,295 --> 00:54:53,389
Do you realize there were 20
of your friends watching you drown?

477
00:54:53,465 --> 00:54:56,457
Not one of them lifted a finger to save you.

478
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:58,503
A very curious attitude.

479
00:55:01,373 --> 00:55:03,068
A very curious world.

480
00:55:06,612 --> 00:55:10,639
Aren't you the least bit interested
in who I am? Where I come from?

481
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:12,981
Should I be?

482
00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:19,522
You'd better take me
to somebody a little older.

483
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:21,183
Somebody I can talk to.

484
00:55:21,326 --> 00:55:22,850
There is no one older.

485
00:55:25,431 --> 00:55:27,695
Do you mean nobody ages
in this land of yours?

486
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:34,568
What's your name?

487
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,102
Weena.

488
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,641
How do you spell it?

489
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,906
Spell?

490
00:55:45,117 --> 00:55:47,210
Spell. Write. Can't you write?

491
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,021
Look.

492
00:55:57,996 --> 00:55:59,725
What are your people called?

493
00:55:59,798 --> 00:56:00,765
Eloi.

494
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:15,510
Come. We must go now.

495
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,947
- Why? What's wrong?
- It's getting dark.

496
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:48,669
I don't mind telling you, I'm quite hungry.

497
00:56:50,382 --> 00:56:52,145
I've come a long, long way.

498
00:56:56,722 --> 00:56:59,213
You know, in my time, a berry that size...

499
00:56:59,525 --> 00:57:02,551
...would've been big news
all over the civilized world.

500
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,089
Excuse me, sir.

501
00:57:11,503 --> 00:57:12,265
Sir?

502
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,943
Perhaps curiosity has died. Perhaps even...

503
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,442
...courtesy has died,
but I've come a long way...

504
00:57:21,513 --> 00:57:23,947
...and I would like to know a few things.

505
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:25,448
Why?

506
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:32,413
Because I shall return to my time...

507
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:36,558
...and my people will ask me questions,
such as:

508
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,398
What kind of government rules your world?

509
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,031
We have no government.

510
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:49,398
Well, you must have a body of men
who pass and enforce laws.

511
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:53,006
Laws? There are no laws.

512
00:57:57,282 --> 00:57:59,773
Where do you get your food and clothing?

513
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:02,850
Doesn't anybody work?

514
00:58:03,956 --> 00:58:04,650
No.

515
00:58:07,326 --> 00:58:09,191
Where does all that come from?

516
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:11,255
It grows. It always grows.

517
00:58:11,897 --> 00:58:13,524
Yes, I know, but it must be...

518
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,899
...cultivated and planted and nurtured...

519
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,029
Well, unless you...

520
00:58:22,174 --> 00:58:24,734
You mean, you have an economy
so well developed...

521
00:58:24,843 --> 00:58:26,868
...that you can spend all your time...

522
00:58:27,913 --> 00:58:29,505
...studying and experimenting?

523
00:58:29,581 --> 00:58:30,741
Is that right?

524
00:58:31,183 --> 00:58:32,548
You ask many questions.

525
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:41,017
That is the only way
that man has learned and developed.

526
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:42,921
I wish to learn.

527
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:47,159
I want to learn about you.

528
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,927
About your civilization.

529
00:58:57,976 --> 00:58:59,068
Do you have books?

530
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,140
Books?

531
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,475
Yes, we have books.

532
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:05,180
Wonderful!

533
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:09,744
I can learn all I want about you from books.
Books will tell me what I want to know.

534
00:59:12,124 --> 00:59:13,716
Could I see the books?

535
00:59:46,725 --> 00:59:49,285
Yes, they do tell me all about you.

536
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:05,509
What have you done?

537
01:00:06,178 --> 01:00:10,478
Thousands of years of building
and rebuilding, creating and recreating...

538
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:12,676
...so you can let it crumble to dust!

539
01:00:15,387 --> 01:00:19,016
A million years of sensitive men dying
for their dreams.

540
01:00:19,224 --> 01:00:20,486
For what?

541
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,917
So you can swim...

542
01:00:23,562 --> 01:00:25,029
...and dance and...

543
01:00:26,098 --> 01:00:27,258
...play!

544
01:00:37,576 --> 01:00:39,510
You! All of you!

545
01:00:40,445 --> 01:00:42,037
I'm going back to my own time!

546
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,714
I won't bother to tell
of the useless struggle...

547
01:00:44,783 --> 01:00:46,307
...the hopeless future.

548
01:00:46,418 --> 01:00:48,386
But at least I could die among men!

549
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:10,681
What are you doing?

550
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:12,814
I heard you pounding. I came to warn you.

551
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:14,256
How do you open that panel?

552
01:04:14,326 --> 01:04:16,556
No one opens it, only the Morlocks.

553
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,924
The Morlocks? Who are they?

554
01:04:23,868 --> 01:04:27,031
They give us the food we eat
and the clothes we wear.

555
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:28,572
We must obey their command.

556
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:30,297
Why have they taken my machine?

557
01:04:31,977 --> 01:04:33,842
You've got to tell me!

558
01:04:36,614 --> 01:04:38,809
It's night. We mustn't be out in the dark.

559
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:42,581
Only little children are frightened
by the dark.

560
01:04:43,822 --> 01:04:47,451
You are a little child, aren't you?
Don't be frightened. I'll light a fire.

561
01:04:47,525 --> 01:04:48,583
Please let us go.

562
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,891
I can't. My machine is inside.
I must find a way of getting it out.

563
01:04:53,031 --> 01:04:54,362
No, you mustn't.

564
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,229
Help me gather some wood.

565
01:05:11,549 --> 01:05:12,982
That's a girl.

566
01:05:22,027 --> 01:05:23,119
Where are you from?

567
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:28,599
As a matter of fact, I'm from right here.

568
01:05:31,436 --> 01:05:33,802
That's where my house used to be...

569
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:36,673
...many thousands of years ago.

570
01:05:38,943 --> 01:05:40,035
You see there?

571
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,043
From there up to those panels
was my laboratory.

572
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:49,120
Beyond the panels
was where my garden used to be.

573
01:05:51,856 --> 01:05:52,845
Right there.

574
01:05:54,025 --> 01:05:55,788
That was my library.

575
01:05:56,928 --> 01:06:00,955
Where I once sat talking with friends
about the time machine.

576
01:06:12,444 --> 01:06:13,877
You know, Weena...

577
01:06:15,447 --> 01:06:17,312
...I'd hoped to learn a great deal.

578
01:06:20,919 --> 01:06:24,980
I'd hoped to take back the knowledge
and the advancement mankind had made.

579
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:28,282
Instead, I find vegetables.

580
01:06:29,761 --> 01:06:32,559
The human race reduced
to living vegetables.

581
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,771
They're gone.

582
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:48,477
Are you all right?

583
01:06:52,617 --> 01:06:54,642
- That was a Morlock, was it?
- Yes.

584
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,711
Don't you worry.
The fire seems to keep them away.

585
01:07:12,704 --> 01:07:14,262
What are you doing?

586
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:16,430
Why did you put your hand in the fire?

587
01:07:16,508 --> 01:07:18,373
I never saw it before.

588
01:07:23,615 --> 01:07:25,139
No knowledge of fire.

589
01:07:27,152 --> 01:07:28,414
No books.

590
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,114
I'm terribly sorry.

591
01:07:35,894 --> 01:07:39,295
I'm sorry I was angry with your people.
I had no right to be.

592
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:45,664
No more than if I'd visited
the island of Bali in my own time.

593
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,367
But, you know, Weena...

594
01:07:53,311 --> 01:07:57,839
You were safe inside your great house,
yet came out into the night to warn me.

595
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:02,882
The characteristic which distinguished man
from the animal kingdom...

596
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:06,016
...was the spirit of self-sacrifice.

597
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:09,288
And you have that quality.

598
01:08:10,428 --> 01:08:14,660
I think all your people have it, really.
It just needs someone to reawaken it.

599
01:08:18,269 --> 01:08:19,793
I'd like to try if you'd let me.

600
01:08:20,738 --> 01:08:21,898
Will you?

601
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:24,541
I do not understand...

602
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:27,337
...but I believe you.

603
01:08:28,379 --> 01:08:30,472
That's as good a start as any.

604
01:08:33,451 --> 01:08:37,114
Try to tell me. The Morlocks.
Who or what are the Morlocks?

605
01:08:37,855 --> 01:08:39,652
Are they animals or people?

606
01:08:44,262 --> 01:08:45,456
What about yourself?

607
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,132
The past? Don't you people ever speak
of the past?

608
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,427
There is no past.

609
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,774
Do they ever wonder about the future?

610
01:08:59,811 --> 01:09:01,176
There is no future.

611
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:08,417
The past...

612
01:09:08,886 --> 01:09:10,285
...man's past...

613
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:15,749
...is mainly a grim struggle for survival.

614
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:20,890
But there have been moments
when a few voices have spoken up...

615
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,600
...and these rare moments have made
the history of man, man's past...

616
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:28,830
...a glorious thing.

617
01:09:31,276 --> 01:09:33,642
I refuse to believe it's dead and gone.

618
01:09:35,113 --> 01:09:38,810
We've had our dark ages before
and this is just another one of them.

619
01:09:40,351 --> 01:09:42,717
All it needs is someone
to show you the way out.

620
01:09:46,758 --> 01:09:48,692
I'm only a tinkering mechanic but...

621
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:52,420
...I'm sure there must be a hidden spark
in one of your people.

622
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:54,594
If only I can kindle that spark...

623
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,767
...my coming here will have some meaning.

624
01:10:06,444 --> 01:10:09,470
<i>My efforts the next rnorning</i>
<i>to open the panel were fruitless.</i>

625
01:10:09,547 --> 01:10:12,846
<i>I had to find another way</i>
<i>to retrieve rny rnachine.</i>

626
01:10:20,892 --> 01:10:21,688
Listen.

627
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:24,554
Do you hear that?

628
01:10:27,165 --> 01:10:28,097
Yes.

629
01:10:29,467 --> 01:10:30,627
Machines?

630
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:32,968
No, Morlocks.

631
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:36,437
You mean, those animals run machines?

632
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,435
They are Morlocks.

633
01:10:39,811 --> 01:10:41,711
But have you ever seen the machines?

634
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,713
No, only heard of them.

635
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:45,938
Who told you?

636
01:10:46,718 --> 01:10:47,582
The rings.

637
01:10:49,354 --> 01:10:50,343
What sort of rings?

638
01:10:50,988 --> 01:10:52,080
Rings that talk.

639
01:10:54,392 --> 01:10:56,690
Could you show me these talking rings?

640
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,628
Come, this way!

641
01:11:23,688 --> 01:11:25,815
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.

642
01:11:28,559 --> 01:11:29,526
They speak?

643
01:11:31,629 --> 01:11:32,755
Of what?

644
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:35,730
Things no one here understands.

645
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,491
Make it talk.

646
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,241
<i>The war between the East and West...</i>

647
01:11:45,309 --> 01:11:48,369
<i>... which is now in its 326th year...</i>

648
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,814
<i>... has at last corne to an end.</i>

649
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:55,080
<i>There is nothing left to fight with,</i>
<i>and few of us left to fight.</i>

650
01:11:55,553 --> 01:11:58,989
<i>The atrnosphere has becorne so polluted</i>
<i>with deadly gerrns...</i>

651
01:11:59,056 --> 01:12:01,581
<i>... that it can no longer be breathed.</i>

652
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,419
<i>There is no place on this planet</i>
<i>that is irnrnune.</i>

653
01:12:05,129 --> 01:12:08,496
<i>The last surviving factory</i>
<i>for the rnanufacture of oxygen...</i>

654
01:12:08,566 --> 01:12:09,931
<i>... has been destroyed.</i>

655
01:12:10,635 --> 01:12:13,331
<i>Stockpiles are rapidly dirninishing...</i>

656
01:12:13,604 --> 01:12:16,402
<i>... and when they are gone, we rnust die.</i>

657
01:12:28,519 --> 01:12:30,612
<i>My narne is of no consequence.</i>

658
01:12:32,023 --> 01:12:34,287
<i>The irnportant thing you should know is...</i>

659
01:12:34,358 --> 01:12:37,816
<i>... that I arn the last who rernernbers</i>
<i>how each of us...</i>

660
01:12:38,129 --> 01:12:39,562
<i>... rnan and wornan...</i>

661
01:12:39,997 --> 01:12:41,988
<i>... rnade his own decision.</i>

662
01:12:42,467 --> 01:12:46,233
<i>Sorne chose to take refuge</i>
<i>in the great caverns...</i>

663
01:12:46,304 --> 01:12:50,240
<i>... and find a new way of life</i>
<i>far below the earth's surface.</i>

664
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:55,569
<i>The rest of us decided</i>
<i>to take our chances in the sunlight...</i>

665
01:12:57,114 --> 01:13:00,015
<i>... srnall as those chances rnight be.</i>

666
01:13:01,452 --> 01:13:05,616
<i>Frorn the talking rings I learned</i>
<i>how the hurnan race divided itself...</i>

667
01:13:06,023 --> 01:13:09,550
<i>... and how the world of the Eloi</i>
<i>and the Morlocks began.</i>

668
01:13:11,028 --> 01:13:13,826
<i>By sorne awful quirk of fate...</i>

669
01:13:14,665 --> 01:13:19,068
<i>... the Morlocks had becorne the rnasters</i>
<i>and the Eloi their servants.</i>

670
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,967
<i>The Morlocks rnaintained thern</i>
<i>and bred thern like...</i>

671
01:13:23,574 --> 01:13:24,973
<i>... cattle.</i>

672
01:13:25,309 --> 01:13:28,574
<i>Only to take thern below</i>
<i>when they reached rnaturity.</i>

673
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,111
<i>Which explained why there were</i>
<i>no older people arnong thern.</i>

674
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,581
<i>I knew I rnust go below.</i>

675
01:13:33,651 --> 01:13:37,485
<i>It was the only rneans of finding a way</i>
<i>up into the sphinx to reach rny rnachine...</i>

676
01:13:37,588 --> 01:13:40,352
<i>... and discover what happened to thern</i>
<i>when they went below.</i>

677
01:13:40,892 --> 01:13:42,052
Don't go!

678
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:58,070
You won't come back!

679
01:13:58,409 --> 01:13:59,808
I'll be back.

680
01:14:15,393 --> 01:14:16,223
Weena!

681
01:14:58,936 --> 01:15:00,426
Answer me!

682
01:15:00,838 --> 01:15:02,100
Where are you?

683
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:31,533
What's happening?

684
01:15:33,037 --> 01:15:34,368
What's happening?

685
01:15:35,806 --> 01:15:37,797
What's the matter with you all?

686
01:15:55,893 --> 01:15:56,791
Weena, stop!

687
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:47,607
Stop!

688
01:16:49,947 --> 01:16:51,471
What happens to them?

689
01:16:55,553 --> 01:16:59,319
Don't stand there like fattened cattle!
Will you answer me?

690
01:17:01,692 --> 01:17:03,125
What is wrong?

691
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:06,227
There is nothing wrong. It is all clear.

692
01:17:09,366 --> 01:17:10,958
What do you mean, "All clear"?

693
01:17:11,268 --> 01:17:12,633
All clear.

694
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,406
In the middle of the 1900s,
the falling bombs, the people calling out:

695
01:17:18,476 --> 01:17:19,636
"All clear!"

696
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:21,233
No!

697
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:23,538
That's gone! That's passed!

698
01:17:23,614 --> 01:17:27,641
There's no more flying machines!
No more bombs! No more wars!

699
01:17:28,152 --> 01:17:30,677
The rings have told us that story.

700
01:17:31,322 --> 01:17:34,257
But you didn't listen!
You didn't learn anything!

701
01:17:34,825 --> 01:17:36,759
It was ages ago that men were taught...

702
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:39,489
...to hide below the ground
when the sirens blew...

703
01:17:39,563 --> 01:17:41,895
...to run from death, but it's over!

704
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,660
Those men are dead.

705
01:17:44,068 --> 01:17:46,036
The men who slaughtered them are dead!

706
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:50,635
But there is nothing to fear. It is all clear.

707
01:17:51,242 --> 01:17:53,073
What about the ones who went below?

708
01:17:53,144 --> 01:17:55,339
How do you think they're going
to come back?

709
01:17:57,114 --> 01:17:58,342
They never come back.

710
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:01,174
Nobody can bring them back.

711
01:18:01,752 --> 01:18:04,346
You can try. You can try!

712
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,455
Won't even one of you try?

713
01:18:12,096 --> 01:18:13,586
Well, I'll try!

714
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:34,131
<i>So, this was the destiny of the Eloi.</i>

715
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:39,102
<i>They were being bred by the Morlocks...</i>

716
01:20:39,743 --> 01:20:42,712
<i>... who had degenerated</i>
<i>into the lowest forrn of hurnan life:</i>

717
01:20:43,814 --> 01:20:44,940
<i>Cannibalisrn!</i>

718
01:22:31,855 --> 01:22:32,981
Weena, wake up!

719
01:22:33,057 --> 01:22:34,991
Come to your senses! All of you!

720
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,380
Burn.

721
01:24:08,185 --> 01:24:10,813
Give me something to burn.
It's my last match.

722
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,624
Get up the stairs!
That's the way out! Quickly!

723
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,032
The torch!

724
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,166
Get the torch!

725
01:26:31,528 --> 01:26:33,928
Get up the stairs! Hurry up!

726
01:28:17,567 --> 01:28:20,400
Get all the dead wood! Come on!
All the wood!

727
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:23,230
That's fine.

728
01:28:23,306 --> 01:28:24,933
Come on, throw it down!

729
01:28:26,777 --> 01:28:28,176
All the dead wood!

730
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,141
Throw it down!

731
01:28:33,216 --> 01:28:35,207
Do the same to the other wells!

732
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:37,550
All the wood down the well!

733
01:28:48,965 --> 01:28:51,957
All right, to the river! Come on!
Back to the river!

734
01:29:22,999 --> 01:29:24,489
All right, let's go!

735
01:29:31,641 --> 01:29:35,839
<i>Another night was corning,</i>
<i>but this night no Eloi needed to fear.</i>

736
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,980
<i>The underworld</i>
<i>of the Morlocks was gone...</i>

737
01:29:43,453 --> 01:29:46,217
<i>... and so was the life of leisure for the Eloi.</i>

738
01:29:49,659 --> 01:29:51,183
<i>But then what of rne?</i>

739
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:56,858
<i>I was irnprisoned in a world</i>
<i>in which I just did not belong.</i>

740
01:29:59,536 --> 01:30:00,525
Are you sorry?

741
01:30:03,006 --> 01:30:04,940
Sorry? Sorry for what?

742
01:30:05,475 --> 01:30:06,772
That you have to stay?

743
01:30:10,247 --> 01:30:11,236
Yes.

744
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:15,876
I'm sorry because I could tell so much
to the people of my time.

745
01:30:16,586 --> 01:30:17,985
I could let them know...

746
01:30:18,722 --> 01:30:22,658
...about the sorrow and the happiness
that the future has in store for them.

747
01:30:22,726 --> 01:30:24,717
Maybe they could learn from it.

748
01:30:26,263 --> 01:30:27,287
Or could they?

749
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,401
You don't want to stay, do you?

750
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:33,731
It isn't that.

751
01:30:35,071 --> 01:30:37,266
It's just that I don't really fit here...

752
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,604
...any more than you would in my time.

753
01:30:40,277 --> 01:30:42,575
I would love to see your time.

754
01:30:44,047 --> 01:30:45,810
You wouldn't be very happy there.

755
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:50,110
Do you have someone there?
Someone like me?

756
01:30:51,454 --> 01:30:52,944
No one like you.

757
01:30:56,393 --> 01:30:57,792
I have friends, of course.

758
01:30:57,928 --> 01:30:59,623
Friends who will miss me.

759
01:31:00,263 --> 01:31:02,424
As a matter of fact,
I'm probably late already.

760
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,264
Women?

761
01:31:06,436 --> 01:31:07,130
No.

762
01:31:10,974 --> 01:31:12,373
There is one woman.

763
01:31:14,411 --> 01:31:16,106
She looks after my house for me.

764
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:19,637
She's 62 years old, all wrinkled,
and nothing like you.

765
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,352
How do they wear their hair?

766
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:28,854
- Who?
- The women of your time.

767
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:32,889
Up.

768
01:31:33,563 --> 01:31:34,495
"Up"?

769
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,589
Up how?

770
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:43,032
I don't know. Kind of... up like that!

771
01:31:45,008 --> 01:31:46,134
Show me!

772
01:32:00,857 --> 01:32:02,518
Would I be pretty?

773
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,291
Yes, you would. Very pretty.

774
01:32:11,968 --> 01:32:14,129
I wish we could go back to my time.

775
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:18,404
Or even at a time before that,
when the world was young.

776
01:32:18,475 --> 01:32:20,170
We could be so very happy.

777
01:32:20,443 --> 01:32:21,410
Look!

778
01:32:41,865 --> 01:32:43,162
My machine!

779
01:32:45,235 --> 01:32:46,532
Come on, Weena!

780
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:07,582
<i>I was going the wrong way!</i>

781
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:10,141
<i>Back! Back! I had to go back!</i>

782
01:36:12,075 --> 01:36:14,566
It's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard.

783
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:16,305
Absolutely preposterous!

784
01:36:16,779 --> 01:36:20,613
There's one thing I'll say for old George,
you always could tell a good yarn.

785
01:36:20,683 --> 01:36:23,413
You're a truly great inventor, George.

786
01:36:24,587 --> 01:36:26,782
I think you ought to retire.

787
01:36:28,691 --> 01:36:30,625
Well, truthfully, George...

788
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,928
...where have you been the past week?

789
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:35,362
You shouldn't ask such questions, Walter.

790
01:36:35,431 --> 01:36:38,867
It is not hard for a man
to lose a little week, now and again.

791
01:36:41,804 --> 01:36:45,740
I can understand your doubt, my friends.
Take it as a lie if you wish.

792
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:49,774
I scarcely believe it myself,
now that I'm back.

793
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:59,244
David, there's the flower Weena gave me.

794
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:03,519
David, a present for you.

795
01:37:03,593 --> 01:37:08,326
You're interested in botany. Try to match
that with any species known today!

796
01:37:13,002 --> 01:37:14,196
I don't think I can.

797
01:37:18,841 --> 01:37:20,468
Time to go, Bridewell.

798
01:37:21,077 --> 01:37:22,806
Yes, it is getting late.

799
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:24,377
Good night, George.

800
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:25,914
Good night, George.

801
01:37:31,621 --> 01:37:35,148
You look exhausted, George.
You really should get some rest.

802
01:37:59,949 --> 01:38:02,281
Good night, George.
It's grand having you back.

803
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:04,443
Goodbye, David.

804
01:38:13,229 --> 01:38:15,629
Thanks for being such a good friend.

805
01:38:15,698 --> 01:38:16,756
Always.

806
01:38:32,348 --> 01:38:34,077
What do you think, Filby?

807
01:38:34,817 --> 01:38:36,409
One thing is certain.

808
01:38:36,486 --> 01:38:39,580
That flower couldn't possibly have bloomed
in the wintertime.

809
01:38:39,655 --> 01:38:42,522
You don't really believe
that story's true, do you?

810
01:38:43,826 --> 01:38:44,918
Good night.

811
01:38:47,063 --> 01:38:47,893
Go on.

812
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,142
He's gone!

813
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,843
Look!

814
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:55,188
I think I understand. You see the imprint?

815
01:39:56,432 --> 01:39:59,162
This is where the time machine
originally stood.

816
01:40:00,002 --> 01:40:01,594
The Morlocks moved it.

817
01:40:02,772 --> 01:40:04,967
They dragged it across the lawn...

818
01:40:05,608 --> 01:40:07,371
...right into the sphinx.

819
01:40:07,443 --> 01:40:08,569
Right there.

820
01:40:10,346 --> 01:40:13,076
Weena was standing here...

821
01:40:13,816 --> 01:40:15,443
...when he last saw her.

822
01:40:15,518 --> 01:40:16,644
Right here!

823
01:40:16,919 --> 01:40:19,717
The same space in a different time.

824
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:24,126
He dragged his heavy machine...

825
01:40:24,327 --> 01:40:25,726
...back in here...

826
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:28,124
...scratching the floor...

827
01:40:29,132 --> 01:40:31,930
...so he could appear
outside the sphinx again...

828
01:40:33,202 --> 01:40:35,568
...and help the Eloi build a new world.

829
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,835
Build a new world for himself.

830
01:40:41,978 --> 01:40:43,878
Right where he left her.

831
01:40:44,013 --> 01:40:44,945
Yes.

832
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:58,784
It's not like George
to return empty-handed.

833
01:40:59,729 --> 01:41:02,755
To try to rebuild a civilization
without a plan.

834
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,830
He must have taken something with him.

835
01:41:08,804 --> 01:41:10,237
Nothing.

836
01:41:17,346 --> 01:41:18,973
Except three books.

837
01:41:19,415 --> 01:41:21,076
Which three books?

838
01:41:21,884 --> 01:41:23,283
I don't know.

839
01:41:23,819 --> 01:41:25,184
Is it important?

840
01:41:26,923 --> 01:41:28,185
I suppose not.

841
01:41:30,092 --> 01:41:31,252
Only...

842
01:41:32,495 --> 01:41:34,963
...which three books
would you have taken?

843
01:41:41,771 --> 01:41:44,740
Mr. Filby, do you think he'll ever return?

844
01:41:45,408 --> 01:41:47,672
One cannot choose but wonder.

845
01:41:47,743 --> 01:41:48,869
You see...

846
01:41:48,945 --> 01:41:51,470
...he has all the time in the world.

847
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,076
