1
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,240
Excuse me, Mr. Filby.

2
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,200
I say, it's outright rude of the man!

3
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,760
He's merely been detained. That's all.

4
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
This is such a confounded waste of time!

5
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,600
If he's not coming, I've any number
of more important things to do.

6
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,320
Well, speak up. What is it, woman?

7
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, are we or are we not invited
for dinner?

8
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,040
Apparently we are.

9
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,560
How long has he been gone?

10
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,520
I can't rightly say, sir. Several days.

11
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,840
I've hardly seen him for some time.

12
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,240
He never leaves the laboratory.
He only comes in and picks at his food.

13
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,200
But he did tell me about dinner tonight...

14
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,400
...and left those instructions.

15
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,600
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

16
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,240
What does it say, Filby? What's wrong?

17
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,480
Nothing really.

18
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,480
George merely says that if he's not here
by 8:00 then we're to begin without him.

19
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,160
Walter, what time is it?

20
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,760
Dinner is served, gentlemen.

21
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,240
First sensible thing I've heard all evening.

22
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,680
This is peculiar.

23
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,240
He's usually prompt, precise, and punctual.

24
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,240
He's making fools of us by inviting us
and then not showing up.

25
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,880
It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

26
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,760
To say nothing of the waste of time.

27
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Yes. To say nothing of the waste of time.

28
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,000
There's one thing I like about old George,
he's got the best cellar in England.

29
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,320
And Mrs. Watchett...

30
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
...is the finest cook in the world.

31
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,760
Yes, I think I'll drink to that.

32
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,840
Good Lord! What's happened?

33
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
I'm all right.

34
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,720
Some food.

35
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,520
A drink.

36
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,400
I didn't recognize you.

37
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
Mrs. Watchett.

38
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,440
Can't you speak, man?
What happened to you?

39
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,400
- Leave him alone.
- No, it's all right.

40
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,960
I've got to tell it now
while I still remember it.

41
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,960
Relax. Try to relax.

42
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,360
You've all the time in the world.

43
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
You're right, David.

44
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,760
That's exactly what I have.

45
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
All the time in the world.

46
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,760
Ever since we were together
five days ago...

47
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,040
...the last day of 1899.

48
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,920
There in that box rests the result
of two years' labor.

49
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,520
I wanted to finish the job
before the new century began.

50
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
I barely made it.

51
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,000
Cheers, gentlemen.

52
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,520
Marvelous, old boy.

53
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,320
Yes, but what is it?

54
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,080
Well, it has to do with time.

55
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,120
I've always maintained
what this nation needs is...

56
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,000
...a reliable timepiece.

57
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,200
The Navy needs one.

58
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,040
The Army needs one
for the artillery, you know.

59
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
You couldn't do better, George.

60
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,480
So that's why you've been in hiding?

61
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,240
Very clever of you, indeed.

62
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't think George is referring
to a new type of timepiece.

63
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,560
Not really.

64
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,600
When I speak of time, gentlemen,
I'm referring to the fourth dimension.

65
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,400
Go on, George.

66
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,840
The difficulty in explaining this dimension
is that it cannot be seen or felt.

67
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
If you don't mind, George...

68
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,880
...will you refresh me
on the first three dimensions?

69
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Really, Filby.

70
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Surely they taught you something
in school.

71
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,040
Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

72
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,160
Certainly.

73
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,840
For example, when I move in
a straight line, forward or backward...

74
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,760
...that's one dimension.

75
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,040
When I move to the left or the right...

76
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
...two dimensions.

77
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
When I move up or down...

78
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,360
...three dimensions.

79
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,160
For instance, that box.

80
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,360
That box has three dimensions:
Length, breadth, and height.

81
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,800
Yes, but what is the fourth dimension?

82
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,240
That's mere theory. No one knows
if the fourth dimension even exists.

83
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,720
On the contrary, Doctor.

84
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,760
The fourth dimension is as real and true
a dimension as any of the other three.

85
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,040
In fact, they couldn't exist without it.

86
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,160
What do you mean?

87
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,240
Let's take that box.

88
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,400
It has the first three dimensions,
as you said.

89
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,160
- All right. What's in that box?
- I'm coming to that.

90
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,960
Let's consider this first.

91
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,760
Why is it that we usually ignore
the fourth dimension?

92
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,080
Because we have no freedom
of movement within it.

93
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,920
We can move in the other three:

94
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,840
Up, down, forward, sideways, backward,
as the doctor said...

95
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,920
...but when it comes to time,
we are prisoners.

96
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,320
Do you follow me, Bridewell?

97
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,200
No!

98
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,640
You've given a most lucid explanation...

99
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
...but I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

100
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,800
There are many things in this world
you don't understand, aren't there?

101
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,320
Yes, quite. Quite a number.

102
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,200
You don't refuse to believe in them,
because of that, do you?

103
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,080
No, not if I can see the proof
with my own eyes.

104
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,400
Good, Walter.

105
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,520
Gentlemen, all I'm asking you to do now...

106
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,400
...is to witness the demonstration
of the possibility of movement...

107
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,720
...within the fourth dimension.

108
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,160
Doctor, can I have your help?

109
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,040
Certainly.

110
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,480
It's beautiful.

111
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,160
- Remarkable.
- Very nice, George.

112
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,680
Fascinating.

113
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
What is it?

114
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,080
This is only a small experimental model.

115
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,960
To carry a man, a larger edition is needed.

116
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,960
To carry a man? Where?

117
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,760
Into the past or into the future.

118
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,960
This is a time machine.

119
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,840
Now you've had your little joke.
Tell us what this contraption is really for.

120
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,760
I've already told you, Doctor.

121
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
The larger model can carry a passenger
on a journey through time.

122
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,320
Not through space, mind you,
but through time.

123
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,680
If you're going to float about in the future,
won't you mess things up for us?

124
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,000
The future's already there.
It's irrevocable and cannot be changed.

125
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,640
I wonder.

126
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,240
That's the most important question
to which I hope to find an answer.

127
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Can man control his destiny?

128
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,520
Can he change the shape
of things to come?

129
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,480
Look, if you've gone out of your head,
I forgive you.

130
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,120
But if you've made us waste all this time...

131
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,560
No, Doctor! You're here as witnesses.

132
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,520
To see, not to listen.

133
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,960
To see? What?

134
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,840
The experiment I am about to perform.

135
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
Let me tell you how it works.

136
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,440
Here in this compartment is the saddle
where the time traveler sits.

137
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,200
In front of him are the controls.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,520
Wait, let's do this properly.

139
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,840
You can spare a cigar, I trust, Doctor?

140
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,880
Let us imagine that this cigar...

141
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,560
...is the time traveler.

142
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,720
Now, in front of him is the lever
which controls movement.

143
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
Forward pressure sends the machine
into the future...

144
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,280
...backward pressure, into the past.

145
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,320
The harder the pressure,
the faster the machine travels.

146
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,840
Of course, our little experiment
can be performed only once.

147
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,320
If it succeeds, I lose my model forever.

148
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,880
That's why I need witnesses.

149
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,160
Go ahead, George.

150
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,600
Ready, gentlemen?

151
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,080
Lend me your hand, please.

152
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll be damned.

153
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,920
It worked.

154
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,800
Where did it go?

155
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,400
Go?

156
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
Nowhere, in the usual sense. It's still here.

157
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,520
But it's no longer in the present.

158
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,560
Do you realize it's traveling through time.
To the future, to be exact.

159
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,160
Do you really expect us
to believe such a story?

160
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,320
Certainly.

161
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
But you just said it hadn't really moved!

162
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,760
That's correct.

163
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,800
Then why can't we see it?

164
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,160
Because we're in this room
on December 31, 1899...

165
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,800
...but the model we just saw
is perhaps 100 years away by now.

166
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,320
This room, even this whole house,
may not be here in 100 years.

167
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,680
But the time machine occupies
the same space that it did...

168
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
...a moment before it went up
on it's journey!

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,560
If it's occupying the same space,
why can't I feel it?

170
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,480
Remember that the space you're putting
your hand through is today's space.

171
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,600
You can't put your hand
into the space of tomorrow.

172
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,040
Space is space! It doesn't change!

173
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,640
The same space that's here now
should be here in 100 or even 1,000 years...

174
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,320
No, Philip, time changes space!

175
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,760
No.

176
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,960
This flat ground we're standing on...

177
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360
...could have been at the bottom of the sea
a million years ago.

178
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,200
A million years from now,
it could be the interior of a huge mountain.

179
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,400
All right, suppose what you say is true.

180
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,920
What do you expect us to do
with such a contraption?

181
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,640
Contraption?

182
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,080
For my part, I intend taking a journey
into the future.

183
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,440
Or perhaps the doctor
would volunteer to go?

184
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,200
Well, look here, George...

185
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
...supposing you do go off and get lost
in the 50th century or something...

186
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,720
...how are you going to get back?

187
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,640
That's a risk I'm prepared to take.

188
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
Now, look here, George.

189
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,520
I don't know what you take us for,
but we're not fools!

190
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,520
We're practical men, businessmen.

191
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,080
Now, the question I want
to put to you is this:

192
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,400
Even if you had invented a time machine,
or whatever you call it, what of it?

193
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,560
What use would it be?
Who'd want to buy it?

194
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,400
How much would they pay for it?

195
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,480
Yes. Have you thought
of the commercial possibilities?

196
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,360
No, I really haven't.

197
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,800
There's a war on in South Africa.

198
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,320
The Boers are putting up
a pretty stiff fight.

199
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
The country needs inventors like you.

200
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
I can put you in touch
with the War Office if you wish.

201
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,400
What do you think, David?

202
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,960
Dr. Hillyer has a good point, George.

203
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,160
Now we're becoming more sensible.

204
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,440
I'll see to it the first thing in the new year.

205
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,720
Good Lord! It's time to go, gentlemen.

206
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,880
Yes, I'm sure we all have our plans
for tonight.

207
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
Are you all right, George?

208
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,760
Yes, I'm all right.

209
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,400
Coming, Bridewell?

210
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,800
Thank you for coming.

211
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,960
- Good night, George.
- Happy New Year.

212
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
Happy New Century, George.

213
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
Good night.

214
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,280
Happy New Year!

215
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,120
I thought I'd better stay.

216
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,960
You shouldn't have troubled yourself.
I'm all right.

217
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,720
No, you're not.

218
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,400
You've been behaving oddly
for over a month now.

219
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm not leaving here until you tell me
what's on your mind.

220
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,040
I appreciate the gesture.
I just want to be left alone, that's all.

221
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,600
You've changed, George. Enormously.

222
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,240
Will you answer me one question,
honestly?

224
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,440
Yes, I'll try.

225
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,400
Why this preoccupation with time?

226
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,200
Why not?

227
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,800
Don't go simple on me, George.

228
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,840
If you want to know the truth, I don't
much care for the time I was born into.

229
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,880
It seems people aren't dying fast enough
these days.

230
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,800
They call upon science to invent new,
more efficient weapons...

231
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,840
...to depopulate the earth.

232
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,400
And I agree with you.

233
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,840
I agree, George, but here we are
and we have to make the best of it.

234
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,840
You may have to. I don't.

235
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,480
All right. Take your journey
on your contraption.

236
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,120
What would you become?

237
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,360
A Greek? A Roman?

238
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,320
One of the Pharaohs?

239
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,520
I prefer the future.

240
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,920
You're not seriously saying you can do it?

241
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,960
You saw the experiment this afternoon,
didn't you?

242
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,880
I saw a toy machine vanish.

243
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,080
I'm sure there are a number of ways
of doing that trick.

244
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Any magician at the hippodrome
could probably do it.

245
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,680
It wasn't a trick.

246
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,360
- Would you like to see the full-scale model?
- No, I would not.

247
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,400
I have no desire to tempt
the laws of Providence.

248
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,360
And I don't think you should.

249
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,600
It's not for man to trifle with.

250
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,040
You're carrying on like Hillyer and Kemp.

251
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,000
There is something to say about
their common-sense attitude to life.

252
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,080
George, I speak to you as a friend.

253
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,320
More. As a brother.

254
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,360
If that machine can do
what you say it can, destroy it.

255
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,040
Destroy it, George, before it destroys you!

256
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,680
You must have plans
for New Year's Eve, David.

257
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,280
Don't let me keep you.

258
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
Mary wasn't well.

259
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,680
We thought we'd stay home with the baby.

260
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,960
Why not come home with me?

261
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,400
You haven't seen Jaime for a long time.

262
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm sorry, I can't.

263
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,840
What's stopping you?

264
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,520
I just want to see the old century out
by myself, that's all.

265
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,360
Have it your way, George.

266
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,760
Will you promise you'll not go out
of the house tonight?

267
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,920
I promise you, I won't walk out the door.

268
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm sorry. Please don't think me unkind
or unfriendly.

269
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,200
- Just come over for dinner next Friday.
- Very well.

270
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,640
Fine. Bring the others with you.

271
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,160
As you say, George.

272
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,960
Happy New Year.

273
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Happy New Year, David.

274
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,680
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.

275
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,000
Why don't you take the evening off
and celebrate?

276
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,720
Thank you, but if you're not needing me,
I'll turn in early and get some sleep if I can.

277
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,920
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

278
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,680
Mrs. Watchett, I've invited Mr. Filby
and the others for dinner next Friday night.

279
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,000
Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

280
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,240
At first, I pushed the lever forward
ever so slightly...

281
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,800
...and the laboratory grew faint around me.

282
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,800
I stopped.

283
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
No change.

284
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,920
Everything exactly as it had been before.

285
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,400
But no. The clock said 6:31 when I started,
and now it was 8:09.

286
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,480
And the candle, shorter by inches.

287
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,120
Yet by my watch,
which was in the machine with me...

288
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,040
...only a few seconds had passed.

289
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,960
It was disconcerting to see the sun arc...

290
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,760
...in less than a minute.

291
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,360
To see a snail race by.

292
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,400
My flowers flinging wide their petals
to embrace the new day.

293
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,200
The hours speeding across the face
of my sundial.

294
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,840
The flowers closing their eyes
for the night.

295
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,600
It was wonderful!

296
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,680
Changes that normally took hours,
occurring in seconds.

297
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,280
Dear Mrs. Watchett...

298
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,120
...always able to tell me what tie to wear...

299
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,920
...but never able to decide
to wear anything more stylish...

300
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,640
...than the type of clothes
she's worn all these years.

301
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,560
And, as yet, I was traveling very slowly.

302
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,960
What if I went faster?

303
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,120
It became intoxicating.

304
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,600
So, I pushed the lever on
toward even greater speed.

305
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,840
As I went along, I gained experience
in handling the machine.

306
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,720
I found that I could stop for a day,
an hour, or even for a second to observe.

307
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
Then, go ahead a year or two.

308
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,120
Thus, I was able to see the changing world
in a series of glimpses.

309
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,400
Good heavens! That's a dress?

310
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,640
This was intriguing.

311
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,600
I wondered just how far
women would permit this to go.

312
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,800
I began to grow very fond
of that mannequin.

313
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Maybe because, like me, she didn't age.

314
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,160
Thirteen years had passed.

315
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,800
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

316
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Then, suddenly the light was gone.
What had happened?

317
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,040
In the year of 1917, I stopped.

318
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
Filby!

319
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,960
What are you doing?
Going to a masquerade party?

320
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,320
You look rather silly
without your mustache, old man.

321
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,160
We're you addressing me, sir?

322
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,640
Filby, it's George!

323
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,160
I must say,
I expected a more enthusiastic greeting...

324
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,520
I think you're confusing me with my father.

325
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,920
There was quite a resemblance.
I'm James Filby.

326
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,160
Was?

327
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,160
Were you a friend of Father's?

328
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,200
Yes.

329
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,080
Yes, I've been away.

330
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,480
He was killed in the war.

331
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,640
A year ago.

332
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,200
I'm so sorry.

333
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,280
What about the gentleman
across the street?

334
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,680
Oh, him? The inventor chap?

335
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,840
He disappeared around the turn
of the century.

336
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,360
If you're interested in that house,
I'm afraid you can't buy it.

337
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,720
You can't event get inside.

338
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,680
Why is that?

339
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,160
Well, my father was executor
of the inventor's estate...

340
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,480
...and father just refused to liquidate it.

341
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,320
I often chided him on that account...

342
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,640
...but he felt positive
the owner would return some day.

343
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,360
People hereabouts think it's haunted, but...

344
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,440
Who are you?

345
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,240
Just a stranger who knew your father.

346
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,960
Have you been at the front?

347
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,600
Front? What front?

348
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,720
The war, of course.

349
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,880
What war?

350
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,960
Good heavens!

351
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,480
You don't know we've been at war
with Germany...

352
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,880
...since 1914?

353
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,040
I thought you'd just returned
from France, perhaps.

354
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,080
Or perhaps...

355
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,600
Perhaps a cup of tea
might make you feel better.

356
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,120
Won't you come in?

357
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
No. No, thank you.

358
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,800
Are you sure you're all right?

359
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,280
Yes, I'm quite all right.

360
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,480
Then, goodbye.

361
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,280
Goodbye, Jaime.

362
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Suddenly, in 1940, I began to be buffeted
from side to side.

363
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,440
I thought the machine had
a mechanical defect or a worn-out part.

364
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,200
The last time I had stopped was in 1917,
23 years ago.

365
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,760
The war with Germany was still waging...

366
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,520
...now in the air with flying machines.

367
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,560
Then I realized the truth of the matter.

368
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,440
This was a new war.

369
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,920
I decided to push on into time
and see the outcome of this.

370
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,600
Then my house was hit.

371
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,960
The flames shot up into the sky
and my home was gone in an instant.

372
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,760
I found myself in the open air.

373
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,160
The years rolled by.

374
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
Everything unfamiliar.

375
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,160
Except the smile of my...

376
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,560
...never-aging friend.

377
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,240
But, what was this?

378
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,800
Weird sounds all around me.
What could it be?

379
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,840
My curiosity compelled me to stop.

380
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,600
I thought my machine
and I were the cause of the panic.

381
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,680
I was soon to find out they weren't.

382
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Keep it moving! Shove it on!

383
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
Come on, into the shelter.

384
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Come on, young man. Come on.

385
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,600
Filby?

386
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,080
The name is Mr. Filby.

387
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,960
Didn't you hear the air raid siren?

388
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,720
You mean the horrible screeching?

389
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,600
It wasn't constructed
for its aesthetic value, young man...

390
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,720
...but to warn silly young fools like you
to get into the shelter.

391
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,920
Now, come along.

392
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,040
But I'm perfectly comfortable here.

393
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,880
I've got to talk to somebody.
This is fantastic!

394
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,560
Your store is magnificent!

395
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,240
The splendid achievements!

396
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,400
The gigantic strides mankind has taken!

397
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,560
Come along, young man. Come along!

398
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,560
We'd better hurry
or the mushrooms will be sprouting!

399
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,800
Mushrooms?

400
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,480
You look familiar?

401
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,640
Haven't we met somewhere before?

402
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,440
Indeed we have, Mr. Filby. Right there.

403
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,280
Many years ago.

404
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,320
I'm sure of that.

405
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,840
But the exact time escapes me.

406
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,240
It was two wars ago.

407
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,520
1917.

408
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,000
Now, I recall. The chap who inquired
about my father...

409
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,800
...and the house that used to stand
across the way.

410
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,680
No.

411
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,040
That's impossible!

412
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,880
You haven't changed.

413
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,560
You're not a day older.

414
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,840
And your clothes.

415
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,720
Don't worry, Filby.
It'll take a little time to explain...

416
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,480
That's the last alert!

417
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,120
Hurry! Hurry!

418
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,880
Listen, this is important.

419
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,920
Look.

420
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,320
An atomic satellite zeroing in.
That's important.

421
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,600
But I've got to talk to you!

422
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,720
Hurry!

423
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,840
Hide till the all clear!

424
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,560
But, Filby, I've got to talk to you!

425
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,840
The labor of centuries...

426
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,880
...gone in an instant.

427
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,960
Then mother earth,
aroused by man's violence...

428
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,600
...responded with volcanic violence
of her own.

429
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,480
Only my speed through time saved me
from being roasted alive...

430
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,840
...and encased in stone forever.

431
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,040
The molten rock cooled.

432
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,800
I prayed...

433
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,080
...wondering how many centuries,
how many eons must pass...

434
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,160
...before the wind and rain could
wear away the mountain that enclosed me.

435
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,640
Darkness.

436
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,520
Darkness for centuries.

437
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,240
I wondered if there was still a war
being waged on the ground above me...

438
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,240
...if man would still exist on earth,
when I saw the sun again.

439
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,680
The centuries rolled by.

440
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,480
I put my trust in time...

441
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,240
...and waited for the rock
to wear down around me.

442
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,200
I was free again.

443
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,600
Thousands of centuries had passed...

444
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,960
...but the earth had stayed green.

445
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,200
There was no winter, no wars.

446
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,440
Had man finally learned to control
both the elements and himself?

447
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,880
I had to stop and find out.

448
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,120
But I'd stopped too fast.

449
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,240
Magnificent!

450
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,200
Flowers! Beautiful flowers everywhere!

451
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,840
Natural splendor beyond compare.

452
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,920
The whole landscape one vast garden
without any sign of weeds or briars.

453
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Trees and vines, laden with fruit
of strange shapes and colors.

454
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,560
Nature tamed completely...

455
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,480
...and more bountiful than ever before!

456
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,960
At last I'd found a paradise.

457
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,240
But it would be no paradise
if it belonged to me alone.

458
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,320
Unrepaired for centuries.

459
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,880
Maybe unlived in for as long.

460
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,360
Anybody here?

461
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,680
So this is man's future:
To bask in the sunlight...

462
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,920
...bathe in the clear streams
and eat the fruits of the earth...

463
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,720
...with all knowledge of work
and hardship forgotten.

464
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,360
Well, and why not?

465
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,800
Don't just sit there! Help her!

466
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,800
Are you all right?

467
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,200
Thank you.

468
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,280
Why did you?

469
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,280
Why did I what?

470
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,640
Come after me.

471
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,760
Sit down.

472
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,640
I did it to save your life.

473
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,480
That doesn't seem to mean much to you
or anybody else around here.

474
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,040
It doesn't.

475
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,720
Do you realize there were 20
of your friends watching you drown?

476
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,640
Not one of them lifted a finger to save you.

477
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,600
A very curious attitude.

478
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,000
A very curious world.

479
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,240
Aren't you the least bit interested
in who I am? Where I come from?

480
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,480
Should I be?

481
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,760
You'd better take me
to somebody a little older.

482
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,360
Somebody I can talk to.

483
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,960
There is no one older.

484
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,600
Do you mean nobody ages
in this land of yours?

485
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,200
What's your name?

486
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,680
Weena.

487
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,960
How do you spell it?

488
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
Spell?

489
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
Spell. Write. Can't you write?

490
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,000
Look.

491
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,320
What are your people called?

492
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,320
Eloi.

493
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,480
Come. We must go now.

494
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,800
- Why? What's wrong?
- It's getting dark.

495
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,280
I don't mind telling you, I'm quite hungry.

496
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,600
I've come a long, long way.

497
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,360
You know, in my time, a berry that size...

498
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,560
...would've been big news
all over the civilized world.

499
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,840
Excuse me, sir.

500
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:51,880
Sir?

501
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,280
Perhaps curiosity has died. Perhaps even...

502
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,680
...courtesy has died,
but I've come a long way...

503
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,080
...and I would like to know a few things.

504
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,520
Why?

505
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,200
Because I shall return to my time...

506
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,200
...and my people will ask me questions,
such as:

507
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,880
What kind of government rules your world?

508
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,400
We have no government.

509
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,520
Well, you must have a body of men
who pass and enforce laws.

510
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,960
Laws? There are no laws.

511
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,440
Where do you get your food and clothing?

512
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,400
Doesn't anybody work?

513
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,120
No.

514
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,480
Where does all that come from?

515
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,480
It grows. It always grows.

516
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,640
Yes, I know, but it must be...

517
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,880
...cultivated and planted and nurtured...

518
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,800
Well, unless you...

519
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,400
You mean, you have an economy
so well developed...

520
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,440
...that you can spend all your time...

521
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,960
...studying and experimenting?

522
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,160
Is that right?

523
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,880
You ask many questions.

524
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
That is the only way
that man has learned and developed.

525
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,840
I wish to learn.

526
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,880
I want to learn about you.

527
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,600
About your civilization.

528
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,320
Do you have books?

529
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,320
Books?

530
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,560
Yes, we have books.

531
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,200
Wonderful!

532
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,560
I can learn all I want about you from books.
Books will tell me what I want to know.

533
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,360
Could I see the books?

534
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,480
Yes, they do tell me all about you.

535
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,040
What have you done?

536
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,800
Thousands of years of building
and rebuilding, creating and recreating...

537
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,920
...so you can let it crumble to dust!

538
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,000
A million years of sensitive men dying
for their dreams.

539
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,400
For what?

540
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,720
So you can swim...

541
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,760
...and dance and...

542
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,880
...play!

543
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,640
You! All of you!

544
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,080
I'm going back to my own time!

545
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,640
I won't bother to tell
of the useless struggle...

546
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,160
...the hopeless future.

547
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,160
But at least I could die among men!

548
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,160
What are you doing?

549
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,200
I heard you pounding. I came to warn you.

550
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,600
How do you open that panel?

551
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,800
No one opens it, only the Morlocks.

552
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,040
The Morlocks? Who are they?

553
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,840
They give us the food we eat
and the clothes we wear.

554
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,320
We must obey their command.

555
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,000
Why have they taken my machine?

556
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,400
You've got to tell me!

557
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,160
It's night. We mustn't be out in the dark.

558
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,760
Only little children are frightened
by the dark.

559
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,440
You are a little child, aren't you?
Don't be frightened. I'll light a fire.

560
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,520
Please let us go.

561
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,680
I can't. My machine is inside.
I must find a way of getting it out.

562
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,080
No, you mustn't.

563
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,840
Help me gather some wood.

564
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,920
That's a girl.

565
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,640
Where are you from?

566
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,880
As a matter of fact, I'm from right here.

567
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,880
That's where my house used to be...

568
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,640
...many thousands of years ago.

569
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,880
You see there?

570
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,680
From there up to those panels
was my laboratory.

571
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,560
Beyond the panels
was where my garden used to be.

572
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,160
Right there.

573
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,960
That was my library.

574
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,920
Where I once sat talking with friends
about the time machine.

575
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,320
You know, Weena...

576
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,600
...I’d hoped to learn a great deal.

577
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,960
I'd hoped to take back the knowledge
and the advancement mankind had made.

578
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,120
Instead, I find vegetables.

579
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,240
The human race reduced
to living vegetables.

580
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,880
They're gone.

581
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,520
Are you all right?

582
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,400
- That was a Morlock, was it?
- Yes.

583
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,360
Don't you worry.
The fire seems to keep them away.

584
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,240
What are you doing?

585
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,320
Why did you put your hand in the fire?

586
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,160
I never saw it before.

587
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,680
No knowledge of fire.

588
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,800
No books.

589
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,280
I'm terribly sorry.

590
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,240
I'm sorry I was angry with your people.
I had no right to be.

591
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,360
No more than if I'd visited
the island of Bali in my own time.

592
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,760
But, you know, Weena...

593
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:11,040
You were safe inside your great house,
yet came out into the night to warn me.

594
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,840
The characteristic which distinguished man
from the animal kingdom...

595
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,880
...was the spirit of self-sacrifice.

596
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,000
And you have that quality.

597
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,160
I think all your people have it, really.
It just needs someone to reawaken it.

598
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,080
I'd like to try if you'd let me.

599
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,080
Will you?

600
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,640
I do not understand...

601
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,320
...but I believe you.

602
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,320
That's as good a start as any.

603
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,680
Try to tell me. The Morlocks.
Who or what are the Morlocks?

604
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,120
Are they animals or people?

605
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,680
What about yourself?

606
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,200
The past? Don't you people ever speak
of the past?

607
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,360
There is no past.

608
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,520
Do they ever wonder about the future?

609
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,760
There is no future.

610
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,720
The past...

611
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,520
...man's past...

612
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,760
...is mainly a grim struggle for survival.

613
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,680
But there have been moments
when a few voices have spoken up...

614
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,160
...and these rare moments have made
the history of man, man's past...

615
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,280
...a glorious thing.

616
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,920
I refuse to believe it's dead and gone.

617
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,840
We've had our dark ages before
and this is just another one of them.

618
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,600
All it needs is someone
to show you the way out.

619
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,320
I'm only a tinkering mechanic but...

620
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,920
...I’m sure there must be a hidden spark
in one of your people.

621
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,000
If only I can kindle that spark...

622
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,000
...my coming here will have some meaning.

623
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,280
My efforts the next morning
to open the panel were fruitless.

624
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,480
I had to find another way
to retrieve my machine.

625
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:28,960
Listen.

626
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,720
Do you hear that?

627
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,120
Yes.

628
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,560
Machines?

629
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,800
No, Morlocks.

630
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,120
You mean, those animals run machines?

631
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,040
They are Morlocks.

632
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,200
But have you ever seen the machines?

633
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,120
No, only heard of them.

634
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,240
Who told you?

635
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,800
The rings.

636
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,440
What sort of rings?

637
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,120
Rings that talk.

638
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,560
Could you show me these talking rings?

639
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,000
Come, this way!

640
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,480
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.

641
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,040
They speak?

642
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,120
Of what?

643
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,000
Things no one here understands.

644
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,640
Make it talk.

645
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,120
The war between the East and West...

646
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,120
...which is now in its 326th year...

647
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,440
...has at last come to an end.

648
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,560
There is nothing left to fight with,
and few of us left to fight.

649
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,280
The atmosphere has become so polluted
with deadly germs...

650
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,800
...that it can no longer be breathed.

651
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,520
There is no place on this planet
that is immune.

652
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,400
The last surviving factory
for the manufacture of oxygen...

653
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,800
...has been destroyed.

654
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,040
Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing...

655
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,000
...and when they are gone, we must die.

656
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,640
My name is of no consequence.

657
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,160
The important thing you should know is...

658
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,520
...that I am the last who remembers
how each of us...

659
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,200
...man and woman...

660
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,520
...made his own decision.

661
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,600
Some chose to take refuge
in the great caverns...

662
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,440
...and find a new way of life
far below the earth's surface.

663
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,560
The rest of us decided
to take our chances in the sunlight...

664
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,840
...small as those chances might be.

665
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,200
From the talking rings I learned
how the human race divided itself...

666
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,960
...and how the world of the Eloi
and the Morlocks began.

667
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,080
By some awful quirk of fate...

668
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,080
...the Morlocks had become the masters
and the Eloi their servants.

669
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,840
The Morlocks maintained them
and bred them like...

670
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,760
...cattle.

671
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:28,200
Only to take them below
when they reached maturity.

672
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,600
Which explained why there were
no older people among them.

673
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,000
I knew I must go below.

674
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,760
It was the only means of finding a way
up into the sphinx to reach my machine...

675
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,520
...and discover what happened to them
when they went below.

676
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,120
Don't go!

677
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,480
You won't come back!

678
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,160
I'll be back.

679
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:13,920
Weena!

680
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,320
Answer me!

681
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,920
Where are you?

682
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,120
What's happening?

683
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,840
What's happening?

684
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,160
What's the matter with you all?

685
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,360
Weena, stop!

686
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,080
Stop!

687
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,800
What happens to them?

688
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,320
Don't stand there like fattened cattle!
Will you answer me?

689
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,960
What is wrong?

690
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,960
There is nothing wrong. It is all clear.

691
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,480
What do you mean, "All clear"?

692
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,080
All clear.

693
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,640
In the middle of the 1900s,
the falling bombs, the people calling out:

694
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,800
"All clear!"

695
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,360
No!

696
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,560
That's gone! That's passed!

697
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,480
There's no more flying machines!
No more bombs! No more wars!

698
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,400
The rings have told us that story.

699
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,840
But you didn't listen!
You didn't learn anything!

700
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,240
It was ages ago that men were taught...

701
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,840
...to hide below the ground
when the sirens blew...

702
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,160
...to run from death, but it's over!

703
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,840
Those men are dead.

704
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,120
The men who slaughtered them are dead!

705
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:39,520
But there is nothing to fear. It is all clear.

706
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,880
What about the ones who went below?

707
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,040
How do you think they're going
to come back?

708
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,920
They never come back.

709
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,640
Nobody can bring them back.

710
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,680
You can try. You can try!

711
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,680
Won't even one of you try?

712
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,560
Well, I'll try!

713
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,320
So, this was the destiny of the Eloi.

714
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,120
They were being bred by the Morlocks...

715
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,560
...who had degenerated
into the lowest form of human life:

716
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,720
Cannibalism!

717
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,320
Weena, wake up!

718
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,240
Come to your senses! All of you!

719
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:40,840
Burn.

720
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,160
Give me something to burn.
It's my last match.

721
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,480
Get up the stairs!
That's the way out! Quickly!

722
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,040
The torch!

723
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,920
Get the torch!

724
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,400
Get up the stairs! Hurry up!

725
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,520
Get all the dead wood! Come on!
All the wood!

726
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,240
That's fine.

727
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,840
Come on, throw it down!

728
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,960
All the dead wood!

729
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,720
Throw it down!

730
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,720
Do the same to the other wells!

731
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,960
All the wood down the well!

732
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,760
All right, to the river! Come on!
Back to the river!

733
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,960
All right, let's go!

734
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,840
Another night was coming,
but this night no Eloi needed to fear.

735
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,720
The underworld
of the Morlocks was gone...

736
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,800
...and so was the life of leisure for the Eloi.

737
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,560
But then what of me?

738
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:16,000
I was imprisoned in a world
in which I just did not belong.

739
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,520
Are you sorry?

740
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,760
Sorry? Sorry for what?

741
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,520
That you have to stay?

742
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,800
Yes.

743
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,240
I'm sorry because I could tell so much
to the people of my time.

744
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,280
I could let them know...

745
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,760
...about the sorrow and the happiness
that the future has in store for them.

746
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,720
Maybe they could learn from it.

747
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,200
Or could they?

748
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,120
You don't want to stay, do you?

749
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,360
It isn't that.

750
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,760
It's just that I don't really fit here...

751
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,000
...any more than you would in my time.

752
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,840
I would love to see your time.

753
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,960
You wouldn't be very happy there.

754
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:07,080
Do you have someone there?
Someone like me?

755
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,800
No one like you.

756
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,440
I have friends, of course.

757
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,200
Friends who will miss me.

758
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,880
As a matter of fact,
I'm probably late already.

759
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,640
Women?

760
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,400
No.

761
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,440
There is one woman.

762
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,000
She looks after my house for me.

763
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,400
She's 62 years old, all wrinkled,
and nothing like you.

764
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,840
How do they wear their hair?

765
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,240
- Who?
- The women of your time.

766
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,120
Up.

767
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,640
"Up"?

768
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,600
Up how?

769
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,840
I don't know. Kind of... up like that!

770
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:00,800
Show me!

771
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,520
Would I be pretty?

772
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,120
Yes, you would. Very pretty.

773
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,680
I wish we could go back to my time.

774
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,760
Or even at a time before that,
when the world was young.

775
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,440
We could be so very happy.

776
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,640
Look!

777
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,520
My machine!

778
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,720
Come on, Weena!

779
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,480
I was going the wrong way!

780
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,920
Back! Back! I had to go back!

781
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,240
It's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard.

782
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,920
Absolutely preposterous!

783
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:24,040
There's one thing I'll say for old George,
you always could tell a good yarn.

784
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,720
You're a truly great inventor, George.

785
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,960
I think you ought to retire.

786
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,640
Well, truthfully, George...

787
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,880
...where have you been the past week?

788
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,200
You shouldn't ask such questions, Walter.

789
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:41,560
It is not hard for a man
to lose a little week, now and again.

790
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:48,160
I can understand your doubt, my friends.
Take it as a lie if you wish.

791
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,000
I scarcely believe it myself,
now that I'm back.

792
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,080
David, there's the flower Weena gave me.

793
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,200
David, a present for you.

794
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,800
You're interested in botany. Try to match
that with any species known today!

795
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,440
I don't think I can.

796
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,440
Time to go, Bridewell.

797
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,680
Yes, it is getting late.

798
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,200
Good night, George.

799
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,680
Good night, George.

800
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,520
You look exhausted, George.
You really should get some rest.

801
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:01,560
Good night, George.
It's grand having you back.

802
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,640
Goodbye, David.

803
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,360
Thanks for being such a good friend.

804
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,440
Always.

805
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,040
What do you think, Filby?

806
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,280
One thing is certain.

807
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,320
That flower couldn't possibly have bloomed
in the wintertime.

808
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,160
You don't really believe
that story's true, do you?

809
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,440
Good night.

810
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,280
Go on.

811
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,440
He's gone!

812
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,040
Look!

813
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,840
I think I understand. You see the imprint?

814
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,640
This is where the time machine
originally stood.

815
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,000
The Morlocks moved it.

816
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,200
They dragged it across the lawn...

817
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,520
...right into the sphinx.

818
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,680
Right there.

819
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,000
Weena was standing here...

820
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,280
...when he last saw her.

821
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:10,400
Right here!

822
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,360
The same space in a different time.

823
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,600
He dragged his heavy machine...

824
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,120
...back in here...

825
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,440
...scratching the floor...

826
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,080
...so he could appear
outside the sphinx again...

827
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,560
...and help the Eloi build a new world.

828
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,640
Build a new world for himself.

829
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,520
Right where he left her.

830
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,560
Yes.

831
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,840
It's not like George
to return empty-handed.

832
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,640
To try to rebuild a civilization
without a plan.

833
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,560
He must have taken something with him.

834
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,800
Nothing.

835
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,200
Except three books.

836
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,200
Which three books?

837
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,320
I don't know.

838
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,160
Is it important?

839
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,040
I suppose not.

840
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:21,960
Only...

841
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,520
...which three books
would you have taken?

842
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,920
Mr. Filby, do you think he'll ever return?

843
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,720
One cannot choose but wonder.

844
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:38,880
You see...

845
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,360
...he has all the time in the world.

846
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:23,440
