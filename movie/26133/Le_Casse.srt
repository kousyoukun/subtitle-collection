LE CASSE(THE BURGLAR)

3
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:13,748
Turn off the lights!

4
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:43,428
Stop,your on the production numbers

5
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,513
Set them to zero!

6
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,870
Wait here!

7
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,380
It's all a car?

8
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:44,881
it's my friend, but it broke

9
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,357
What's up wih it?

10
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,205
that would be me too interested.

11
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:54,650
Not bland service near hear?

12
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:57,540
I walked up the street,but
every thing is closed.

13
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,341
At this hour nights heavy.

14
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,785
do you carry documents?

15
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,323
It hope so

16
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,583
Sells for business or pleasure ...?

17
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:14,451
For business

18
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
earn your living with this?

19
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:39,616
it depends on how often the
car breaks down.

20
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,693
would you should not take
me back to town?

21
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:12,175
I would like, but you know what? ... Some of our laws are strict

22
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:16,955
I can't take you into the car, if you're not arrests

23
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:20,175
aahh ... so I'll have to sleep in the car until morning

24
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:22,036
Good Luck

25
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,184
Thanks

26
00:23:58,544 --> 00:24:00,100
You okay?

27
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,923
Yeah

28
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:04,405
E, M, P, S

29
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:06,936
E, M, P, S

30
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:35,449
Leave the money will be marked

31
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:23,050
What's wrong?

32
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,040
I do not understand

33
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,930
 - What is the name the boat?
Arax, there was supposed to dock last night

34
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:31,486
So the hell you find
out it's your task!

35
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:41,829
Hello, here you have not seen the ship on behalf of the Arax?

36
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:48,650
Arax Beit was supposed to have
arrived 2 in the morning,

37
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:50,831
they saw her entering the harbor ...
that's all they know

38
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,150
inquire around  the harbor, so it's got to be somewhere

39
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:55,300
I talked to Captain month ago, everything was appointed

40
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:57,600
Was he a professional ?

41
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,761
2000 Baku advance, 4 persons.

42
00:25:59,762 --> 00:26:02,261
-Damn well knew it would
not be on a cruise trip.

43
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:09,432
Well,  if not here, so we go looking for it

44
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:24,315
Could we go another ship?

45
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:29,876
They could,but I need the captain who does not ask questions

46
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,010
Slight damage during a
storm, nothing big.

47
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:52,010
The boat will be ready in 5 days.

48
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:52,865
Shit.

49
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:55,115
- I can not help it
I too cant leave now.

50
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:57,020
Are you sure that the captain does not-

51
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:58,700
-change the view to see our papers?

52
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:04,094
Still true to what we agreed.
5 days of waiting, no problems.

53
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:44,617
Stop! Get out of the car!

54
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,559
Renzi, you go to the end of the
pier and wait there for us.

55
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,059
We should go over to the factory.
I'll meet you there.

56
00:29:54,162 --> 00:29:56,812
Are you crazy?
There's no reason to go there.

57
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:59,462
- Well, I hope not,but now just
do as you are told, noquestions  asked

58
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,090
What are you doing?

59
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:43,512
The cop followed us up here,

60
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:46,612
we have to whisper a few days and
hide the diamonds somewhewer.

61
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:49,691
Hide it here in the
factory in the mean time,

62
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:51,650
So that they did not
know who is carrying it

63
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:52,400
Where?

64
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:54,873
Dont worry about the rest!

65
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,850
Wait here!

66
00:31:58,632 --> 00:32:00,916
Ralph and you ... go back to your
toy factory to take to cover,

67
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:03,200
You will be fine just dont get spotted

68
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:06,200
Do you think that you know
a gardener from the villa?

69
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:09,193
- I am afraid that yes, we have been there 3 times
when I posing for photography works by umìlìckej

70
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:13,310
Well then, you'll have to get out here

71
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:21,413
I'll let you know where I will.
- OK.

72
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,319
Great first class hotel ...
what ...?

73
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,319
- I've spent here more days of our preparation,
So here you four days too.

74
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:11,588
Atleast send me on my way"happily"?

75
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,100
Day when you leave "happily"away is the day, when  you and i are out of here together...

76
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:19,204
Do not forget to call me every day to the bar at the Hilton! And now get on your way!

77
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,010
You know it's illegal to
break the speed limit?

78
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:41,380
- Sorry, I'm a foreigner, I can not
read the tags in your language.

79
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:44,959
Numbers are the same in all languages

80
00:43:48,082 --> 00:43:55,027
We are very mild to foreigners, provided they do not go to far..

81
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:06,280
Do you have point how fast you went ?
- 20, 30?

82
00:44:07,651 --> 00:44:09,651
40?

83
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:11,412
50?

84
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,441
No. ..!
do not tell me that I rode in the middle of town...sixty  ...

85
00:44:15,537 --> 00:44:17,780
You went till 90.

86
00:44:18,097 --> 00:44:20,597
- What? That is my foot
had to hack the throttle.

87
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:23,097
... usually I'm very
careful to keep it under controls

88
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:39,119
You have the luck that
you stumbled upon me.

89
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,690
-Perhaps another officer would you
immediately confiscated your papers.

90
00:44:49,775 --> 00:44:55,500
your name Mr ... Mr? - Azad. That means "being free" to certain language

91
00:44:56,377 --> 00:45:01,777
My name is Abel Zacharie and it does not mean anything.

92
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:53,776
Inspector Zacharie.
- Hello Inspector, my name
is Malloch,I represent the insurance company

93
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:58,567
Mr. Tasco now awaits you. He had just returned from St. Moøice private plane.

94
00:45:59,572 --> 00:46:00,690
Hello Folks

95
00:46:01,316 --> 00:46:02,700
yeah .. that's nice of you ...

96
00:46:05,308 --> 00:46:12,246
Anne darling, you're in St. Moøici. I'm calling you from home. We came back this morning

97
00:46:12,894 --> 00:46:18,831
we were robbed.
Our emeralds. the entire set.

98
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:25,521
I'll let tatk to Isabel, the police are here. Isabel

99
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,700
oohh dear .... you have see the police
only in thrillers.

100
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:32,951
 In the real world are not so
good,

101
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:35,200
-Investigating the crime scene and then forget the whole case

102
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:38,987
Hello... yes.

103
00:46:40,086 --> 00:46:43,926
I was pretty upset .... ... Yes!

104
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:46,275
I think I told the police that no one did.

105
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:50,700
Are you serious? .. Clearly that we can change our plans ...

106
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,800
From now, every two weeks we go to sea with boat in the tropics. The ship is ready

107
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:07,700
Okay ... now I assume that you already have a clue about anyone who could do it.

108
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:15,556
Sir Tasco. I know that you're losing your precious emeralds, but never ask a police officer if he has a clue

109
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:18,753
Really? And why not?

110
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:21,835
Just superstion

111
00:47:22,158 --> 00:47:27,158
The thieves capture your moving among millions of other people you need to have a little faith

112
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:30,071
you have to belive in something supernatural.

113
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:33,112
I believe in it..

114
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:37,872
Police's greatest strength is that they take things as they are comming
They never follow a case

115
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:41,056
Can i ?
- Depending on your
preferences ...

116
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:50,212
Steal nothing but a set of emerald ....

117
00:47:50,213 --> 00:47:53,430
complete the big price,
one million dollar.

118
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:56,376
they must be professionals.

119
00:48:02,817 --> 00:48:09,217
This will be your inspector ,but if you find my emeralds.

120
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:14,150
And my company is ready to pay the reward in %.

121
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:18,019
Well gentlemen,we could
probably upgrade our equipment.

122
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,900
i'm sure we could have used

123
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,347
If I were you,I would
certainly prefer a new car.

124
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:25,200
By the way, I heared you conversation.

125
00:48:25,758 --> 00:48:28,058
and it will certainly improve the situation..

126
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:33,278
Your commision will be a
fortune beyond imiganation...

127
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,588
-So i suggest that you
get to work immediately

128
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:41,498
Catch these bunch of thives,

129
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:44,798
and perhaps recover the items

130
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:54,628
Surely i will....

131
00:50:29,205 --> 00:50:33,305
Miss ...!
- You can take the  bar here, sir.

132
00:50:37,684 --> 00:50:40,422
Hello ....
yes, its Mr.Azad.

133
00:50:40,423 --> 00:50:43,160
I'll get it here at the bar.

134
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:46,917
Hey Leno ...

135
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,717
Aaah , and what about you?

136
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:51,402
Do you like the hotel?

137
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:54,833
The hotel is good,right on the bay.

138
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,024
great ...! Potebovalas holiday.

139
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:03,300
I want to ask for something
you will not mind if i go out?

140
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:08,447
Sure you can
- i think "with anyone"

141
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:13,544
why not? But you do not say much!
- You,do not mind?

142
00:51:13,545 --> 00:51:18,192
why would milo, when you
invites someone to go.

143
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:21,470
well i just wanted you to know...

144
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:23,377
know what?

145
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:26,715
I could go out with a man

146
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,968
What is this? ... riddle?
This is the first time.

147
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:32,919
-Why did you ask
that kind of thing

148
00:51:33,138 --> 00:51:35,686
because it is the first time that I go out without you

149
00:51:35,995 --> 00:51:37,014
Hey, listen, close the phone.

150
00:51:37,015 --> 00:51:38,033
If you weres to throw money at

151
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:40,071
-that kind of phone calls.
you will not have the money to go out.

152
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,470
Call me tomorrow at the  same time.

153
00:52:09,555 --> 00:52:12,004
Shame ...

154
00:52:12,442 --> 00:52:16,442
But you have to like

155
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:26,329
Now you can have dreams over the bed.

156
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:30,859
Then i would never sleep instead one look at you 
and immediatelygo to my stick

157
00:52:37,443 --> 00:52:43,979
can i?- Sure.
Now that i am a  intimate friend of yours.

158
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:50,066
Foods okay?
- depends on the photographer.

159
00:52:50,464 --> 00:52:53,942
If I was a photographer ...
- But you're not.

160
00:52:53,943 --> 00:52:57,420
The view as staring at
me is completely out.

161
00:52:57,729 --> 00:53:00,388
could you.....?
- No, you can!

162
00:53:01,036 --> 00:53:03,475
posing for magazines.

163
00:53:04,462 --> 00:53:08,290
you do not mind pose naked just like that?
- No.

164
00:53:08,845 --> 00:53:12,598
You know, two years ago, I showed
only a leg and I was afraid.

165
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:16,350
But now more open and fear
less, it is particularly good? is it?

166
00:53:16,322 --> 00:53:20,690
Previously people've read this
somewhere at home alone in

167
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:25,058
hiding and now every one in public
will read it and I'm afraid.

168
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,354
But now.. It is fun.
Drinking leads to detoxification,

169
00:53:30,355 --> 00:53:35,007
drugs lead to psychatrovi, but sex?
What I say sex makes us fall in love

170
00:53:41,106 --> 00:53:44,350
he did not want to let you take a picture?
You are looking for a man

171
00:53:44,356 --> 00:53:46,820
i have  one rule: "Never try to replace
thethe real thing"

172
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:50,016
Right, but that does not
mean that you e nenauil.

173
00:53:50,017 --> 00:53:52,766
- Who is the teacher?
Well perhaps me, it is perhaps not more!

174
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:11,536
The greatest night club in the
world, El Dorado. This is heaven or

175
00:54:11,537 --> 00:54:16,036
-this is hell ,the show will unexpectedly catch you by surprise
and leave you captivated

176
00:54:24,485 --> 00:54:25,725

177
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,526

180

181
00:57:39,476 --> 00:57:44,476

So, do you like the show?

Oh by the way, my name is Helen,
what's your name? - Azad. Azad.

184
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:41,323
That does not sound exactly like
the name of a native citizen.

185
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:48,888
You come here? - Not really, just  with their dolls. With the dolls?

186
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:56,278
Selling dolls so that I could spend time with people in the bar.

As you can see,i'm waiting for you.

190
00:59:24,243 --> 00:59:27,422
I hate to drink alone.

191
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:34,073
I see that you're were only two of you.

192
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:39,188
What do you want?

193
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:45,198
Emerald. - We do not know anything.

194
00:59:52,601 --> 01:00:05,045
Come on! Do make rash decision, and die? 
We are here not some kind of unexpected situation.

195
01:00:05,055 --> 01:00:06,875
Please be seated.

196
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:26,672
I wanted to offer yousome thing to drink.

It is a long time since I last drank
First a glass

198

01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:42,117
preety bad, generally speaking, I never missed the target.

200
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:52,910
a second glass of

201
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:50,530
If I had some sense, so
I'd go drinking.

202
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:08,591
Where are the emeralds?
- Listen Inspector,

203
01:03:08,592 --> 01:03:14,100

207
01:03:29,295 --> 01:03:33,785
Calm down .... I came alone ...

208
01:03:36,723 --> 01:03:46,264
The latest magazine ....

... my ability to objective measurements of beit
higher starts getting more neposena ...

209
01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:52,092
Where are the emeralds?

210
01:04:43,985 --> 01:04:52,900

Good evening, Mr Azad .. ... remember you have me?

214
01:05:28,973 --> 01:05:31,703
small town can not make...

215
01:05:31,704 --> 01:05:33,068
two steps without so

216
01:05:33,069 --> 01:05:34,432
that no one noticed...

217
01:05:37,364 --> 01:05:40,104
eating fries ... 
the best thing both

218
01:05:40,105 --> 01:05:42,843
for themselves to attract attention.

219
01:05:45,788 --> 01:05:48,519
Same as usual .... twice

220
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:52,000
For Mr. Zacharie, twice.

221
01:05:52,136 --> 01:05:54,030
But please .... ...
do not worry!

222
01:05:54,031 --> 01:05:55,923
Today you'r my guest.

223
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:00,522
Otherwise confidentially "I never pay"

224
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:40,898
Tell me ,Inspector, what is your  specialty?

225
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:45,340
controls are by instinct ...
... chasing all sort of villians, as you may be you.

226
01:06:45,698 --> 01:06:50,025
I take all the risks 300 dollar a month...
... do not you think it shameful?

227
01:06:50,475 --> 01:06:59,475
But it it has its advantages... you go to your car,
"ypu can Beit where you want to pay in restaurants
and doing what you would like to

228
01:07:20,947 --> 01:07:26,947
One good point is a good start ...
... where are the emeralds?

229
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:31,323
Just as it ?.... you say?

230
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:37,150
Dolmades ...
this is rice wrapped in vine liskach from marinated in olive oil.

231
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,899
Taste it!
it has excellent

232
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,597
taste on the tongue.

233
01:07:47,426 --> 01:07:52,426
for the last 24 hours, we
were like two strangers

234
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:58,105
Oohh ... I've eaten for twenty years, that's my whole life, now that I can not go.

235
01:07:58,684 --> 01:08:03,150
Watching people like you, I came to believe that you have vivid taste.

236
01:08:03,558 --> 01:08:07,119
So I've decided that you alone of something we do too.

237
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,408
Since when?
...

238
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:13,295
- The roberty yesterday night,near the  villa there, when you
took my car keys I thought that it was going to start ..

239
01:08:13,794 --> 01:08:16,255
Also because I tried to boot ...

240
01:08:16,632 --> 01:08:18,372
But bribe for a cop ?....

241
01:08:19,673 --> 01:08:22,611
.. Everyone have something to do, but you want to do both.
There will be complications.

242
01:08:22,852 --> 01:08:26,087
No, not at all. It's very simple.

243
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:31,829
I'll play on both sides. If things turns bad settlement begins to play nice cop again.

244
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,903
So why not, where are the emeralds?

245
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,783
You're really decadent,
man ...

246
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:45,389
Decadent ?.... oohh, yes, but smooth.

247
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:51,863
I will give you time to digest. Think about it.
Do you have time for tomorrow afternoon.

248
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:57,756
Until then, we give the emeralds in person,
otherwise I will send you a grill.

249
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:07,170
just about that?

250
01:09:08,032 --> 01:09:13,060
I want the whole collection, i do not take things in half.

251
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:18,170
What will I get if I  receiving your offer?
- Freedom, Mr. Azad.

252
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:22,587
You and your friends will be able to leave the city without fearing
the law.

253
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:30,586
Come on, Mr. Azad. I offer you the chance to go on and live your life.

254
01:09:34,161 --> 01:09:38,702
This is good, what is it?

255
01:09:39,214 --> 01:09:43,934
This is called "Imam Bayildi.
(Imam in bìzvìdomí)

256
01:09:43,935 --> 01:09:48,653
 Legend has it that a man who's  fainted when he tasted it.
So then this man called it.

257
01:09:49,212 --> 01:09:53,718
This is how it will be even better.

258
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:59,788
Not bad ....
.. and what are you eating?

259
01:10:00,073 --> 01:10:05,073
It is "Moussaka (Greece national dish).
A single layer of eggplant,

260
01:10:05,074 --> 01:10:10,073
A layer of minced meat libovìjšího with local herbs
(mint, nutmeg oøíšek, skoøice bit ..)

261

263
01:10:27,696 --> 01:10:32,373

264
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:39,378
It depends .... kouknìte Maybe at this! This is zapeèený soft cheese with flour and butter ... ...

265
01:10:52,073 --> 01:10:55,373
You did not want a little taste?
- No, thank you.

266
01:10:55,892 --> 01:10:59,616
Are you not hungry? ...
... I hope I will not spoil the taste? ..

267
01:10:59,933 --> 01:11:04,250
And you know, yes. I am satisfied with my eating the grilled steak

268
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:09,560
... But it was my aim. You wanted to eat everything is all alone Mr. Azad. Well, then

271
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:24,875
Oh, and Mr. Azad, remain
overnight in town or not?

272
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:29,875

273
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,875
That it's for me

285
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:26,848

Rope. I get a medal on a podum.

288
01:14:44,057 --> 01:14:50,614
Always a cheating cop killer.
- This is gonna take my chances.

289
01:14:51,163 --> 01:14:55,714
The death of your friend .... it was an accident

290
01:14:56,288 --> 01:15:01,439
What are you doing? Tooth? and tongue!

291
01:15:01,848 --> 01:15:07,913
This could go out completely alone. Vystøelím and do not have any teeth, nor a tongue ...

292
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:24,190
... But you're still alive. Alive without taste. No more wine list, no Dolmados. Maybe there ...

293
01:15:26,571 --> 01:15:28,356
or here

294
01:15:29,034 --> 01:15:33,234
pieces fly here and there back flips

295
01:15:33,574 --> 01:15:40,380

296
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:50,391
but what is between them ... no brains .. just passing through daily light

297
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:55,781
Listen, I've just come to negotiate business

298

300
01:16:05,949 --> 01:16:13,871
I've come to it. I should stop here, you will have one eye and paralised.

301
01:16:14,851 --> 01:16:24,777
Your perceptible is 50:50.

01:33:21,443 --> 01:33:35,443
That's Life!
Good whiskey, comfortable room, nice pictures, but too much light.

356
01:33:39,836 --> 01:33:42,495

01:33:42,847 --> 01:33:47,847
One clap on off, two on power.

01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:54,021
This is the only game you have?
- No, I still have another game ...

01:33:56,259 --> 01:34:00,539
... Very sexy.
- What is it?

360
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:10,070
Close your eyes!

361
01:34:10,617 --> 01:34:13,206
... And now I stop
where you want to...

362
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:32,175
That's a good ...
- The rule of chance. Can not argue against the decision of fate

363
01:34:32,496 --> 01:34:36,295
So when I was in the hands of fate ...

364
01:34:43,097 --> 01:34:46,297

365

367
01:36:05,518 --> 01:36:10,789
Which one do you prefer? Cop or thieves?

368
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:15,359
You gave me time to assess ... ..

369
01:36:18,215 --> 01:36:20,215
Leave it ...

370
01:36:30,728 --> 01:36:35,728
That's why you take me to your show here?

371
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:42,860
I've done it for Zacharie. Been since you guys somehow biased.

372
01:36:42,996 --> 01:36:47,996
You put on me to have spied on me.
- Yes, but tell why ...
.

373
01:36:52,448 --> 01:36:55,550
From the first moment I met you I had guessed.

374
01:36:55,860 --> 01:37:01,121
I was taken as a tourist ...
... The only thing I need is a camera posing around my  neck
.

375
01:37:01,421 --> 01:37:03,631
What kind of a mess ....

378
01:37:19,749 --> 01:37:24,149
Even better, you're proud of yourself?

379
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:29,000
OK,get ready to go with me!

Ohh, no.

381
01:37:31,859 --> 01:37:34,465
- Oh ... no? Shame. Zacourious's supposed to be a
little better with the thieves being a cop.

382
01:37:34,695 --> 01:37:39,695
Another reason why pojedet with me. Let's go!
