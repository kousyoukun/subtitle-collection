1
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:23,490
Switch on.

2
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:53,554
Stop, you're on the serial number.

3
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,635
Set the dials on zero.

4
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:48,043
Wait here.

5
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,246
Is this your car?

6
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:56,533
It belongs to a friend.
It broke down.

7
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:01,162
What's wrong with it?

8
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:07,151
That's what I'd like to know.
ls there a garage around here?

9
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:09,031
I walked up the road a mile or two,
everything's closed.

10
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:10,784
At this time of night, no wonder.

11
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:13,424
Do you have your papers, please?

12
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:15,079
Hope so.

13
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:24,216
Salesman...
Business trip, or pleasure?

14
00:22:24,557 --> 00:22:25,766
Business.

15
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,156
You make a living with that?

16
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,071
It depends...
On how often the oar breaks down.

17
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,420
Could you give me a ride back to town?

18
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,656
I'd like to, but you know some
of our regulations are strange.

19
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:29,016
I can't take you in my car
unless you're under arrest.

20
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:32,123
OK then, I'll sleep
in the oar till daylight.

21
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:33,843
Good luck. Enjoy your visit.

22
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:35,141
Thanks.

23
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:12,608
OK?

24
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:14,111
OK.

25
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,591
E, M, P, S.

26
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,131
E, M, P, S.

27
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:46,335
Leave those, the numbers must be recorded.

28
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:35,255
What's going on?

29
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:39,575
- I don't get it. - What's the name of your boat?
- The Arax, she should have docked last night.

30
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,767
Well find out, that's your job dammit!

31
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:02,824
The Arax was supposed to dock here,
at 2 am. She was seen entering the...

32
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:05,224
If she came into port,
she must be here some place.

33
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:07,264
I contacted the Captain a month ago,
it was all set.

34
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,837
You made it clear to him
it was an organized tour?

35
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,705
$2000 a head for third class passage...

36
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:14,277
he knew damned well
it wasn't a pleasure cruise.

37
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,327
Well, OK then. If it's not a
ghost ship we'll track her down.

38
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:36,763
Couldn't we take another boat?

39
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:41,695
It's possible, but we'd need a Captain
who won't ask questions.

40
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:04,089
Storm damage. Nothing serious...
she'll be ready to sail in five days.

41
00:29:04,113 --> 00:29:07,409
- Shit. - It's not my fault.
- I'm not blaming you.

42
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:10,610
You're sure the Captain won't change
his mind when he reads the papers?

43
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:15,389
Maybe he would, if he could read
In five days we sail, no problem.

44
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,575
Stop! Get out.

45
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:02,857
Renzi, you drive down to the end
of the dock and wait for us.

46
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:05,998
We're going through that silo.
We'll meet you there.

47
00:30:06,201 --> 00:30:07,698
You're crazy.
There's no reason to go through there.

48
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,328
I hope there's no reason. But right now,
you don't discuss, you do it.

49
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,412
What's going on?

50
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:54,664
We have to find somewhere to hide
the emeralds for a few days.

51
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:59,114
We can't carry them with us.

52
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:03,705
We'll hide them here and he won't
know if we've split them between us.

53
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:04,730
Where?

54
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,207
Don't worry, we'll pick
them up in five days.

55
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:26,101
Wait for me here.

56
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:13,755
Ralph, you and Renzi go back
to your hideout.

57
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,826
You'll be safe there,
nobody's seen you.

58
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,436
You think the caretaker at
the villa recognized you?

59
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,916
I'm afraid so, I went there three times
to take measurements for the carpeting.

60
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,318
Well, we've got to get you out of town.

61
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:32,333
- I'll phone and tell you where I am.
- Bye.

62
00:32:46,504 --> 00:32:49,760
Great... first class hotels, eh?

63
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:53,641
I stayed here two months getting ready,
you can stand it for five days.

64
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,845
Are you going to say goodbye to me nicely?

65
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,525
The day I say goodbye nicely,
you'll be leaving for China.

66
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:31,305
Don't forget to call me everyday at noon,
at the Hilton bar. Now go on.

67
00:43:47,516 --> 00:43:50,612
You know there's a speed
limit in this town?

68
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:53,775
Sorry, I'm a foreigner.
I can't read signs in your language.

69
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:56,964
Numbers are the same in any language.

70
00:44:00,517 --> 00:44:07,241
We're very lenient with foreigners.
As long as they don't go too far.

71
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,492
- Do you know how fast you were going?
- Thirty, forty?

72
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,818
Fifty?

73
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:24,582
Sixty?

74
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:28,635
No! Don't tell me I was doing seventy,
right in the middle of town...

75
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,938
You were doing ninety.

76
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:33,658
My foot must have got wedged
on the accelerator.

77
00:44:33,682 --> 00:44:36,344
Usually I'm a very safe driver.

78
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:51,541
You're lucky you ran into me.

79
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:55,296
A traffic officer would have
confiscated your license.

80
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:05,142
Goodbye, Mister...
Mister?

81
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:08,693
Azad. It happens to mean
"Free" in certain languages.

82
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:14,292
My name is Abel Zacharia.
It means nothing at all.

83
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:02,830
Inspector Zacharia.

84
00:46:02,854 --> 00:46:06,911
Good morning Inspector, my name is
Malloch. I represent the insurance company.

85
00:46:06,935 --> 00:46:08,271
Mr. Tasco is waiting for you.

86
00:46:08,295 --> 00:46:11,618
He just came back from St. Moritz
in his private plane.

87
00:46:12,496 --> 00:46:13,895
Hello, Lydia...

88
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:15,888
having fun, I hope...

89
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:21,709
No, no darling...
I'm not in St. Moritz anymore.

90
00:46:22,097 --> 00:46:25,465
I just got back this morning.

91
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:31,654
My emeralds. The whole collection.

92
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:38,503
I'll pass you to Isabel,
the Police are here. Isabel!

93
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:42,615
Oh darling! You read too
many detective stories.

94
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,476
In reality they're
not all that brilliant...

95
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,663
they fill up their files with
papers and forget the whole case.

96
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,189
Hello? Yes.

97
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:57,158
I'm very upset about it. Yes.

98
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:59,480
I think the police did send somebody.

99
00:47:00,182 --> 00:47:03,719
You're mad!
Of course we won't change our plans.

100
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:09,387
In two weeks we'll be sailing for
the tropics. The crew is all ready...

101
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:20,761
Well. I suppose there's no use
asking if you've found a lead?

102
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:25,362
Mr. Tasco, I understand your impatience,
they're your emeralds...

103
00:47:25,386 --> 00:47:28,787
but never ask a policeman
if he's found a lead.

104
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,004
Oh really? Why not?

105
00:47:33,147 --> 00:47:35,035
Superstition.

106
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:40,404
To catch a thief vi/ho's Wandering around
amongst a million people, you must have faith.

107
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:43,704
You must believe in the supernatural.

108
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,353
I do believe.

109
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:49,565
A policeman's great strength
is that he's paid by the year.

110
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:51,523
He never files a case.

111
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,301
- May I?
- If you wish.

112
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:03,744
They took nothing but the emeralds.

113
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,968
The collection is valued
at one million dollars.

114
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:09,642
He must be a specialist.

115
00:48:17,073 --> 00:48:23,593
It's all yours, Inspector.
If you find my emeralds, of course.

116
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:27,436
My company is also prepared
to pay a reward often percent.

117
00:48:29,195 --> 00:48:32,971
Well gentlemen, perhaps
we'll be able to modernize our offices.

118
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:34,412
They could certainly use it.

119
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:36,852
If I were you, I'd also buy a new car.

120
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:38,692
We heard you coming a mile away...

121
00:48:38,716 --> 00:48:40,604
and burglars have pretty sharp ears.

122
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:49,158
Whether you make your name or
a fortune, isn't important.

123
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,829
What's important is that you recover
the emeralds and make a point.

124
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:57,812
We take revenge.

125
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,223
I'll get my revenge, Mr. Tasco.

126
00:50:43,693 --> 00:50:48,142
- Miss!
- You can take it at the bar, sir.

127
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,008
Hello? Yes, I'm Mr. Azad.
I'll take it here.

128
00:50:58,015 --> 00:51:01,019
Hello, Helene. Yes all's fine here.
And you?

129
00:51:01,816 --> 00:51:04,773
You like the place?
Found a good hotel?

130
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,033
Oh, the place is full of them
it's the local Riviera.

131
00:51:08,057 --> 00:51:11,193
Great! You needed a vacation.

132
00:51:11,217 --> 00:51:17,314
I wanted to ask you something.
Can I go out?

133
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:22,709
- What do you mean, of course you can.
- I mean with somebody.

134
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:28,224
- Why not? Just don't talk too much.
- You don't mind?

135
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,662
Why should I?
If somebody asks you, go ahead.

136
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,677
OK, I just wanted to know...

137
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:37,691
Know what?

138
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:40,387
If I could go out with a man.

139
00:51:40,621 --> 00:51:42,464
This is idiotic? What's your point?

140
00:51:42,702 --> 00:51:46,433
It's the first time you ever
asked me a question like that.

141
00:51:46,662 --> 00:51:49,079
Because it's the first time
I'll be going out without you.

142
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:52,319
Listen, hang up... if you waste
all your money on phone calls...

143
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:53,959
you won't be able to go out.

144
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,509
Call me tomorrow, same time.

145
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:25,148
Too bad.

146
00:52:27,788 --> 00:52:29,596
Like this.

147
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:40,168
Now you can pin it up over your bed.

148
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,736
I'd never get to sleep.
Just seeing you, I'm all wound up...

149
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:57,063
- May I? - Of course.
- Don't worry, I'm a nice guy.

150
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:03,909
- Does it pay well?
- Hmm, depending on the photographer.

151
00:53:04,593 --> 00:53:07,489
- If I was a photographer...
- Ah, but you're not.

152
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:11,250
The way you look at me,
your pictures would be out of focus.

153
00:53:11,274 --> 00:53:14,243
- I can dream can't I...
- No, you can't.

154
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:16,653
But console yourself,
I'm for sale at the news stand.

155
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:22,170
Doesn't it bother you to pose bare...
Like that?

156
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:25,913
You know, two years ago I only
showed my legs and that was shocking.

157
00:53:26,156 --> 00:53:28,532
Now I show more and it shocks less.

158
00:53:28,556 --> 00:53:30,195
It's really weird, isn't it?

159
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:34,213
People used to read these alone
in their hot little rooms, with...

160
00:53:34,237 --> 00:53:39,734
Now the cry is for sex in public.
That's what shocks me.

161
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,454
No, now come on.
As pleasures go, you know...

162
00:53:42,478 --> 00:53:46,055
drinking leads to the D.T.
and drugs lead to the madhouse...

163
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,060
but sex? Sex only leads to an act of love.

164
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,816
Would you like to pose?
We're looking for a man.

165
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,177
I have only one principle:
"Never try to replace a professional".

166
00:54:00,201 --> 00:54:03,057
Right, but that doesn't mean
you can't get educated.

167
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:06,324
- Who's the teacher?
- Follow the leader.

168
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:24,753
The most erotic nightclub in the world,
the El Dorado!

169
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:29,166
It is heaven and hell.
A unique and shocking spectacle...

170
00:54:38,046 --> 00:54:39,570
- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:54:40,366 --> 00:54:43,404
You wait right here, I'll be back
in a couple of seconds.

172
00:54:44,687 --> 00:54:50,824
"The most daring spectacle ever staged!
Here, direct from Hamburg..."

173
00:54:50,848 --> 00:54:57,385
Are Siegfried and Marlene,
in their super erotic number...

174
00:54:57,409 --> 00:54:59,832
The House of Love...

175
00:55:54,177 --> 00:55:58,363
Hello, Siggi. A glass of water, please.

176
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,774
Entertaining, no?

177
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:51,337
- By the way, my name is Helena. And yours?
- Azad.

178
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,457
Azad. A very dynamic first name, suits you.
And what do you do?

179
00:58:55,562 --> 00:59:01,179
I'm just passing through,
I sell children's dolls.

180
00:59:01,203 --> 00:59:02,932
I don't believe it.

181
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:08,197
I sell the dolls, then I can be dynamic
and spend time with people at the bar.

182
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:16,628
Look.

183
00:59:27,246 --> 00:59:29,545
Good evening, gentlemen.

184
00:59:34,847 --> 00:59:37,191
As you can see,
I've been waiting for you.

185
00:59:38,928 --> 00:59:40,657
I don't like to drink alone.

186
00:59:45,729 --> 00:59:47,947
I see there are only two of you.

187
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:52,116
What do you want?

188
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,606
- The emeralds.
- We don't know anything.

189
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:09,518
It's very imprudent to put down your gun.

190
01:00:09,932 --> 01:00:15,223
All kinds of accidents can happen,
if you're not careful.

191
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:18,101
Sit down please.

192
01:00:34,856 --> 01:00:40,476
I was going to offer you a drink.
But you're not reasonable.

193
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:48,637
It's been years since I had an
alcoholic drink. First glass.

194
01:01:00,979 --> 01:01:05,326
Now we'll see if alcohol effects my aim.

195
01:01:45,705 --> 01:01:50,666
Not very good, that. Normally
I never miss a bulls eye.

196
01:01:51,586 --> 01:01:56,058
Somehow I think that alcohol
and firearms don't go together.

197
01:02:01,628 --> 01:02:03,493
Second glass.

198
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:34,898
Listen to me, you can search the
place, you won't find anything.

199
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:37,720
Besides which, you're trespassing.

200
01:02:38,873 --> 01:02:41,273
That was for your first stupid remark.

201
01:02:42,953 --> 01:02:45,149
This is for the second.

202
01:02:46,154 --> 01:02:47,530
Bastard!

203
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:54,512
The alcohol is beginning to take effect.
I almost killed you.

204
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:05,072
If I were sensible,
I wouldn't drink anymore.

205
01:03:17,998 --> 01:03:20,217
Where are the emeralds?

206
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:23,612
Listen Inspector,
it wasn't us who hid them.

207
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,896
- The what?
- The emeralds.

208
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,833
A-ha, a confession.

209
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:37,858
Take a note sergeant,
they've confessed to everything.

210
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:46,008
Relax, I came all alone.

211
01:03:51,243 --> 01:03:53,529
The last clip.

212
01:03:55,243 --> 01:04:00,249
Better hurry - my aim is
getting considerably less accurate.

213
01:04:03,765 --> 01:04:05,698
Where are the emeralds?

214
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:10,342
- We don't know.
- Where if the man who can tell me?

215
01:04:12,846 --> 01:04:18,467
The effect on my reflexes has
removed my margin for error.

216
01:04:59,012 --> 01:05:07,012
You see? There's been an accident.
I have only one round left.

217
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:10,338
And I can't miss you at this range.

218
01:05:13,734 --> 01:05:15,453
Where is Azad?

219
01:05:33,637 --> 01:05:36,914
Hello Mr. Azad.
Remember me?

220
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:44,855
What a town.

221
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:48,280
You can't take two steps
without meeting someone you know.

222
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,512
Steak and French fries?

223
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,298
It's the best way to attract attention.

224
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:02,704
The usual. For two.

225
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:05,818
For Mr. Zacharia, for two!

226
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:10,779
- Oh really...
- Don't worry, tonight you're my guest.

227
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:14,304
Confidentially, I never pay here.

228
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,120
Tell me, what are local specialties?

229
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:57,172
Me, for instance...

230
01:06:57,409 --> 01:06:59,665
I chase petty crooks like you...

231
01:06:59,689 --> 01:07:02,626
I take all those risks for $300 a month.

232
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,946
Don't you find that outrageous?

233
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:07,586
You have fringe benefits...
you race around in your car...

234
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:11,267
you sit at whatever table you want
you don't pay in restaurants...

235
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:12,929
It all adds up.

236
01:07:35,854 --> 01:07:39,427
One good turn deserves another.
Where are the emeralds?

237
01:07:43,015 --> 01:07:45,597
Just for a... what do you call it?

238
01:07:45,816 --> 01:07:51,352
Dolma. It's rice, wrapped in
vine leaves, soaked in oil.

239
01:07:51,376 --> 01:07:53,720
Eat it. It loosens the tongue.

240
01:08:03,018 --> 01:08:06,624
The last 24 hours, we've
been like Siamese twins.

241
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:12,384
Oh, that's what I ate for twenty years,
it's my whole youth... it can't go on.

242
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:18,036
Rubbing elbows with someone like you,
a man acquires a taste for, luxury.

243
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,196
Now I've decided to work for
myself for a change.

244
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:24,917
- Since when?
- Since last night, in front of the villa...

245
01:08:24,941 --> 01:08:28,103
when I took the oars keys
I guessed everything.

246
01:08:28,301 --> 01:08:32,397
- That's why I didn't try the ignition.
- Very good, for a cop.

247
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:35,078
We've each got a job to do
but you want to do both...

248
01:08:35,102 --> 01:08:36,911
and that leads to complications.

249
01:08:37,383 --> 01:08:39,908
Not at all, it's very simple.

250
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:42,279
I play both sides.

251
01:08:42,303 --> 01:08:47,878
If things go wrong, I start
acting like a policeman again.

252
01:08:48,384 --> 01:08:50,830
So why don't you tell me,
where are the emeralds?

253
01:08:53,025 --> 01:08:55,197
You are really decadent.

254
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:59,235
Decadent, yes. But easygoing.

255
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:05,283
I'm giving you time to digest.
Think it over.

256
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:09,483
You have until 5 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon to hand over those.

257
01:09:09,507 --> 01:09:11,395
Otherwise, I'll throw you in jail.

258
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:22,012
We split?

259
01:09:22,989 --> 01:09:27,620
I want the whole collection
I won't accept conditions.

260
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:32,763
- What if I accept?
- Freedom, Mr. Azad.

261
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:36,864
You and your friends leave town
with no worries.

262
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:44,450
Come on Mr. Azad. I offer you the
possibility to go on living on steak.

263
01:09:49,633 --> 01:09:53,000
Hmm, that's good, what is it?

264
01:09:53,753 --> 01:09:56,154
It's called Imam Bayildi.

265
01:09:56,594 --> 01:10:03,051
The legend is that a Sultan fainted
when he tasted it.

266
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:04,678
So they named the dish after him.

267
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:07,238
It's better this way.

268
01:10:10,556 --> 01:10:14,037
Not bad.
And what are you eating?

269
01:10:14,356 --> 01:10:16,403
It's called Moussaka.

270
01:10:16,756 --> 01:10:19,453
One layer of sliced fried egg plant,

271
01:10:19,477 --> 01:10:22,893
one layer of ground meat,
seasoned with local herbs...

272
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:25,955
like mint, marjoram, a
little bit of cinnamon...

273
01:10:26,558 --> 01:10:30,654
another layer of egg plant,
a layer of fresh tomatoes...

274
01:10:30,678 --> 01:10:34,335
one layer of Bechamel sauce,
some grated cheese...

275
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,201
and the whole thing baked in the oven.

276
01:10:37,759 --> 01:10:41,856
And what is this delicacy you
don't want to share with me?

277
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,016
This is cod fish roe.

278
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,537
I see they like to mix
things up around here.

279
01:10:46,561 --> 01:10:48,937
That depends... Here,
look this for example is Kashere.

280
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:51,623
It's a fine cheese browned in butter.

281
01:11:06,123 --> 01:11:09,241
- Would you like to try some?
- No thanks.

282
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:13,460
You're not hungry anymore?
I hope I didn't spoil your appetite.

283
01:11:13,484 --> 01:11:18,286
You did, I was peacefully eating
a piece of grilled steak...

284
01:11:18,645 --> 01:11:21,682
That's what I objected to -
you wanted to eat all by yourself.

285
01:11:24,726 --> 01:11:30,358
I shall respect your privacy.
See you tomorrow, before 5 o'clock.

286
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:34,124
Here, it's easier to reflect
over a fine cigar.

287
01:11:34,447 --> 01:11:37,394
And, Mr. Azad, you are staying
in town, are you not?

288
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:40,881
Your face is very familiar
to our border police.

289
01:11:49,969 --> 01:11:51,244
It's on me.

290
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,701
I told you not to come near me.
What happened?

291
01:12:14,533 --> 01:12:18,332
- He just shot Renzi.
- Shit.

292
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:22,030
- You want to see a doctor?
- Forget it, it's not bad.

293
01:12:22,054 --> 01:12:23,862
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

294
01:12:26,374 --> 01:12:30,846
- You have Tasco's telephone number?
- Yes, why? - Give it to me.

295
01:12:33,255 --> 01:12:36,066
- Here.
- Let's go!

296
01:12:51,258 --> 01:12:54,739
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Mr. Tasco.

297
01:12:55,419 --> 01:13:01,813
This is Santa Claus. No, it's not a gag.
Tell him it's about the emeralds.

298
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:09,757
Hello, Mr. Tasco, be at Inspector
Zacharia's office at 5 tomorrow afternoon...

299
01:13:09,781 --> 01:13:11,999
if you want your emeralds back.

300
01:13:48,226 --> 01:13:51,707
I'm going to see a friend.
Pick me up in half an hour.

301
01:14:35,072 --> 01:14:40,443
- I came unarmed.
- That was your mistake. Sit down.

302
01:14:49,914 --> 01:14:53,134
What do you get in this country
for killing a dirty bastard?

303
01:14:53,955 --> 01:14:58,666
The death penalty for you.
I get a medal, posthumously.

304
01:14:59,116 --> 01:15:05,511
- They always catch a cop killer.
- That's the risk I take.

305
01:15:05,837 --> 01:15:10,126
Your friends death... It was an accident.

306
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:16,137
What have you got there?
A bad tooth? Don't move your jaw!

307
01:15:16,518 --> 01:15:21,547
This might go off by itself. I fire,
and you have no more teeth, no more jaw.

308
01:15:22,999 --> 01:15:29,216
But you'll be alive.
Alive with no jaw.

309
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:37,240
Goodbye vine leaves, goodbye Dolma
soaked in oil. Maybe here.

310
01:15:41,242 --> 01:15:42,743
Or here.

311
01:15:43,682 --> 01:15:48,233
It goes in here,
and comes out in back.

312
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:55,062
Two nice clean holes,
as big as emeralds.

313
01:15:55,644 --> 01:16:03,644
But what a mess in between. No brain.
Just daylight showing through.

314
01:16:05,605 --> 01:16:10,350
Listen, I came here to talk business...

315
01:16:11,286 --> 01:16:14,152
You're not going to hand over
those emeralds for peanuts...

316
01:16:15,686 --> 01:16:20,623
I accept your proposition.
Fifty-fifty and you leave the country.

317
01:16:20,647 --> 01:16:24,459
I've got it, I'll shoot here...

318
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:28,424
You'll be one-eyed, and paralyzed.

319
01:16:29,528 --> 01:16:37,528
Your vision will be fifty-fifty.
One, two, three...

320
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,045
So...

321
01:16:53,892 --> 01:16:55,860
Now we're on even terms.

322
01:16:57,292 --> 01:17:00,376
Maybe I won't get the emeralds,
but all's not lost.

323
01:17:00,413 --> 01:17:03,894
- In the name of the law, I place you under arrest.
- My ass.

324
01:17:07,814 --> 01:17:13,870
Look. If we don't come to
a friendly agreement,

325
01:17:13,894 --> 01:17:16,318
Mr. Tasco will get his emeralds back.

326
01:17:16,495 --> 01:17:20,306
- He'll just be slightly richer.
- He won't forget you.

327
01:17:20,615 --> 01:17:24,872
- Ten percent.
- And the other ninety percent in glory.

328
01:17:24,896 --> 01:17:28,152
Ah, the glory.

329
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:30,895
But with people like you around,
accidents can happen.

330
01:17:31,937 --> 01:17:38,286
And if I'm lucky enough to stay
alive, what happens? "A" I catch you,

331
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:42,753
"B" you get away,
and I look like a fool.

332
01:17:43,018 --> 01:17:47,319
Sorry to say, you're still
in the second category.

333
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:56,610
I forgot to tell you,
I didn't come alone.

334
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:41,626
Sorry, but the game will be short,
because there's only one racquet,

335
01:18:45,547 --> 01:18:47,981
Yes, but I've got the bullets.

336
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:11,758
You know something?
I think it's better this way.

337
01:19:11,911 --> 01:19:14,083
Someone might have gotten hurt.

338
01:19:15,071 --> 01:19:17,256
Disarmed, you know
he can be charming.

339
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:58,844
So long.

340
01:20:00,358 --> 01:20:02,041
Ralph.

341
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:09,575
If I get knocked off,
you get the emeralds.

342
01:20:09,599 --> 01:20:12,575
- You know the mail desk in the Hilton lobby?
- Yes, I know it.

343
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:15,816
You'll find a map showing Where
they are, in an envelope addressed to you.

344
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,936
Remember, only in case of emergency.

345
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:22,511
I'll remember, but nothing's going to
happen to you. See you Thursday.

346
01:20:54,045 --> 01:20:56,058
- Hello.
- Hello.

347
01:20:56,245 --> 01:20:58,953
Oh, that's for me - I'll take it here.

348
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:05,308
Hello, Azad speaking.
Hello, Helene, it's me.

349
01:21:05,807 --> 01:21:08,983
How are you? Getting bored without me?

350
01:21:09,007 --> 01:21:11,944
Everything's fine.
We leave the day after tomorrow.

351
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:14,344
Give me the name of your hotel,
I'll come and get you.

352
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:17,024
Met any interesting people?

353
01:21:17,048 --> 01:21:18,664
If you think I've got
time for socializing...

354
01:21:18,688 --> 01:21:23,194
- I heard something about a blonde.
- Who from?

355
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:27,061
A blonde with big boobs,
and a big hat and bad taste.

356
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:30,346
I warn you, she can't read... she's only
pretending to because it looks intellectual.

357
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:34,717
What is this? Hello, hello?

358
01:21:47,412 --> 01:21:50,063
What the hell are you doing here?

359
01:21:53,813 --> 01:21:57,056
So I leave you alone for just two
days and you turn into a sex maniac?

360
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:02,920
Perfect. What is she, a pro?

361
01:22:03,415 --> 01:22:08,591
- Well, I thought so in the beginning, but...
- Oh, I see, you're past the beginning. Bravo.

362
01:22:08,615 --> 01:22:11,872
Helene, you're a pain.
I told you to stay out with the peasants.

363
01:22:11,896 --> 01:22:13,112
I won't be a pain much longer...

364
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:14,152
Out with the peasants...

365
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:16,513
I meta boy who's everything you're not...

366
01:22:16,537 --> 01:22:19,793
He's very handsome, very polite,
very affectionate. You know what I mean?

367
01:22:19,817 --> 01:22:22,873
If you keep this up,
people are going to stare.

368
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:27,244
Because I'm going to give
you the clout of your life.

369
01:22:27,658 --> 01:22:29,694
Don't tell me you're jealous.

370
01:22:30,218 --> 01:22:35,235
Oh dear, I have to choose.
On the one hand affection and security...

371
01:22:35,259 --> 01:22:40,630
On the other, adventure.
Anyway, I told him I wasn't free.

372
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,825
That was right wasn't it,
to tell him I wasn't free?

373
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,891
You came here just to
give me this grief?

374
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:54,061
- Wasn't I right to tell him I wasn't free?
- No, you were wrong.

375
01:24:52,038 --> 01:24:55,361
Do you have a piece of identification sir?

376
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:25,325
Follow the bus!

377
01:26:36,533 --> 01:26:37,727
Faster!

378
01:28:04,865 --> 01:28:06,801
"And here, finally, is Hadrian's Arch...

379
01:28:06,825 --> 01:28:11,217
built in the second
century A.D. of marble..."

380
01:30:30,445 --> 01:30:35,816
Mr. Azad! I know you're here!

381
01:30:37,606 --> 01:30:41,383
I'm going to count to ten...

382
01:30:41,407 --> 01:30:44,933
If you don't surrender,
we shoot at anything that moves!

383
01:30:46,327 --> 01:30:52,104
One, two, three...

384
01:30:52,128 --> 01:30:59,625
four, five, six, seven...

385
01:30:59,649 --> 01:31:05,839
eight, nine, ten.

386
01:32:43,504 --> 01:32:50,649
Hello? Yes, it's me. No, not yet.

387
01:32:52,145 --> 01:32:57,709
Alright, I'll call you. Bye.

388
01:33:15,108 --> 01:33:16,950
The same for me!

389
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:29,319
- Been here long?
- I just got here.

390
01:33:37,991 --> 01:33:45,991
This is the life. Good whiskey,
a cozy room, nice pictures,

391
01:33:56,154 --> 01:33:57,826
Can I try?

392
01:33:57,874 --> 01:34:00,809
Sure, one clap for off,
two claps for on.

393
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:09,414
- Is that the only game you know?
- No, I know another game.

394
01:34:11,276 --> 01:34:14,893
- A very sexy game.
- I like...

395
01:34:23,077 --> 01:34:25,421
Close your eyes.

396
01:34:25,638 --> 01:34:27,788
Now, stop me whenever you like.

397
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,012
Wow...

398
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,497
The rules say that you
cannot argue with the decision of fate.

399
01:34:47,521 --> 01:34:51,662
If I'm in the hands of fate...

400
01:34:58,122 --> 01:35:00,307
Give me a second.

401
01:36:13,293 --> 01:36:15,869
I just know you're one helluva man...

402
01:36:15,893 --> 01:36:19,216
And I just know you're one
helluva bitch!

403
01:36:22,934 --> 01:36:26,177
Which do you prefer?
The cop or the robber?

404
01:36:26,415 --> 01:36:29,771
You haven't given me a
chance to compare them yet.

405
01:36:33,736 --> 01:36:35,567
Stop it!

406
01:36:47,858 --> 01:36:49,951
Is that why you dragged me to your show?

407
01:36:52,538 --> 01:36:58,075
I did it for Zacharia. He looks the
other way where the show is concerned.

408
01:36:58,099 --> 01:37:03,470
- He picked you to keep an eye on me.
- Yes, but he didn't say why.

409
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:10,917
The first time I saw you,
I should have known.

410
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:16,585
I've been had like a tourist.
All I need is a camera around my neck.

411
01:37:17,302 --> 01:37:18,985
What a mess.

412
01:37:19,462 --> 01:37:22,878
When the customs people see
these faces it'll ruin my reputation.

413
01:37:22,902 --> 01:37:25,690
They'll think I came
straight out a nuthouse.

414
01:37:27,343 --> 01:37:34,420
- What about all those cops at the Hilton?
- That was me too.

415
01:37:34,864 --> 01:37:39,361
- Nice going. You're proud of yourself?
- No.

416
01:37:39,385 --> 01:37:44,321
- OK, get dressed, you're coming with me.
- You don't trust me?

417
01:37:44,345 --> 01:37:46,602
- Oh no.
- Oh no? Too bad.

418
01:37:46,626 --> 01:37:49,762
Just when I was getting to like
the robbers better than the cops.

419
01:37:49,786 --> 01:37:53,086
One more reason why you're
coming with me. Let's go!

420
01:38:05,548 --> 01:38:07,505
I must say, it's bigger than I thought.

421
01:38:09,189 --> 01:38:14,886
Oh well, there are only 54 hotels,
75 boarding houses and 120 rooms to rent.

422
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:18,232
You're not going to have the
slightest trouble finding her.

423
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:21,010
I don't even know what name she's using.

424
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:27,767
Oh well, we can always settle down
wait for the warm weather...

425
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:33,696
the beaches will be jammed
with people and we'll find your.

426
01:38:43,154 --> 01:38:46,760
Well to hell with her. If she's
going to be this stubborn she...

427
01:38:55,875 --> 01:38:59,132
Tell me, what is this girl to you, anyway?

428
01:38:59,156 --> 01:39:03,092
Nothing. She counts on me, that's all.

429
01:39:04,757 --> 01:39:07,180
Her parents were killed
when she was little.

430
01:39:07,397 --> 01:39:09,413
In a car accident. Her father
was an electronics expert.

431
01:39:09,437 --> 01:39:14,375
Since then I've taken care of her.
I'm more her dad than her husband.

432
01:39:14,478 --> 01:39:17,333
Especially now with all these
peer pressures.

433
01:39:17,918 --> 01:39:19,955
Helene's a good girl...

434
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:22,724
and I don't want to let her down.

435
01:39:22,959 --> 01:39:25,776
But I guess that's something
you wouldn't understand.

436
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:33,457
With the triple leap of death,
the King of Magic, Professor Marcie...

437
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:38,857
Get your tickets now, and bring
the whole family to enjoy the show...

438
01:39:38,881 --> 01:39:42,098
at the Cornelius Circus...

439
01:39:42,122 --> 01:39:45,898
tonight, only at the Cornelius Circus...

440
01:39:45,922 --> 01:39:52,539
A big show in a little tent.
Wild lions from Africa, the wild monkeys.

441
01:39:52,563 --> 01:39:57,700
The last boat leaves at noon. Helene,
I'll be waiting for you on the dock.

442
01:39:57,724 --> 01:40:05,724
Spine tingling thrills with the triple
leap of death. Suspense with the King.

443
01:40:07,045 --> 01:40:09,182
At noon on the dock.

444
01:40:09,206 --> 01:40:13,552
The last boat leaves at noon,
do you hear me Helene?

445
01:41:04,293 --> 01:41:08,890
Tonight only at the Cornelius Circus...

446
01:41:09,094 --> 01:41:11,676
A big show in a little tent.

447
01:41:12,134 --> 01:41:16,196
Bring the whole family to see the show
tonight at the Cornelius Circus.

448
01:41:16,815 --> 01:41:19,895
Boy, you better change your schpiel,
you're making a big fool out of yourself.

449
01:41:19,975 --> 01:41:21,592
What do you want me to say to her?

450
01:41:21,616 --> 01:41:24,835
Just tell her you love her, and stop
giving me this crap about a debt of honor.

451
01:41:25,056 --> 01:41:31,803
You don't know her,
she'd think it was true.

452
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,452
Is that him?

453
01:41:48,179 --> 01:41:53,185
- You want to go back to him?
- No, I'm staying.

454
01:42:15,303 --> 01:42:17,214
Get your stuff and let's go.

455
01:42:19,944 --> 01:42:24,320
Helene is not coming,
so leave her alone and beat it.

456
01:42:24,344 --> 01:42:25,538
Got it?

457
01:42:26,465 --> 01:42:29,661
- How do you say "young punk" in this country?
- What?

458
01:42:32,265 --> 01:42:35,565
Let's go! Let's go!

459
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:21,577
You can go back to your cop.

460
01:44:21,601 --> 01:44:24,513
But tell him not to count on me
to make him a millionaire.

461
01:44:24,601 --> 01:44:28,310
What am I going to do with a cop
who's not even a millionaire?

462
01:44:50,245 --> 01:44:52,008
Are you mad at me?

463
01:44:53,605 --> 01:44:56,119
I know it's my fault.

464
01:44:58,246 --> 01:45:01,158
Listen Azad, let me explain.

465
01:45:03,446 --> 01:45:08,862
I grew up. You never noticed it,
but I grew up.

466
01:45:09,167 --> 01:45:12,558
You went on being very nice to me
like when I was little...

467
01:45:12,968 --> 01:45:15,630
but what I wanted was...

468
01:45:17,768 --> 01:45:21,385
But what do you expect?
I couldn't ask you to marry me, could I?

469
01:45:21,409 --> 01:45:24,992
You should have. It would
have kept you out of trouble.

470
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:36,740
- You know you never looked so handsome?
- And that's what you call growing up?

471
01:45:37,851 --> 01:45:39,864
Come on, let's go.

472
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:50,148
Zaoharia's here. There was no
way to warn you. It's my fault.

473
01:46:53,662 --> 01:46:57,078
- You got nabbed at the Hilton?
- Yeah, like a sucker.

474
01:46:57,102 --> 01:47:00,439
- I wanted to know where the emeralds were.
- Now you know.

475
01:47:00,463 --> 01:47:03,375
I didn't even have time
to pick up your map.

476
01:47:06,064 --> 01:47:07,417
Forget it.

477
01:47:08,984 --> 01:47:12,360
- So, what's he want?
- The emeralds.

478
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:14,000
One track mind.

479
01:47:14,225 --> 01:47:18,961
Say, that's a compliment.
General mobilization.

480
01:47:18,985 --> 01:47:21,242
He'll let us get on the boat.
We're free to go.

481
01:47:21,266 --> 01:47:26,306
And what's to guarantee that if we give
him the emeralds, the oops won't grab us?

482
01:47:28,227 --> 01:47:30,160
I'll go ask him.

483
01:48:02,271 --> 01:48:06,561
He says you're right,
none of the cops but him knows us...

484
01:48:06,752 --> 01:48:12,209
So either he sits tight,
and we get on the boat, or he nods.

485
01:48:12,233 --> 01:48:17,409
- And so?
- So he thinks it's funny. Listen Azad, he's a sadist, he'll do anything.

486
01:48:17,433 --> 01:48:20,016
He wants to pin Renzi's death on me.

487
01:48:22,674 --> 01:48:26,691
- I'll give up my share.
- Me too.

488
01:48:32,556 --> 01:48:35,491
Go tell him it's a deal.

489
01:48:50,598 --> 01:48:52,099
It's a deal.

490
01:48:52,598 --> 01:48:56,637
- You can go aboard Miss.
- No thank you, I'll wait for him.

491
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,197
Go aboard, I'll join you.

492
01:50:48,854 --> 01:50:50,288
We share?

493
01:50:52,895 --> 01:50:56,387
No, Mr. Azad. We don't share.

494
01:51:12,538 --> 01:51:17,908
Aren't you coming down?
A touch of vertigo perhaps?

495
01:51:21,659 --> 01:51:28,588
If I shoot... no more brain.
Just holes, Mr. Azad. Nothing but holes.

496
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:32,779
And mine is real. And it's loaded.

497
01:52:05,305 --> 01:52:11,461
- Fifty-fifty?
- Oh no. The whole lot.

498
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:55,214
- Fifty-fifty?
- No!

499
01:57:56,354 --> 01:57:59,425
Inspector Zacharia!

500
01:58:15,477 --> 01:58:17,775
- Azad!
- Yeah!

501
01:58:29,238 --> 01:58:31,821
- Are you ok?
- Ok, ok.

502
01:58:31,959 --> 01:58:34,135
- So what?
- What, what?

503
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:35,967
The emeralds?

504
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,983
Well, I've tried the Poule au Pot.
(Chicken caserole)

505
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:46,727
The chicken with rice
The aspic of chicken (jelly).

506
01:58:47,641 --> 01:58:49,995
The chicken with herbs.

507
01:58:50,681 --> 01:58:53,878
And now we'll have to have to
add chicken cooked with emeralds!
