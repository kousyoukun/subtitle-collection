00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,341
it is an incompetent,
bumbling, sloppy,

365
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,909
fast food employee.

366
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:48,131
Yum.

367
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,132
Yeah.

368
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,655
Ed!

369
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,397
What are you doing inside
the milk shake machine?

370
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,096
Oh, trying to fix it.

371
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,141
Did you turn on the switch?

372
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,839
No.

373
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,189
[ whirring]

374
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,191
Ah.

375
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:06,193
Whoo!

376
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,237
Whoa...

377
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,848
Yeah...

378
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,198
Strawberry Jacuzzi.

379
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,896
Oh! Oy-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi...

380
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,464
Oh-ho, oy-yoi!

381
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,161
People, I'm fully stoked

382
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:22,035
about being in charge
of every single one of you.

383
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,387
Within two years,
Mondo Burger's going to be

384
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,173
the biggestburger chain
on this planet.

385
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:31,914
Oh, yeah.

386
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,307
First we got to beat out

387
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,179
our big competition across
the street, Good Burger.

388
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,789
[ both laughing]

389
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,272
From now on,

390
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:45,710
your lifeis
Mondo Burger.

391
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:48,365
You can forget
about your friends,

392
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,846
you can forget
about your family,

393
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,765
because Kurt... is now both
your mother and your father.

394
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,203
Kurt must look
awfully strange naked.

395
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,726
[ snickering]

396
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,424
Who said that?

397
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,208
Who talked while Kurt
was talking?

398
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:06,427
It was him.

399
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,907
He uttered something.

400
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,519
Why, I should've known.

401
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,434
Uh, I'm sorry I uttered.

402
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,393
You think you're funny,
don't you, bro?

403
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:17,742
You know what?

404
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,571
At Mondo Burger,
there are no comedians.

405
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:23,661
You mess with Kurt and
you go into the grinder.

406
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,925
Okay, now this grinder
of yours,

407
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,187
is it a real grinder

408
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,189
or is it some kind of
a metaphor?

409
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:30,581
That's it, you're gone!

410
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,801
Adios,TKO, historical.

411
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:33,758
Wait, wait, wait.

412
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,195
I-I won't be funny
no more. See?

413
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:36,370
Security!

414
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:37,632
You ain't got to bring

415
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,242
the man down here.
Wait, one second.

416
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,070
Kurt, come on, please,
I need this job.

417
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,202
Take out the trash.

418
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:43,203
"Trash"?

419
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,552
Oh, now, look'ee here, p...

420
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:45,857
Get this loser
out of my face!

421
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,250
"Loser"?

422
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:48,817
Oh, now, you about to push me
a little too far.

423
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,644
You want a piece

424
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:50,514
of me?

425
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,429
Yeah, extra crispy, please.

426
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,301
Oh, see, you
lucky you brought

427
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:55,476
your friends down here.

428
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,173
Hey, man, is this really
necessary?

429
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:58,653
Kurt, please!
I need this job!

430
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:01,003
[ whimpering]:
Please, I need this job. Please.

431
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,657
Excuse me.

432
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,399
Look, I ordered one Good Burger
with nothingon it.

433
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,227
That's what I gave you.

434
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,968
No, you gave me
a bun.

435
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,143
Just a bun.

436
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:12,058
Look, there's no meat in here.

437
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,016
But you said you
wanted nothing on it.

438
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,497
Yes, well, I expected
a meat patty!

439
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,021
Dude, a meat patty is something.

440
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,283
You said nothing.

441
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,632
Fizz, is a meat patty

442
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:23,460
something,
or nothing?

443
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,027
Uh... something?

444
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,072
I win!

445
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,377
All right, that rips it.

446
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,640
I am reporting your name
to the manager!

447
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,642
The manager already
knows my name.

448
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:34,080
Oh, I'll see you in hell!

449
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:36,517
Okay. See you there.

450
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:41,957
Such a nice guy;
I don't know why

451
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,090
he had to throw the
bread everywhere.

452
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,266
I mean, jeez.

453
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,528
One more Good Shake.

454
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,138
Good, good,
keep them coming.

455
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,401
Um, dude, don't you think
you've had enough?

456
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,489
Hey...

457
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,882
Hey, you look familiar.

458
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,145
Don't I know you from somewhere?

459
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,973
Ever been to Australia?

460
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:58,539
No.

461
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,410
Me neither.

462
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,892
I could've sworn I seen
you someplace before.

463
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,198
Hey, I know.

464
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,677
Maybe I'm someone famous.

465
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,375
You know,
like a baseball player,

466
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:09,898
or a pretty nurse. Huh.

467
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:12,553
What? Man, what in the world
are you talking about?

468
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:13,815
Okay, okay, I give up.

469
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,295
Who am I?

470
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,515
I don't know who you are,
or where I know you from,

471
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,083
or why you think
you're an attractive nurse.

472
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:23,085
But I am sure I don't
want to know you

473
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,173
any longer.

474
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,305
Now please, go away.

475
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:26,654
I've had a very bad day.

476
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:27,698
What's wrong?

477
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,396
Were you bitten by a sheep?

478
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,701
What?!

479
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,747
Did you lose
your trousers?

480
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,965
No!

481
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,142
Look, you're an unusually
bad guesser,

482
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:39,188
so I'm going to go ahead
and tell you why I'm upset.

483
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:42,452
I got to come up with $1,900
to fix some jerk's car,

484
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,454
another $800
to fix my mother's car

485
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,587
and I just got fired.

486
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,372
[ sighs]:
Man.

487
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,854
I can't believe Kurt fired me
from Mondo Burger.

488
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:56,075
I mean, he yelled at me,
then he insulted me.

489
00:17:57,424 --> 00:18:00,470
He made fun of me.

490
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,821
Boy, you must really suck.

491
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,564
See, right about now,
I'd slap you

492
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:08,565
in your head,

493
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,089
but I'm not quite sure

494
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,091
that your brain would understand
the concept of pain.

495
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,135
Hey!

496
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,441
Want to see my belly button?

497
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,617
[ sighs]

498
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,228
Well, it was
very unusual

499
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,056
to meet you... Ed.

500
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,493
I'm going to go now
and try to beg someone

501
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,582
for a summer
job, man. Bye.

502
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:29,369
Wait. You could work
here at Good Burger.

503
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:30,761
Here?

504
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,460
Yeah. Hey, Mr. Baily,
this guy needs a job.

505
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:35,114
Could he have one?

506
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,115
No!

507
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,203
See ya.

508
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:38,247
Wait, wait, wait.

509
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,335
Come on, Mr. Baily.

510
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:40,597
He really needs one.

511
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,121
He can do fries.

512
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,209
Otis does fries.

513
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:44,688
Yeah,
but look at him.

514
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:47,648
How much longer
could he possibly live?

515
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,954
[ inhaling]

516
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,130
Yeah.

517
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,175
Well...

518
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,786
Have you ever worked in
fast food before, uh...

519
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,136
Uh, Dexter. Dexter Reed.

520
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,355
And yes, I have worked
in fast food.

521
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:00,443
Yeah? How long?

522
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:01,618
Nearly two days.

523
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:02,967
[ chuckles]:
Oh, well...

524
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,056
Do you know how to drive
a motor vehicle?

525
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,840
Yes.

526
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,972
I'm an excellent driver.

527
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,800
Any accidents on your record?

528
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,846
Not to your knowledge.

529
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,153
[ sighs]

530
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,023
All right, Dexter.

531
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,851
I'm going to
give you a shot.

532
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,722
You're on deliveries.

533
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,854
And you may have
to pitch in

534
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,116
and do some
counter work.

535
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,204
Okay.

536
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,293
Cool! I'll teach him
everything I know!

537
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,295
Oh... God help me.

538
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,906
I won't let you down.

539
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,038
Hey, Fizz.

540
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,301
This is Dexter.

541
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,216
Fizz works drive-thru.

542
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,217
Well, hi-de-ho, Dex.

543
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,176
Uh, hi-de-ho, Fi.

544
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,481
"Fi"?

545
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:41,484
Wow, nobody's ever abbreviated

00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,366
And Ed?
What?

913
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,020
For every Good
Burger we sell,

914
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:44,065
I'm going to give
you ten cents
for every one!

915
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,153
[ laughs]

916
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,328
Oh, man.

917
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,373
A little help here.

918
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,722
Oh, okay,
be right there.

919
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:50,158
No, no, no, no.
I'll help Deedee.

920
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:51,855
You get in that kitchen
and keep making sauce.

921
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,031
[ laughs]
[ screams]

922
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,032
[ humming]

923
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,560
Well, Ed, how's
that sauce-making

924
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,127
coming along?

925
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,520
Oh, pretty good.

926
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,609
Mr. Baily says
it's going to save Good Burger.

927
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:07,958
That's great.

928
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,091
Now, you do remember
that it was my idea

929
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:13,312
to put the sauce on Good Burgers
in the first place, right?

930
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,662
Yeah, you should get some
of the money I receive.

931
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:18,099
I'm glad to hear you say that.

932
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:19,840
In fact, since
we're going to be

933
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:21,624
in business together,
I thought that maybe

934
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:22,973
we should sign
a little contract.

935
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:26,194
Just to make our
partnership official.

936
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:27,761
Yeah, okay.

937
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:30,764
Hmm.

938
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,113
Mm-hmm.

939
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,462
Mm... hmm.

940
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:34,594
Oh, oh, yeah.

941
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:36,378
Mmm, mmm.

942
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:37,901
Mmm.

943
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,165
I know some of these words.

944
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,731
Ah.

945
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,211
So, what does it all mean,
Dexter?

946
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,344
Well, it's-it's quite simple,
really.

947
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:46,562
Of all the money

948
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,695
that Good Burger makes
off your sauce,

949
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:50,044
you get to keep 20%.

950
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,089
Cool? Okay.

951
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,568
And then I'll
keep the other

952
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:56,137
80%, so it works out cool
for both of us.

953
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:59,140
Okay.

954
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:00,576
There you go.

955
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,491
Cool. All right.

956
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:03,884
DEEDEE:
Ed?

957
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,842
There must be 50
customers out there.

958
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,017
It's unbelievable.

959
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,758
What do you put
in that sauce?

960
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:09,759
Well, you start off

961
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,065
with a little lemon juice

962
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,588
and some ketchup.

963
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:14,547
[ groaning and coughing]

964
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,939
Um, look, Dexter,

965
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:18,638
I like you as a friend and all,
but it might...

966
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:19,943
No. Listen to
me carefully.

967
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,249
Okay.

968
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,816
Do not tell anyone the
recipe to your sauce.

969
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,123
Oh. Well, first you start off
with a little lemon juice...

970
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,124
Stop it!

971
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,168
Stop talking.

972
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,126
Oh.

973
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,518
Never tell anyone

974
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,130
the ingredients
of your sauce.

975
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,305
Why?

976
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,437
You want to save Good
Burger, don't you?

977
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:37,135
Oh, yeah.
Good Burger's my life.

978
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:40,616
Well, then, you got to keep
your sauce recipe a secret.

979
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,835
All right?Okay.

980
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,271
All right.Um, Dexter?

981
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:44,359
Hmm?

982
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:45,795
You're squishing my pancreas.

983
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:48,450
Sorry.

984
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:49,843
Thanks.

985
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,722
Unbelievable.

986
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:02,551
Two days ago,
we had Good Burger crushed.

987
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:03,726
Now look at 'em.

988
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,554
I think
it's the sauce, boss.

989
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,904
Oh.

990
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,168
[ grunts]

991
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,952
Duh. I know that.

992
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:14,737
You think Kurt's stupid?

993
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,870
Mmm... Uh-uh, uh-uh.

994
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,699
[ sighs]

995
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,918
I want Good Burger
out of business.

996
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,007
Go find out
what's in that sauce.

997
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,140
I'll go get some
and have it checked out.

998
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,272
[ grunts]

999
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,016
[ laughing]

1000
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,976
Ed, here's your
take for the day.

1001
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,978
$67.00.

1002
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,240
Yay!

1003
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:40,241
Yay!

1004
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,373
[ laughter]

1005
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,678
Thanks for the
sauce, kid.

1006
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,071
[ gasping]
Mmm!

1007
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:45,203
Love ya!

1008
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,857
[ laughing]

1009
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:50,382
Well, here you go, Ed.

1010
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,601
You get to keep $13.

1011
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:55,343
Whoa. That's almost $14.

1012
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,040
Yeah, well, see you tomorrow.

1013
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:59,042
Uh, hey-hey, Dex,
uh, what you doing?

1014
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:00,870
You want to hang
out or something?

1015
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:02,394
Gee, I don't know.

1016
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:04,526
I got to go clean my room.

1017
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,962
I-I got to...

1018
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,225
Please?

1019
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:10,489
Sure. Let-Let's hang out.

1020
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:11,707
Cool!

1021
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:14,057
Want to see
my secret place?

1022
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,886
That's not what I had in mind.

1023
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,713
Come on!

1024
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:18,714
All-All right...

1025
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:19,933
I get you.

1026
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,199
This is my place.

1027
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,419
This is where I
come and think.

1028
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,421
Well, I think.

1029
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,379
That's funny,

1030
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,729
'cause I never took you
for much of a thinker.

1031
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:35,078
Oh, yeah, sure.

1032
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:37,255
I think about all
kind of things:

1033
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,387
Good Burger...

1034
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:41,389
squirrels...

1035
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,782
cardboard boxes...

1036
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,653
things that
are sticky...

1037
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:47,090
I'll bet
you don't have one real problem.

1038
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:49,702
Um, I got six toes
on my left foot.

1039
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:52,095
What kind of problems
do you have?

1040
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,924
Other than the ones  
youcause? Lots.

1041
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:58,276
Most of them started
when I was a little kid.

1042
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,279
That's when my dad left me
and my mom.

1043
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:04,673
I must have lived in 15 places
since then.

1044
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:07,937
I remember the last time
I saw my Dad.

1045
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:09,330
I was seven years old,

1046
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,681
and for no reason at all,
he bought me this yo-yo.

1047
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,814
It was so cool.

1048
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:17,425
I mean, it wasn't
just an ordinary yo-yo.

1049
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,472
It had lights that lit up
when you yo-yoed it.

1050
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:24,127
Red lights on one side,
and blue lights on the other.

1051
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:27,348
And it made this funky,
whistling noise, too.

1052
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:28,567
Wow.

1053
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,482
That sounds
like quite a yo-yo.

1054
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,961
You-you still got it?

1055
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,789
No.

1056
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,139
After awhile,
it stopped lighting up.

1057
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:39,273
Then it quit making that funky
whistling noise.

1058
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,842
Then I guess
my mom just threw it away.

1059
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,977
You know...

1060
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:50,980
I don't even remember
what my dad looks like.

1061
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:55,158
I don't remember
what my dad looks like, either.

1062
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:58,945
But at least
I get to see him every day.

1063
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:02,949
I give up.

1064
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:05,212
I'm going home.

1065
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,350
Oh, h-hey, Dex.

1066
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,527
Uh, thanks for hanging out
with me.

1067
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,616
It's no problem.

1068
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,922
See you tomorrow, buddy.

1069
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,231
You-You mean it?

1070
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,755
Mean what?

1071
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,235
Well, I'm your buddy.

1072
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:30,542
You-You called me your buddy.

1073
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,761
Yeah, sure.

1074
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:34,023
I guess so.

1075
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,199
See you tomorrow.

1076
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,511
Dexter, you got
a delivery.

1077
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:45,687
You are going
to freak.

1078
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:47,210
Ooh!

1079
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,864
Hey, Monique,
um, check it.

1080
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:50,518
I got a delivery
to make.

1081
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:51,954
You want to ride
with me?

1082
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:54,130
Oh, I want to go,
I want to go.

1083
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,480
Oh, yeah.

1084
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:57,612
You can go, Ed.

1085
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:59,484
Yay!

1086
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,964
Oh, man.

1087
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:05,403
[ tires screeching]

1088
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:07,230
DEXTER:
Ed.

1089
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,581
Ed, man, you got to park
the burger. Slow down.

1090
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:10,886
[ tires screeching]

1091
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,800
