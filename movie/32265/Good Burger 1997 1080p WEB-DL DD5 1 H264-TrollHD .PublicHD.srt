00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,850
How come?

171
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,084
Because the boy showed up

172
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:08,486
to work without his pants.

173
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,322
Oh.

174
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,790
Now, please, make this delivery.

175
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,956
The address is on the back.

176
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,091
Oh.

177
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:16,061
It shall be delivered.

178
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,596
So what's your plan
for the summer?

179
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,064
Ha! Let me tell you, boy,

180
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,934
I plan to wake up every
day at around noon,

181
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,002
then I'm going to
lay out by the pool,

182
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,437
order some Chinese food,

183
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,774
maybe invite some fine
females over to share

184
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,341
an egg roll
or two.

185
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:32,210
Then I'm going to
wake up the next day,

186
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,679
do it all over again.

187
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:34,679
Ha, ha!

188
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,914
Know what I'm saying?

189
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,348
Say, man, you're lucky.

190
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,818
My folks is making me
get a summer job.

191
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,252
See, that's it right there.

192
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:43,822
You got to explain things
to parents.

193
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,157
Like summer vacation.

194
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,094
The key word there
is "va-ca-tion."

195
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,930
See what I'm saying?

196
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,771
♪ She's a dude,
'cause we're all dudes ♪

197
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,908
♪ Hey, I'm a dude,
he's a dude... ♪

198
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,013
♪ She's a dude, whoa,
'cause we're all dudes ♪

199
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:09,915
♪ Hey, I'm a dude... ♪

200
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,783
Look out!

201
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,119
Whoa!

202
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,089
Just get off the...

203
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,801
My afro.

204
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,370
My afro!

205
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:35,639
Why?!

206
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,545
Oh, brother Reed,
you have messed up my afro.

207
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,649
All right, don't worry, bro.

208
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,552
Just be cool
and let me handle this.

209
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,354
All right, Jake?

210
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,855
Jake?

211
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,356
Jake!

212
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:53,757
Oh, no.

213
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,295
Oh, baby.
Oh!

214
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,629
Oh, no.

215
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,265
Oh! Oh, my grill.

216
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,600
Oh, Black Beauty, oh.
Oh!

217
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,936
Oh!

218
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,503
See, when I left
school today

219
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,439
I didn't think I was going
to run into you this summer.

220
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:09,240
Or I didn't think you
was going to run into me.

221
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,675
I mean, just <i>run</i>
into me like this.

222
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,377
You're in trouble
with me, young man.

223
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:13,444
You're in trouble
with me!

224
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,813
No, listen, Mr. Wheat,
listen.

225
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:15,947
It wasn't my fault.

226
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,515
See, this nut
on some roller blades,

227
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,718
he skated into my vision sight,
and I couldn't

228
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,951
see nothing,
so I swerved...

229
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:22,187
Roller blades?
Roller blades?!

230
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:23,188
And we was spinning
around like that...

231
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:24,423
I don't want
to hear it!

232
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,990
...and then
I couldn't control it...

233
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,192
I don't want to hear it.

234
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,927
Know how much
that car cost me?

235
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:29,927
No.

236
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,062
Do you know?

237
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,062
No.

238
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:32,463
That's a $22,000 car.

239
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:33,599
$22,000!

240
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,100
And that's just
the base price!

241
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,302
Check out
the chrome, see?

242
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,735
I waited four weeks
for the chrome!

243
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:39,638
You can't get chrome
wheels at base price!

244
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:40,906
See that leather?

245
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,307
That's Detroit leather.
That's Detroit leather.

246
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:46,010
You got to order Detroit
leather from Detroit!

247
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,344
Huh? What's that tell you?

248
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:51,182
They always get you
with them extras.

249
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,786
Give me your
driver's license.

250
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,021
Um...

251
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,555
Give me your
driver's license.

252
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,490
Um, regarding my
driver's license,

253
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,461
I'd give it to you, but
you're going to have to wait.

254
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,562
For what?

255
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,895
Oh, about a year.

256
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:05,963
Oh, no.

257
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,666
That-that's when
I get one.

258
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,801
No, no...

259
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,302
When they
put it in my hand.

260
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,769
You don't have
a driver's license?

261
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,769
No.

262
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,172
I know you don't have
no insurance, do you?

263
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,339
I guess...

264
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,607
I hate to do this,
young man.

265
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,241
I hate to put a
black man in jail,

266
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,142
but I'm going to have
to call the police.

267
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,478
Black man in jail?

268
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:20,544
You ain't got the...
I'm just a kid.

269
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:21,746
No, no, no,
not the police.

270
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,014
Don't call the police.

271
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,350
No, please, don't call them.
Don't call them.

272
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,617
Please, don't call
the police!

273
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:26,951
They can't find out
I was driving

274
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:28,320
without a license, sir,
please.

275
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,421
No, please,
let me fix it.

276
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:30,723
Just let me,
let me fix it, please.

277
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,122
You shouldn't
have been driving.

278
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:34,493
No, let me fix it.
Let me fix it!

279
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:36,728
All right.

280
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,729
All right?

281
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,297
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.

282
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,066
Yeah, I'll let you
fix the car.

283
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:45,137
So, uh, how much you think
it's going to cost to fix?

284
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:49,841
$1,900?!

285
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,909
I don't have $1,900.

286
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,044
That's all right.

287
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,579
Maybe your parents
will help you out.

288
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,948
I'll just give them a call...

289
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:57,750
Ooh, oh, um, wait.
I'll get the money.

290
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,918
You can't get the money.

291
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,219
I know you got a summer,
you just want to be free.

292
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:02,221
We'll just call...

293
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,755
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

294
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:06,125
I will... I'll...

295
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,259
I'll...

296
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,760
I'll... I'll...

297
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,562
I'll...

298
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:16,302
I'll get a summer job.

299
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:23,841
Bun, patty, topping, sauce, assemble.

300
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:28,580
Bun, patty, topping, sauce,
assemble.

301
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,286
Bun, patty, topping,
sauce, assemble.

302
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:37,956
Come here, little bun.

303
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,557
Oh, beef patty.

304
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,199
Okay, yeah.
Ooh, that's nasty.

305
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,501
All right.

306
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,068
Yo, my man,
can I borrow some lettuce?

307
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,070
Can I borrow some...

308
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,973
You.

309
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,973
Who?

310
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:56,741
You! Look at this mess.

311
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,043
I, I can explain.

312
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,678
See, I was trying to put
the big old beef patty...

313
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,914
oh, on the bottom half
of the bun, you know,

314
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,815
before the tomato
gets all slippery

315
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,351
with the... ooh,
that's slippery.

316
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,919
Oh, I'm sorry.
And then, you know,

317
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,355
the pickle bits was
making me do the wrong...

318
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,124
because they're,
they're flexible,

319
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,192
they're not crunchy.

320
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,360
And...

321
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,861
Yo, man, back me up on this.

322
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:19,463
Oh, again with
the whistle.

323
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,233
Shut up. Just be quiet.

324
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,667
It'd be a lot more quiet

325
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,836
if you stopped
blowing the whistle.

326
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:25,803
Watch your mouth,

327
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:27,405
you pestiferous
little maggot.

328
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:30,274
Now, I'm familiar
with the term "maggot"

329
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,742
but... pestiferous?

330
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:35,514
Burn this into the front row
of your brain, chuckles.

331
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,850
If there's one thing
Kurt cannot stand

332
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,384
it is an incompetent,
bumbling, sloppy,

333
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,922
fast food employee.

334
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,159
Yum.

335
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,160
Yeah.

336
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,661
Ed!

337
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,431
What are you doing inside
the milk shake machine?

338
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:56,134
Oh, trying to fix it.

339
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,169
Did you turn on the switch?

340
00:13:58,169 --> 00:13:59,870
No.

341
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,243
Ah.

342
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,244
Whoo!

343
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:07,278
Whoa...

344
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,846
Yeah...

345
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,249
Strawberry Jacuzzi.

346
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,918
Oh! Oy-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi...

347
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:16,487
Oh-ho, oy-yoi!

348
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,223
People, I'm fully stoked

349
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:22,093
about being in charge
of every single one of you.

350
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:26,431
Within two years,
Mondo Burger's going to be

351
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:30,201
the <i>biggest</i> burger chain
on this planet.

352
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:31,937
Oh, yeah.

353
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,171
First we got to beat out

354
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:36,206
our big competition across
the street, Good Burger.

355
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,314
From now on,

356
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:45,750
your <i>life</i> is
Mondo Burger.

357
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,419
You can forget
about your friends,

358
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,854
you can forget
about your family,

359
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:56,729
because Kurt... is now both
your mother and your father.

360
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:00,230
Kurt must look
awfully strange naked.

361
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,468
Who said that?

362
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,269
Who talked while Kurt
was talking?

363
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:06,471
It was him.

364
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:07,873
He uttered something.

365
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,543
Why, I should've known.

366
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,477
Uh, I'm sorry I uttered.

367
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,413
You think you're funny,
don't you, bro?

368
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,749
You know what?

369
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:20,619
At Mondo Burger,
there are no comedians.

370
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,687
You mess with Kurt and
you go into the grinder.

371
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,956
Okay, now this grinder
of yours,

372
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,225
is it a real grinder

373
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:29,226
or is it some kind of
a metaphor?

374
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:30,629
That's it, you're gone!

375
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,831
<i>Adios,</i> TKO, historical.

376
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,764
Wait, wait, wait.

377
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,232
I-I won't be funny
no more. See?

378
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,400
Security!

379
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,669
You ain't got to bring

380
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,269
the man down here.
Wait, one second.

381
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,105
Kurt, come on, please,
I need this job.

382
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:42,240
Take out the trash.

383
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,241
"Trash"?

384
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,575
Oh, now, look'ee here, p...

385
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,877
Get this loser
out of my face!

386
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,178
"Loser"?

387
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:48,846
Oh, now, you about to push me
a little too far.

388
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:49,682
You want a piece

389
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,515
of me?

390
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:52,483
Yeah, extra crispy, please.

391
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,352
Oh, see, you
lucky you brought

392
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:55,519
your friends down here.

393
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,221
Hey, man, is this really
necessary?

394
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:58,655
Kurt, please!
I need this job!

395
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:01,024
Please, I need this job. Please.

396
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:02,394
Excuse me.

397
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,431
Look, I ordered one Good Burger
with <i>nothing</i> on it.

398
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,264
That's what I gave you.

399
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,966
No, you gave me
a bun.

400
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,201
Just a bun.

401
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,104
Look, there's no meat in here.

402
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,073
But you said you
wanted nothing on it.

403
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,542
Yes, well, I expected
a meat patty!

404
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,076
Dude, a meat patty is something.

405
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,311
You said nothing.

406
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:21,680
Fizz, is a meat patty

407
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,481
something,
or nothing?

408
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,049
Uh... something?

409
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,116
I win!

410
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,418
All right, that rips it.

411
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,687
I am reporting your name
to the manager!

412
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,689
The manager already
knows my name.

413
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,125
Oh, I'll see you in hell!

414
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,495
Okay. See you there.

415
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,966
Such a nice guy;
I don't know why

416
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,134
he had to throw the
bread everywhere.

417
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:46,303
I mean, jeez.

418
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:47,572
One more Good Shake.

419
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,173
Good, good,
keep them coming.

420
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:51,442
Um, dude, don't you think
you've had enough?

421
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:52,509
Hey...

422
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,912
Hey, you look familiar.

423
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,214
Don't I know you from somewhere?

424
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,982
Ever been to Australia?

425
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:58,583
No.

426
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,418
Me neither.

427
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,921
I could've sworn I seen
you someplace before.

428
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,256
Hey, I know.

429
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,692
Maybe I'm someone famous.

430
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,425
You know,
like a baseball player,

431
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,927
or a pretty nurse. Huh.

432
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,597
What? Man, what in the world
are you talking about?

433
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:13,831
Okay, okay, I give up.

434
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,233
Who am I?

435
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:18,569
I don't know who you are,
or where I know you from,

436
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,139
or why you think
you're an attractive nurse.

437
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,141
But I am sure I don't
want to know you

438
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,209
any longer.

439
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,343
Now please, go away.

440
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:26,678
I've had a very bad day.

441
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,746
What's wrong?

442
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,448
Were you bitten by a sheep?

443
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,749
What?!

444
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,784
Did you lose
your trousers?

445
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:33,986
No!

446
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,188
Look, you're an unusually
bad guesser,

447
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,223
so I'm going to go ahead
and tell you why I'm upset.

448
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:42,493
I got to come up with $1,900
to fix some jerk's car,

449
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,494
another $800
to fix my mother's car

450
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:46,597
and I just got fired.

451
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,433
Man.

452
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:52,870
I can't believe Kurt fired me
from Mondo Burger.

453
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,041
I mean, he yelled at me,
then he insulted me.

454
00:17:57,442 --> 00:18:00,511
He made fun of me.

455
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,816
Boy, you must really suck.

456
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:07,586
See, right about now,
I'd slap you

457
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,586
in your head,

458
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:10,087
but I'm not quite sure

459
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:12,123
that your brain would understand
the concept of pain.

460
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,192
Hey!

461
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,492
Want to see my belly button?

462
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:19,297
Well, it was
very unusual

463
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,065
to meet you... Ed.

464
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:23,535
I'm going to go now
and try to beg someone

465
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,571
for a summer
job, man. Bye.

466
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:29,407
Wait. You could work
here at Good Burger.

467
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:30,808
Here?

468
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,511
Yeah. Hey, Mr. Baily,
this guy needs a job.

469
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,145
Could he have one?

470
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:36,146
No!

471
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:37,249
See ya.

472
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,283
Wait, wait, wait.

473
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:39,384
Come on, Mr. Baily.

474
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,652
He really needs one.

475
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,120
He can do fries.

476
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,253
Otis does fries.

477
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,722
Yeah,
but look at him.

478
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:47,692
How much longer
could he possibly live?

479
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,162
Yeah.

480
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,198
Well...

481
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,834
Have you ever worked in
fast food before, uh...

482
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,135
Uh, Dexter. Dexter Reed.

483
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,403
And yes, I have worked
in fast food.

484
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:00,471
Yeah? How long?

485
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:01,673
Nearly two days.

486
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,008
Oh, well...

487
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,076
Do you know how to drive
a motor vehicle?

488
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:05,876
Yes.

489
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,979
I'm an excellent driver.

490
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,814
Any accidents on your record?

491
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,850
Not to your knowledge.

492
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,019
All right, Dexter.

493
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,887
I'm going to
give you a shot.

494
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:18,756
You're on deliveries.

495
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,891
And you may have
to pitch in

496
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:21,125
and do some
counter work.

497
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,160
Okay.

498
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,362
Cool! I'll teach him
everything I know!

499
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,364
Oh... God help me.

500
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:28,933
I won't let you down.

501
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,001
Hey, Fizz.

502
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,336
This is Dexter.

503
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:34,271
Fizz works drive-thru.

504
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,272
Well, hi-de-ho, Dex.

505
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:37,208
Uh, hi-de-ho, Fi.

506
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,442
"Fi"?

507
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:41,512
Wow, nobody's ever abbreviated
my name before.

508
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:43,180
I love that.

509
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,382
Huh!

510
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:46,351
Hey, and that's Otis. Huh.

511
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,686
He's 77 years old

512
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:50,355
and still works
in fast food. Huh.

513
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,958
I should've died years ago.

514
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,825
Tough break.

515
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,894
And there's Deedee.

516
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,996
She's a
veterinarian.

517
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:58,997
Vegetarian.

518
00:19:58,997 --> 00:19:59,931
Oh.

519
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,866
That means she
doesn't eat fur.

520
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,234
I won't wear fur.

521
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,068
I don't eat meat.

522
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:09,808
Hey, uh, Ed,
wh-what is that?

523
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,742
Oh, that's
just Spatch.

524
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,744
Let me show you.
Come here. Huh.

525
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:14,945
Hey, Spatch.

526
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:21,586
Uh, Spatch isn't much of
a "people person." Huh.

527
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,289
Aah!

528
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,265
Mmm.

529
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:35,701
Mmm.

530
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,536
Mmm.

531
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,172
You want to rinse that off?

532
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,442
Uh...

533
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,442
Well, hello.

534
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:46,844
My name is Dexter.

535
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,479
I'm your new coworker.

536
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,847
Monique.

537
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:52,483
Well, that's a nice outfit
you got on there.

538
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:53,750
And those stripes
really bring out

539
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,885
the color of your eyes.

540
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:55,987
Yes.

541
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,721
You can imagine how
embarrassed I was

542
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,057
when I came to work

543
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,392
and saw everyone
wearing the same thing.

544
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,095
Oh, okay.

545
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:06,697
Oh, I-I guess
I'll see you later then.

546
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:08,966
Guess you will.

547
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,840
Yo, man, who was that?

548
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,174
She is all that.

549
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:18,576
All what?

550
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:19,844
N-Never mind.

551
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:21,112
So, tell me,
what am I going

552
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,713
to be making my
deliveries in?

553
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:24,414
A van, a truck?

554
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:29,252
♪ Feel my desire. ♪

555
00:21:29,252 --> 00:21:32,856
There she is--
the Burger Mobile. Huh.

556
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,858
Think you can handle her?

557
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:35,992
I don't know.

558
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:37,729
I never driven
a sandwich before.

559
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,263
Ha. Huh.

560
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:42,567
Come on, I'll take
you for a spin.

561
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,567
A'ight.

562
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:44,702
Huh.

563
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:47,906
Now, uh,
you can drive, right?

564
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:51,742
I mean, you can read
all the signs and stuff?

565
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:59,150
Yeah! Now this is what
I call fast food! Huh!

566
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,951
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, look out for..!

567
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,221
That was a stop sign!

568
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,990
Uh... no.

569
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,226
Oh, man.

570
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,276
Watch out for the...!

571
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,877
Whoa!

572
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:32,449
Hey! Hey!

573
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,251
Get back here!

574
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:41,927
Closing time at last.

575
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:44,461
All right, let me see.

576
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:48,598
$5 an hour, six hours a day,
five days a week.

577
00:22:48,598 --> 00:22:52,869
I should be able to pay off
the car in, uh...

578
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:55,806
Oh, another lifetime!

579
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,879
Man! This place

580
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:02,079
is the most nauseating,

581
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,749
pathetic hole I
have ever seen.

582
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,717
I mean, what kind
of diseased maggot

583
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,318
would even consider eating here?

584
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:10,221
Welcome to Good Burger,
home of the Good Burger.

585
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:11,856
Can I take your order? Huh.

586
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:13,692
Check it, boys.

587
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,359
Right back there.

588
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,760
It's the reject.

589
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,830
Hey, check it, Ed.

590
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:21,965
It's the Mondo idiot!

591
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:23,967
Oh, well, nice to meet you,
Mondo Idiot.

592
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,370
I'm Ed. Huh.

593
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:28,839
Well, Ed, you better watch
your butt, man.

594
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,109
Okay.

595
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,817
Look, you got a purpose
for being here?

596
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,085
Yeah, I do.

597
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,686
I just thought you
Good Burger losers

598
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:43,119
should be aware

599
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,357
that tonight is the grand
opening of Mondo Burger.

600
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:48,526
The second we open

601
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:52,563
our doors, Good Burger
goes in the grinder.

602
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:53,865
Again with this grinder.

603
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,901
Look, man,
you either order something,

604
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,535
or you can get out of here.

605
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:59,737
Yeah. Sure.

606
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,540
You can take
my order.

607
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:07,178
I'll have the very last
Good Burger to go.

608
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:14,485
Oh, I give up.

609
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:19,857
There is no way a guy can
watch his own butt. Oh!

610
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:42,012
Yeah!

611
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:44,481
Is everybody liking my party?!

612
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,255
And now...

613
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:54,625
I'm psyched to present
to you people,

614
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,694
Mondo Burger!

615
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:09,240
And now, people,
welcome to Mondo Burger.

616
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:37,835
Um, Mr. Baily.

617
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:41,740
Since we don't have any
customers, or electricity...

618
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,141
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:47,245
I suppose we should all just,
uh, go on home.

620
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:56,787
Looks like Good Burger closed early tonight.

621
00:25:56,787 --> 00:26:00,892
Yep. And it think pretty soon,
they'll be closed for good.

Got one, what?

639
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:45,937
What? What?

640
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,171
A Mondo Burger.

641
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:50,207
All right,
all right, everybody.

642
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,909
Now, don't get
all excitable.

643
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:56,746
Holy Mackerel.

644
00:26:57,914 --> 00:26:59,916
It's huge.

645
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,989
Look at that.

646
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,036
And I don't know how they do it,
but they charge the same amount

647
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,605
as we do
for a Good Burger.

648
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,538
Whoa.

649
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,175
How do they do it?

650
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:27,744
They just
use more meat.

651
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:29,813
Oh, poor cows.

652
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,015
Hey, Spatch.

653
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:33,717
Hand me a Good Burger.

654
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:38,623
Huh.

655
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,557
They sound similar.

656
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:44,895
Come on,
what was our take today?

657
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:47,499
$43.09.

658
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,033
That's it?!

659
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,433
Oh...

660
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:53,171
I suppose I can always feed
my mother cat food.

661
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,039
Now probably wouldn't
be the best time

662
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,407
to ask for a raise?

663
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:58,375
No!

664
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,313
I'm going home.

665
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,980
Good night, people.

666
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,650
Good night,
Mr. Baily.

667
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,252
So, Monique, what are you
going to do tonight

668
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,854
after you lock up?

669
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,190
I thought I'd go home.

670
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,025
Home? Why?

671
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,495
Well, that's where my stuff is.

672
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:22,031
Stuff. Ha, ha, ha.

673
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:23,933
Hey, Dex.

674
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:25,103
Want to hang out tonight?

675
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,336
I don't know, but--

676
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:28,573
Hey Ed, you better be careful.

677
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:38,682
You!

678
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:40,116
Me?

679
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,786
Now I know
where I saw you before.

680
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,989
You're the roller-blading nut
that caused my accident.

681
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,624
Uh... no?

682
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,726
You're the reason
why I owe 1,900 bucks.

683
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,862
You're the reason
my mom found out

684
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,497
I was driving without a license.

685
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,164
Man, you cost me a fortune.

686
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:55,899
You wrecked my
summer, man.

687
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,302
You ruined my life.

688
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:00,137
So, you don't want
to hang out tonight?

689
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,439
No. I don't want to
hang out with you...

690
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,441
ever.

691
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:09,779
Do you think
you can get me to a hospital?

692
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,648
I think I broke my ass.

693
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:12,782
Come on, Otis.

694
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:14,752
Get out of the way.

695
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,761
Oh, man.

696
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:25,896
Ah, Mr. Reed.

697
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:27,897
Hard at work as usual.

698
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:29,465
I'm having my lunch.

699
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:31,501
Well, I just got my car back
from the body shop,

700
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,002
and I got to admit,
good as new.

701
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:34,338
Here's the receipt.

702
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:39,809
$2,500?

703
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:40,877
No!

704
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:43,114
The estimate was only
for $1,900.

705
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,351
Well, that my young brother,
is why they call it an estimate.

706
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,619
Close to, kind of, could be.

707
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:48,952
And I estimate
it'll take you

708
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:50,954
about two and half months
to get me my money.

709
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:52,456
Now, you have a good day
at work.

710
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,458
I'm going to have lunch
at Mondo Burger.

711
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,726
Home of the Big Booty Burger.

712
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:57,896
Home of the Big
Booty Burger.

713
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:01,899
Oh, man.

714
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:04,367
Mind if I sit here?

715
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,602
Yes, I do mind.

716
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:06,570
Uh, thanks.

717
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:08,772
What-what-what
are you doing?

718
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:09,773
Eating my lunch.

719
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:12,375
I told you not
to sit here.

720
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,711
I don't like you.

721
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,246
Can't you get that
through your head?

722
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,382
I can try.

723
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,517
Hmm.

724
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:24,421
Nope.

725
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:25,689
All right,
I see, I'm going

726
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:27,091
to have to spell
this out for you.

727
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,391
I don't want to sit by you.

728
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:29,559
I don't want to see you.

729
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,861
I don't want to smell you.

730
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,663
I don't want
to hang out with you.

731
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:35,333
I don't even want to use words
with the letter "U."

732
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,402
Look, I'm Grape Nose Boy.

that lunch with you

Ah. Huh.

Oh, that's my sauce.

Huh.

754
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:14,871
You carry your
own sauce?

00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,975
Doesn't everybody?

756
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,178
Hey, hey, would
you watch it?

757
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,446
Sorry.

758
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,250
Hey, that is
kind of good.

759
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,618
You sure you made
this by yourself?

760
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:31,054
Yeah. It's my very own recipe.

761
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,891
Nobody knows about this, right?

762
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:34,892
Nope.

763
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,727
Hey, Fizz,

764
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,964
come here.

765
00:31:39,963 --> 00:31:41,197
Hi, you guys.

766
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:42,332
What can I...?

767
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:44,668
Hey, what did you do?

768
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:45,869
Mmm.

769
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:46,703
This is really good.

770
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:48,371
What did you guys put on this?

771
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:52,042
Deedee, Otis,
Monique, come here.

772
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,578
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey!

773
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,282
Mom, I got to call you back.

774
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:02,285
This is
so good.

775
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,587
Hey, hey, hey.

776
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:05,690
What in the name of
ground beef is going on?

777
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,091
Mr. Baily,
try this.

778
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,092
Dexter, I don't have time...

779
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,028
It's good.

780
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,028
Terrific.

781
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:12,229
Mm-hmm.

782
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,497
This is marvelous.
What is it?

783
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:14,798
A French fry.

784
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:15,766
I know that, Ed.

785
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:17,334
I'm talking about the sauce.

786
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:18,368
What's in the sauce?

787
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:19,470
Ed's ingredients.

788
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,871
He made it himself.

789
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:21,839
Ed?

790
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:21,839
Excellent.

791
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:23,206
It's awesome.

792
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,608
It makes me glad
I'm not dead.

793
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:25,775
Ed!

794
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,012
If we put that sauce
on all the Good Burgers,

795
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:29,613
then everyone will
want to eat here.

796
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:31,982
We'll knock Mondo Burger
right off the map.

797
00:32:31,982 --> 00:32:33,182
Whee! That's great.

798
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:34,117
Yeah!

799
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:35,519
It's true.

800
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,954
Ed, get in that kitchen
and start making sauce.

801
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:39,656
Yippee skippy!

802
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,358
It shall be done.

803
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,528
Don't let us down.

829
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,248
Move over.

830
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,416
And Ed?

831
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,416
What?

832
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,019
For every Good
Burger we sell,

833
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,087
I'm going to give you ten cents for every one!

834
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:46,356
Oh, man.

835
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:47,423
A little help here.

836
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:48,759
Oh, okay,
be right there.

837
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,227
No, no, no, no.
I'll help Deedee.

838
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,862
You get in that kitchen
and keep making sauce.

839
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,604
Well, Ed, how's
that sauce-making

840
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:02,140
coming along?

841
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,575
Oh, pretty good.

842
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,644
Mr. Baily says
it's going to save Good Burger.

843
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:07,978
That's great.

844
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:10,114
Now, you do remember
that it was my idea

845
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,349
to put the sauce on Good Burgers
in the first place, right?

846
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:15,685
Yeah, you should get some
of the money I receive.

847
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,155
I'm glad to hear you say that.

848
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:19,856
In fact, since
we're going to be

849
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:21,659
in business together,
I thought that maybe

850
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,992
we should sign
a little contract.

851
00:34:22,992 --> 00:34:26,230
Just to make our
partnership official.

852
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,764
Yeah, okay.

853
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,800
Hmm.

854
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,135
Mm-hmm.

855
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:33,503
Mm... hmm.

856
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:34,637
Oh, oh, yeah.

857
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:36,440
Mmm, mmm.

858
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,909
Mmm.

859
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,210
I know some of these words.

860
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,744
Ah.

861
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:43,246
So, what does it all mean,
Dexter?

862
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:45,382
Well, it's-it's quite simple,
really.

863
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:46,616
Of all the money

864
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,719
that Good Burger makes
off your sauce,

865
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,054
you get to keep 20 %.

866
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,122
Cool? Okay.

867
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,623
And then I'll
keep the other

868
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:56,193
80 %, so it works out cool
for both of us.

869
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:59,195
Okay.

870
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:00,597
There you go.

871
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:02,532
Cool. All right.

872
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:03,900
Ed?

873
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,869
There must be 50
customers out there.

874
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:07,036
It's unbelievable.

875
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:08,805
What do you put
in that sauce?

876
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,807
Well, you start off

877
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,074
with a little lemon juice

878
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:12,609
and some ketchup.

879
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:15,945
Um, look, Dexter,

880
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:18,681
I like you as a friend and all,
but it might...

881
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:19,949
No. Listen to
me carefully.

882
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:21,150
Okay.

883
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,853
Do not tell anyone the
recipe to your sauce.

884
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:25,155
Oh. Well, first you start off
with a little lemon juice...

885
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,156
Stop it!

886
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,224
Stop talking.

887
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:28,159
Oh.

888
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,559
Never tell anyone

889
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,162
the ingredients
of your sauce.

890
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:33,364
Why?

891
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,499
You want to save Good
Burger, don't you?

892
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:37,166
Oh, yeah.
Good Burger's my life.

893
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:40,670
Well, then, you got to keep
your sauce recipe a secret.

894
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,871
All right?

895
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,871
Okay.

896
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,306
All right.

897
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,306
Um, Dexter?

898
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:44,407
Hmm?

899
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:45,775
You're squishing my pancreas.

900
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,512
Sorry.

901
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:49,847
Thanks.

902
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,757
Unbelievable.

903
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,592
Two days ago,
we had Good Burger crushed.

904
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:03,759
Now look at 'em.

905
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,596
I think
it's the sauce, boss.

906
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,898
Oh.

907
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,969
Duh. I know that.

908
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,771
You think Kurt's stupid?

909
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:16,874
Mmm... Uh-uh, uh-uh.

910
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,945
I want Good Burger
out of business.

911
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:24,047
Go find out
what's in that sauce.

912
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:26,149
I'll go get some
and have it checked out.

913
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,992
Ed, here's your
take for the day.

914
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:37,994
$67.00.

915
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:39,296
Yay!

916
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:40,297
Yay!

917
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:42,732
Thanks for the
sauce, kid.

918
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,101
Mmm!

919
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,235
Love ya!

920
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,440
Well, here you go, Ed.

921
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,643
You get to keep $13.

922
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,378
Whoa. That's almost $14.

923
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:57,047
Yeah, well, see you tomorrow.

924
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,048
Uh, hey-hey, Dex,
uh, what you doing?

925
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:00,918
You want to hang
out or something?

926
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,452
Gee, I don't know.

927
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:04,588
I got to go clean my room.

928
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:05,989
I-I got to...

929
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,191
Please?

930
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:10,527
Sure. Let-Let's hang out.

931
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:11,728
Cool!

932
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:14,063
Want to see
my secret place?

933
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:16,933
That's not what I had in mind.

934
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:17,735
Come on!

935
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,735
All-All right...

936
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:19,937
I get you.

937
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,209
This is my place.

938
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,477
This is where I
come and think.

939
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,480
Well, I think.

940
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,414
That's funny,

941
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:33,750
'cause I never took you
for much of a thinker.

942
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,085
Oh, yeah, sure.

943
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:37,287
I think about all
kind of things:

944
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,422
Good Burger...

945
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,424
squirrels...

946
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,827
cardboard boxes...

947
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,695
things that
are sticky...

948
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,097
I'll bet
you don't have one real problem.

949
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,733
Um, I got six toes
on my left foot.

950
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,103
What kind of problems
do you have?

951
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,938
Other than the ones<i>
you</i> cause? Lots.

952
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:58,307
Most of them started
when I was a little kid.

953
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:01,277
That's when my dad left me
and my mom.

954
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:04,713
I must have lived in 15 places
since then.

955
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:07,951
I remember the last time
I saw my Dad.

956
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:09,351
I was seven years old,

957
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:12,722
and for no reason at all,
he bought me this yo-yo.

958
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:14,858
It was so cool.

959
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:17,460
I mean, it wasn't
just an ordinary yo-yo.

960
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,530
It had lights that lit up
when you yo-yoed it.

961
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,168
Red lights on one side,
and blue lights on the other.

962
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,403
And it made this funky,
whistling noise, too.

963
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:28,606
Wow.

964
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,540
That sounds
like quite a yo-yo.

965
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:32,009
You-you still got it?

966
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,809
No.

967
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,146
After awhile,
it stopped lighting up.

968
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,282
Then it quit making that funky
whistling noise.

969
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:42,853
Then I guess
my mom just threw it away.

970
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:47,990
You know...

971
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:51,027
I don't even remember
what my dad looks like.

972
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:55,197
I don't remember
what my dad looks like, either.

973
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:58,935
But at least
I get to see him every day.

974
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:02,972
I give up.

975
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:05,175
I'm going home.

976
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,382
Oh, h-hey, Dex.

977
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:15,586
Uh, thanks for hanging out
with me.

978
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:17,653
It's no problem.

979
00:39:17,653 --> 00:39:19,923
See you tomorrow, buddy.

980
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:24,260
You-You mean it?

981
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,797
Mean what?

982
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,264
Well, I'm your buddy.

983
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:30,600
You-You called me your buddy.

984
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,803
Yeah, sure.

985
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:34,038
I guess so.

986
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,173
See you tomorrow.

987
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:43,547
Dexter, you got
a delivery.

988
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,715
You are going
to freak.

989
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:47,250
Ooh!

990
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,919
Hey, Monique,
um, check it.

991
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:50,554
I got a delivery
to make.

992
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,989
You want to ride
with me?

993
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,157
Oh, I want to go,
I want to go.

994
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:55,525
Oh, yeah.

995
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:57,661
You can go, Ed.

996
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,528
Yay!

997
00:39:59,528 --> 00:40:01,998
Oh, man.

998
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:07,237
Ed.

999
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:09,639
Ed, man, you got to park
the burger. Slow down.

1000
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,677
Watch it, Steve!

1001
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,778
Hey, hey!

1002
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,985
Oh, hey, man.

1003
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:27,523
Whoa!

1004
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:29,726
Come on, man,
the locker room's this way.

1005
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:33,530
So, after scoring that amazing, last-minute,
game-winning shot,

1006
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,165
and bringing your team
all the way

1007
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:37,333
to the NBA Championship,
how do you feel?

1008
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,868
I feel hungry.

1009
00:40:41,737 --> 00:40:43,839
Delivery.

1010
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,975
Shaq...!

1011
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:12,735
Oh, oh, oh!

1012
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,539
Oh, oh, huh.

1013
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:19,309
Here's your
Good Burger. Huh.

1014
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:20,410
Little man,

1015
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:22,145
I ordered tomatoes
on this Good Burger.

1016
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,180
I don't see no tomatoes.

1017
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:25,915
Well, hang on. Uh.

1018
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,952
Huh!

1019
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,153
Consider yourself tomatoed.

1020
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,923
You're not like other people,
are you?

1021
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:34,190
No.

1022
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,658
Um, go-go on
ahead, Shaq.

1023
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,193
Take a bite
of the Good Burger,

1024
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:39,362
and tell us how
you like the good sauce.

1025
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:43,166
Tastes good, tastes good.

1026
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,668
You heard it
here, folks.

1027
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,671
Shaquille O'Neal,
a man who enjoys good food.

1028
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,804
Huh! Huh!

1029
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:51,074
Look, Dex, we're on live TV!

1030
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:53,042
Oh, welcome to Good Burger,

1031
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,577
home of the Good Burger.

1032
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:55,845
Can I take your order?

1033
00:41:55,844 --> 00:41:57,013
Huh. Whoa.

1034
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,748
I've never been on TV before.

1035
00:41:58,748 --> 00:41:59,749
Whoa. Hey.

1036
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:00,782

1037
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:01,884

1040
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:06,288
I'm sick of these pukes.
Shut up!

1041
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,193
You're not so fast

1042
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:11,961
with the trash talk now,
are you, huh?

1043
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,362
You got him that time, bro.

1044
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:15,198
Yeah, but if you
hadn't noticed,

1045
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,133
Good Burger is<i>
still</i> in business.

1046
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:19,368
Well, what are we supposed
to do about it?

1047
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,139
Our burgers are already twice
the size of theirs.

1048
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:27,009
Kitchen.

1049
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,545
Y-yes, sir.

1050
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,113
Make our burgers bigger.

1051
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:31,547
Bigger? But they're already...

1052
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:34,117
Bigger! Bigger!

1053
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:36,953
Now, let's see Good Burger

1054
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:40,556
go against burgers three times
the size of their own.

1055
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:42,125
Great.

1056
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,527
But what about
the Ed Sauce?

1057

1060
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,239
Welcome to Good Burger.

1061
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,773
Home of the Good Burger.

1062
00:42:57,773 --> 00:42:59,074
Can I take your order?

1063
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:00,476
You all right, bro?

1064
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:03,713
Hey, hey, hey.

1065
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:05,081
I know you.

1066
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:06,849
You're the dude
from Mondo Burger.

1067
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:08,217
Correct-a-mundo.

1068
00:43:08,217 --> 00:43:09,618
Kurt Bozwell.

1069
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:10,721
No, no, no.

1070
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:11,887
I'm Ed.

1071
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:14,023
Can I give you a lift, Ed?

1072
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:15,192
Oh, I don't know, dude.

1073
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,693
I weigh about 150.

1074
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:18,395
Just get in the car, huh?

1075
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:19,630
Oh, car?

1076
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,631
Yeah.

1077
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:23,766
Uh-oh.

1078
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,268
Uh-oh. Uh...!

1079
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:30,006
Ed, I'm going to cut
right to the chase.

1080
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,775
You have been working
at Good Burger now

1081
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,909
for like, what,
three years?

1082
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,344
And your manager
still only pays you

1083
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,546
five bucks an hour, man.

1084
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:37,681
Really? Cool!

1085
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:38,715
Huh.

1086
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:41,117
Well, five bucks
an hour's cool...

1087
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:43,018
How does... ten bucks sound?

1088
00:43:43,018 --> 00:43:44,520
Ten bucks.

1089
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,256
I don't know.

1090
00:43:47,423 --> 00:43:49,925
It sounds sort of like...

1091
00:43:53,496 --> 00:43:57,500
I want you to bail
on Good Burger, and I want you

1092
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,870
to come and work for me
at Mondo Burger.

1093
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:01,971
You make your sauce for Kurt.

1094
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,707
Who's Kurt?

1095
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:04,708
I'm Kurt.

1096
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,509
I'm Ed.

1097
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,175
I'm aware!

1098
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:07,543
You said you were Kurt.

1099
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,419
Well, uh, thanks
for the ride.

1100
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:19,021
Whenever you're ready
to come and work for me,

1101
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:20,023
you say the word.

1102
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,291
Okay.

1103
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,291
Mm.

1104
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:30,099
What were you doing
in Kurt's car?

1105
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:34,002
Oh, you know, just pushing
buttons and hanging out. Huh.

1106
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:35,238
What'd he say
to you?

1107
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:37,873
Something about working
at Mondo Burger.

1108
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:39,475
I think he likes me.

1109
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,746
Ed! That diphthong
doesn't like you!

1110
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,514
He just wants
to use you.

1111
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:47,317
Oh, well, that's not...
"natural."

1112
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,117
No.

1113
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:49,652
He wants your sauce.

1114
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:52,222
Look, don't tell him
the sauce recipe, all right?

1115
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,659
Because if you do, Good Burger's
going to be in big trouble.

1116
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,626
Okay.

1117
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:57,728
All right.

1118
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:57,728
Cool.

1119
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,463
Now, let's
get to work.

1120
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,463
All right.

1121
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:01,431
Um, Dex...

1122
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:03,699
Um, I got you something.

1123
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:04,867
Here.

1124
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:07,770
What, what is this?

1125
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,106
It's a yo-yo.

1126
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,608
I bought it
with the $13 you gave me.

1127
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,610
It lights up and
flickers and everything.

1128
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,878
Just like the one
your dad gave you.

1129
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:18,547
Why'd you get this for me?

1130
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:21,717
'Cause we're buds. Huh.

1131
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:22,719
Huh. Yeah.

1132
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,355
Huh. Huh.

1133
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,699
What's with this dude?

1134
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,534
He doesn't want to work
at Mondo Burger.

1135
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,934
If you ask me,

1136
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:40,804
the guy's a few tacos short
of a combination plate.

1137
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,072
I don't care.

1138
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,707
Now, Kurt's going to get
his sauce.

1139
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:45,440
I didn't come this far to let

1140
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,711
some tired crap shack like
Good Burger get in my way.

1141
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:50,681
Bring in Roxanne.

1142
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:58,222
If anyone can get the sauce

00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,254
Um, welcome to Good Burger,
home of the Good Burger.

1158
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:31,922
Can I take your order? Huh.

1159
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,556
No, thanks.

1160
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:36,260
I just came here
to see you, Ed.

1161
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,528
I'm Roxanne.

1162
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:39,730
Oh!

1163
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:43,432
Welcome to Good Burger,
home of the Good Burger.

1164
00:46:43,432 --> 00:46:44,867
Can I take your order? Huh.

1165
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,570
You are so hot.

1166
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:51,173
Oh, well, I often sweat
at work. Huh.

1167
00:46:51,173 --> 00:46:52,809
So, you hungry?

1168
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,744
Yes, I am hungry...

1169
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:57,046
but not for food.

1170
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:58,280
I'm hungry for you.

1171
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,183
Oh, well...
well, I'm not edible.

1172
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:02,552
Huh... Huh.

1173
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:05,556
How would you like
to go on date tomorrow night?

1174
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,722
With who?

1175
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:08,490
Me, silly.

1176
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,960
Huh. Me silly, too.

1177
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:13,329
No.

1178
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:16,299
I meant that you
and I should go out together

1179
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,867
tomorrow night.

1180
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:19,936
Want to?

1181
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:21,771
Oh, okay. Cool. Huh.

1182
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,039
Awesome.

1183
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,407
Here's my address.

1184
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:26,276
I'll see you at 8:00.

1185
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,617
I don't believe
what I just saw.

1186
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:35,751
Who? Elvis?

1187
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:37,954
No, a beautiful girl
just strode in here

1188
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:39,322
and asked you on a date.

1189
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:40,791
Oh, I know.
Hey, want to come?

1190
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,425
Oh, no. Three's
a crowd, man.

1191
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,561
Oh, well,
just bring a date.

1192
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,030
Hey, why don't
you ask Monique.

1193
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,166
I... I don't think so.

1194
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,567
Now, you know you
like her-- huh.

1195
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:51,869
How can I not like her?

1196
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,336
I mean, she's smart,
funny, beautiful...

1197
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:55,405
and cuddly.

1198
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:58,773
Oh, then just ask her out.

1199
00:47:58,773 --> 00:47:59,842
No.

1200
00:47:59,842 --> 00:48:01,411
Aw, what, you chicken?

1201
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,546
I'm not a chicken.

1202
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:04,047
Are too.

1203
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,782
Dexter's a chicken!

1204
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,517
Chicken! Moo!

1205
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:08,918
Moo!

1206
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:10,586
I'm not a chicken.

1207
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:12,655
It's just that I don't think
she wants to waste her time

1208
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:14,023
going out with me, that's all.

1209
00:48:14,023 --> 00:48:15,525
Moo!

1210
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,061
Chickens...!

1211
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,664
Chickens don't moo, man.

1212
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,465
They cluck.

1213
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:26,369
Hey, Monique,

1214
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:27,738
we're all going out
tomorrow night.

1215
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:29,239
You want to be Dexter's date?

1216
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,340
Look, man,
I told you...

1217
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,175
I'd love to.

1218
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,046
I, I knew she'd say yes.

1219
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,481
Moo!

00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:01,003
Your chair, Madame.

1228
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:04,239
Why, thank you, Dexter.

1229
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:06,609
Your chair. Huh!

1230
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,647
Um, is your butt okay?

1231
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:12,815
It's fine. Thank you.

1232
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:20,022
It's okay, people!

1233
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,392
Her butt is fine!

1234
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,829
Huh.

1235
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,335
Mmm! That's a great corn dog.

1236
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:34,402
Mm-hmm.

1237
00:49:34,402 --> 00:49:36,271
I wonder how they
get the weenie

1238
00:49:36,271 --> 00:49:37,806
into the corny
exterior? Yeah.

1239
00:49:37,806 --> 00:49:41,043
A question that's plagued
mankind for centuries.

1240
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:43,980
You know what'd go great
on these corn dogs?

1241
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,282
Um... a turtleneck?

1242
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:49,384
No, silly.
Some of your sauce.

1243
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:52,288
I just love your sauce.

1244
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:53,690
How do you make it?

1245
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,825
I'm dying to know.

1246
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:58,260
Well, first you
start off with some

1247
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,362
ketchup and some
lemon juice...

1248
00:50:00,362 --> 00:50:01,864
Ow!

1249
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:03,800
Oops.

1250
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,369
Oh, what's the matter?
Is it your butt?

1251
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:07,370
No.

1252
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:08,572
Uh, oh.

1253
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:09,739
Um...

1254
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:12,007
Wha-What do you say
we start putting?

1255
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,242
Ooh. I get to go first.

1256
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:14,510
All right. Word.

1257
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,512
Come on, Roxanne.

1258
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:20,250
Ed... can't we just go
somewhere and be alone?

1259
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,184
What for?

1260
00:50:22,184 --> 00:50:25,655
Well, maybe we could talk.

1261
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:28,959
Or maybe get to know
each other a little better.

1262
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:31,326
Now doesn't that
sound like more fun

1263
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:32,662
than miniature golf?

1264
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,767
No!

1265
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:39,402
Come on.

1266
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:46,675
♪ That's the way,
that's the way ♪

1267
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:48,777
♪ That's the way... ♪

1268
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:49,511
Oh...

1269
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:50,714
So close yet so far.

1270
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:53,215
My turn. Excuse me.
Thank you very much.

1271
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:55,784
All righty.

1272
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:56,786
Oh...

1273
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:57,554
Huh.

1274
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:00,490
Okay, yeah.

1275
00:51:01,657 --> 00:51:03,759
All right.
You're all right.

1276
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:06,663
Oh, oh...

1277
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:08,496
Mm-mm.

1278
00:51:08,496 --> 00:51:10,699
So, uh, is this
your first time?

1279
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:12,335
Uh-huh, keep talking.

1280
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,336
Mm-hmm.

1281
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:16,505
Huh. Okay, my turn.

1282
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:17,507
Huh, huh.

1283
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,711
Huh...

1284
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,880
Fore!

1285
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,458
Your turn.

1286
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:38,594
Then when I was six,
I said my first words.

1287
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:39,829
My mom thinks it was
"trousers,"

1288
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:41,231
but I think it
was "tweezers."

1289
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,867
And then I went to camp
and fell down a sand dune...

1290
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,669
Ed... Ed!

1291
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:48,103
She's still
unconscious, bro.

1292
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:49,437
Oh...

1293
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,474

please, baby, be my girl ♪

1296
00:52:04,686 --> 00:52:06,690
What happened?

1297
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,324
Your head hit my golf ball.

1298
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:09,692
Then you went sleepy-bye.

1299
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:13,963
Um... Monique,
you want to take a walk?

1300
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:14,764
Sure.

1301
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:15,832
Wait, wait, wait.

1302
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:17,900
What am I supposed to do?

1303
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,168
Hello!

1304
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:19,969
Hello.

1305
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:22,271
What am I
supposed to do?

1306
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:27,410
Ed... I think Roxanne can, uh,
help you figure something out.

1307
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:41,224
So, Ed...

1308
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,992
what do you want to do?

1309
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:45,528
Well, I always wanted
to shave a Martian.

1310
00:52:47,195 --> 00:52:48,398
Got a Martian. Huh!

1311
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,066
Here you go.

1312
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:52,601
Thank you.

1313
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:55,105
So, uh, you like me?

1314
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,740
Of course.

1315
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:58,607
So, uh... you like me?

1316
00:52:58,608 --> 00:52:59,842
Are you kidding?

1317
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:02,211
I liked you from the
first time I saw you--

1318
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,312
right off the bat.

1319
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,081
But I guess it was the
same for you, too, huh?

1320
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:09,818
No, actually, I thought you were
self-centered and obnoxious.

1321
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:13,922
Well, so much for
my self-esteem.

1322
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:16,358
I changed my mind,
didn't I?

1323
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:18,360
Yes, you did. How come?

1324
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,396
Ed.

1325
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:22,197
Excuse me.

1326
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:24,733
Ed thinks you're
a really great guy.

1327
00:53:24,733 --> 00:53:26,101
He's always talking about

1328
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:28,170
what a good friend
you are to him...

1329
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,306
and what a nice and caring
person you are.

1330
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:32,375
Really?

1331
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,110
Ed said all that?

1332
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,244
Mm-hmm.

1333
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:37,780
Ed is the sweetest,

1334
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,483
most genuine person
I've ever met.

1335
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:45,255
And, uh, anybody
he likes that much...

1336
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,423
can't be all bad.

1337

we've been through ♪

00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:01,436

00:54:01,436 --> 00:54:02,739
I'm looking.

1341
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,840
What do you see?

1342
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,809
That big red lump
on your forehead

1343
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:08,577
where the golf ball hit you.

1344
00:54:08,577 --> 00:54:09,679
Huh!

1345
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,514

Tell me how you make
your sauce...

1349
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:20,556
and I'll give you
anything you want.

1350
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:23,292
Uh, whatcha got?

1351
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,495
For starters...

1352
00:54:25,494 --> 00:54:27,763

00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:33,735
Sorry.

1357
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:35,471
You surprised me.

1358
00:54:35,471 --> 00:54:38,440
Can-can you breathe?

1359
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,481
I quit!

1360
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:54,255
I'm guessing she didn't get
the sauce recipe.

1361
00:54:54,255 --> 00:54:57,025
I'm aware.

1362
00:54:57,025 --> 00:54:58,560
Hello. My name is
Connie Mondune.

1363
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,731
I'm hosting a family reunion,
and my oven has run amok!

1364
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,733
Huh.

1365
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,733
I think it's
the heat actuator.

1366
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,268
Anywho, I'd like to order, uh

1367
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,670
three Good Meals,
four Junior Good Meals,

1368
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,903
and 17 orders
of your Good Chunks.

1369
00:55:08,903 --> 00:55:10,373
Um, okay, on two
of the Junior Good Meals,

1370
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,307
I need to substitute
the Good Cookies for Good Pies.

1371
00:55:12,307 --> 00:55:13,742
Now don't fret
if that's extra.

1372
00:55:13,742 --> 00:55:15,043
I'll pony up the overage.

1373
00:55:15,043 --> 00:55:16,645
And, uh, oh,
on the Regular Good Meals,

1374
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,281
I need two of the Good Burgers

1375
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,849
to have ketchup, mayo, mustard,
lettuce, tomato, but no onion.

1376
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,551
I've got an interview
this afternoon.

1377
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,987
Let's see, that takes care
of everyone but Uncle Leslie,

1378
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,423
who doesn't eat meat, but, of course,
he does eat dairy, so I don't get it.

1379
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:28,356
Let's get Leslie a Good Chick with some
Good Fries and a Good Root Beer.

1380
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:30,592
All to go. But I would like to
have my beverage while I wait.

1381
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:32,161
Now, total me up!

1382
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:42,404
Guess who.

1383
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:44,907
Hi, Dexter.

1384
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:47,410
Hey. What you doing?

1385
00:55:47,409 --> 00:55:48,644
Getting ready for work.

1386
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:50,045
Oh, cool, cool.

1387
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:54,250
Um, listen, since we had
such a nice time last night,

1388
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,753
uh, I thought that maybe
we could do it again tonight.

1389
00:55:58,753 --> 00:56:00,389
I don't think so.

1390
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,727
Okay. Tomorrow night, then?

1391
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:05,994
No.

1392
00:56:05,994 --> 00:56:08,230
Well, maybe this weekend?

1393
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,467
Maybe not.

1394
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,001
Okay.

1395
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,737
Who are you and what have done
with the real Monique?

1396
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:16,338
Oh, she's right here.

1397
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:20,375
It's just that now,
she knows the real Dexter.

1398
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,812
Come again?

1399
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:24,547
You forgot your jacket
last night.

1400
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,813
Oh. Thank you.

1401
00:56:25,813 --> 00:56:27,916
And this fell
out of the pocket.

1402
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,223
Oh, um... this?

1403
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:36,925
This is just,
all it is...

1404
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:38,460
All-All it is...

1405
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,295
Right, it's just the
contract you had Ed sign.

1406
00:56:40,295 --> 00:56:42,931
You know, the one where, uh,
you take most of his money.

1407
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:45,667
The money he's supposed
to get for his sauce.

1408
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,702
No... yeah.

1409
00:56:46,702 --> 00:56:48,037
But, look,
I was just trying...

1410
00:56:48,036 --> 00:56:49,203
You know,
I can't believe

1411
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:50,806
that you would do
something like that

1412
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:52,375
to someone who trusts you.

1413
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,911
How can you take advantage
of a sweet person like Ed?!

1414
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,244
And after
he got you a job?!

1415
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:57,679
It ain't even like that.

1416
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:58,681
I only wanted...

1417
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,583
Oh, I know what you wanted.

1418
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,050
You're not Ed's friend.

1419
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,619
You're just using him

1420
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:05,554
to scam a little
cash on the side.

1421
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:07,490
It must feel really good.

1422
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:11,594
Babe...

1423
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:11,594
Oh, but don't worry.

1424
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:15,130
I'm not going to tell Ed
that you're cheating him.

1425
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,498
Why not?

1426
00:57:16,498 --> 00:57:20,569
Because it would hurt him
too much.

1427
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,849
Punk.

1428
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:35,552
Mmm!

1429
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,896
There you are, Ed.

1430
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,764
Um, can I sit here?

1431
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:50,332
On my lap?

1432
00:57:50,331 --> 00:57:51,467
No, man.

1433
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:53,570
I'll just sit down
right next to you.

1434
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:56,804
All right, look, Ed,

1435
00:57:56,804 --> 00:57:58,607
I don't know
how to say this.

1436
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,643
Oh, you just go:

1437
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:04,246
"This."

1438
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:06,981
No, um, I-I'm talking
about this contract.

1439
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,454
What is it, boy?

1440
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,956
Oh, wha...? What?

1441
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:15,191
Four clowns?!

1442
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,059
Their car's broken down?

1443
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,461
They're in trouble?

1444
00:58:19,461 --> 00:58:21,530
Man, that dog is
not talking to you.

1445
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,532
W-w-wait, hang on.

1446
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,666
He's trying to tell us

1447
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,667
that there's four clowns
stuck somewhere

1448
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:26,935
and their car broke down.

1449
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,771
Where, boy, where?

1450
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,006
Ed, there
are no clowns.

1451
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:33,875
Man, that dog
is just hungry.

1452
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:37,347
Oh, well, maybe
we should feed him.

1453
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:42,518
Here, have
a Mondo Burger.

1454
00:58:44,686 --> 00:58:46,889
Huh.

1455
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:49,157
He's not
eating it.

1456
00:58:49,157 --> 00:58:50,625
Well, what's wrong?

1457
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:52,028
I don't know.

1458
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:54,329
He definitely looks hungry,
though.

1459
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:55,431
Yeah.

1460
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,434
Well, here.

1461
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,303
Try a Good Burger.

1462
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:05,407
Would you
look at that?

1463
00:59:05,407 --> 00:59:06,476
See, I told you

1464
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,144
there was something wrong
with Mondo Burger.

1465
00:59:09,144 --> 00:59:12,447
He knows it,
don't you, boy?

1466
00:59:12,447 --> 00:59:14,382
He definitely
senses something

1467
00:59:14,382 --> 00:59:16,117
that he doesn't like.

1468
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:18,153
What do you think
it could be?

1469
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:20,255
I don't know.

1470
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:22,958
Let's find out.

1471
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,529
Where is that dang dog?

1472
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:36,405
Excuse me, ladies,
may I help you?

1473
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:38,874
Could you kindly point us
in the direction

1474
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:40,007
of the little girls' room?

1475
00:59:40,007 --> 00:59:41,443
Yes, ma'am.
The ladies room

1476
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:43,945
is just on the other side
of the restaurant.

1477
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:45,014
I'll show you.

1478
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,181
Oh, get your hands

1479
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:47,916
Ma'am!

1480
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:47,916
Off of me!

1481
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:49,318
I'm mighty mad...

1482
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:51,153
Ma'am, I'm just trying to help.

1483
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:53,355
I don't need your... oh!

1484
00:59:53,355 --> 00:59:54,289
Oh! Oh!

1485
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:57,058
Water! Water!

1486
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:58,795
I need water!

1487
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,864
Whoo! Water! Oh!

1488
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,065
Water! Ooh!

1489
01:00:03,065 --> 01:00:05,267
Water! Oh! Water! Oh!

1490
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:07,101
Okay, I'll be right back.

1491
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:09,771
Water!
Water, water, water!

1492
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:11,639
Whoo! Oh, oh.

1493
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:13,007
All right, let's go.

1494
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:14,909
Hey, what about
your water?

1495
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:16,712
Would you just come on?!

1496
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:44,405
H-hey, what's that stuff

1497
01:00:44,405 --> 01:00:46,041
they're dropping
in the burgers?

1498
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,643
I don't know,
but I bet

1499
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:50,713
that's what's making
those burgers grow so big.

1500
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:53,548
We should get some of
that stuff for Good Burger.

1501
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:56,184
No, man, stuff like
that's got to be illegal.

1502
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:58,186
It is illegal.

1503
01:00:58,186 --> 01:01:00,123
Whoo! Oh...!

1504
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,427
Triambythal

1505
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:08,230
is <i>way</i> illegal.

1506
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,199
But I tell you what.

1507
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:13,769
It sure makes burgers
nice and "enormo."

1508
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:15,905
Oh, yeah, that's all
well and good, but

1509
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:16,972
what happens
to all those

1510
01:01:16,972 --> 01:01:18,240
nice, innocent people

1511
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,376
when they eat your
"enormo" burgers?

1512
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:23,613
Uh-oh.
Don't care, ladies.

1513
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:28,284
Ooh! Uh...

1514
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,091
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.

1515
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:36,458
Uh-huh.

1516
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,025
But when those people find out

1517
01:01:38,025 --> 01:01:39,661
that you're putting
illegal stuff in their meat

1518
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:41,663
you're going to find
yourself in jail.

1519
01:01:41,663 --> 01:01:45,132
That is why
nobody outside this kitchen

1520
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:46,801
is going to find out.

1521
01:01:46,802 --> 01:01:49,938
What do you expect us to do,
keep our mouths shut?

1522
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:52,673
No. I'll keep your mouths shut.

1523
01:01:52,673 --> 01:01:55,777
Ed, run!

1524
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:03,652
Okay, hot pants,

1525
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:06,521
now, I'm tired
of playing games.

1526
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:09,023
I want to know
what's in your sauce.

1527
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,326
Well, you can forget it.

1528
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,161
You're not going
to get Ed's sauce.

1529
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:17,900
I want to know
what's in your sauce.

1530
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,635
Dude, you need a Tic Tac.

1531
01:02:20,635 --> 01:02:22,036
Ha-ha!

1532
01:02:22,036 --> 01:02:23,204
That coils it.

1533
01:02:23,204 --> 01:02:24,574
You guys are grass.

1534
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,108
What are we going
to do with them?

1535
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:30,311
Get our pal Wade on the phone.

1536
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:32,447
Demented Hills?

1537
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:35,251
Hmm.

1538
01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:55,603
Hey, all right,
yeah, hey, easy, man, easy.

1539
01:02:55,603 --> 01:02:58,206
Yeah, all right,
uh-huh, see, you'd like to...

1540
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:00,409
You'll never be
half the man your mama was.

1541
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,912
Hey, man,
you better let me go!

1542
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,248
Hey, man, open the door!

1543
01:03:07,248 --> 01:03:10,018
I'm not going to tell you again!

1544
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:13,221
All right, maybe I'll tell you
one more time.

1545
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,357
Open this door, please?! Oh...!

1546
01:03:15,356 --> 01:03:17,226
Look, Dex, the
walls are padded!

1547
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,427
Look what I can do!

1548
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,174
I don't get it.

1549
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:33,407
I-I just don't get it.

1550
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:34,643
Where could they be?

1551
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:36,545
I'm really worried,
you guys.

01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:48,857
Hi.

1558
01:03:48,856 --> 01:03:50,559
Uh, huh... hi.

1559
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,294
I'm a psychopath.

1560
01:03:52,293 --> 01:03:54,028
I'm Ed.

1561
01:03:54,028 --> 01:03:56,931
Have small space aliens
ever landed in your brain

1562
01:03:56,931 --> 01:03:59,166
and told you
to break into the zoo

1563
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:01,136
and free
the kangaroos?

1564
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,705
Not that I recall.

1565
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:04,039
Do you think I'm cute?

1566
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:06,074
Sure. Huh.

1567
01:04:06,074 --> 01:04:07,842
What's cute about me?

1568
01:04:07,842 --> 01:04:10,679
Um... your head.

1569
01:04:12,313 --> 01:04:14,248
You have a cute head, too.

1570
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,219
Well, I try to keep it nice.

1571
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:19,922
So, what you in for?

1572
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,490
I got in trouble
for breaking into the zoo

1573
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,559
and freeing all the kangaroos.

1574
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,596
Oh.

1575
01:04:28,195 --> 01:04:29,797
My name is Heather.

1576
01:04:29,797 --> 01:04:32,934
Really? My mom's
name is Heather.

1577
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:34,369
Really?

1578
01:04:35,737 --> 01:04:36,805
No.

1579
01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:39,740
I like you, Ed.

1580
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,543
Oh.

1581
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:46,514
Uh... go fish.

1582
01:04:49,284 --> 01:04:51,052
Would you stop
eating the cards?

1583
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:52,354
And quit poking me.

1584
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:53,588
Are you crazy?

1585
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:58,793
Man...!

1586
01:04:58,793 --> 01:05:02,463
I got to play cards
with these folk?!

1587
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,132
Would you quit it?!

1588
01:05:04,132 --> 01:05:05,835
You're nasty!

1589
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:09,438
Ah, hey, dude.

1590
01:05:11,773 --> 01:05:14,476
Hey, they gave me a jacket
just like that.

1591
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:17,412
Need some help?

1592
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,516
Huh! Okay.

1593
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,627
He's loose!
Look out!

1594
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:37,365
Oh! Goodness gracious,
he's killing Sidney!

1595
01:05:47,876 --> 01:05:49,812
Open it.

1596
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:05,594
There's the fridge.

1597
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,329
Go get the
sauce, dudes.

1598
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,767
Got it.

1599
01:06:31,152 --> 01:06:33,921
What's going on
in here?

1600
01:06:33,922 --> 01:06:37,293
Stop waving
that dang light in my face.

1601
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,393
Who are you?

1602
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:39,894
Your mama.
Who are you?

1603
01:06:39,894 --> 01:06:40,862
Relax.

1604
01:06:40,862 --> 01:06:42,197
It's the old guy
that works here.

1605
01:06:42,197 --> 01:06:43,899
Well, what are you doing here
this late?

1606
01:06:43,898 --> 01:06:45,567
Sleeping,
till you woke my butt up.

1607
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,570
What's that junk
you're pouring into our sauce?

1608
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,037
Shut up, old man.

1609
01:06:49,036 --> 01:06:51,773
Don't be rude
to the elderly.

1610
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:54,442
The old man asked
us a question.

1611
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,879
Now, it's called
shark poison,

1612
01:06:56,878 --> 01:06:59,081
and it's going
to make all

1613
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:03,452
your little Good Burger
customers very, very sick.

1614
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:04,686
So sick that
I doubt anybody

1615
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:06,187
will ever want to
eat here again.

1616
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:07,422
I'm calling the cops.

1617
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,061
You're not
calling anyone.

1618
01:07:14,195 --> 01:07:15,297
In you go.

1619
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,565
Join your buddies.

1620
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:18,833
Otis?

1621
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,602
Otis, you came to visit, huh?

1622
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:24,606
Oh, I'm fine, and you?

1623
01:07:24,606 --> 01:07:27,076
Help me get him
out of this!

1624
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,347
Do I look like
I came to visit?!

1625
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:33,382
Where am I?

1626
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,449
What's going on?

1627
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:35,550
They kidnapped us.

1628
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,018
Why'd they bring
you here?

1629
01:07:37,018 --> 01:07:39,587
'Cause I caught those
little Mondo brats

1630
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,456
dumping shark
poison in our sauce.

1631
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,024
Shark poison?!

1632
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:45,994
Wow, why do they want to harm
those innocent sharks?

1633
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:47,895
Will you forget
about the sharks?

1634
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:50,432
That stuff's going
to harm innocent people.

1635
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:51,567
Can you get
to a phone?

1636
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,900
There's no chance.

1637
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,469
We got to get out
of this place.

1638
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:55,503
What time is it?

1639
01:07:55,503 --> 01:07:56,704
I'll tell you.

1640
01:07:56,704 --> 01:07:58,173
It's 6:00 a.m.

1641
01:07:58,173 --> 01:07:59,608
Good Burger opens at 10:00.

1642
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:02,077
That means we only got

1804
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:26,747
And a little bit of that! Huh!

1805
01:16:26,747 --> 01:16:29,150
Have some raspberry sorbet!

1806
01:16:31,752 --> 01:16:34,088
How do you like me now?

1807
01:16:34,088 --> 01:16:37,259
I'm a dude throwing ice cream!

1808
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:40,627
French vanilla! Yeah!

1809
01:16:40,627 --> 01:16:41,896
Take some chocolate!

1810
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:43,898
Yeah! Fudge!

1811
01:16:43,898 --> 01:16:45,567
Oh! Yeah, there you go, baby!

1812
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:46,967
Oh...

1813
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:49,336
Yeah, they're going to have you
on <i>This Old Homey.</i>

1814
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:51,473
Nice box, Wheat.

1815
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:52,440
Yeah?

1816
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:58,045
I can't see.

1817
01:16:58,045 --> 01:16:59,947
I can't see!

1818
01:17:00,847 --> 01:17:02,783
No! No!

1819
01:17:02,783 --> 01:17:04,819
Watch it, fellas! Stop!

1820
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,054
Whew!

1821
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,556
Look out!
Look out!

1822
01:17:07,555 --> 01:17:08,289
Oh, no! Come on!

1823
01:17:13,094 --> 01:17:16,163
Whoo! Lost 'em.

1824
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,702
Hi. Welcome
to Good Burger,

1825
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:21,702
home of the Good Burger.

1826
01:17:21,702 --> 01:17:23,204
Can I take your order?

1827
01:17:23,204 --> 01:17:26,140
I'll have a Good Burger...
with extra sauce.

1828
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,241
Oh! That sounds delightful.

1829
01:17:28,242 --> 01:17:29,744
I'll have the same thing.

1830
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,815
Better step on it.

1831
01:17:33,814 --> 01:17:35,216
Whoa!

1832
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:40,921
Two
Good Burgers, extra sauce.

1833
01:17:40,921 --> 01:17:42,356
Thank you.

1834
01:17:50,297 --> 01:17:53,667
Oh, poo. I wanted mustard.

1835
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,740
Ed, hurry!

1836
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,175
Don't let anyone eat
a Good Burger.

1837
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:03,412
Come on, Otis.

1838
01:18:05,846 --> 01:18:08,382
No!

1839
01:18:17,858 --> 01:18:18,960
Get him off me.

1840
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,096
What's going on?
What the...?

1841
01:18:21,095 --> 01:18:23,564
Ed! Ed! Ed!
What are you doing?

1842
01:18:23,564 --> 01:18:24,731
Ed, get off!

1843
01:18:24,731 --> 01:18:26,768
Ed, off the elderly.

1844
01:18:27,868 --> 01:18:30,371
Ed!

1845
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:31,538
Ed, Ed, are you okay?

1846
01:18:31,538 --> 01:18:32,506
What happened?

1847
01:18:32,506 --> 01:18:34,074
I just tackled
some old lady.

1848
01:18:34,074 --> 01:18:35,042
Cool.

1849
01:18:34,074 --> 01:18:35,042
All right, Ed!

1850
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:36,376
Way to go.

1851
01:18:36,377 --> 01:18:38,879
Excuse me, would one of you two
mind telling me

1852
01:18:38,878 --> 01:18:40,347
why this is a good thing?

1853
01:18:40,347 --> 01:18:43,650
This is why-- Mondo Burger
poisoned our sauce.

1854
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:46,253
How could Mondo Burger
poison our sauce?

1855
01:18:46,253 --> 01:18:47,721
We'll explain it to you later.

1856
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:50,391
Right now, just keep everyone
from eating that sauce,

1857
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:51,658
and call the cops.

1858
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:52,893
Come on, Ed.

1859
01:18:52,893 --> 01:18:54,028
Where are we going?

1860
01:18:54,028 --> 01:18:55,530
To get a can
of triambythal.

1861
01:18:55,529 --> 01:18:56,530
What for?

1862
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:57,532
Proof.

1863
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:58,332
Okay.

1864
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:03,238
I need a hot Jacuzzi.

1865
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,453
Shall I ring?

1866
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:20,787
No!

1867
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:22,956
Man, you can't just walk
up there and ring the bell

1868
01:19:22,957 --> 01:19:24,559
and say "Howdy do, neighbor."

1869
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:27,228
We got to find a way to sneak
into the kitchen somehow.

1870
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:29,931
I got an idea. Huh.

1871
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,198
Follow me.

1872
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:33,601
Where are you doing?

1873
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,003
Oh, dear, careful.

1874
01:19:36,002 --> 01:19:37,103
Maybe you should...

1875
01:19:37,104 --> 01:19:38,539
I don't know if...

1876
01:19:38,538 --> 01:19:43,777
Whoo! Shouldn't you have
a harness or some rope?

1877
01:19:43,778 --> 01:19:45,279
Come on, it's easy!

1878
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,283
Yeah, easy for you!

1879
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:49,484
Dang!

1880
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,052
Climb on a truck?!

1881
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:54,255
I don't even know the person
that owns this truck.

1882
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,557
And I got
to do my thing...

1883
01:19:56,557 --> 01:19:57,792
Yeah.

1884
01:19:57,792 --> 01:19:59,694
Now... all right,

1885
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:01,296
now jump on
that pipe thingy.

1886
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,097
I... I'm... I'm...

1887
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:05,634
Whoo!

1888
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:08,203
See?

1889
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:12,073
Oh!

1890
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,642
All right.

1891
01:20:13,641 --> 01:20:14,975
You got it.

1892
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:18,813
Got what?
I'm swinging from a dang pipe.

1893
01:20:18,813 --> 01:20:22,250
Mama?

1894
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:35,664
Whew!

1895
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:37,965
Ed...

1896
01:20:37,965 --> 01:20:40,301
Ed.

1897
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:41,303
Ed!

1898
01:20:41,302 --> 01:20:42,302
Over here!

1899
01:20:42,302 --> 01:20:44,271
Over here. Come on!

1900
01:20:44,271 --> 01:20:45,739
What are you doing
in the straw?

1901
01:20:45,739 --> 01:20:48,643
It's right over the kitchen.
I can see it!

1902
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:49,510
Come on!

1903
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:51,345
How do expect me
to get up there?

1904
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:52,713
Oh, it's easy.

1905
01:20:52,712 --> 01:20:54,782
You just jump on the burger,
jump on the fry,

1906
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:57,685
and then you hop on the cup,
and then shimmy up the straw.

1907
01:20:57,685 --> 01:21:00,688
What is this,<i>
American Gladiators?</i>

1908
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:01,756
Come on!

1909
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,025
All right.

1910
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,298
Can't believe this man
got me...

1911
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:13,134
climbing on a straw!

1912
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:18,372
Ooh! Wow, Good Burger looks
so small from up here.

1913
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:24,077
Ed? Ed, Ed, are you in there?

1914
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:26,982
Here, take my hand.

1915
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,827
Ed? Ed?!

1916
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,194
Whee!

1917
01:21:40,194 --> 01:21:42,029
Again! Again!
That was cool!

1918
01:21:42,029 --> 01:21:43,397
Shh! Listen, listen.

1919
01:21:43,396 --> 01:21:44,532
I'm gonna go into that kitchen.

1920
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:45,900
Then I want you to count to ten,

1921
01:21:45,899 --> 01:21:47,634
and come in there and get a can
of that chemical

1922
01:21:47,635 --> 01:21:49,704
and hightail it back
to Good Burger, all right?

1923
01:21:49,703 --> 01:21:51,840
All right, okay.
All right.

1924
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:55,243
One...

1925
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:59,014
two... three...

1926
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:04,585
Hey, everybody!

1927
01:22:04,585 --> 01:22:05,619
What's happening?

1928
01:22:05,619 --> 01:22:06,654
How'd you get here?

1929
01:22:06,654 --> 01:22:08,956
Ooh! Look at this fancy kitchen.

1930
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,693
You know, Mama never had
one of these

1931
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,360
with the electronic numbers.

1932
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:14,862
We always
had to turn the knobs...

1933
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:15,697
Let's get him!

1934
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,632
...wait for the little ding...

1935
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:20,734
If I were you...

1936
01:22:20,734 --> 01:22:23,371
I wouldn't come <i>any</i> closer.

1937
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:24,905
Get him.

1938
01:22:35,048 --> 01:22:35,884
Get him!

1939
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:39,387
Come on, guys.

1940
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:41,689
Let's go! Let's go!

1941
01:22:48,127 --> 01:22:50,064
♪ Oh... ♪

1942
01:22:55,868 --> 01:22:56,804
Ooh!

1943
01:23:03,043 --> 01:23:05,079
♪ Oh, oh. ♪

1944
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:06,613
Mm-mm.

1945
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:28,436
Go! Around
the other way!

1946
01:23:37,845 --> 01:23:41,181
All right, punk...
the game is over.

1947
01:23:41,181 --> 01:23:42,449
Yeah. Your game is over,

1948
01:23:42,449 --> 01:23:43,818
because right now,
my man Ed

1949
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,985
is on his way down
to the police station

1950
01:23:45,985 --> 01:23:49,222
with a can
of your illegal triambythal.

1951
01:23:49,222 --> 01:23:50,057
Ha!

1952
01:23:50,057 --> 01:23:52,592
Hey, Dex, got it! Huh.

1953
01:23:52,592 --> 01:23:54,662
Get it!

1954
01:23:52,592 --> 01:23:54,662
Give me that.

1955
01:23:52,592 --> 01:23:54,662
Oh!

1956
01:23:56,463 --> 01:23:58,865
Nice try, dudes,
but you mess with Kurt,

1957
01:23:58,865 --> 01:24:00,601
and you go in the grinder.

1958
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:02,068
Here you go, boss.

1959
01:24:02,069 --> 01:24:04,005
Thanks, Holmes.

1960
01:24:05,471 --> 01:24:07,173
This can's empty.

1961
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,344
What an idiot.

1962
01:24:10,344 --> 01:24:12,113
Stole an empty can.

1963
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:14,716
Ed, you stole a empty can?!

1964
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:18,520
It wasn't empty when
I found it. Huh.

1965
01:24:44,278 --> 01:24:46,114
Oh...

1966
01:24:44,278 --> 01:24:46,114
Hey!

1967
01:24:46,113 --> 01:24:47,381
What's going on?

1968
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:48,715
I don't know.

1969
01:25:04,565 --> 01:25:06,099
The kitchen! Go!

1970
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,802
Come on!

1971
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:10,637
Come on.

1972
01:25:10,637 --> 01:25:12,539
Come on, Ed, let's go!

1973
01:25:23,449 --> 01:25:25,485
Grill! We got to
stop the grill!

1974
01:25:25,485 --> 01:25:26,688
Oh...

1975
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:31,392
Let's get out of here!

1976
01:26:09,796 --> 01:26:12,199
Must be a shift change.

1977
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:16,570
Huh?

1978
01:26:34,387 --> 01:26:35,823
Why?

1979
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:37,825
Why?

1980
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:40,327
What have I done?

1981
01:26:44,631 --> 01:26:47,333
What,
are you going to put cuffs on me, huh?

1982
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:48,668
Wha...?

1983
01:26:48,668 --> 01:26:50,104
Relax, sir, it's
going to be okay.

1984
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:51,972
You tell me if these
are too tight, all right?

1985
01:26:51,971 --> 01:26:53,106
You don't understand!

1986
01:26:53,106 --> 01:26:54,574
But none of this
is my fault, okay?

1987
01:26:54,574 --> 01:26:55,708
I mean...

1988
01:26:54,574 --> 01:26:55,708
I don't know.

1989
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:57,110
Hey, let's go
help him out. Huh.

1990
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:58,378
Let's.

1991
01:26:58,378 --> 01:27:00,381
Listen,
I can explain everything.

1992
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,615
This is all just a
big misunderstanding.

1993
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:06,319
I don't understand.
I don't know what happened.

1994
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:07,353
Oh, sure you do.

1995
01:27:07,354 --> 01:27:08,489
Why don't you go on ahead

1996
01:27:08,488 --> 01:27:09,823
and tell
your little police friend

1997
01:27:09,823 --> 01:27:11,458
that you made
your big Beefy Burgers

1998
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:13,426
all big and beefy

1999
01:27:13,426 --> 01:27:14,795
by using illegal
food additives.

2000
01:27:14,795 --> 01:27:15,962
Is that true?

2001
01:27:15,962 --> 01:27:17,297
No! He's lying!
You're lying!

2002
01:27:17,297 --> 01:27:18,465
You're full
of crap!

2003
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,501
Yeah? Well, why don't
we just check these out,

2004
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:21,702
and we'll see who's lying.

2005
01:27:21,702 --> 01:27:22,936
I think you better
come with us.

2006
01:27:22,936 --> 01:27:24,372
Man, you're out
of your minds.

2007
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,840
You're crazy, man!

2008
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,306
You know who I am? Huh?

2009
01:27:27,306 --> 01:27:28,341
Yeah, I know,
I know.

2010
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:29,475
Bye-bye.

2011
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:29,475
Hey, hey,

2012
01:27:29,475 --> 01:27:30,810

2013

with Good Burger...

2014
01:27:32,579 --> 01:27:34,648
you go in the grinder!

2015
01:27:35,681 --> 01:27:36,750
Oh, dog,

01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,351

I can't, I can't...

I can fix it. Uh!

2030
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:05,946
Uh, Mr. Wheat?

2031
01:28:05,945 --> 01:28:07,282
I don't have
a lot of time,

2032
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,882
but I do got a
couple words for you.

2033
01:28:08,882 --> 01:28:10,350
Look here.

2034
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:11,684
Here's about half
of the money

2035
01:28:11,685 --> 01:28:13,020
that I owe you
for your car,

2036
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:14,588
and I guess I'll
have the other half

2037
01:28:14,587 --> 01:28:15,855
by the end of the summer.

2038
01:28:15,855 --> 01:28:17,623
You enjoy your car!

2039
01:28:17,623 --> 01:28:19,025
Bye-bye, now.

2040
01:28:19,025 --> 01:28:20,327
I'll give you some money.
Help me out!

2041
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:21,796
Man, just help me
get the burger off.

2042
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:23,963
Ooh-hoo, come on, Ed.

2043
01:28:23,963 --> 01:28:25,365
Huh.

2044
01:28:25,365 --> 01:28:27,568
So, <i>you</i> poured that stuff
in that meat, didn't you?

2045
01:28:27,568 --> 01:28:28,569
Huh, I had to.

2046
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:29,837
You <i>had</i> to?

2047
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,606
Sure. See, I knew
if I took the can,

2048
01:28:31,605 --> 01:28:34,140
there was a good chance
I'd get caught. Huh.

2049
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:36,042
Then I thought,
even if I did take

2050
01:28:36,042 --> 01:28:38,311
the triambythal to
the proper authorities,

2051
01:28:38,311 --> 01:28:41,047
huh, Kurt would hire some
high-powered attorneys

2052
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:42,716
who would dispute
any charges

2053
01:28:42,716 --> 01:28:44,717
brought against him
or Mondo Burger,

2054
01:28:44,717 --> 01:28:46,386
by manipulating
the legal system.

2055
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:48,554
And the way that
America's court system

2056
01:28:48,555 --> 01:28:50,124
is congested these days,

2057
01:28:50,123 --> 01:28:53,027
it would have taken months
to convict him of anything.

2058
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,427
So then I thought,

2059
01:28:54,427 --> 01:28:56,329
I'll take matters
into my own hands

2060
01:28:56,329 --> 01:28:58,064
and just pour
the triambythal

2061
01:28:58,064 --> 01:29:00,400
into the meat supply
and let Mondo Burger

2062
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,536
be a victim of
its own foul play.

2063
01:29:02,536 --> 01:29:03,938
Ha! Huh!

2064
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:05,572
Oh, wait-wait-
wait-wait.

2065
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:08,676
You thought of all that?

2066
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,411
Yeah, sure.

2067
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:12,244
I'm not stupid. Huh.

2068
01:29:12,244 --> 01:29:13,314
Huh.

2069
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:16,584
Well, look, Ed,
about this contract, man,

2070
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:19,219
what do you say we just...
forget it?

2071
01:29:19,219 --> 01:29:22,123
Wait, y-you don't
want to be partners?

2072
01:29:22,122 --> 01:29:23,256
Well, no.

2073
01:29:23,256 --> 01:29:24,057
See...

2074
01:29:24,057 --> 01:29:25,225
Is it because I'm black?

2075
01:29:26,359 --> 01:29:28,594
No, it's not because
you're...

2076
01:29:28,595 --> 01:29:29,829
'cause <i>I'm...</i>

2077
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:31,164
All right, look, forget it.

2078
01:29:31,164 --> 01:29:32,699
All right,
we can be partners,

2079
01:29:32,699 --> 01:29:34,434
but the money is yours,
all right?

2080
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:35,936
All of it.

2081
01:29:35,935 --> 01:29:37,337
So, we're still buddies?

2082
01:29:37,337 --> 01:29:39,472
Oh, you know it.

2083
01:29:39,472 --> 01:29:40,474
Cool. Huh.

2084
01:29:40,474 --> 01:29:41,408
Um, Dexter?

2085
01:29:41,408 --> 01:29:42,276
Huh?

2086
01:29:42,275 --> 01:29:44,711
I-I just want to
say that, well,

2087
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:47,581
I'm really going
to miss you...

2088

a lot.

2089
01:29:49,015 --> 01:29:52,219
And, um... I will
always remember you,
