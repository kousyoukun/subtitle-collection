What's your hurry, my brother?

171
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:31,624
Huh, my hurry

172
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,826
is that it's now
officially summer vacation

173
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:37,129
and yet,
I'm still looking at you.

174
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,064
You're an amazing student.
I mean, you sit there,

175
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,432
you get your
test done first

176
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,067
and you were
concentrating so hard,

177
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,235
I thought you were asleep.

178
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,170
Next time make it
more challenging.

179
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,472
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

180
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:48,973
Challenges, potential,
using your mind,

181
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:50,209
'cause I'm worried about you.

182
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,110
I'm worried about you, too.

183
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,247
Have you seen yourself lately?

The 'fro, the boots,
and this jacket...

You have
a nice summer, Shaft.

So, uh, how you think
you did on your exam?

00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:23,509
Sorry, summer vacation
started 48 seconds ago.

work or anything of that nature

for the next three months.

This yours?

196
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,156
No, it's my mom's,

197
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,425
but she's away on
business in New York.

198
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,463
And she lets you drive this
while she's out of town?

No.

to work without his pants.

Oh.

211
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,790
Now, please, make this delivery.

212
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,956
The address is on the back.

for the summer?

Ha! Let me tell you, boy,

217
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,934
I plan to wake up every
day at around noon,

218
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,002
then I'm going to
lay out by the pool,

219
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,437
order some Chinese food,

220
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,774
maybe invite some fine
females over to share

an egg roll
or two.

222
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:32,210
Then I'm going to
wake up the next day,

223
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,679
do it all over again.

224

will help you out.

I'll get the money.

We'll just call...

No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

I will... I'll...

I'll... I'll...

I'll...

339
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:16,302
I'll get a summer job.

00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:23,841
MAN:
Bun, patty,
topping, sauce, assemble.

Bun, patty, topping, sauce,

Bun, patty, topping,
sauce, assemble.

343
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:37,956
Come here, little bun.

344
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,557
Oh, beef patty.

(<i> grunting</i> )

346
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,199
Okay, yeah.
Ooh, that's nasty.

347
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,501
All right.

348
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,068
Yo, my man,
can I borrow some lettuce?

349
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,070
Can I borrow  some...

00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,973
You.

Who?

353
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:56,741
You! Look at this mess.

354
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,043
I, I can explain.

355
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,678
See, I was trying to put
the big old beef patty...

356
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,914
oh, on the bottom half
of the bun, you know,

357
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,815
before the tomato
gets all slippery

358
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,351
with the... ooh,
that's slippery.

359
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,919
Oh, I'm sorry.
And then, you know,

360
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,355
the pickle bits was
making me do the wrong...

361
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,124
because they're,
they're flexible,

362
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,192
they're not crunchy.

363
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,360
And...

364
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,861
Yo, man, back me up on this.

365
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:19,463
(<i> blowing</i> )

366
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:19,463
Oh, again with
the whistle.

367
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,233
Shut up. Just be quiet.

368
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,667
It'd be a lot more quiet

369
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,836
if you stopped
blowing the whistle.

370
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:25,803
Watch your mouth,

371
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:27,405
you pestiferous
little maggot.

372
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:30,274
Now, I'm familiar
with the term "maggot"

373
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,742
but... pestiferous?

374
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:35,514
Burn this into the front row
of your brain, chuckles.

375
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,850
If there's one thing
Kurt cannot stand

376
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,384
it is an incompetent,
bumbling, sloppy,

377

fast food employee.

378
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,159
Yum.

00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,160
Yeah.

Ed!

381
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,431
What are you doing inside
the milk shake machine?

382
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:56,134
Oh, trying to fix it.

383
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,169
Did you turn on the switch?

384
00:13:58,169 --> 00:13:59,870
No.

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,243
Ah.

Whoo!

00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:07,278
Whoa...

00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,846
Yeah...

Oh-ho, oy-yoi!

393
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,223
People, I'm fully stoked

394
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:22,093
about being in charge
of every single one of you.

395
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:26,431
Within two years,
Mondo Burger's going to be

396
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:30,201
the<i> biggest</i> burger chain
on this planet.

397
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:31,937
Oh, yeah.

398
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,171
First we got to beat out

399
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:36,206
our big competition across
the street, Good Burger.

400

(<i> both laughing</i> )

401
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,314
From now on,

402
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:45,750
your<i> life</i> is
Mondo Burger.

403
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,419
You can forget
about your friends,

404
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,854
you can forget
about your family,

405
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:56,729
because Kurt... is now both
your mother and your father.

406
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:00,230
Kurt must look
awfully strange naked.

(<i> snickering</i> )

408
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,468
Who said that?

409
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,269
Who talked while Kurt
was talking?

410
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:06,471
It was him.

411
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:07,873
He uttered something.

412
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,543
Why, I should've known.

413
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,477
Uh, I'm sorry I uttered.

414
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,413
You think you're funny,
don't you, bro?

415
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,749
You know what?

416
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:20,619
At Mondo Burger,
there are no comedians.

417
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,687
You mess with Kurt and
you go into the grinder.

418
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,956
Okay, now this grinder
of yours,

419
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,225
is it a real grinder

420
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:29,226
or is it some kind of
a metaphor?

421

That's it, you're gone!

I-I won't be funny
no more. See?

Wait, one second.

Oh, now, you about to push me
a little too far.

Yeah, extra crispy, please.

Excuse me.

Look, I ordered one Good Burger
with<i> nothing</i> on it.

445
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,264
That's what I gave you.

446
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,966
No, you gave me
a bun.

447
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,201
Just a bun.

448
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,104
Look, there's no meat in here.

449
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,073
But you said you
wanted nothing on it.

450
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,542
Yes, well, I expected
a meat patty!

451
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,076
Dude, a meat patty is something.

452
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,311
You said nothing.

453
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:21,680
Fizz, is a meat patty

454
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,481
something,
or nothing?

455
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,049
Uh... something?

456
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,116
I win!

457
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,418
All right, that rips it.

458
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,687
I am reporting your name
to the manager!

459
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,689
The manager already
knows my name.

460
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,125
Oh, I'll see you in hell!

461

Okay. See you there.

462

Such a nice guy;
I don't know why

463

he had to throw the
bread everywhere.

I mean, jeez.

465
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:47,572
One more Good Shake.

Good, good,
keep them coming.

00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:51,442
Um, dude, don't you think
you've had enough?

468
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:52,509
Hey...

469
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,912
Hey, you look familiar.

470
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,214
Don't I know you from somewhere?

471
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,982
Ever been to Australia?

472
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:58,583
No.

473
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,418
Me neither.

474
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,921
I could've sworn I seen
you someplace before.

475
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,256
Hey, I know.

476
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,692
Maybe I'm someone famous.

477
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,425
You know,
like a baseball player,

478
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,927
or a pretty nurse. Huh.

479
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,597
What? Man, what in the world
are you talking about?

480
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:13,831
Okay, okay, I give up.

481
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,233
Who am I?

482
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:18,569
I don't know who you are,
or where I know you from,

483
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,139
or why you think
you're an attractive nurse.

484
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,141
But I am sure I don't
want to know you

485
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,209
any longer.

486
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,343
Now please, go away.

487
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:26,678
I've had a very bad day.

488
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,746
What's wrong?

489
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,448
Were you bitten by a sheep?

490
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,749
What?!

491
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,784
Did you lose
your trousers?

492
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:33,986
No!

493
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,188
Look, you're an unusually
bad guesser,

494
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,223
so I'm going to go ahead
and tell you why I'm upset.

495
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:42,493
I got to come up with $1,900
to fix some jerk's car,

another $800
to fix my mother's car

497
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:46,597

That's funny,

for much of a thinker.

Oh, yeah, sure.

1059
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:37,287

1060
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,422
Good Burger...

1061

things that
are sticky...

1064
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,097
I'll bet
you don't have one real problem.

1065
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,733
Um, I got six toes
on my left foot.

1066
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,103
What kind of problems
do you have?

1067
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,938
 Other than the ones<i>
 you</i> cause? Lots.

1068
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:58,307
Most of them started
when I was a little kid.

1069
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:01,277
That's when my dad left me
and my mom.

1070
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:04,713
I must have lived in 15 places
since then.

1071
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:07,951
I remember the last time
I saw my Dad.

1072
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:09,351
I was seven years old,

1073
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:12,722
and for no reason at all,
he bought me this yo-yo.

1074
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:14,858
It was so cool.

1075
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:17,460
I mean, it wasn't
just an ordinary yo-yo.

1076
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,530
It had lights that lit up
when you yo-yoed it.

1077
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,168
Red lights on one side,
and blue lights on the other.

1078
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,403
And it made this funky,
whistling noise, too.

1079
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:28,606
Wow.

1080
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,540
That sounds
like quite a yo-yo.

1081
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:32,009
You-you still got it?

1082
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,809
No.

1083
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,146
After awhile,
it stopped lighting up.

1084
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,282
Then it quit making that funky
whistling noise.

1085
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:42,853
Then I guess
my mom just threw it away.

1086
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:47,990
You know...

1087
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:51,027
I don't even remember
what my dad looks like.

1088
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:55,197
I don't remember
what my dad looks like, either.

1089
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:58,935
But at least
I get to see him every day.

2306
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:23,963
Ooh-hoo, come on, Ed.

2307
01:28:23,963 --> 01:28:25,365
Huh.

2308
01:28:25,365 --> 01:28:27,568
So,<i> you</i> poured that stuff
in that meat, didn't you?

2309
01:28:27,568 --> 01:28:28,569
Huh, I had to.

2310
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:29,837
You<i> had</i> to?

2311
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,606
Sure. See, I knew
if I took the can,

2312
01:28:31,605 --> 01:28:34,140
there was a good chance
I'd get caught. Huh.

2313
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:36,042
Then I thought,
even if I did take

2314
01:28:36,042 --> 01:28:38,311
the triambythal to
the proper authorities,

2315
01:28:38,311 --> 01:28:41,047
huh, Kurt would hire some
high-powered attorneys

2316
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:42,716
who would dispute
any charges

2317
01:28:42,716 --> 01:28:44,717
brought against him
or Mondo Burger,

2318
01:28:44,717 --> 01:28:46,386
by manipulating
the legal system.

2319
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:48,554
And the way that
America's court system

2320
01:28:48,555 --> 01:28:50,124
is congested these days,

2321
01:28:50,123 --> 01:28:53,027
it would have taken months
to convict him of anything.

2322
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,427
So then I thought,

2323
01:28:54,427 --> 01:28:56,329
I'll take matters
into my own hands

2324
01:28:56,329 --> 01:28:58,064
and just pour
the triambythal

2325
01:28:58,064 --> 01:29:00,400
into the meat supply
and let Mondo Burger

2326
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,536
be a victim of
its own foul play.

2327
01:29:02,536 --> 01:29:03,938
Ha! Huh!

2328

Oh, wait-wait-
wait-wait.

2329

2330
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,411
Yeah, sure.

2331

Wait, y-you don't

2336

See...

2338
01:29:24,057 --> 01:29:25,225
Is it because I'm black?
