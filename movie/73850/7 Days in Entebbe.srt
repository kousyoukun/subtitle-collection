He wants to be there when
the prisoners are released.

we're coming,

they start to kill the men,
the women, the children.

The Israelis have surrendered.

977

They have not surrendered.

more time?

of the masses.

When your people
massacred them,

995
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:58,325
the ones who survived
had nothing.

996
01:05:58,327 --> 01:06:01,196
They brought their dead
to Palestine.

997
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:03,334
They brought
their shame and humiliation.

998

They did what was done to them
to us.

You are here because
you hate your country.
