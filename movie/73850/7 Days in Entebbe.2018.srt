PRIME MINISTER RABIN:<i>
If we don't have good schools,</i>

55
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:27,620
<i>a good health system...
if we don't invest</i>

56
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:31,891
in our own culture,
what are we fighting for?

57
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,726
We cannot allocate
all the taxpayers' money

58
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,127
to your ministry, Shimon.

59
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,764
The defense budget
is already 31% of the GDP.

60
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:41,700
A raise of ten percent
in four years.

61
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,003
In my personal assessment,

62
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,572
a ten-percent increase
in military spending

63
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:49,041
- is the minimum that we need.
- (murmurs of dissent)

64
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:52,711
Anything less would be
a dereliction of our duty.

65
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,080
Now, this is not about
a choice, gentlemen.

66
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,549
This is compulsory.

67
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,885
This is about the survival
of Israel.

68
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,024
As the Yom Kippur War proved,
our intelligence capabilities

69
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,926
are also lacking.

70
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,028
We don't have the assets
on the ground.

71
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,662
We need more agents.

72
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,665
We need to buy more influence.

73
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,501
The Russians
have massively increased

74
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:18,137
military aid to Egypt.

75
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,739
Syria is also re-arming.

76
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:23,008
(voice fading): There are
Russian military personnel

77
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,678
back in the Golan Heights.

78
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,080
It is not just tanks
and airplanes.

79
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,615
Also, capabilities are lacking.

80
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,750
If we are caught
off guard again,

81
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:35,488
the consequences
will be catastrophic.

82
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,890
In my assessment, Russia...

83
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,625
This is compulsory.

84
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:42,528
This is about the ten percent
that we need.

85
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,897
We cannot allocate money
to health and education

86
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,935
when we are being driven
into the sea by our enemies.

87

BOSE (over speakers):
You're required to hand over

88

evidence of your identity.

89

holding back any papers

Legally, it's a French problem.

101
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,706
It's their airliner
and mostly their citizens.

102
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,641
If it's a hijack,
we'll make sure

103
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:03,842
the press understands that.

104

I-I need to do
my pre-flight checks.

I need to check the wheels,
the brakes and the engine.

138

You should be taking care

You have my word, I won't.

00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:20,944
Plus, it's impossible to come
all the way across the lake

496
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,214
from Kenya
in rubber boats unnoticed.

497
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,816
This is not a drill, okay?

498
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,451
It's the real world.

499
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:31,355
Motta, why don't we send in
the commandos,

500
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:34,491
take the airport, and then wait
to hear from Amin?

501
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:38,662
Well...

502
00:36:38,695 --> 00:36:41,365
if you want to take control
of the airport,

503
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:43,500
you're gonna have to use
a much bigger force.

504
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,536
Could you run some numbers
for me?

505
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:48,672
I want to present
a plan tomorrow.

506
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:51,542
Also, call special forces
unit to base.

507
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:53,544
Of course, Defense Minister.

508
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:54,678
Thank you.

509
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,214
No problem.

510
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,690
I think I know why Rabin
wanted Motta here.

511
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:09,259
He wants to stop us
from coming up

512
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,463
with a viable military option.

513
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:16,767
That way, he doesn't have
to make a decision.

514
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,937
He wants to blame you
for this crisis.

515
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,674
That's politics.

516

(chuckling): You know,
I wish I could do that.

519
00:37:37,587 --> 00:37:40,024
There was a phone call.

520
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,660
They want you back
at base tomorrow.

521

It's not about that.

You know I have
no choice here, right?

524
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,538
Sarah, I have to go.
It's my job.

525

There's always a choice.

526

That's not true.

527
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,878
What choice
do those hostages have?

528
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,880
If you think you have no choice,

529
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,715
you're a hostage, too.

I was working in Israel,

No, I'm French. I, uh...

626

You are spy. (speaks Arabic)

He's French.

631
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:24,695
He is your friend?

632
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,864
- Yes. -Then you go
through there, too.

633
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,305
For this plan to succeed,

634
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,240
we need to use
a big enough force

635
00:44:37,273 --> 00:44:39,342
to seize control of the airport.

636
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:42,446
First, we use the commandos,
kill the terrorists,

637
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,080
secure the hostages.

638
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,850
Then we fly in reinforcements.

639
00:44:46,883 --> 00:44:50,754
Heavy weaponry,
at least 1,000 men.

640

You want to invade Uganda,
Shimon?

641
00:44:54,157 --> 00:44:58,195
Oh, we give it back to them
when we leave.

642
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,330
We cannot invade a country
that is a member

643
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:02,466
of the UN
and the African League.

644
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,769
And it's impossible to move
a force of that size

645
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:07,070
4,000 kilometers undetected.

646
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:08,905
SHIMON:
We have to act.

647
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:11,842
There can be no negotiations
with terrorists.

648
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,411
I'm talking to
the chief of staff, Shimon.

649

The soldier, not the politician.

650
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:20,050
I have to agree
with the prime minister.

651
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,252
RABIN: We need to find out
if Amin is helping them.

00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:24,821
You were in Uganda, right?
You dealt with him?

653
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:26,923
I trained his army, yes.

654
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:30,794
I'd like to assume he's not
gonna declare war on France.

655
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:33,797
Having said that,
the man is absolutely crazy.

656
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:37,167
He might have a dream,
some kind of a vision,

657
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,203
and anything can happen.

658
00:45:40,236 --> 00:45:42,906
I can try... call him.

659
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,276
If Amin is on
the terrorists' side,

660
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:48,278
we may have to negotiate.

661
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:53,049
SHIMON: Prime Minister, they
are asking for 52 terrorists.

662
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:55,551
Israel cannot capitulate.
It cannot.

663
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:57,521
They're going to start
killing the hostages

664
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,023
the day after tomorrow.

665
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:01,258
Call Amin.

666
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,993
I want to know where he stands.

667
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:09,966
They have moved
the Jews together

668
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:11,968
at the old terminal at Entebbe.

669
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:15,372
They have surrounded them
with high explosives.

670
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:19,376
They have TNT on the plane
and all around the building,

671
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,244
even on their bodies.

672
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:25,415
They said that they will commit
suicide with the hostages.

673
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:28,819
Tell your government
there is nothing I can do.

674
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,054
MOTTA: But, Your Excellency,
this is your country.

675
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:32,455
You have an opportunity

676
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:35,424
to go down in history
as a great man.

677
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,027
The man who saved these people.

678
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,229
This is a-a great
opportunity, sir,

679
00:46:39,262 --> 00:46:40,831
given to you by God.

680
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,933
AMIN: All the terrorists want
is for you

681
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,202
to send your prisoners here.

682
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,806
Don't listen to those from
the PFLP sitting beside you.

683
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,276
You are offending me,
old friend.

684
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:55,145
All I'm trying to do

685
00:46:55,178 --> 00:46:57,547
is make sure
the hostages are safe.

686
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,082
MOTTA:
I'm sorry, Your Excellency,

687
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:01,618
but please consider
what I'm saying.

688
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:05,120
Don't miss this opportunity

689
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:07,157
to show the people
who say bad things about you

690
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,425
what a great man you are.

691
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,527
Actually, I-I think this will

692
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,328
get you the Nobel Prize
for peace.

693
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,535
Uh, Y-Your Highness?

694
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,306
Y-Your Highness?

695
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,179
Why would the PFLP want us

696
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:31,014
to fly their prisoners
to Uganda?

697
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:34,251
I think that's Amin,
not the Palestinians.

698
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,486
He wants to be there when
the prisoners are released.

699
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,622
He wants to show the Soviets
and the Arabs

700
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,457
that he is with them now.

701
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,361
He wants their approval,
their support, their arms.

702
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,428
The $5 million.

703
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:48,431
If the Ugandans
are with the terrorists,

704
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,967
this operation
will have to be even bigger.

705
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,169
SHIMON:
I spoke to Kissinger.

706
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:55,972
He said it's better
if everybody dies

707
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:58,008
than we negotiate.

708
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,176
Yeah, well,
if it's not a French problem,

709
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:03,680
then it's even less
of an American problem, Shimon.

710
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:07,050
(sighs) Let's do
the only thing we can do.

711
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,052
No, wait. Please.

712
00:48:11,187 --> 00:48:12,589
Yitzhak.

713
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:17,594
Shimon, let me explain
the situation as it stands.

714
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:19,229
We have no intelligence.

715
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:21,331
We only know the hostages
are in the terminal.

716
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:22,632
Nothing else.

717
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:24,367
What if they moved
them around last night?

718
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,936
What if now
we have people sitting

719
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,713
in the middle of them
with guns and grenades?

720
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:29,372
As soon as they know
we're coming,

721
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:32,075
they start to kill the men,
the women, the children.

722
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,479
So they are selecting Jews,
and you want to negotiate.

723
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:38,581
(Rabin sighs)

724
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:40,650
Shimon...

725
00:48:40,683 --> 00:48:43,119
if we don't negotiate,
if we never negotiate,

726
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:45,121
if we're always at war,

727
00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:46,990
then we will make
our country a prison,

728
00:48:47,023 --> 00:48:49,960
and every one of our citizens
will be a prisoner.

729
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,095
Our enemies are our neighbors.

730
00:48:52,128 --> 00:48:54,064
We can't get away from them.

731
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,968
One day, we have to talk
and to make peace.

732
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,440
Thank you, gentlemen.

733
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:12,382
How did they know you were here?

734
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:13,717
He guessed.

735
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,719
The spirits warned my mother

736
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,721
I should never offend
the Israelis.

737
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:19,389
We should listen to my mother.

738
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:21,024
To your mother?

739
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:24,527
Release some of the hostages.

740
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,296
It will appease the French

741
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:28,298
and make things easier
at the airport.

818
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,470
I'm very worried about you.

819
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:13,376
These men bear no grudge
against you.

820
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:17,547
Only against your fascist
Israeli government.

821
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:22,418
But if your government
do not negotiate,

822
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:26,356
they will kill two children

823
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,458
every 24 hours.

824
00:55:35,531 --> 00:55:37,734
Starting with these two.

825
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:46,609
HANNA:
How can you do this?

826
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:49,145
Standing here
with your machine gun.

827
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:51,348
These are little children.

828
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:54,517
PASCO:
We have soldiers.

829
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,920
If you have to fight,
you fight our soldiers.

830
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,461
(quiet chatter)

831
00:56:07,963 --> 00:56:09,732
I don't want a coffee.

832
00:56:09,765 --> 00:56:11,933
Zeev, you have a phone call.

833
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:14,003
Just wish I could be there.

834
00:56:14,036 --> 00:56:16,506
SARAH:
You can't make it?

835
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,874
I got the part I wanted.

836
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,409
Hey, that's great.

837
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,411
I'm happy for you.

838
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,646
Will you be safe?

839
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:26,383
Don't want to talk about that.
(clears throat)

840
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,053
Have you been thinking of me?

841
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,991
No, I mean, you know, it...

842
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:41,164
Sarah, people you love,
sometimes...

843
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,700
thinking of them, it, um...

844
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:46,669
it doesn't help.

845
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:52,174
Yeah.

846
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,144
I know what you mean.

847
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:10,660
Have you been practicing
on your shooting range?

848
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:11,694
Yes.

849
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:14,063
Every day.

850
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:16,199
Good.

851
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,201
Who was that?

852
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,902
It was my girlfriend.

853
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:21,770
Is she in the military?

854
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:23,506
No, she's not.

855
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,944
If you want to be with her,

856
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,179
you need to get her
to join the army.

857
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:32,081
Otherwise, it's better
you leave her alone.

858
00:57:32,114 --> 00:57:33,649
What do you mean?

859
00:57:33,682 --> 00:57:35,718
I mean exactly what I said.

860
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,654
Trust me, I know.

861
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:42,225
DAVID BRINKLEY:<i>
The Palestinian hijackers</i>

862
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:46,028
released 48 of their hostage
airline passengers.

863
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:48,764
But they stood nervously
holding machine guns

864
00:57:48,797 --> 00:57:52,568
on the remaining 209
and threatened to kill them all

865
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,537
and to blow up
the French airliner

866
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,539
unless their demands are met.

867
00:57:56,572 --> 00:57:59,675
<i>The 48 passengers they let go
left for Paris,</i>

868
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:01,911
<i>where they arrived
a short time ago.</i>

869
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:04,212
<i>John Palmer was there
at the airport.</i>

870
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:06,916
JOHN PALMER:<i> The VIP lounge
here at Orly Airport</i>

871
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:09,051
<i>has been cordoned off by police,</i>

872
00:58:09,084 --> 00:58:11,020
<i>and the waiting room inside</i>

873
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:13,589
<i>crowded with many relatives

874
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:16,625
<i>waiting to greet
the newly released hostages.</i>

875
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,295
<i>Many of them, of course,
all of them on this flight,</i>

876
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:23,700
<i>consider themselves
very lucky indeed to be alive.</i>

877
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:31,774
Excuse me.

878
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:41,183
(clanking)

879
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:42,719
(sighs)

880
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:13,249
You must know how this looks
to the rest of the world.

881
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:14,283
Yeah.

882
00:59:14,316 --> 00:59:16,953
I know how this looks.

883
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,821
But it's not the reality.

884
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,627
I'm not responsible for
the actions of my compatriots.

885
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,995
You are repeating their actions.

886
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:28,363
No, I'm not.
I'm not the oppressor.

887
00:59:28,397 --> 00:59:30,308
I believe in the rights
of the Palestinian people.

888
00:59:30,332 --> 00:59:32,268
They have no homeland.

889
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:34,737
Have you ever seen
a Palestinian refugee camp?

890
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,806
Have you seen
how these people live?

891
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,607
Have you seen their children?

892
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,744
So, for them, you are willing

893
00:59:41,777 --> 00:59:44,314
to exterminate
those people down there?

894
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,751
We have to help them.

895
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:55,191
What do you do?
What's your job?

896
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,026
You're not a soldier.

897
00:59:59,294 --> 01:00:01,263
I'm a publisher.

898
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:03,732
I publish revolutionary texts.

899
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,969
Have you ever published
any books about plumbing?

900
01:00:07,736 --> 01:00:10,006
Not yet.
(chuckles softly)

901
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,009
Dignity...

902
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,412
is all people want.

903
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:18,815
Dignity comes when you're free.

904
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:25,855
Running water makes you free.

905
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,057
Toilet...

906
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,859
makes you free.

907
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:35,865
One plumber
is worth ten revolutionaries.

908
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,272
Do you ever think
you're wasting your life?

909
01:00:45,841 --> 01:00:47,810
No.

910
01:00:47,843 --> 01:00:49,345
Do you?

911
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:53,115
I'm an engineer.

912
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:54,450
I can make things.

913
01:00:54,483 --> 01:00:57,987
One engineer
is worth 50 revolutionaries.

914
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:04,160
(children chattering playfully)

915
01:01:32,521 --> 01:01:34,123
Jaber. What is this?

916
01:01:34,156 --> 01:01:35,958
A holiday camp now?

917
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,727
They are children, Halima.

918
01:01:41,897 --> 01:01:43,466
(squealing, shouting playfully)

919

MALE NEWSCASTER:<i>
The pressure on</i>

920
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:48,880
<i>the Israeli government
was tremendous,</i>

921
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:50,406
<i>especially from
within the country.</i>

922
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:52,341
<i>Relatives of
the Israeli hostages</i>

923

<i>with government
representatives this morning.</i>

925
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:58,514
<i>They didn't care that Israel
has a basic policy</i>

926
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:00,783
<i>of not dealing with terrorists.</i>

927
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:02,151
<i>Late in the morning,</i>

928
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:03,461
<i>they stormed

929
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:04,629
<i>overwhelming military police,</i>

930
01:02:04,653 --> 01:02:07,323
<i>in an effort to get

931
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,058
<i>and tell him what they thought.</i>

936
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:26,242
AMOS: The families
want the hostages released.

937
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,010
But as an Israeli politician,

938
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:31,480
you can't afford
to negotiate with terrorists.

939
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:33,215
That's right.

940
01:02:33,248 --> 01:02:34,950
That's what I've become.

941
01:02:34,983 --> 01:02:36,227

Prime Minister Rabin!

01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,498
We want to speak with
the prime minister.

944
01:02:40,522 --> 01:02:43,259
- Stop! -We want to speak
with the prime minister.

945
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,493
He owes us an explanation.

946
01:02:44,526 --> 01:02:46,495
We want to see
the prime minister.

947
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:48,230

01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:53,102
Everybody, calm down.

950
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:55,905
(clamoring continues)

951
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,209
We need an explanation!

952
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,164
Mr. Ambassador,
this is the prime minister.

953
01:03:22,197 --> 01:03:24,533
I would like you
to tell the French

954
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:28,370
that we're going to make
an offer to the terrorists.

955
01:03:28,403 --> 01:03:30,538
To everyone's surprise,
the Israelis today

956
01:03:30,572 --> 01:03:32,441
reversed their normal policy

957
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:35,144
and agreed to negotiate
with the hijackers.

958
01:03:35,177 --> 01:03:38,480
The hijackers put off their
deadline to 8:00 a.m. Sunday

959
01:03:38,513 --> 01:03:40,982
after Israel broke
its long-standing policy

960
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:42,418
and agreed to negotiate.

961
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,086
The difference of opinion
in Israel

962
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:46,222
is not over whether the
hostages should be released,

963
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,457
but over whether releasing
terrorists from jail here

964
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,392
is too high a price
to pay for it.

965
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:53,562
<i>Tonight, a special series
of prayers began</i>

966
01:03:53,595 --> 01:03:56,064
<i>at the Western Wall
and at most synagogues.</i>

967
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,467
<i>Prayers which expressed
the hope that the government</i>

968
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,569
<i>made the right decision
on the negotiations</i>

969
01:04:00,602 --> 01:04:02,437
<i>and that the Israeli
and Jewish hostages</i>

970
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,474
<i>will indeed come out
of Uganda safely.</i>

971
01:04:05,507 --> 01:04:07,944
(insects chirping)

972
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:59,228
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

973
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:00,963
You left your gun
lying on the wall.

974
01:05:00,996 --> 01:05:02,665
One of the Jews
could have picked it up.

975
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,566
Relax, man.
The Israelis have surrendered.

976
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:06,568
They have not surrendered.

977
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:08,270
What if this is a trick?

978
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:10,038
What if they are buying
more time?

979
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,508
- We have to be ready.
- Okay, okay.

980
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,046
Why are you here?

981
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,651
I want to throw bombs

982
01:05:22,684 --> 01:05:25,054
into the consciousness
of the masses.

983
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:28,257
And what if you have to throw
a real bomb, my friend?

984
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:29,959
Have you killed?

985
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:32,228
You think you can do it?

986
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:37,031
You choose to pick up arms
and fight.

987
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:39,335
You choose to come here.

988
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:42,337
You could have
a nice life in Europe.

989
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,540
I wish I had your life.

990
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,642
I would not pick up a gun.

991
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:49,078
Only people with nothing
understand.

992
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,013
The Jews understand.

993
01:05:52,514 --> 01:05:54,717
When your people massacred them,

994
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,120
the ones who survived
had nothing.

995
01:05:58,153 --> 01:06:00,990
They brought their dead
to Palestine.

996
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,159
They brought
their shame and humiliation.

997
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:08,697
They did what was done to them
to us.

998
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:12,234
But I didn't do it to them.

999
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:13,970
You did it to them.

1000
01:06:16,538 --> 01:06:19,375
You are here because
you hate your country.

1001
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,711
I'm here because I love mine.

1002
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,049
Are you ready to kill?

1003
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,319
Are you ready to die?

1004
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:36,592
If this negotiation is a trick,

1005
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,561
we start killing immediately.

1006
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,432
Immediately.

1007
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:05,054
BENNY: We can fly down
over the Red Sea

1008
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,289
at low level
to avoid enemy radar.

1009
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:10,225
When the last plane
leaves at 23:45,

1010
01:07:10,258 --> 01:07:13,796
the runway lights stay on
for 15 minutes.

1011
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:17,366
- That's our window.
- SHIMON: Mm.

1012
01:07:17,399 --> 01:07:19,801
The Ugandan soldiers
have nothing at stake.

1013
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,603
Once they see us
when we get there,

1014
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:23,481
- they will start running.
- MOTTA: Just a second there.

1015
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:26,208
You said you didn't have
enough fuel, right?

1016
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:27,810
- (tapping table)
- This is crucial.

1017
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,345
Yeah, we're gonna have
to refuel on our way back home.

1018
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:33,382
Sir, Kenya will be
the best place to do it.

1019
01:07:33,415 --> 01:07:34,650
Motta.

1020
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,819
This operation
is not gonna succeed.

1021
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,555
This is a charade, okay?
This... it's fantasy.

1022
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,590
The Germans separated the Jews.

1023
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:46,361
Selection, Motta.

1024
01:07:46,394 --> 01:07:48,629
We can't just sit here,
do nothing.

1025
01:07:48,663 --> 01:07:50,833
These are my men.

1026
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:54,303
If they die,
it's my responsibility.

1027
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,738
No, Motta.
They are Israeli soldiers.

1028
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:59,108
It's the prime minister's
responsibility.

1029
01:08:03,678 --> 01:08:06,549
Are you going to back me up
on this, Motta?

1030
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:21,097
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1031
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,899
They're negotiating.

1032
01:08:23,932 --> 01:08:25,867
You think they're gonna
call you back?

1033
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,403
I don't think the operation's
gonna be approved, but...

1034
01:08:28,435 --> 01:08:30,371
we have to practice.

1035
01:08:31,473 --> 01:08:33,442
Why does it have to be you?

1036
01:08:33,475 --> 01:08:35,677
How many times
are we gonna talk about this?

1037
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,147
We can't just be at war
all the time.

1038
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,916
You're not at war all the time.
You're a dancer.

1039
01:08:40,948 --> 01:08:43,719
I fight so you can dance.

1040
01:08:45,886 --> 01:08:49,258
What if I stop dancing?

1041
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:57,165
(phone ringing)

1042
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:03,805
Yeah.

1043
01:09:06,774 --> 01:09:07,942
ALI:
Calm down.

1044
01:09:07,975 --> 01:09:09,478
Quiet, quiet.

1045
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:11,213
Listen.

1046
01:09:11,246 --> 01:09:14,716
The Israeli government
has agreed to negotiate.

1047
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:18,786
The deadline has been extended
until 11:00 a.m. on Sunday.

1048
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:20,354
(applause)

1049
01:09:20,388 --> 01:09:22,323
As a gesture of goodwill,

1050
01:09:22,357 --> 01:09:24,426
we have released
all French nationals.

1051
01:09:24,459 --> 01:09:26,361
And then,
once our comrades are freed,

1052
01:09:26,394 --> 01:09:28,397
you will all be free.

1053
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,399
You can go back
to the big room now.

1054
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,934
- (applause)
- Come on.

1055
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,836
Come on.

1056
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,839
Israel never negotiates.

1057
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:39,842
- BOSE: Come on, everyone.
- No.

1058
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:02,264
(woman continues crying)

1059
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:17,379
Where do you think
you are going?

1060
01:10:17,412 --> 01:10:19,615
This is a letter for my wife.

1061
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,724
Hurry up.

1062
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,366
<i>- Oui, monsieur.
- Merci.</i>

1063
01:10:47,442 --> 01:10:49,411
(quiet chatter)

1064
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,524
(speaking French)

1065
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:16,538
(quiet conversation in French)

1066
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,743
Here.

1067
01:11:21,776 --> 01:11:23,879
- I'll take care of it.
- (groans)

1068
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:26,915
(coughs)

1069
01:11:44,432 --> 01:11:45,934
Yeah.

1070
01:11:57,145 --> 01:11:59,381
(engine idling)

1071
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:03,752
(engine shuts off)

1072
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,021
What is this?

1073
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:08,390
Huh? It's supposed to be black.

1074
01:12:08,423 --> 01:12:10,492
- Hey, it's the only color
they had. -Yeah.

1075
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,433
You gotta be kidding me, right?

1076
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:20,869
<i>I want the best shooters
of the unit</i>

1077
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:22,871
<i>inside the Mercedes with me.</i>

1078
01:12:22,904 --> 01:12:24,773
<i>We're gonna raid the terminal
in five teams.</i>

1079
01:12:24,806 --> 01:12:26,775
Joshua will lead the first team.

1080
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:28,110
Muki, second team.

1081
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,445
Zeev, third team.

1082
01:12:30,478 --> 01:12:33,148
Amos and Erez, fourth and fifth.

1083
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:35,983
We're gonna land here
in the new terminal runway,

1084
01:12:36,017 --> 01:12:37,853
all the way to here.

1085
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:40,422
We're gonna go out in one
Mercedes and two Land Rovers.

1086
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:42,557
We're gonna drive all the way
to the old terminal.

1087
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,126
We're gonna park
under the tower,

1088
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,594
hidden from sniper fire.

1089
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,096
Surprise and speed is the key.

1090
01:12:48,129 --> 01:12:52,033
<i>And if the prime minister
approves this mission,</i>

1091
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:53,769
<i>we will go.</i>

1092
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,170
RABIN:<i>
The terrorists only need</i>

1093
01:12:55,203 --> 01:12:56,805
<i>a few minutes to kill everyone.</i>

1094
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:59,107
What if the first plane
is identified and attacked

1095
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:02,544
before the rest of the force
has time to land and deploy?

1096
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:04,946
They won't stand a chance.

1097
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:07,182
And if it fails,

1098
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:10,685
the blow to the IDF,
to Israel, will be...

1099
01:13:10,718 --> 01:13:12,488
catastrophic.

1100
01:13:14,055 --> 01:13:16,591
Anyway, I am bound
by the Cabinet's decision.

1101
01:13:16,624 --> 01:13:19,928
Yitzhak, you are the Cabinet.

1102
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:25,667
Rehearse it. (sighs)

1103
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:28,036

MAN:
I didn't see the signal.

1116
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:40,835
Give me the megaphone.

1117

You're staying first.

1121
01:16:00,955 --> 01:16:02,123
Motta.

1122
01:16:02,156 --> 01:16:03,992
(takes deep breath)

1123
01:16:04,025 --> 01:16:06,061
I'm going to recommend
the operation

1124
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,930
to Rabin and the Cabinet
if he says it's okay.

1125
01:16:08,963 --> 01:16:10,799
Can you do it, Yoni?

1126
01:16:18,339 --> 01:16:19,941
RABIN (over phone):
Is there anything

1127
01:16:19,974 --> 01:16:21,285
blocking their path
to the hostages?

1128
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:22,844
EHUD:
No, sir.

1129
01:16:22,877 --> 01:16:26,982
There are no obstacles
around the terminal.

1130
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:30,051
Nothing to stop our men
reaching the hostages.

1131
01:16:30,084 --> 01:16:32,721
I want the photograph to reach
the men before they leave.

1132
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,289
Thank you.

1133
01:16:37,258 --> 01:16:40,128
There's nothing to stop
the operation from proceeding.

1134
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:42,163
So now you have
to make a decision.

1135
01:16:42,196 --> 01:16:43,798
If I was still a general,

1136
01:16:43,831 --> 01:16:45,867
I would never approve
this mission.

1137
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,370
It's a huge risk.

1138
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:52,140
YONI: There will be casualties.
You all know that.

1139
01:16:52,173 --> 01:16:56,143
What we cannot doubt
