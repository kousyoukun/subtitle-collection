1947年 以色列國被聯合國認可

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,490
以色列國

5
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,540
巴勒斯坦人立刻開始為了他們的故土而抗爭

6
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,890
全球各地的左翼革命團體加入了他們

7
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,310
他們一起對以色列平民展開襲擊行動

8
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,570
他們自稱 自由戰士

9
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,710
以色列人稱他們為 恐怖分子

10
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:16,700
恩德培行動

1976年 6月27日 星期日

14
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,740
請快點通過
Come. Come through please.

15
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,400
雅典 希臘

16
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
快去那邊
Move! Over there!

17
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,060
你們聽好了 這是劫機
Everybody, this is a hijack situation!

18
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,690
都別動
Nobody move!

19
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,060
-都別動 -如果你們都乖乖坐好
- Nobody move! - If you all stay in your seats

20
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,030
不亂動 那麼沒人會受傷
and do not move, no one will be harmed.

21
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,670
但要是有人搞小動作 我就引爆這枚手榴彈
But if anybody tries anything, I will throw this grenade.

22
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,030
都別動 乖乖坐好
Nobody move! Everyone stay in your seat!

23
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,540
別動 我手上有炸彈
Don't move! I have a bomb!

24
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,880
後面在吵什麼呢

25
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,810
可能是誰掉了根煙吧 我去看看

26
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,810
坐下
Sit down!

27
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,180
坐下
Sit! Sit!

28
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,620
我們已經佔領了座艙
We've got the cabin under control.

29
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,290
我們四個人
It's four of us.

30
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,720
我們有武器和炸彈
We've got weapons and bombs.

31
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,590
如果你敢耍小花樣 你的小命就不保了
If you try anything, you will die.

32
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,860
39 你那控制住沒有
Comrade 39, is the cabin secured?

33
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,260
-控制住了 -都給我坐好
- Cabin secured. - Stay in your seats,

34
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,000
什麼都別做
and nobody try anything.

35
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,830
你們都快去後艙坐著 快點
Everyone in here, get into the back cabin now. Move!

36
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,170
什麼都別帶 快走
Take nothing with you. Move, move!

37
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,870
你們誰是機長
Who's the captain?

38
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,810
-我 -你們倆出去
- I am. - You two, out.

39
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,580
我是隨機工程師 我得待在這
I'm the flight engineer. I'm-I'm needed here.

40
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,980
你 起來走人
You, up.

41
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,790
都快走
Move! Hurry, hurry!

42
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,990
-快點 -把包放下 走

44
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,320
你也是
And you, too.

45
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,690
好 好 好
Okay, okay, okay.

46
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,930
快點
Faster! Come on!

47
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,570
媽咪 我想上廁所

48
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,790
忍著

49
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,650
如果我們沒有幾所好學校
If we don't have good schools,

50
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,820
沒有完善的醫保體系 如果我們
a good health system... if we don't invest

51
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,090
不投資我們自己的文化產業 那我們是在為什麼拚搏呢
in our own culture, what are we fighting for?

52
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,930
我們不能把納稅人的錢
We cannot allocate all the taxpayers' money

53
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,330
都投入到你的部門 西蒙
to your ministry, Shimon.

54
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,970
國防部的預算已經佔了GDP的百分之三十一了
The defense budget is already 31% of the GDP.

55
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,900
四年就漲了百分之十
A raise of ten percent in four years.

56
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,200
就我個人看來
In my personal assessment,

57
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,770
在軍隊花銷上增長百分之十
a ten-percent increase in military spending

58
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,240
是我們能接受的底線了
is the minimum that we need.

59
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,910
再低那可就是我們的失職了
Anything less would be a dereliction of our duty.

60
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,280
先生們 這可不是我們願不願意的問題
Now, this is not about a choice, gentlemen.

61
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,750
這是必須要做的事情
This is compulsory.

62
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,060
這關乎到以色列的存亡
This is about the survival of Israel.

63
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,230
就像贖罪日戰爭證明的那樣
As the Yom Kippur War proved, our intelligence capabilities

64
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,130
我們的情報水平也很低
are also lacking.

65
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,230
我們沒有多少陸地財產
We don't have the assets on the ground.

66
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,860
我們需要更多的特工
We need more agents.

67
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,870
我們得靠錢來換來影響力
We need to buy more influence.

68
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,700
俄羅斯已經大大增加了
The Russians have massively increased

69
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,340
對埃及的軍事援助
military aid to Egypt.

70
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,940
敘利亞也在準備重新武裝
Syria is also re-arming.

71
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,210
戈蘭高地那
There are Russian military personnel

72
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,690
從特拉維夫至巴黎的
法航139
在雅典中途停留時被劫機

73
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,880
也有俄羅斯駐紮的軍隊
back in the Golan Heights.

74
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,280
還不只是坦克和飛機的問題
It is not just tanks and airplanes.

75
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,820
我們的能力也實在欠缺
Also, capabilities are lacking.

76
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,950
如果我們又被人看到防守不足
If we are caught off guard again,

77
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,690
結果可是災難性的
the consequences will be catastrophic.

78
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:42,250
飛機上有多少以色列人
劫機犯有幾個人
他們要去哪

79
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,090
在我看來 俄羅斯...
In my assessment, Russia...

80
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,830
這是必須要做的
This is compulsory.

81
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,730
這關乎於我們需要的那百分之十軍隊開銷增長
This is about the ten percent that we need.

82
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,100
當我們被敵人追著屁股跑的時候
We cannot allocate money to health and education

83
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,110
我們不能把錢分配到醫療和教育上
when we are being driven into the sea by our enemies.

84
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,710
你們必須把所有
You're required to hand over

85
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,710
能證明你們身份的東西交出來
all documents that give evidence of your identity.

86
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,010
如果誰敢藏著掖著點什麼
Anyone who is caught holding back any papers

87
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,350
我們可不會對他手下留情
will be punished without mercy.

88
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,980
所有人都快點
Come on, everyone, give me

89
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,380
把你們的護照和身份證交出來
your passport and I.D. card, too.

90
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,860
護照 護照
Passport. Passport.

91
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,100
護照 身份證
Passport. I.D.

92
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,870
快把你的身份證也給我
Come on, give me your I.D. card, too.

93
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,350

護照
Passport.

95
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,990
}總理辦公室

96
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,900
飛機上共有239名乘客
There are 239 passengers on board.

97
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,400
83個是以色利人
83 are Israeli.

98
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
從法律上講 這是法國人的問題
Legally, it's a French problem.

99
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,910
這是他們的客機 大部分也都是法國人
It's their airliner and mostly their citizens.

100
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,840
如果真發生了劫機 我們得保證
If it's a hijack, we'll make sure

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,040
媒體瞭解到那個情況
the press understands that.

102
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,210
我可以打電話給編輯們
I can call the editors.

103
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,510
就是劫機
It's a hijack.

104
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,380
他們會飛到這挑戰我們
They'll fly back here to challenge us.

105
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,450
總是如此
They always do.

106
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,890
阿莫斯 總理啊...
Amos, Prime Minister...

107
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,460
這就是我們的問題
this is our problem.

108
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,900
你的意思是這是我的問題咯 西蒙
You mean it's my problem, Shimon?

109
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,360
媽咪 我真的想上廁所

110
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,950
-呃... -坐下
- Uh... - Sit down.

-不是 我... -坐下
- No, excuse me, but... - Sit down.

112
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,950
我女兒必須得上趟廁所
My daughter really needs to go to the bathroom.

113
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,030
你啊
You?

114
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,190
恩
Yeah.

115

你的紐扣開了
Your blouse is open.

120
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,160
別想著弄壞起落架
Don't try and break the undercarriage.

121
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,060
要不我們就一起去死
If you do, we'll die together.

122
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,900
別擔心 我會平穩著陸的

好樣的 機長
Good, Captain.

班加西 利比亞

127
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,660
怎麼要花這麼久
Why is this taking so long?

128
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,400
除非你告訴我我們要飛到哪
Unless you tell me where we're going,

129
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,630
否則我得要五六桶才夠
I'm going to need five or six of these.

130
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,500
好
Okay.

131
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,670
回飛機裡去
Get back inside the plane.

132
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,440
如果你想我們能順利、安全地起飛
If you want to fly on and if you want to be safe,

133
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,170
我得做一下飛前檢查
I-I need to do my pre-flight checks.

134
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,280
我得檢查下輪胎 制動器 和引擎
I need to check the wheels, the brakes and the engine.

135
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,080
你得去關心下飛機裡那些人
You should be taking care of those people inside.

136
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,120
他們都待五個多小時了
They've been on this plane five hours now.

They need food and drinks.

138

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,540
別多管閑事
Do your job.

145
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,190
法蘭克福 德國
六個月前

146
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,340
賈貝爾
Jaber.

147
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,740
-布麗吉特 這是胡安·帕布洛 -你好
- Brigitte, Juan Pablo. - Hello.

148
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,710
打劫飛機？
Hijacking a plane?

149
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,380
這是一次很重要的行動
That is a serious step.

150
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,190
我們有什麼任務嗎
What's in it for us?

151
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,090
聽聽賈貝爾怎麼說
Let's just see what Jaber has to say.

152
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,090
請坐
Sit.

153
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,630
你們這次行動壓力重重
Your movement is under pressure.

154
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,100
你們的後援力量在減弱
Your support is fading.

155
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,270
許多隊友也進了監獄
Many of your colleagues are in jail.

156
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,780
但這次的行動將會激勵一批新的追隨者
An action like this can inspire a new generation to follow you.

157
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,610
巴勒斯坦人民解放組織將要求釋放
The PFLP will call for the release

158
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,550
被捕的五十名巴勒斯坦犯人
of 50 Palestinian prisoners.

159
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,780
我們也可以趁機要求釋放我們的同伴
We could also demand the release of some of our friends.

160
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,490
如果我們完成這次任務 我們就可以得到我們想要的一切
If we do this, we can demand anything we want.

161
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,420
我們可以要求釋放烏爾麗克·邁因霍夫嗎
We can demand that Ulrike Meinhof is on the list?

162
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
他們不會釋放烏爾麗克的
They will never release Ulrike.

163
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,360
就像我說的那樣
Like I said,

164
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,430
如果我們順利完成這次任務
if we do this right,

165
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,030
他們就不得不滿足我們的全部要求
they have to do whatever we want.

166
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,760
也門

167
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,260
巴勒斯坦人民解放組織

168
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,490
瞄準
Aim!

169
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,720
射擊
Fire!

170
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,330
博斯
Bose!

171
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,100
我有話和你說
We need to talk.

172
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,240
烏爾麗剋死了
Ulrike Meinhof is dead.

173
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,110
她自殺了
She killed herself.

174
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,280
你的行動快結束了
Your movement is dying.

175
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,720
她剪掉了她的頭髮
She cut her hair.

176
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,120
不僅僅如此 她放棄了一切
No, she quit.

177
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,360
這起事件引出了一個問題
And that poses a problem.

178
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,300
什麼問題
Which problem?

179
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,500
他的父親和母親
His father and his mother.

180
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,100
妹妹和妻子以及他們的孩子
His sister and his wife, and their children.

181
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
當時他們全在黎巴嫩的難民營裡
They were all in a camp in Lebanon.

182
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,700
以色列突襲了難民營
The Israelis raided it.

183
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,270
殺死了裡面的人 炸毀了房屋
Killed people, dynamited the houses.

184
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,870
他們試圖逃跑
They tried to escape.

185
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
他們鑽進一輛車子裡 一個以色列士兵開著坦克撞了上來
They were in a car. An Israeli tank drove over it.

186
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,480
他們就全死了
All of them died.

187
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,450
這就是我所知道的為什麼他投入這次復仇行動的原因
That's how I know that he's committed.

188
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,880
現在你的好朋友死了
How do I know that you're committed

189
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,390
你又是為什麼加入呢
now your comrades are dead?

190
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,560
她不會上吊自殺的
She would never hang herself.

191
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,360
她是被以色列派人謀殺的
She was murdered by the state.

192
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,200
如果我們回到德國 我們也會被謀殺的
And if we return to Germany, we will be murdered, too.

193
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,570
現在最為關鍵的是 我們得繼續完成這次行動
It's all the more important that we continue.

194
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,670
-為了烏爾麗克 -也為了你失去的家人
- For Ulrike. - And for your family.

195
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,310
賈貝爾將在機場聽從指揮
At the airport, Jaber will be in command.

196
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,880
我將留在坎帕拉 和阿明總統保持聯絡
I will stay in Kampala and liaise with President Amin.

197
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
烏干達部隊將監控
Ugandans will control the perimeter

198
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,280
機場和建築周邊的情況
of the airfield and the building.

199
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,850
你們全部待在裡面
You will all stay inside.

200
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,520
在這種情況下 你們務必得小心
You must be careful in these situations.

201
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,460
而且要和乘客之間保持距離
You must keep your distance from the passengers.

202
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,860
任何的惻隱之心將會十分危險
Emotional attachment can be really dangerous.

203
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,600
尤其是對女人
Particularly for women.

204
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,770
我是一個堅決的革命者
I am a revolutionary.

205
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,550
您要喝點水嗎
Would you like some water?

206
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,790
您要喝點水嗎
Would you like some water?

207
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,230
您要給孩子們喝點水嗎
Would you like some water for the kids?

208
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,890
您要喝點水嗎
Would you like some water?

209
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,960
我感覺不舒服
I don't feel well.

210
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,570
你需要什麼嗎
What do you need?

211
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,300
我…我懷孕了
I-I'm pregnant.

212
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,240
我感覺我好像流產了
I think I'm having a miscarriage.

213
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,740
-好的 我馬上去幫你找位醫生 好嗎 -好
- Okay, I'm going to try to find you a doctor, okay? - Yeah.

214
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,610
小姐 她身體不舒服
Miss? She doesn't feel well.

215
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,610
她急需一位醫生
She really needs to see a doctor.

216
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,880
怎麼回事
What is the problem?

217
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,480
她感覺她好像流產了
She thinks she's losing her baby.

218
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,850
也太容易了點 對吧

219
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,920
她可不敢

220
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,420
呃 女士 我是護士
Uh, miss, I'm a nurse.

221
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,730
-或許我可以幫上忙 -你在那別動
- Maybe I can help. - You can wait.

222
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,300
幾個月了
Which month?

223
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,240
兩…兩個月
Two... two months.

224
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,570
你來自哪裡
Where you from?

225
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,170
英格蘭
England.

226
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,450
我們會叫救護車的
We will call an ambulance.

227
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,320
我們不想傷害任何人
We don't want to hurt anyone.

228
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,990
因為我們是人道主義者
We're humanitarians.

229
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,220
跟我來
Come with me.

230
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,820
他要去哪

231
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,150
我不知道

232
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,400
她在騙你
She's fooling you.

233
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,910
還是有點同情心比較好 兄弟
It's better to show mercy, comrade.

234
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,950
我要流產了
I'm losing my baby.

235
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,320
祝你好運
Good luck.

236
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,510
-不准用無線電 -我們必須
- No radio. - We have to speak

237
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,710
得和航空交通管理人員通話才能獲得起飛許可
to air traffic control for clearance.

238
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,080
跑道上沒有其他飛機 他們知道我們要離開
The runway's empty. They know we're leaving.

239
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,710
-放下它 -我們需要知道我們……
- Just take off. - We need to know we're...

240
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,710
我讓你放下
Take off!

241
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,420
啟動引擎
Set thrust.

242
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,690
啟動完畢
Set.

243
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,900
利比亞人給飛機加滿燃料 再次起飛了
The Libyans refueled them and let them take off again.

244
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,600
卡扎菲也不想這件事成為他的絆腳石
Gaddafi doesn't want this to be his problem, either.

245
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,470
他們加了多少燃料
How much fuel?

246
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,380
至少能飛五個小時
At least five hours.

247
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,810
特維拉夫已在監控範圍內
Tel Aviv is in range.

248
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,680
他們將在本·古裡安機場著陸
They'll land at Ben Gurion.

249
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,480
他們想讓全世界見證他們的行動
They want the world to watch.

250
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,120
還有一件事
There is one other thing.

251
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,550
他們放走了一名乘客
They released a passenger.

252
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,060
飛機上有兩個是阿拉伯人和
Uh, there were two Arabs.

253
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,590
巴勒斯坦人
Palestinians, I think.

254
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,990
和兩名德國人
And two Germans.

255
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,460
一男一女
A man and a woman.

256
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,970
為什麼他們會放你離開
Why did they let you off the plane?

257
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,500
我對他們撒謊了
I lied.

258
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
我告訴他們我懷孕了
I told them I was pregnant.

259
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,910
那他們有說他們接下來要去哪裡嗎
Did they say where they are going?

260
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,570
這整個行動毫無意義
This whole operation is nonsense.

261
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,640
我們從沒有提及過要去烏干達
We never talked about going to Uganda.

262
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,110
伊迪·阿明……他絕對是瘋了
Idi Amin... he's crazy.

263
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,650
他不僅"吃人"
He eats people.

264
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,780
還拿他們去餵鱷魚
He feeds them to the crocodiles.

265
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,720
我們把我們的命交給了一個瘋子
We're putting our lives in the hands of a lunatic.

266
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,090
一旦我們到達烏干達 我們就安全了
Once we get to Uganda, we are safe.

267
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,020
以色列政府沒有選擇
The Israelis have no choice.

268
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,890
他們必須得妥協
They have to negotiate.

269
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,600
因為這是將死之局
It's checkmate.

270
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,800
如果他們不願意談判怎麼辦
And what happens if they don't negotiate?

271
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,000
他們……
They...

272
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,070
他們……
They...

273
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,050
他們沒得選
They have to.

274
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,950
否則我們就殺了人質
Or we kill the hostages.

275
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,780
好吧
Yes.

276
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,750
你將不得不去殺人
You will have to kill people.

277
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,630
德國人殺死猶太人……你想過這個嗎
Germans killing Jews... have you thought about that?

278
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,160
烏爾麗克·邁因霍夫因我而死
Ulrike Meinhof is dead because of me.

279
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,200
-並不是這樣的 -事實就是如此
- That is not true. - It's true.

280
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,470
我相信了一個本不該信任的人
I trusted someone I shouldn't have,

281
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,440
導致她被逮捕 然後她現在死了
and she was arrested, and now she is dead.

282
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,680
如果你還有遲疑的話……
If you're having doubts...

283
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,620
你應該離開
you should leave.

284
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,460
你捨得我離開嗎
Do you want me to leave?

285
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,580
恩德培 烏干達

286
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,050
歡迎來到烏干達 恩德培市
Welcome to Entebbe, Uganda.

287
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,960
我至今還沒有
I haven't had the time up until now

288
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,290
對劫持這架法國航空飛機
to explain the reasons

289
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,860
作出解釋
for hijacking an Air France plane.

290
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,990
儘管對法國的
Despite the belief of many

291
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,030
親阿拉伯政策抱有很大希望
that France has a pro-Arab policy,

292
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,200
但法國仍是加入巴勒斯坦敵軍的
it is one of the first countries

293
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,670
第一批國家之一
in the rank of Palestinian enemies.

294
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,070
它曾與摩薩德情報局合作
France has cooperated with Mossad.

295
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,140
還向以色列出售飛機
France has sold planes to Israel.

296
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,810
同時法國還在以色列製造原子彈上提供幫助
France has given Israel help in building atom bombs.

297
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,090
巴勒斯坦沒有原子彈 沒有軍隊 也沒有武器
Palestine has no atom bombs, no army and no weapons.

298
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,920
所以巴勒斯坦人民解放組織
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine

299
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,890
必須得利用其他手段，
must utilize other means

300
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,760
去引起世界對巴勒斯坦人民
to focus the attention of the world

301
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,700
艱苦掙扎的現狀的關註
on the Palestinian people's struggle.

302
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,000
我們將呼籲全世界的革命運動
We call upon revolutionary movements everywhere

303
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,030
聯合起來去對抗以色列
to unite against Israel,

304
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,340
這個法西斯暴政的 猶太復國者的和種族歧視的民族
a fascist, Zionist and racist state.

305
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,210
慘無人道地剝削
Israel has exploited

306
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,340
人民的
the humanistic sentiments of its people

307
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,340
人道主義精神
to inhuman ends.

308
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,010
她完全是納粹主義的繼承者
She's the heir of Nazism.

309
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,820
請你保持冷靜
I would ask that you remain calm.

310
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,090
我們不會傷害你的
We will not do you any harm.

311
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,820
我們不是殺手
We are not assassins.

312
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,960
我們不想進行一場毫無意義的屠殺
And we do not want to commit a pointless massacre.

313
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,130
你們今晚會在飛機上度過
You will spend tonight on the plane.

314
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,870
明天我們就到航站樓
Tomorrow, we move to the terminal.

315
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,140
我知道你們有很多航空公司的選擇
We know you have a choice of airlines.

316
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,340
多謝你們選擇法國航空
Thank you for flying Air France.

317
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,770
期待與你們很快再次相見
We hope to see you again very soon.

318
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,720
現在你們知道
Now you know how the mind

319
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,220
一個瘋狂的德國革命派的大腦是怎麼運作的了
of a crazy German revolutionary works.

320
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,620
機長
Captain.

321
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,660
打開門
Open the door.

322
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,060
-回去 -小心臺階
- Get back. - Mind the step.

323
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,130
這是降落在這個機場最大的飛機
This is the biggest plane this airport has ever seen.

324
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
博尼 你應該來看看聽你講話後
Boni, you should see the faces

325
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,200
這些乘客的臉色
of the passengers after your speech.

326
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,410
怎麼了
What?

327
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,040
他們很害怕
They are terrified.

328
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,240
-你說了什麼 -你不會想知道的
- What did he say? - You don't want to know.

329
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,880
-嘿 -嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

330
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,160
第二日

331
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,580
1976年 6月28日 星期一

332
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,400
歡迎來到烏干達
Welcome to Uganda.

333
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,470
我是阿爾-哈吉閣下
I am His Excellency al-Hajji

334
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,740
元帥、伊迪·阿明·達達博士
Field Marshal Doctor Idi Amin Dada,

335
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,500
英國維多利亞十字勛章的持有人

還有DSO、CMV、MC勛章

我是非洲的英雄
I am the hero of Africa.

341
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,420
我也是你們的英雄
And I am your hero.

342
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,460
我們會滿足你們的所有需求
We will take care of your every need.

343
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,990
我們也非常希望你們會享受

344
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,760
待在在我們這個美麗的國家

345
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,900
所有事情都會被照料到
And everything will be taken care of.

346
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,100
你們會得到很好的照顧
You are in good hands.

347
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,810
請 請 請進
Please, please, step inside.

348
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,980
非常感謝
Thank you very much.

349
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,410
來吧
Come on.

350
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,700
希望他們能儘快開始談判

351
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,820
是啊
Yeah.

352
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,460
我去跟他談談

353
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,030
我們做到了
We did it.

354
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,400
做的不錯 做的不錯
Well done. Well done.

355
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,030
我們什麼時候開始談判
When do we start to negotiate?

356
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,060
放輕鬆 同志
Relax, comrade.

357
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,200
你做得很好
You've done a good job.

358
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,370
現在輪到我們了
It's up to us now.

359
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,370
而且我們很瞭解以色列人
And we know the Israelis very well.

360
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,940
我們知道他們怎麼思考
We know how they think,

361
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,570
他們怎麼行動 怎麼工作
how they operate, how they work.

362
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,110
我們將著手談判工作
We will handle the negotiations.

363
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,940
如果你有任何問題的話和賈貝爾談 賈貝爾
If you have any problems, just talk to Jaber. Jaber.

364
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,980
你的任務是看緊這些乘客
Your job is to watch the passengers.

365
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,420
你們兩個
Both of you.

366
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,570
4000千米
4,000 kilometers.

367
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,540
從來沒有人能把飛機劫持的這麼遠
No hijacker has ever taken a plane this far away

368
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,180
在我們軍隊的部署範圍內
from the operational sphere of our armed forces.

369
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,610
這肯定是哈達德乾的
It must be Haddad.

370
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,980
總理 你不能屈服
Prime Minister, you can't give in,

371
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,420
否則任何成為目標的以色列人
or every Israeli they target

372
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,150
將會被脅迫去另一個國家
will be taken to another country.

373
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,390
國防部長 你的任務是策劃
Defense Minister, your job is to come up

374
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,090
前往非洲的軍事行動
with military options for going to Africa.

375
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,230
一旦你有一個可行方案 我會決定來做什麼
Once you have a viable one, I'll decide what to do.

376
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,900
有什麼問題嗎？
Any questions?

377
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
阿莫斯將協調成立一個緊急委員會
Amos will coordinate an emergency committee.

378
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,470
當我們收到劫機者的要求時 我們會再見面的
As soon as we get the demands, we will meet again.

379
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,440
你知道 這不是佩雷斯的問題
You know, this is not Peres' problem.

380
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,350
你才是整個政府的門面
It's your face on the front of every newspaper.

381
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,420
如果是哈達德的話 他會要求
If it's Haddad, he's going to demand

382
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,250
我們釋放監獄裡的所有恐怖分子
the release of every terrorist in our jails.

383
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,390
你不能釋放他們
Well, you can't release them.

384
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,320
那將會是政治自殺
That's political suicide.

385
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,530
我知道
I know that.

386
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,900
這鱷魚不錯

387
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,860
我覺得我們該試著跟我們的德國「首領」談談

388
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,780
我們不能跟這種人談判

389
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,110
也許我們能看穿他們腦子裡想的什麼

390
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,380
你該吃點東西

391
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,460
我不餓

392
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,060
我想我得跟他談談

393
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,190
你確定？

394
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,700
接下來要怎麼辦
How is this going to work?

395
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,770
接下來要怎麼辦
How is this going to work?

396
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,140
這地方很臟 我們還有孩子
This place is filthy. We got children here.

397
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,440
我會打掃乾淨的
I'll have it cleaned.

398
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,780
然後他們會提供床墊
And they'll bring mattresses.

399
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,480
一切都會好起來的
It's all going to be fine.

400
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,280
別擔心
Don't worry.

401
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,320
我為什麼要相信一個瘋狂的德國革命派
Why should I believe a crazy German revolutionary?

402
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,460
一切都會搞清楚的
Everything will become clear.

403
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,490
一切
Everything.

404
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,410
把燈打開
Turn it back on.

405
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,280
你睡覺時還亮著燈嗎？
Do you still sleep with your lights on?

406
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,290
回去睡覺
Go to bed.

407
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,420
他們在數有多少以色列護照

408
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,200
是啊
Ja.

409
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,740
我們得知道這些乘客都是誰

410
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,700
睡覺吧

411
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,310
以色列是一個法西斯國家
Israel is a fascist state,

412
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,850
真正的反法西斯意味著
and true anti-fascism means clear and simple solidarity

413
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,450
和巴勒斯坦人簡單明瞭的團結
with the Palestinians.

414
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,450
別再喊這些口號了
Stop quoting these slogans.

415
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,650
德國人劫持了一整個飛機的以色列人
Germans hijacking a planeload of Israelis.

416
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,690
還有猶太人 你們覺得全世界會有怎樣的反應
Jews. How do you think the world's going to react?

417
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,430
你知道的 我們會面臨的唯一事實就是
You know, the only thing that we have to face is the fact

418
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,860
德國人不會分析
that German people cannot analyze

419
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,400
近東的爭端
the conflict in the Near East

420
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,570
因為我們都被愧疚麻痺了
because we are all paralyzed by guilt.

421
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,640
西德是一個法西斯社會 胡安·帕布洛
West Germany is a fascist society, Juan Pablo.

422
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,570
也許你看來並不是這樣
Perhaps it doesn't appear so to you,

423
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,810
但對那些掌權人都是一樣的
but those who are in charge are the same ones

424
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,310
那些曾經在納粹手下掌權的人
who were in charge under Nazism.

425
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,310
他們的愧疚給以色列
And their guilt has provided the funds

426
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,840
提供了發展成
which have allowed Israel to develop

427
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,550
一個帝國主義軍事基地的資金
into an imperialist military base.

428
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,250
我們不能只讀這些書
We can't just read these books.

429
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,250
我們需要去成為他們所代表的東西
We need to become them.

430
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,350
湮滅是屬於青少年的詞
Annihilation is for adolescents.

431
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,850
我們有革命的權利
There's a right of revolution

432
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,160
去反對政治壓迫和社會不公
against political oppression and social injustice.

433
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
你沒有被壓迫 你有工作的
You are not oppressed. You have a business.

434
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,830
我們有革命的權利去反對資本主義
There's a right of revolution against capitalism.

435
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,830
你就是個資本家
You are a capitalist.

436
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,500
我們都是資本家
A bourgeois. We all are.

437
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,400
如果這就是你所想的 那我們需要去行動
If that is what you think, then we have to act,

438
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,930
我們現在就需要行動
and we have to act now.

439
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,200
我不知道你在害怕什麼 胡安·帕布洛
I do not know what you are scared of, Juan Pablo.

440
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,740
我什麼都不害怕
I'm not scared of anything.

441
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,480
但是你應該害怕
But maybe you should be.

442
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,380
我只怕毫無意義的生活
I only fear a life without meaning.

443
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,420
我在哪

444
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:47,570
我在哪

445
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,910
需要幫助嗎 女士
Can I help you, madam?

446
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,280
很抱歉 我不會說德語
I'm sorry, I don't speak German.

447
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,950
試試 試著呼吸
Just try... try to breathe.

448
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,070
幫幫我

449
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,790
現在 聽著
Now, listen.

450
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,730

451
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,730

No, no.

452
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,730
不 拜託 請不要這樣做
No, please... please don't do that.

453
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,700
拿著

454
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,000
別這樣 你想做什麼
No, wh-what are you doing?

455
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,700
別這樣
No.

456
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,370
請不要傷害我

457
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,770
好的 沒事的 放輕鬆
Okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

458
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,540
我、我不太明白你在說什麼 但
Please. I-I don't understand what you're saying, but...

459
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,480
聽著 請冷靜下來
Listen. Please calm down.

460
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,650
請保持冷靜 冷靜
Just calm down. Calm down.

461
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,850
我不明白她在說什麼
I don't understand what she's saying.

462
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,100
發生什麼了

463
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,440
沒事 你不用給我們錢

464
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,140
放好 我們不要你的錢 跟我來

465
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,060
跟我來

466
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,550
兩個德國人
Two Germans.

467
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,920
是的
Yes.

468
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,960
你說過
You said.

469
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,400
他們將參與革命
They'll be revolutionaries.

470
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,670
七個小時了 還沒有消息
Seven hours now, no news.

471
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,840
這次有點奇怪
This time, it's different.

472
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,740
他們都在工作中 伊扎克
They are doing what they are doing, Yitzhak.

473
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,480
你現在什麼也做不了
There is nothing you can do about it.

474
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,320
多睡會吧
Get some sleep.

475
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,920
別擔心

476
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,220
一切都會好的

477
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,580
任何救援部隊
Any rescue force

478
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
都要悄無聲息的接近老航站樓
would have to approach the old terminal unnoticed.

479
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,580
我們可以用大力神運輸機
Look, we can put the men on a Hercules

480
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,400
以色列軍事情報局

481
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,950
然後在晚上降落
and land at the airport at night.

482
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,590
-沒有跑道燈？ -是的、
- Without runway lights? - Yeah.

483
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,520
很棒
That's great.

484
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
我認為拉賓不會同意的
I don't think Rabin will go for that.

485
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,760
那如果我們空投一小隊傘兵呢
What if we drop a small parachute force instead?

486
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,460
呃 傘兵的話
Uh, parachute force

487
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,560
在一個地區太分散了
would be dispersed over too large an area.

488
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,600
那我們可以通過維多利亞湖
So we could use Lake Victoria.

489
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,670
要麼空降後晚上乘氣墊船進去
Either parachute in with inflatable boats at night,

490
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,640
要麼通過肯尼亞
or cross from Kenya.

491
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,040
埃胡德 維多利亞湖有鱷魚的
Ehud, there are crocodiles in Lake Victoria.

492
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,150
而且橫跨整個湖也不可能
Plus, it's impossible to come all the way across the lake

493
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,410
從肯尼亞乘無人註意的橡膠船接近老航站樓
from Kenya in rubber boats unnoticed.

494
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,020
這不是演習 好嗎？
This is not a drill, okay?

495
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,650
這是真實的作戰
It's the real world.

496
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,560
莫塔 為什麼我們不讓突擊隊
Motta, why don't we send in the commandos,

497
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,660
佔領機場 然後等候伊迪·阿明的消息
take the airport, and then wait to hear from Amin?

498
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,860
呃
Well...

499
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,570
如果你想控制機場
if you want to take control of the airport,

500
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,700
你需要派遣一支大得多的部隊
you're gonna have to use a much bigger force.

501
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,740
你能給我一些具體的數字嗎？
Could you run some numbers for me?

502
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,870
明天我想要提出一個計劃
I want to present a plan tomorrow.

503
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,740
然後 呼叫特殊部隊到基地來
Also, call special forces unit to base.

504
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,750
當然 國防部長
Of course, Defense Minister.

505
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,880
謝謝
Thank you.

506
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,380
不客氣
No problem.

507
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,890
我想我知道拉賓為什麼要讓莫塔來了
I think I know why Rabin wanted Motta here.

508
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,460
他想要阻止我們規劃出
He wants to stop us from coming up

509
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,660
一個可行的軍事行動
with a viable military option.

510
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,970
那樣他就不需要做決定了
That way, he doesn't have to make a decision.

511
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,110
他想把這場危機歸咎於你
He wants to blame you for this crisis.

512
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,840
這就是政治
That's politics.

513
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,460
你知道嗎 我真希望我也能做到
You know, I wish I could do that.

514
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,220
來了一個電話
There was a phone call.

515
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,830
他們希望你明天回到基地
They want you back at base tomorrow.

516
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,570
什麼時候首演
When is the premiere?

517
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,030
跟它無關
It's not about that.

518
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,100
你知道我沒有選擇的 對吧？
You know I have no choice here, right?

519
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,740
薩拉 我必須去 這是我的工作
Sarah, I have to go. It's my job.

520
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,510
總歸是有其他選擇的
There's always a choice.

521
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,550
你說錯了
That's not true.

522
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,080
那些人質有什麼選擇？
What choice do those hostages have?

523
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
如果你覺得自己沒有選擇
If you think you have no choice,

524
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,890
那你也是一名人質
you're a hostage, too.

525
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,510
第三日

526
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,420
1976年 6月29日 星期二

527
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,670
特殊任務總部

528
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,690
薩拉
Sarah.

529
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,830
跳舞 就像生活
Dancing, it's like life.

530
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,240
你受傷了 退縮了 沒關係
You get hurt, you retract. That's okay.

531
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,840
但是如果你變得如此害怕 總想被保護
But if you become so afraid that you're always guarded

532
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,240
永遠不冒險
and never take a leap of faith,

533
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,680
你就永遠不會跳舞
you won't be able to dance.

534
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,220
再來一次
Again.

535
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,220
從頭開始
From the beginning.

536
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,990

-搬著椅子 全都拿著 –很好

Whose jacket is that? Please move everything.

547
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,970
-不要留下任何東西 -聽著 我們這麼做
- Leave nothing behind. - Listen, we're doing this

548
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,910
是為了製造更多的空間 很好
to create more space. It's all good.

549
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,080
這裡太擠了
It's too crowded in here.

550
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,280
明白嗎？
Okay?

551
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,850
聽到你自己名字的時候 站起來
When you hear your name, you stand up,

艾布拉姆斯 伊薩克
Abrams, Isaac

559
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,660
我們沒同意過這個

560
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,080
-放鬆點
-都是放屁 他們在騙我們

我不能離開我的孩子們

- Hurry up. Hurry up! - I must protest at this.

575
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,970
不 你們不能這樣做 這是錯的
No, you can't be doing this. This is wrong.

576

-她不能離開她的孩子 –不可能離開 –喂！喂！
- She can't leave her children. - It's impossible. - Hey, hey!

580
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
我們不同意這樣做
We didn't agree to this.

581
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,390
-看住乘客們 –我不是納粹
- Watch the passengers. - I'm not a Nazi.

582
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,990
-看住乘客！ -喂！坐下！喂！
- Watch the passengers! - Hey! Sit down! Hey!

583
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,390
我想和哈達德談談
I want to talk to Haddad.

584
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,020
-以後再談 –我們得現在談
- Later. - We talk about this now.

585
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,890
-我們現在就談談這事！ -看住乘客們！
- We talk about this now! - Watch the passengers.

586

587
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,230
現在 他媽的把嘴閉上 所有人！

596
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,100
烏曼 麗貝卡
Ullman, Rebecca.

597
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,170
以色列人？
Israeli?

598
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,940
你為什麼有法國護照和以色列身份證？
Why do you have French passport and Israeli I.D. card?

599
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,980
噢 我…我是法國公民
Well, I-I'm a French citizen.

600
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,340
我在以色列工作
I was working in Israel,

601
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,610
所以 呃 我拿到了那張
and, uh, I've got that I.D. card,

602
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,110
和我護照一起交上去的身份證
which I handed in with my passport.

603
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
你是士兵
You are soldier.

604
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,580
不 我是法國人 我 呃……
No, I'm French. I, uh...

605
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,490
你是間諜
You are spy.

606
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,420
等等 不 我是法國公民
Wait. No, I-I'm a French citizen.

607
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,120
過來吧
All right.

608
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,590
-快走 快走！ -好
- Move. Move! - Okay.

609
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,230
他是法國人
He's French.

610
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,900
他是你朋友？
He is your friend?

611
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,030
-對 –那你也去那邊
- Yes. - Then you go through there, too.

612
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,510
為了這項計劃的成功
For this plan to succeed,

613
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,440
我們必須動用足夠的軍事力量
we need to use a big enough force

614
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,540
來奪取機場的控制權
to seize control of the airport.

615
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,650
首先 我們動用突擊隊員 殺死恐怖分子
First, we use the commandos, kill the terrorists,

616
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,280
確保人質安全
secure the hostages.

617
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,050
然後我們空運增援部隊
Then we fly in reinforcements.

618
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,920
包括重型武器 至少1000個士兵
Heavy weaponry, at least 1,000 men.

619
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,330
西蒙 你要入侵烏干達？
You want to invade Uganda, Shimon?

620
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,400
哦 我們離開的時候再還給他們
Oh, we give it back to them when we leave.

621
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,530
我們不能入侵一個聯合國
We cannot invade a country that is a member

622
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,670
和及非洲聯盟成員國
of the UN and the African League.

623
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,970
並且運輸這麼大規模的部隊是不可能的
And it's impossible to move a force of that size

624
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,270
4000公里的秘密潛入
4,000 kilometers undetected.

625
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,110
我們必須行動
We have to act.

626
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:12,040
絕不與恐怖分子談判
There can be no negotiations with terrorists.

627
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,610
我正在和參謀長談話 西蒙
I'm talking to the chief of staff, Shimon.

628
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,980
軍人 而不是政客
The soldier, not the politician.

629
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,250
我必須同意總理的意見
I have to agree with the prime minister.

630
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,450
我們需要查出阿明 是否在幫助他們
We need to find out if Amin is helping them.

631
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,020
你去過烏干達 對吧？你和他打過交道？
You were in Uganda, right? You dealt with him?

632
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,120
我訓練過他的軍隊 是的
I trained his army, yes.

633
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,000
我寧願假設他不會向法國宣戰
I'd like to assume he's not gonna declare war on France.

634
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
話雖如此 這人絕對是瘋了
Having said that, the man is absolutely crazy.

635
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,370
他可能有想法 某種野心
He might have a dream, some kind of a vision,

636
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,400
任何事都有可能發生
and anything can happen.

637
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,080
我可以試著打給他
I can try... call him.

638
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,480
如果阿明 在恐怖分子一邊
If Amin is on the terrorists' side,

639
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
我們可能不得不進行談判
we may have to negotiate.

640
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,250
總理 他們要求釋放52名恐怖分子
Prime Minister, they are asking for 52 terrorists.

641
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,750
以色列人不能投降 決不
Israel cannot capitulate. It cannot.

642
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,720
他們後天起將開始
They're going to start killing the hostages

643
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,220
殺害人質
the day after tomorrow.

644
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,460
打給阿明
Call Amin.

645
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,160
我想知道他的立場
I want to know where he stands.

646
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,750
總統官邸

647
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,170
他們已經把猶太人集中
They have moved the Jews together

648
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,170
在恩德培老航站樓了
at the old terminal at Entebbe.

649
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,570
他們用烈性炸葯把人質集中起來
They have surrounded them with high explosives.

650
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,580
在飛機上和航站樓周圍都有TNT炸葯
They have TNT on the plane and all around the building,

651
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,450
甚至他們身上也有
even on their bodies.

652
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:25,620
他們說他們將與人質一起自殺
They said that they will commit suicide with the hostages.

653
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,020
告訴你們政府 我無能為力
Tell your government there is nothing I can do.

654
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,250
但是 閣下 這是在你們國家
But, Your Excellency, this is your country.

655
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,660
你有一個機會
You have an opportunity

656
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,630
作為英雄被載入史冊
to go down in history as a great man.

657
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,230
救了那些人質的英雄
The man who saved these people.

658
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,430
這是一個上帝賜予你的
This is a-a great opportunity, sir,

659
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,030
極好的機會
given to you by God.

660
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,130
那些恐怖分子想要你們
All the terrorists want is for you

661
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,400
把你們的囚犯送到這裡來
to send your prisoners here.

662
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,980
不要聽坐在那你旁邊的巴勒斯坦人民解放組織的人
Don't listen to those from the PFLP sitting beside you.

663
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,480
你在冒犯我 老朋友
You are offending me, old friend.

664
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,350
我試圖做的就是
All I'm trying to do

665
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,750
確保人質安全
is make sure the hostages are safe.

666
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,280
很抱歉 閣下
I'm sorry, Your Excellency,

667
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,820
但是請考慮一下我說的話
but please consider what I'm saying.

668
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,320
不要錯過這個機會
Don't miss this opportunity

669
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,360
向那些說你壞話的人展現
to show the people who say bad things about you

670
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,630
您是個多麼偉大的人
what a great man you are.

671
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,730
實際上 我…我想這會
Actually, I-I think this will

672
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,500
使你獲得諾貝爾和平獎的
get you the Nobel Prize for peace.

673
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,700
呃 閣下？
Uh, Y-Your Highness?

674
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,480
閣下？
Y-Your Highness?

675
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,380
為什麼巴勒斯坦人民解放組織想要我們
Why would the PFLP want us

676
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,220
把他們的囚犯送到烏干達？
to fly their prisoners to Uganda?

677
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,450
我認為這是阿明的主意 不是巴勒斯坦人的
I think that's Amin, not the Palestinians.

678
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,690
人質被釋放的時候他想在場
He wants to be there when the prisoners are released.

679
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,820
他想告訴蘇聯人和阿拉伯人
He wants to show the Soviets and the Arabs

680
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,660
現在他和他們是一夥的
that he is with them now.

681
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,560
他想獲得他們的認同 他們的支持 他們的武器
He wants their approval, their support, their arms.

682
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,630
還有500萬塊錢
The $5 million.

683
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,630
如果烏干達人與恐怖分子達成一致
If the Ugandans are with the terrorists,

684
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,170
麻煩就更大了
this operation will have to be even bigger.

685
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,370
我和基辛格談過
I spoke to Kissinger.

686
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,170
他說人質都死了
He said it's better if everybody dies

687
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,210
也比我們談判要好
than we negotiate.

688
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,380
好吧 如果這跟法國沒什麼關係
Yeah, well, if it's not a French problem,

689
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,880
那它更不關美國什麼事  西蒙
then it's even less of an American problem, Shimon.

690
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,250
我們就盡自己所能吧
Let's do the only thing we can do.

691
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,220
不 請等一下
No, wait. Please.

692
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,760
伊扎克
Yitzhak.

693
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,790
西蒙 我跟你解釋下目前的情況
Shimon, let me explain the situation as it stands.

694
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,430
我們沒有情報
We have no intelligence.

695
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,530
我們只知道人質在舊航站樓裡
We only know the hostages are in the terminal.

696
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,830
其他什麼都不知道
Nothing else.

697
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,570
如果他們昨晚把人質轉移了呢
What if they moved them around last night?

698
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,140
如果現在有人
What if now we have people sitting

699
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,910
正拿著槍和手榴彈坐他們中間呢
in the middle of them with guns and grenades?

700
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,570
一旦他們知道我們正在接近
As soon as they know we're coming,

701
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,280
他們就會開始殺戮  男人... 女人... 小孩...
they start to kill the men, the women, the children.

702
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,650
所以他們在挑著猶太人 而你只想著談判
So they are selecting Jews, and you want to negotiate.

703
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,850
西蒙...
Shimon...

704
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,320
如果我們不談判   如果我們永遠都不談判
if we don't negotiate, if we never negotiate,

705
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
如果我們總是處在戰爭狀態
if we're always at war,

706
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,190
那我們就會把我們的國家變成一座監獄
then we will make our country a prison,

707
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,160
每個人都是囚犯
and every one of our citizens will be a prisoner.

708
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,300
我們的敵人就是我們的鄰居
Our enemies are our neighbors.

709
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,270
我們不可能擺脫他們
We can't get away from them.

710
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,140
總有一天 我們要為了和平而談判
One day, we have to talk and to make peace.

711
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,610
謝謝 先生們
Thank you, gentlemen.

712
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,580
他們怎麼知道你在這
How did they know you were here?

713
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,920
他猜的吧
He guessed.

714
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
神靈警告過我的母親
The spirits warned my mother

715
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,920
我不應該冒犯以色列人
I should never offend the Israelis.

716
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,590
我們應該聽我母親的
We should listen to my mother.

717
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,190
什麼意思
To your mother?

718
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,730
先放一些人質
Release some of the hostages.

719
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,500
這樣可以安撫法國人
It will appease the French

720
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
也能讓我們的計劃更順利
and make things easier at the airport.

721
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,220
我不覺得他是間諜

722
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,820
他們在折磨他

723
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,530
我來這不是當保安的

724
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,030
別抱怨了

725
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,450
他們把我們往局外擠

726
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,910
他們總是忽視我

727
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,370
在維也納和石油輸出國組織一起的時候

728
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,550
卡洛斯沒選我

729
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,750
我不只是個賣書的

730
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,920
你賣書都賣不好

731
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,550
你得對他們寬容點

732
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,220
你也太寬容了

733
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:20,970
他們不需要理解我們 他們覺得我們是納粹分子

734
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,680
他們是猶太人 我們是德國人

735
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,640
他們當然覺得我們是納粹分子

736
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,390
不然你以為呢？

737
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,730
期望他們理解我們？

738
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,980
當個納粹 他們至少還會害怕

739
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:31,650
放屁

740
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,650
我才不假扮納粹

741
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:35,900
操你媽

742
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:36,900
安靜點

743
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,280
他媽的
Scheisse.

744
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,410
你已經吃三次了

745
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,170
自從我們來這你就沒睡過

746
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,840
我自己來

747
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,300
這

748
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,840
再吃一顆

749
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,850
好樣的

750
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,990
這兒
Here.

751
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,890
這就是阿明的車
This is Idi Amin's car.

752
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,460
現在 烏干達的所有官員
Now, all the officials in Uganda

753
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,060
都用一輛黑色的梅賽德斯豪華轎車代步
use a black Mercedes limousine.

754
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,460
嗯
Right.

755
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,600
如果我們用這個接近舊航站樓
If we approached the terminal in one,

756
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,770
恐怖分子可能會認為是阿明
the terrorists would think Amin

757
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,140
來和人質交談
is coming to talk to the hostages.

758
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,670
這樣給了我們一個機會製造「驚喜」
That gives us the element of surprise.

759
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,640
給我一輛奔馳 我們會完成這個任務
Get me a limo there, we'll get the job done.

760
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,640
本尼
Benny?

761
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,610
你怎麼看
What do you think?

762
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,680
我們可以把奔馳放在大力士運輸機裡
We can put the Mercedes in a Hercules

763
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,980
還有特種部隊人員
with Sayeret Matkal,

764
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,020
飛機會停在新航站樓
land the plane at the new terminal.

765
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,550
- 嗯 - 他們可以開著奔馳
- Good. - They drive the Mercedes

766
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,990
去舊航站樓殺死恐怖分子
to the old terminal, kill the terrorists,

767
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,560
把人質安放在飛機裡 然後飛回來
put the hostages on a plane, fly back.

768
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,990
- 很好 - 現在 為了做到這一步
- Perfect. - Now, to do that,

769
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,660
我們需要控制整個區域
we need to control the whole area.

770
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,930
兩個航站樓都要控制
Both terminals.

771
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,630
那你需要什麼
And what do you need?

772
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,740
三個小隊...
Three companies of soldiers...

773
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,540
丹... 拜託了

774
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,570
兩個小隊
Two companies of soldiers,

775
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,540
還有裝甲和重型武器

776
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,080
- 那得要四駕飛機 - 對 快速行動
- That will be four planes. - Right. Move fast.

777
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,980
所有單位要保持警惕
Keep all units on alert.

778
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,880
拉賓已經和法國人協商過了
Rabin is already talking to the French.

779
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,150
好的 我們有新任務了 快來
Okay, we have new orders. Come down.

780
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,990
走吧
Let's go.

781
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,020
第四日

782
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,420
1976年 6月30日 星期三

783
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,630
好 好
Yes, yes.

784
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,100

785

快來上車 快上車

787

當你們到達目的地的時候
And when you arrive at your destination,

788
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,680
請告訴他們

789
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,110
烏干達總統保障了你們的安全
that the president of Uganda guaranteed your safety.

790
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,180
啊 修女 我是你的朋友

- 請為我們祈禱 - 我不想走
- Please say a prayer for us. - I don't want to leave.

792
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,190
我想把我的座位讓給那些
I would like to offer my place to one of the Israeli people

793
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,620
被挾持的以色列人民
who are being held.

794
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,720
那是不可能的
That will not be possible.

795
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,860
我沒打算走
I am not going to go.

796

請上車
Please get inside the bus.

797
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:53,700
不 我不打算走

798
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,670
她糊塗了
She's confused.

799
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,670
快幫她上車
Please help her get inside the bus.

800
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,700
- 不 我要留下來 - 幫她上車

- 拜託了 - 上車
- Please. - Get in.

805
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,850
沙羅
Shalom.

806
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,590
恐怕我不是來帶來好消息的
I am afraid I'm not the bearer of glad tidings.

807
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,560
我保證我會盡我所能
I promised I would do everything in my power

808
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,860
讓你們被放出去
to have you released.

809
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,870
但是他們還沒有收到你們政府的消息
But they haven't heard from your government yet.

810
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:05,100
最後期限是24小時
The deadline is 24 hours away.

811
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,640
我很擔心你們
I'm very worried about you.

812
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:13,580
這些人與你們無冤無仇
These men bear no grudge against you.

813
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,750
他們只恨你們法西斯式的以色列政府
Only against your fascist Israeli government.

814
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:22,620
但是如果你們的政府不談判的話
But if your government do not negotiate,

815
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,560
他們會殺死兩個孩子
they will kill two children

816
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,630
每24小時
every 24 hours.

817
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,900
就從這兩個孩子開始
Starting with these two.

818
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,810
你怎麼能做得到
How can you do this?

819
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,350
拿著你的機槍站在這裡
Standing here with your machine gun.

820
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,520
他們還都是些小孩子
These are little children.

821
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,720
我們有士兵
We have soldiers.

822
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,090
如果你想要戰鬥 去找我們的士兵
If you have to fight, you fight our soldiers.

823
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,930
我不想喝咖啡
I don't want a coffee.

824
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,140
齊夫 你有個電話
Zeev, you have a phone call.

825
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,200
真希望首演的時候我能在
Just wish I could be there.

826
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,710
你不能來嗎？
You can't make it?

827
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,080
我剋服恐懼了
I got the part I wanted.

828
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,610
嘿 那很好啊
Hey, that's great.

829
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,610
我為你感到高興
I'm happy for you.

830
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,850
你會安全嗎
Will you be safe?

831
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,550
別談這個
Don't want to talk about that.

832
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,220
你有一直想我嗎
Have you been thinking of me?

833
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,160
沒 我的意思是.. 你知道..
No, I mean, you know, it...

834
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,370
薩拉  有時候 你愛的人...
Sarah, people you love, sometimes...

835
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:44,900
想著你愛的人 嗯...其實...
thinking of them, it, um...

836
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,840
沒什麼用
it doesn't help.

837
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,380
是啊
Yeah.

838
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,310
知道了
I know what you mean.

839
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,860
你在射擊場練射擊了嗎
Have you been practicing on your shooting range?

840
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,860
練了
Yes.

841
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,260
每天都在練
Every day.

842
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:16,400
很好
Good.

843
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
誰的電話
Who was that?

844
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,100
我女朋友
It was my girlfriend.

845
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,970
她是軍人嗎
Is she in the military?

846
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,680
不 她不是
No, she's not.

847
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,140
如果你想和她在一起
If you want to be with her,

848
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,380
你得讓她參軍
you need to get her to join the army.

849
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,280
否則 你最好離她遠點
Otherwise, it's better you leave her alone.

850
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,850
你什麼意思
What do you mean?

851
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,920

炸毀法國客機

858
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,740
除非以色列政府滿足他們的要求

859
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,880
放走的48名乘客是去巴黎的

裡面的等候室

擠滿了人質的親屬和朋友

866
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,830
等著接回新釋放的人質

867
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:19,500
當然 這些人質都在這架飛機上
Many of them, of course, all of them on this flight,

868

872
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:33,550
怎麼了

873
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,760
不知道 什麼都用不起 沒水 廁所也壞了

874
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,640
骯髒的德國人

875
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,450
你必須知道你們做的事對世界其他地方的影響
You must know how this looks to the rest of the world.

876
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,480

880
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:26,200
你在重蹈他們的覆轍

881
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,560
不 我不是 我不是剝削者

我認為巴勒斯坦人民應當擁有權利
I believe in the rights of the Palestinian people.

883
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,470
他們失去了家園
They have no homeland.

884
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,940
你去過巴勒斯坦難民營嗎?
Have you ever seen a Palestinian refugee camp?

885

你見過人們是如何苟活的嗎?

還沒有

尊嚴...

是眾之所望

898
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,990
唯有獲得自由才能取得尊嚴

899
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:26,060
自來水使你獲得自由

900
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,260
廁所...
Toilet...

01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,030
讓你獲得自由

902
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:36,030
一個水管工抵十個革命家
One plumber is worth ten revolutionaries.

903
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,440
你有沒有想過你是在浪費生命
Do you ever think you're wasting your life?

904
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,010
沒有
No.

905
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,510
你呢?
Do you?

906

我是個工程師
I'm an engineer.

907
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,650
我能製造物品

908
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,160
一個工程師抵50個革命家

909
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:07,050
我不想讓博斯單獨跟乘客待著

910
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,330
他變得越來越大意了

911
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,580
他覺得這一切都是遊戲

912
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,870
如果你被困著跟他一起站崗 這就不是遊戲了

913
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:13,920
你一晚上都得聽他嘮叨

914
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,420
世界的革命

915
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,960
巴勒斯坦的革命

916
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,840
一直不停

917
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,690
你覺得以色利人會來嗎

918
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,300
我們已經把他們逼入絕境了

919
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,430
如果他們來了 那殺死他們對不對呢

920
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,140
他們殺了我的孩子

921
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,320
賈貝爾 這什麼情況?
Jaber. What is this?

922
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:36,160
度假營嗎?
A holiday camp now?

923
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,900
他們是孩子 哈里曼
They are children, Halima.

924
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,500
以色列政府
The pressure on

925
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,070
所面臨的壓力是巨大的
the Israeli government was tremendous,

926
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:50,610
尤其是來自國民的壓力
especially from within the country.

927
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,540
以色列人質的親屬

928
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,240
於今天上午
held an emotional meeting

929
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,250
和政府代表舉行了會晤
with government representatives this morning.

930
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,720
他們不在乎以色列的一個基本國策
They didn't care that Israel has a basic policy

931
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,980
那就是不和恐怖分子做交易
of not dealing with terrorists.

932
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,350
今天早晨
Late in the morning,

933
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:03,650
他們衝進了政府大樓
they stormed the government compound,

934
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,820
擊垮了軍事警察
overwhelming military police,

935
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,520
試圖找到總理拉賓
in an effort to get at Prime Minister Rabin

936
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,260
並告訴他他們的想法
and tell him what they thought.

937
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,400
我們訴求結果! 我們不能把他們留在那兒!
We want answers! We cannot leave them there!

938
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,440
家屬想讓我們釋放人質
The families want the hostages released.

939
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,210
但作為一個以色列政客
But as an Israeli politician,

940
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,680
你不能和恐怖分子談判
you can't afford to negotiate with terrorists.

941
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,420
對
That's right.

942
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,150
這成就了我
That's what I've become.

943
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,420
總理!
Prime Minister!

944
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,360
拉賓總理!
Prime Minister Rabin!

945
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,690
我們想和總理交談
We want to speak with the prime minister.

946
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,460
-停! -我們要求和總理交涉!
- Stop! - We want to speak with the prime minister.

947
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,690
他欠我們一個解釋
He owes us an explanation.

948
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,700
我們想見總理
We want to see the prime minister.

949
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,430
等著
Wait here.

950
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,300
所有人 安靜

951
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:00,380
我們想要一個解釋!
We need an explanation!

952
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,370
大使先生 我是總理
Mr. Ambassador, this is the prime minister.

953
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,730
你去告訴法國政府
I would like you to tell the French

954
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,570
我們將和恐怖分子做交易
that we're going to make an offer to the terrorists.

955
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,740
讓人震驚的是 以色列人今天
To everyone's surprise, the Israelis today

956
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,640
改變了一貫的政策
reversed their normal policy

957
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,350
並同意和劫持者進行談判
and agreed to negotiate with the hijackers.

958
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:38,680
劫持者將截止日期延遲至星期日上午8時
The hijackers put off their deadline to 8:00 a.m. Sunday

959
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,180
就在以色列打破長期政策
after Israel broke its long-standing policy

960
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,620
並同意談判之後
and agreed to negotiate.

961
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,290
以色列的意見分歧
The difference of opinion in Israel

962
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,420
並不在於是否釋放人質
is not over whether the hostages should be released,

963
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:48,660
而在於從監獄釋放恐怖分子
but over whether releasing terrorists from jail here

964
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,590
的代價是否過高
is too high a price to pay for it.

965
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,760
今晚 西牆和眾多猶太教堂
Tonight, a special series of prayers began

966
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,270
進行了一系列特別的禱告
at the Western Wall and at most synagogues.

967
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:58,670
祈禱政府能夠
Prayers which expressed the hope that the government

968
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,770
對談判做出正確的決定
made the right decision on the negotiations

969
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,640
以及以色列和猶太人的人質
and that the Israeli and Jewish hostages

970
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,680
會從烏干達安全返回
will indeed come out of Uganda safely.

971
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,600
我們成功了

972
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,230
真的成功了

973
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,860
能做成功這種任務真是難以想像

974
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,440
賈博認為他們在耍花招

975
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,110
不是花招

976
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,820
我們會改寫歷史的

977
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,990
我們再也沒法回家了

978
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:36,950
現在還不能

979
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,910
不 是永遠不能了

980
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:40,920
你覺得巴格達怎麼樣

981
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,250
你完全不會明白一個女人在那裡活著會有多艱難

982
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,710
阿拉伯人都是社會主義者

983
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,510
換班了

984
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:59,430
-你到底在搞什麼? -什麼?
- What the hell are you doing? - What?

985
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,160
你把你的槍忘在了牆上
You left your gun lying on the wall.

986
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:02,870
猶太人有可能會拿走呢
One of the Jews could have picked it up.

987
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:04,770
放輕鬆 夥計 以色列人已經投降了
Relax, man. The Israelis have surrendered.

988
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,770
他們還沒有投降
They have not surrendered.

989
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,470
要是這是一個陷阱怎麼辦?
What if this is a trick?

990
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,240
要是他們只是以此來拖延時間呢?
What if they are buying more time?

991
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,680
-我們得做好準備 -好的 好的
- We have to be ready. - Okay, okay.

992
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,220
你在這兒做什麼?
Why are you here?

993
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,850
我想在群眾中
I want to throw bombs

994
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:25,250
來一個'炸彈'般的頭腦風暴
into the consciousness of the masses.

995
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,460
如果你得扔一個真的炸彈呢 我的朋友?
And what if you have to throw a real bomb, my friend?

996

997
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,400
你覺得你能做到?
You think you can do it?

我就不會拿起武器

當德國人屠殺他們時

1006
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,320
倖存者一無所有
the ones who survived had nothing.

1007

他們將死亡帶到巴勒斯坦

1011

你對他們這樣做了
You did it to them.

1012
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,580
你來到這裡只是因為你恨你的國家
You are here because you hate your country.

1013

我來這裡是因為我愛我的國家

做好犧牲的準備了嗎?

如果這個談判是一個騙局

我們可以低空飛越紅海
We can fly down over the Red Sea

1020
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,490
以躲開受到敵方雷達的檢測
at low level to avoid enemy radar.

1021
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,430

When the last plane leaves at 23:45,

跑道燈繼續保持開啟15分鐘
the runway lights stay on for 15 minutes.

1023
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,570
-那是我們的突破口 -嗯
- That's our window. - Mm.

1024
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:20,000
烏干達士兵沒有什麼威脅性
The Ugandan soldiers have nothing at stake.

1025
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:21,800
他們一旦看到我們抵達
Once they see us when we get there,

1026
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,670
-他們就會嚇得逃跑 -等一下
- they will start running. - Just a second there.

1027
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,410
你說你沒有足夠的燃油 對吧?
You said you didn't have enough fuel, right?

1028
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,010
這至關重要

1029
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,550
對 我們得在回來的路上重新加油
Yeah, we're gonna have to refuel on our way back home.

1030
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,580
長官 我們可以在肯尼亞加油
Sir, Kenya will be the best place to do it.

1031
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,850

這項行動不會成功的
This operation is not gonna succeed.

1033
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,760
這簡直在胡鬧好嗎? 這...這簡直是在做夢
This is a charade, okay? This... it's fantasy.

1034
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,760
德國人分裂了猶太人

These are my men.

1038

如果他們死了就是我的責任
If they die, it's my responsibility.

1039
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:56,940
不 莫塔 他們是以色列士兵

那是總理的責任
It's the prime minister's responsibility.

為什麼非得是你?

我們就此談過多少次了?

我們不能一直處於戰爭狀態

我戰鬥所以你能跳舞
I fight so you can dance.

1054

和乘客待在一起是我們的職責

1073
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,730
直到最後一刻

1074

兵貴神速

What if the first plane is identified and attacked

1107
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:02,750
在沒有支援的情況下怎麼處理?
before the rest of the force has time to land and deploy?

1108
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,150
他們就沒有機會了
They won't stand a chance.

1109
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,380
如果這失敗了

1110
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:10,890
對以色列國防軍的打擊 對以色列的打擊 將
the blow to the IDF, to Israel, will be...

我要把這個行動
I'm going to recommend the operation

Is there anything

1130
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,480
妨礙到他們解救人質嗎?
blocking their path to the hostages?

1131
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,050
沒有 長官
No, sir.

在航空站不會有任何問題
There are no obstacles around the terminal.

1133
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:30,250
什麼都阻擋不了我們解救人質
Nothing to stop our men reaching the hostages.

1134
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,920
在他們離開之前 我想合張影

1136
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:40,330
沒有什麼能阻礙這次的行動
There's nothing to stop the operation from proceeding.

1137
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:42,360
所以現在你必須做個選擇
So now you have to make a decision.

1138
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:44,000
如果我還是上將的話
If I was still a general,

1139
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,070
我不會同意這次任務
I would never approve this mission.

1140
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,570
這有極大的危險
It's a huge risk.

1141
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:52,340
你們知道的 這件事有非常多的變數
There will be casualties. You all know that.

1142
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:56,340
關於這次的任務不能有任何的猶疑
What we cannot doubt is the mission.

1143
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:58,310
我們必須完成這次任務

1144
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,120
我們一定要在三分鐘內到達航空站
We need to get to the terminal in three minutes,

1145
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,890
把所有恐怖分子解決並解救人質
kill all the terrorists and rescue the hostages.

1146
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:05,450
不能被其他事情阻礙
And we don't stop for nothing

1147
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,890
直到所有人質安全
until all the hostages are safe.

1148
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:10,630
我們將起飛到達火力範圍
We will take off and get into striking range

1149
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:12,560
在等待內閣的決定時

1155
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:38,170
我的職位在座各位應該都知道
My position is well known to those in this room.

1156
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,740
我肯定內閣會支持你的決定
I am sure that the Cabinet will support your decision

1157
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,680

1158
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,010
西蒙 飛機已經起飛了

1161
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:50,620
莫塔
Motta.

1162
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,790
你把這次行動報告給內閣了嗎?
Do you recommend this operation to the Cabinet?

1163
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:55,490
是的 總理
Yes, Prime Minister.

1164
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,760
先生們 阿莫斯將進行一個陳述
Gentlemen, Amos will now read a statement,

1165
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,390
之後我們進行投票
and then we will vote.

1166
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,530
政府部門決定
"The government resolves to approve

1167
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,060
贊同實施營救任務

由以色列國防軍實施
"by the Israeli Defense Forces

1169
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,440
解救恩德培的人質
"to free the hostages at Entebbe, according to

1170
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,170
依照國防部門
"the plan submitted by the defense minister

1171
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,370
和參謀長提供的營救計劃實施
and the chief of staff."

1172
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:13,140
在座各位是否支持?
All those in favor?

1173
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,750
那就這樣行動
So be it.

1174
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,160
雷霆行動按計劃執行
Operation Thunderbolt will proceed as planned.

1175
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,770
特拉維夫指揮中心
Tel Aviv Command Center,

1176
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:46,610
雷霆行動開始
Thunderbolt is a go.

1177
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:49,780
重覆 雷霆行動開始
I repeat, Thunderbolt is a go.

1178
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:53,550
預計到達恩德培時間為
ETA, Entebbe...

1179
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,320
23:45.
23:45

1180
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,360
減四小時 32
Minus four hours, 32.

1181
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:06,390
那是我們的通道
That's our door.

1182
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,700
是控制塔的第四層
It's the fourth from the control tower.

1183
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,740
胡安·帕布洛
Juan Pablo...

1184
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,110
我真希望和你待在家
I wish I was at home with you.

1185
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:32,780
我真希望我在家
I wish I was at home.

1186
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:37,260
我不知道我的家在哪裡
I don't know where my home is.

1187
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,630
當這些過去之後我們需要一個家
Think we need to find a home when this is over.

1188
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,500
在某個地方
Somewhere.

1189
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,440
和平的地方
Somewhere peaceful.

1190
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,850
賈貝爾認為以色列軍會來
Jaber thinks the Israelis will come

1191
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,520
並且會殺了我們
and they'll kill us.

1192
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:13,560
如果這真的發生 我們必須說出我們的想法
And then if that happens, we have to make a statement.

1193
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,530
這是我們在這裡的原因
And that's why we are here.

1194
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,670
我在擔心博斯
I'm worried about Bose.

1195
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,370
他在害怕
He's scared.

1196
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,340
你知道的 他很脆弱
He is weak. You know that.

1197
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:36,480
他們都很害怕
They're all scared.

1198
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,420
賈貝爾也是
Even Jaber.

1199
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,450
我不害怕
I'm not scared.

1200
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,530
我看清了
I see it.

1201
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,200
現在我看清了所有事情
I see everything now.

1202
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,800
我想你可能是對的
I think maybe you were right.

1203
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,640
但是如果我沒有來這裡
But if I never came here,

1204
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,580
那又意味著什麼?
what would that mean?

1205
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:12,320
不 你幫不上忙
No, there's nothing you can do.

1206
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:16,320
任何人都幫不上忙
There's nothing anyone can do.

1207
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,230
沒有人能逃出去
There's no escape.

1208
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:24,730
沒有人
No escape.

1209
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,610
或許我就不應該來
I think maybe I shouldn't have come.

1210
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:41,380
- 或許我就不應該來 – 女士
- I think maybe I shouldn't have come... - Miss.

1211
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,550
這些電話都沒用了
Those phones are not working.

1212
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:46,020
那裡還有電話
There are other telephones over there.

1213
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,300
再見 胡安·帕布洛
Good-bye, Juan Pablo.

1214
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,630
如果任務失敗 把這個遞交上去
If the mission fails, submit it.

1215
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,570
您認為的任務失敗是什麼呢 總理?
And what's your definition of failure, Prime Minister?

1216
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,780
25位人質在馬洛特死亡 這是個災難
25 hostages died at Ma'alot, and it was a disaster.

1217
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:52,380
這一次 營救25人左右就是成功
This time around, 25 or less will be a success.

1218
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:05,700
你早該走了

1219
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:06,870
走？

1220
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:08,870
去哪

1221
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,620
去叢林嗎

1222
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,290
不 我在想胡安·帕布洛

1223
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:19,380
他不適合這次行動

1224
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,510
需要我們最優秀的兩個人

1225
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:30,260
對不起

1226
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,980
胡安·帕布洛是對的

1227
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,150
我想來這

1228
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,510
我想來

1229
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,030
現在情況怎麼樣?
What's the status?

1230
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,970
最後一架民用飛機剛起飛
Last civilian flight just took off.

1231
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:23,800
應該在十分鐘內著陸
Should be landing in ten minutes.

1232
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,840
用無線電通信情況怎麼樣?
How about the radio communication?

1233
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:30,010
有許多干擾 但是能夠聯繫上
There's lots of static, but they're getting through.

1234
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,750
因此 目前來說 還不錯
So... so far, so good.

1235
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,750
好的 先生們
Okay, gentlemen.

1236
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,080
情況就是這樣
This is it.

1237
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:01,910
到了
Okay.

1238
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,660
我們突擊航站樓時
As soon as we hit the terminal,

1239
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:21,160
你們開始射擊控制塔
you start shooting the control tower.

1240
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,800
- 好  – 你明白了嗎?
- Okay. Yeah. - Yes?

1241
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,540
兵貴神速
Surprise and speed is the key.

1242
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:22,920
出發
Here we go.

1243
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,110
他們開槍了
They are reporting gunfire.

1244
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,910
現在太早了不能開槍
It's too early for gunfire.

1245
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:22,240
停下
Stop.

1246
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:25,880
是阿明嗎?
Is that Amin?

1247
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,280
無論發生什麼
Whatever happens...

1248
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:31,320
我們做的是對的事情
...we did the right thing.

1249
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,060
- 是以色列兵 – 關上門
- It's the Israelis. - Cover the door.

1250
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,360
關上門!

1251

01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:41,570

01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,750
我來

1254

1265
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,100
我們在飛機上

我們安全營救了102位人質

I repeat, we have 102 hostages safe on board.

1268
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:03,590
總理 祝賀你 你成功了
Congratulations on your success, Prime Minister.

1269
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:15,100
我們拯救了一百多人的生命
We saved a hundred lives.

1270
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:17,760
我們應當為此感到自豪
And we should be proud of that.

1271
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:20,130
西蒙,但是如果我們沒有協商成功的話
But if we cannot negotiate, Shimon,

1272
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,140
這場戰爭將永不會停止
this war will never end.

1273
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:08,290
因為劫機去世的四位人質：

1274
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:13,630
45名烏干達士兵 5名巴基斯坦人 2名德國人 也在恩德培行動中去世

1275
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:27,400
