1
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,795
Gin and Tonic, no lime Gin Tonic.

2
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,092
Lime is fine.

3
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,641
Don't got lime.

4
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:01,954
Even though I recognize my existence,
I often don't know

5
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,958
where I am or when it is.

6
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,543
What?

7
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,670
This happen to you too?

8
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:16,260
Do you think time is something that always flows?

9
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,845
That means?

10
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,389
In fact, time doesn't flow.

11
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,018
Past, present, and future.

12
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,853
They share one space.

13
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,023
You're in them all at the same time.

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,318
Doesn't feel like it.

15
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,612
It's how your brain processes it.

16
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,989
The idea that time flows

17
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,367
is only in your mind.

18
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,662
You mean I can travel to any moment?

19
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,290
Your emotions catching up is another story.

20
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,087
Then, fly me to when I was the happiest.

21
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,254
When is that?

22
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,133
Read me. I know you can tell.

23
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,264
Welcome.

24
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,241
Orange juice, please.

25
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,911
Sure.

26
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,356
Gin and Tonic, no lime Gin Tonic.

27
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,607
Okay.

28
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,362
By the way,

29
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,989
check out this photo.

30
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,035
It's beautiful.

31
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,453
Nice, right?

32
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,497
Keep it.

33
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,320
Can you take it over?

34
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,989
To her?

35
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,906
Yeah.

36
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,416
Here.

37
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,043
Thank you.

38
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,138
This too. Sorry I took it without asking.

39
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,396
Your bag is full.

40
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,984
Like a school trip.

41
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,904
- Perhaps.
- Leaving home?

42
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,831
Came out good. Keep it.

43
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,708
Bye.

44
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,722
She's a runaway.

45
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,100
Let her stay at Aurora.

46
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,061
She's got a place.

47
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:22,649
No, she doesn't.
That's why she's here. Look at her.

48
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,322
Got a place to stay?

49
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,785
If you want, stay at Aurora.

50
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,412
Aurora is,

51
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,750
the circus place over there.

52
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,128
I'm the owner.

53
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,091
If you're in trouble, I can help.

54
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,553
He's a famous photographer.

55
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,263
Cut it out.

56
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,852
He's okay.

57
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,620
You'll be the same age as Kaito soon.

58
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,623
I can't stand it.

59
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,043
Those dead are always dead.

60
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,964
Those left behind are always left behind.

61
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,136
Left behind, I'm becoming the same age as him.

62
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,518
I haven't accomplished a thing he hoped for.

63
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:30,110
To become an actor. To protect Aurora. Nothing.

64
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,238
Wasn't he selfish?

65
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,825
All he did was have expectations for you and die.

66
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,499
I was reaching my limit around that time.

67
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:48,837
Ten years is enough to realize this
isn't a sane city for people to live in.

68
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:53,175
Even so, I also realized
that I had no place to go.

69
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,261
I'm dumb founded every time I wake

70
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,680
to see the time now without Kaito

71
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,767
is longer than the time we made love.

72
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:07,105
Once upon a time,
Aki was a girl who dreamed of being an actor.

73
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,858
She grew up in the empty countryside.

74
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:14,988
She just wanted to be a princess in the box.

75
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,701
Aki, Aki.

76
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,204
You're next.

77
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,267
I was supposed to be an actor.

78
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,854
But for the past ten years
I've been a magician's assistant.

79
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,082
So, is this how you sometimes feel?

80
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,125
What?

81
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,793
If I had no dreams,

82
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,255
I wouldn't suffer a life
where dreams don't come true.

83
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:01,720
I used to think this wasn't how it was
supposed to be. And then...

84
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:08,018
Now I wonder what it was I was excited about.
Things like that.

85
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,519
That's fear.

86
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,231
I no longer see it as fear.

87
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,779
You do.

88
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,797
Feel it?

89
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,988
Who's your favorite character in Hamlet?

90
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,698
Huh?

91
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,366
Mine is Laertes.

92
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,993
Why?

93
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,662
He's the most human.

94
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,752
I would say Ophelia.

95
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,629
Isn't this the audition for Ophelia?

96
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,214
That's so ordinary.

97
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,177
I've a special feeling for Ophelia.

98
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,303
That is?

99
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,304
You care?

100
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,472
Yes.

101
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,558
Sorry.

102
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,272
I'm Maria. I'm not with an agency.

103
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,067
I'm Aki. Aki Oria.

104
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,904
Neither am I.

105
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,741
Freelance actors pass the application screening.

106
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,203
A fair audition, no?

107
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,956
It's to be director Bito's masterpiece.

108
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,626
That's right.

109
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:46,968
So, why do you have a special feeling for Ophelia?

110
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:54,726
We put on Hamlet in elementary school.

111
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,439
I got the role of Ophelia.

112
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,986
It was the first and last time I played a heroine.

113
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,159
So far, I mean.

114
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,580
I hope you can play Ophelia again.

115
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,500
Same to you, too.

116
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,484
What does "love" mean to you?

117
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,446
For me love is... Gain and loss...

118
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,123
Love?

119
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,474
Thanks. You may go now.

120
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,351
Sorry.

121
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,573
It's what saves me. But it's what's taken from me.

122
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,994
Perhaps...

123
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,332
I keep acting because I want to know.

124
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,756
What now?

125
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,890
Around that time I was reaching my limit.

126
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,027
Flashing through my mind was

127
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,447
how this wasn't how it was supposed to be, and fear.

128
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,408
The emotions I escaped from

129
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,869
and contained finally let go like a flood.

130
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,247
They erode and torture me to the bone.

131
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,586
My name is Aki Oria. 29 years old.

132
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:36,841
"To be, or not to be - that is the question ."

133
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,044
She's everywhere these days.
Film, TV, and commercials.

134
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,131
She was picked to play Ophelia!

135
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,218
Always up to the challenge!

136
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:24,848
The hottest actress today. Here she is!

137
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,227
Actress, Aki Oria!

138
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,440
Welcome, Aki.

139
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,821
- Aki.
- What?

140
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:45,410
In Japanese showbiz it's unusual
for an actress to make it in her thirties.

141
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,370
I thought to quit many times.

142
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,914
Now I see it as an honor

143
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,959
to encourage women of my generation.

144
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,962
Now it's time for...!

145
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,590
Charlie's Funny Time!

146
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,633
- Aki.
- What?

147
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,385
Aki, congratulations for Ophelia!

148
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:06,639
Thank you. It's a once-in-a-lifetime role.

149
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:07,682
When do you begin?

150
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,435
I'm discussing the part with the director.

151
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,313
You mean the world-famous Bito.

152
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,150
He's a great talent, a wonderful director.

153
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,110
You sound very busy.

154
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,199
So, when are the two of us going out on a date?

155
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,534
Okay, Charlie.

156
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,412
My schedule is full for the next three years.

157
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,459
Ask me during the Olympic Games, Charlie.

158
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,046
You got it. Charlie Max Time!

159
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,318
Aki.

160
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,446
You have a meeting in Roppongi
with the director at 7.

161
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,157
Can I use the car until then?

162
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,784
Why?

163
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,911
I'm going to Aurora.

164
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,540
I told you not to go there anymore.

165
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,544
Today is special.

166
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,174
Just don't be late.

167
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,727
Take me to Aurora.

168
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,004
Stop ignoring me.

169
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,171
- Why?
- Huh?

170
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,466
Why do you still turn up like this?

171
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,676
That means?

172
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,927
You know what it means.

173
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,764
I've no time for you anymore.

174
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,351
Huh?

175
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,022
You're me.

176
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,356
You're me too.

177
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,441
Don't get cocky.

178
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,818
You're the cocky one. It's why I'm here.

179
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,944
Getting suspicious?

180
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,487
Of course I am.

181
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:32,452
Jealous that I'm always working
and never have time for you?

182
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,911
I don't mean that.

183
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,246
You never change.

184
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,748
I said I don't mean that.

185
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,957
Disappear.

186
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,504
You mean it?

187
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,466
Sorry.

188
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,796
Thanks for coming.

189
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,589
Sure.

190
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:13,678
These days you're all over the TV.
It's such a surprise.

191
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,430
For real.

192
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,724
Are you busy every day?

193
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,893
More or less.

194
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,814
You're the same age as Kaito, right?

195
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,276
That's right. I am.

196
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,571
Finally.

197
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,073
Aki.

198
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,909
I haven't told you this.

199
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,704
We've decided to close Aurora.

200
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,038
What?

201
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:45,918
You know we don't make much money.
I thought maybe it's time.

202
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,503
It's my call.

203
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,300
I see...

204
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,136
It'll be pulled down in a month.

205
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,346
We're open until then.

206
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,599
Come back one last time.

207
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,186
Yes, I will.

208
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,290
You must be Aki.

209
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,334
I'm Aki. Nice to meet you.

210
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,714
Kaito told me. You're a runaway.

211
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,431
I'm Fuku. I'm the manager of Aurora.

212
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,808
Nice to meet you.

213
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:10,187
Feel free to use the dorm.
I'll get someone to walk you through.

214
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,814
Thank you.

215
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,191
Hey, Sand-Can.

216
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,153
Have Daisy run the Sphinx rehearsal.

217
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,365
She is?

218
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,162
This is Aki. Kaito brought her.

219
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,707
He picked up another young girl?

220
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,737
You like it?

221
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,365
Yes.

222
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,118
It was my dream.

223
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,873
As a kid,

224
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,293
did you get excited by magic or the circus?

225
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,128
I did.

226
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:20,049
They get me excited even now.

227
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,182
Stay as long as you like.

228
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:38,317
Well, thank you. Really.

229
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,199
Why'd you come here?

230
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,665
You don't have to tell me.

231
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,008
Three of us lived together.

232
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,763
Me, mom, and...

233
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,392
some guy.

234
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:16,522
He's the reason.

235
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,074
Plus...

236
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,702
You're not going to laugh?

237
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,579
What is it?

238
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,125
I have a dream.

239
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,964
I want to be an actor.

240
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,468
An actor?

241
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,600
Sounds so frivolous, I know.

242
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,394
No, it doesn't.

243
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,566
You're kind.

244
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,873
It's good to have a dream.

245
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,967
Why laugh?

246
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,138
Kaito.

247
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,223
Yeah?

248
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,978
In return for staying, can I work here?

249
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,313
Here?

250
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,526
Yeah, sure.

251
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,156
Kaito.

252
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,243
You say yes to anything.

253
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,120
That's not true.

254
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,210
Thanks.

255
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:22,398
In your opinion, what does Ophelia symbolize?

256
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:27,278
I think she symbolizes
the pureness we've forgotten.

257
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:34,869
Can you find something within yourself
in common with Ophelia?

258
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:39,748
I believe there is a part of me
that is in touch with her.

259
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,464
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you all.

260
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:52,511
You've garnered a great deal of media attention.

261
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,805
Seriously.

262
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:00,394
The concept that being young
is best doesn't fit these modern times.

263
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,355
We're vigorously promoting her.

264
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,190
Promote more.

265
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,068
She'll breakout soon enough.

266
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,575
Aki.

267
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,161
What do you think the world is?

268
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,079
Sorry?

269
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:04,875
The air, gravity, people aging.

270
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:10,464
Considering these common things,
don't you feel the world is too cruel?

271
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,926
So, what is the world?

272
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,851
What is the world?

273
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,732
In just half-a-year, my world changed.

274
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,653
Unlike before, I'm not hungry. I'm fulfilled.

275
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,072
My dream has come to be.

276
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,786
My life was founded on a dream.

277
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,248
Once fulfilled, a dream has to be maintained.

278
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,376
But that in itself is no fun.

279
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,213
People long for what they don't have.

280
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,383
What a luxurious hell.

281
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,301
Still, hell is hell.

282
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,756
Attain it, grasp it, lose hope.

283
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,592
Then they ask.

284
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,263
What is this world?

285
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,280
That's Ophelia?

286
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,448
No.

287
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,201
It's simply you.

288
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,496
It's just you.

289
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,959
How can someone like you sympathize with Ophelia?

290
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,356
Aki. Congratulations.

291
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,080
Aki, Aki!

292
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,331
Yes?

293
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,874
Kaito wants you upstairs.

294
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,084
Okay.

295
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,110
Stand there.

296
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,279
Yes.

297
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,748
There.

298
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,824
What?

299
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,953
You're like a snake.

300
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,330
A snake?

301
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,749
Yeah, a snake.

302
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,628
So...

303
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,964
In the next life I'll be a snake.

304
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,729
Aki.

305
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,402
You know.

306
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,240
I could die tomorrow.

307
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,744
That's true of me too.

308
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,166
Why did you approach me?

309
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,211
Um...

310
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,754
Too late.

311
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,539
Congratulations.

312
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,251
You got the part. Ophelia.

313
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,254
Good for you. Cheers.

314
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,729
Why the face?

315
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,150
Well then, try this out.

316
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,193
Huh?

317
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,306
"Rising Actress Aki Oria's
Dark Underworld Connection"

318
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,519
What's this?

319
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,354
We were set up.

320
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,898
Set up? By who? Why?

321
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,278
They ask, you insist you know nothing.

322
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:35,909
Aki Oria received money from gangsters
to debut in show business...

323
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,995
This is out-and-out slander.

324
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:39,955
Now you're famous

325
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,873
Is your memory selectively disappear?

326
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,041
What?

327
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,126
Whatever.

328
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,211
Where are you going?

329
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:51,216
To contain things. If this goes on
you'll lose your TV commercial contracts.

330
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,385
Wait.

331
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,221
Ophelia is okay, right?

332
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,688
What a shock Aki's scandal is.

333
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,607
She came to the studio the other day too.

334
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,361
Her agency denies the tie
between her and organized crime.

335
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,572
But there's no doubt it's her.

336
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,408
It's so scary!

337
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,078
They're here.

338
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,582
What about Ophelia?

339
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,335
What going on with Ophelia?

340
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,712
Go! Go!

341
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:49,441
You only call me
when things are going wrong for you.

342
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,109
So what? Help me.

343
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,611
Help from what?

344
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,447
I don't remember who he was.

345
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,575
Why was I there at that time?

346
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,327
I don't remember when

347
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,622
that was or whether it was real or a dream.

348
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,960
Can't be a dream. There's that photo.

349
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:12,756
My memories are a jumble.

350
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,049
So what?

351
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,593
You think I'm hopeless?

352
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,095
Didn't say it, but I think so.

353
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,140
I feel I'm missing something here.

354
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,227
You've missed everything from the start.

355
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,648
I don't want to listen to your preaching.

356
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,108
I'm not preaching.

357
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,779
You do this because you like it.

358
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,658
What kind of game is this? Tell me.

359
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,410
Ugly bitch.

360
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,162
You make no sense.

361
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,835
I can't lose Ophelia because of this!

362
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,799
It's a joke, a farce.

363
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,311
Who's the joke?

364
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,610
Is being around Kaito fun?

365
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:17,821
Huh?

366
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,197
Fun?

367
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,450
Yes, it is.

368
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,035
Okay.

369
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,123
Just know, he's out of your league.

370
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:34,629
It's cool. No matter how much
or how long women are there

371
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:39,884
for men, guys like young girls who
pop up out of nowhere more than anything.

372
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,221
Did you call me a young girl who pops up?

373
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,307
What else can you be?

374
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,893
I don't mean it in a negative way.

375
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,539
Hey.

376
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,252
See this.

377
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,671
What's that?

378
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:21,426
I made a mix for you. Took me all night.

379
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,013
Is it my birthday or something?

380
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,598
No, not that.

381
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,934
I don't need a reason for a present.

382
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,729
Play it.

383
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,231
Don't say it like that.

384
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,524
Right here.

385
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,780
I carefully choose ten songs that blew my mind
over the course of my life.

386
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,449
My life is packed within this.

387
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,911
It will be the best record of your lifetime too.

388
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,749
Your sensibilities do not necessarily wow me.

389
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,210
We'll see about that.

390
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,132
Aki.

391
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,683
When will you become an actor?

392
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,360
Make sure you do.

393
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:42,974
Hey.

394
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,600
Yes?

395
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,812
It disappears so suddenly.

396
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,150
What does?

397
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,110
Things.

398
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:56,404
Pretty much.

399
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,825
When I awoke, he was gone.

400
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,502
When I'm sad, I think of Kaito.

401
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,091
Not sure why.

402
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:25,016
His smile, his smell,

403
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,269
his body warmth.

404
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,272
Cut it out.

405
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,026
It hurts to hear you whine.

406
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,199
I vividly recall so much.

407
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,704
Say, Butch.

408
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,206
Yeah?

409
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,211
These days I think this isn't the only world.

410
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,717
There's another world somewhere.

411
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,013
Unlike here.

412
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,975
A better one.

413
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:17,860
I believe that Kaito is still waiting for me there.

414
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,823
Fine, then.

415
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:30,081
Only like that, can people grasp eternity.

416
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:39,423
Unless I think like that, it's too tough
dealing with someone's death.

417
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,579
She's everywhere these days.
Film, TV, and commercials.

418
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,749
For the much-hyped "Tokyo Hamlet,"

419
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:24,046
she was picked to play Ophelia.
An actress who never loses momentum!

420
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,424
The in vogue newcomer!

421
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,760
Let me introduce tonight's guest:

422
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,346
Actress Maria Yamamoto.

423
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,142
Thanks, Charlie.

424
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,312
There you are, Maria. Thanks.

425
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,022
What a career move.

426
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,273
Thanks, Charlie.

427
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,025
23 years old?

428
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:45,776
So young.

429
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,946
Things changed fast for you, yes?

430
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:52,450
My freedom and restrictions changed.

431
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,537
But what I do has not changed.

432
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,457
It's to play the roles I'm offered.

433
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,085
By the way, Maria. This man.

434
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,963
Know him?

435
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,382
Of course! He's Ryu Goto,

436
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,885
one of the film's producers.

437
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,554
He's smart and witty.

438
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,973
He has something to tell you.

439
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,142
Really? Charlie!

440
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,312
Let's check it out. Run it. Charlie.

441
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,397
Maria.

442
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,649
It's an important time for you.

443
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:29,153
It's a big chance. We'll get through it.

444
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,656
Let's make a great film and wow the world.

445
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,034
She's in your hands tonight, Charlie.

446
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,836
Let me see Ryu Goto.

447
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,341
We have no one named Goto.

448
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:54,929
Don't try and trick me. It's all a setup.

449
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,182
Ophelia is me. I'm Ophelia!

450
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,520
This one?

451
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:03,979
Your name?

452
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,856
You know, I'm Aki Oria.

453
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,859
- Can you walk?
- Get me Ryu Goto.

454
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,694
- Get her out.
- Get Ryu Goto!

455
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,280
Get me Ryu Goto!

456
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:31,382
Can you see?

457
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:40,057
Once she's calm, bring her to the office.

458
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:56,907
Aki Oria.

459
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,660
It's time to see reality.

460
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,430
Ryu Goto.

461
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,850
Where's Ryu Goto?

462
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:31,108
If you keep up with these delusions,
you'll face the consequences.

463
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,126
You're sick.

464
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:38,175
Don't forget, this is your world.

465
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,731
How did this happen?

466
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,236
Ignore me,

467
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,363
but at this rate you'll be killed.

468
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,744
After you showed up,

469
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:52,416
reality and fantasy mixed
and I wound up like this.

470
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,252
That's the wrong order.

471
01:01:56,421 --> 01:02:01,091
Your reality and fantasies mixed and
you wound up here. Then I turned up.

472
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,929
See these people.

473
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,266
Any connection with you?

474
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,934
None.

475
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:18,442
You obviously hate that nurse so much.

476
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,787
Maria Yamamoto?

477
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,874
No connection to you?

478
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,795
No. She just looks like her.

479
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:44,885
They are here because you wished it, no?

480
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,805
Remember this world is all...

481
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,306
Yours.

482
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,484
If this world is completely mine,

483
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,612
the first thing I'd do is

484
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,739
shut you up.

485
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,349
What does "love" mean to you?

486
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,027
Love?

487
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:48,866
For example?

488
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,535
What is love?

489
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,330
That what I'm asking.

490
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,208
Of course.

491
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,462
Anything else?

492
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,466
Thanks. You can go now.

493
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,469
Sorry.

494
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,397
Too bad about the other day.

495
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,274
Sorry.

496
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:06,443
It's okay.

497
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,531
Shooting's started and the director is busy.

498
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:19,581
I thought you were good in the audition.

499
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,459
The director didn't feel that way.

500
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:28,131
I'm a late-comer to the project
and don't have much say.

501
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:35,764
So, I thought you
and I could start a project together.

502
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:39,977
What?

503
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:46,358
I said we'll work together.
You'll be the lead, of course.

504
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:51,446
It will be a low-budget film though.

505
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,367
But, we should do something.

506
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,456
Sure.

507
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,136
Why so happy?

508
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,807
I got it.

509
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:20,726
Got what?

510
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,811
I'll star in a film.

511
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,734
Good for you.

512
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:34,281
Kaito would be happy.

513
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,953
- One more.
- Sure.

514
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,665
You want to star in a film.

515
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,709
Yes.

516
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,964
Then you must make this guy like you.

517
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,150
- It's her?
- Yes.

518
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,747
Aki Oria.

519
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,250
Yes.

520
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,184
You'll do a film with him, huh?

521
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,149
Yes.

522
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,525
Make it a good one.

523
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,485
Thank you, sir.

524
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,486
Not yet.

525
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,282
She'll take it with her later.

526
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,456
I understand, sir.

527
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,720
You're not even that young.

528
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,807
- Sorry.
- Get naked.

529
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:07,267
Huh

530
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:08,169
Gin and Tonic, no lime Gin Tonic.

531
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,883
Lime is fine.

532
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,849
Don't got lime.

533
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,196
That's enough, Butch.

534
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:41,870
Remember now?

535
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,665
That this is my world, right?

536
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:50,462
Yeah. But your world has too many bugs.

537
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:51,880
Like what?

538
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:54,716
You know exactly what I mean.

539
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:58,386
Unstable memories.
You drove yourself to that hospital.

540
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,555
All bugs.

541
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,390
Why?

542
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,351
You hit the limit.

543
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,147
You imagined too much.

544
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:17,572
But whatever you do, this is your world.

545
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,658
You make the last call.

546
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,496
The last call?

547
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:26,664
"To be, or...

548
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:29,918
not to be - that is the question."

549
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:39,219
Aurora will be torn down at any moment.

550
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:20,802
Everything one can imagine,
can be made to happen.

551
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:25,223
Sorry but this isn't real.

552
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,141
It's my world, doc.

553
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:32,564
Are you saying I'm part of your delusion?

554
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:24,676
Butch!

555
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,180
Aki, you go alone.

556
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,431
What?

557
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,767
I'm just part of you.

558
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,436
If you die, what's the point?

559
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,438
I'm part of you too, no?

560
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:42,276
No, Aki. You are you.

561
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,937
Now, press the switch

562
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,606
and Aurora will detonate. Goodbye.

563
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:32,280
Kaito. Let's get out of Aurora together.

564
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:38,744
We'll blow this place up and make our own world.

565
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:43,624
If I'm to be in a dream forever,

566
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,293
I want to be with you.

567
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:50,089
I'll even forget that it is a dream.

568
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:55,636
Let's start over from the top.
That's the happiest for us.

569
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:05,938
Aki.

570
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:18,492
If I'm with you, that's not starting over.

571
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,334
You must wake from your dream.

572
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,465
I don't want to hear you say that.

573
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,679
Why did you leave and die like that?

574
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,017
Why?

575
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:49,815
Why?

576
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:05,331
I'll stay here.

577
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,043
No.

578
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:15,383
No, no, no.

579
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,472
No.

580
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:26,310
Listen Aki.

581
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,315
The world is still wonderful.

582
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:37,905
You can manage. Aki.

583
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,042
I'm lost.

584
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:52,920
You're dead.

585
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:56,590
We won't meet again.

586
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,679
It's okay.

587
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,101
I'll find you again.

588
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,441
Next time as a snake.
