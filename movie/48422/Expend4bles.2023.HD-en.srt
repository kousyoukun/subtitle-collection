Maybe I'm complicated, but I'm not desperate

00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:54,531
Is that what we call it?

"complicated"?

Come on, Jenna, you're not meditating
.small details

What are the little details? You?

Are you my little detail?

God, my dear, you realize
The problem, but you ignore it

Do you really know what you are?
.You're a caveman

..Did you just tell me that?
Don't tell me to calm down! I am calm

31
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:24,496
I have never been so calm in my life

-What does this make me?

36
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,469
Does it make me nervous?

00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:41,269
.no no no

38
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:44,213
.Maybe a little violent

.I am a professional
Yes

40
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:49,580

-But I'm talking to you

47

What about you?

48
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:06,342
Maybe you're my boss

49
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,624
But I see that you are from this planet
Which is called "desperate."

50
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:14,132
Where intimate relationships are
Feelings do not exist!

51
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:17,057
God, I wasted so much
From my life to you

52

-You are a failure, but I like you
Thank you

Why are you here?

54

I lost my ring at the bar

-And I need your help
- Excuse me, is that all?

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,026
We will not talk?

57

61
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,752
.It's frustrating
No, it's okay

62
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,835
I like her, Bernie

63
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,297
She's part of the mercenaries, Christmas

64
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,750
Listen, I have a lot of respect
Your abilities are immense, indeed

65
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:05,233
But you really are a selfish bastard

66
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:06,782
- Really?
.All of us

67
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:10,759
We must choose this life
At the expense of friends or family

68
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:12,712
Are we doing it for the money?

69
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:15,813
This is the definition of depravity

70
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:17,955
What do you think of my perspective?

71
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:19,057
.it's good

72
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:20,205
..I believe

73
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:22,244
.You are an idiot

74
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:25,745
-You don't believe it
In every cell of my body

75
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,550
Why are we here?

76
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:30,323
I lost my ring tonight
,past during a quarrel

77
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,925
-And I came here to try to buy it again
-Seriously?

78
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,280
.Yes, seriously

79
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,709
You silly one

80
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,137
I am a fan of superstitions and I like this

81
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:41,408
.I feel like I'm missing a finger

82
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,916
I tried to get it back but this
A fool is not willing to negotiate

83
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,994
-Who?
.(Jumbo Shrim

84
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,752
-Who is he?
-You will see

85
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,502
How's it going, Bernie?
Hello, Billy

86
00:06:56,221 --> 00:06:59,361
So how did you lose your most precious possessions?

88
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:06,072
- Do you mean the game “hand drop”?
"No, I mean 'thumb duel.'

89
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:09,988
-So. GIVE me your hand
- No. "Duel of thumbs"?

90
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:12,363
You used to be strong, what happened?

91
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:16,342
And you were hairy, what happened?
Things change

92
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,436
How's it going, Bernie?
- What's new? Is Jumbo Shrim here?

93
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,068
.there is a problem

94
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:23,803
My friend wants his ring back

95
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,076
A bet remains a bet, my brother

96
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,701
.You know, no offense, but I miss my ring

97
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,881
.He will remain where he is

98
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,337
.this is unacceptable

99
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:38,416
.terrible resemblance

100
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:41,947
This is cruel

101
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:46,548
Are these guys, Bernie?
Yes

102
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:48,759
Now I understand why they call it Jumbo

103
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,134
No, the other guy. That man

104
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,002
Did you lose to Santa's helper?

105
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,533
.this is embarrassing

106
00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:58,994
.I was drunk

107
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:00,712
.But you're not drunk now

108
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,603
Why am I here exactly?

109
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:05,939
.My back hurts

110
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,438
How long?

111
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,322
A few weeks ago. I can't lift a fork

112
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:12,764
I'll do it for you, but if you don't want to
I understand if you feel threatened

113
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,092
the threat?

114
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:15,904
Wait

115
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,475
It will make things easier for you

.traditional

117
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:22,357
I'll take care of this, Thumb

118

.beer please

119
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:27,817
How are you on this beautiful day?

120
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,348
Would you rather I call you Jumbo?
Or "shreem-shrimp"?

121
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,224
..if you call me that again

122
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,240
.I will cut off your head

123
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,927
.That's a little harsh, kid

124
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,182
Bernie wants his ring back

125
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:50,904
What did you call me?

126
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:54,208
How much do you want to meet him, Yoda?
Wait!

127
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:56,777
.He will stay here, you idiot

128
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,082
.my back

129
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:07,116
..As you see

130
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:11,506
What we have here is an issue
Humility and human kindness

131
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:15,266
My friend here loves his ring
For all his stupid reasons

132
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:19,724
He will be nice and civil of you
Gentlemen, you understand this principle

133
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:21,661
..but since you chose to be

134
00:09:23,177 --> 00:09:24,911
What's the word, Bernie?
Stubborn

135
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:25,752
.very long

136
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:27,323
.Foolish

137
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,607
.Foolish

138
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,114
You left me no choice, you idiot

139
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:46,535
.You're welcome
-You have become slow

140
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:50,199
My turn, you bastard

141
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:55,012
.come on man

142
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:57,153
Come on, cowboy, come on

143
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,580
Have a beer ready for him when he wakes up

144
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:13,181
You almost killed me

145
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:15,916
.I thought your back hurts

146
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,611
.It's a miracle, he just recovered

147
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:21,541
He didn't need a show of love

148
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,595
I like spending time with you

149
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:30,361
Next time take me
To ride a pony, okay?

150
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:06,092
.Good

151
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:24,782
Field team, what's the situation?

152
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:30,071
Commander, there are three soldiers
They guard the general

153
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:33,649
We will need support
.I repeat, wait for support

154
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,281
What exactly does he do?

155
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,484
No, no, please! no

156
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:11,316
How are you, General?

157
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:23,907
Are my eyes deceiving me?
-Why?

158
00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:26,383
What does Gunner have on his head?

159
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:28,539
She looks like a sick cat

160
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,836
.Cute cats

161
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:32,999
.It looks like a shrub

162
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:36,233
Good evening, big guy

163
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,366
Let's talk about the thing that
.on your head

164
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,138
- The wig?
-Yes, the wig

165
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:43,956
The question is...why?

166
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:47,800
I was talking to a girl online
And she loved the '70s look, you know

167
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,338
Related to fashion

168
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,556
Understood. Have you met her yet?

169
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:54,589
Why wouldn't I do that? I love mystery

170
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,464
-Understood?
-Yes, that makes sense

171
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:57,948
-It looks special
- True

172
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,113
-I like it more when he's drunk
.I understand. Me too

173
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:02,811
.I'm happy for you

174
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:08,475
Is this the new guy?

175
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,592
Hello, Easy Day

176
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:13,382
.good man. Former member of the Special Forces

177
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,389
Hello, Bernie
Hello, Izzy

178
00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:17,749
Is this our sniper?

179
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:19,421
.do not worry about that

180
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,632
I have a specially designed binoculars
To be compatible with eyeglass lenses

181
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,093
What?

182
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:25,132
Okay, Hawk-Eye, remember that face

183
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,537
.Don't get it wrong

184
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:29,866
.You know, don't worry about me

185
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:31,123
Who is this man?

186
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,982
When you moved away, you hired him
He's Gallego's son

187
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:36,490
I inherited the sense of sight and the heart

188
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:37,943
And sexual desire from my father

189
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,884
.Suppose he doesn't talk as much as his father

190
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:41,111
.It's worse
No

191
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,306
Doubly so

192
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,095
It's going to be a long trip

193
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,157
I am Galan

194
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:49,094
Is it supposed to mean something?

195
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:55,930
.It's supposed to mean something
Okay, enough nonsense. Look at me

196
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:58,673
Who is this man in the suit?
His name is Marsh

197
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,417
I did some work with him before I met you

198
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,691
-He's from the CIA
Hey Bernie, how's it going?

199
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,105
How are you, Marsh?

200
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,292
how is your hand?

201
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,152
Gravity takes effect

202
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,653
Welcome to the group

203
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,482
I am happy to get to know you more
Guys, there's an urgent matter

204
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:17,091
I introduce you to Suwartu Rahmat

205
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:20,044
Former British citizen converted
To an arms dealer

206
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,348
And he has a private army

207
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:25,708
He was hired to steal warheads
A nuclear missile for a very dangerous customer

208
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:29,210
Rumor has it that the agent's name is Ocelot

209
00:14:30,643 --> 00:14:34,596
If those nuclear warheads fall into hands
Ocelot, he plans to use it.

210
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:37,096
To create international chaos
This must not be allowed to happen

211
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,080
This is why you came here

212
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:44,838
After you land, you will find Gaddafi's factory
..For old military chemicals in Libya

213
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,791
I heard it's nice there
.at this time of year

214
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:50,195
Your job is to make sure
The explosives remain there

215
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:51,938
Good?

216
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,500
.That's it. good luck

217
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:57,125
Bernie, keep them
-I will do my best

218
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,602
"Operation Ocelot."

219
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:03,763
When were you going to tell me?

220
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:06,005
When you stop messing with your girlfriend

221
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,616
Why is Christmas so angry?
About the "Ocelot mission"?

222
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,272
.He's acting like Christmas

223
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,014
.Understood

224
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:20,842
He knows Bernie well

225
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:24,123
He knows exactly what he can do
What he did to eliminate the ocelot

226
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,850
Who calls himself Ocelot?

227
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:29,327
Hired intelligence agency
Central (Bernie) years ago

228
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,319
In order to discover the identity of the name
The symbolic ocelot in reality

229
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:33,979
.It was close

230
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:38,120
Then someone ambushed him
.He almost killed his entire team

231
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,563
.the curse

232
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:40,882
.Okay

233
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:45,344
Some say the ocelot is just a ghost
Bernie invented it to cover up his mistakes

234
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:46,790
No way

235
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:50,565
Ocelot exists.
And Bernie will bury him one day

236
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:54,120
What happened to your ear, man?

237
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:55,959
.Glad you asked this

238
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:57,139
.I was a wrestler in college

239
00:15:57,202 --> 00:16:00,412
This is a common complication
This sport causes ear injuries

240
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:04,225
...Some blood collects in the ear cartilage

241
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:16,032
Come on, big bird

242
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:25,510
“Get off, you death plotter.”
-Don't insult her

243
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:35,331
We have a successful take-off

244
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:44,479
This was probably my first threesome

245
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,354
You know what I'm talking about
Hey, Toll Road, right?

246
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:51,128
.Listen

247
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,815
Do you know what a “golden shower” is?

248
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:01,073
It's when a woman kneels on top of you
She empties her bladder on you

249
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:02,253
.He's very liberal

250
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,714
Wow, international pervert

251
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,589
Do you know what a “golden shower” is?

252
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:06,329
"Sober life"

253
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:08,292
You seem like the type of person
.did that before

254
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:09,602
Let's stop listening to these losers

255
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,126
.I've heard a lot

256
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,790
.It's time for songs
.It's time for music

257
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,667
-It's old
.It's comfortable

258
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:20,613
Comfortable?
Yes

259
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:22,472
.maybe

260
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:25,355
.I had an anxiety attack last night

261
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,620
- Really? Are you sure?
Yes

262
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:30,777
Did you feel goosebumps?
And your heartbeat accelerates?

263
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:31,730
.exactly

264
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:34,417
Take some Xanax
And pretend that you are happy with life

265
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,636
!I am happy

266
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:39,136
By the way, you are the worst doctor ever

267
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,144
Maybe Jenna is being too hard on you

268
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:44,695
.It actually calms me down

269
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:47,460
This is the job
No

270
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:51,546
Some men are not meant for that
.be in a relationship. Face the facts

271
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:52,242
.Wrong

272
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:55,656
Maybe you want to die a man
A bitter old man, but I don't

273
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,781
.I want to be cheerful, happy

274
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:01,343
But I will come to visit you in the sanatorium

275
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,742
- Do you promise me?
.Scouting Department

276
00:18:05,797 --> 00:18:07,242
Let's see what's going on

277
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,421
A girl covered me in hot wax
.Forget this

278
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,320
Where are the explosives?
Never!

279
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:23,172
-Your wife
No, my wife! no. Allah is the greatest

280
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:26,008
Your son will be next

281
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:28,609
Please, not my son. Please

282
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,753
.Give me the explosives and I'll do it quickly

283
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:32,433
My son Adam

284
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:34,347
This is a fact that you cannot change

285
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:37,316
..Give me the explosives or else
- Not my son

286
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:40,160
The decision is yours
Okay. Good

287
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:42,066
.It's in the control room

288
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,136
..The safe code is...

289
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:46,394
.eight

290
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:48,303
.One

291
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:49,381
.four

292
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,563
.two

293
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,180
.Seven

294
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:53,500
.wise decision

295
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:58,484
Let's wake up the kids

296
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,367
-Are you ready?
Yes

297
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:09,687
.East. west
- West

298
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:21,507
Where did this come from?

299
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:23,444
.this will be fun

300
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,405
We are exposed to fire at the landing area
.-Forward

301
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:30,056
He confronted the missile
Okay

302
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,109
Intelligence was wrong

303
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:38,375
!Be creative

304
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:39,642
.No problem

305
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:42,018
Let's go

306
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:43,798
.gather. Gathered

307
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:45,401
-Shall I take the lead?
No

308
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,072
Take Gunner as cover and you'll be fine

309
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,935
!drop

310
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:04,790
Have a happy hunt!

311
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:12,563
.There's something going on at the weapons factory

312
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:13,555
We will handle this

313
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:21,156
We have four vehicles and many soldiers

314
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,859
Let's try to reduce their numbers

315
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:24,679
"Jump on this!"

316
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,553
Sir, I have a new means of transportation
Excellent

317
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:35,881
Tell Ocelot we got it
On explosives

318
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:37,506
!Let's go

319
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:42,561
.Positioned on site

320
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:46,826
Get in the truck!
.(The explosives are in the possession of Rahmat

321
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,279
Gunner, do you see them?

322
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,448
.clearly

323
00:20:57,106 --> 00:21:00,160
Gunner, you missed the target.
Do you need a guide dog?

324
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,262
.the curse

325
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:08,434
Stevie Wonder, maybe you should.
You should check your glasses

326
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:13,504
Be careful. Where are you, Lee?

327
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,395
.It seems we are on a chase

328
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,418
.relax

329
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,137
Let's fly, my dear!

330
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:35,217
Who the hell is this man?

331
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:36,763
What do we do, leader?

332
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:39,599
.Kill them

333
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:41,053
Shoot!

334
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,727
Gunner, we need some help!

335
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,618
.I've been sober for six months

336
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:09,584
This is what I'm talking about, Gunner

337
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,467
Can you get rid of them?

338
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,291
We will chase them!
- It is known

339
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
.disperse

340
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,783
Galan, we'll take the lead.
Chase the fugitive

341
00:22:32,815 --> 00:22:33,549
.known

342
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:48,788
We lost the 50 caliber machine gun

343
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:04,302
.He started from his side

344
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,060
It's time to improvise

345
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,333
.I can improvise

346
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:25,008
A bullet in the stomach. You will stay alive

347
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:33,715
Well, maybe not

348
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:45,501
Galan, what the hell are you doing?

349
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,016
.improvise

350
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,803
What's going on there?
I need to report the situation now!

351
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,007
One more and we'll reach Rahmat

352
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:21,536
What the hell, Izzy?

353
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:26,770
"(Easy Yesterday)"

354
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:27,559
.Okay

355
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,551
Initial success or miserable failure?

356
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:44,793
Initial success

357
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:47,488
.I'm out of ammo. Answer

358
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:56,649
You mean miserable failure

359
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:06,021
Christmas, where are you?
.They have taken possession of the explosives

360
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:07,575
They're on the west side
.They are heading north

361
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:14,552
Don't let Rahmat leave with explosives
.Otherwise many people will die

362
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,677
Step up, you losers! We'll go shopping

363
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:22,638
Watch behind you!

364
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,193
I'll shoot, guys!

365
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:29,295
!here

366
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:33,279
Be safe!

367
00:25:34,303 --> 00:25:35,451
They are shooting at us!

368
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:38,552
Don't worry, buddy

369
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,982
I will never abandon you

370
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:15,435
I can't find a clear angle to shoot

371
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,182
-I was exposed to gunfire
Damn it, Bernie

372
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,213
Focus on the mission, Christmas

373
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:31,908
You're done there!

374
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:34,057
.Listen to him, buddy
.Get explosives

375
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:37,443
Get the explosives, Lee!
!it's a command

376
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,194
No way. I'll save you, you idiot

377
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:03,467
!You're welcome

378
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:06,366
Well done, buddy
Who will take care of Rahmat?

379
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:16,427
Screw it

380
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:45,133
In memory of Bernie Ross, Chief.

381
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:52,761
I miss you, Bernie!

382
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:09,311
.Everyone is having fun

383
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,584
There is an old saying.

384
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:16,352
“Beware of the evil of an old man participating in an operation
The lives of the best young people are being lost.”

385
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:21,747
I'm sure they saved Bernie Ross' seat
.on the side of the table there for a long time

386
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:23,425
He deserved that seat

387
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,660
And he will never stop earning it

388
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:30,016
He brought out the best in everything
.One of us because he was the best of us

389
00:29:33,134 --> 00:29:34,134
To Bernie

390
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:35,767
To Bernie

391
00:29:45,843 --> 00:29:46,843
How are you?

392
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:48,817
.fine

393
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:53,606
No need to pretend, Lee

394
00:29:54,283 --> 00:29:56,642
Bernie doesn't want to see you sulking like that

395
00:29:58,043 --> 00:29:58,941
.This is correct

396
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
Can I help?

397
00:30:05,316 --> 00:30:07,183
.since you asked

398
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:09,633
...I want

399
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:15,488
When will we deal with people?
Who did this?

400
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:17,601
You won't deal with anything
.You are out of the team

401
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,173
What does this mean? -
It no longer concerns you.

402
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,800
We don't need you anymore.
This is nonsense, Marsh.

403
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:26,959
Who's going to run Bernie's team?

404
00:30:31,822 --> 00:30:32,499
Jenna)?)

405
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:37,894
Is this some joke?

406
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,604
You have disobeyed a direct order from your superior

407
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:42,983
.which cost us the mission, so you're off the team

408
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,305
I tried to save him, Marsh.
But you didn't save him.

409
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,713
It is our mission and our decision
.You are out of the team

410
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:51,266
That was Bernie's sacrifice, brother

411
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:54,184
Good death during the mission
.This would count

412
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:56,341
And you robbed him of that

413
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:58,803
.You made his sacrifice worthless

414
00:31:05,803 --> 00:31:06,730
.(Christmas)

415
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,785
.thanks for the support

416
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:19,961
.You've bought some time, buddy

417
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:39,108
Bernie hated cover bands

418
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:41,751
.I will be in touch

419
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,322
Nothing Bernie did was worthless

420
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:50,933
Do you understand, nothing?
Calm down, guys.

421
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,668
Don't talk about Bernie in front of me.
Not the right time and place.

422
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:57,082
Please, guys, calm down

423

You're lucky because I am

Are you going somewhere?

469
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,262
I'll go catch the guy
Who killed Bernie?

470
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:16,968
The only good thing about Bernie's death
.is the disclosure of this document

471
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,650
What does that mean exactly?
What is written here?

472
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:20,358
...Good

473
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:25,862
Bernie was part of an operation
Confidentiality between international agencies

474
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:30,253
When the operation failed, he decided all
Participants classify the document

475
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:32,593
Until everyone related to her dies

476
00:36:33,388 --> 00:36:36,008
So once Bernie died...
The document has been declassified

477
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,413
It gave us an idea of ​​Ocelot's identity

478
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:44,743
I want to join, I will accompany you

479

.You are not invited

.both

483
00:36:55,265 --> 00:36:57,245
There are many men on the mission

484
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:02,135
.I don't have the mood for that

485
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,577
I'll give you one of Hendrix's shows.

486
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:07,348
I will use some tricks -
Don't start with that -

487
00:37:08,244 --> 00:37:09,164
.It started

488

00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:16,849
And so is your brother

490
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,998
This has always been my favorite seat

491
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:30,425
Well, not like the cheap seats

492
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:39,744
You have to be more careful

493
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:40,924
He forced me to do so

494
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,013
Do an old soldier a favor

495
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,891
There are priorities

496
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:15,219
...I met Bernie

497
00:38:17,553 --> 00:38:19,507
When I was laid off from
.Special air service

498
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:23,708
I didn't have money, my situation was difficult

499
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:31,852
He bet on me when
No one wanted to bet

500
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:39,347
We will catch the person who
He did this to Bernie

501
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,159
.I promise you

502
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,545
.I know I can't accompany you

503
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,424
But I want you to take this

504
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:04,353
...Good

505
00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:07,916
I will be sure to convey (Rahmat) your regards

506
00:39:33,795 --> 00:39:35,677
"Get the signal"

507
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:36,768
"Tracking completed"

508
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:54,257
did you understand something? -
.I do not know what you say -

509
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:59,086
But why do you think it's called Lash? -
I don't know, but I would like to know.

510
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:01,074
She can flog me whenever she wants

511
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:04,486
.It's bigger than that, my dear

512
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:07,946
No, it's a Chinese bird
We use a finger and they run away

513
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,447
...But if it's convenient

514
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:14,361
What happened to your ears?

515
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:15,128
my ears?

516
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:17,854
Everyone knew I was
.wrestled in college

517
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:21,524
This is a common effect
.Sports is an ear injury

518
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,793
The cartilage separates from the skin
...and causes a small pocket

519
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:28,861
.I've never seen him so calm

520
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:33,445
He hasn't spoken anything since his breakup

521
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:44,303
Do you want to feel it?

522
00:40:44,328 --> 00:40:45,976
.It's not contagious, I promise you

523
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,422
South Asian Sea, secret location
“CIA

524
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:10,421
"Thailand"

525
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:28,209
What's News?

526
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,955
I'm looking for Disha

527
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:34,793
Disha yunai)?)

528
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:36,818
from?

529
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:40,220
A member of Squad 90
From the Thai Special Forces

530
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:42,577
Apparently, he has a boat
.Moored nearby

531
00:41:44,714 --> 00:41:46,220
.I don't know someone like that here

532
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:48,571
...But, if he owns a boat

533
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:50,857
The boats are down there

534
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:53,020
Not here!

535
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,670
.Thanks for help

536
00:43:05,594 --> 00:43:06,827
.Excuse me, my friend

537
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,621
Do you know the owner of this boat?

538
00:43:11,486 --> 00:43:13,352
I'm looking for someone named Disha

539
00:43:15,515 --> 00:43:18,368
I'm sorry, Disha left a long time ago

540
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:19,382
To where?

541
00:43:20,688 --> 00:43:23,522
To a place of tranquility

542
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,653
Is he dead?

543
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:31,686
.It's common these days

544
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:36,276
!Excuse me

545
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,783
I can't let you steal
This boat, sir!

546
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,977
What matters to you?

547
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:48,292
.It's just a boat, but it's not yours

548
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:55,005
Listen, I'll take this boat
With or without your consent

549
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:02,839
Why do you have Bernie's ring?

550
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:05,352
Bernie is dead.

551
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:09,572
And I want this boat to get there
For the people who killed him

552
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,983
I was looking for Disha

553
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:14,890
And from what Bernie said about him
It will be useful in the coming days

554
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:16,868
Bernie is dead.

555
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:23,767
I used to be Disha
The person you are looking for

556
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:26,006
But I left this person behind

557
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:28,197
If what you say is true

558
00:44:28,762 --> 00:44:31,008
I have to avenge Bernie

559
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:32,475
.definitely

560
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:53,251
Okay, everyone, listen up

561
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,819
The ship was hijacked
Thai Jintra

562
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:59,656
In the Andaman Sea, before
Our common bond (rahmat).

563
00:44:59,681 --> 00:45:01,358
Gentra changed course

564
00:45:01,383 --> 00:45:04,777
It is now sailing towards the coast
Vladivostok, Russia.

565
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,592
Because of the chaos in Libya

566
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:10,849
Rahmat possesses nuclear explosives.

567
00:45:11,232 --> 00:45:13,331
A barter transaction will take place on board the ship

568
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:18,095
Where they will get the rest of the materials
needed to build an active bomb

569
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,000
Of a nuclear nature, we cannot allow
This happens, okay?

570
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:26,703
We have obtained useful information
With Ocelot on board the Gentera

571
00:45:26,728 --> 00:45:30,252
So maybe this is the only chance
To reveal his identity

572
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:31,266
Or her identity

573
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:32,433
What did you say?

574
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,343
It may be a woman

575
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:39,397
.or her identity, yes, and we arrest him or her

576
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:41,690
You know, Bernie's death
.revealed the document

577
00:45:41,715 --> 00:45:44,241
Which revealed the person's name
Who works with Ocelot

578
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:46,333
A witness within the witness protection program

579
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:48,153
Russo will explain this topic

580
00:45:48,986 --> 00:45:51,032
His name is Fen Leung Bae

581
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:54,200
Ocelot's former partner
Who will be happy to report on the ocelot

582
00:45:54,225 --> 00:45:56,034
There's no way out for snitches, is there, Gunner?

583
00:45:56,058 --> 00:45:58,064
This is true, there is no salvation for informers

584
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,522
Now, no need to tell you about
The sensitivity of this task

585
00:46:00,547 --> 00:46:04,204
If the Russians hear that American forces...

586
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:07,468
Not only is it close
.But within Russian territory

587
00:46:07,493 --> 00:46:10,124
It will cause chaos on some level
World War III, okay?

588
00:46:10,149 --> 00:46:13,419
Therefore, this task
She does not have any American ID

589
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:14,689
.Complete denial of the mission

590
00:46:14,714 --> 00:46:16,551
If things get bad, you're on your own

591
00:46:16,576 --> 00:46:17,695
...And one last thing

592
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,675
Since you ruined the last mission
...in Libya without me

593
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,526
I will join you this time
Isn't that fun?

594
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:27,543
Jenna)?)

595
00:46:28,749 --> 00:46:30,936
.Okay, that's how it goes

596
00:46:31,637 --> 00:46:34,892
We will carry out this attack as two teams
Each team has a separate goal

597
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,069
We're on our way to land there

598
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:37,763
Alpha Team will secure the bridge

599
00:46:37,788 --> 00:46:39,349
While Bravo Team will...
.inspect the ship

600
00:46:39,374 --> 00:46:42,575
We will be identified and killed or captured
On (Ocelot) and (Rahmat).

601
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,294
We'll get the explosives
And nuclear components

602
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:47,518
And we're out of there, any questions?

603
00:46:51,673 --> 00:46:54,270
Is my explanation of the mission different from Bernie's?

604
00:46:54,295 --> 00:46:56,366
He probably would have said
"Let's go"

605
00:46:57,171 --> 00:46:58,658
.Okay -
.Good -

606
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,920
Let's go

607
00:47:08,803 --> 00:47:09,996
Is this an axe?

608
00:47:11,443 --> 00:47:12,833
No, it's just a snow shovel

609
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:17,463
This seems reasonable, however
It makes sense to you

610
00:47:23,593 --> 00:47:25,613
So what's your story?

611
00:47:27,103 --> 00:47:29,520
Bernie told me you were leaving
Band 90

612
00:47:30,036 --> 00:47:31,412
.I was the absolute type of killer

613
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:34,559
He's never met anyone faster or better

614
00:47:36,316 --> 00:47:39,986
You can kill in a limited number
Once upon a time, Christmas

615
00:47:40,952 --> 00:47:41,766
...every time

616
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,298
It gets easier

617
00:47:45,257 --> 00:47:48,963
.It becomes a drug for pain, for happiness

618
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,601
And for love

619
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,133
...with every person you kill

620
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:57,752
You will lose more of yourself

621
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:02,688
I should have stopped sooner
.to lose everything

622
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:25,035
I think I will benefit from my experience now

623
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:32,537
It's so quiet, something's wrong!

624
00:49:33,196 --> 00:49:34,503
Easy Day and Marsh will accompany me.

625
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:36,436
The rest will head to the starboard beam

626
00:49:36,936 --> 00:49:38,322
What's the starboard keel again?

627
00:49:38,347 --> 00:49:42,362
In the army we used to say
.right, left

628
00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:44,128
Starboard then

629
00:49:45,406 --> 00:49:47,525
- The gate is on the left and the crossbar is in the back.
I got it.

630
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,526
.let's move

631
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:26,065
I have a bad feeling about this.
Yes, where is everyone? -

632
00:50:26,886 --> 00:50:29,185
The nuclear bomb definitely exists
.on board

633
00:50:31,556 --> 00:50:33,516
Well, listen, I have bad news

634
00:50:33,641 --> 00:50:35,981
They already have uranium
With nuclear warheads

635
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,763
The ship is currently on board
.Active nuclear bomb

636
00:50:41,095 --> 00:50:42,808
We are about to reach the bridge

637
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:56,022
.It's like a ghost town

638
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,717
.Put the weapon down now

639
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:06,483
What a mess it would be here

640
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:08,925
"Libya first, now this?"

641
00:51:09,095 --> 00:51:11,115
Both times, someone...
.He knew we were coming

642
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:13,383
My information was correct.
Your information was crap.

643
00:51:13,408 --> 00:51:14,616
.You are a fool yourself

644
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:16,431
.Information may have leaked

645
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:18,938
We don't know you.
We have verified it -

646
00:51:18,963 --> 00:51:22,386
So maybe she's your new friend.
Damn you, Gunner.

647
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:25,253
You've already sold us on that one
Mission in Vilnius

648
00:51:25,278 --> 00:51:26,977
Did you think I would forget about it?

649
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:28,994
.Someone really sold us out

650
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:31,527
what about your friend?

651
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:33,568
.You sold it to be at the top

652
00:51:33,593 --> 00:51:35,248
.Calm down, she won't do that

653
00:51:35,363 --> 00:51:38,596
Why? To be at the top? -
.damn it -

654
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,830
Maybe the silent person in the corner

655
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:43,715
What's the matter, Galan?
Did the cat eat your tongue, my dear?

656
00:51:43,741 --> 00:51:45,734
Yes, he's hiding something!

657
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:47,656
.I never trusted him

658
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:53,442
Translation and modification
|| Muhammad Al Nuaimi and Dr. Ali Talal

659
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:02,547
Who is the leader? -
.I am the leader -

660
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:23,341
Take him

661
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,293
Screw it

662
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,235
.here we are

663
00:52:48,025 --> 00:52:49,178
.it's time

664
00:52:54,524 --> 00:52:57,884
I'll go first, I'll let you know when
.Be safe to follow me

665
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,755
.I'll stop here

666
00:53:00,954 --> 00:53:03,148
You might be of use to me.
.I can not do that -

667
00:53:04,206 --> 00:53:06,473
If I allow my nature
The old is to be revealed

668
00:53:06,903 --> 00:53:09,977
I don't know if I was
Able to hide her second.

669
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:17,634
.I understand

670
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,083
It was meant to be
There's a bloodbath here!

671
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,396
where are you?

672
00:54:22,612 --> 00:54:25,019
My shift is over, I'm going downstairs

673
00:54:41,274 --> 00:54:44,327
.Don't move, turn around slowly

674
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,493
Be clear my friend?

675
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,480
I don't move? Or turn around slowly?

676
00:54:50,267 --> 00:54:51,480
!Turn around!

677
00:54:51,713 --> 00:54:52,913
.very slowly

678
00:54:57,893 --> 00:54:59,747
!Oh, my God

679
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,670
Colin, you scared me, my friend.

680
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,899
(Colin)? Who is Colin?

681
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:08,274
Do not shoot, you must avoid the evil of that.

682
00:55:08,307 --> 00:55:10,287
You may get shot in the hand.

683
00:55:24,553 --> 00:55:26,273
Perfect timing, Mr. Marsh.

684
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:31,247
(Marsh)?

685
00:55:31,272 --> 00:55:34,066
The mission was a setup
The secret of our information is one person.

686
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:41,175
My requests are easy.

687
00:55:41,975 --> 00:55:43,441
Prisoner exchange.

688
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,521
I want your prisoner, Ben Leung Bae.

689
00:55:46,804 --> 00:55:48,578
A dear friend of my friend.

690
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,166
If you don't meet that...

691
00:55:51,221 --> 00:55:54,607
Mr. Marsh will show how serious I am.

692
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:57,959
So what will it be, Russo?

693
00:55:58,183 --> 00:56:00,210
I don't have the power.

694
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,065
I know you don't have the power.

695
00:56:02,471 --> 00:56:03,564
But...

696
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,097
I know someone who owns it.

697
00:56:18,092 --> 00:56:20,599
Let's go shoot down the last fake plane.

698
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:41,982
(Mercies).

699
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:44,667
You cunning snake.

700
00:56:50,738 --> 00:56:52,352
I can provide power for you.

701
00:56:52,616 --> 00:56:54,269
Ben Leung Bai is in your prison.

702
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:56,382
Your contact is Donald Ullman.

703
00:56:56,407 --> 00:57:00,951
Approval number: 2-2-5-7-9.

704
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:04,193
Gently and without messing around.

705
00:57:04,261 --> 00:57:08,008
You will decide whether this is the case
Whether the latest is forgotten or remembered.

706
00:57:35,779 --> 00:57:37,343
"Find a signal"

707
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:38,387
"Search complete"

708
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:22,022
Look at this man
I adore him and he is my role model.

709
00:58:22,953 --> 00:58:26,386
I will respect them enough.

710
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,356
I hope you meet him one day.

711
00:58:53,253 --> 00:58:55,193
This knife is not yours.

712
00:58:58,238 --> 00:58:59,857
Where are my comrades?

713
00:59:03,259 --> 00:59:04,639
Where are my comrades?

714
00:59:05,853 --> 00:59:07,413
Sir, we may have a problem.

715
00:59:07,438 --> 00:59:09,144
Contact with Payton and Tuck has been lost.

716
00:59:12,305 --> 00:59:14,545
Second floor, room 657.

717
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:15,829
Thank you very much.

718
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:22,556
(Gunner).

719
00:59:22,981 --> 00:59:24,148
What?

720
00:59:24,173 --> 00:59:25,493
This is what I like to use.

721
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:26,892
Answer me, Tuck.

722
00:59:26,937 --> 00:59:31,285
Maybe there's an intruder on board the ship.
Check the work of all staff.

723
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:33,479
What?

724
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:35,882
Tuck can't respond at the moment.

725
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:38,831
It's a little stressful.

726
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:42,506
where is he?

727
00:59:42,908 --> 00:59:46,121
Someone committed a sin and kept you alive.

728
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:48,047
But I came to care about this matter.

729
00:59:49,494 --> 00:59:51,574
Look who's striving to be a hero.

730
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:54,428
What a great thing to have you join us.

731
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:58,342
If you hope you will solve the problem
In Libya, I am sorry that you are late.

732
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:01,488
My men are coming to get you.

733
01:00:01,536 --> 01:00:04,549
It's up to me if you die young.

734
01:00:05,581 --> 01:00:08,028
Just like I did to your friend in Libya.

735
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:11,893
To correct, he was not my friend.

736
01:00:12,551 --> 01:00:13,917
Rather, he was my brother.

737
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:16,086
Then you can bring your army.

738
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:19,927
Bring what men you have
I will take care of them one by one.

739
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:21,417
Whenever I reach you

740
01:00:21,442 --> 01:00:23,986
I will make sure of the only way
To get off this ship.

741
01:00:24,096 --> 01:00:26,249
That it's broken into pieces.

742
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:10,707
Don't shoot, it's a bomb.

743
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:42,928
Okay.

744
01:02:17,722 --> 01:02:20,282
Do you see the intruder, Pavel?

745
01:02:21,168 --> 01:02:22,894
Yes sir.
- Where is it located?

746
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:24,629
Ground floor corridor.

747
01:02:30,348 --> 01:02:32,121
ship surface.
What?

748
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:40,857
Where are my comrades?

749
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:44,899
Where are my comrades?

750
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,727
Sir, we may have a problem.

751
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:49,504
Contact with Payton and Tuck has been lost.

752
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:54,825
Second floor, room 657.

753
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,109
Thank you very much.

754
01:03:01,526 --> 01:03:02,686
(Gunner).

755
01:03:03,073 --> 01:03:04,240
What?

756
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:05,679
This is what I like to use.

757
01:03:06,118 --> 01:03:07,492
Answer me, Tuck.

758
01:03:07,537 --> 01:03:11,885
Maybe there's an intruder on board the ship.
Check the work of all staff.

759
01:03:12,513 --> 01:03:13,633
What?

760
01:03:14,402 --> 01:03:16,482
Tuck can't respond at the moment.

761
01:03:17,806 --> 01:03:19,152
It's a little stressful.

762
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:23,006
where is he?

763
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,721
Someone committed a sin and kept you alive.

764
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:28,347
But I came to care about this matter.

765
01:03:29,655 --> 01:03:31,735
Look who's striving to be a hero.

766
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,721
What a great thing to have you join us.

767
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:38,702
If you hope you will solve the problem
In Libya, I am sorry that you are late.

768
01:03:38,772 --> 01:03:40,846
My men are coming to get you.

769
01:03:41,816 --> 01:03:44,729
It's up to me if you die young.

770
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,537
Just like I did to your friend in Libya.

771
01:03:50,049 --> 01:03:51,989
To correct, he was not my friend.

772
01:03:52,948 --> 01:03:54,342
Rather, he was my brother.

773
01:03:54,854 --> 01:03:56,074
Then you can bring your army.

774
01:03:56,471 --> 01:04:00,058

775
01:04:00,235 --> 01:04:01,622

01:04:01,761 --> 01:04:03,694
I will make sure of the only way
To get off this ship.

777
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:06,489
That it's broken into pieces.

778
01:04:49,526 --> 01:04:51,113
Don't shoot, it's a bomb.

779
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:23,526
Okay.

780
01:05:57,866 --> 01:06:00,500
Do you see the intruder, Pavel?

781
01:06:01,323 --> 01:06:03,143
Yes sir.
- Where is it located?

782
01:06:03,229 --> 01:06:04,789
Ground floor corridor.

783
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:12,129
ship surface.
What?

784
01:06:28,257 --> 01:06:30,677
Officers dining room,
Third deck.

785
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:13,173
Have a nice trip, my dear.

786
01:08:24,444 --> 01:08:25,897
It's in the stern of the ship.

787
01:09:17,332 --> 01:09:18,760
what are you doing here?

788
01:09:18,874 --> 01:09:20,254
I thought you were done with this life.

789
01:09:20,298 --> 01:09:24,570
Letting Bernie's friend pass away
Life is an insult to his memory.

790
01:09:26,452 --> 01:09:27,765
I like your look.

791
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:28,905
I thank you.

792
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,953
- Let's do it.
Good.

793
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,791
I think everything is closed here.

794
01:09:57,816 --> 01:10:01,277
- Yeah, I think that's nicely welded too.
- Okay, so what next?

795
01:10:02,193 --> 01:10:03,840
- “Drainage water” system.
What?

796
01:10:03,865 --> 01:10:04,886
Bilge water system.

797
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:07,988
In emergency cases, the water is drained
In dry areas of the ship.

798
01:10:08,963 --> 01:10:10,662
If we open it, we will be able to get out.

799
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,622
Let's open it.

800
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:15,254
Let's go.

801
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:20,438
- He's not moving.
- No, it must be wet.

802
01:10:20,722 --> 01:10:23,062
What?
-If it is wet, it will open.

803
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:28,171
-Is anyone urinating?
- I'm going to pee.

804
01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:30,383
I haven't peed since we parachuted out here.

805
01:10:40,193 --> 01:10:41,973
My privacy please.

806
01:10:51,576 --> 01:10:52,937
The greatness of the tongue.

807
01:10:55,013 --> 01:10:58,453
It is the only bone in the body
Man is not related to another greatness.

808
01:10:59,612 --> 01:11:02,525
It's in the mouth here
You can't talk without it.

809
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:08,059
But I'll take out the tongue bone
From Rahmat's lower mouth with my own hands

810
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,021
He put it in his friend's ass

811
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:13,584
I will make them apologize
They are soaked in their own blood.

812
01:11:14,363 --> 01:11:16,203
Bernie was my role model.

813
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:18,198
I can't speak.

814
01:11:18,366 --> 01:11:23,166
Because my mind is full
These cruel illusions.

815
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,086
And imagine I will turn it into a horrific reality.

816
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:32,534
It's better that you come back and not talk.

817
01:11:41,393 --> 01:11:42,547
I finished.

818
01:11:42,822 --> 01:11:43,982
Are there buyers?

819
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:46,661
Will this lead us to
The man who killed Bernie?

820
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:48,569
Okay.

821
01:11:49,244 --> 01:11:50,818
I will take his revenge.

822
01:11:57,126 --> 01:11:59,186
It turns out he loves the Golden Shower.

823
01:12:00,123 --> 01:12:03,323
Leung Bai is coming for you now.

824
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,273
I'm looking forward to getting my team back to life.

825
01:12:07,346 --> 01:12:08,606
certainly.

826
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,696
What is a person worth without his word?

827
01:12:11,247 --> 01:12:12,867
Be prepared to exchange.

828
01:12:13,423 --> 01:12:14,717
Get out!

829
01:12:16,085 --> 01:12:17,572
- This way.
Good.

830
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,460
- Your companions will be happy to see you.
- Probably not.

831
01:12:21,821 --> 01:12:24,028
Jenna will have to
Admitting that she needs me.

832
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:25,696
- Count to three.
Good.

833
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:26,831
three.

834
01:12:29,146 --> 01:12:31,419
- There's no one here.
both.

835
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:33,061
Where did they go?

836
01:12:35,502 --> 01:12:36,822
Do I smell urine?

837
01:12:38,043 --> 01:12:39,210
Okay.

838
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:42,508
We will remain calm until now
It's time to make noise.

839
01:12:50,648 --> 01:12:52,048
Lie down.

840
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,190
Is it time to hype?

841
01:12:58,101 --> 01:13:00,101
You are the one who should
Lay down, man.

842
01:13:00,999 --> 01:13:02,132
So what?

843
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,002
Don't forget that we are mercenaries.

844
01:13:09,823 --> 01:13:11,183
Don't tell me.

845
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,760
You are so happy to see me.

846
01:13:12,828 --> 01:13:15,374
In practice, you are no longer from
Mercenaries, Christmas.

847
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:16,810
Especially you.

848
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,292
gladly.
- As was just said.

849
01:13:19,317 --> 01:13:21,067
- Excellent timing.
- (Easy Day).

850
01:13:21,173 --> 01:13:22,553
Christmas).

851
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:26,460
Is this my axe?

852
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,107
Okay.
-Do you like it?

853
01:13:28,216 --> 01:13:30,729
-I'm starting to adapt to it.
- What delayed you?

854
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:35,152
Do you think I will believe it?
That you gave me your knife?

855
01:13:35,519 --> 01:13:38,853
Did you give her your knife?
- They say the romance is over.

856
01:13:38,878 --> 01:13:40,314
He put a tracking device in the knife.

857
01:13:40,443 --> 01:13:43,309
It's all part of the plan, sorry.

858
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:47,083
I feel exploited.

859
01:13:54,103 --> 01:13:55,796
Okay, let's go.

860
01:13:56,107 --> 01:13:57,753
Stay behind us, Gunner.

861
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:59,810
I like your hair.

862
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,851
- Who is your new friend?
- (Disha).

863
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:04,740
An old friend of Bernie's.
He has a status with those closest to him.

864
01:14:04,765 --> 01:14:07,015
Any friend of Bernie's is fine.
As concerned as I am.

865
01:14:07,046 --> 01:14:08,316
Rahmat kidnapped Marsh.

866
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:11,887
You should stay with Toll Road.

867
01:14:12,331 --> 01:14:13,864
I want you to take a look at something.

868
01:14:16,614 --> 01:14:18,294
This is a huge bomb.

869
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,242
The explosives we didn't get.

870
01:14:21,363 --> 01:14:22,663
What is this?

871
01:14:22,803 --> 01:14:24,503
Can you disable it?

872
01:14:24,578 --> 01:14:29,251
Prepared to explode in 27 minutes and reinforced
From neutralization and it has silver keys.

873
01:14:29,283 --> 01:14:32,650
There is only one way to disable it:
Find the key to disable the wireless connection.

874
01:14:32,675 --> 01:14:34,089
This is its last line of defence.

875
01:14:34,114 --> 01:14:38,193
The key is short-term and it is...
He owns it on board this ship.

876
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:39,845
- It is (mercy).
- It is (mercy).

877
01:14:40,756 --> 01:14:43,443
- Who is (Rahmat)?
- He's the one who killed Bernie.

878
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,430
We must have entered a protected area.

879
01:14:45,758 --> 01:14:48,758
They camouflaged the ship and made it
As if it were an American aircraft carrier.

880
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,344
With a nuclear bomb equipped
To blow up the Russian coast.

881
01:14:51,373 --> 01:14:53,126
This will spark a third world war.

882
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:55,634
The clock is ticking, let's take action.

883
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,718
The new place is the deck of the ship.

884
01:14:57,946 --> 01:15:00,013
Now it's all about stopping the bomb.

885
01:15:00,177 --> 01:15:02,877
We eliminate (Rahmat) forever.

886
01:15:03,405 --> 01:15:06,245
Can you make for us?
Something loud and wild?

887
01:15:06,337 --> 01:15:08,243
Does the Pope defecate in the forest?

888
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:10,265
No, the Pope doesn't defecate in the woods.

889
01:15:10,369 --> 01:15:13,023
Not near a bear
Why do you say these things?

890
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:20,897
what is that?

891
01:15:56,672 --> 01:15:57,892
Damn, it's a bomb.

892
01:17:03,246 --> 01:17:04,393
Screw it!

893
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:13,347
No problem.

894
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,554
You're welcome.

895
01:17:27,899 --> 01:17:29,266
It's great to be back.

896
01:17:33,538 --> 01:17:34,871
I'm with you.

897
01:17:35,555 --> 01:17:36,882
I thank you.

898
01:17:56,386 --> 01:17:57,459
You bastard!

899
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,009
I will take care of him.

900
01:18:33,426 --> 01:18:34,979
(Tulle).

901
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,174
We need help.

902
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,453
Can you kiss the wound to heal?

903
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:47,375
Maybe later, but I'm busy right now.

904
01:18:47,982 --> 01:18:49,082
I'll handle it.

905
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,986
Ready for prisoner exchange.

906
01:19:35,391 --> 01:19:37,038
Three minutes to land.

907
01:19:37,131 --> 01:19:38,991
Waiting for the exchange.

908
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:40,672
We continue as planned.

909
01:20:03,028 --> 01:20:04,394
What's the matter, Rahmat?

910
01:20:05,611 --> 01:20:07,358
I see you like to play with knives.

911
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,913
I don't play anymore.

912
01:20:09,043 --> 01:20:11,483
Give me the deactivation key
We'll get the whole thing over with.

913
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,194
Come and get him, hero.

914
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:27,567
Is this your strongest?

915
01:21:55,101 --> 01:21:56,320
both.

916
01:21:57,051 --> 01:21:58,758
This is my strongest.

917
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:06,682
Is that all?

918
01:22:06,707 --> 01:22:07,766
Okay.

919
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:14,604
Where is the kill switch?

920
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:16,495
You bastard!

921
01:22:16,663 --> 01:22:18,530
I don't have the kill switch.

922
01:22:19,897 --> 01:22:21,411
My boss has it.

923
01:22:23,988 --> 01:22:25,248
(Ocelot).

924
01:22:43,118 --> 01:22:44,691
Ben Leung Bai has arrived.

925
01:22:44,914 --> 01:22:47,248
He is the witness who can
Getting to know the ocelot.

926
01:22:56,552 --> 01:22:58,265
- Hello, Bay.
no. Oh, my God.

927
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:00,332
no.
- Goodbye, Bay.

928
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:09,488
Marsh is an ocelot.

929
01:23:09,654 --> 01:23:11,374
He had the key to disabling everything...

930
01:23:13,932 --> 01:23:15,200
This is for Bernie.

931
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:25,197
How long until the explosion?

932
01:23:25,932 --> 01:23:27,038
12 minutes.

933
01:23:27,108 --> 01:23:30,135
Well, we have 12 minutes to explode
The ship is like a firework...

934
01:23:41,998 --> 01:23:44,625
Marsh, I don't think you need it anymore.

935
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:46,237
Hey, Christmas.

936
01:23:46,861 --> 01:23:48,448
You are like genital warts.

937
01:23:48,609 --> 01:23:52,603
It pops up when he doesn't want it
There is no one in her and she refuses to leave.

938
01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:54,790
You got something I need, Marsh.

939
01:23:56,127 --> 01:23:57,334
I will come to get him.

940
01:23:57,507 --> 01:23:58,927
I think you understand

941
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:03,566
This device is just the thing
Which prevents a third world war.

942
01:24:03,591 --> 01:24:06,669
A conflict that will be fatal to many.

943
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:12,465
Which would be an order
Very comfortable for someone.

944
01:24:12,602 --> 01:24:14,762
And that person will be me.

945
01:24:15,001 --> 01:24:18,201
The mercenaries will bear all the blame.

946
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,200
So enjoy the show.

947
01:24:23,983 --> 01:24:26,430
-Kill them all.
- Take cover.

948
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:31,044
They all bowed down.

949
01:24:34,676 --> 01:24:37,082
We need to get off this ship
Otherwise we'll be French fries.

950
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:39,525
The pizza looks so opposite
Excellent idea now.

951
01:24:39,676 --> 01:24:41,263
We'll never get out of blast range.

952
01:24:41,563 --> 01:24:42,763
We won't make it in time.

953
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:49,216
Hey, don't die on my shift.

954
01:24:51,124 --> 01:24:52,764
We have to leave, he's bleeding.

955
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:55,337
An idea came to my mind.

956
01:24:55,622 --> 01:24:56,956
Can you take my boat?

957
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:58,577
He is behind us.

958
01:24:58,710 --> 01:24:59,853
It's a good idea.

959
01:24:59,919 --> 01:25:02,233
- Next time we'll start with that.
Okay.

960
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,496
Gunner, cover us with a shot
Fire, we're on our way out.

961
01:25:04,609 --> 01:25:05,969
I'll handle that.
They opened fire.

962
01:25:12,424 --> 01:25:15,278
I'll come back and we'll meet at the back of the ship.

963
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,120
Grenade.

964
01:25:21,406 --> 01:25:22,546
Let's get moving.

965
01:25:25,472 --> 01:25:27,632
I saw the girl on the other side.

966
01:25:44,714 --> 01:25:45,967
There's no one on the bridge.

967
01:25:46,098 --> 01:25:47,511
Start searching the ship.

968
01:25:57,772 --> 01:25:59,279
You're next, Toll Road.

969
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,724
Now it's your turn, Galan.

970
01:26:17,043 --> 01:26:18,202
Come forward.

971
01:26:28,003 --> 01:26:29,177
What?

972
01:26:32,036 --> 01:26:33,276
It doesn't matter.

973
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,904
Let's go.

974
01:26:53,858 --> 01:26:55,231
The task has priority.

975
01:27:01,864 --> 01:27:03,647
I have to turn this ship around.

976
01:27:07,414 --> 01:27:09,214
Maybe sacrifice can do that.

977
01:27:12,406 --> 01:27:13,873
The decision is his decision.

978
01:27:20,077 --> 01:27:23,303
Disha, you have to hurry or else
The Toll Road will be black.

979
01:27:35,281 --> 01:27:37,235
Check into the ward. They're walking around.

980
01:28:00,521 --> 01:28:01,774
Anchor.

981
01:29:21,228 --> 01:29:23,555
Bring the lifeboats here.

982
01:29:24,179 --> 01:29:26,119
Commander, we are returning to the sea.

983
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,852
Come on, hurry up.

984
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:35,954
These are genital warts.

985
01:29:35,979 --> 01:29:37,209
Kill him.

986
01:29:38,053 --> 01:29:39,580
More boats.

987
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,733
We need to get the ship back on course
Go up to the bridge and fix it.

988
01:29:46,002 --> 01:29:47,202
But sir...

989
01:29:47,903 --> 01:29:49,110
"Sir" what?

990
01:29:49,201 --> 01:29:51,000
The bomb will explode and we can't get up...

991
01:29:54,548 --> 01:29:55,935
What do you think about the promotion?

992
01:29:57,252 --> 01:29:58,498
Go up to the bridge.

993
01:29:58,868 --> 01:29:59,969
Kill him.

994
01:30:00,615 --> 01:30:02,383
Come to the bridge, hurry!

995
01:31:02,435 --> 01:31:04,455
Looks like we'll meet again
Soon, Bernie.

996
01:31:29,653 --> 01:31:30,686
Christmas).

997
01:31:40,023 --> 01:31:41,256
I'm here, Marsh.

998
01:31:42,749 --> 01:31:44,896
I see you called in the cavalry.

999
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:47,419
You can't get rid of me.

1000
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,790
All the fun is in the trying.

1001
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,053
Would you like to come down here and meet face to face?

1002
01:31:52,384 --> 01:31:53,630
Man versus man.

1003
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,827
Like the old days

1004
01:31:58,642 --> 01:31:59,762
Filled with fun.

1005
01:32:00,553 --> 01:32:01,666
I can't wait.

1006
01:32:01,697 --> 01:32:03,189
Don't you dare move.

1007
01:32:03,522 --> 01:32:04,735
I'm coming to you.

1008
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:11,166
Bernie tried to expose me
20 years ago but he failed.

1009
01:32:11,509 --> 01:32:14,169
But you are a skilled soldier.

1010
01:32:14,851 --> 01:32:16,330
You are a brilliant soldier.

1011
01:32:16,534 --> 01:32:19,714
But this is beyond your capabilities.

1012
01:32:19,747 --> 01:32:20,960
This matter...

1013
01:32:21,104 --> 01:32:22,624
This is an advanced stage.

1014
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:25,252
Bernie was proud of you.

1015
01:32:27,435 --> 01:32:29,142
You can tell him yourself.

1016
01:32:30,104 --> 01:32:31,870
Because you are about to join him.

1017
01:32:32,314 --> 01:32:33,621
What a wonderful thing.

1018
01:32:34,491 --> 01:32:36,011
Look what Santa brought me.

1019
01:32:48,066 --> 01:32:49,212
What is this?

1020
01:32:49,674 --> 01:32:50,861
(Bernie)?

1021
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:53,346
I'm tired of traditional methods.

1022
01:32:53,769 --> 01:32:56,183
You almost killed me.

1023
01:32:56,274 --> 01:32:57,754
You're welcome.

1024
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:02,459
faster.

1025
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:06,243
- What exactly is going on here?
-Hang on.

1026
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,353
- Where is the bomb?
- Her matter is settled.

1027
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,288
Wait, you're dead.

1028
01:33:18,562 --> 01:33:20,996
what is going on?
-I'm a little busy.

1029
01:33:50,422 --> 01:33:51,662
So what's the story?

1030
01:33:51,721 --> 01:33:56,101
25 years ago they had an operation
Dismissed and eight employees were dismissed

1031
01:33:56,126 --> 01:33:59,764
And you had to visit a wall
To discover a document of a certain type.

1032
01:34:00,028 --> 01:34:03,088
I brought Marsh out of hiding to...
I can prove it's an ocelot.

1033
01:34:03,447 --> 01:34:04,993
Why did you hide it from us?

1034
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:08,933
I did this task in the hope that...
You live and that's why it was personal.

1035
01:34:10,349 --> 01:34:11,649
That is it.

1036
01:34:46,663 --> 01:34:48,016
I need a drink.

1037
01:34:48,853 --> 01:34:50,060
Me too.

1038
01:34:51,661 --> 01:34:53,555
-You order drinks.
- I'm broke.

1039
01:34:53,738 --> 01:34:55,631
You had more fun dying.

1040
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,211
It's great to spend time with you again.

1041
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:02,554
But you can take a shower.

1042
01:35:14,261 --> 01:35:16,278
In memory of Bernie Ross, Chief.

1043
01:35:17,808 --> 01:35:20,572
- Toll Road, you owe me $20.
- Maybe you don't need glasses.

1044
01:35:20,605 --> 01:35:21,784
It's okay.

1045
01:35:21,984 --> 01:35:23,163
Good.

1046
01:35:23,753 --> 01:35:27,513
In the health of my friends who do not
They never give up in life.

1047
01:35:28,115 --> 01:35:29,328
Cheers!

1048
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:30,617
- For life.
- For life.

1049
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:31,774
Good health, comrades.

1050
01:35:32,301 --> 01:35:34,581
How about the cliche sentence on
On the ship, Christmas?

1051
01:35:34,692 --> 01:35:36,352
You mustn't do that again, Toll Road.

1052
01:35:36,377 --> 01:35:38,969
Maybe my sacrifice now.

1053
01:35:39,468 --> 01:35:40,688
Fuck you.

1054
01:35:40,752 --> 01:35:44,099
Stop making life difficult
It's amazing, my love.

1055
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:46,660
amazing.

1056
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:50,397
- Everyone is jealous of you because you are the most handsome.
I know that.

1057
01:35:50,809 --> 01:35:52,289
Oh the beauty of love.

1058
01:35:52,396 --> 01:35:53,662
Hello, Toll Road.

1059
01:35:55,388 --> 01:35:56,495
truly?

1060
01:35:58,738 --> 01:36:00,858
Bernie Ross is back from the dead.

1061
01:36:01,106 --> 01:36:04,593
You are the only one who can get out
From hell without being scratched.

1062
01:36:04,636 --> 01:36:08,149
You are like a legendary bird rising from the ashes.

1063
01:36:08,174 --> 01:36:09,864
- That's how you are...
one minute.

1064
01:36:09,946 --> 01:36:13,939
I am calm and talk to my role model
Can you give me some space, Easy Day?

1065
01:36:14,038 --> 01:36:16,678
Hey, Galan, do you have a minute of your time?

1066
01:36:16,788 --> 01:36:18,555
certainly.
-I have a small question.

1067
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:19,759
Help yourself.

1068
01:36:19,784 --> 01:36:20,972
Here he is.

1069
01:36:21,507 --> 01:36:23,293
- A scrap ring.
-I missed this.

1070
01:36:23,702 --> 01:36:25,428
thank you my friend.
Sorry.

1071
01:36:26,477 --> 01:36:27,747
I should know.

1072
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,081
Body of it?

1073
01:36:29,106 --> 01:36:30,187
exactly.

1074
01:36:30,212 --> 01:36:33,104
Have you ever wondered what...
Happened to Jumbo Shrim?

1075
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:40,477
Warning, the ground is very close.

1076
01:36:42,113 --> 01:36:44,264
Warning, there is no landing strip here.

1077
01:36:44,296 --> 01:36:45,791
Has risen.

1078
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:54,154
I did.

1079
01:36:56,746 --> 01:36:58,373
Yes offcourse.

1080
01:36:58,578 --> 01:37:05,846
