YOU COMPLETELY,

499
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,166
LET YOU SLEEP
WELL AT NIGHT?

500
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,627
WHAT, ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED?

501
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,963
WHO IS?

502
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,631
I AM.

503
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,970
SHE MEAN IT?

504
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,472
I HOPE SO.

505
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,475
WELL, THEN, YOU MAY
NOT HAVE WON IN VEGAS,

506
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,268
BUT YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

507
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,270
'CAUSE I GOT MONEY,
SECURITY, BUSINESSES,

508
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,524
BUT YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I JUST DON'T HAVE.

509
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,652
I GUESS THERE'S LIMITS
TO WHAT MONEY CAN BUY.

510
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,780
NOT MANY.

511
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,491
WELL, SOME THINGS
AREN'T FOR SALE.

512
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,536
SUCH AS?

513
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,205
WELL,
YOU CAN'T BUY PEOPLE.

514
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,542
THAT'S NAIVE, DIANA.

515
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,252
I BUY PEOPLE
EVERY DAY.

516
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,545
IN BUSINESS, MAYBE,

517
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,547
BUT NOT WHEN REAL
EMOTIONS ARE INVOLVED.

518
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,050
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING--
YOU CAN'T BUY LOVE?

519
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,885
THAT'S A BIT OF A CLICHE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

520
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,888
IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

521
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,891
IS IT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

522
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,392
I AGREE WITH DIANA.

523
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,352
YOU DO?

524
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,940
WELL, LET'S
TEST THE CLICHE.

525
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,862
SUPPOSE...

526
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:17,490
I WERE TO OFFER YOU
$1 MILLION...

527
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,621
FOR ONE NIGHT
WITH YOUR WIFE?

528
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,712
I'D ASSUME
YOU WERE KIDDING.

529
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,048
LET'S PRETEND I'M NOT.

530
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,092
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

531
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,764
HE'D TELL YOU
TO GO TO HELL.

532
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,349
I DIDN'T HEAR HIM.

533
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,229
I'D TELL YOU
TO GO TO HELL.

534
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,409
THAT'S A REFLEX ANSWER

535
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,912
BECAUSE YOU VIEW IT
AS HYPOTHETICAL.

536
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,790
BUT LET'S SAY THERE WERE
REAL MONEY BEHIND IT.

537
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,002
I'M NOT KIDDING.

538
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,503
A MILLION DOLLARS.

539
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,006
NOW, THE NIGHT
WOULD COME AND GO,

540
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,466
BUT THE MONEY
COULD LAST A LIFETIME.

541
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,469
THINK OF IT.

542
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,387
A MILLION DOLLARS.

543
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,017
A LIFETIME OF SECURITY,

544
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,184
FOR ONE NIGHT.

545
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,856
DON'T ANSWER RIGHT AWAY,

546
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,316
BUT CONSIDER IT--

547
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,277
SERIOUSLY.

548
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,031
WE'RE POSITIVE, O.K.?

549
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,037
WELL, THEN YOU'VE
ANSWERED MY QUESTION,

550
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,579
AND YOU'VE
PROVED YOUR POINT.

551
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,833
THERE ARE LIMITS TO
WHAT MONEY CAN BUY.

552
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,169
IT'S LATE, AND
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

553
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,046
BUT I HAVE
A MEETING.

554
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,840
MAY I HAVE ONE DANCE?

555
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,842
OF COURSE,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION.

556
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,177
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

557
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,179
I THINK YOU BETTER
GET ON TO THAT MEETING.

558
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:05,473
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON
YOUR NEXT BILLION.

559
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,683
UNDERSTOOD.

560
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,894
I WOULDN'T PART
WITH HER EITHER.

561
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,898
GOOD NIGHT.

562
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,497
CAN'T SLEEP?

563
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,460
NO.

564
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,797
ME, NEITHER.

565
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,140
I JUST KEEP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

566
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,852
IT'S SO WEIRD,
ISN'T IT?

567
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,149
YEAH.

568
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,324
DAVID, I THINK YOU
WANT ME TO DO IT.

569
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,039
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

570
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,042
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

571
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,963
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST TALK ABOUT IT.

572
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,258
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO IT.

573
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,473
BUT YOU'D
LET ME DO IT.

574
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,808
NO.

575
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:20,399
WHY? DO YOU
WANT TO DO IT?

576
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,819
NO...

577
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,491
BUT I WOULD.

578
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,827
I'D DO IT FOR YOU.

579
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,289
FOR ME?

580
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,219
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS.

581
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:52,057
THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS
MONEY COULD DO FOR US,

582
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,601
WHAT IT COULD DO
FOR OUR FUTURE.

583
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:59,814
YOU COULD
FINISH YOUR HOUSE.

584
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:03,026
YOU COULD
PAY YOUR DAD BACK,

585
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,195
GET RID
OF OUR DEBTS.

586
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:09,490
AFTER ALL, IT WOULDN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

587
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,492
IT'S JUST MY BODY.

588
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,203
IT'S NOT MY MIND.

589
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,538
IT'S NOT MY HEART.

590
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:21,460
YOU THINK WE COULD...
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

591
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,053
LOOK, WE BOTH SLEPT
WITH OTHER PEOPLE

592
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,055
BEFORE WE
WERE MARRIED, RIGHT?

593
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,472
YEAH.

594
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,976
SO WE'D JUST HAVE TO
LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT.

595
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,898
HUH! I SLEPT
WITH BUBBA ARUZIO,

596
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,899
FOR GOD'S SAKE,

597
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,026
IF I CAN
SLEEP WITH BUBBA,

598
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,527
I CAN SLEEP
WITH ANYONE.

599
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,113
YOU SLEPT WITH BUBBA?

600
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,822
COME ON, YOU KNEW.

601
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,575
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
WHEN DID YOU SLEEP WITH BUBBA?

602
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,077
WHEN YOU WERE OFF

603
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,162
SLEEPING WITH THAT SLUT
OLIVIA DAIGLE.

604
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,372
OLIVIA DEAGLE.

605
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,706
EXCUSE ME.
OLIVIA BEAGLE.

606
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,167
SHE WASN'T A SLUT.

607
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,668
LET ME IN.

608
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,170
SHE WASN'T A SLUT.

609
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,671
YES, SHE WAS.

610
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,467
NO, SHE WASN'T...
UNFORTUNATELY.

611
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,594
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

612
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,057
THANK GOD WE CAN
LAUGH ABOUT IT.

613
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,059
OH, YEAH...

614
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,228
THAT'S EASY TO SAY NOW--

615
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,478
AFTER.

616
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,695
WE JUST HAVE TO FORGET
IT EVER HAPPENED...

617
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,534
AND NEVER DISCUSS IT,
NOT EVEN ONCE...

618
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,624
I MEAN, BECAUSE NOTHING
WILL HAVE HAPPENED...

619
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,463
NOTHING THAT MATTERS,
ANYWAY.

620
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,807
WE HAVE A BRILLIANT SCRIPT.
REALLY, VERY SPECIAL.

621
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,184
MAJOR.

622
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,020
IT'S A COMEBACK VEHICLE
FOR DIANA ROSS.

623
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,396
BILLY RAY CYRUS.

624
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,440
IT'S KIND OF
A STAR IS BORN--

625
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:08,525
SO...YOUR FIRST SCREENPLAY
SOLD FOR HALF A MILLION.

626
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,028
SHOULD HAVE BEEN 2.

627
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,946
EXCEPT OUR LAWYER
CAVED IN ON US.

628
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,448
THAT WON'T
HAPPEN AGAIN.

629
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,034
WE'LL GET A LAWYER
THAT'S TOUGH, SAVVY.

630
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,454
SOMEONE THAT'LL STEP ON
HIS GRANDMOTHER FOR US.

631
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:20,746
[INTERCOM BUZZES]

632
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,041
DAVID MURPHY WOULD LIKE
TO SPEAK TO YOU.

633
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,541
HE SAYS IT'S URGENT.

634
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,002
OOH. PUT HIM
ON THE SPEAKER.

635
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,963
THIS IS AN OLD COLLEGE BUDDY.
ONLY TAKE A SECOND.

636
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,966
DAVEY, I'M IN A MEETING.
WHAT'S UP?

637
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,219
WE NEED YOU
TO CLOSE A DEAL.

638
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,345
WHAT KIND OF DEAL?

639
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:36,846
A BIG DEAL.
VERY BIG DEAL.

640
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,848
OOH. BIG DEAL.
GO ON.

641
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,351
WE'RE IN VEGAS
AT THE HILTON.

642
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:44,020
WE MET JOHN GAGE.
KNOW WHO HE IS?

643
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,522
SURE, I KNOW WHO HE IS.

644
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,023
HE'S A BILLIONAIRE

645
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,025
AND A MAJOR POON HOUND.

646
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,985
HE IS?

647
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,195
MM-HMM. GO ON.

648
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,572
HE OFFERED US, UH,
A MILLION DOLLARS.

649
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,074
A MILLION DOLLARS?

650
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,118
FOR WHAT, YOUR KIDNEYS?

651
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,330
FOR ONE NIGHT
WITH DIANA.

652
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,001
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

653
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,254
ONE NIGHT, LIKE...

654
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,713
YES.

655
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,260
COULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND?

656
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,016
L-L-LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

657
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,519
UM, HE OFFERED YOU
A MILLION DOLLARS

658
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,896
FOR A NIGHT
WITH YOUR WIFE,

659
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,898
AS IN YOUR WIFE

HOW COULD YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

663

HOW COULD YOU
NEGOTIATE WITHOUT ME?

664
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,367
NEVER NEGOTIATE
WITHOUT YOUR LAWYER.

665
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,035
NEVER!
FOR A WOMAN LIKE DIANA,

666
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,539
I COULD HAVE GOTTEN YOU
AT LEAST 2 MILLION!

667
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,541
OBVIOUSLY. YOU DON'T
WANT TO GET SCREWED

668
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,042
AND THEN SCREWED.

686
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,195

EVEN IF THE RELATIONSHIP
ISN'T CONSUMMATED.

691
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,042
YOU MEAN IF I'M IMPOTENT.

692
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,964
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR A LAWYER
TO COVER CONTINGENCIES.

693
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,383
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

694

695

696
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,809
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH THAT, EITHER.

697
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,936
CAN I HAVE YOUR PEN?

FOR MEN OF GOOD WILL

00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,744
TO...TAKE LEAVE
OF ONE ANOTHER.

01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,676
IT'S NOTHING.

827
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,761
YEAH.

828
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,679
LOOK, I'VE GOT
PEOPLE HERE.

829
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,182
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

830
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,559
SORRY.

831
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:47,561
I'M HERE FOR YOU NOW.

832
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:50,397
ALL RIGHT,
TWO ACRES ON ALTA LOMA.

833
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,773
ALTA VISTA.

834
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:54,318
VISTA. IT'S RIGHT HERE--
MURPHY PROPERTY.

835
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,194
WE'VE BEEN LATE
WITH PAYMENTS.

836
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,904
WE WANT
TO SETTLE UP.

837
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,698
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

838
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

839
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:05,203
WELL, THE MORTGAGE
IS TWO MONTHS IN DEFAULT,

840
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,372
AND IT APPEARS
THAT THE PROPERTY

841
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,625
IS IN CONTRACT
TO ANOTHER PARTY.

842
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,293
TO ANOTHER PARTY?

843
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,877
WHO?

844
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,379
THAT'S PRIVILEGED
INFORMATION.

845
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,881
WE CALLED SPECIFICALLY
FOR AN EXTENSION.

846
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,967
THE EXTENSION
EXPIRED TWO DAYS AGO.

847
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,470
IF YOU DON'T
MAKE A PAYMENT,

848
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:22,971
THE BANK CAN REPOSSESS.

849
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,641
WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE?
CAN THEY DO THAT?

850
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:27,309
UNDER THE TERMS
OF THIS AGREEMENT,

851
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,811
THEY DON'T HAVE TO
GIVE US A WARNING.

852
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,480
BUT IN FACT,
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE

853
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,064
TO CALL YOU ON THE 3rd,

854
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:36,151
AND A REGISTERED LETTER
WAS ATTEMPTED ON THE 4th.

855
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,153
APPARENTLY
THERE WAS NO ONE HOME.

856
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,155
Both: WE WERE OUT OF TOWN.

857
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,073
WELL, I AM SORRY,

858
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,158
BUT, UH...

859
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,410
YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE.

860
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,663
YOU SNOOZE,
YOU LOSE.

861
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,500
YOU SNOOZE,
YOU LOSE?

862
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,001
IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

863
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,252
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

864
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,296
YOU SNOOZE,
YOU LOSE.

865
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,964
THAT'S BULLSHIT!

866
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,552
THIS IS BULLSHIT, MAN!

867
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:03,554
DON'T DEAL
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

868
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,055
THEY SOLD US OUT!

869
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,931
THEY'LL
SELL YOU OUT, TOO.

870
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:54,104
WANT TO HELP ME
IN THE GARDEN?

871
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:58,108
O.K.

872
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,201
OUR TOMATOES
ARE LOOKING GOOD,

873
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,745
DON'T YOU THINK?

874
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,665
DAVID?

875
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,253
WHAT'S GRYPHON?

876
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,256
[CORRECTS PRONUNCIATION]
GRYPHON.

877
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,010
WHERE'D YOU
HEAR THAT NAME?

878
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,055
YOU HAVE
A BOX OF MATCHES.

879
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,977
WE SAID WE WOULDN'T
TALK ABOUT IT.

880
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:36,813
WELL, NOW I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

881
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,150
DON'T YOU?

882
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,152
NO.

883
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,488
D...

884
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,659
I THOUGHT I COULD
FORGET ABOUT THIS,

885
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,160
BUT I CAN'T,

886
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,827
SO I THINK...

887
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,331
MAYBE IF WE JUST
TALK ABOUT IT,

888
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,500
WE CAN PUT IT
BEHIND US.

889
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,257
GRYPHON'S A BOAT.

890
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,386
HE TOOK YOU
TO A BOAT?

891
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:09,471
IN NEVADA?

892
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,139
WE FLEW
TO SANTA BARBARA.

893
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,641
WHAT KIND OF BOAT?

894
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,142
A BIG BOAT.

895
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,644
AND THEN WHAT?

896
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,270
AND THEN NOTHING.

897
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,483
WHERE DID YOU
GET THE MATCHES?

898
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,527
HAVE YOU BEEN GOING
THROUGH MY BAG?

899
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,778
NO.

900
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:30,241
WHY? WHAT'S IN YOUR BAG?

901
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,661
I'M NOT GOING
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

902
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:34,788
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

903
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,929
WHAT?

904
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:16,514
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?

905
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:18,600
MY MOTHER.

906
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:22,145
AND, UH, WHAT DID MOM
HAVE TO SAY?

907
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:26,107
NOTHING.
SHE WASN'T THERE.

908
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,610
HOW COULD YOU
BE TALKING TO HER

909
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,445
IF SHE WASN'T THERE?

910
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,114
I WAS TRYING
TO TALK TO HER,

911
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,616
BUT I DIDN'T
REACH HER.

912
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,117
SHE WASN'T IN
AFTER 10:00?

913
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,786
NO, SHE'S NOT.
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

914
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:39,454
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
TALK TO HER YOURSELF?

915
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:46,837
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

916
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:53,635
WHAT IS THAT?

917
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:56,387
YOU KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

918
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:00,642
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS?

919
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:02,143
IN YOUR WALLET.

920
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,479
WELL, I'VE NEVER
SEEN IT BEFORE.

921
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,147
IT WAS RIGHT THERE IN
THE OLD SECRET COMPARTMENT.

922
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,398
DAVID, I DON'T EVEN
USE THAT.

923
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,399
HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING HIM?

924
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,818
NO, I HAVEN'T.

925
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,444
YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT HIM, CAN YOU?

926
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:12,821
YOU WON'T LET ME.

927
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:15,114
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
GOING THROUGH MY WALLET?

928
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,449
I DON'T TRUST YOU.

929
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:17,993
I DON'T
TRUST YOU EITHER.

930
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,161
WELL, THEN WE'RE EVEN.

931
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,505
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

932
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:32,507
I WANTED TO MAKE
SOMETHING GOOD

933
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:34,133
OUT OF ALL
WE'D DONE WRONG.

934
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,512
I DECIDED TO TRY AND BUY
OUR LAND BACK.

935
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,513
RECENT OFFERS?

936
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:39,514
OVER THERE.

937
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,682
O.K., ALTA VISTA.

938
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:42,308
I JUST NEED
THE GUY'S NAME.

939
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,311
I WANT TO MAKE HIM
AN OFFER.

940
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,146
I'LL GET KILLED
FOR THIS, DIANA.

941
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,773
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET IN TROUBLE.

942
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:51,150
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

943
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,527
543 ALTA VISTA.

944
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:53,987
THERE IT IS
RIGHT THERE.

945
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:54,988
BACK UP.

946
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:55,989
HERE WE GO.

947
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:59,158
543 ALTA VISTA.

948
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,911
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THAT.

949
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:03,830
THIS GUY'S NEVER GOING
TO SELL, DIANA.

950
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:06,332
I JUST SAW THIS GUY
ON TV.

951
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:46,748
YOU BASTARD!

952
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,625
YOU STOLE
OUR PROPERTY!

953
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,712
GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE A FRIEND OF MINE.

954
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,005
I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND.

955
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,549
DIANA ADVISED ME
ON A PIECE OF PROPERTY.

956
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,759
THAT'S BULLSHIT.
YOU'RE A LIAR.

957
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,260
YOU TOOK IT
I WANT IT BACK.

958
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,471
I TELL YOU WHAT--
CAN WE HAVE A LITTLE--

959
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,556
THAT'S O.K. EVERYTHING'S FINE.
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

960
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,644
EXCUSE ME.

961
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,858
I KNOW.

962
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:17,361
I'M TAKING IT OFF.

963
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,866
WAIT A MINUTE.

964
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,618
DID YOU JUST WANT
TO HURT ME?

965
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,120
NONSENSE. I THINK
YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

966
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,080
THAT WAS OUR HOUSE.
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

967
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:28,247
I GOT THERE FIRST.

968
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,291
I WANT YOU TO
SELL IT BACK TO ME.

969
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,709
YOU CAN'T
AFFORD IT.

970
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,168
HOW'S A MILLION DOLLARS?

971
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,671
THE PRICE IS 2.

972
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,548
IF I HAD 2, THE PRICE
WOULD BE 4, RIGHT?

973
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,176
I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY
AND I TOOK IT.

974
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,012
YOU HAD THE MONEY,
YOU HAD THE RIGHT INSTINCTS,

975
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:43,513
BUT YOU WERE TOO LATE,
THAT'S ALL.

976
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,722
I WANT YOU
TO WORK FOR ME.

977
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,223
YOU GO TO HELL.

978
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,809
LISTEN, I MEAN IT.

979
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:48,810
NEVER.

980
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:49,894
WHY NOT?

981
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,521
BECAUSE I HATE YOU.

982
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:53,314
NO, YOU DON'T.

983
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:56,026
YOU WISH
YOU HATED ME.

984
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,297
HEY, D.

985
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,345
YOU LOOK AWFUL.

986
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,849
WHERE YOU BEEN?

987
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:30,351
UH, I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT IT.

JUST...HEAR ME OUT.

1474
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:42,657
I THINK THE MISTAKE
I MADE IN VEGAS...

1475
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:44,157
WAS THINKING THAT...

1476
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:46,535
I COULD FORGET
WHAT WE DID.

1477

I...

1478
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:52,000
THOUGHT WE WERE
INVINCIBLE.

1479

THAT THE THINGS

THAT PEOPLE IN LOVE
DO TO EACH OTHER,

IT'S NOT BECAUSE
THEY FORGET.

1484
