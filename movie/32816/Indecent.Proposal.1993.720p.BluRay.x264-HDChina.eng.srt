1
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,346
Losing Diana was like losing a part of me.

2
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:43,186
I thought nothing could change the way we felt about each other.

3
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,230
I thought we were invincible.

4
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,611
Someone once said, if you want something very badly,

5
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,571
set it free.

6
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,699
If it comes back to you, it's yours forever.

7
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,120
If it doesn't, it was never yours to begin with.

8
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,502
I knew one thing, I was David's to begin with.

9
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,212
And he was mine.

10
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:15,927
You light up my life, you give...

11
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,553
We met in high school.

12
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,348
David was a senior and I was a freshman.

13
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,974
On Wednesdays, after glee club,

14
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,144
he'd drive me and my best friend home from school.

15
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,522
I used to watch him in the rear view mirror.

16
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,358
I fell in love with his eyes.

17
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,868
When I was 19, David proposed to me on the pier at Paradise Cove.

18
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,329
Our parents were against it.

19
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,416
They said we were too young and we really didn't know each other.

20
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,587
But David said that a life without risk is like no life at all.

21
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,006
So we eloped.

22
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:16,445
I graduated from architecture school and got a job at a small firm.

23
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,157
Diana helped support us by selling real estate.

24
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,121
I spent all of my free time working on a design of my own.

25
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,873
It summed up everything about architecture

26
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,125
that really mattered to me.

27
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,085
It was my dream house.

28
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,411
D.

29
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,958
Have I ever told you I love you?

30
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,045
No.

31
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,630
I do.

32
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,173
Still?

33
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,425
Always.

34
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,472
We had our differences.

35
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,058
He used to take his clothes off and leave them on the floor.

36
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,809
It made me crazy.

37
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,126
What do you think this is, huh? Leaving your shoes on the table?

38
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,545
-What is the problem here? -I don't need to do your fucking laundry!

39
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,630
Honey, I'll pick it up.

40
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,590
-You don't have to get violent on me. -What about this, huh?

41
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,634
-No, no. You put that down, honey. -Peanut butter sandwich...

42
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,344
That is serious. You're gonna hurt somebody with that.

43
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,762
I'm gonna hurt somebody, huh?

44
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,806
You're out of your mind.

45
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,891
Okay, now. Fine.

46
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,813
God damn it!

47
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,233
Come on, let's just relax.

48
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,276
Did I hurt you?

49
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,320
-No. I'm all right. -I'm sorry.

50
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,989
-Really? -Yeah.

51
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,532
You were kidding?

52
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,826
D, your pants are on fire.

53
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,121
You have no idea.

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,931
We never had much money, so for entertainment

55
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,893
David would show me architecture that moved him.

56
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,895
But sometimes I'd have to ask,

57
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,814
"Why are we looking at a stupid car wash?"

58
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,234
And he would just say, "No, not stupid.

59
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,945
"Don't just use your eyes."

60
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,698
He made me look at things differently.

61
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,869
David, this is a steal. It just came in to the office

62
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,662
and nobody even knows about it yet.

63
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,830
It's beautiful.

64
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,958
You could build a house here. You'll have made a name for yourself,

65
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,710
because of course, the house would be brilliant.

66
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,712
Because it would be a David Murphy house.

67
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:06,175
I found an incredible piece of property in Santa Monica by the ocean.

68
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,010
It was the perfect site for David's house.

69
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,095
How are we supposed to do it?

70
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,930
We'll borrow the money like everybody else.

71
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,808
I'm telling you, these leverage stock broker buyout guys,

72
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,267
you should see the junk they buy. Are you kidding?

73
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,104
They would go crazy for a house of yours.

74
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,606
It was brilliant,

75
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,526
even though I didn't understand a word of it.

76
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,820
We had to tighten our belts for the loan payments,

77
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,198
but it was our future. And I got to build my house.

78
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,913
And then the recession hit.

79
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,835
The real estate market dried up and I hadn't closed a sale in six months.

80
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,338
Construction fell to its lowest point in years.

81
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,633
People were being laid off everywhere. And I was one of them.

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,468
I feel really bad about this.

83
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,971
I don't understand. What happened?

84
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,974
The bank has called in the demand note.

85
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,642
Can they do that?

86
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:01,063
You don't have any income right now, so they could attach your assets.

87
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,567
What assets?

88
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,737
Your house.

89
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,366
You got to keep up those payments.

90
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,035
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,092
David, I'm scared.

92
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,140
We don't have any money.

93
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,643
What are we gonna do?

94
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,775
I'll wait tables or drive a cab or something.

95
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,288
Hey, I'll take care of you.

96
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,959
Make it go away.

97
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,054
I was desperate. We stood to lose everything.

98
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,224
The house I'd been building, even our own home.

99
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,436
I swallowed my pride and borrowed $5,000 from my father.

100
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,647
It wasn't enough.

101
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,691
We needed $50,000.

102
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,331
-D. D, D. -What?

103
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,999
-Get up, get dressed. -What's the matter?

104
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,335
-I got an idea. Come on. -What?

105
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,087
-What time is it? -Chop chop.

106
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,823
Hi, how you doing? Okay.

107
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,450
Cigars. Cigarettes. Lighted yo-yos.

108
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,831
-Oh, yeah! -Oh, my God!

109
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,501
Oh, honey. That's the spirit! Keep them coming.

110
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,713
$50,000, that's what we want. We're winners!

111
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,849
Boom, skinny, skinny! Put some money in the kitty.

112
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,060
Eleven. Winner.

113
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,563
We got a shooter now, folks. We got a shooter.

114
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,273
A lucky, lucky lady shooter.

115
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,608
Keep it coming. Stack it, don't rack it!

116
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,365
If I haven't gotten nine, Denzel Washington ain't fine.

117
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,035
Hard six! Hard six!

118
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,579
-All bets set, folks. -Who's the one?

119
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,684
And I have a necklace...

120
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,689
Why don't you put it on?

121
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,191
It suits you.

122
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,404
Well, I can't afford it.

123
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,574
That's too bad.

124
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,534
Yep.

125
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,000
I really think you ought to have the dress.

126
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,544
Let me buy it for you.

127
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,339
-You want to buy me this dress? -Yeah.

128
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,927
-Why? -I've enjoyed watching you.

129
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,097
You've earned it.

130
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,101
No, I haven't.

131
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,648
The dress is for sale. I'm not.

132
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,322
Boom, skinny, skinny!

133
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,159
Pull in that. Pull in that stack.

134
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,994
We got a new shooter, now. Coming out.

135
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,746
Coming out to seven or eleven.

136
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,873
Roll them now, girlfriend.

137
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,333
Seven!

138
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,551
Come on now! Come on.

139
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,138
-I can't lose. I'm up over $9,000. -Oh, my God!

140
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,932
I can't believe it!

141
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,981
-$9,000. -My God, it's so great!

142
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,192
This is my wife D. These are my girls.

143
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,444
They're gonna be moving in. All right.

144
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,613
Come on. Kiss them.

145
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,201
Bets, please.

146
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,912
'Cause we're winners!

147
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,790
Boom, skinny, skinny!

148
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,341
Did I ever tell you I love you?

149
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,551
-No. -I do.

150
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,177
-Still? -Always.

151
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,910
Five thousand. This little pile here, you guessed it.

152
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,745
Five more, D.

153
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,582
What do you think this is? Five more.

154
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,876
Play with it, roll around with it, enjoy yourself.

155
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,587
Oh, my!

156
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,009
And the grand total is...

157
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,098
$25,040.

158
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,893
So, we're half-way there, like in an hour.

159
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,356
I figure about two hours tomorrow,

160
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,192
-we'll be home free. -Come here.

161
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,044
What?

162
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,216
I love you.

163
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,680
I know that.

164
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,851
No, I mean, even without the money.

165
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,100
Let's split the three and the six for me.

166
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,356
-That's right. Why don't you split them? -Fifteen.

167
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,486
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

168
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,119
Come on, black. Come on, black. Here we go.

169
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,913
Yes!

170
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,382
Double zero.

171
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,218
No more bets, please.

172
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,057
Come on, black. Here we go.

173
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,102
Yes, we won!

174
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,465
$4,100, we said we wouldn't go below $5,000.

175
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,717
Do you want any more coffee?

176
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,552
No, thank you.

177
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,155
Tails, we quit. Heads, we go for it.

178
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,468
Two out of three.

179
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,972
Last call for wagers.

180
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,183
No more bets.

181
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,436
Okay. I'm feeling lucky. I say we put it on red.

182
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,147
All of it. Red.

183
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,943
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

184
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,114
We can do this, huh? D?

185
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,701
I'm gonna put it all.

186
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,538
I'm putting it on red.

187
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,457
Okay.

188
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,148
-No, it's black! It's black. -What are you doing?

189
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,609
-It's black. -What are you doing?

190
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,115
No, no, it's red. It's red.

191
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,409
Go with your instincts. Right?

192
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,537
-No more bets. -Oh, come on, man. Come on, red.

193
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,709
Got to get it. Got to get it.

194
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,171
Come on, red. Come on, red.

195
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,641
Too late, young lady.

196
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,515
Place your bets. Bank side, player side.

197
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,142
All set? Cards, please.

198
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,606
Turning for the players.

199
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,275
Passes to the right, please.

200
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,199
Player draws nothing.

201
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,751
And set.

202
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,755
Player side, banker side.

203
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,842
-Any other bets? -Who's that guy?

204
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,593
That's John Gage.

205
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:30,181
He's a damn billionaire. That's a rich son-of-a-bitch, right there.

206
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,934
He's down over a million dollars already.

207
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,687
You see those little gold things he's playing with?

208
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,397
$10,000 a piece.

209
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,484
Every time he lays one down, ten thousand big ones.

210
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,278
Look at him, how cool he is.

211
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,571
That son-of-a-bitch must get more pussy

212
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,072
than you can shake a stick at.

213
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,866
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything.

214
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,200
-Player wins. -What are y'all doing here?

215
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,660
-You gambling? -No.

216
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,579
It's about time.

217
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,663
Y'all married?

218
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,206
-Let's go. -Yeah.

219
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,416
Stick around and gamble a little.

220
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,335
Excuse me. Excuse me.

221
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,882
Would you mind lending me your wife?

222
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,550
Is that your wife?

223
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,968
Excuse me?

224
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,221
For luck.

225
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,308
You'd have to ask her.

226
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,810
May I?

227
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,355
-Go for it. -I don't think it's a good idea.

228
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,648
I think we should just go.

229
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,233
Just for a moment?

230
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,736
-I'll go. -Go ahead. It might be fun.

231
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,821
What do we got to lose?

232
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,156
Well?

233
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,824
Why don't you go in and see what happens?

234
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,326
Yeah. Go ahead.

235
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,828
We'll be right here backing you up.

236
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,580
Thank you.

237
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,125
See if you can get a little of that money from him.

238
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,753
Do you think she'll ever come back?

239
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,006
I'm just bullshitting you.

240
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,551
Have a seat.

241
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,261
I've been losing all day long.

242
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,971
Then you appeared and I won my first hand.

243
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,848
You brought me luck.

244
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:58,311
I'd say that's a sign. Wouldn't you?

245
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,859
-Would you like a drink? -No, thank you.

246
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,361
Candy?

247
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,783
Place your bets.

248
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,868
-Bank side, player side. -$100,000.

249
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,537
Any other bets?

250
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,124
-Just like that? -Just like that.

251
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,583
All bets set.

252
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,002
$20 tie-in.

253
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,340
Not like that.

254
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,467
Sorry.

255
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,223
All bets set. Cards, please.

256
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,147
-Turning for the players. -Now, what we want...

257
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,151
What we need is a nine.

258
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,535
We don't like that.

259
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,746
Player draws nothing. Cards for the bank, please.

260
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,083
Bank's a winner with a natural eight. Pay the bank.

261
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,339
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.

262
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,091
Do you like cards?

263
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,594
Not especially.

264
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,846
Wish I'd asked you sooner.

265
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,055
Dice?

266
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,808
Yeah, I guess.

267
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,563
Sam.

268
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,648
Mr. G?

269
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,152
One.

270
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,487
Excuse me, Mr. G.

271
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,041
Well, maybe I should go.

272
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,250
This shouldn't take too long. Here we go.

273
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,252
-What? -This.

274
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,136
Now,

275
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,182
I hope you find this interesting.

276
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,476
Pit. Tadross.

277
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,313
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it's here now.

278
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,357
Yes, sir.

279
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,488
I understand.

280
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,908
Yes, sir. Thank you.

281
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,743
Goes for $1 million.

282
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,245
It's a bet.

283
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,626
Here you are, Mr. G, $1 million.

284
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:55,822
Bet it all.

285
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,888
Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven. This time it is a come out roll.

286
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,016
Hone those skills now. Get them down.

287
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,392
Pick two.

288
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,027
Now, just throw a seven.

289
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,031
If you want to throw an eleven, that's all right, too.

290
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,788
Aren't you forgetting something?

291
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,185
Seven!

292
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,614
The winner is seven. Everyone.

293
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,077
Think I ought to quit now?

294
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,204
I think I should.

295
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,083
Credit my account.

296
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,710
Excuse me. Excuse me.

297
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,880
Sweetie, it was amazing. Incredible. Oh, my God.

298
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,382
Unbelievable.

299
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,842
Hi. John Gage.

300
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,470
-Oh, hi. David Murphy. -Hi, David.

301
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,307
Congratulations. This is my wife, Diana. I guess you met.

302
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,559
-Hi, Diana? Hi. -Diana.

303
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,479
Thank you, both.

304
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,940
Very generous of you, David. Are you staying at the hotel?

305
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,775
Oh, no. Actually, we were just leaving.

306
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,235
-You're leaving? -Yes, we're on our way out.

307
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,654
No, no, no, no. Don't do that. We got to celebrate.

308
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,948
Let me arrange a room for you here.

309
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,742
-That's very nice, but... -No, I... I insist.

310
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,745
Please. It's the least I can do. Okay?

311
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,790
Really, just sign for it. Anything you want.

312
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:14,877
There's some lovely shops off the lobby. Have you seen them?

313
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,257
Let's go.

314
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,603
How about that?

315
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,692
Wow.

316
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,613
Hey, D, what do you think? Godfather?

317
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,205
You won a million dollars today.

318
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,499
He won it.

319
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,668
Honey, you won it for him.

320
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,136
This feels nice.

321
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,474
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

322
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,933
-Okay. -Okay.

323
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,612
Hello. William Shackleford.

324
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,322
Hi. David Murphy.

325
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,202
For Mrs. Murphy, from John Gage.

326
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,498
-Well, thank him for us. -I'll do that.

327
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:37,043
Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering tonight in his suite at 9:00.

328
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,669
If you could find the time in your schedule,

329
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,588
he'd be most pleased.

330
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,468
-Look what you got. -What?

331
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,137
A gift from Gage.

332
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,098
Really?

333
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,101
Well, open it up.

334
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,240
That's $5,000.

335
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,493
How do you know that?

336
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,121
I... I saw it in the store downstairs.

337
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,961
-Lucky for him you like black. -Yeah.

338
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,558
No past, no future, you just check into a hotel and start all over again.

339
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:03,105
I'd stick them under the sheets...

340
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,275
That's strange, am I right?

341
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,549
Who is that guy, Shackleford?

342
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:35,638
Someone who works for me. Someone I trust.

343
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,103
He killed someone once.

344
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,611
Tell me, where do you see yourself in, say, ten years?

345
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,826
Well, I wouldn't mind being a billionaire like yourself.

346
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,870
No... Nice shot. I mean, beyond money.

347
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,666
What would satisfy you completely, let you sleep well at night?

348
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,711
What, are you saying you're not satisfied?

349
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,045
Who is?

350
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,423
I am.

351
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,177
She mean it?

352
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,930
I hope so.

353
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,891
Well, then, you may not have won in Vegas,

354
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:21,976
but you're a lucky man.

355
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,521
'Cause I got money. I got security. I have businesses,

356
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,023
but you have something that I just don't have.

357
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,402
Well, I guess there's limits to what money can buy.

358
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,446
Not many.

359
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,283
Well, some things aren't for sale.

360
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,702
Such as?

361
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,038
Well, you can't buy people.

362
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,460
That's naive, Diana. I buy people every day.

363
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,753
Well, in business, maybe,

364
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,547
but not when real emotions are involved.

365
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,382
So, what are you saying? You can't buy love?

366
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,343
That's a bit of a cliche, don't you think?

367
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,512
It's absolutely true.

368
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,890
Is it? What do you think?

369
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,185
-I agree with Diana. -You do?

370
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,814
Well, let's test the clich.

371
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:18,115
Suppose I were to offer you $1 million

372
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,412
for one night with your wife.

373
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,128
I'd assume you're kidding.

374
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:35,299
Let's pretend I'm not. What would you say?

375
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,138
He'd tell you to go to hell.

376
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,600
I didn't hear him.

377
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,187
I'd tell you to go to hell.

378
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,203
That's a reflex answer because you view it as hypothetical.

379
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,665
But let's say that there were real money behind it.

380
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,503
I'm not kidding. A million dollars.

381
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,675
Now, the night would come and go, but the money could last a lifetime.

382
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:21,679
Think of it. A million dollars.

383
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,935
A lifetime of security, for one night.

384
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,315
And don't answer right away. But consider it.

385
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,277
Seriously.

386
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,780
We're positive, okay?

387
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,078
Well, then, you've answered my question.

388
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:50,416
And you've proved your point. There are limits to what money can buy.

389
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:54,503
It's late, and I hate to admit it, but I have a meeting.

390
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,964
May I have one dance?

391
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,092
Of course, with your permission.

392
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,678
You know something, I think you better get on to that meeting.

393
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,890
You don't want to miss out on your next billion.

394
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,435
Understood. I wouldn't part with her, either.

395
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,355
Good night.

396
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,956
Can't sleep?

397
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,001
No.

398
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,713
Me, neither.

399
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,639
I just keep thinking about it.

400
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,769
It's so weird, isn't it?

401
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,606
Yeah.

402
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,699
David, I think you want me to do it.

403
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:56,000
What are you talking about? Don't be ridiculous.

404
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,005
Well, maybe we should just talk about it.

405
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,465
Well, I don't want you to do it.

406
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,099
-But you'd let me do it. -No.

407
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,274
Why, do you want to do it?

408
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,819
No.

409
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,282
But I would.

410
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,452
I'd do it for you.

411
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,080
For me?

412
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,302
I can't believe we're even talking about this.

413
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,639
Think about what this money could do for us.

414
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,100
What it could do for our future.

415
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,691
You could finish your house. You could pay your dad back.

416
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,527
Get rid of our debt.

417
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,990
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

418
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:15,287
It's just my body. It's not my mind. It's not my heart.

419
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,752
You think we could do something like that?

420
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,304
Look, we both slept with other people before we were married, right?

421
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,514
Yeah.

422
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,768
So we'd just have to look at it like that.

423
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,233
I slept with Bubba Aruzio, for God's sake.

424
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,776
If I can sleep with Bubba, I can sleep with anybody.

425
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,653
You slept with Bubba?

426
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,280
-Come on, you knew. -No, I didn't know that.

427
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,658
When did you sleep with Bubba?

428
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,121
When you were off sleeping with that slut Olivia Daigle.

429
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:01,166
-Olivia Deagle. She wasn't a slut. -Oh, excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

430
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,419
I'm telling you. She wasn't a slut.

431
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,754
-Yes, she was. -No, she wasn't.

432
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,090
-Yes, she was. -No, she wasn't.

433
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,134
Unfortunately.

434
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,515
Thank God we can laugh about it.

435
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,476
Yeah.

436
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,104
That's easy to say now. But after...

437
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,445
We'd just have to forget it ever happened.

438
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,285
And never discuss it. Not even once.

439
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,958
I mean, because nothing would have happened.

440
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,379
Nothing that matters, anyway.

441
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,391
We have a brilliant script, really, very special.

442
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,435
-Major. -It's a vehicle,

443
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,396
-a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross. -Billy Ray Cyrus.

444
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,191
-It's kind of A Star is Born. -So...

445
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,359
Your first screenplay sold for half a million.

446
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,903
-Should have been two. -Yeah, except our lawyer,

447
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,362
son-of-a-bitch, caved in on us.

448
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,572
-That won't happen again. -No.

449
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,074
See, we're gonna get a lawyer that's tough, a lawyer that's savvy...

450
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,369
Someone who would step on his grandmother for us.

451
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,581
Mr. Green, a David Murphy would like to speak to you.

452
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,249
He says it's urgent.

453
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:25,918
Put him on the speaker.

454
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,879
This is an old college buddy of mine. It'll only take a second.

455
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,380
-Jeremy? -Davey.

456
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,174
I'm in the middle of a meeting. What's up?

457
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,676
Well, listen, we need you to close a deal.

458
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,638
-What kind of deal? -A big deal, a very big deal.

459
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,306
Big deal. Go on.

460
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,017
We're in Vegas, at the Hilton.

461
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,686
We met John Gage. You know who he is?

462
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,730
Sure, I know who he is. He's a billionaire,

463
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,857
and a major poon hound.

464
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,526
He is?

465
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,945
Go on.

466
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,322
He offered us a million dollars.

467
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,909
A million dollars? For what? Your kidneys?

468
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,746
For one night with Diana.

469
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,753
What do you mean? One night, like...

470
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,921
Yes.

471
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,677
Could you excuse me for a second?

472
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,434
Let me get this straight.

473
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,562
He offered you a million dollars for a night with your wife?

474
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,564
As in your wife, Diana?

475
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,775
And you agreed to it?

476
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,279
I don't know what to say, man. How could you do something like that?

477
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,281
How could you negotiate without me?

478
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,117
Never negotiate without your lawyer! Never!

479
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:44,329
For a woman like Diana, I could have got you at least two million!

480
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,958
Obviously! You don't want to get screwed, and then screwed.

481
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,794
Hey, stay. Please. This is damage control.

482
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,004
Two seconds. Eat cookies.

483
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,547
-There's cookies coming. -No. You don't understand.

484
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,965
-We've heard enough. -You're hired.

485
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,758
You are. You're our man. We love your style.

486
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:57,843
-Great. -Thank you.

487
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,469
Gladys, check the gentlemen's schedules.

488
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,305
And call me next week. Wednesday? Wednesday good?

489
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,931
-Great. Okay. -See you then.

490
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:04,182
-Thanks for coming. -No, thank you.

491
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,351
-No, thank you. -Thank you.

492
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,439
Okay, David, before we go any further, let's...

493
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,942
Let's get the moral issue out of the way.

494
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:16,153
-Leave that to us. -No, I was referring to my fee.

495
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,988
I get five percent.

496
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,826
Do you want to elaborate on the verification clause?

497
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,536
Verification...

498
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,498
That means you pay even if the relationship isn't consummated.

499
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,251
You mean if I'm impotent.

500
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,922
It's important for a lawyer to cover contingencies.

501
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,676
I can live with that. The John Garfield clause?

502
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,137
That's if you die in the act.

503
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,728
I have no problem with that, either. Can I have your pen?

504
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,821
-You're pretty good, you know? -Thank you.

505
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,366
You should come work for me.

506
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,295
We have a deal.

507
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:24,304
A million dollars will be deposited in your casino account in the morning.

508
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,103
So...

509
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,189
So...

510
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,608
So...

511
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,113
You can go.

512
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,408
Gentlemen, I think it's time for men of good will

513
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,702
to take leave of one another.

514
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:17,691
It's all right. I don't bite.

515
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,237
So...

516
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,408
What, should I go undress?

517
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,707
You know, cheer up. You got to find a more creative way

518
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,791
to think about this, okay?

519
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,626
Just look at it like an episode of The Dating Game

520
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,629
that went a little bit, you know, awry or something like that.

521
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,299
Ladies and gentlemen,

522
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:46,720
we wish to welcome you to our jamboree.

523
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,807
...I couldn't believe it. I know we could've gotten two million.

524
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:52,893
Here's your Buddha.

525
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,896
Davey, no point getting out the crying towel.

526
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,357
You got a million bucks, buddy. A million bucks.

527
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,822
She's an amazing woman. She really is.

528
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:07,866
Couldn't have gotten $500 for my girlfriend.

529
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,910
Not that I'd do that.

530
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,621
But it's okay that you did.

531
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,373
This is a different situation and she agreed to it.

532
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,042
You got to remember that.

533
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,544
And it's not like it's hard duty or anything like that.

534
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,588
Hell, he's a great looking guy.

535
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,674
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

536
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,260
Maybe not.

537
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,305
Hey, buddy!

538
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,860
Come on!

539
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,122
Come on. Come on.

540
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,418
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

541
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,142
D? It's me.

542
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,481
D! D!

543
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,319
Where is she? Where's my wife?

544
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,031
Where is she?

545
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,786
Diana!

546
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,205
Please!

547
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,915
Where did she go? What happened to her?

548
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,750
-Where'd they go? -Up. Up.

549
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,836
-Up! Up where? -Up.

550
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,629
Helicopter.

551
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,191
D!

552
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,529
D!

553
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,409
D! D!

554
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:20,624
D!

555
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,634
They sent for me. They said you were ready.

556
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,025
Come here.

557
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,633
You missed a button.

558
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,892
Thank you.

559
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,313
I want to show you something.

560
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,081
What happened?

561
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,500
The lights went out.

562
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,213
I see that. Why?

563
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,551
Look.

564
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,726
Can you turn those off, too?

565
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,232
I'm working on it.

566
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,864
Who made the decision?

567
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,037
-We both did. -No.

568
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,583
Do it for your own reasons, or don't do it.

569
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,628
You don't know him.

570
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,755
I know he didn't stop you.

571
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,591
If you were mine,

572
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,264
I wouldn't share you with anyone.

573
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,647
You have no right to judge David.

574
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,319
You're the one who has to buy women.

575
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,989
You think I have to buy women?

576
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,370
Why me, then?

577
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:17,832
I bought you because you said you couldn't be bought.

578
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,210
I can't be bought.

579
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,630
We're just gonna fuck, as I understand it.

580
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,009
You might enjoy it.

581
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,095
Don't bet on it.

582
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,684
I think I will.

583
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,441
Heads, we do.

584
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,443
Tails, we call the whole thing off,

585
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,654
turn the boat around, go home. No hard feelings.

586
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,948
What do you say?

587
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,660
It's your party.

588
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,539
It's my lucky dollar.

589
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,501
So I can't lose.

590
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,982
Trust me.

591
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:29,487
Nothing's gonna happen you don't choose.

592
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,665
-I love you. -I love you.

593
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,016
I told myself it was over.

594
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,936
Like a dream that vanishes in the morning light.

595
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,648
And in time, enough time, I would forget.

596
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:27,039
Yeah.

597
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,418
All right.

598
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,463
Yeah.

599
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,924
Yeah, a little fixer-upper south of Wilshire.

600
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:38,676
It's nothing. Yeah.

601
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,555
Look, I've got people here.

602
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,598
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

603
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,476
Sorry, I'm here for you now.

604
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,731
-All right. Two acres on Alta Loma... -Alta Vista.

605
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,775
Vista. It's right here. Murphy property.

606
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:57,153
Yeah. We've been a little late on the payments.

607
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,030
We want to settle up.

608
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:02,950
-I don't think that's possible. -What do you mean?

609
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:05,328
Well, the mortgage is two months in default.

610
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,582
And it appears that the property is in contract to another party.

611
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,420
-To another party? Who? -That's privileged information.

612
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,340
How can that be? We called specifically for an extension.

613
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,134
The extension expired two days ago.

614
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,429
You don't make a payment, the bank can repossess.

615
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,223
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

616
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,310
Under the terms of this agreement, they don't have to give us a warning.

617
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,480
But in fact, an attempt was made to call you on the third,

618
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,857
and a registered letter return receipt requested,

619
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,359
was attempted on the fourth.

620
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,444
Apparently, there was no one home.

621
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,237
-We were out of town. -We were out of town.

622
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:44,533
Well, I am sorry, but you snooze, you lose.

623
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,454
You snooze, you lose.

624
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,458
-"You snooze, you lose"? -It's an expression.

625
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,668
You snooze, you lose. Oh, that's beautiful.

626
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,380
You snooze, you lose. That's bullshit!

627
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,675
-This is bullshit, man. -David...

628
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,344
Hey, don't deal with these people.

629
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,305
They sold us out, they'll sell you out, too.

630
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,020
Hey, want to help me in the garden?

631
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,857
Okay.

632
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,369
Our tomatoes are looking good, don't you think?

633
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,165
David?

634
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,044
What's Gryphon?

635
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,047
Gryphon.

636
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,260
Where did you hear that name?

637
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,555
You have a box of matches.

638
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,477
We said we wouldn't talk about it.

639
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,354
Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

640
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,942
-Don't you? -No.

641
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:49,200
D, I thought I could forget about this, but I can't.

642
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:56,165
So I think maybe if we just talk about it, we can put it behind us.

643
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,049
Gryphon is a boat.

644
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,845
He took you to a boat? In Nevada?

645
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:13,307
-We flew to Santa Barbara. -What kind of boat?

646
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,601
-A big boat. -And then what?

647
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:17,895
And then nothing.

648
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:24,026
Where did you get the matches? Have you been going through my bag?

649
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,152
No.

650
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,741
Why? What's in your bag?

651
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:34,620
I'm not gonna talk about this. I'm not gonna do it.

652
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:12,885
What?

653
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:16,513
Who you talking to?

654
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,891
My mother.

655
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,186
And what did Mom have to say?

656
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,398
Nothing. She wasn't there.

657
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,400
I thought you said you were just talking to her.

658
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,903
How could you be talking to her if she wasn't there?

659
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:34,615
Well, I was trying to talk to her, but I didn't reach her.

660
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,660
-She wasn't in after 10:00? -No. She's not.

661
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,829
If you don't believe me, would you like to talk to her yourself?

662
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,835
What is the matter with you?

663
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,594
-What is that? -You know what it is.

664
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,601
-Where did you get this? -In your wallet.

665
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,353
Well, I've never seen it before.

666
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,689
Well, it was right there in the old secret compartment.

667
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,773
David, I don't even use that.

668
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,441
-Have you been seeing him? -No, I haven't.

669
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,110
You can't stop thinking about him, can you?

670
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,029
-You won't let me. -Can you, D?

671
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:15,781
What are you doing going through my wallet, anyway?

672
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,990
-I don't trust you. -Well, you know what?

673
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,200
I don't trust you, either.

674
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,202
Well, then we're even.

675
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,588
I had to do something.

676
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,717
I wanted to make something good out of all we'd done wrong.

677
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,428
I decided to try and buy our land back.

678
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,681
Okay, Alta Vista...

679
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:45,352
I just need to find out the guy's name. I want to make him an offer.

680
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:47,896
I'll get killed for this, Diana.

681
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,065
I don't want you to get in trouble. I really appreciate it.

682
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:53,360
-543, Alta Vista... -Wait, there it is. There it is right there.

683
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:54,903
-Okay. Okay. -Back up.

684
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:58,157
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

685
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,745
Oh, my God, look at this. This guy's never gonna sell, Diana.

686
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,748
He's one of the... I just saw this guy on TV.

687
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,683
I'm not going back in there.

688
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,208
You bastard! You stole our property!

689
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,128
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a friend of mine...

690
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,963
I'm not your friend.

691
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,049
Diana advised me on a piece of property in Santa Monica.

692
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,927
That's bullshit. You're a liar. You took it, and I want it back.

693
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,054
I tell you what, can we have a... Excuse me. That's okay.

694
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,639
No, everything's fine. Everything's under control.

695
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,265
Very well, sir.

696
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,352
Excuse me.

697
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,736
I'm taking it off.

698
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,491
Wait a minute.

699
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:23,951
Why? What, did you just want to hurt me?

700
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,577
Nonsense. I think you're wonderful.

701
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,287
That was our house. How could you do that?

702
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:30,374
-I got there first. -I want you to sell it back to me.

703
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:33,252
-You can't afford it. -Well, how's a million dollars?

704
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,170
The price is two.

705
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:37,297
Oh, and if I had two, the price would be four, right?

706
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:39,591
Listen, I saw an opportunity and I took it.

707
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,051
You had the money, you had the right instincts,

708
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,554
but you were too late. That's all.

709
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,348
-I want you to work for me. -You go to hell.

710
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,017
-Listen, I mean it. -Never.

711
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,310
Why not?

712
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:53,522
-Because I hate you. -No, you don't.

713
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,733
You wish you hated me.

714
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:18,839
Hi, D.

715
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,887
You look awful.

716
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,641
-Where you been? -I'll tell you about it.

717
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:32,603
I'm just gonna have some wine first.

718
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,107
Do you want some?

719
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,341
So, where you been?

720
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:12,184
Last night I stayed up for hours trying to figure a way out of this mess.

721
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,188
And today?

722
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,860
And today I saw Gage.

723
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,622
Thank you for your trust, David. And for listening.

724
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:36,416
-Did you fuck him? -No.

725
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,793
But you wanted to, right?

726
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,545
David, I met him in broad daylight, surrounded by a bunch of rich assholes.

727
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,089
I don't believe you.

728
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:44,716
David, he bought our property, okay?

729
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:46,927
That's why I went to see him.

730
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:50,013
I just wanted to find some way to get it back.

731
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:54,351
You have no reason to be jealous. I hate him.

732
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,645
D, you gotta tell me what happened on that boat.

733
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,481
-David, don't do this. Don't do this! -Tell me what happened on that boat.

734
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,775
-Why? -Because I want to know.

735
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,696
All right, I'll tell you. You know what? The man was a fucking stallion, David.

736
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,698
Is that what you want me to say? We did it all night long.

737
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,825
-Does that do it for you? -Is that the truth?

738
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,743
The truth? You don't want the fucking truth.

739
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,704
You want me to lie. You want me to say he's awful.

740
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,205
So, you know what? I'm gonna tell you he's awful

741
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,623
and you won't believe me. How can I win?

742
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,750
Just tell me the truth, D.

743
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,628
It was sex, David. Just sex.

744
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:23,422
Not love. Just sex.

745
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,174
-And was it good sex? -Don't do this, David.

746
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,260
Can you just tell me that, D? Was it good?

747
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,845
What are you hesitating for? Just tell me.

748
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,764
Was it good? Was it good? Was it good?

749
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,766
Yes.

750
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,112
David.

751
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:54,327
D, don't you tell me it was just sex

752
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:56,204
because you were attracted to him all along.

753
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,290
You know that's bullshit.

754
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,791
David, I did it for you.

755
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,585
Don't you tell me you did it for me.

756
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,628
-You did it for yourself. -That's not... That's a lie.

757
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,422
-You were dying to do it. -That's a lie.

758
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:08,341
I would never do this for myself. It was all for you.

759
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:11,720
Don't lie to me! You were attracted to him!

760
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,659
I knew something like this was gonna happen.

761
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:20,997
I guess you make a deal with the devil, and eventually you pay the price, right?

762
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:23,041
Thanks, Jeremy.

763
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,210
Coming from the man who closed the deal with the devil,

764
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,670
that's very comforting.

765
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:33,385
Green. Oh, hi, Di.

766
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:35,804
I'm not here.

767
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,349
Yeah, he's right here. You want to speak to him?

768
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,686
-No, I don't want to talk to him. -Look, sweetie,

769
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:48,567
he loves you, you love him. I mean, you got to try and work this out.

770
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,235
It's all pretty simple, right?

771
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,195
This is a deal even I can't screw up.

772
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:57,576
Tell him he can keep the money. I don't want any of it.

773
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:10,380
Davey, she said she doesn't want the money.

774
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:14,217
Well, I don't want the money, either.

775
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,771
I'll take it. I mean, nobody else wants it.

776
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,630
-Hey. -Hi, Diana.

777
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,898
The next few weeks without David felt like months.

778
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,526
I got very good at staring at walls.

779
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:19,491
Diana. Diana. The recession has ended.

780
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:23,745
There's a fellow out there, he wants to see $10 million homes.

781
01:16:23,955 --> 01:16:25,497
There is a God.

782
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,711
Find someone else.

783
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:35,632
Find someone else? Are you nuts?

784
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:37,676
Do you know what the commission is on $10 million?

785
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,053
-I can't do it. -You have to do it.

786
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,222
You're the best one I have.

787
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:46,017
You're the only one I have. The others are all on caravan.

788
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,441
I'm sorry, Mr. Langford, I can't.

789
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:59,030
Diana, I would never dream of forcing you to do anything against your will.

790
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,659
Except this one time.

791
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,330
Now, move your ass or you're fired.

792
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,965
If you think this is going to work, you underestimate me.

793
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,367
You are truly beautiful.

794
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,747
What do you think you're doing?

795
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,500
Looking for a house.

796
01:17:57,131 --> 01:18:00,342
Well, there's Bel Air, Holmby Hills, Benedict Canyon, Pacific Palisades.

797
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,178
-Where would you like to go first? -Paris.

798
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,599
1120 Bel-Air Road, please.

799
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:19,277
The ceilings are French Gothic.

800
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:21,696
Renaissance paintings as you can see.

801
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:23,865
Parquet floors throughout.

802
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,201
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

803
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,244
This is the master bath.

804
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,627
Why didn't you return any of my calls?

805
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,964
-Do you like it? -No.

806
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,729
-$30 million minimum. -You think?

807
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:57,065
-I know. -Well, let's look at it.

808
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,110
-It's not for sale. -Everything's for sale.

809
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,184
This is your house, isn't it?

810
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,605
Do you like it?

811
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,363
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

812
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:51,161
What do you think it needs? Tell me. Honestly.

813
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,583
I think it needs a life.

814
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:03,298
I think it needs furniture, and maybe a couple of dogs and flowers.

815
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:04,966
It needs you.

816
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:12,015
Just forget it. It just won't work.

817
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,558
Why not?

818
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:18,855
Because from where we started, we've got nowhere to go.

819
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,732
You don't know that.

820
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,777
I never started this way either.

821
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,240
I need you.

822
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:34,704
No.

823
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:37,373
You collect things.

824
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,086
Don't you?

825
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,423
Sometimes.

826
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:52,889
Yeah.

827
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:02,667
Even if you were extremely rich, and extremely smart,

828
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,128
-can you be President? -No.

829
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,213
-You couldn't be President? -No.

830
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:08,506
Why not?

831
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:13,094
I took a second job teaching citizenship just to keep myself busy.

832
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:20,226
-Ju, where were you born? -I was born in Seoul, Korea.

833
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,061
Okay, where was she born?

834
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:25,940
-She was born in Seoul, Korea. -She was born in Seoul, Korea.

835
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,818
Now, Ju, do you have any children born here?

836
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:36,534
Where were you born, Miguel?

837
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:39,787
Sorry.

838
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,874
Welcome back. Where were you born?

839
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,209
-Cuba. -Cuba.

840
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:48,254
So, how do we say Cuba in America?

841
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:52,342
Cue-ba. Hi.

842
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:57,430
-What are you doing here? -Isn't this a citizenship class?

843
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,265
-Yes. -Can I sit in?

844
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,268
It's full.

845
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,396
Okay.

846
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:12,528
Cuba.

847
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:14,238
Cuba. Thank you.

848
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,007
Okay. I have a question for you.

849
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:37,762
Excuse me. Is there something you'd like to share with us?

850
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,307
I was just saying that you're an amazing woman.

851
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:48,856
And... And beautiful.

852
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,526
And talented.

853
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,655
And I am crazy about her.

854
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:07,583
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

855
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,502
I'm trying like hell.

856
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:12,839
-I think maybe you should go. -You want me to go?

857
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:14,132
-No. -No.

858
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:19,846
Nice people.

859
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:24,600
-They want the dream. -Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

860
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,023
You have chalk on your face.

861
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,155
I have something I want to show you.

862
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,130
I didn't know whether you liked big ones or little ones.

863
01:24:57,176 --> 01:24:59,677
You're so beautiful. Come here.

864
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,850
I didn't have much time to do anything else.

865
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,022
But it's a start.

866
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:25,870
Dance?

867
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:30,374
I should go.

868
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,799
I remember once when I was young

869
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,843
and I was coming back from someplace, a movie or something,

870
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:42,720
I was on the subway.

871
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:49,352
There was a girl sitting across from me, and she was wearing this dress

872
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:53,773
that was buttoned clear up right to here.

873
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,072
She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

874
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,993
And I was shy then.

875
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:10,331
So when she would look at me, I would look away.

876
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:16,087
Then, afterwards, when I would look back,

877
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,922
she would look away.

878
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:24,929
Then I got to where I was gonna get off and I got off, the doors closed,

879
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:30,351
and as the train was pulling away,

880
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:35,439
she looked right at me and gave me the most incredible smile.

881
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,903
It was awful.

882
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,531
I wanted to tear the doors open.

883
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:48,202
I went back every night, same time, for two weeks.

884
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,666
But she never showed up.

885
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,254
That was 30 years ago

886
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:04,552
and I don't think that there's a day that goes by that I don't think about her.

887
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,806
I don't want that to happen again.

888
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:17,440
Just one dance?

889
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,406
I want a word with you, Gage.

890
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,452
See, what you don't know is, we got a secret, me and Diana.

891
01:30:58,537 --> 01:31:00,204
We're invincible.

892
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:03,082
Diana, I need to talk to you.

893
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,292
Maybe tomorrow would be a better time to talk.

894
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,670
Well, maybe tomorrow would be a better time, you think...

895
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,839
Hey, Johnny-baby, I got a suggestion for you.

896
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,173
You know that emblem you got,

897
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:14,885
the Gryphon, the eagle,

898
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:16,220
yeah, I don't think it's a good idea.

899
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,638
I got a better idea.

900
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,306
Shall I...

901
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,016
How about the cuckoo?

902
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:24,395
You know, because, it's... I'm talking to you for a second...

903
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,815
The cuckoo is an interesting bird because it doesn't have its own nest,

904
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,777
so it moves into the nest of other birds and it destroys their eggs.

905
01:31:31,862 --> 01:31:33,612
David, stop. Just...

906
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,617
You don't love me anymore?

907
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,168
Have I ever... Have I ever told you I love you?

908
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:53,132
Have a nice dinner.

909
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:56,677
Help him.

910
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,472
Go inside.

911
01:34:34,461 --> 01:34:36,712
You've done a lot since USC.

912
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:43,218
First in your class, the AIA award, Prix de Rome.

913
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:45,763
Yeah.

914
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,308
Why would you want this job?

915
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:51,894
Well, I want to work.

916
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,442
Over-qualified.

917
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,778
Fine. Exploit me.

918
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:40,401
Great architecture is only gonna come from your passion.

919
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,986
And even that won't assure you a job.

920
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:47,741
Louis Kahn, died in a men's room in Penn Station.

921
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:49,868
For days, no one claimed the body.

922
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:51,787
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

923
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,997
The money men did not weep.

924
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,209
Because the great ones are impossible to deal with.

925
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,627
They're a pain in the ass,

926
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:02,089
because they know that if they do their jobs properly,

927
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:04,758
if they just this once get it right,

928
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:09,179
they can actually lift the human spirit, take it to a higher place.

929
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:17,020
-What is this? -A brick.

930
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:22,109
-Good. What else? -A weapon.

931
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:30,200
Louis Kahn said even a brick wants to be something.

932
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:41,128
A brick wants to be something.

933
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,382
It aspires.

934
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:57,186
Even a common, ordinary brick wants to be something more than it is.

935
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:05,777
It wants to be something better than it is.

936
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,705
And that is what we must be.

937
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,252
See you on Friday.

938
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:37,518
A brick wants to be something, huh? I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

939
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,270
-What are you doing here? -I missed you.

940
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:43,065
-I missed you, too. -Thanks.

941
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:52,282
-How you doing? -I'm good. Getting it together.

942
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:00,707
She wants a divorce.

943
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:04,878
She wants her freedom,

944
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:10,926
and if you don't contest it, you get everything.

945
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:14,596
The land, the money, everything.

946
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,516
Where is she?

947
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,437
Hi, everybody.

948
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:29,778
Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly. Goodbye, everybody.

949
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:31,947
You may wonder what you're doing here,

950
01:38:32,031 --> 01:38:36,076
sitting in the blazing sun as the smell of the zoo

951
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,744
wafts past your nostrils.

952
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:40,998
The reason you're here is because you are loaded.

953
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:44,251
May I say how brilliant it is to see so many people

954
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:47,588
with an interest in the preservation of endangered species.

955
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:51,258
Every year we have this unique way of making money for the cause.

956
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,509
We auction animals.

957
01:38:52,594 --> 01:38:54,761
We bid as high as we possibly can,

958
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:57,264
and the money goes to sponsor these lovely beasts.

959
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,224
Let's start the show with a bang.

960
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:02,102
We've got a superstar as our first animal.

961
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:05,355
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

962
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:09,192
The animal itself is far too big and angry to bring along.

963
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:10,819
Look at this guy.

964
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:16,158
Thousands and thousands of pounds of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

965
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:19,286
Weighs slightly less than the average school bus.

966
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,164
And look at that magnificent beastie.

967
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:26,585
To put him in a better light, to relieve you of some serious money...

968
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:29,129
Thank you very much.

969
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:32,049
...we have a kissy-kissy picture.

970
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:34,760
Isn't that nice?

971
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:39,473
Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't even dream

972
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:43,018
of starting the bid below $10,000.

973
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:45,479
-Now, I know that's a lot of money... -Thirty.

974
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:49,900
$30,000, ladies and gentlemen.

975
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:54,946
Call me a sentimental old fool, do I hear 35?

976
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:58,408
-Thirty five. -$35,000.

977
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:00,994
-Forty. -$40,000. Ladies and gentlemen.

978
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:03,497
-45,000. -45,000.

979
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:07,042
-Fifty. -$50,000.

980
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,003
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.

981
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:15,008
$50,000 once, $50,000 twice, ladies and gentlemen...

982
01:40:15,468 --> 01:40:16,885
$1 million.

983
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:27,312
-I'm sorry? -$1 million.

984
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,193
Did you say $1 million, sir?

985
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,070
Yeah.

986
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:38,281
Ladies and gentlemen, $1 million.

987
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:43,787
Would anybody care to top that, ladies and gentlemen?

988
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:45,330
I didn't think so.

989
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:48,709
In that case, sir, I believe you're the proud owner of a hippo.

990
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:50,460
Congratulations.

991
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:05,892
Hello, Diana.

992
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:09,062
Ladies and gentlemen, the next animal to take the stand is an ostrich.

993
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:11,732
I really wanted you to have that money.

994
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:14,651
And I really wanted you to have that hippo.

995
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,404
But we love them in Scotland...

996
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:20,574
Maybe you two would like a moment alone.

997
01:41:25,747 --> 01:41:28,749
So, can we hear a bid of, maybe, a million?

998
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,838
-45,000. -$45,000.

999
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,047
So...

1000
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:40,761
-How are you? -I hear you...

1001
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,095
-Sorry, go ahead. -...are teaching. Go ahead.

1002
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:43,889
-I'm sorry. -Go ahead.

1003
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,057
Yeah. I'm teaching.

1004
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:50,604
You know, it doesn't pay much,

1005
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,690
but at least I get to talk about architecture.

1006
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,610
You know how I love to talk about architecture.

1007
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,361
Oh, my goodness.

1008
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:01,656
Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen. It's just a little shower.

1009
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:05,994
Please, ladies... A check book makes an ideal umbrella.

1010
01:42:06,204 --> 01:42:09,289
Do we have a dolphin? We have dolphins.

1011
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:11,583
How about tropical fish?

1012
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:14,795
I know, you're running home for more cash. I get it.

1013
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:18,131
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, you can find the money.

1014
01:42:18,216 --> 01:42:20,342
Oh, to hell. I'm gone.

1015
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:32,646
Listen, I have to talk to you about what happened, D.

1016
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,398
-Don't. Don't. -No, no, no. I have to.

1017
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:37,150
Just hear me out.

1018
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:43,156
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

1019
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:46,868
was thinking that I could forget what we did.

1020
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:51,748
I thought we were invincible.

1021
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:57,128
But now I know that the things that people in love do to each other,

1022
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:58,713
they remember.

1023
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:03,051
And if they stay together, it's not because they forget,

1024
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:05,178
it's because they forgive.

1025
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:13,520
I was just...

1026
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:19,860
I was just so afraid that you wanted him.

1027
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:25,156
No, actually I was afraid that you were right to want him.

1028
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:32,289
I thought he was the better man.

1029
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:40,130
I know now he's not.

1030
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:44,009
He's just got more money.

1031
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:18,269
I think we should talk.

1032
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:20,647
I am very happy.

1033
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:26,027
Shackleford, have you ever seen me like this?

1034
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:29,572
I can't say that I have.

1035
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:33,743
-Diana is the reason. -Enough for any man.

1036
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:37,205
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

1037
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:43,586
-You are the best of them. -The best of them?

1038
01:45:45,006 --> 01:45:48,216
-You said I'm the best of them? -You are.

1039
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:53,930
I don't understand.

1040
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:58,476
Shackleford, could you explain it to her?

1041
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:02,647
What? I could do that, sir.

1042
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:08,194
But somehow I feel Miss Murphy would rather hear it directly from you.

1043
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:09,904
Okay. All right.

1044
01:46:11,115 --> 01:46:14,784
She's the best of the million dollar club. Obviously.

1045
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:20,874
-Million dollar club? -Now you got it.

1046
01:46:23,753 --> 01:46:25,587
You told me you had never done that before.

1047
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:28,423
How many members would you say there are?

1048
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:30,467
-Members? -Yeah.

1049
01:46:32,428 --> 01:46:34,554
-Worldwide? -Yeah.

1050
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:38,975
I think a couple of dozen.

1051
01:46:39,977 --> 01:46:42,979
Remember the one that wouldn't stop hiccupping?

1052
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:44,064
What?

1053
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,732
The waitress from Oklahoma.

1054
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:49,069
Every time you came near her, she would convulse with the hiccups.

1055
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:53,364
Yeah, I had forgotten.

1056
01:46:54,116 --> 01:46:55,658
Quite a night.

1057
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:01,790
See, the best thing of it is that you know if you're sexually compatible

1058
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,918
right from the start.

1059
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:18,515
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

1060
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,754
Thank you, John.

1061
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,137
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

1062
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:06,312
Here.

1063
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,152
For luck.

1064
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:16,906
Yeah.

1065
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:22,912
-Take care of him. -Sure.

1066
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:33,882
What was all that about?

1067
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:37,927
I wanted to end it.

1068
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:46,102
She never would have looked at me the way she did at him.

1069
01:49:37,363 --> 01:49:41,491
Seven years ago, David proposed to me on the pier at Paradise Cove.

1070
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:46,329
I wanted to go there to remember, and start over.

1071
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:55,940
Have I ever told you I love you?

1072
01:51:06,285 --> 01:51:07,327
No.

1073
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,207
I do.

1074
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:20,673
Still?

1075
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:26,346
Always.
