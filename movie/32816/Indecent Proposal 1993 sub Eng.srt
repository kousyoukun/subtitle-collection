1
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,347
<i>Losing Diana was like
losing a part of me.</i>

2
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:43,186
<i>I thought nothing could change
the way we felt about each other.</i>

3
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,231
<i>I thought we were invincible.</i>

4
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,611
<i>Someone once said,
if you want something very badly,</i>

5
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,572
<i>set it free.</i>

6
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,700
<i>If it comes back to you,
it's yours forever.</i>

7
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>If it doesn't,
it was never yours to begin with.</i>

8
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,502
<i>I knew one thing,
I was David's to begin with.</i>

9
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,212
<i>And he was mine.</i>

10
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:15,927
<i>You light up my life, you give…</i>

11
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,554
<i>We met in high school.</i>

12
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,349
<i>David was a senior
and I was a freshman.</i>

13
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,975
<i>On Wednesdays, after glee club,</i>

14
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,145
<i>he'd drive me and my best friend home
from school.</i>

15
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,522
<i>I used to watch him
in the rear view mirror.</i>

16
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,359
<i>I fell in love with his eyes.</i>

17
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>When I was 19, David proposed to me
on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

18
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,330
<i>Our parents were against it.</i>

19
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,417
<i>They said we were too young
and we really didn't know each other.</i>

20
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,588
<i>But David said that
a life without risk is like no life at all.</i>

21
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,007
<i>So we eloped.</i>

22
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:16,446
<i>I graduated from architecture school
and got a job at a small firm.</i>

23
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>Diana helped support us
by selling real estate.</i>

24
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>I spent all of my free time
working on a design of my own.</i>

25
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,873
<i>It summed up everything
about architecture</i>

26
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,126
<i>that really mattered to me.</i>

27
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,086
<i>It was my dream house.</i>

28
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,412
D.

29
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,959
Have I ever told you I love you?

30
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,045
No.

31
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,630
I do.

32
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,174
Still?

33
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,426
Always.

34
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,473
<i>We had our differences.</i>

35
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,058
<i>He used to take his clothes off
and leave them on the floor.</i>

36
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,810
<i>It made me crazy.</i>

37
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,127
What do you think this is, huh?
Leaving your shoes on the table?

38
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,546
-What is the problem here?
-I don't need to do your fucking laundry!

39
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,631
Honey, I'll pick it up.

40
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,591
-You don't have to get violent on me.
-What about this, huh?

41
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,635
-No, no. You put that down, honey.
-Peanut butter sandwich…

42
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,345
That is serious.
You're gonna hurt somebody with that.

43
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,763
I'm gonna hurt somebody, huh?

44
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,806
You're out of your mind.

45
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,892
Okay, now. Fine.

46
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,813
God damn it!

47
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,234
Come on, let's just relax.

48
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,277
Did I hurt you?

49
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,321
-No. I'm all right.
-I'm sorry.

50
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,989
-Really?
-Yeah.

51
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,533
You were kidding?

52
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,827
D, your pants are on fire.

53
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,122
You have no idea.

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,932
<i>We never had much money,
so for entertainment</i>

55
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,893
<i>David would show me architecture
that moved him.</i>

56
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,895
<i>But sometimes I'd have to ask,</i>

57
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,815
<i>"Why are we looking
at a stupid car wash?"</i>

58
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,235
<i>And he would just say, "No, not stupid.</i>

59
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,946
<i>"Don't just use your eyes. "</i>

60
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,699
<i>He made me look at things differently.</i>

61
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,870
David, this is a steal.
It just came in to the office

62
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,663
and nobody even knows about it yet.

63
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,831
It's beautiful.

64
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,959
You could build a house here.
You'll have made a name for yourself,

65
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,711
because of course,
the house would be brilliant.

66
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,713
Because it would be
a David Murphy house.

67
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,176
<i>I found an incredible piece of property
in Santa Monica by the ocean.</i>

68
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,011
<i>It was the perfect site for David's house.</i>

69
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,095
How are we supposed to do it?

70
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,930
We'll borrow the money
like everybody else.

71
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,808
I'm telling you, these leverage
stock broker buyout guys,

72
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,268
you should see the junk they buy.
Are you kidding?

73
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,104
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

74
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,607
<i>It was brilliant,</i>

75
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>even though I didn't
understand a word of it.</i>

76
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,820
<i>We had to tighten our belts
for the loan payments,</i>

77
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,199
<i>but it was our future.
And I got to build my house.</i>

78
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,914
<i>And then the recession hit.</i>

79
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,835
<i>The real estate market dried up
and I hadn't closed a sale in six months.</i>

80
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,339
<i>Construction fell
to its lowest point in years.</i>

81
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,634
<i>People were being laid off everywhere.
And I was one of them.</i>

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,469
I feel really bad about this.

83
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,972
I don't understand. What happened?

84
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,974
The bank has called in
the demand note.

85
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,643
Can they do that?

86
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:01,064
You don't have any income right now,
so they could attach your assets.

87
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,567
What assets?

88
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,738
Your house.

89
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,367
You got to keep up those payments.

90
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,036
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,093
David, I'm scared.

92
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,141
We don't have any money.

93
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,644
What are we gonna do?

94
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,776
I'll wait tables
or drive a cab or something.

95
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,289
Hey, I'll take care of you.

96
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,960
Make it go away.

97
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,055
<i>I was desperate.
We stood to lose everything.</i>

98
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,224
<i>The house I'd been building,
even our own home.</i>

99
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,437
<i>I swallowed my pride
and borrowed $5, 000 from my father.</i>

100
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,647
<i>It wasn't enough.</i>

101
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,692
<i>We needed $50, 000.</i>

102
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,332
-D. D, D.
-What?

103
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,000
-Get up, get dressed.
-What's the matter?

104
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,336
-I got an idea. Come on.
-What?

105
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,088
-What time is it?
-Chop chop.

106
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,824
Hi, how you doing? Okay.

107
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,451
Cigars. Cigarettes. Lighted yo-yos.

108
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,832
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, my God!

109
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,502
Oh, honey. That's the spirit!
Keep them coming.

110
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,713
$50, 000, that's what we want.
We're winners!

111
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,850
Boom, skinny, skinny!
Put some money in the kitty.

112
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,061
Eleven. Winner.

113
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,564
We got a shooter now, folks.
We got a shooter.

114
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,274
A lucky, lucky lady shooter.

115
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,609
Keep it coming. Stack it, don't rack it!

116
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,366
If I haven't gotten nine,
Denzel Washington ain't fine.

117
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,035
Hard six! Hard six!

118
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,580
-All bets set, folks.
-Who's the one?

119
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,685
And I have a necklace…

120
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,690
Why don't you put it on?

121
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,192
It suits you.

122
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,405
Well, I can't afford it.

123
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,574
That's too bad.

124
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,535
Yep.

125
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,001
I really think
you ought to have the dress.

126
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,545
Let me buy it for you.

127
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,340
-You want to buy me this dress?
-Yeah.

128
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,928
-Why?
-I've enjoyed watching you.

129
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,098
You've earned it.

130
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,102
No, I haven't.

131
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,649
The dress is for sale. I'm not.

132
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,323
Boom, skinny, skinny!

133
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,160
Pull in that. Pull in that stack.

134
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,995
We got a new shooter, now.
Coming out.

135
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,747
Coming out to seven or eleven.

136
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,874
Roll them now, girlfriend.

137
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,334
Seven!

138
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,552
Come on now! Come on.

139
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,139
-I can't lose. I'm up over $9, 000.
-Oh, my God!

140
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,932
I can't believe it!

141
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,982
-$9, 000.
-My God, it's so great!

142
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,193
This is my wife D. These are my girls.

143
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,445
They're gonna be moving in. All right.

144
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,614
Come on. Kiss them.

145
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,202
Bets, please.

146
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,913
'Cause we're winners!

147
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,791
Boom, skinny, skinny!

148
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,342
Did I ever tell you I love you?

149
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,551
-No.
-I do.

150
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,178
-Still?
-Always.

151
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,911
Five thousand.
This little pile here, you guessed it.

152
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,746
Five more, D.

153
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,582
What do you think this is? Five more.

154
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,877
Play with it,
roll around with it, enjoy yourself.

155
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,587
Oh, my!

156
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,009
And the grand total is…

157
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,099
$25, 040.

158
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,894
So, we're half-way there, like in an hour.

159
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,357
I figure about two hours tomorrow,

160
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,193
-we'll be home free.
-Come here.

161
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,044
What?

162
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,217
I love you.

163
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,681
I know that.

164
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,852
No, I mean, even without the money.

165
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,101
Let's split the three and the six for me.

166
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,357
-That's right. Why don't you split them?
-Fifteen.

167
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,487
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

168
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,120
Come on, black. Come on, black.
Here we go.

169
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,914
Yes!

170
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,383
Double zero.

171
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,219
No more bets, please.

172
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,058
Come on, black. Here we go.

173
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,103
Yes, we won!

174
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,466
$4, 100, we said
we wouldn't go below $5, 000.

175
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,718
Do you want any more coffee?

176
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,553
No, thank you.

177
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,156
Tails, we quit. Heads, we go for it.

178
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,469
Two out of three.

179
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,972
Last call for wagers.

180
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,184
No more bets.

181
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,437
Okay. I'm feeling lucky.
I say we put it on red.

182
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,148
All of it. Red.

183
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,944
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

184
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,115
We can do this, huh? D?

185
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,701
I'm gonna put it all.

186
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,539
I'm putting it on red.

187
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,458
Okay.

188
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,149
-No, it's black! It's black.
-What are you doing?

189
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,609
-It's black.
-What are you doing?

190
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,116
No, no, it's red. It's red.

191
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,410
Go with your instincts. Right?

192
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,538
-No more bets.
-Oh, come on, man. Come on, red.

193
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,710
Got to get it. Got to get it.

194
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,172
Come on, red. Come on, red.

195
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,641
Too late, young lady.

196
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,516
Place your bets. Bank side, player side.

197
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,143
All set? Cards, please.

198
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,607
Turning for the players.

199
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,276
Passes to the right, please.

200
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,200
Player draws nothing.

201
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,752
And set.

202
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,756
Player side, banker side.

203
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,842
-Any other bets?
-Who's that guy?

204
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,594
That's John Gage.

205
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:30,182
He's a damn billionaire.
That's a rich son-of-a-bitch, right there.

206
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,935
He's down over
a million dollars already.

207
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,688
You see those little gold things
he's playing with?

208
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,398
$10, 000 a piece.

209
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,485
Every time he lays one down,
ten thousand big ones.

210
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,279
Look at him, how cool he is.

211
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,572
That son-of-a-bitch
must get more pussy

212
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,073
than you can shake a stick at.

213
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,867
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you or anything.

214
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,201
-Player wins.
-What are y'all doing here?

215
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,661
-You gambling?
-No.

216
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,580
It's about time.

217
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,664
Y'all married?

218
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,207
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

219
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,417
Stick around and gamble a little.

220
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,336
Excuse me. Excuse me.

221
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,883
Would you mind lending me your wife?

222
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,551
Is that your wife?

223
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,969
Excuse me?

224
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,222
For luck.

225
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,309
You'd have to ask her.

226
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,811
May I?

227
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,356
-Go for it.
-I don't think it's a good idea.

228
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,649
I think we should just go.

229
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,234
Just for a moment?

230
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,737
-I'll go.
-Go ahead. It might be fun.

231
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,822
What do we got to lose?

232
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,157
Well?

233
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,825
Why don't you go in
and see what happens?

234
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,327
Yeah. Go ahead.

235
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,829
We'll be right here backing you up.

236
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,581
Thank you.

237
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,126
See if you can get a little
of that money from him.

238
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,754
Do you think she'll ever come back?

239
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,007
I'm just bullshitting you.

240
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,552
Have a seat.

241
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,262
I've been losing all day long.

242
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,972
Then you appeared
and I won my first hand.

243
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,849
You brought me luck.

244
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:58,312
I'd say that's a sign. Wouldn't you?

245
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,860
-Would you like a drink?
-No, thank you.

246
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,362
Candy?

247
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,784
Place your bets.

248
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,869
-Bank side, player side.
-$100, 000.

249
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,537
Any other bets?

250
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,124
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

251
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,584
All bets set.

252
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,003
$20 tie-in.

253
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,341
Not like that.

254
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,468
Sorry.

255
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,224
All bets set. Cards, please.

256
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,147
-Turning for the players.
-Now, what we want…

257
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,151
What we need is a nine.

258
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,536
We don't like that.

259
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,747
Player draws nothing.
Cards for the bank, please.

260
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,084
Bank's a winner with a natural eight.
Pay the bank.

261
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,340
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.

262
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,092
Do you like cards?

263
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,594
Not especially.

264
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,847
Wish I'd asked you sooner.

265
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,056
Dice?

266
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,809
Yeah, I guess.

267
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,564
Sam.

268
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,649
Mr. G?

269
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,153
One.

270
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,488
Excuse me, Mr. G.

271
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,041
Well, maybe I should go.

272
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,251
This shouldn't take too long.
Here we go.

273
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,253
-What?
-This.

274
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,137
Now,

275
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,183
I hope you find this interesting.

276
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,477
Pit. Tadross.

277
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,314
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it's here now.

278
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,357
Yes, sir.

279
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,489
I understand.

280
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,909
Yes, sir. Thank you.

281
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,744
Goes for $1 million.

282
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,245
It's a bet.

283
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,627
Here you are, Mr. G, $1 million.

284
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,823
Bet it all.

285
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,889
Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven.
This time it is a come out roll.

286
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,016
Hone those skills now. Get them down.

287
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,393
Pick two.

288
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,027
Now, just throw a seven.

289
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,031
If you want to throw an eleven,
that's all right, too.

290
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,789
Aren't you forgetting something?

291
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,186
Seven!

292
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,615
The winner is seven. Everyone.

293
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,077
Think I ought to quit now?

294
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,204
I think I should.

295
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,083
Credit my account.

296
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,711
Excuse me. Excuse me.

297
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,881
Sweetie, it was amazing.
Incredible. Oh, my God.

298
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,382
Unbelievable.

299
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,843
Hi. John Gage.

300
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,471
-Oh, hi. David Murphy.
-Hi, David.

301
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,308
Congratulations. This is my wife, Diana.
I guess you met.

302
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,560
-Hi, Diana? Hi.
-Diana.

303
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,480
Thank you, both.

304
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,941
Very generous of you, David.
Are you staying at the hotel?

305
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,776
Oh, no. Actually, we were just leaving.

306
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,235
-You're leaving?
-Yes, we're on our way out.

307
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,655
No, no, no, no. Don't do that.
We got to celebrate.

308
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,949
Let me arrange a room for you here.

309
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,743
-That's very nice, but…
-No, I… I insist.

310
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,746
Please. It's the least I can do. Okay?

311
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,791
Really, just sign for it.
Anything you want.

312
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,878
There's some lovely shops off the lobby.
Have you seen them?

313
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,258
Let's go.

314
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,604
How about that?

315
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,693
Wow.

316
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,614
Hey, D, what do you think? <i>Godfather?</i>

317
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,206
You won a million dollars today.

318
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,500
He won it.

319
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,669
Honey, you won it for him.

320
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,137
This feels nice.

321
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,474
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

322
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,934
-Okay.
-Okay.

323
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,612
Hello. William Shackleford.

324
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,323
Hi. David Murphy.

325
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,202
For Mrs. Murphy, from John Gage.

326
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,498
-Well, thank him for us.
-I'll do that.

327
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:37,044
Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering tonight
in his suite at 9: 00.

328
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,670
If you could find the time
in your schedule,

329
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,589
he'd be most pleased.

330
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,469
-Look what you got.
-What?

331
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,138
A gift from Gage.

332
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,099
Really?

333
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,102
Well, open it up.

334
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,240
That's $5, 000.

335
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,494
How do you know that?

336
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,122
I… I saw it in the store downstairs.

337
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,961
-Lucky for him you like black.
-Yeah.

338
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,559
No past, no future, you just check into
a hotel and start all over again.

339
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,106
I'd stick them under the sheets…

340
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,276
That's strange, am I right?

341
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,550
Who is that guy, Shackleford?

342
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:35,639
Someone who works for me.
Someone I trust.

343
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,103
He killed someone once.

344
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,612
Tell me, where do you see yourself
in, say, ten years?

345
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,826
Well, I wouldn't mind
being a billionaire like yourself.

346
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,871
No… Nice shot. I mean, beyond money.

347
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,667
What would satisfy you completely,
let you sleep well at night?

348
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,711
What, are you saying
you're not satisfied?

349
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,046
Who is?

350
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,423
I am.

351
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,178
She mean it?

352
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,931
I hope so.

353
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,892
Well, then,
you may not have won in Vegas,

354
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:21,977
but you're a lucky man.

355
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,522
'Cause I got money. I got security.
I have businesses,

356
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,024
but you have something
that I just don't have.

357
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,403
Well, I guess there's limits
to what money can buy.

358
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,446
Not many.

359
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,284
Well, some things aren't for sale.

360
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,703
Such as?

361
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,039
Well, you can't buy people.

362
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,460
That's naive, Diana.
I buy people every day.

363
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,753
Well, in business, maybe,

364
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,548
but not when real emotions
are involved.

365
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,383
So, what are you saying?
You can't buy love?

366
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,344
That's a bit of a cliche, don't you think?

367
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,513
It's absolutely true.

368
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,890
Is it? What do you think?

369
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,185
-I agree with Diana.
-You do?

370
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,815
Well, let's test the cliche.

371
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:18,116
Suppose I were to offer you $1 million

372
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,413
for one night with your wife.

373
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,129
I'd assume you're kidding.

374
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,300
Let's pretend I'm not.
What would you say?

375
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,139
He'd tell you to go to hell.

376
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,601
I didn't hear him.

377
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,188
I'd tell you to go to hell.

378
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,204
That's a reflex answer
because you view it as hypothetical.

379
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,665
But let's say that
there were real money behind it.

380
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,504
I'm not kidding. A million dollars.

381
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,675
Now, the night would come and go,
but the money could last a lifetime.

382
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:21,680
Think of it. A million dollars.

383
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,936
A lifetime of security, for one night.

384
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,316
And don't answer right away.
But consider it.

385
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,277
Seriously.

386
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,781
We're positive, okay?

387
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,079
Well, then,
you've answered my question.

388
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:50,417
And you've proved your point.
There are limits to what money can buy.

389
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:54,504
It's late, and I hate to admit it,
but I have a meeting.

390
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,965
May I have one dance?

391
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,093
Of course, with your permission.

392
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,679
You know something,
I think you better get on to that meeting.

393
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,890
You don't want to miss out
on your next billion.

394
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,436
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her, either.

395
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,356
Good night.

396
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,956
Can't sleep?

397
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,002
No.

398
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,714
Me, neither.

399
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,640
I just keep thinking about it.

400
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,770
It's so weird, isn't it?

401
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,607
Yeah.

402
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,699
David, I think you want me to do it.

403
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:56,000
What are you talking about?
Don't be ridiculous.

404
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,005
Well, maybe we should
just talk about it.

405
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,466
Well, I don't want you to do it.

406
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,100
-But you'd let me do it.
-No.

407
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,275
Why, do you want to do it?

408
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,820
No.

409
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,283
But I would.

410
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,452
I'd do it for you.

411
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,081
For me?

412
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,303
I can't believe
we're even talking about this.

413
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,640
Think about what this money
could do for us.

414
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,101
What it could do for our future.

415
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,692
You could finish your house.
You could pay your dad back.

416
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,528
Get rid of our debt.

417
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,991
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

418
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:15,288
It's just my body.
It's not my mind. It's not my heart.

419
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,753
You think we could
do something like that?

420
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,305
Look, we both slept with other people
before we were married, right?

421
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,514
Yeah.

422
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,769
So we'd just have to look at it like that.

423
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,233
I slept with Bubba Aruzio,
for God's sake.

424
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,777
If I can sleep with Bubba,
I can sleep with anybody.

425
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,654
You slept with Bubba?

426
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,281
-Come on, you knew.
-No, I didn't know that.

427
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,659
When did you sleep with Bubba?

428
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,121
When you were off
sleeping with that slut Olivia Daigle.

429
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:01,167
-Olivia Deagle. She wasn't a slut.
-Oh, excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

430
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,420
I'm telling you. She wasn't a slut.

431
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,755
-Yes, she was.
-No, she wasn't.

432
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,091
-Yes, she was.
-No, she wasn't.

433
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,134
Unfortunately.

434
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,516
Thank God we can laugh about it.

435
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,477
Yeah.

436
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,105
That's easy to say now. But after…

437
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,446
We'd just have to
forget it ever happened.

438
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,285
And never discuss it. Not even once.

439
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,959
I mean, because nothing
would have happened.

440
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,380
Nothing that matters, anyway.

441
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,392
We have a brilliant script,
really, very special.

442
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,436
-Major.
-It's a vehicle,

443
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,397
-a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.
-Billy Ray Cyrus.

444
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,191
-It's kind of <i>A Star is Born.
</i>-So…

445
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,360
Your first screenplay
sold for half a million.

446
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,903
-Should have been two.
-Yeah, except our lawyer,

447
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,363
son-of-a-bitch, caved in on us.

448
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,573
-That won't happen again.
-No.

449
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,075
See, we're gonna get a lawyer
that's tough, a lawyer that's savvy…

450
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,370
Someone who would
step on his grandmother for us.

451
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,582
<i>Mr. Green, a David Murphy
would like to speak to you.</i>

452
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,250
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

453
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,918
Put him on the speaker.

454
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,880
This is an old college buddy of mine.
It'll only take a second.

455
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,381
<i>-Jeremy?
</i>-Davey.

456
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,175
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
What's up?

457
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,677
<i>Well, listen,
we need you to close a deal.</i>

458
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,638
-What kind of deal?
<i>-A big deal, a very big deal.</i>

459
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,307
Big deal. Go on.

460
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,018
<i>We're in Vegas, at the Hilton.</i>

461
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,687
<i>We met John Gage.
You know who he is?</i>

462
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,731
Sure, I know who he is.
He's a billionaire,

463
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,858
and a major poon hound.

464
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,527
<i>He is?</i>

465
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,945
Go on.

466
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,323
<i>He offered us a million dollars.</i>

467
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,910
A million dollars?
For what? Your kidneys?

468
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,747
<i>For one night with Diana.</i>

469
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,754
What do you mean? One night, like…

470
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,922
<i>Yes.</i>

471
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,677
Could you excuse me for a second?

472
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,435
Let me get this straight.

473
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,563
He offered you a million dollars
for a night with your wife?

474
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,565
As in your wife, Diana?

475
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,776
And you agreed to it?

476
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,279
I don't know what to say, man.
How could you do something like that?

477
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,281
How could you negotiate without me?

478
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,118
Never negotiate
without your lawyer! Never!

479
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:44,330
For a woman like Diana,
I could have got you at least two million!

480
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,959
Obviously! You don't want
to get screwed, and then screwed.

481
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,795
Hey, stay. Please.
This is damage control.

482
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,004
Two seconds. Eat cookies.

483
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,548
-There's cookies coming.
-No. You don't understand.

484
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,966
-We've heard enough.
-You're hired.

485
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,759
You are. You're our man.
We love your style.

486
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:57,844
-Great.
-Thank you.

487
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,470
Gladys, check
the gentlemen's schedules.

488
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,305
And call me next week.
Wednesday? Wednesday good?

489
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,932
-Great. Okay.
-See you then.

490
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,183
-Thanks for coming.
-No, thank you.

491
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,352
-No, thank you.
-Thank you.

492
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,439
Okay, David,
before we go any further, let's…

493
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,943
Let's get the moral issue out of the way.

494
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,153
<i>-Leave that to us.
</i>-No, I was referring to my fee.

495
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,989
I get five percent.

496
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,827
Do you want to elaborate
on the verification clause?

497
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,537
Verification…

498
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,499
That means you pay even if
the relationship isn't consummated.

499
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,252
You mean if I'm impotent.

500
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,923
It's important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies.

501
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,677
I can live with that.
The John Garfield clause?

502
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,138
That's if you die in the act.

503
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,729
I have no problem with that, either.
Can I have your pen?

504
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,822
-You're pretty good, you know?
-Thank you.

505
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,366
You should come work for me.

506
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,296
We have a deal.

507
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:24,305
A million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account in the morning.

508
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,103
So…

509
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,190
So…

510
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,609
So…

511
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,113
You can go.

512
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,408
Gentlemen, I think it's time
for men of good will

513
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,703
to take leave of one another.

514
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,692
It's all right. I don't bite.

515
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,238
So…

516
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,409
What, should I go undress?

517
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,708
You know, cheer up.
You got to find a more creative way

518
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,792
to think about this, okay?

519
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,627
Just look at it like an episode
of <i>The Dating Game</i>

520
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,630
that went a little bit, you know,
awry or something like that.

521
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,299
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

522
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:46,721
<i>we wish to welcome you
to our jamboree.</i>

523
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,808
… I couldn't believe it.
I know we could've gotten two million.

524
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:52,893
Here's your Buddha.

525
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,896
Davey, no point
getting out the crying towel.

526
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,358
You got a million bucks, buddy.
A million bucks.

527
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,823
She's an amazing woman. She really is.

528
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,867
Couldn't have gotten $500
for my girlfriend.

529
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,910
Not that I'd do that.

530
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,621
But it's okay that you did.

531
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,374
This is a different situation
and she agreed to it.

532
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,043
You got to remember that.

533
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,545
And it's not like it's hard duty
or anything like that.

534
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,589
Hell, he's a great looking guy.

535
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,675
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

536
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,261
Maybe not.

537
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,306
Hey, buddy!

538
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,861
Come on!

539
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,123
Come on. Come on.

540
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,419
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

541
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,143
D? It's me.

542
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,482
D! D!

543
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,320
Where is she? Where's my wife?

544
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,032
Where is she?

545
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,787
Diana!

546
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,206
Please!

547
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,916
Where did she go?
What happened to her?

548
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,751
-Where'd they go?
-Up. Up.

549
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,837
-Up! Up where?
-Up.

550
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,630
Helicopter.

551
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,192
D!

552
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,530
D!

553
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,410
D! D!

554
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,624
D!

555
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,635
They sent for me.
They said you were ready.

556
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,025
Come here.

557
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,633
You missed a button.

558
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,893
Thank you.

559
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,314
I want to show you something.

560
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,081
What happened?

561
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,501
The lights went out.

562
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,214
I see that. Why?

563
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,552
Look.

564
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,727
Can you turn those off, too?

565
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,233
I'm working on it.

566
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,865
Who made the decision?

567
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,038
-We both did.
-No.

568
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,584
Do it for your own reasons,
or don't do it.

569
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,629
You don't know him.

570
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,756
I know he didn't stop you.

571
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,592
If you were mine,

572
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,265
I wouldn't share you with anyone.

573
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,648
You have no right to judge David.

574
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,320
You're the one who has to buy women.

575
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,990
You think I have to buy women?

576
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,371
Why me, then?

577
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,833
I bought you because you said
you couldn't be bought.

578
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,211
I can't be bought.

579
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,631
We're just gonna fuck,
as I understand it.

580
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,010
You might enjoy it.

581
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,096
Don't bet on it.

582
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,685
I think I will.

583
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,442
Heads, we do.

584
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,444
Tails, we call the whole thing off,

585
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,655
turn the boat around, go home.
No hard feelings.

586
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,949
What do you say?

587
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,661
It's your party.

588
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,540
It's my lucky dollar.

589
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,501
So I can't lose.

590
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,983
Trust me.

591
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:29,488
Nothing's gonna happen
you don't choose.

592
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,665
-I love you.
-I love you.

593
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,017
<i>I told myself it was over.</i>

594
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,937
<i>Like a dream
that vanishes in the morning light.</i>

595
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,649
<i>And in time, enough time,
I would forget.</i>

596
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:27,040
Yeah.

597
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,418
All right.

598
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,464
Yeah.

599
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,925
Yeah, a little fixer-upper
south of Wilshire.

600
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,677
It's nothing. Yeah.

601
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,556
Look, I've got people here.

602
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,599
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

603
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,477
Sorry, I'm here for you now.

604
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,731
-All right. Two acres on Alta Loma…
-Alta Vista.

605
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,776
Vista. It's right here. Murphy property.

606
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,154
Yeah. We've been a little late
on the payments.

607
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,030
We want to settle up.

608
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:02,951
-I don't think that's possible.
-What do you mean?

609
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,328
Well, the mortgage
is two months in default.

610
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,583
And it appears that the property
is in contract to another party.

611
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,421
-To another party? Who?
-That's privileged information.

612
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,340
How can that be?
We called specifically for an extension.

613
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,135
The extension expired two days ago.

614
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,430
You don't make a payment,
the bank can repossess.

615
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,224
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

616
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,311
Under the terms of this agreement,
they don't have to give us a warning.

617
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,480
But in fact, an attempt was made
to call you on the third,

618
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,858
and a registered letter
return receipt requested,

619
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,359
was attempted on the fourth.

620
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,445
Apparently, there was no one home.

621
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,238
-We were out of town.
-We were out of town.

622
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:44,534
Well, I am sorry,
but you snooze, you lose.

623
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,455
You snooze, you lose.

624
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,459
-"You snooze, you lose"?
-It's an expression.

625
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,669
You snooze, you lose.
Oh, that's beautiful.

626
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,380
You snooze, you lose. That's bullshit!

627
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,676
-This is bullshit, man.
-David…

628
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,345
Hey, don't deal with these people.

629
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,306
They sold us out,
they'll sell you out, too.

630
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,021
Hey, want to help me in the garden?

631
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,857
Okay.

632
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,370
Our tomatoes are looking good,
don't you think?

633
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,165
David?

634
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,045
What's Gryphon?

635
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,048
<i>Gryphon.</i>

636
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,261
Where did you hear that name?

637
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,556
You have a box of matches.

638
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,477
We said we wouldn't talk about it.

639
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,355
Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

640
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,943
-Don't you?
-No.

641
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:49,200
D, I thought I could forget about this,
but I can't.

642
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:56,166
So I think maybe if we just talk about it,
we can put it behind us.

643
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,050
<i>Gryphon </i>is a boat.

644
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,846
He took you to a boat? In Nevada?

645
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:13,308
-We flew to Santa Barbara.
-What kind of boat?

646
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,602
-A big boat.
-And then what?

647
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,896
And then nothing.

648
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:24,027
Where did you get the matches?
Have you been going through my bag?

649
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,153
No.

650
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,742
Why? What's in your bag?

651
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:34,621
I'm not gonna talk about this.
I'm not gonna do it.

652
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:12,886
What?

653
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,514
Who you talking to?

654
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,892
My mother.

655
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,187
And what did Mom have to say?

656
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,399
Nothing. She wasn't there.

657
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,401
I thought you said
you were just talking to her.

658
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,904
How could you be talking to her
if she wasn't there?

659
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:34,616
Well, I was trying to talk to her,
but I didn't reach her.

660
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,660
-She wasn't in after 10: 00?
-No. She's not.

661
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,830
If you don't believe me,
would you like to talk to her yourself?

662
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,836
What is the matter with you?

663
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,595
-What is that?
-You know what it is.

664
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,602
-Where did you get this?
-In your wallet.

665
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,354
Well, I've never seen it before.

666
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,689
Well, it was right there
in the old secret compartment.

667
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,774
David, I don't even use that.

668
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,442
-Have you been seeing him?
-No, I haven't.

669
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,110
You can't stop thinking about him,
can you?

670
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,030
-You won't let me.
-Can you, D?

671
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,782
What are you doing
going through my wallet, <i>anyway?</i>

672
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,991
-I don't trust you.
-Well, you know what?

673
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,201
I don't trust you, either.

674
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,203
Well, then we're even.

675
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,589
<i>I had to do something.</i>

676
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,717
<i>I wanted to make something good
out of all we'd done wrong.</i>

677
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,428
<i>I decided to try and buy our land back.</i>

678
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,682
Okay, Alta Vista…

679
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:45,353
I just need to find out the guy's name.
I want to make him an offer.

680
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,897
I'll get killed for this, Diana.

681
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,066
I don't want you to get in trouble.
I really appreciate it.

682
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,361
-543, Alta Vista…
-Wait, there it is. There it is right there.

683
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,904
-Okay. Okay.
-Back up.

684
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:58,157
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

685
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,745
Oh, my God, look at this.
This guy's never gonna sell, Diana.

686
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,748
He's one of the…
I just saw this guy on TV.

687
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,684
I'm not going back in there.

688
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,208
You bastard! You stole our property!

689
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,129
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce
a friend of mine…

690
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,964
I'm not your friend.

691
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,050
Diana advised me on a piece of property
in Santa Monica.

692
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,927
That's bullshit. You're a liar.
You took it, and I want it back.

693
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,055
I tell you what, can we have a…
Excuse me. That's okay.

694
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,640
No, everything's fine.
Everything's under control.

695
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,266
Very well, sir.

696
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,353
Excuse me.

697
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,737
I'm taking it off.

698
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,492
Wait a minute.

699
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:23,951
Why? What, did you
just want to hurt me?

700
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,578
Nonsense. I think you're wonderful.

701
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,288
That was our house.
How could you do that?

702
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:30,375
-I got there first.
-I want you to sell it back to me.

703
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:33,252
-You can't afford it.
-Well, how's a million dollars?

704
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,171
The price is two.

705
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,298
Oh, and if I had two,
the price would be four, right?

706
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:39,592
Listen, I saw an opportunity and I took it.

707
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,052
You had the money,
you had the right instincts,

708
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,554
but you were too late. That's all.

709
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,349
-I want you to work for me.
-You go to hell.

710
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,018
-Listen, I mean it.
-Never.

711
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,311
Why not?

712
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,523
-Because I hate you.
-No, you don't.

713
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,734
You wish you hated me.

714
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:18,840
Hi, D.

715
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,887
You look awful.

716
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,642
-Where you been?
-I'll tell you about it.

717
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,603
I'm just gonna have some wine first.

718
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,108
Do you want some?

719
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,341
So, where you been?

720
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:12,185
Last night I stayed up for hours
trying to figure a way out of this mess.

721
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,189
And today?

722
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,861
And today I saw Gage.

723
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,623
Thank you for your trust, David.
And for listening.

724
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,417
-Did you fuck him?
-No.

725
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,793
But you wanted to, right?

726
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,546
David, I met him in broad daylight,
surrounded by a bunch of rich assholes.

727
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,089
I don't believe you.

728
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:44,717
David, he bought our property, okay?

729
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,928
That's why I went to see him.

730
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:50,014
I just wanted to find some way
to get it back.

731
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:54,352
You have no reason to be jealous.
I hate him.

732
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,646
D, you gotta tell me
what happened on that boat.

733
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,482
-David, don't do this. Don't do this!
-Tell me what happened on that boat.

734
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,776
-Why?
-Because I want to know.

735
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,696
All right, I'll tell you. You know what?
The man was a fucking stallion, David.

736
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,698
Is that what you want me to say?
We did it all night long.

737
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,825
-Does that do it for you?
-Is that the truth?

738
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,744
The truth?
You don't want the fucking truth.

739
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,704
You want me to lie.
You want me to say he's awful.

740
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,206
So, you know what?
I'm gonna tell you he's awful

741
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,624
and you won't believe me.
How can I win?

742
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,751
Just tell me the truth, D.

743
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,629
It was sex, David. Just sex.

744
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,422
Not love. Just sex.

745
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,175
-And was it good sex?
-Don't do this, David.

746
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,261
Can you just tell me that, D?
Was it good?

747
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,845
What are you hesitating for?
Just tell me.

748
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,765
Was it good? Was it good?
Was it good?

749
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,767
Yes.

750
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,113
David.

751
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:54,328
D, don't you tell me it was just sex

752
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:56,205
because you were attracted to him
all along.

753
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,291
You know that's bullshit.

754
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,792
David, I did it for you.

755
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,586
Don't you tell me you did it for me.

756
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,629
-You did it for yourself.
-That's not… That's a lie.

757
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,423
-You were dying to do it.
-That's a lie.

758
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:08,342
I would never do this for myself.
It was all for you.

759
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,721
Don't lie to me!
You were attracted to him!

760
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,660
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

761
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:20,998
I guess you make a deal with the devil,
and eventually you pay the price, right?

762
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,042
Thanks, Jeremy.

763
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,211
Coming from the man
who closed the deal with the devil,

764
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,671
that's very comforting.

765
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:33,386
Green. Oh, hi, Di.

766
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:35,805
I'm not here.

767
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,350
Yeah, he's right here.
You want to speak to him?

768
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,687
-No, I don't want to talk to him.
<i>-Look, sweetie,</i>

769
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:48,567
he loves you, you love him.
I mean, you got to try and work this out.

770
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,236
It's all pretty simple, right?

771
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,196
<i>This is a deal even I can't screw up.</i>

772
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:57,576
Tell him he can keep the money.
I don't want any of it.

773
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:10,381
Davey, she said
she doesn't want the money.

774
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:14,218
Well, I don't want the money, either.

775
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,772
I'll take it. I mean, nobody else wants it.

776
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,630
-Hey.
-Hi, Diana.

777
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,899
<i>The next few weeks without David
felt like months.</i>

778
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,527
<i>I got very good at staring at walls.</i>

779
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:19,492
Diana. Diana. The recession has ended.

780
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:23,746
There's a fellow out there,
he wants to see $10 million homes.

781
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,498
There is a God.

782
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,712
Find someone else.

783
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:35,633
Find someone else? Are you nuts?

784
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:37,676
Do you know what the commission is
on $10 million?

785
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,054
-I can't do it.
-You have to do it.

786
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,223
You're the best one I have.

787
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:46,018
You're the only one I have.
The others are all on caravan.

788
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,442
I'm sorry, Mr. Langford, I can't.

789
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:59,031
Diana, I would never dream of forcing
you to do anything against your will.

790
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,660
Except this one time.

791
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,331
Now, move your ass or you're fired.

792
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,966
If you think this is going to work,
you underestimate me.

793
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,368
You are truly beautiful.

794
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,747
What do you think you're doing?

795
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,501
Looking for a house.

796
01:17:57,131 --> 01:18:00,342
Well, there's Bel Air, Holmby Hills,
Benedict Canyon, Pacific Palisades.

797
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,178
-Where would you like to go first?
-Paris.

798
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,600
1120 Bel-Air Road, please.

799
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:19,278
The ceilings are French Gothic.

800
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,697
Renaissance paintings as you can see.

801
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,866
Parquet floors throughout.

802
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,201
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

803
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,245
This is the master bath.

804
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,628
Why didn't you return any of my calls?

805
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,965
-Do you like it?
-No.

806
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,730
-$30 million minimum.
-You think?

807
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:57,066
-I know.
-Well, let's look at it.

808
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:00,110
-It's not for sale.
-Everything's for sale.

809
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,185
This is your house, isn't it?

810
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,606
Do you like it?

811
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,364
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

812
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:51,161
What do you think it needs?
Tell me. Honestly.

813
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,583
I think it needs a life.

814
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:03,298
I think it needs furniture, and maybe
a couple of dogs and flowers.

815
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,967
It needs you.

816
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:12,016
Just forget it. It just won't work.

817
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,559
Why not?

818
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:18,856
Because from where we started,
we've got nowhere to go.

819
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,733
You don't know that.

820
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,778
I never started this way either.

821
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,241
I need you.

822
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,705
No.

823
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,374
You collect things.

824
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,087
Don't you?

825
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,424
Sometimes.

826
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:52,890
Yeah.

827
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:02,668
Even if you were extremely rich,
and extremely smart,

828
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,129
-can you be President?
-No.

829
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,214
-You couldn't be President?
-No.

830
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:08,507
Why not?

831
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:13,095
<i>I took a second job teaching citizenship
just to keep myself busy.</i>

832
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:20,227
-Ju, where were you born?
-I was born in Seoul, Korea.

833
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,062
Okay, where was she born?

834
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:25,941
-She was born in Seoul, Korea.
-She was born in Seoul, Korea.

835
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,819
Now, Ju, do you have
any children born here?

836
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:36,535
Where were you born, Miguel?

837
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:39,788
Sorry.

838
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,875
Welcome back. Where were you born?

839
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,210
-Cuba.
-Cuba.

840
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:48,255
So, how do we say Cuba in America?

841
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:52,342
Cue-ba. Hi.

842
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:57,431
-What are you doing here?
-Isn't this a citizenship class?

843
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,266
-Yes.
-Can I sit in?

844
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,269
It's full.

845
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,397
Okay.

846
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:12,529
Cuba.

847
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:14,239
Cuba. Thank you.

848
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,008
Okay. I have a question for you.

849
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:37,763
Excuse me. Is there something
you'd like to share with us?

850
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,308
I was just saying
that you're an amazing woman.

851
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:48,857
And… And beautiful.

852
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,526
And talented.

853
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,656
And I am crazy about her.

854
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:07,584
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

855
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,503
I'm trying like hell.

856
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:12,839
-I think maybe you should go.
-You want me to go?

857
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:14,132
-No.
-No.

858
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:19,846
Nice people.

859
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:24,601
-They want the dream.
-Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

860
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,024
You have chalk on your face.

861
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:37,155
I have something I want to show you.

862
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,131
I didn't know whether you liked big ones
or little ones.

863
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,678
You're so beautiful. Come here.

864
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,851
I didn't have much time
to do anything else.

865
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,023
But it's a start.

866
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:25,871
Dance?

867
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:30,375
I should go.

868
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,799
I remember once when I was young

869
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,844
and I was coming back from someplace,
a movie or something,

870
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:42,721
I was on the subway.

871
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:49,353
There was a girl sitting across from me,
and she was wearing this dress

872
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:53,774
that was buttoned clear up right to here.

873
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,073
She was the most beautiful thing
I had ever seen.

874
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,994
And I was shy then.

875
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:10,332
So when she would look at me,
I would look away.

876
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:16,088
Then, afterwards,
when I would look back,

877
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,923
she would look away.

878
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:24,930
Then I got to where I was gonna get off
and I got off, the doors closed,

879
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:30,352
and as the train was pulling away,

880
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:35,440
she looked right at me
and gave me the most incredible smile.

881
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,904
It was awful.

882
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,532
I wanted to tear the doors open.

883
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:48,203
I went back every night, same time,
for two weeks.

884
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,667
But she never showed up.

885
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,255
That was 30 years ago

886
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:04,553
and I don't think that there's a day
that goes by that I don't think about her.

887
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,807
I don't want that to happen again.

888
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,441
Just one dance?

889
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,407
I want a word with you, Gage.

890
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,453
See, what you don't know is,
we got a secret, me and Diana.

891
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:00,205
We're invincible.

892
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:03,083
Diana, I need to talk to you.

893
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,293
Maybe tomorrow
would be a better time to talk.

894
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,671
Well, maybe tomorrow
would be a better time, you think…

895
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,839
Hey, Johnny-baby,
I got a suggestion for you.

896
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,174
You know that emblem you got,

897
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:14,886
the Gryphon, the eagle,

898
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:16,221
yeah, I don't think it's a good idea.

899
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,639
I got a better idea.

900
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,307
Shall I…

901
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,017
How about the cuckoo?

902
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:24,396
You know, because, it's…
I'm talking to you for a second…

903
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,816
The cuckoo is an interesting bird
because it doesn't have its own nest,

904
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,778
so it moves into the nest
of other birds and it destroys their eggs.

905
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,613
David, stop. Just…

906
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:38,618
You don't love me anymore?

907
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,168
Have I ever…
Have I ever told you I love you?

908
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:53,133
Have a nice dinner.

909
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:56,678
Help him.

910
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,473
Go inside.

911
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,713
You've done a lot since USC.

912
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:43,219
First in your class, the AIA award,
Prix de Rome.

913
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:45,763
Yeah.

914
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,309
Why would you want this job?

915
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:51,895
Well, I want to work.

916
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,443
Over-qualified.

917
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,778
Fine. Exploit me.

918
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:40,401
Great architecture is only gonna
come from your passion.

919
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,987
And even that won't assure you a job.

920
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:47,742
Louis Kahn, died in a men's room
in Penn Station.

921
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,869
For days, no one claimed the body.

922
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:51,788
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

923
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,998
The money men did not weep.

924
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,210
Because the great ones
are impossible to deal with.

925
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,628
They're a pain in the ass,

926
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:02,090
because they know
that if they do their jobs properly,

927
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:04,759
if they just this once get it right,

928
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:09,180
they can actually lift the human spirit,
take it to a higher place.

929
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:17,021
-What is this?
-A brick.

930
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:22,110
-Good. What else?
-A weapon.

931
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:30,201
Louis Kahn said even a brick
wants to be something.

932
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:41,129
A brick wants to be something.

933
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,383
It aspires.

934
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:57,186
Even a common, ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is.

935
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,778
It wants to be something better
than it is.

936
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,706
And that is what we must be.

937
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,253
See you on Friday.

938
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:37,518
A brick wants to be something, huh?
I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

939
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,271
-What are you doing here?
-I missed you.

940
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:43,066
-I missed you, too.
-Thanks.

941
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:52,283
-How you doing?
-I'm good. Getting it together.

942
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,708
She wants a divorce.

943
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:04,879
She wants her freedom,

944
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:10,927
and if you don't contest it,
you get everything.

945
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:14,597
The land, the money, everything.

946
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,517
Where is she?

947
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,438
Hi, everybody.

948
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:29,779
<i>Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly.
Goodbye, everybody.</i>

949
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:31,948
<i>You may wonder
what you're doing here,</i>

950
01:38:32,031 --> 01:38:36,077
<i>sitting in the blazing sun
as the smell of the zoo</i>

951
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,745
<i>wafts past your nostrils.</i>

952
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:40,998
<i>The reason you're here
is because you are loaded.</i>

953
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:44,252
<i>May I say how brilliant it is
to see so many people</i>

954
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:47,588
<i>with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species.</i>

955
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:51,259
<i>Every year we have this unique way
of making money for the cause.</i>

956
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,510
<i>We auction animals.</i>

957
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,762
<i>We bid as high as we possibly can,</i>

958
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:57,265
<i>and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts.</i>

959
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:59,225
<i>Let's start the show with a bang.</i>

960
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:02,103
<i>We've got a superstar
as our first animal.</i>

961
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:05,356
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.</i>

962
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:09,193
<i>The animal itself is far too big
and angry to bring along.</i>

963
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:10,820
<i>Look at this guy.</i>

964
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:16,159
<i>Thousands and thousands of pounds
of aggressive, hostile cellulite.</i>

965
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:19,287
<i>Weighs slightly less
than the average school bus.</i>

966
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,165
<i>And look at that magnificent beastie.</i>

967
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:26,586
<i>To put him in a better light,
to relieve you of some serious money…</i>

968
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:29,130
Thank you very much.

969
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:32,049
<i>… we have a kissy-kissy picture.</i>

970
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:34,760
<i>Isn't that nice?</i>

971
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:39,473
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I couldn't even dream</i>

972
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:43,019
<i>of starting the bid below $10, 000.</i>

973
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:45,480
<i>-Now, I know that's a lot of money…
</i>-Thirty.

974
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:49,901
<i>$30, 000, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

975
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:54,947
<i>Call me a sentimental old fool,
do I hear 35?</i>

976
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:58,409
-Thirty five.
<i>-$35, 000.</i>

977
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:00,995
-Forty.
<i>-$40, 000. Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

978
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:03,497
-45, 000.
<i>-45, 000.</i>

979
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:07,043
-Fifty.
<i>-$50, 000.</i>

980
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:10,004
<i>I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.</i>

981
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:15,009
<i>$50, 000 once, $50, 000 twice,
ladies and gentlemen…</i>

982
01:40:15,468 --> 01:40:16,886
$1 million.

983
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:27,313
<i>-I'm sorry?
</i>-$1 million.

984
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,194
<i>Did you say $1 million, sir?</i>

985
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,071
Yeah.

986
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:38,282
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, $1 million.</i>

987
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:43,788
<i>Would anybody care to top that,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

988
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:45,331
<i>I didn't think so.</i>

989
01:40:45,414 --> 01:40:48,709
<i>In that case, sir, I believe
you're the proud owner of a hippo.</i>

990
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:50,461
<i>Congratulations.</i>

991
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:05,893
Hello, Diana.

992
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:09,063
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the next animal
to take the stand is an ostrich.</i>

993
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:11,732
I really wanted you to have that money.

994
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:14,652
And I really wanted you
to have that hippo.

995
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,405
<i>But we love them in Scotland…</i>

996
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:20,574
Maybe you two
would like a moment alone.

997
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:28,749
<i>So, can we hear a bid
of, maybe, a million?</i>

998
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,839
-45, 000.
<i>-$45, 000.</i>

999
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,048
So…

1000
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:40,761
-How are you?
-I hear you…

1001
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,096
-Sorry, go ahead,
-… are teaching. Go ahead.

1002
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:43,889
-I'm sorry.
-Go ahead.

1003
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,058
Yeah. I'm teaching.

1004
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:50,605
You know, it doesn't pay much,

1005
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,691
but at least I get to talk
about architecture.

1006
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,610
You know how I love to talk
about architecture.

1007
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,362
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1008
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:01,657
<i>Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.
It's just a little shower.</i>

1009
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:05,995
<i>Please, ladies…
A check book makes an ideal umbrella.</i>

1010
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:09,290
<i>Do we have a dolphin?
We have dolphins.</i>

1011
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:11,584
<i>How about tropical fish?</i>

1012
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:14,795
<i>I know, you're running home
for more cash. I get it.</i>

1013
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:18,132
<i>Come on, ladies and gentlemen,
you can find the money.</i>

1014
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:20,343
<i>Oh, to hell. I'm gone.</i>

1015
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:32,646
Listen, I have to talk to you
about what happened, D.

1016
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,399
-Don't. Don't.
-No, no, no. I have to.

1017
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:37,151
Just hear me out.

1018
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:43,157
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

1019
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:46,869
was thinking that I could forget
what we did.

1020
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:51,749
I thought we were invincible.

1021
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:57,129
But now I know that the things
that people in love do to each other,

1022
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:58,714
they remember.

1023
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:03,052
And if they stay together,
it's not because they forget,

1024
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:05,179
it's because they forgive.

1025
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:13,521
I was just…

1026
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:19,860
I was just so afraid that you wanted him.

1027
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:25,157
No, actually I was afraid
that you were right to want him.

1028
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:32,289
I thought he was the better man.

1029
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:40,131
I know now he's not.

1030
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:44,009
He's just got more money.

1031
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:18,270
I think we should talk.

1032
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:20,648
I am very happy.

1033
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:26,028
Shackleford,
have you ever seen me like this?

1034
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:29,573
I can't say that I have.

1035
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:33,744
-Diana is the reason.
-Enough for any man.

1036
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:37,206
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

1037
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:43,587
-You are the best of them.
-The best of them?

1038
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:48,217
-You said I'm the best of them?
-You are.

1039
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:53,931
I don't understand.

1040
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:58,477
Shackleford, could you explain it to her?

1041
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:02,648
What? I could do that, sir.

1042
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:08,195
But somehow I feel Miss Murphy
would rather hear it directly from you.

1043
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:09,905
Okay. All right.

1044
01:46:11,115 --> 01:46:14,785
She's the best
of the million dollar club. Obviously.

1045
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:20,874
-Million dollar club?
-Now you got it.

1046
01:46:23,752 --> 01:46:25,588
You told me you had
never done that before.

1047
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:28,424
How many members
would you say there are?

1048
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:30,467
-Members?
-Yeah.

1049
01:46:32,428 --> 01:46:34,555
-Worldwide?
-Yeah.

1050
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:38,976
I think a couple of dozen.

1051
01:46:39,977 --> 01:46:42,980
Remember the one
that wouldn't stop hiccupping?

1052
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:44,064
What?

1053
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,733
The waitress from Oklahoma.

1054
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:49,069
Every time you came near her,
she would convulse with the hiccups.

1055
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,365
Yeah, I had forgotten.

1056
01:46:54,116 --> 01:46:55,659
Quite a night.

1057
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:01,790
See, the best thing of it is that
you know if you're sexually compatible

1058
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,919
right from the start.

1059
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:18,515
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

1060
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,755
Thank you, John.

1061
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,137
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1062
01:48:05,145 --> 01:48:06,313
Here.

1063
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:12,152
For luck.

1064
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:16,907
Yeah.

1065
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:22,913
-Take care of him.
-Sure.

1066
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:33,882
What was all that about?

1067
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:37,928
I wanted to end it.

1068
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:46,103
She never would have looked at me
the way she did at him.

1069
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:41,492
<i>Seven years ago, David proposed
to me on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

1070
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:46,330
<i>I wanted to go there to remember,
and start over.</i>

1071
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:55,941
Have I ever told you I love you?

1072
01:51:06,285 --> 01:51:07,327
No.

1073
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,208
I do.

1074
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:20,674
Still?

1075
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:26,346
Always.
