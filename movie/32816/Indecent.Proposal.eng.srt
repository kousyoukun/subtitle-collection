 

1
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,629
<i>Losing Diana was like</i> <i>losing a part of me.</i>

2
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,530
<i>I thought nothing could change</i> <i>the way we felt about each other.</i>

3
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,895
<i>I thought we were invincible.</i>

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,807
<i>Someone once said, "If you</i> <i>want something very badly...</i>

5
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,811
<i>set it free.</i>

6
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,042
<i>If it comes back to you,</i> <i>it's yours forever.</i>

7
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,311
<i>If it doesn't,</i> <i>it was never yours to begin with. "</i>

8
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,791
<i>I knew one thing...</i> <i>I was David's to begin with...</i>

9
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,794
<i>and he was mine.</i>

10
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,929
<i>You light up my life</i>

11
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,832
<i>We met in high school.</i>

12
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,497
<i>David was a senior,</i> <i>and I was a freshman.</i>

13
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,199
<i>On Wednesdays</i> <i>after Glee Club...</i>

14
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,674
<i>he'd drive me and my best friend</i> <i>home from school.</i>

15
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,836
<i>I used to watch him</i> <i>in the rearview mirror.</i>

16
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,674
<i>I fell in love with his eyes.</i>

17
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,086
<i>When I was 19, David proposed to me</i> <i>on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

18
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,561
<i>Our parents were against it.</i>

19
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,598
<i>They said we were too young,</i> <i>we really didn't know each other.</i>

20
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,700
<i>But David said that a life</i> <i>without risk is like no life at all.</i>

21
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,005
<i>So we eloped.</i>

22
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,425
<i>I graduated</i> <i>from architecture school...</i>

23
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,189
<i>and got a job</i> <i>at a small firm.</i>

24
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,561
<i>Diana helped support us</i> <i>by selling real estate.</i>

25
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:24,267
<i>I spent all of my free time</i> <i>working on a design of my own.</i>

26
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,795
<i>It summed up everything about</i> <i>architecture that mattered to me.</i>

27
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,808
<i>It was my dream house.</i>

28
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,942
D?

29
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,374
Have I ever told you I love you?

30
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,710
No.

31
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,083
I do.

32
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,246
Still?

33
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,756
Always.

34
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,924
<i>We had our differences.</i>

35
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,192
<i>He used to take his clothes off</i> <i>and leave them on the floor.</i>

36
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,894
<i>It made me crazy.</i>

37
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,580
What do you think this is?

38
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,387
Leaving your shoes on the table?

39
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,757
- What is the problem? - I don't need to do your laundry!

40
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,762
Honey, I'll pick it up. You don't have to get violent.

41
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,764
What about this? Peanut butter sandwich?

42
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,562
Put that down! That is serious. You're gonna hurt somebody.

43
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,263
- Hurt somebody, huh? - You're out of your mind.

44
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,131
Okay, now, fine.

45
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,779
Goddamn it!

46
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,076
Come on. Let's just relax.

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,119
Did I hurt you? I'm sorry.

48
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,154
- Really? - Yeah.

49
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,483
You were kidding?

50
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,394
D, your pants are on fire.

51
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,702
You have no idea.

52
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,187
<i>We never had much money,</i> <i>so for entertainment...</i>

53
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,883
<i>David would show me architecture</i> <i>that moved him.</i>

54
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,085
<i>But sometimes I'd have to ask...</i>

55
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,253
<i>"Why are we looking at</i> <i>a stupid car wash?"</i>

56
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,394
<i>And he'd just say,</i> <i>"No, not stupid.</i>

57
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:44,094
<i>Don't just use your eyes. "</i>

58
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,263
<i>He made me look at things</i> <i>differently.</i>

59
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:53,010
David, this is a steal. Nobody even knows about it yet.

60
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,603
- It's beautiful. - You could build a house here.

61
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,739
Make a name for yourself.

62
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,751
The house will be brilliant because it will be a David Murphy house.

63
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:04,380
<i>I found an incredible property</i> <i>in Santa Monica by the ocean.</i>

64
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,391
<i>It was the perfect site</i> <i>for David's house.</i>

65
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,155
- How are we supposed to do it? - Borrow money, like everybody else.

66
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:13,061
I'm telling you, these leverage- stockbroker-buyout guys...

67
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:14,689
You should see the junk they buy.

68
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,735
They would go crazy for a house of yours.

69
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:21,533
<i>It was brilliant, even though I</i> <i>didn't understand a word of it.</i>

70
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,071
<i>We had to tighten our belts</i> <i>for the loan payments...</i>

71
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:28,203
<i>but it was our future,</i> <i>and I got to build my house.</i>

72
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,713
<i>Then the recession hit.</i>

73
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,050
<i>The real estate market dried up...</i>

74
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,590
<i>and I hadrt closed a sale</i> <i>in six months.</i>

75
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,584
<i>Construction fell</i> <i>to its lowest point in years.</i>

76
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:47,153
<i>People were being laid off</i> <i>everywhere, and I was one of them.</i>

77
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:51,100
- I feel really bad about this. - I don't understand. What happened?

78
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,161
The bank has called in the demand note.

79
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,934
Can they do that?

80
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,941
You don't have any income right now...

81
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,443
so they could attach your assets.

82
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,575
What assets?

83
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,280
Your house.

84
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:11,653
Gotta keep up those payments.

85
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,254
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,506
David, I'm scared.

87
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,245
We don't have any money.

88
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,278
What are we gonna do?

89
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,920
I'll wait tables or drive a cab or something.

90
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,730
I'll take care of you.

91
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,336
Make it go away.

92
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:12,382
<i>I was desperate.</i>

93
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,384
<i>We stood to lose everything...</i>

94
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:16,647
<i>the house I'd been building,</i> <i>even our own home.</i>

95
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:21,890
<i>I swallowed my pride and borrowed</i> <i>$5,000 from my father.</i>

96
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,222
<i>It wasrt enough.</i>

97
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:26,889
<i>We needed $50,000.</i>

98
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:32,135
Money...

99
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,968
D.

100
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,979
- What? - Get up. Get dressed.

101
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,572
- What's the matter? - I got an idea. Come on.

102
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,584
- What time is it? - Chop, chop.

103
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:16,402
Hi! How you doing? Okay! Cigars. Cigarettes.

104
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:17,607
Lighted yo-yos.

105
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,786
- Oh, yeah! - Oh, my God!

106
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,890
Oh, honey. That's the spirit!

107
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:29,984
Keep 'em coming. $50,000! That's what we want! We're winners!

108
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:40,994
Go, skinny, skinny! Put some money in the kitty!

109
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:43,063
Eleven. It's a winner.

110
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:47,177
We got a shooter now, folks. We got a shooter.

111
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:49,213
A lucky, lucky lady shooter. Keep it coming.

112
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,805
- Stack it, don't rack it. - Seven, come!

113
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,849
Nine! Denzel Washington ain't fine!

114
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,691
- All set, folks? - Who's the one?

115
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:23,639
And I have...

116
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,360
Why don't you put it on?

117
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:55,634
It suits you.

118
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,633
Well, I can't afford it.

119
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,477
That's too bad.

120
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:05,311
Yup.

121
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,518
I really think you oughta have the dress.

122
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:14,815
Let me buy it for you.

123
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:17,861
You want to buy me this dress?

124
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,362
Yeah.

125
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,098
Why?

126
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,498
I've enjoyed watching you.

127
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:25,934
You've earned it.

128
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,607
No, I haven't.

129
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:36,112
The dress is for sale. I'm not.

130
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,251
Boom! Skinny, skinny!

131
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,886
We got a new shooter now. Coming out. Seven.

132
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,451
Roll 'em now, girlfriend.

133
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,856
Seven!

134
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,573
Come on now! Come on now!

135
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:07,099
- How are you doing? - Can't lose. I'm up over $9,000.

136
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,941
I can't believe it!

137
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:18,244
- It's so great! - Hey, this is my wife, D.

138
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:21,723
These are my girls. They're gonna be moving in.

139
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,493
Kiss 'em.

140
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,501
I'm winning 'cause we're winners!

141
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,901
Skinny, skinny!

142
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,206
- Did I ever tell you I love you? - No.

143
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:45,442
- I do. - Still?

144
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:46,949
Always.

145
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,566
Five thousand.

146
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,903
This little pile here? You guessed it.

147
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:14,240
Five more, D. What do you think this is?

148
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:15,279
Five more.

149
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,440
Play with it, roll around with it. Enjoy yourself.

150
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,017
Oh, my.

151
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:26,083
And the grand total is...

152
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:32,895
$25,040.

153
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:36,229
So we're halfway there, like, in an hour.

154
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,234
I figure about...

155
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,167
two hours tomorrow, we'll be home free.

156
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,707
Come here.

157
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,652
What?

158
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,563
I love you.

159
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:12,735
I know that.

160
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:16,801
No, I mean even without the money.

161
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,434
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

162
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:58,237
Come on, black. Here we go. Here we go.

163
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:01,544
Yes!

164
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,085
All right. Double zero.

165
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,748
No more bets, please.

166
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,030
Yes. We won.

167
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,993
Forty-one hundred.

168
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,121
We said we wouldn't go below 5,000.

169
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:56,166
- Do you want any more coffee? - No, thank you.

170
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:16,448
Tails, we quit; heads, we go for it.

171
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:38,307
Two out of three.

172
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,378
Last call for wagers.

173
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:44,374
No more bets.

174
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,714
Okay, I'm feeling lucky. I say we put it on red.

175
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:50,845
All of it. Red.

176
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:53,718
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

177
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,657
We can do this, huh?

178
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:02,363
I'm going to put it all. All right.

179
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,393
I'm puttir it on red.

180
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,905
Okay.

181
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,488
No, it's black.

182
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,086
- What are you doing? - It's black.

183
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,894
No, it's red. It's red.

184
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,099
Go with your instinct, right?

185
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:46,405
- No more bets. - Come on, red.

186
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,338
Gotta get it.

187
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,511
Come on, red. Come on, red.

188
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,586
Too late, young lady.

189
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:46,101
Place your bets.

190
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,162
Bank side, player side. All set?

191
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,673
Cards, please.

192
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:55,809
Turning for the players.

193
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,973
Pass is to the right, please.

194
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,518
Player draws nothing.

195
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,660
Player has zero.

196
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:16,165
And set.

197
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:19,836
Player side, banker side.

198
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,929
- Any other bets? - Who's that guy?

199
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:25,532
That's John Gage.

200
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,272
He's a damn billionaire. That's a rich son of a bitch there.

201
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,109
He's down over a million dollars already.

202
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,811
See them little gold things he's playing with?

203
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:37,285
Ten thousand dollars apiece.

204
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,449
Every time he lays one down, 10,000 big ones.

205
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,458
Look at him, how cool he is.

206
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:45,290
That son of a bitch must get more pussy than you can shake a stick at.

207
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,126
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend.

208
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,132
- Player wins. - What y'all doing, gambling?

209
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,725
It's about time.

210
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:54,532
- Y'all married? - Let's go.

211
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,835
- Stick around, gamble a little. - Excuse me.

212
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,173
Excuse me.

213
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:02,639
Would you mind lending me your wife?

214
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,738
Is that your wife?

215
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,214
Excuse me?

216
00:23:07,985 --> 00:23:09,475
For luck.

217
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,012
You'd have to ask her.

218
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:14,918
May I?

219
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,861
- Go for it. - I don't think it's a good idea.

220
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:21,420
- We should just go. - Just for a moment?

221
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:23,933
- I'll go. - Go ahead. It might be fun.

222
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,696
What do we got to lose?

223
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,567
- Well? - He ain't gonna bite.

224
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:30,106
You go and see what happens.

225
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:32,165
- Go ahead. - We'll be here backing you up.

226
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,669
Thank you.

227
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:37,839
See if she can get a little of that money from him.

228
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:40,281
Do you think she'll ever come back?

229
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,453
I'm just bullshittir you.

230
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:47,690
Have a seat.

231
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:51,091
I've been losing all day long. You appeared, I win my first hand.

232
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:53,790
You brought me luck.

233
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:56,355
I'd say that's a sign.

234
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,459
Wouldrt you?

235
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:03,739
- Would you like a drink? - No, thank you.

236
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,241
Candy?

237
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,139
Place your bets.

238
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:13,649
- Bank side, player side. - Hundred thousand.

239
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,084
- Any other bets? - Just like that?

240
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,222
- Just like that. - All bets set.

241
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,453
Twenty-dollar tie-in.

242
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:25,987
Not like that.

243
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,764
Sorry.

244
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:34,899
All bets set. Cards, please.

245
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:39,942
Turning for the players.

246
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,443
What we want...

247
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:45,576
what we need... is a nine.

248
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,848
We don't like that.

249
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,689
Player draws nothing. Cards for the bank, please.

250
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,788
Bank's a winner with a natural eight. Pay the bank.

251
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,570
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.

252
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:09,333
Do you like cards?

253
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:11,435
Not especially.

254
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,977
Wish I had asked you sooner.

255
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,170
Dice?

256
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,541
Yeah, I guess so.

257
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:23,511
Sam.

258
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,145
Mr. G.

259
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,452
One.

260
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,127
Excuse me, Mr. G.

261
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:43,839
- Maybe I should go. - This shouldn't take too long.

262
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:46,138
- What? - This.

263
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:54,450
Now...

264
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,919
I hope you find this interesting.

265
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:01,216
Pit. Tadross.

266
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:02,884

267
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,962
Yes, sir, it's here now.

268
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:06,392
Yes, sir.

269
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:11,590
- I'll take it. - I understand.

270
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,065
Yes, sir. Thank you.

271
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:17,697
Goes for $ 1 million.

272
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:19,708
It's a bet.

273
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:22,841
That's a lot of money.

274
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:25,507
There you are, Mr. G. One million dollars.

275
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:30,116
Oh, boy!

276
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:54,640
Bet it all.

277
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:59,114
Excuse me.

278
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,759
Coming out. Crap 11 or any 7.

279
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:22,168
This time it is a come out roll. How much goes now? Get 'em down.

280
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,672
Pick two.

281
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:32,809
Now just throw a seven.

282
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:36,242
You wanna throw an 11, that's all right too.

283
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,426
Arert you forgetting something?

00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:07,341

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,461
I think I should.

289
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:29,802
Credit my account.

290
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:31,966
Excuse me. Excuse me.

291
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,875
Sweetie, that was amazing. That was incredible.

292
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,879
Oh, my God! Unbelievable.

293
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:38,972
Hi. John Gage.

294
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,017
Oh, hi. David Murphy.

295
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:43,245
- Hi, David. - Congratulations.

296
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,254
This is my wife Diana. I guess you met.

297
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:46,653
Hi. Diana?

298
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:49,749
- Diana. - Hi. Thank you both.

299
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:52,889
Very generous of you, David. Are you staying at the hotel?

300
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:55,591
- Actually, we're just leaving. - You're leaving?

301
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:58,099
- We're on our way out. - No, don't do that.

302
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:00,659
We got to celebrate. Let me arrange a room for you here.

303
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:03,865
- That's very nice, but... - I insist.

304
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,807
Please, it's the least I can do. Okay?

305
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:09,141
Really, just sign for it. Anything you want.

306
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:12,943
Oh, there's some lovely shops off the lobby.

307
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:14,847
Have you seen 'em?

308
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,553
Let's go.

309
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,034
How 'bout that?

310
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:37,832
Wow.

311
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:39,933
Hey, D. What do you think?

312
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:43,106
<i>Godfather?</i>

313
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:50,384
You won a million dollars today.

314
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:51,920
He won it.

315
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:54,923
You won it for him.

316
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:04,099
This feels nice.

317
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,661
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

318
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:10,171
- Okay. - Okay?

319
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:21,707
Hello. William Shackleford.

00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:23,218
Hi. David Murphy.

321

- Oh, well, thank him for us. - I'll do that.

323
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:36,190
Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering tonight at his suite at 9:00.

324
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,201
If you can find the time in your schedule, he'd be most pleased.

325
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,597
- Look what you got. - What?

326
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:47,302
Gift from Gage.

327
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,445
Really?

328
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:52,809
Open it up.

329
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:06,623
That's $5,000.

330
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:09,126
How do you know that?

331
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,068
I saw it in a store downstairs.

332
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:17,298
Oh. Lucky for him you like black.

333
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,468
Yeah.

334
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:41,029
<i>It's not the pale moon</i>

335
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:44,123
<i>That excites me</i>

336
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:50,571
<i>That thrills</i>

337
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,302
<i>And delights me</i>

338
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:58,477
<i>Oh, no</i>

339
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:04,021
<i>It's just the nearness</i>

340
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:08,284
<i>Of you</i>

341
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:17,191
<i>It's not your</i>

342
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,201
<i>Sweet</i>

343
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:23,103
<i>Conversation</i>

344
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:29,209
<i>That brings</i>

345
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,147
<i>This sensation</i>

346
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:36,748
<i>Oh, no</i>

347
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:43,291
<i>It's just the nearness</i>

348
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,954
<i>Of you</i>

349
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:57,436
In the future, just check into a hotel and start all over again.

350
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,571
Stick 'em under the sheets.

351
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:04,803
That's strange. Am I right?

352
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:13,581
- Good night. - Thanks.

353
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:29,198
Who is that guy, Shackleford?

354
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:33,435
Someone who works for me.

355
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,808
Someone I trust.

356
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,816
He killed someone once.

357
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:46,379
Tell me...

358
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:50,290
where do you see yourself in, say, ten years?

359
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:55,559
I wouldn't mind being a billionaire like yourself.

360
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:58,958
Nice shot. I mean, beyond money.

361
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:01,663
What would satisfy you completely, let you sleep well at night?

362
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:05,237
What, are you saying you're not satisfied?

363
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,566
Who is?

364
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,639
I am.

365
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,645
She mean it?

366
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,084
I hope so.

367
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:21,188
Well, then you may not have won in Vegas, but you're a lucky man...

368
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:23,522
'cause I got money, security, I have businesses...

369
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:27,188
but you have something that I just don't have.

370
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:30,256
I guess there's limits to what money can buy.

371
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:32,528
Not many.

372
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:36,171
Some things aren't for sale.

373
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,166
Such as?

374
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,838
You can't buy people.

375
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,678
That's naive, Diana. I buy people every day.

376
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,117
In business, maybe, but not when real emotions are involved.

377
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:54,555
You're saying you can't buy love? That's a bit of a clich?

378
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:57,588
It's absolutely true.

379
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,094
Is it?

380
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:01,153
What do you think?

381
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:03,961
- I agree with Diana. - You do?

382
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,561
Let's test the clich?

383
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:13,241
Suppose...

384
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:17,111
I were to offer you $ 1 million...

385
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:22,251
for one night with your wife.

386
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:30,385
I'd assume you're kidding.

387
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,394
Let's pretend I'm not.

388
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:36,091
What would you say?

389
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:40,329
He'd tell you to go to hell.

390
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:44,470
I didn't hear him.

391
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:47,833
I'd tell you to go to hell.

392
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:03,288
That's a reflex answer because you view it as hypothetical.

393
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,158
But let's say that there were real money behind it.

394
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,490
I'm not kidding.

395
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,728
A million dollars.

396
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:16,135
The night would come and go, but the money could last a lifetime.

397
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:18,140
Think of it.

398
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,143
A million dollars.

399
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:25,581
A lifetime of security...

400
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:27,480
for one night.

401
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:31,418
Don't answer right away.

402
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:32,978
But consider it.

403
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:35,888
Seriously.

404
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:39,557
We're positive, okay?

405
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:46,099
Then you've answered my question and you've proved your point.

406
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:49,502
There are limits to what money can buy.

407
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:52,769
It's late, and I hate to admit it, but I have a meeting.

408
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:56,541
May I have one dance?

409
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:59,446
Of course, with your permission.

410
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:01,882
You know something? I think you better get on to that meeting.

411
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,044
You don't want to miss out on your next billion.

412
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:08,522
Understood. I wouldn't part with her either.

413
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:12,694
Good night.

414
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:11,085
Can't sleep?

415
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:15,556
No.

416
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,893
Me neither.

417
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:28,226
I just keep thinking about it.

418
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,065
It's so weird, isn't it?

419
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:37,211
Yeah.

420
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:45,913
David, I think you want me to do it.

421
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:52,593
What are you talking about?

422
00:38:53,662 --> 00:38:55,755
Don't be ridiculous.

423
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,265
Well, maybe we should just talk about it.

424
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:02,861
I don't want you to do it.

425
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:11,377
- But you'd let me do it? - No.

426
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:20,015
Why? Do you want to do it?

427
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,357
No.

428
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:27,461
But I would.

429
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:30,388
I'd do it for you.

430
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:34,568
For me?

431
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,244
I can't believe we're even talkir about this.

432
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:51,851
Think about what this money could do for us...

433
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:54,082
what it could do for our future.

434
00:39:56,725 --> 00:39:59,558
You could finish your house.

435
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:01,755
You could pay your dad back...

436
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:04,832
get rid of our debts.

437
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:09,093
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

438
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:11,401
It's just my body.

439
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:13,408
It's not my mind.

440
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,103
It's not my heart.

441
00:40:17,746 --> 00:40:21,113
You think we could do something like that?

442
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,455
We both slept with other people before we were married, right?

443
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:32,960
Yeah.

444
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:36,960
So we'd just have to look at it like that.

445
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,463
I slept with Bubba Aruzio, for God's sake.

446
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,473
If I can sleep with Bubba, I can sleep with anyone.

447
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:48,476
- You slept with Bubba? - You knew.

448
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,206
No, I didn't know that. When did you sleep with Bubba?

449
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:55,912
When you were off sleeping with that slut, Olivia Daigle.

450
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:58,146
Olivia Deagle. And she wasrt a slut.

451
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,780
Olivia Beagle.

452
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:02,517
Let me in.

453
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:04,422
- She wasrt a slut. - Yes, she was.

454
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:05,926
- She wasrt. - She was.

455
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:07,758
She wasrt.

456
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,263
Unfortunately.

457
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:15,834
Thank God we can laugh about it.

458
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,669
Yeah.

459
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:21,335
That's easy to say now. After...

460
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:29,283
We'd just have to forget it ever happened.

461
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:35,790
And never discuss it, not even once.

462
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,627
I mean, because nothing will have happened.

463
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,359
Nothing that matters, anyway.

464
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:58,636
We have a brilliant script, really very special.

465
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:00,648
- Major. - It's a vehicle...

466
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:02,581
a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.

467
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:04,915
With Billy Ray Cyrus. It's kind of <i>A Star Is Born.</i>

468
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:06,113
So...

469
00:42:06,188 --> 00:42:08,554
your first screenplay sold for half a million.

470
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:11,559
- Should've been two. - Except our lawyer caved in on us.

471
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:13,060
That won't happen again.

472
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:15,323
We're gonna get a lawyer that's tough, that's savvy.

473
00:42:15,397 --> 00:42:18,059
Someone who will step on his grandmother for us.

474
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,062
<i>Mr. Green, a David Murphy</i> <i>would like to speak to you.</i>

475
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:24,071
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

476
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:26,266
Put him on the speaker. This is an old college buddy.

477
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:28,572
- It'll only take a second. <i>- Jeremy?</i>

478
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:31,272
Davey, I'm in the middle of a meeting. What's up?

479
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:33,872
<i>Well, listen,</i> <i>we need you to close a deal.</i>

480
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:36,417
- What kind of deal? <i>- A very big deal.</i>

481
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:38,419
Ooh, big deal. Go on.

482
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:40,978
<i>We're in Vegas at the Hilton.</i>

483
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:43,650
<i>We met John Gage.</i> <i>You know who he is?</i>

484
00:42:43,726 --> 00:42:48,095
Sure, I know who he is. A billionaire and major poon hound.

485
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:50,591
<i>He is?</i>

486
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,133
Go on.

487
00:42:52,201 --> 00:42:54,533
<i>He offered us a million dollars.</i>

488
00:42:54,603 --> 00:42:57,766
Million dollars? For what, your kidneys?

489
00:42:59,975 --> 00:43:02,239
<i>For one night with Diana.</i>

490
00:43:05,547 --> 00:43:07,481
What do you mean?

491
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:10,347
- One night, like... <i>- Yes.</i>

492
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,855
Could you excuse me for a second?

493
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:22,763
Let me get this straight.

494
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,530
He offered you a million dollars for a night with your wife?

495
00:43:26,602 --> 00:43:28,536
As in your wife Diana?

496
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:31,869
And you agreed to it? I don't know what to say.

497
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,408
How could you do something like that?

498
00:43:34,476 --> 00:43:36,410
How could you negotiate without me?

499
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:39,276
Never negotiate without your lawyer. Never!

500
00:43:39,348 --> 00:43:41,646
For a woman like Diana, I could have got you at least two million!

501
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,120
Obviously, you don't want to get screwed, and then screwed.

502
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:49,885
Hey, stay, please. This is damage control.

503
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,949
Two seconds. Eat cookies. There's cookies coming.

504
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:53,619
You don't understand. We've heard enough.

505
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:55,926
- You're hired. - We love your style.

506
00:43:55,998 --> 00:43:58,626
Great. Gladys, check the gentlemers schedules.

507
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:01,169
- Call me next week. Wednesday? - Great.

508
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:02,635
See you then. Thanks for coming.

509
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:05,071
- No. Thank you. - No. Thank you.

510
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,733
Okay, David, before we go any further...

511
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:12,907
let's get the moral issue out of the way.

512
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:15,575
<i>- Leave that to us.</i> - I was referring to my fee.

513
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:17,278
I get five percent.

514
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:21,253
Do you want to elaborate on the verification clause?

515
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:23,257
Verification.

516
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:27,596
That means you pay even if the relationship isn't consummated.

517
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:31,124
You mean, if I'm impotent.

518
00:44:31,933 --> 00:44:34,595
It's important for a lawyer to cover contingencies.

519
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:36,999
I can live with that.

520
00:44:37,072 --> 00:44:39,006
The John Garfield clause?

521
00:44:39,074 --> 00:44:42,043
That's if you die in the act.

522
00:44:45,246 --> 00:44:48,272
I have no problem with that either. Can I have your pen?

523
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,058
- You're pretty good, you know? - Thank you.

524
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:01,891
You should come work for me.

525
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:14,741
We have a deal.

526
00:45:18,913 --> 00:45:21,507
A million dollars will be deposited in your casino account...

527
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,346
in the morning.

528
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:29,915
So.

529
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,921
So.

530
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:36,425
So.

531
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,858
You can go.

532
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:42,232
Gentlemen...

533
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:44,999
I think it's time for men of good will to...

534
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:47,405
take leave of one another.

535
00:46:13,635 --> 00:46:15,899
It's all right.

536
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,063
I don't bite.

537
00:46:20,475 --> 00:46:21,908
So...

538
00:46:23,378 --> 00:46:25,312
what, should I go undress?

539
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:34,053
Cheer up. You got to find a more creative way to think about this.

540
00:46:34,122 --> 00:46:38,616
Look at it like an episode of <i>The Dating Game</i> that went awry.

541
00:46:38,693 --> 00:46:41,491
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

542
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:44,589
<i>we wish to welcome you</i> <i>to ourjamboree.</i>

543
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:47,499
First punch, over he went. I couldn't believe it.

544
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:50,732
I know we could have gotten two million.

545
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:52,238
Here's your Buddha.

546
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:54,935
Davey, no point getting out the crying towel.

547
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:56,806
You got a million bucks, buddy.

548
00:46:56,878 --> 00:46:59,039
A million bucks.

549
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:01,844
<i>Take the ribbon from your hair</i>

550
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:04,976
She's an amazing woman. She really is.

551
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:07,021
Couldrt have gotten 500 for my girlfriend.

552
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:09,022
Not that I'd do that.

553
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,820
But it's okay that you did.

554
00:47:11,893 --> 00:47:14,123
This is a different situation.

555
00:47:14,195 --> 00:47:16,425
She agreed to it. You've gotta remember that.

556
00:47:16,498 --> 00:47:19,262
It's not like it's hard duty.

557
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:20,801
He's a great-looking guy.

558
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:23,963
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

559
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,438
Maybe not.

560
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:29,841
Hey, buddy!

561
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:43,621
Come on.

562
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,233
Come on!

563
00:47:56,604 --> 00:47:58,868
What have I done?

564
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:14,379
D!

565
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:16,685
It's me!

566
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:26,098
Where is she? Where's my wife?

567
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:29,532
Where is she?

568
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:33,499
Diana!

569
00:48:34,976 --> 00:48:36,443
Please!

570
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:38,445
Where did she go? What happened to her?

571
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:40,845
- Where'd they go? - Up, up.

572
00:48:40,915 --> 00:48:42,542
Up where?

573
00:49:03,438 --> 00:49:04,871
D!

574
00:53:37,177 --> 00:53:39,338
They sent for me.

575
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:41,346
They said you were ready.

576
00:53:54,828 --> 00:53:56,489
Come here.

577
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:21,078
You missed a button.

578
00:54:28,662 --> 00:54:30,857
Thank you.

579
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:35,233
I want to show you something.

580
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:51,779
What happened?

581
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:55,377
Lights went off.

582
00:54:57,357 --> 00:54:59,825
I see that. Why?

583
00:55:03,463 --> 00:55:04,896
Look.

584
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:13,300
Can you turn those off too?

585
00:55:16,476 --> 00:55:18,410
I'm working on it.

586
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:25,645
Who made the decision?

587
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:31,087
We both did.

588
00:55:31,157 --> 00:55:32,624
Nah.

589
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,190
Do it for your own reasons, or don't do it.

590
00:55:38,398 --> 00:55:41,265
- You don't know him. - I know he didn't stop you.

591
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,593
If you were mine...

592
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:50,102
I wouldn't share you with anyone.

593
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:59,318
You have no right to judge David.

594
00:56:01,888 --> 00:56:04,482
You're the one who has to buy women.

595
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:06,491
You think I have to buy women?

596
00:56:11,464 --> 00:56:13,398
Why me, then?

597
00:56:13,466 --> 00:56:15,900
I bought you because you said you couldn't be bought.

598
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:20,903
I can't be bought.

599
00:56:20,974 --> 00:56:23,408
We're just gonna fuck, as I understand it.

600
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:27,209
You might enjoy it.

601
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:30,549
Don't bet on it.

602
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:35,587
I think I will.

603
00:56:40,994 --> 00:56:42,928
Heads, we do...

604
00:56:42,996 --> 00:56:45,931
tails, we call the whole thing off, turn the boat around, go home.

605
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:47,557
No hard feelings.

606
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:50,696
What do you say?

607
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:53,764
It's your party.

608
00:56:55,842 --> 00:56:57,776
This is my lucky dollar...

609
00:56:59,012 --> 00:57:00,707
so I can't lose.

610
00:57:22,802 --> 00:57:24,099
Trust me.

611
00:57:25,805 --> 00:57:28,569
Nothing's gonna happen you don't choose.

612
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:44,970
- I love you. - I love you.

613
01:00:00,995 --> 01:00:03,259
<i>I told myself it was over...</i>

614
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,094
<i>like a dream that vanishes</i> <i>in the morning light...</i>

615
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:08,498
<i>And in time... enough time...</i>

616
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:10,500
<i>I would forget.</i>

617
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:26,349
Yeah.

618
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:29,552
All right.

619
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:36,016
A little fixer-upper south of Wilshire.

620
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:38,028
It's nothing. Yeah.

621
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:40,987
I've got people here.

622
01:00:41,766 --> 01:00:43,825
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

623
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:44,833
Sorry.

624
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:47,132
I'm here for you now.

625
01:00:47,205 --> 01:00:49,935
All right, two acres on Alta Loma.

626
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:52,168
- Alta Vista. - Vista. That's right.

627
01:00:52,243 --> 01:00:53,574
Murphy property.

628
01:00:54,445 --> 01:00:57,175
We've been a little late on the payments, want to settle up.

629
01:00:57,849 --> 01:00:59,942
I don't think that's possible.

630
01:01:00,985 --> 01:01:02,077
What do you mean?

631
01:01:02,153 --> 01:01:04,280
The mortgage is two months in default...

632
01:01:04,355 --> 01:01:08,883
and it appears that the property is in contract to another party.

633
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:11,686
To another party?

634
01:01:11,762 --> 01:01:13,320
- Who? - That's privileged information.

635
01:01:13,397 --> 01:01:16,423
How can that be? We called specifically for an extension.

636
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:19,231
The extension expired two days ago.

637
01:01:19,303 --> 01:01:22,295
If you don't make a payment, the bank can repossess.

638
01:01:22,373 --> 01:01:24,170
Without prior notice?

639
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:26,608
Can they do that?

640
01:01:26,677 --> 01:01:28,304
They don't have to warn us.

641
01:01:28,379 --> 01:01:31,314
But, in fact, an attempt was made to call you on the third...

642
01:01:31,382 --> 01:01:33,942
and a registered letter, return receipt requested...

643
01:01:34,018 --> 01:01:35,451
was attempted on the fourth.

644
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,454
Apparently there was no one home.

645
01:01:37,522 --> 01:01:39,183
We were out of town.

646
01:01:39,257 --> 01:01:41,316
Well, I am sorry...

647
01:01:41,392 --> 01:01:43,656
but you snooze, you lose.

648
01:01:45,897 --> 01:01:47,330
"You snooze, you lose."

649
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,960
"You snooze, you lose"?

650
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:53,503
- It's an expression. - Oh, that's beautiful.

651
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,164
Bullshit!

652
01:01:59,143 --> 01:02:00,804
This is bullshit, man!

653
01:02:00,878 --> 01:02:02,470
Don't deal with these people.

654
01:02:02,547 --> 01:02:05,482
They sold us out. They'll sell you out too.

655
01:02:50,962 --> 01:02:53,362
Hi. Wanna help me in the garden?

656
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,329
Okay.

657
01:03:06,143 --> 01:03:09,078
Our tomatoes are looking good. Don't you think?

658
01:03:11,716 --> 01:03:13,149
David?

659
01:03:16,387 --> 01:03:18,412
What's "Gryphon"?

660
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,323
<i>Gryphon.</i>

661
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,255
Where'd you hear that name?

662
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,623
You have a box of matches.

663
01:03:31,202 --> 01:03:33,432
We said we wouldn't talk about it.

664
01:03:33,504 --> 01:03:36,064
Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

665
01:03:38,009 --> 01:03:39,442
Don't you?

666
01:03:40,611 --> 01:03:42,044
No.

667
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:43,740
D.

668
01:03:46,017 --> 01:03:49,509
I thought I could forget about this, but I can't.

669
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:51,020
So I think...

670
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:55,723
maybe if we just talk about it we can put it behind us.

671
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,925
<i>Gryphors</i> a boat.

672
01:04:05,436 --> 01:04:07,870
He took you to a boat?

673
01:04:07,938 --> 01:04:10,406
- In Nevada? - We flew to Santa Barbara.

674
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:13,642
- What kind of boat? - A big boat.

675
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:15,144
And then what?

676
01:04:15,212 --> 01:04:16,611
And then nothing.

677
01:04:19,783 --> 01:04:22,752
Where did you get the matches? Have you been going through my bag?

678
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:23,980
No.

679
01:04:27,558 --> 01:04:29,492
Why? What's in your bag?

680
01:04:30,294 --> 01:04:33,229
I'm not gonna talk about this. I'm not gonna do it.

681
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:12,185
What?

682
01:06:13,697 --> 01:06:15,756
Who are you talking to?

683
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,897
My mother.

684
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:21,265
And what did Mom have to say?

685
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,365
Nothing. She wasrt there.

686
01:06:25,442 --> 01:06:29,708
You said you were talking to her. How could you if she wasrt there?

687
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,146
Well, I was trying to talk to her...

688
01:06:32,216 --> 01:06:33,877
but I didn't reach her.

689
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:35,885
She wasrt in after 10:00?

690
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:39,013
No. If you don't believe me, would you like to talk to her yourself?

691
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,955
What is the matter with you?

692
01:06:52,169 --> 01:06:53,466
What is that?

693
01:06:53,537 --> 01:06:55,528
You know what it is.

694
01:06:58,909 --> 01:07:01,104
- Where did you get this? - In your wallet.

695
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:03,745
I've never seen it before.

696
01:07:03,814 --> 01:07:06,612
- It was in the secret compartment. - I don't even use that.

697
01:07:06,683 --> 01:07:08,947
- Have you been seeing him? - No, I haven't.

698
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:11,886
- You can't stop thinking about him. - You won't let me.

699
01:07:13,123 --> 01:07:15,717
- Why were you in my wallet, anyway? - I don't trust you.

700
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:19,319
- Well, I don't trust you either. - Well, then we're even.

701
01:07:28,572 --> 01:07:30,506
<i>I had to do something.</i>

702
01:07:30,574 --> 01:07:33,509
<i>I wanted to make something good</i> <i>out of all we'd done wrong.</i>

703
01:07:33,577 --> 01:07:36,512
<i>I decided to try</i> <i>and buy our land back.</i>

704
01:07:38,882 --> 01:07:40,315
Alta Vista.

705
01:07:40,384 --> 01:07:43,410
I need to find out the guy's name. I wanna make him an offer.

706
01:07:44,588 --> 01:07:46,886
I'm gonna get killed for this, Diana.

707
01:07:46,957 --> 01:07:50,825
I don't want you to get in trouble. I really appreciate it.

708
01:07:50,894 --> 01:07:53,260
There it is. Right there.

709
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:54,991
- Back up. - Here we go.

710
01:07:55,065 --> 01:07:57,556
543 Alta Vista.

711
01:07:59,069 --> 01:08:00,161
Oh, my God.

712
01:08:00,237 --> 01:08:02,831
This guy's never gonna sell.

713
01:08:02,906 --> 01:08:05,500
I just saw this guy on TV.

714
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:47,740
You bastard! You stole our property!

715
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:51,987
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a friend...

716
01:08:52,055 --> 01:08:53,249
I'm not your friend.

717
01:08:54,224 --> 01:08:57,022
Diana advised me on a piece of property in Santa Monica.

718
01:08:57,094 --> 01:08:59,528
You're a liar. You took it, and I want it back.

719
01:08:59,596 --> 01:09:02,724
Can we have a... Everything's fine. Everything's under control.

720
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:04,061
Very well, sir.

721
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:07,335
Excuse me.

722
01:09:15,078 --> 01:09:17,012
I'm taking it off.

723
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,547
Wait a minute.

724
01:09:21,618 --> 01:09:25,384
- Did you just want to hurt me? - Nonsense. I think you're wonderful.

725
01:09:25,455 --> 01:09:27,355
- That was our house. - I got there first.

726
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:29,551
I want you to sell it back to me.

727
01:09:29,626 --> 01:09:32,493
- You can't afford it. - Oh? How's a million dollars?

728
01:09:32,562 --> 01:09:34,325
The price is two.

729
01:09:34,398 --> 01:09:36,798
If I had two, the price would be four, right?

730
01:09:36,867 --> 01:09:38,801
I saw an opportunity and I took it.

731
01:09:38,869 --> 01:09:42,828
You had the money and the right instincts, but you were too late.

732
01:09:42,906 --> 01:09:45,466
- I want you to work for me. - You go to hell.

733
01:09:45,542 --> 01:09:47,066
Listen, I mean it.

734
01:09:47,144 --> 01:09:49,135
- Never. - Why not?

735
01:09:50,047 --> 01:09:52,607
- Because I hate you. - No, you don't.

736
01:09:53,884 --> 01:09:56,444
You wish you hated me.

737
01:10:16,573 --> 01:10:18,336
Hi, D.

738
01:10:22,379 --> 01:10:24,313
You look awful.

739
01:10:25,849 --> 01:10:29,114
- Where you been? - I'll tell you about it.

740
01:10:29,186 --> 01:10:31,211
Gonna have some wine first.

741
01:10:34,257 --> 01:10:35,349
Do you want some?

742
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,181
So, where you been?

743
01:11:06,756 --> 01:11:10,852
Last night I was up for hours trying to figure a way out of this mess.

744
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:15,158
And today?

745
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:20,832
And today I saw Gage.

746
01:11:28,911 --> 01:11:31,345
Thank you for your trust, David...

747
01:11:31,414 --> 01:11:32,881
and for listening.

748
01:11:33,516 --> 01:11:34,949
Did you fuck him?

749
01:11:35,017 --> 01:11:36,712
- No. - But you wanted to.

750
01:11:36,786 --> 01:11:39,516
I met him in broad daylight in front of a bunch of rich assholes.

751
01:11:39,589 --> 01:11:40,681
I don't believe you.

752
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:44,021
David, he bought our property. Okay?

753
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:48,189
That's why I went to see him... to find some way to get it back.

754
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:52,868
You have no reason to be jealous. I hate him.

755
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:58,164
- Tell me what happened on that boat. - Don't do this!

756
01:11:58,241 --> 01:11:59,173
Why?

757
01:11:59,242 --> 01:12:01,107
'Cause I want to know.

758
01:12:01,177 --> 01:12:04,772
All right, I'll tell you. The man was a fucking stallion.

759
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:07,907
Should I say we did it all night? Does that do it for you?

760
01:12:07,984 --> 01:12:10,817
- Is that the truth? - You don't want the fucking truth.

761
01:12:10,887 --> 01:12:12,821
You want me to lie.

762
01:12:12,889 --> 01:12:15,756
So I'll tell you he's awful, and you won't believe me.

763
01:12:15,825 --> 01:12:18,385
Just tell me the truth, D.

764
01:12:18,461 --> 01:12:20,156
It was sex, David.

765
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:22,060
Just sex. Not love.

766
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:24,292
Was it good sex?

767
01:12:24,367 --> 01:12:26,767
- Don't do this. - Can you just tell me that?

768
01:12:26,836 --> 01:12:29,862
What are you hesitating for? Just tell me. Was it good?

769
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:31,873
Was it good? Was it good?

770
01:12:32,742 --> 01:12:34,175
Yes.

771
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,210
David.

772
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:55,288
Don't tell me it was just sex. You were attracted to him all along.

773
01:12:55,364 --> 01:12:58,765
That's bullshit. David, I did it for you.

774
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,768
Don't you tell me you did it for me.

775
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:03,828
You did it for yourself. You were dying to do it.

776
01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:07,467
I would never do this for myself. It was all for you.

777
01:13:07,543 --> 01:13:09,135
Don't lie to me!

778
01:13:09,212 --> 01:13:11,146
You were attracted to him!

779
01:14:11,874 --> 01:14:14,809
I knew something like this was gonna happen.

780
01:14:14,877 --> 01:14:18,176
I guess you make a deal with the devil...

781
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:20,181
and eventually you pay the price.

782
01:14:20,249 --> 01:14:22,240
Thanks, Jeremy.

783
01:14:22,318 --> 01:14:25,810
Coming from the man who closed the deal, that's very comforting.

784
01:14:29,325 --> 01:14:31,316
Green.

785
01:14:31,394 --> 01:14:32,486
Oh, hi, Di.

786
01:14:33,296 --> 01:14:35,230
I'm not here.

787
01:14:35,298 --> 01:14:38,267
Yeah, he's right here. You wanna speak to him?

788
01:14:38,334 --> 01:14:40,268
No, I don't want to talk to him.

789
01:14:40,336 --> 01:14:42,099
<i>Look, sweetie...</i>

790
01:14:42,171 --> 01:14:44,230
he loves you...

791
01:14:44,307 --> 01:14:45,672
you love him.

792
01:14:45,741 --> 01:14:49,177
You gotta try and work this out. It's all pretty simple, right?

793
01:14:49,245 --> 01:14:51,338
<i>This is a deal</i> <i>even I can't screw up.</i>

794
01:14:51,414 --> 01:14:53,848
Tell him he can keep the money.

795
01:14:55,584 --> 01:14:57,518
I don't want any of it.

796
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:07,622
Davey...

797
01:15:07,697 --> 01:15:09,631
she says she doesn't want the money.

798
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:12,624
I don't want the money either.

799
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:24,302
I'll take it.

800
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:26,575
I mean, if nobody else wants it.

801
01:16:05,788 --> 01:16:08,723
<i>The next few weeks without David</i> <i>felt like months.</i>

802
01:16:10,025 --> 01:16:12,858
<i>I got very good</i> <i>at staring at walls.</i>

803
01:16:12,928 --> 01:16:13,860
Diana.

804
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,690
The recession has ended.

805
01:16:18,768 --> 01:16:22,864
There's a fella out there wants to see ten-million-dollar homes.

806
01:16:22,938 --> 01:16:24,200
There is a God.

807
01:16:29,011 --> 01:16:30,444
Find someone else.

808
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:34,640
Find someone else? Are you nuts?

809
01:16:34,717 --> 01:16:36,708
Do you know what the commission is on $ 10 million?

810
01:16:36,786 --> 01:16:39,016
- I can't do it. - You have to do it.

811
01:16:39,088 --> 01:16:41,386
You're the best one I have.

812
01:16:41,457 --> 01:16:44,949
You're the only one I have. The others are all on caravan.

813
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:54,466
- I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. I can't. - Diana.

814
01:16:54,537 --> 01:16:58,598
I would never dream of forcing you to do anything against your will.

815
01:16:59,842 --> 01:17:01,969
Except this one time.

816
01:17:03,546 --> 01:17:06,140
Now move your ass, or you're fired.

817
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:15,256
If you think this is gonna work, you underestimate me.

818
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:43,351
You are truly beautiful.

819
01:17:45,421 --> 01:17:47,355
What do you think you're doing?

820
01:17:49,692 --> 01:17:51,626
Looking for a house.

821
01:17:56,098 --> 01:17:59,226
Well, there's Bel-Air, Holmby Hills, Benedict Canyon, Pacific Palisades.

822
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:01,166
Where would you like to go first?

823
01:18:01,237 --> 01:18:02,670
Paris.

824
01:18:04,573 --> 01:18:07,007
1120 Bel-Air Road, please.

825
01:18:16,384 --> 01:18:18,318
The ceilings are French gothic.

826
01:18:18,386 --> 01:18:20,786
Renaissance paintings, as you can see.

827
01:18:20,855 --> 01:18:22,823
Parquet floors throughout.

828
01:18:22,891 --> 01:18:24,825
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

829
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,427
This is the master bath.

830
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,264
Why didn't you return any of my calls?

831
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:36,794
Do you like it?

832
01:18:38,406 --> 01:18:39,600
No.

833
01:18:51,953 --> 01:18:53,944
- Thirty million, minimum. - Do you think?

834
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:56,081
- I know. - Well, let's look at it.

835
01:18:56,157 --> 01:18:58,091
It's not for sale.

836
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,627
Everything's for sale.

837
01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:32,292
This is your house, isn't it?

838
01:19:35,029 --> 01:19:36,690
Do you like it?

839
01:19:42,103 --> 01:19:44,469
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

840
01:19:46,307 --> 01:19:48,468
What do you think it needs?

841
01:19:48,543 --> 01:19:50,704
Tell me honestly.

842
01:19:53,648 --> 01:19:55,582
I think it needs a life.

843
01:19:57,118 --> 01:20:00,178
I think it needs furniture...

844
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:02,519
maybe a couple of dogs and flowers.

845
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,023
It needs you.

846
01:20:07,829 --> 01:20:09,922
Just forget it.

847
01:20:09,998 --> 01:20:11,295
It just won't work.

848
01:20:11,366 --> 01:20:13,061
Why not?

849
01:20:14,502 --> 01:20:17,835
Because from where we started, we've got nowhere to go.

850
01:20:17,906 --> 01:20:20,033
You don't know that.

851
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:23,571
I've never started this way either.

852
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:28,245
I need you.

853
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,679
No.

854
01:20:34,756 --> 01:20:36,917
You collect things.

855
01:20:39,894 --> 01:20:41,327
Don't you?

856
01:20:43,097 --> 01:20:44,530
Sometimes.

857
01:20:50,772 --> 01:20:52,205
Yeah.

858
01:21:57,272 --> 01:22:00,207
Even if you were extremely rich...

859
01:22:00,275 --> 01:22:01,742
and extremely smart...

860
01:22:01,809 --> 01:22:03,106
can you be president?

861
01:22:04,178 --> 01:22:06,976
You couldn't be president? Why not?

862
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:11,617
<i>I took a second job teaching</i> <i>citizenship just to keep busy.</i>

863
01:22:15,757 --> 01:22:16,985
Where were you born?

864
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:19,993
I was born in Seoul, Korea.

865
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:21,494
Where was she born?

866
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:25,726
She was born in Seoul, Korea.

867
01:22:32,974 --> 01:22:34,703
Where were you born, Miguel?

868
01:22:37,378 --> 01:22:38,310
Sorry.

869
01:22:39,213 --> 01:22:40,145
Welcome back.

870
01:22:40,214 --> 01:22:42,375
Where were you born?

871
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:44,350
Cuba.

872
01:22:44,419 --> 01:22:47,752
So, how do we say "Cuba" in America?

873
01:22:47,822 --> 01:22:48,754
Cuba.

874
01:22:50,925 --> 01:22:53,086
Hi.

875
01:22:53,161 --> 01:22:56,358
- What are you doing here? - Isn't this the citizenship class?

876
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:58,524
- Yes. - Can I sit in?

877
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:00,859
It's full.

878
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:04,996
Okay.

879
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:11,412
Cuba.

880
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:13,140
Cuba. Thank you.

881
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:32,596
Okay, I have a question for you, Lucy.

882
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:36,728
Excuse me. Is there something you'd like to share with us?

883
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:40,137
I was just saying that you're an amazing woman.

884
01:23:44,212 --> 01:23:46,146
And...

885
01:23:46,214 --> 01:23:47,272
beautiful.

886
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,883
And talented.

887
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,585
And I am crazy about her.

888
01:24:04,298 --> 01:24:06,391
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

889
01:24:06,467 --> 01:24:08,230
I'm trying like hell.

890
01:24:08,903 --> 01:24:10,996
I think maybe you should go.

891
01:24:11,072 --> 01:24:13,006
You want me to go?

892
01:24:17,545 --> 01:24:19,570
Nice people.

893
01:24:19,647 --> 01:24:21,080
They want the dream.

894
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:24,584
They saw it in the flesh tonight.

895
01:24:27,822 --> 01:24:29,756
You have chalk on your face.

896
01:24:33,494 --> 01:24:35,758
I have something I want to show you.

897
01:24:49,811 --> 01:24:52,837
I didn't know whether you liked big ones or little ones.

898
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:59,186
Oh, you're so beautiful. Come here.

899
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:04,782
I didn't have much time to do anything else...

900
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:09,290
but...

901
01:25:09,363 --> 01:25:10,955
it's a start.

902
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:24,839
Dance?

903
01:25:27,948 --> 01:25:29,210
I should go.

904
01:25:34,888 --> 01:25:39,052
I remember once when I was young, I was coming back from someplace.

905
01:25:39,126 --> 01:25:42,061
A movie or something. I was on the subway.

906
01:25:44,031 --> 01:25:47,296
There was a girl sitting across from me.

907
01:25:47,368 --> 01:25:50,303
She was wearing this dress that was buttoned...

908
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,372
clear up right to here.

909
01:25:56,844 --> 01:25:59,779
She was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

910
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,084
I was shy then.

911
01:26:05,152 --> 01:26:08,315
So when she would look at me...

912
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:10,323
I would look away.

913
01:26:12,059 --> 01:26:15,051
Then afterwards, when I would look back...

914
01:26:15,129 --> 01:26:17,393
she would look away.

915
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:21,791
Then I got to where I was gonna get off.

916
01:26:22,536 --> 01:26:24,470
Got off, the doors closed...

917
01:26:26,874 --> 01:26:29,138
and as the train was pulling away...

918
01:26:30,244 --> 01:26:32,542
she looked right at me...

919
01:26:32,613 --> 01:26:35,377
and gave me the most incredible smile.

920
01:26:38,285 --> 01:26:40,116
It was awful.

921
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:42,649
I wanted to tear the doors open.

922
01:26:42,723 --> 01:26:45,157
I went back every night, same time...

923
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:47,893
for two weeks.

924
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:52,431
But she never showed up.

925
01:26:55,169 --> 01:26:57,501
That was 30 years ago...

926
01:26:58,706 --> 01:27:01,140
and I don't think there's a day that goes by...

927
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:03,142
that I don't think about her.

928
01:27:05,446 --> 01:27:07,880
I don't want that to happen again.

929
01:27:14,955 --> 01:27:16,684
Just one dance?

930
01:30:51,104 --> 01:30:53,629
I want a word with you, Gage.

931
01:30:53,707 --> 01:30:57,575
See, what you don't know is, we got a secret, me and Diana.

932
01:30:57,644 --> 01:30:59,168
We're invincible.

933
01:31:00,514 --> 01:31:02,379
Diana, you're so fucking beautiful.

934
01:31:02,449 --> 01:31:04,383
Maybe tomorrow would be better.

935
01:31:04,451 --> 01:31:06,783
Maybe tomorrow would be a better time?

936
01:31:06,853 --> 01:31:08,787
Hey, I got a suggestion for you.

937
01:31:08,855 --> 01:31:11,153
You know that emblem you got?

938
01:31:11,825 --> 01:31:14,089
The gryphon? The eagle?

939
01:31:14,161 --> 01:31:16,721
I don't think that's a good idea. I got a better idea.

940
01:31:16,797 --> 01:31:18,355
- Shall I? - It's all right.

941
01:31:18,432 --> 01:31:19,899
How about the cuckoo?

942
01:31:19,967 --> 01:31:21,400
You know? Because...

943
01:31:21,468 --> 01:31:23,561
I'm talking to you for a second.

944
01:31:23,637 --> 01:31:26,834
The cuckoo is interesting because it doesn't have its own nest...

945
01:31:26,907 --> 01:31:30,775
so it moves into other birds' nests and it destroys their eggs.

946
01:31:30,844 --> 01:31:32,436
David, stop. Just...

947
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,913
You don't love me anymore?

948
01:31:43,023 --> 01:31:45,617
Have I ever told you I love you?

949
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,922
Have a nice dinner.

950
01:31:55,002 --> 01:31:56,435
Help him.

951
01:31:58,138 --> 01:31:59,935
Go inside.

952
01:32:00,007 --> 01:32:01,440
Got him?

953
01:34:33,093 --> 01:34:35,027
You've done a lot since USC.

954
01:34:37,064 --> 01:34:38,964
First in your class...

955
01:34:39,032 --> 01:34:42,559
AIA award, <i>Prix de Rome.</i>

956
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:45,433
Yeah.

957
01:34:46,206 --> 01:34:47,867
Why would you want this job?

958
01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:52,237
Well, I want to work.

959
01:34:55,749 --> 01:34:57,649
Overqualified.

960
01:34:57,718 --> 01:34:59,652
Fine. Exploit me.

961
01:35:36,723 --> 01:35:40,022
<i>Great architecture is only</i> <i>gonna come from your passion.</i>

962
01:35:40,093 --> 01:35:41,924
And even that won't assure you a job.

963
01:35:41,995 --> 01:35:45,829
Louis Kahn died in a mers room in Penn Station...

964
01:35:45,899 --> 01:35:48,367
and for days no one claimed the body.

965
01:35:48,435 --> 01:35:50,869
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

966
01:35:50,938 --> 01:35:53,168
The money men did not weep...

967
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:56,038
because the great ones are impossible to deal with.

968
01:35:56,109 --> 01:35:57,474
They're a pain in the ass...

969
01:35:57,544 --> 01:36:01,207
because they know that if they do their jobs properly...

970
01:36:01,281 --> 01:36:03,772
if they just this once get it right...

971
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:06,785
they can actually lift the human spirit...

972
01:36:06,853 --> 01:36:08,445
take it to a higher place.

973
01:36:13,827 --> 01:36:15,124
What is this?

974
01:36:15,195 --> 01:36:16,389
A brick.

975
01:36:17,864 --> 01:36:20,298
Good. What else?

976
01:36:20,367 --> 01:36:22,335
A weapon.

977
01:36:25,505 --> 01:36:29,908
Louis Kahn said even a brick wants to be something.

978
01:36:36,783 --> 01:36:40,810
A brick wants to be something.

979
01:36:43,056 --> 01:36:45,024
It aspires.

980
01:36:51,632 --> 01:36:53,930
Even a common, ordinary brick...

981
01:36:54,001 --> 01:36:56,435
wants to be something more than it is.

982
01:37:01,808 --> 01:37:04,675
It wants to be something better than it is.

983
01:37:13,487 --> 01:37:15,614
That is what we must be.

984
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:20,792
See you on Friday.

985
01:37:32,773 --> 01:37:34,468
A brick wants to be something, huh?

986
01:37:34,541 --> 01:37:36,600
I'll bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

987
01:37:36,677 --> 01:37:39,145
- What are you doing here? - I missed you.

988
01:37:39,813 --> 01:37:41,144
I missed you too.

989
01:37:41,214 --> 01:37:42,647
Thanks.

990
01:37:47,621 --> 01:37:50,249
- How you doir? - I'm good.

991
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:52,587
Getting it together.

992
01:37:57,931 --> 01:37:59,990
She wants a divorce.

993
01:38:02,936 --> 01:38:04,927
She wants her freedom and...

994
01:38:06,773 --> 01:38:08,832
if you don't contest it...

995
01:38:08,909 --> 01:38:10,536
you get everything...

996
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:13,773
the land, the money, everything.

997
01:38:15,082 --> 01:38:16,515
Where is she?

998
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,153
Hi, everybody!

999
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:27,149
Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly.

1000
01:38:27,227 --> 01:38:28,956
Good-bye, everybody.

1001
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:30,963
You may wonder what you're doing here...

1002
01:38:31,031 --> 01:38:36,663
sitting in the sun as the smell of the zoo wafts past your nostrils.

1003
01:38:36,737 --> 01:38:40,173
The reason you are here is because you are loaded.

1004
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:44,199
But may I say how brilliant it is to see so many with an interest...

1005
01:38:44,277 --> 01:38:46,643
in the preservation of endangered species.

1006
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:50,149
Every year we have this unique way of making money for the cause.

1007
01:38:50,217 --> 01:38:52,151
We auction animals.

1008
01:38:52,219 --> 01:38:54,210
We bid as high as possible...

1009
01:38:54,287 --> 01:38:56,482
and the money goes to sponsor these lovely beasts.

1010
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,490
Let's start with a bang.

1011
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:01,220
We've got a superstar as a first animal.

1012
01:39:01,294 --> 01:39:04,457
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

1013
01:39:04,531 --> 01:39:08,468
The animal itself is far too big and angry to bring along.

1014
01:39:08,601 --> 01:39:09,898
Look at this guy.

1015
01:39:09,969 --> 01:39:15,202
Thousands and thousands of pounds of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

1016
01:39:15,274 --> 01:39:18,641
Weighs slightly less than the average school bus.

1017
01:39:18,711 --> 01:39:21,077
Look at that magnificent beastie.

1018
01:39:21,147 --> 01:39:25,140
To put him in a better light, to relieve you of some serious money...

1019
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,550
Thank you very much.

1020
01:39:28,621 --> 01:39:31,089
We have a kissy-kissy picture.

1021
01:39:32,191 --> 01:39:33,624
Isn't that nice?

1022
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:39,864
Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't even dream of starting the bid...

1023
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:41,490
below $ 10,000.

1024
01:39:41,567 --> 01:39:44,536
- Now, I know it's a lot of money... - Thirty.

1025
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:48,404
Thirty thousand dollars, ladies and gentlemen!

1026
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:52,305
Call me a sentimental old fool.

1027
01:39:52,378 --> 01:39:54,243
Do I hear 35?

1028
01:39:54,313 --> 01:39:57,248
- Thirty-five. - Thirty-five thousand dollars!

1029
01:39:57,316 --> 01:39:59,910
- Forty. - Forty thousand dollars!

1030
01:39:59,986 --> 01:40:02,284
- Forty-five thousand. - Forty-five thousand!

1031
01:40:02,355 --> 01:40:05,756
- Fifty. - Fifty thousand dollars!

1032
01:40:06,759 --> 01:40:09,284
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.

1033
01:40:09,362 --> 01:40:11,125
Fifty thousand once.

1034
01:40:11,197 --> 01:40:13,757
Fifty thousand twice, ladies and gentlemen.

1035
01:40:14,534 --> 01:40:16,263
One million dollars.

1036
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:21,963
- Wow. - Who is he?

1037
01:40:23,209 --> 01:40:24,699
I'm sorry?

1038
01:40:24,777 --> 01:40:27,075
One million dollars.

1039
01:40:29,549 --> 01:40:32,313
Did you say one million dollars, sir?

1040
01:40:33,085 --> 01:40:34,143
Yeah.

1041
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:37,747
Ladies and gentlemen, one million dollars!

1042
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:41,850
Goodness! Would anybody care to top that, ladies and gentlemen?

1043
01:40:42,929 --> 01:40:44,294
I didn't think so.

1044
01:40:44,363 --> 01:40:47,821
In that case, sir, I believe you're the proud owner of a hippo.

1045
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:49,492
Congratulations.

1046
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:04,611
Hello, Diana.

1047
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:08,051
Ladies and gentlemen, the next animal is an ostrich.

1048
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,350
I really wanted you to have that money.

1049
01:41:10,423 --> 01:41:12,948
And I really wanted you to have that hippo.

1050
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:19,296
Maybe you two would like a moment alone.

1051
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:28,165
So can we hear a bid of, maybe, a million?

1052
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:32,142
That was a joke. Start at 30,000. Do I hear 40?

1053
01:41:33,846 --> 01:41:35,643
So.

1054
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:40,115
- How are you... - I hear you're teaching.

1055
01:41:40,186 --> 01:41:42,279
- Go ahead. - I'm sorry.

1056
01:41:43,422 --> 01:41:45,356
Yeah, I'm teaching.

1057
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:51,960
It doesn't pay much, but at least I get to talk about architecture.

1058
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:55,727
You know how I love to talk about architecture.

1059
01:41:55,801 --> 01:41:58,736
Oh, my goodness. Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.

1060
01:41:58,804 --> 01:42:01,739
It's just a little shower. Please!

1061
01:42:01,807 --> 01:42:05,140
A checkbook makes an ideal umbrella.

1062
01:42:05,211 --> 01:42:08,408
Do we have a dolphin? Have we a dolphin or an octopus?

1063
01:42:08,481 --> 01:42:10,813
How about tropical fish?

1064
01:42:10,883 --> 01:42:13,716
I know! You're running home for more cash. I get it.

1065
01:42:13,786 --> 01:42:17,381
Come on, ladies and gentlemen. You can find the money.

1066
01:42:17,456 --> 01:42:20,016
Oh, to hell. I'm gone.

1067
01:42:29,068 --> 01:42:31,263
I have to talk to you about what happened.

1068
01:42:31,337 --> 01:42:34,636
- Don't. Don't. - No, no, no, I have to.

1069
01:42:34,707 --> 01:42:36,368
Just hear me out.

1070
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,843
I think the mistake I made in Vegas...

1071
01:42:42,915 --> 01:42:46,112
was thinking that I could forget what we did.

1072
01:42:48,354 --> 01:42:51,585
I thought we were invincible.

1073
01:42:52,591 --> 01:42:56,220
But now I know that the things people in love do to each other...

1074
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:58,593
they remember.

1075
01:42:58,664 --> 01:43:02,122
If they stay together, it's not because they forget.

1076
01:43:02,201 --> 01:43:04,192
It's because they forgive.

1077
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:12,443
I was just...

1078
01:43:16,015 --> 01:43:18,950
I was just so afraid that you wanted him.

1079
01:43:20,419 --> 01:43:23,718
No, actually I was afraid that you were right to want him.

1080
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:31,422
'Cause I thought he was the better man.

1081
01:43:37,369 --> 01:43:39,803
And I know now he's not.

1082
01:43:41,073 --> 01:43:42,734
He's just got more money.

1083
01:45:15,301 --> 01:45:17,235
I think we should talk.

1084
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:20,004
I am very happy.

1085
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,532
Shackleford.

1086
01:45:23,843 --> 01:45:26,573
Did you ever see me like this?

1087
01:45:26,645 --> 01:45:29,045
Can't say that I have.

1088
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:31,548
Diana is the reason.

1089
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:33,209
Enough for any man.

1090
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:35,344
She is the best of them.

1091
01:45:35,421 --> 01:45:36,854
Absolutely.

1092
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:40,391
You are the best of them.

1093
01:45:41,627 --> 01:45:42,992
The best of them?

1094
01:45:44,063 --> 01:45:46,531
You said I'm the best of them?

1095
01:45:46,599 --> 01:45:48,692
You are.

1096
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:53,067
I don't understand.

1097
01:45:54,573 --> 01:45:57,736
Shackleford, could you explain it to her?

1098
01:45:57,810 --> 01:45:59,243
What?

1099
01:46:00,512 --> 01:46:02,377
I could do that, sir...

1100
01:46:03,549 --> 01:46:07,212
but somehow I feel Ms. Murphy would rather hear it directly from you.

1101
01:46:07,286 --> 01:46:09,982
Okay. All right.

1102
01:46:10,055 --> 01:46:12,751
She's the best of the million-dollar club.

1103
01:46:12,791 --> 01:46:14,026
Obviously.

1104
01:46:17,262 --> 01:46:20,197
- The million-dollar club? - Now you've got it.

1105
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:24,435
You told me you'd never done that before.

1106
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:27,097
How many members would you say there are?

1107
01:46:27,873 --> 01:46:29,807
- Members? - Yeah.

1108
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:33,137
Worldwide?

1109
01:46:33,211 --> 01:46:34,644
Yeah.

1110
01:46:35,914 --> 01:46:37,506
A couple dozen.

1111
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:41,646
Remember the one that wouldn't stop hiccuping?

1112
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:43,017
What?

1113
01:46:43,088 --> 01:46:44,783
The waitress from Oklahoma.

1114
01:46:44,856 --> 01:46:48,417
Every time you came near her she would convulse into hiccups.

1115
01:46:50,495 --> 01:46:52,963
Yeah, I had forgotten.

1116
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:54,464
Quite a night.

1117
01:46:56,234 --> 01:46:57,963
The best thing of it is...

1118
01:46:58,036 --> 01:47:01,028
you know if you're sexually compatible...

1119
01:47:02,107 --> 01:47:04,439
right from the start.

1120
01:47:14,853 --> 01:47:17,515
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

1121
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:49,087
Thank you, John.

1122
01:47:53,024 --> 01:47:54,389
Good-bye.

1123
01:47:55,494 --> 01:47:56,927
Good-bye.

1124
01:47:59,231 --> 01:48:00,698
Oh.

1125
01:48:04,102 --> 01:48:06,002
Here.

1126
01:48:09,875 --> 01:48:11,365
For luck.

1127
01:48:14,779 --> 01:48:16,041
Yeah.

1128
01:48:19,985 --> 01:48:22,044
- Take care of him. - Sure.

1129
01:48:30,795 --> 01:48:32,387
What was all that about?

1130
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,034
I wanted to end it.

1131
01:48:41,406 --> 01:48:45,206
She never would have looked at me the way she did at him.

1132
01:49:36,228 --> 01:49:40,164
<i>Seven years ago David proposed to me</i> <i>on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

1133
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,501
<i>I wanted to go there to remember...</i>

1134
01:49:44,569 --> 01:49:46,503
<i>and start over.</i>

1135
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:54,538
Have I ever told you I love you?

1136
01:51:05,116 --> 01:51:07,084
No.

1137
01:51:11,022 --> 01:51:12,455
I do.

1138
01:51:18,263 --> 01:51:20,026
Still?

1139
01:51:24,002 --> 01:51:25,936
Always.
