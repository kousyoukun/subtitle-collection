00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:38,103
<i>Losing Diana was like losing a part of me.</i>

27
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:43,606
<i>I thought nothing could change the way we felt about each other.</i>

28
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:46,678
<i>I thought we were invincible.</i>

29
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:53,648
<i>Someone once said, "If you want something very badly, set it free."</i>

30
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:57,985
<i>"If it comes back to you, it's yours for ever."</i>

31
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:02,425
<i>"If it doesn't, it was never yours to begin with."</i>

32
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:05,189
<i>I knew one thing.</i>

33
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:07,563
<i>I was David's to begin with.</i>

34
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:09,692
<i>And he was mine.</i>

35
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:14,664
Light up my life...

36
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,558
<i>We met in high school.</i>

37
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:20,446
<i>David was a senior and I was a freshman.</i>

38
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:24,607
<i>After glee club, he'd drive me and my best friend home from school.</i>

39
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:28,378
<i>I used to watch him in the rear-view mirror.</i>

40
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,615
<i>I fell in love with his eyes.</i>

41
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:41,459
<i>When I was 19 David proposed to me on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

42
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,364
<i>Our parents were against it.</i>

43
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,495
<i>They said we were too young, we didn't know each other.</i>

44
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:52,337
<i>But David said that a life without risk is like no life at all.</i>

45
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:54,947
<i>So we eloped.</i>

46
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:17,063
<i>I graduated from architecture school and got a job at a small firm.</i>

47
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,503
<i>Diana helped support us by selling real estate.</i>

48
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:25,176
<i>I spent all my free time working on a design of my own.</i>

49
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:28,679
<i>It summed up everything about architecture that really mattered.</i>

50
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,875
<i>It was my dream house.</i>

51
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:04,951
D?

52
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:11,279
Have I ever told you I love you?

53
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:13,676
No.

54
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:17,195
- I do.
- Still?

55
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:20,096
Always.

56
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:24,866
<i>We had our differences.</i>

57
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:28,588
<i>He'd take his clothes off and leave them on the floor.</i>

58
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:29,831
<i>It made me crazy.</i>

59
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:52,525
What do you think this is?

60
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,524
Leaving your shoes on the table?

61
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,221
I don't need to do your laundry.

62
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:58,502
I will pick it up. Don't get violent.

63
00:04:58,502 --> 00:04:59,594
What about this?

64
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,573
Now, you put that down.

65
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:03,087
You're going to hurt somebody.

66
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:04,802
I am going to hurt somebody?

67
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:07,243
You're out of your mind!

68
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:09,575
OK, now. Fine.

69
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,653
Goddamn it!

70
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:17,848
Now, come on. Let's just relax.

71
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:18,776
Did I hurt you?

72
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,323
No. I am all right.

73
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:21,396
I am sorry.

74
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:24,444
Really? You were kidding?

75
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,474
D, your pants are on fire.

76
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,701
You have no idea.

77
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,793
<i>We had no money, so for entertainment
David showed me architecture he liked.</i>

78
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,992
<i>But sometimes I'd have to ask,</i>

79
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,832
<i>"Why are we looking at</i>
<i>a stupid car wash?"</i>

80
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,305
<i>And he'd just say, "No, not stupid."</i>

81
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:45,070
<i>"Don't just use your eyes."</i>

82
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,203
<i>He made me look at things</i>
<i>differently.</i>

83
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,358
David, this is a steal.

84
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:52,325
It just came in.

85
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:53,918
Nobody knows about it yet.

86
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,316
It's beautiful.

87
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:56,339
Build a house here.

88
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,117
You'd make a name for yourself,

89
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,785
because the house will be brilliant,
being by David Murphy.

90
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:06,228
<i>I found an incredible piece of property in Santa Monica, by the ocean.</i>

91
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:09,130
<i>It was the perfect site for David's house.</i>

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,066
We will borrow the money.

93
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:15,334
These leverage stockbroker buyout guys, you should see the junk they buy.

94
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,638
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

95
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:23,613
<i>It was brilliant, even though I didn't understand a word of it.</i>

96
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:25,945
<i>We had to economise for the loan payments,</i>

97
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,112
<i>but it was our future and I got to build my house.</i>

98
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:35,622
<i>And then the recession hit.</i>

99
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,914
<i>The real-estate market dried up.</i>

100
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,901
<i>I hadn't closed a sale in six months.</i>

101
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,401
<i>Construction fell to its lowest point in years.</i>

102
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:48,064
<i>People were being laid off everywhere, and I was one of them.</i>

103
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:49,722
I feel really bad about this.

104
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:52,008
I don't understand. What happened?

105
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,080
The bank has called in the demand note.

106
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,705
Can they do that?

107
00:07:56,705 --> 00:08:01,344
You don't have any income right now, so they could attach your assets.

108
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:04,485
What assets?

109
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:09,189
Your house.

110
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,597
got to keep up those payments.

111
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,164
I am sorry.

112
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:31,042
David, I am scared.

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,657
We don't have any money.

114
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,214
What are we going to do?

115
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,173
I will wait tables or drive a cab or something.

116
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:48,185
I don't know.

117
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,673
I will take care of you.

118
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,246
Make it go away.

119
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:13,015
<i>I was desperate.</i>

120
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,122
<i>We stood to lose everything:</i>

121
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:18,856
<i>The house I'd been building, even our own home.</i>

122
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:22,798
<i>I swallowed my pride and borrowed $5,000 from my father.</i>

123
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:25,632
<i>It wasn't enough.</i>

124
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,297
<i>We needed $50,000.</i>

125
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:42,648
- D...
- What?

126
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:47,283
- Get up. Get dressed. I got an idea.
- What time is it?

127
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:16,549
Hi! How you doing?

128
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:24,626
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!

129
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,755
Oh, honey!
That's the spirit!

130
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:30,927
Keep them coming! 50,000 of them,
that's what we want! We're winners!

131
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,938
Put some money in the kitty!

132
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:48,013
We got a shooter now, folks.

133
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,952
A lucky lady shooter.

134
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:52,751
Stack it, don't rack it.

135
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,851
And I have a lovely...

136
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:54,732
Why don't you put it on?

137
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:56,604
It suits you.

138
00:12:58,484 --> 00:13:00,679
Well, I can't afford it.

139
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:06,023
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

140
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:13,744
I really think you ought to have the dress.

141
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,725
Let me buy it for you.

142
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,701
You want to buy me this dress?

143
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,601
Yeah.

144
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:25,407
- Why?
- I have enjoyed watching you.

145
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:26,842
You have earned it.

146
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,809
No, I haven't.

147
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:37,020
The dress is for sale. I am not.

148
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:53,599
Roll them now, girlfriend!

149
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:08,019
I can't lose. I am up over $9,000.

150
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:19,262
$9,000 up! This is my wife D.

151
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:20,529
These are my girls.

152
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,688
They're going to be moving in.

153
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,935
Kiss them.

154
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,839
- Yeah.
- Bets, please.

155
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:44,989
- Did I ever tell you I love you?
- No.

156
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,386
- I do.
- Still?

157
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,925
Always.

158
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:09,476
5,000.

159
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,561
This little pile here, you guessed it.

160
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:13,779
Five more, D.

161
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,650
What do you think this is?
Five more.

162
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,628
Play with it. Roll around with it.

163
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:21,842
Enjoy yourself. Oh, my!

164
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:27,560
And the grand total is...

165
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,289
...$25,040.

166
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:37,103
So we're halfway there, like in an hour.

167
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:43,011
I figure about two hours tomorrow, we will be home free.

168
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,616
Come here.

169
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,594
What?

170
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,507
I love you.

171
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,642
I know that.

172
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:18,575
No, I mean even without the money.

173
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:51,224
Last call for wagers.

174
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,459
No more bets.

175
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:58,209
Come on, black, come on.

176
00:17:58,235 --> 00:17:59,169
Here we go.

177
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,444
Yes!

178
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:14,694
No more bets, please.

179
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,606
Yes, we won!

180
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:53,595
$4,100.
We said we wouldn't go below $5,000.

181
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:56,003
Do you want any more coffee?

182
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,076
No, thank you.

183
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,356
Tails we quit. Heads we go for it.

184
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,214
Two out of three.

185
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:42,618
Last call for wagers.

186
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:45,248
No more bets.

187
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:47,328
OK. I am feeling lucky.

188
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,589
I say we put it on red.

189
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,595
All of it. Red.

190
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,665
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

191
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:58,702
We can do this, huh?

192
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,620
I am going to put it on.

193
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:06,332
I am putting it on red.

194
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:08,964
OK.

195
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:31,736
No, it's black.

196
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,236
What are you doing?

197
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:35,738
- It's black.
- What are you doing?

198
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:41,312
No, it's red.

199
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:44,013
Go with your instinct. Right?

200
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:47,347
- No more bets.
- Come on, man.

201
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:52,248
got to get it.

202
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,420
OK, come on red, come on red.

203
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:07,529
Too late, young lady.

204
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:47,179
Place your bets.

205
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,211
Bank side, player side.

206
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:51,646
All set? Cards, please.

207
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:57,017
Turning for the players.

208
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:59,917
Passes to the right, please.

209
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:06,228
Player draws nothing.

210
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:18,108
And set.

211
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:21,813
Player side, banker side.

212
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:26,483
- Who's that guy?
- That's John Gage.

213
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:27,819
He's a damn billionaire.

214
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:30,214
That's a rich son of a bitch right there.

215
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,984
He's down over a million dollars already.

216
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,685
You see them little gold things he's playing with?

217
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:38,126
$10,000 apiece.

218
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:41,461
Every time he lays one down, 10,000 big ones.

219
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:42,759
Look how cool he is.

220
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:46,264
He must get more pussy than
you can shake a stick at.

221
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:46,973
I am sorry.

222
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,841
I didn't mean to offend you.

223
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,000
Player wins.

224
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,633
It's about time.

225
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:55,440
- You all married?
- Yeah.

226
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,971
Stick around and gamble a little.

227
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:00,066
Excuse me! Excuse me.

228
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:04,130
Would you mind lending me your wife?

229
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:05,617
Is that your wife?

230
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,157
Excuse me?

231
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:12,930
- For luck.
- Well, you'd have to ask her.

232
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,329
- May I?
- Go for it.

233
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:19,927
I don't think it's a good idea.

234
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:20,700
We should go.

235
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,137
- Just for a moment?
- I will go.

236
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:24,823
Go ahead. It might be fun.

237
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:26,574
What have we got to lose?

238
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:29,681
- Well?
- Go and see what happens.

239
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:30,643
Yeah, go ahead.

240
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:33,105
We will be here, backing you up.

241
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,578
Thank you.

242
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:38,713
See if you can get
a little of that money from him.

243
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:42,384
Do you think she will ever come back?

244
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,996
I am just bullshitting you.

245
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:47,993
Have a seat.

246
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,431
I have been losing all day long.

247
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:53,232
Then you appeared and I won my first hand.

248
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,699
You brought me luck.

249
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,308
I'd say that's a sign.

250
00:23:57,308 --> 00:23:59,411
Wouldn't you?

251
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:03,547
Would you like a drink?

252
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:04,672
No, thank you.

253
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:06,844
Candy?

254
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:12,685
Place your bets.

255
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,588
100,000.

256
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,792
Just like that?

257
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:20,146
Just like that.

258
00:24:25,938 --> 00:24:28,998
- Not like that.
- Sorry.

259
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:35,807
All bets set? Cards, please.

260
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:40,812
Turning for the players.

261
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,352
Now, what we want...

262
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:46,483
What we need... is a nine.

263
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:54,664
We don't like that.

264
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:57,025
Player draws nothing.

265
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:58,760
Cards for the bank, please.

266
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,885
Bank's the winner with a natural eight.

267
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:01,727
Pay the bank.

268
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:08,410
I guess I am not so lucky after all.

269
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,347
- Do you like cards?
- Not especially.

270
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:16,114
Wish I'd asked you sooner. Dice?

271
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:19,482
Yeah, I guess.

272
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:26,024
- Sam.
- Mr. G?

273
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,328
One.

274
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,936
Excuse me, Mr. G.

275
00:25:41,814 --> 00:25:42,672
Maybe I should go.

276
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:44,339
This shouldn't take too long.

277
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:47,043
- What?
- This.

278
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:55,391
Now...

279
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,863
I hope you find this interesting.

280
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:02,157
Pit. Tadross.

281
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:05,828
Yes, sir. It's here now.

282
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,294
Goes for one million dollars.

283
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,635
It's a bet.

284
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:26,416
Here you are, Mr. G. One million dollars.

285
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,613
Bet it all.

286
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:17,843
Coming out.

287
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,811
Crap eleven or any seven this time.

288
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:21,042
It is a come-out roll.

289
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:22,199
How much goes, now?

290
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,113
Get them down.

291
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:25,273
Pick two.

292
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,751
Now just throw a seven.

293
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:37,858
If you want to throw an eleven, that's all right too.

294
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:45,333
Aren't you forgetting something?

295
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:07,457
Winner!

296
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:24,165
Think I ought to quit now?

297
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,371
I think I should.

298
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:29,475
Credit my account.

299
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:37,551
Sweetie, that was incredible.
Unbelievable.

300
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,850
Hi. John Gage.

301
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,825
- Hi. David Murphy.
- Hi, David.

302
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:46,158
Congratulations.
This is my wife Diana. I guess you met.

303
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:49,495
- Hi. Diana?
- Diana.

304
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:52,020
Thank you both. Very generous of you, David.

305
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:53,799
Are you staying at the hotel?

306
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,536
No. Actually we're just leaving.

307
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:57,272
Yes, we're on our way out.

308
00:28:57,272 --> 00:28:59,462
No, don't do that. We got to celebrate.

309
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,564
Let me arrange a room for you here.

310
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:04,741
- That's very nice, but...
- No, I insist.

311
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,852
Please. It's the least I can do. OK?

312
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:09,589
Really, just sign for it.

313
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,978
Anything you want.

314
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:13,819
There's some lovely shops
off the lobby.

315
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,551
Have you seen them?

316
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:19,586
Let's go.

317
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,201
How about that?

318
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:37,715
Wow.

319
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,884
D, what do you think?

320
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,050
Godfather?

321
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:51,293
You won a million dollars today.

322
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,060
- He won it.
- Honey, you won it for him.

323
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:05,705
This feels nice.

324
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:09,442
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

325
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:10,192
OK.

366
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,527
Hello. William Shackleford.

367
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,925
Hi. David Murphy.

368
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:29,362
For Mrs. Murphy. From John Gage.

369
00:30:30,802 --> 00:30:32,599
Well, thank him for us.

370
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,501
I will do that.

371
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:37,107
Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering tonight in his suite at nine.

372
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:41,144
If you can find the time in your schedule, he'd be most pleased.

373
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:45,516
- Look what you got.
- What?

374
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,212
Gift from Gage.

375
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,478
Really?

376
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:54,785
Well, open it up.

377
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:07,532
That's $5,000.

378
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:11,368
How do you know that?

379
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:14,001
I saw it in the store downstairs.

380
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:20,279
- Lucky for him you like black.
- Yeah.

381
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,366
No past, no future.

382
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,365
Just check in to a hotel and start all over again.

383
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:04,153
I just stick them under the sheets...

384
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:07,656
That's strange, am I right?

385
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:16,130
- In another life, have a good time.
- Thanks.

386
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,506
Who is that guy Shackleford?

387
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:34,278
Someone who works for me.

388
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,717
Someone I trust.

389
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:42,624
He killed someone once.

390
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:51,201
Tell me, where do you see yourself in, say, ten years?

391
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:56,502
Well, I wouldn't mind being a billionaire like yourself.

392
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,867
Nice shot.
I mean beyond money.

393
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:02,571
What would satisfy you completely, let you sleep well?

394
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:06,180
Are you saying you're not satisfied?

395
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,510
Who is?

396
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,549
I am.

397
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:15,553
She mean it?

398
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:18,026
I hope so.

399
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:22,054
Well then, you may not have won in Vegas, but you're a lucky man.

400
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:24,225
I got money, I got security, I have businesses,

401
00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:28,135
but you have something that I just don't have.

402
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:31,208
I guess there's limits to what money can buy.

403
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,439
Not many.

404
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:37,074
Well, some things aren't for sale.

405
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,074
Such as?

406
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,419
Well, you can't buy people.

407
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:45,987
That's naive, Diana.

408
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:47,485
I buy people every day.

409
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,925
In business, maybe, but not
when real emotions are involved.

410
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:53,067
What are you saying?

411
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:54,231
You can't buy love?

412
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:55,514
Isn't that a clichÈ?

413
00:34:56,768 --> 00:34:59,896
- It's absolutely true.
- Is it?

414
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,938
What do you think?

415
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:04,906
- I agree with Diana.
- You do?

416
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:09,540
Well, let's test the clichÈ.

417
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:18,054
Suppose I were to offer you one million dollars...

418
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:24,989
...for one night with your wife?

419
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,261
I'd assume you're kidding.

420
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,885
Let's pretend I am not.

421
00:35:33,911 --> 00:35:35,658
What would you say?

422
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:41,272
He'd tell you to go to hell.

423
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:45,415
I didn't hear him.

424
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:48,779
I'd tell you to go to hell.

425
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:04,198
That's a reflex answer because your view it as hypothetical.

426
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:08,396
But let's say that there were real money behind it.

427
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:11,375
I am not kidding.

428
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,699
A million dollars.

429
00:36:12,725 --> 00:36:17,063
The night would pass, but the money could last a lifetime.

430
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:20,012
Think of it.

431
00:36:20,618 --> 00:36:22,449
A million dollars.

432
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:28,355
A lifetime of security, for one night.

433
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:33,887
And don't answer right away, but consider it.

434
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,830
Seriously.

435
00:36:38,136 --> 00:36:40,502
We're positive, OK?

436
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:46,072
Then you have answered my question.

437
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:47,925
And you have proved your point.

438
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:50,375
There are limits to what money can buy.

439
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:55,179
It's late and I hate to admit it, but I have a meeting.

440
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,447
May I have one dance?

441
00:36:57,447 --> 00:37:00,387
Of course, with your permission.

442
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,686
I think you'd better get on to that meeting.

443
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:04,988
You don't want to miss out on your next billion.

444
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:09,429
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her either.

445
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,865
Goodnight.

446
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:12,892
Can't sleep?

447
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:15,783
No.

448
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:20,167
Me neither.

449
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:29,444
I just keep thinking about it.

450
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:34,511
It's so weird, isn't it?

451
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:38,452
Yeah.

452
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:47,494
David, I think you want me to do it.

453
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:54,433
What are you talking about?

454
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,665
Don't be ridiculous.

455
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,108
Maybe we should just talk about it.

456
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,806
Well, I don't want you to do it.

457
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:12,320
- But you'd let me do it.
- No.

458
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:20,959
Why? Do you want to do it?

459
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:23,584
No.

460
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:31,341
But I would. I'd do it for you.

461
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,536
For me?

462
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:48,881
I can't believe we're even talking about this.

463
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:56,163
Think about what this money could do
for us, what it could do for our future.

464
00:39:57,635 --> 00:40:00,468
You could finish your house.

465
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:03,360
You could pay your dad back.

466
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:05,761
Get rid of our debts.

467
00:40:07,445 --> 00:40:10,005
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

468
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:12,309
It's just my body.

469
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,026
It's not my mind.

470
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:16,070
It's not my heart.

471
00:40:18,723 --> 00:40:22,682
You think we could do something like that?

472
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:32,466
We both slept with other people before we were married, right?

473
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:34,002
Yeah.

474
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,497
So we just have to look at it like that.

475
00:40:42,347 --> 00:40:43,682
I slept with Bubba Aruzio!

476
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,942
If I can do that, I can sleep with anyone.

477
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:47,989
You slept with Bubba?

478
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,451
You knew.

479
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:52,112
No, I didn't know that. When?

480
00:40:53,624 --> 00:40:56,787
When you were off sleeping with that slut Olivia Daigle.

481
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,804
Olivia Deagle.

482
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,476
And she wasn't a slut.

483
00:40:59,502 --> 00:41:01,729
Excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

484
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:03,333
I do love you.

485
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,163
- She wasn't a slut.
- Yes, she was.

486
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:08,568
No, she wasn't...

487
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:10,936
...unfortunately!

488
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:17,473
Thank God we can laugh about it.

489
00:41:17,473 --> 00:41:19,515
Yeah.

490
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:22,983
That's easy to say now. After...

491
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:31,560
We just have to forget
it ever happened.

492
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:35,616
And never discuss it.

493
00:41:35,642 --> 00:41:36,916
Not even once.

494
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:43,332
Because nothing will have happened.

495
00:41:45,243 --> 00:41:48,076
Nothing that matters, anyway.

496
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:58,964
We have a brilliant script.

497
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,919
Very special.

498
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:03,390
It's a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.

499
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,858
And Billy Ray Cyrus.

500
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:06,986
Kind of "A Star is Born"...

501
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:09,429
So your first screenplay sold for half a million.

502
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:10,493
Should have been two.

503
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,468
Except our lawyer caved in on us.

504
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:13,706
That won't happen again.

505
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:16,130
We're going to get a lawyer that's tough.

506
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:20,005
Someone that will step on his grandmother for us.

507
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:24,212
Mr. Green. A David Murphy wants to speak to you urgently.

508
00:42:24,212 --> 00:42:26,009
Put him on the speaker.

509
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,462
This is an old college buddy.

510
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:28,914
It will only take a second.

511
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:29,581
<i>Jeremy?</i>

512
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,442
<i>Davey, I am in a meeting.</i>

513
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:32,250
<i>What's up?</i>

514
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,620
<i>Listen, we need you to close a deal.</i>

515
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,804
<i>What kind of deal?</i>

516
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,250
<i>A very big deal.</i>

517
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,295
Big deal. Go on.

518
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,526
<i>We're in Vegas at the Hilton.</i>

519
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:42,919
<i>We met John Gage.</i>

520
00:42:42,945 --> 00:42:44,527
<i>You know who he is?</i>

521
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:46,359
Sure I know who he is.

522
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:48,030
He's a billionaire.

523
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:50,107
And a major poon hound.

524
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:51,503
<i>He is?</i>

525
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:52,939
Go on.

526
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:55,130
<i>He offered us a million dollars.</i>

527
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,774
<i>A million dollars?</i>

528
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,747
For what? Your kidneys?

529
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:03,853
<i>For one night with Diana.</i>

530
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:09,822
What do you mean? One night? Like...

531
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:11,258
<i>Yes.</i>

532
00:43:14,432 --> 00:43:17,924
Could you excuse me for a second?

533
00:43:21,806 --> 00:43:25,037
Let me get this straight.

534
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:29,132
He offered you a million dollars for a night with your wife?

535
00:43:29,158 --> 00:43:30,273
Your wife Diana?

536
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:31,437
And you agreed?

537
00:43:31,463 --> 00:43:33,455
I don't know what to say.

538
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:35,317
How could you do that?

539
00:43:35,317 --> 00:43:37,651
How could you negotiate without me?

540
00:43:37,677 --> 00:43:40,186
Never negotiate without your lawyer!

541
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:44,556
For a woman like Diana, I could have gotten you at least two million!

542
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:45,437
Obviously!

543
00:43:45,463 --> 00:43:48,961
You don't want to get screwed and then screwed!

544
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,863
Stay, please. This is damage control.

545
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:52,413
Two seconds. Eat cookies.

546
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:54,335
No. We have heard enough.

547
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:55,179
You're hired.

548
00:43:55,205 --> 00:43:56,334
You're our man.

549
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,839
We love your style.

550
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,174
Gladys, check the gentlemen's schedules.

551
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,342
Call me next week.

552
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:03,003
- Great.
- See you then.

553
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:06,913
- Thanks for coming.
- No. Thank you.

554
00:44:06,913 --> 00:44:09,679
OK, David, before we go any further,

555
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,916
let's get the moral issue out of the way.

556
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:18,188
Leave that to us. No, I was referring to my fee. I get 5%.

557
00:44:19,897 --> 00:44:22,127
Would you elaborate on the verification clause?

558
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,463
Verification. That means you pay, even if the relationship isn't consummated.

559
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,036
You mean if I am impotent.

560
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,508
It's important for a lawyer to cover contingencies.

561
00:44:36,681 --> 00:44:37,966
I can live with that.

562
00:44:37,992 --> 00:44:39,741
The "John Garfield clause"?

563
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:42,978
That's if you die in the act.

564
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:48,485
I have no problem with that either.

565
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,911
Can I have your pen?

566
00:44:57,201 --> 00:44:59,965
- You're pretty good, you know?
- Thank you.

567
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,628
You should come work for me.

568
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:15,818
We have a deal.

569
00:45:19,857 --> 00:45:24,260
A million dollars will be deposited in your casino account in the morning.

570
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:31,968
So...

571
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:34,828
So...

572
00:45:35,573 --> 00:45:37,336
So...

573
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:41,768
You can go.

574
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:44,540
Gentlemen, I think it's time for men of good will

575
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,345
to take leave of one another.

576
00:46:14,645 --> 00:46:16,772
It's all right.

577
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,973
I don't bite.

578
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:22,810
So...

579
00:46:24,455 --> 00:46:26,889
What, should I go undress?

580
00:46:31,729 --> 00:46:34,926
Cheer up. Find a more creative way to think about this, OK?

581
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:39,526
Just look at it like an episode of "The Dating Game" that went a bit awry.

582
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:42,468
- It's going to be OK...
- Ladies and gentlemen.

583
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:46,872
Me wish to welcome you to our jamboree.

584
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:51,607
I couldn't believe it. I know we could have gotten two million.

585
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:53,114
Here's your Buddha.

586
00:46:53,114 --> 00:46:56,048
Davey, no point getting out the crying towel.

587
00:46:56,048 --> 00:46:58,651
You have got a million bucks, buddy.

588
00:46:58,677 --> 00:46:59,978
A million bucks!

589
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,645
She's an amazing woman.

590
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:05,886
She really is.

591
00:47:05,886 --> 00:47:09,932
Couldn't have gotten 500 for my girlfriend. Not that I'd do that...

592
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:11,922
But it's OK that you did.

593
00:47:11,948 --> 00:47:14,470
This is a different situation.

594
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,630
And she agreed to it, you got to remember that.

595
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,606
And it's not like it's hard duty or anything.

596
00:47:19,632 --> 00:47:21,677
Hell, he's a great-looking guy.

597
00:47:21,677 --> 00:47:24,872
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

598
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:28,313
Maybe not.

599
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:30,784
Hey, buddy!

600
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,494
Come on!

601
00:47:52,643 --> 00:47:54,133
Come on!

602
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:59,811
What have I done?

603
00:48:13,798 --> 00:48:16,323
D, it's me!

604
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:18,268
D!

605
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:20,737
D!

606
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:25,616
Where is she?

607
00:48:25,642 --> 00:48:27,497
Where's my wife?

608
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:34,137
Diana!

609
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:37,418
Please!

610
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:39,352
Where did they go?

611
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:42,459
- Up!
- Up where?

612
00:48:42,993 --> 00:48:45,359
<i>- HelicÛptero.</i>
<i>- Helicopter.</i>

613
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:03,313
D!

614
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:09,119
D!

615
00:49:11,355 --> 00:49:12,605
D! D!

616
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:19,930
D!

617
00:53:38,188 --> 00:53:39,902
They sent for me.

618
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:42,650
They said you were ready.

619
00:53:55,906 --> 00:53:57,396
Come here.

620
00:54:20,063 --> 00:54:22,031
You missed a button.

621
00:54:29,606 --> 00:54:31,767
Thank you.

622
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,143
I want to show you something.

623
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:53,066
What happened?

624
00:54:53,092 --> 00:54:55,350
Lights went off.

625
00:54:58,368 --> 00:55:00,768
I see that. Why?

626
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:06,204
Look.

627
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,244
Can you turn those off, too?

628
00:55:17,654 --> 00:55:19,315
I am working on it.

629
00:55:25,062 --> 00:55:26,586
Who made the decision?

630
00:55:30,234 --> 00:55:33,533
- We both did.
- No.

631
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:38,274
Do it for your own reasons, or don't do it.

632
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:40,892
You don't know him.

633
00:55:40,918 --> 00:55:43,276
I know he didn't stop you.

634
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:45,506
And if you were mine...

635
00:55:48,952 --> 00:55:51,580
...I wouldn't share you with anyone.

636
00:55:57,261 --> 00:56:00,230
You have no right to judge David.

637
00:56:02,866 --> 00:56:05,357
You're the one who has to buy women.

638
00:56:05,357 --> 00:56:08,369
You think I have to buy women?

639
00:56:12,509 --> 00:56:14,409
Why me, then?

640
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:18,139
I bought you because you said you couldn't be bought.

641
00:56:19,549 --> 00:56:21,881
I can't be bought.

642
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:24,351
We're just going to fuck, as I understand it.

643
00:56:26,323 --> 00:56:28,154
You might enjoy it.

644
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,491
Don't bet on it.

645
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:36,530
I think I will.

646
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:42,870
Heads we do.

647
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:45,463
Tails we call the whole thing off.

648
00:56:45,463 --> 00:56:47,329
Turn the boat around, go home.

649
00:56:47,355 --> 00:56:48,535
No hard feelings.

650
00:56:49,346 --> 00:56:51,610
What do you say?

651
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,710
It's your party.

652
00:56:56,887 --> 00:57:01,620
It's my lucky dollar, so I can't lose.

653
00:57:23,747 --> 00:57:25,044
Trust me.

654
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:29,478
Nothing's going to happen you don't choose.

655
00:59:43,887 --> 00:59:46,412
- I love you.
- I love you.

656
01:00:02,038 --> 01:00:04,131
<i>I told myself it was over,</i>

657
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:06,970
<i>like a dream that vanishes in the morning light,</i>

658
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:11,410
<i>and in time, enough time, I would forget.</i>

699
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:27,487
Yeah.

700
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:30,622
All right.

701
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:38,463
Yeah. A little fixer-upper south of Wilshire.
It's nothing.

702
01:00:38,463 --> 01:00:40,371
Yeah.

703
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:42,671
Look, I have got people here.

704
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:44,939
I will talk to you later.

705
01:00:44,939 --> 01:00:48,175
Sorry. I am here for you now.

706
01:00:48,175 --> 01:00:50,912
All right. Two acres on Alta Loma...

707
01:00:50,912 --> 01:00:54,615
- Alta Vista.
- That's right. Murphy property.

708
01:00:55,525 --> 01:00:57,652
We have been a little late on the payments.

709
01:00:57,678 --> 01:00:58,790
We want to settle up.

710
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,194
I don't think that's possible.

711
01:01:02,194 --> 01:01:03,005
What do you mean?

712
01:01:03,031 --> 01:01:05,199
The mortgage is two months in default...

713
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:09,897
...and it appears that the property is in contract to another party.

714
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:12,425
To another party? Who?

715
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:14,473
That's privileged information.

716
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:15,283
How can that be?

717
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:17,409
We called specifically for an extension.

718
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:20,141
The extension expired two days ago.

719
01:01:20,141 --> 01:01:23,343
If you don't make a payment, the bank can repossess.

720
01:01:23,343 --> 01:01:27,013
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

721
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:29,352
They don't have to give us a warning.

722
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,552
But, in fact, an attempt was made to call you on the 3rd.

723
01:01:32,552 --> 01:01:36,427
A registered letter, return receipt requested, was attempted on the 4th.

724
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:38,592
Apparently there was no one home.

725
01:01:38,618 --> 01:01:40,297
We were out of town.

726
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:45,704
Well, I am sorry, but you snooze, you lose.

727
01:01:46,977 --> 01:01:49,605
"You snooze, you lose."

728
01:01:50,313 --> 01:01:51,905
"You snooze, you lose"?

729
01:01:51,905 --> 01:01:56,144
- It's an expression.
- That's beautiful.

730
01:01:56,686 --> 01:01:59,154
That's bullshit!

731
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,814
This is bullshit, man!

732
01:02:01,814 --> 01:02:03,638
Don't deal with these people!

733
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:04,833
They sold us out.

734
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:06,682
They will sell you out, too.

735
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:54,406
want to help me in the garden?

736
01:02:56,846 --> 01:02:57,596
OK.

737
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:11,119
Our tomatoes are looking good, don't you think?

738
01:03:13,096 --> 01:03:14,757
David?

739
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:19,467
What's "Gryphonne"?

740
01:03:20,904 --> 01:03:22,895
Gryphon.

741
01:03:24,174 --> 01:03:26,301
Where did you hear that name?

742
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:30,477
You have a box of matches.

743
01:03:32,415 --> 01:03:34,412
We said we wouldn't talk about it.

744
01:03:34,438 --> 01:03:37,139
Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

745
01:03:39,122 --> 01:03:41,454
Don't you?

746
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:42,534
- No.
- D.

747
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:50,458
I thought I could forget about this, but I can't.

748
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:56,732
So I think maybe if we just talk about it, we can put it behind us.

749
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,347
"Gryphon" is a boat.

750
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:08,883
He took you to a boat?

751
01:04:08,883 --> 01:04:09,679
In Nevada?

752
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:12,146
We flew to Santa Barbara.

753
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:14,722
- What kind of boat?
- A big boat.

754
01:04:14,722 --> 01:04:16,211
And then what?

755
01:04:16,237 --> 01:04:18,683
And then nothing.

756
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,410
Where did you get the matches?

757
01:04:22,436 --> 01:04:24,095
Were you going through my bag?

758
01:04:24,095 --> 01:04:24,845
No!

759
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:30,533
Why? What's in your bag?

760
01:04:31,407 --> 01:04:33,102
I am not going to talk about this.

761
01:04:33,128 --> 01:04:34,424
I am not going to do it.

762
01:06:11,774 --> 01:06:13,207
What?

763
01:06:14,811 --> 01:06:18,907
- Who were you talking to?
- My mother.

764
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:22,313
And what did Mom have to say?

765
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:26,355
Nothing. She wasn't there.

766
01:06:26,355 --> 01:06:28,493
You said you were just talking to her.

767
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:30,687
How could you be if she wasn't there?

768
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:34,957
Well, I was trying to talk to her, but I didn't reach her.

769
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,703
She wasn't in after ten o'clock?

770
01:06:36,729 --> 01:06:37,794
No, she's not.

771
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:42,030
If you don't believe me, would you like to talk to her yourself?

772
01:06:44,707 --> 01:06:47,005
What is the matter with you?

773
01:06:53,216 --> 01:06:54,327
What is that?

774
01:06:54,353 --> 01:06:56,574
You know what it is.

775
01:06:59,923 --> 01:07:01,647
Where did you get this?

776
01:07:01,673 --> 01:07:03,222
In your wallet.

777
01:07:03,222 --> 01:07:04,758
I have never seen it.

778
01:07:04,758 --> 01:07:06,885
It was in the secret compartment.

779
01:07:06,911 --> 01:07:08,625
Have you been seeing him?

780
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:11,256
- No!
- You can't stop thinking about him.

781
01:07:11,256 --> 01:07:12,891
You won't let me.

782
01:07:14,137 --> 01:07:15,559
Why did you look in my wallet?

783
01:07:15,585 --> 01:07:16,697
I don't trust you.

784
01:07:16,697 --> 01:07:18,735
You know, I don't trust you either.

785
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:20,391
Well, then we're even.

786
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:31,616
<i>I had to do something.</i>

787
01:07:31,616 --> 01:07:34,518
<i>I wanted to make something good out of all we'd done wrong.</i>

788
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:38,559
<i>I decided to try and buy our land back.</i>

789
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,289
OK. Alta Vista.

790
01:07:41,289 --> 01:07:43,704
I just need to find out the guy's name.

791
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,561
I want to make him an offer.

792
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,621
I will get killed for this, Diana.

793
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,105
I don't want you to get in trouble.

794
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:52,833
- 543 Alta Vista.
- There it is.

795
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,944
There it is right there. Back up.

796
01:07:54,944 --> 01:07:58,343
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

797
01:08:00,216 --> 01:08:03,811
This guy's never going to sell, Diana.

798
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:06,547
I just saw this guy on TV!

799
01:08:46,929 --> 01:08:50,160
You bastard! You stole our property.

800
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,616
I'd like to introduce a friend of mine...

801
01:08:53,642 --> 01:08:55,228
I am not your friend.

802
01:08:55,228 --> 01:08:57,999
- Diana advised me on some property...
- Bullshit!

803
01:08:57,999 --> 01:08:59,718
You took it and I want it back.

804
01:08:59,744 --> 01:09:00,790
I tell you what.

805
01:09:00,816 --> 01:09:01,770
Can we have...

806
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,510
That's OK. No, everything's fine.

807
01:09:03,536 --> 01:09:05,064
Everything's under control.

808
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:09,351
Excuse me.

809
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:18,184
I am taking it off!

810
01:09:21,297 --> 01:09:22,067
Wait a minute...

811
01:09:22,093 --> 01:09:23,993
Why? Did you just want to hurt me?

812
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,367
No! I think you're wonderful.

813
01:09:25,393 --> 01:09:27,261
That was our house! How could you?

814
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:28,294
I got there first.

815
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,531
I want you to sell it back to me.

816
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:31,735
You can't afford it.

817
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:33,540
How's a million dollars?

818
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,608
The price is two.

819
01:09:34,634 --> 01:09:37,373
If I had two, the price would be four.

820
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,640
Listen.
I saw an opportunity and took it.

821
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,878
You had the money and the right
instincts, but you were too late.

822
01:09:43,878 --> 01:09:46,545
- I want you to work for me.
- Go to hell.

823
01:09:46,545 --> 01:09:48,987
- Listen, I mean it.
- Never.

824
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:50,956
Why not?

825
01:09:50,956 --> 01:09:52,270
Because I hate you.

826
01:09:52,296 --> 01:09:53,679
No, you don't.

827
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:57,491
You wish you hated me.

828
01:10:17,687 --> 01:10:19,382
Hi, D.

829
01:10:23,526 --> 01:10:25,494
You look awful.

830
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:28,269
Where have you been?

831
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:30,192
I will tell you about it.

832
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,530
I am just going to have some wine first.

833
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:37,630
Do you want some?

834
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,388
So where have you been?

835
01:11:07,904 --> 01:11:11,897
Last night I stayed up for hours,
trying to figure a way out of this mess.

836
01:11:14,944 --> 01:11:17,174
And today?

837
01:11:20,082 --> 01:11:21,845
And today I saw Gage.

838
01:11:29,892 --> 01:11:32,370
Thank you for your trust, David.

839
01:11:32,396 --> 01:11:33,944
And for listening.

840
01:11:34,564 --> 01:11:36,498
- Did you fuck him?
- No!

841
01:11:36,498 --> 01:11:37,984
But you wanted to, right?

842
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,659
I met him in broad daylight, in public.

843
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:42,210
I don't believe you.

844
01:11:42,236 --> 01:11:45,001
David, he bought our property.

845
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,961
That's why I went to see him.

846
01:11:46,987 --> 01:11:50,204
I just wanted to find some way to get it back.

847
01:11:50,204 --> 01:11:53,726
You have no reason to be jealous.

848
01:11:53,752 --> 01:11:55,113
I hate him.

849
01:11:55,113 --> 01:11:56,620
Tell me what happened on that boat.

850
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:57,481
Don't do this!

851
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,554
Tell me what happened!

852
01:11:59,554 --> 01:12:02,283
- Why?
- because I want to know.

853
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:03,877
All right, I will tell you.

854
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,826
The man was a fucking stallion.

855
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:07,606
Is that what you want me to say?

856
01:12:07,632 --> 01:12:08,829
We did it all night.

857
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:09,920
Is that the truth?

858
01:12:09,946 --> 01:12:11,798
You don't want the truth.

859
01:12:11,798 --> 01:12:14,043
You want me to lie and say he's awful.

860
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:16,701
So I will say it, and you won't believe me.

861
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:19,364
Just tell me the truth, D.

862
01:12:19,364 --> 01:12:20,725
It was sex, David.

863
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:23,094
Just sex. Not love, just sex.

864
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:24,682
Was it good sex?

865
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,375
Don't do this, David.

866
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,026
Can you just tell me that, D?

867
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,450
Why are you hesitating?

868
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,884
Just tell me. Was it good?

869
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:35,188
Yes.

870
01:12:46,102 --> 01:12:46,822
David.

871
01:12:50,406 --> 01:12:53,151
D, don't tell me it was just sex.

872
01:12:53,177 --> 01:12:56,311
You were attracted to him all along.

873
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:57,619
That's bullshit.

874
01:12:57,645 --> 01:12:59,744
David, I did it for you.

875
01:12:59,744 --> 01:13:01,709
Don't tell me you did it for me.

876
01:13:01,735 --> 01:13:03,226
You did it for yourself.

877
01:13:03,252 --> 01:13:04,842
You were dying to do it.

878
01:13:04,842 --> 01:13:07,377
It's a lie. I would never
do this for myself.

879
01:13:07,403 --> 01:13:08,479
It was all for you.

880
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:09,827
Don't lie to me!

881
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:12,210
You were attracted to him!

882
01:14:13,155 --> 01:14:15,749
I knew something like this was going to happen.

883
01:14:15,749 --> 01:14:21,158
I guess you make a deal with the devil, and eventually you pay the price.

884
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:25,131
Thanks. From the man who closed the deal with the devil,

885
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:27,827
that's very comforting.

886
01:14:30,473 --> 01:14:31,193
Green.

887
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:35,270
- Hi, Di.
- I am not here.

888
01:14:36,278 --> 01:14:37,621
Yeah, he's right here.

889
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:39,270
You want to speak to him?

890
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,634
<i>No, I don't want to talk to him.</i>

891
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,112
<i>Look, sweetie.</i>

892
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:46,653
He loves you. You love him.

893
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:48,794
You got to try and work this out.

894
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,156
It's pretty simple.

895
01:14:50,156 --> 01:14:52,471
<i>This is a deal even I can't screw up.</i>

896
01:14:52,497 --> 01:14:54,811
<i>Tell him he can keep the money.</i>

897
01:14:56,565 --> 01:14:58,931
I don't want any of it.

898
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:10,670
Davey?
She says she doesn't want the money.

899
01:15:11,747 --> 01:15:13,681
I don't want the money either.

900
01:15:23,392 --> 01:15:24,677
I will take it.

901
01:15:24,703 --> 01:15:27,615
I mean, if nobody else wants it.

902
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:52,814
- Hi.
- Hi, Diana.

903
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:10,963
<i>The next few weeks without David felt like months.</i>

904
01:16:10,963 --> 01:16:14,098
<i>I got very good at staring at walls.</i>

905
01:16:14,098 --> 01:16:18,077
Diana, Diana.

906
01:16:18,077 --> 01:16:19,704
The recession has ended.

907
01:16:19,704 --> 01:16:23,945
There's a fella out there wants to see $10 million homes.

908
01:16:23,945 --> 01:16:26,384
There is a god.

909
01:16:30,092 --> 01:16:31,457
Find someone else.

910
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:33,689
Are you nuts?

911
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:37,724
Do you know what the commission is on $10 million?

912
01:16:37,724 --> 01:16:40,028
- I can't do it.
- You have to do it.

913
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,364
You're the best one I have.

914
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:44,214
You're the only one I have.

915
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,432
The others are all on caravan.

916
01:16:52,114 --> 01:16:54,121
I am sorry, Mr. Langford.

917
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:54,844
I can't.

918
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:59,921
I would never dream of forcing you to do anything against your will.

919
01:17:00,956 --> 01:17:02,981
Except this one time.

920
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,723
Now move your ass or you're fired.

921
01:17:13,569 --> 01:17:17,300
If you think this is going to work, you underestimate me.

922
01:17:42,431 --> 01:17:45,059
You are truly beautiful.

923
01:17:46,435 --> 01:17:48,767
What do you think you're doing?

924
01:17:50,773 --> 01:17:53,037
Looking for a house.

925
01:17:57,179 --> 01:18:00,410
There's Bel Air, Benedict Canyon, Pacific Palisades.

926
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:03,712
- Where would you like to go first?
- Paris.

927
01:18:05,621 --> 01:18:08,488
1120 Bel Air Road, please.

928
01:18:17,466 --> 01:18:19,358
The ceilings are French Gothic.

929
01:18:19,384 --> 01:18:21,800
Renaissance paintings, as you can see.

930
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,928
Parquet floors throughout.

931
01:18:23,928 --> 01:18:25,870
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

932
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:29,238
This is the master bath.

933
01:18:33,082 --> 01:18:35,277
Why didn't you return my calls?

934
01:18:36,285 --> 01:18:37,843
Do you like it?

935
01:18:39,355 --> 01:18:40,617
No.

936
01:18:53,035 --> 01:18:54,935
- 30 million minimum.
- You think?

937
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:57,129
- I know.
- Let's look at it.

938
01:18:57,129 --> 01:18:58,618
It's not for sale.

939
01:18:58,644 --> 01:19:00,960
Everything's for sale.

940
01:19:31,674 --> 01:19:34,234
This is your house, isn't it?

941
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:37,738
Do you like it?

942
01:19:43,085 --> 01:19:46,486
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

943
01:19:47,356 --> 01:19:49,551
What do you think it needs?

944
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,751
Tell me. Honestly.

945
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:57,288
I think it needs a life.

946
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:03,567
I think it needs furniture and maybe a couple of dogs and flowers.

947
01:20:03,567 --> 01:20:05,697
It needs you.

948
01:20:08,944 --> 01:20:10,323
Just forget it.

949
01:20:10,349 --> 01:20:12,345
This just won't work.

950
01:20:12,345 --> 01:20:14,108
Why not?

951
01:20:15,584 --> 01:20:18,917
Because from where we have started we have got nowhere to go.

952
01:20:18,917 --> 01:20:21,045
You don't know that.

953
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:24,616
I have never started this way either.

954
01:20:27,996 --> 01:20:30,294
I need you.

955
01:20:33,769 --> 01:20:34,519
No.

956
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:37,966
You collect things.

957
01:20:40,943 --> 01:20:42,877
Don't you?

958
01:20:44,213 --> 01:20:46,147
Sometimes.

959
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,170
Yeah.

960
01:21:58,554 --> 01:22:04,117
Even if you were extremely rich and smart can you be president?

961
01:22:04,117 --> 01:22:07,198
- No.
- You couldn't be president?

962
01:22:07,224 --> 01:22:08,015
Why not?

963
01:22:09,298 --> 01:22:13,667
<i>I took a second job teaching citizenship, just to keep myself busy.</i>

964
01:22:15,304 --> 01:22:17,966
Ju, where were you born?

965
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:20,472
I was born in Seoul, Korea.

966
01:22:20,472 --> 01:22:22,958
OK, where was she born?

967
01:22:22,984 --> 01:22:26,766
She was born in Seoul, Korea.

968
01:22:27,349 --> 01:22:31,183
<i>That drug dealer, he is the president.</i>

969
01:22:31,183 --> 01:22:33,914
<i>In my country he could be both.</i>

970
01:22:34,423 --> 01:22:37,256
Where were you born, Miguel?

971
01:22:37,256 --> 01:22:38,184
Sorry.

972
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:41,123
Welcome back.

973
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:45,199
- Where were you born?
- Cuba.

974
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:49,098
So, how do we say "Cuba" in America?

975
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:51,297
Cuba.

976
01:22:52,174 --> 01:22:55,109
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

977
01:22:55,109 --> 01:22:58,475
- Isn't this the citizenship class?
- Yes.

978
01:22:58,475 --> 01:23:01,879
- Can I sit in?
- It's full.

979
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:14,190
- Cuba.
- Thank you.

980
01:23:29,912 --> 01:23:31,743
OK, um...

981
01:23:31,743 --> 01:23:33,643
I have a question for you.

982
01:23:34,283 --> 01:23:34,975
Excuse me.

983
01:23:35,001 --> 01:23:37,766
Is there something you'd like to share with us?

984
01:23:38,287 --> 01:23:41,188
I was just saying that you're an amazing woman.

985
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:48,320
And beautiful.

986
01:23:50,465 --> 01:23:52,990
And talented.

987
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,603
And I am crazy about her.

988
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:07,582
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

989
01:24:07,608 --> 01:24:09,273
I am trying like hell.

990
01:24:10,018 --> 01:24:11,049
You should go.

991
01:24:11,075 --> 01:24:12,816
You want me to go?

992
01:24:12,816 --> 01:24:13,566
No!

993
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,149
Nice people.

994
01:24:20,175 --> 01:24:22,929
They want the Dream.

995
01:24:22,929 --> 01:24:26,125
Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

996
01:24:28,837 --> 01:24:31,738
You have chalk on your face.

997
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:36,769
I have something I want to show you.

998
01:24:50,892 --> 01:24:54,419
I didn't know whether you like big ones or little ones.

999
01:24:56,865 --> 01:25:00,357
You're so beautiful. Come here.

1000
01:25:03,005 --> 01:25:06,839
I didn't have much time to do anything else.

1001
01:25:08,643 --> 01:25:11,510
But it's a start.

1002
01:25:24,793 --> 01:25:25,513
Dance?

1003
01:25:29,097 --> 01:25:31,258
I should go.

1004
01:25:36,038 --> 01:25:37,835
I remember once when I was young,

1005
01:25:37,835 --> 01:25:40,771
and I was coming back from a movie or something,

1006
01:25:40,771 --> 01:25:42,934
I was on the subway.

1007
01:25:45,147 --> 01:25:48,378
There was a girl sitting across from me.

1008
01:25:48,378 --> 01:25:54,478
She was wearing this dress that was buttoned clear up right to here.

1009
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,188
She was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

1010
01:26:03,799 --> 01:26:06,097
And I was shy then.

1011
01:26:06,097 --> 01:26:09,465
So when she would look at me,

1012
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:11,595
I would look away.

1013
01:26:13,175 --> 01:26:16,076
Then, afterwards, when I would look back,

1014
01:26:16,076 --> 01:26:18,406
she would look away.

1015
01:26:19,915 --> 01:26:24,601
Then I got to where I was going to get off, and got off.

1016
01:26:24,627 --> 01:26:26,106
The doors closed.

1017
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:33,552
And as the train was pulling away, she looked right at me

1018
01:26:33,552 --> 01:26:36,391
and gave me the most incredible smile.

1019
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:40,634
It was awful.

1020
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:43,597
I wanted to tear the doors open.

1021
01:26:43,597 --> 01:26:48,675
I went back every night, same time, for two weeks.

1022
01:26:51,746 --> 01:26:54,442
But she never showed up.

1023
01:26:56,284 --> 01:26:58,548
That was 30 years ago.

1024
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:04,521
And I don't think there's a day that goes by that I don't think about her.

1025
01:27:06,528 --> 01:27:09,656
I don't want that to happen again.

1026
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:17,732
Just one dance?

1027

I want a word with you, Gage.

1109
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:58,658
What you don't know is we got a secret, me and Diana.

1110
01:30:58,658 --> 01:31:00,192
We're invincible.

1111
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:03,135
Diana, I need to talk...

1112
01:31:03,161 --> 01:31:05,359
Tomorrow might be a better time.

1113
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,730
Tomorrow might be better, you think?

1114
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,894
Johnny-baby, I got a suggestion for you.

1115
01:31:09,894 --> 01:31:12,690
You know that emblem you got?

1116
01:31:12,716 --> 01:31:15,101
The gryphon? The eagle?

1117
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:17,559
I don't think it's a good idea.

1118
01:31:17,585 --> 01:31:19,304
I got a better idea.

1119
01:31:19,304 --> 01:31:21,823
How about the cuckoo? Because...

1120
01:31:21,849 --> 01:31:24,578
I am talking to you for a second.

1121
01:31:24,578 --> 01:31:26,085
The cuckoo is interesting.

1122
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:27,882
It doesn't have its own nest,

1123
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:31,788
so it moves into the nest of other birds and destroys their eggs.

1124
01:31:31,788 --> 01:31:33,450
David, stop.

1125
01:31:36,798 --> 01:31:38,959
You don't love me anymore?

1126
01:31:44,172 --> 01:31:47,266
Have I ever told you I love you?

1127
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,004
Have a nice dinner.

1128
01:31:55,817 --> 01:31:57,842
- Help him.
- Here.

1129
01:31:59,354 --> 01:32:00,981
Go inside.

1130
01:32:00,981 --> 01:32:03,920
You got him?

1131
01:32:05,927 --> 01:32:06,427
D.

1132
01:34:34,509 --> 01:34:38,001
You have done a lot since USC.

1133
01:34:38,001 --> 01:34:42,173
First in your class. AIA award.

1134
01:34:42,173 --> 01:34:45,775
- Prix de Rome.
- Yeah.

1135
01:34:47,221 --> 01:34:50,054
Why would you want this job?

1136
01:34:50,054 --> 01:34:53,251
Well, I want to work.

1137
01:34:56,898 --> 01:34:58,695
Overqualified.

1138
01:34:59,267 --> 01:35:01,758
Fine. Exploit me.

1139
01:35:37,805 --> 01:35:40,501
Great architecture only comes from your passion,

1140
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:42,906
and even that won't assure you a job.

1141
01:35:42,906 --> 01:35:45,604
Louis Kahn.

1142
01:35:45,604 --> 01:35:47,787
Died in a men's room in Penn Station.

1143
01:35:47,813 --> 01:35:49,911
For days, no one claimed the body.

1144
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,848
Look at that.
 Is that beautiful?

1145
01:35:51,848 --> 01:35:54,181
The money men did not weep,

1146
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:57,052
because the great ones are impossible to deal with.

1147
01:35:57,052 --> 01:36:02,288
They're a pain in the ass, because they
know that if they do their jobs properly,

1148
01:36:02,288 --> 01:36:04,796
if they just this once get it right,

1149
01:36:04,796 --> 01:36:09,460
they can actually lift the human spirit, take it to a higher place.

1150
01:36:14,876 --> 01:36:17,436
- What is this?
- A brick.

1151
01:36:18,946 --> 01:36:21,278
Good. What else?

1152
01:36:21,278 --> 01:36:23,350
A weapon.

1153
01:36:26,587 --> 01:36:30,956
Louis Kahn said, "Even a brick wants to be something."

1154
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:41,825
A brick wants to be something.

1155
01:36:44,072 --> 01:36:46,040
It aspires.

1156
01:36:52,313 --> 01:36:57,649
Even a common, ordinary brick wants to be something more than it is.

1157
01:37:02,857 --> 01:37:06,691
Wants to be something better than it is.

1158
01:37:14,535 --> 01:37:16,662
That is what we must be.

1159
01:37:20,508 --> 01:37:22,840
See you on Friday.

1160
01:37:33,888 --> 01:37:35,510
A brick wants to be something?

1161
01:37:35,536 --> 01:37:37,619
I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

1162
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:39,056
What are you doing here?

1163
01:37:39,082 --> 01:37:40,218
I missed you.

1164
01:37:40,828 --> 01:37:43,991
- I missed you, too.
- Thanks.

1165
01:37:48,903 --> 01:37:51,428
- How you doing?
- I am good.

1166
01:37:51,428 --> 01:37:53,597
I am getting it together.

1167
01:37:59,046 --> 01:38:01,037
She wants a divorce.

1168
01:38:04,018 --> 01:38:06,282
She wants her freedom.

1169
01:38:07,822 --> 01:38:11,519
If you don't contest it, you get everything.

1170
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:15,095
The land, the money. Everything.

1171
01:38:16,097 --> 01:38:17,962
Where is she?

1172
01:38:26,674 --> 01:38:27,507
Hi, everybody.

1173
01:38:27,533 --> 01:38:28,757
I am Billy Connolly.

1174
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:30,007
Goodbye, everybody.

1175
01:38:30,007 --> 01:38:33,910
You may wonder what you're doing here, sitting in the blazing sun,

1176
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:37,677
as the smell of the zoo wafts past your nostrils.

1177
01:38:37,677 --> 01:38:41,550
The reason you are here is because you are loaded.

1178
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:44,283
May I say how brilliant it is to see so many people

1179
01:38:44,283 --> 01:38:47,622
with an interest in the preservation of endangered species.

1180
01:38:47,622 --> 01:38:51,129
Every year, we have this unique way of making money for the cause.

1181
01:38:51,129 --> 01:38:52,406
We auction animals.

1182
01:38:52,432 --> 01:38:54,826
We bid as high as we possibly can,

1183
01:38:54,826 --> 01:38:57,529
and the money goes to sponsor these lovely beasts.

1184
01:38:57,529 --> 01:38:59,428
Let's start the show with a bang.

1185
01:38:59,454 --> 01:39:02,075
We have got a superstar as our first animal.

1186
01:39:02,075 --> 01:39:05,509
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

1187
01:39:05,509 --> 01:39:09,412
The animal itself is far too big and angry to bring along.

1188
01:39:09,412 --> 01:39:10,632
Look at this guy.

1189
01:39:10,658 --> 01:39:13,145
Thousands and thousands of pounds

1190
01:39:13,145 --> 01:39:16,222
of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

1191
01:39:16,222 --> 01:39:19,292
Weighs slightly less than the average school bus.

1192
01:39:19,292 --> 01:39:22,089
And look at that magnificent beastie.

1193
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:27,258
To put him in a better light, to relieve you of some serious money...

1194
01:39:27,258 --> 01:39:29,596
Thank you very much.

1195
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:32,137
...we have a kissy-kissy picture.

1196
01:39:33,274 --> 01:39:35,401
Isn't that nice?

1197
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:43,049
Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't dream of starting the bid below $10,000.

1198
01:39:43,049 --> 01:39:45,516
- Now, I know it's a lot of money...
- 30.

1199
01:39:45,516 --> 01:39:49,453
$30,000, ladies and gentlemen!

1200
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:55,254
Call me a sentimental old fool, do I hear 35?

1201
01:39:55,254 --> 01:39:58,263
- 35.
- $35,000!

1202
01:39:58,263 --> 01:40:00,924
- 40.
- $40,000!

1203
01:40:00,924 --> 01:40:01,764
45,000.

1204
01:40:03,437 --> 01:40:06,804
- 50.
- $50,000.

1205
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:09,325
I can't believe it.

1206
01:40:09,351 --> 01:40:12,073
That's extraordinary.
50,000 once,

1207
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:15,478
50,000 twice, ladies and gentlemen...

1208
01:40:15,478 --> 01:40:18,312
One million dollars.

1209
01:40:24,292 --> 01:40:25,691
I am sorry?

1210
01:40:25,691 --> 01:40:28,090
One million dollars.

1211
01:40:30,598 --> 01:40:33,328
Did you say one million dollars, sir?

1212
01:40:33,328 --> 01:40:35,059
Yeah.

1213
01:40:35,059 --> 01:40:38,763
Ladies and gentlemen, one million dollars.

1214
01:40:40,174 --> 01:40:43,905
Would anybody care to top that, ladies and gentlemen?

1215
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:45,307
I didn't think so.

1216
01:40:45,307 --> 01:40:48,813
In that case, sir, I believe you're the proud owner of a hippo.

1217
01:40:48,813 --> 01:40:50,542
Congratulations.

1218
01:41:04,532 --> 01:41:07,160
Hello, Diana.

1219
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,098
The next animal to take the stand is an ostrich...

1220
01:41:09,098 --> 01:41:11,363
I really wanted you to have that money.

1221
01:41:11,363 --> 01:41:13,973
I really wanted you to have that hippo.

1222
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:21,210
Maybe you two would like a moment alone.

1223
01:41:34,895 --> 01:41:36,658
So...

1224
01:41:39,633 --> 01:41:41,396
- How are you...
- I hear you're teaching...

1225
01:41:41,396 --> 01:41:44,333
- Sorry.
- Go ahead.

1226
01:41:44,333 --> 01:41:46,838
Yeah. I am teaching.

1227
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:54,045
You know, it doesn't pay much, but at least I get to talk about architecture.

1228
01:41:54,045 --> 01:41:57,582
You know how I love to talk about architecture.

1229
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,444
Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.

1230
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:02,756
It's just a shower.

1231
01:42:02,756 --> 01:42:06,189
A cheque book makes an ideal umbrella.

1232
01:42:06,189 --> 01:42:07,414
Do we have a dolphin?

1233
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,455
Have we a dolphin and an octopus?

1234
01:42:09,455 --> 01:42:11,656
How about tropical fish?

1235
01:42:11,656 --> 01:42:14,734
I know. You're running home for more cash.

1236
01:42:14,734 --> 01:42:16,750
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.

1237
01:42:16,776 --> 01:42:18,430
You can find the money.

1238
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:21,040
To hell. I am gone.

1239
01:42:30,351 --> 01:42:32,649
I have to talk to you about what happened.

1240
01:42:32,649 --> 01:42:35,415
- Don't.
- No. I have to.

1241
01:42:35,415 --> 01:42:38,354
Just hear me out.

1242
01:42:40,594 --> 01:42:43,825
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

1243
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:48,162
was thinking that I could forget what we did.

1244
01:42:49,503 --> 01:42:52,631
I thought we were invincible.

1245
01:42:53,741 --> 01:42:59,680
Now I know that the things that people
in love do to each other, they remember.

1246
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,147
And if they stay together, it's not because they forget,

1247
01:43:03,147 --> 01:43:05,218
it's because they forgive.

1248
01:43:12,193 --> 01:43:14,184
I was just...

1249
01:43:17,131 --> 01:43:20,532
I was just so afraid that you wanted him.

1250
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:24,732
No, actually, I was afraid you were right to want him.

1251
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:33,446
I thought he was the better man.

1252
01:43:38,519 --> 01:43:40,982
And I know now he's not.

1253
01:43:41,008 --> 01:43:43,777
He's just got more money.

1254
01:45:16,383 --> 01:45:18,248
I think we should talk.

1255
01:45:19,153 --> 01:45:21,144
I am very happy.

1256
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:26,390
Shackleford, have you ever seen me like this?

1257
01:45:27,728 --> 01:45:30,060
Can't say that I have.

1258
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:31,843
Diana's the reason.

1259
01:45:31,869 --> 01:45:34,190
Enough for any man.

1260
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:38,396
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

1261
01:45:39,607 --> 01:45:41,404
You are the best of them.

1262
01:45:42,910 --> 01:45:44,969
"The best of them"?

1263
01:45:44,969 --> 01:45:47,637
You said I am the best of them?

1264
01:45:47,637 --> 01:45:49,715
You are.

1265
01:45:52,353 --> 01:45:54,082
I don't understand.

1266
01:45:55,723 --> 01:45:58,715
Shackleford, could you explain it to her?

1267
01:45:58,715 --> 01:46:00,326
What?

1268
01:46:01,695 --> 01:46:04,493
I could do that, sir.

1269
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:08,193
But I feel Mrs. Murphy would rather hear it from you.

1270
01:46:08,193 --> 01:46:11,099
OK. All right.

1271
01:46:11,099 --> 01:46:15,004
She's the best of the million-dollar club. Obviously.

1272
01:46:18,445 --> 01:46:20,030
"Million-dollar club"?

1273
01:46:20,056 --> 01:46:21,928
Now you have got it.

1274
01:46:23,817 --> 01:46:25,409
You told me you'd never done that before.

1275
01:46:25,409 --> 01:46:28,112
How many members would you say there are?

1276
01:46:28,989 --> 01:46:31,048
- Members?
- Yeah.

1277
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:35,153
- Worldwide?
- Yeah.

1278
01:46:36,997 --> 01:46:38,555
I think a couple of dozen.

1279
01:46:40,067 --> 01:46:42,661
Remember the one that wouldn't stop hiccuping?

1280
01:46:42,661 --> 01:46:45,795
- What?
- The waitress from Oklahoma.

1281
01:46:45,795 --> 01:46:49,431
Every time you came near her, she would convulse in hiccups.

1282
01:46:51,512 --> 01:46:53,866
Yeah. I had forgotten.

1283
01:46:53,892 --> 01:46:55,496
Quite a night.

1284
01:46:57,551 --> 01:47:03,046
The best thing of it is that you know if you're sexually compatible

1285
01:47:03,046 --> 01:47:05,454
right from the start.

1286
01:47:16,003 --> 01:47:18,563
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

1287
01:47:48,168 --> 01:47:50,136
Thank you, John.

1288
01:47:54,174 --> 01:47:55,436
Goodbye.

1289
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:58,737
Goodbye.

1290
01:48:05,252 --> 01:48:07,015
Here.

1291
01:48:10,924 --> 01:48:12,391
For luck.

1292
01:48:21,068 --> 01:48:23,059
- Take care of him.
- Sure.

1293
01:48:32,045 --> 01:48:34,411
What was all that about?

1294
01:48:36,283 --> 01:48:38,717
I wanted to end it.

1295
01:48:42,623 --> 01:48:46,184
She never would have looked at me the way she did at him.

1296
01:49:37,311 --> 01:49:41,372
<i>Seven years ago, David proposed to me at Paradise Cove.</i>

1297
01:49:42,716 --> 01:49:47,517
<i>I wanted to go there to remember and start over.</i>

1298
01:50:53,654 --> 01:50:56,817
Have I ever told you I love you?

1299
01:51:06,266 --> 01:51:07,016
No.

1300
01:51:12,105 --> 01:51:14,130
I do.

1301
01:51:19,379 --> 01:51:21,040
Still?

1302
01:51:25,185 --> 01:51:27,050
Always.

1303
01:52:15,903 --> 01:52:24,244
