1
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:37,051
What if this was your house? Power's out. Lights are dead.

2
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:39,323
Your little ones in their bunk bed down the hall, crying out...

3
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:41,730
Mommy! Daddy! Come quick! I'm scared!

4
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,961
- You need to get there, and fast. - Coming, honey! Daddy's coming!

5
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,504
You'll need a weapon. But first, you'll need a flashlight.

6
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,534
But you're in the dark! What are you gonna do?

7
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:50,575
How are you gonna find it? I'll tell you how.

8
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:52,371
The Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight!

9
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:56,079
That's right, folks! I'm Larry Daley of Daley Devices,

10
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,376
and we're gonna spend the next paid-programing block

11
00:03:58,484 --> 00:03:59,746
rocking your world.

12
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:01,803
And I brought along a friend to do it.

13
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:03,754
George Foreman, ladies and gentlemen!

14
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,648
Fantastic, Larry, fantastic! Isn't he fantastic, America?

15
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:17,063
But, seriously, isn't it true that just two years ago,

16
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,763
you were working as a night guard at some dusty museum?

17
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:22,602
That is true, two-time world heavyweight champ George Foreman.

18
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,902
I was just a regular Joe with a flashlight and a dream.

19
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,004
You mean a regular Larry.

20
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,689
But what's no joke is you're CEO of Daley Devices,

21
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,527
creator of such indispensable items as the Super Big Dog Bone!

22
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:50,658
- You like that one? - The Unlosable Key Ring!

23
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:52,363
Oh, yeah, that little chestnut!

24
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:56,499
And now your latest breakthrough... Say it with me, America!

25
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:59,339
The Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight!

26
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,815
Whatever the household crisis, this is Daley Devices. Can I help you?

27
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:07,351
Tina, give this back to Stewart. I don't trust his math, okay?

28
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,011
- That guy called again. - Again?

29
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:13,081
Lar! Huge news! We got the Wal-Mart meeting.

30
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:15,787
- No! When? - Yeah. Three days.

31
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:17,954
Okay, all right. We got a lot of work to do.

32
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:21,362
Well, okay, did you just hear me say "Wal" and "Mart" together?

33
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:22,932
Yeah! I know, it's huge.

34
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:25,036
So just take a second to be happy about it.

35
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:26,469
All right.

36
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:28,270
You're totally making fun of me.

37
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:30,535
No, let's hold off on the victory parade till we close, okay?

38
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:32,310
You got it.

39
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,145
- And when does he want to meet? - They want Friday morning, 10:00 a.m.

40
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,976
Okay, then, you know what? Cancel that pitch

41
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:39,244
for the electric saw thing with the propeller, all right?

42
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:40,649
- I just want to focus on this. - Okay.

43
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:42,448
- Just this. - My daughter's birthday, canceled!

44
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:57,897
You can go home. I'm gonna be pretty late, okay.

45
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,562
Okay, boss.

46
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:17,149
Hello! Excuse me! Unauthorized personnel!

47
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,951
If it isn't our very own Mr. Success Story.

48
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,995
Come for one of your nostalgia tours? I haven't seen you for a few months.

49
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:28,059
Yeah, I've been busy. What's going on here?

50
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:31,232
Progress, so they tell me.

51
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:37,676
The future. Behold, Natural History, version 2.0.

52
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:47,382
Welcome to The Museum of Natural History, where history comes to life!

53
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,283
Step up, ask your question.

54
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:51,788
Then let the next little boy or girl have their turn.

55
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:56,827
Okay, where were you born?

56
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,254
Right here in New York City, on Twentieth Street.

57
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:02,834
October 27th, the year of our Lord 1858.

58
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:08,967
Blah, blah, blah. History, history. Learning, learning.

59
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:11,265
Changing America, one child at a time.

60
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:15,610
That's great. So you're adding some new interactive exhibits?

61
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,576
No, Mr. Daley, not adding. Replacing the old exhibits.

62
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,246
- Where are they going? - Away.

63
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:25,119
We're getting rid of all this junk. The dioramas, the waxworks,

64
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,921
even some of the shabbier animals, like this scrawny little monkey.

65
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:31,793
You should be careful. He's a capuchin.

66
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:33,754
It's a monkey.

67
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,767
He's a rare breed. He's a capuchin. He's not just a monkey.

68
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:40,071
"Monkey", then. I said "monkey". Why be specific?

69
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,300
When you're throwing away a monkey, you don't need the Latin name.

70
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:43,941
Are you throwing him away or are you moving him?

71
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:48,236
What are you, the Primate Garbage Police? Let it go, baby.

72
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:50,639
- Whose idea was this? - Me, of course.

73
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:52,580
I'm in charge. Me and the board.

74
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:54,047
Mainly the board.

75
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,349
Anyway, why do you care?

76
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,354
No, it's just that people love this stuff.

77
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:02,488
People, Mr. Daley, love "What's next?"

78
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:04,954
You should know that. You left.

79
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,055
My situation changed. My business took off...

80
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:09,794
Yeah, you became a success. So would I, if I was a night guard.

81
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:12,103
So where are these guys going?

82
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:15,672
Deep storage. Federal Archives.

83
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:18,773
- Where's that? - Washington, D.C.

84
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:20,876
The Smithsonian.

85
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:22,612
There's got to be something that we can do.

86
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:28,551
It's done! They leave tomorrow morning. It's over.

87
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:09,286
Hey, buddy, how you doing? How you doing with all this?

88
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:11,993
You want what's in here?

89
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:15,966
You think I got something for you? You think I got a little rope?

90
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,831
Think you're stronger than me, huh?

91
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:20,494
Is that all you got, huh?

92
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,155
Lawrence! Good to see you, lad!

93
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:42,693
Yeah, you too, Teddy.

94
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:44,826
The Guardian of Brooklyn has returned!

95
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:48,132
Hey, Ahk. Look, McPhee told me what's going on around here.

96
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,599
- I had no idea. - Indeed.

97
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:52,568
A lot has transpired, Lawrence, since your last visit.

98
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:53,468
One would say that...

99
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,905
- Just... - Cricket.

100
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,710
Hey, Bocephus! Little help over here!

101
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:05,649
Hey.

102
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:09,414
Hey, fellas. How you doing?

103
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:12,022
Well, lookee here.

104
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,581
If it ain't Mr. Big-in-the-Britches himself,

105
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,060
come back just in time to see us off!

106
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,563
Yeah, Jed, I heard. Look, I don't even know how this happened.

107
00:10:20,732 --> 00:10:24,259
Yeah. Yeah, real mystery how this happened.

108
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:27,805
Maybe the answer's on that magic buzzing box there in your hand!

109
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,141
You weren't here, Gigantor! That's how it happened!

110
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,540
Ain't no mystery!

111
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,570
The fact is, Larry, there's no one else here to speak on our behalf

112
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,875
during business hours.

113
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:39,247
None, none, dum-dum.

114
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,884
Hey, guys! It's okay!

115
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,356
I'll call the board in the morning, all right? I got some pull now.

116
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:48,359
I'll handle this. We're gonna be okay here.

117
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:50,793
"We"? Did you hear that? You hear Daydream Johnny?

118
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:54,754
There ain't been a "we" ever since you put us on the "pay no mind" list.

119
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,131
And that's a cold place to be, boy.

120
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,430
Larry, what's done is done.

121
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:04,241
Even the glory of Rome had to come to an end.

122
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:08,574
Would you please not look dramatically off into the middle distance

123
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,239
when you say that? It makes me feel worse.

124
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,411
I don't know what you're talking about.

125
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:15,609
Where are you looking? Where are you looking? I'm over here.

126
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:20,152
Just a bit of wall.

127
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:21,917
Look, guys, maybe it won't be so bad.

128
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,023
Yes, you make a good point.

129
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:27,361
But this is the Smithsonian we're talking about here.

130
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,925
Dexter, you don't know that.

131
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:34,670
You're missing the point, Gigantor! They're shipping us out!

132
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:37,100
Larry, I know you're trying to make us feel better.

133
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:40,070
I can see that you're genuinely slightly bothered,

134
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,240
but it's never going to be the same.

135
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:44,848
All of us here, together, in this place.

136
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,418
It ain't never gonna be home, boy.

137
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:51,603
Jedediah, please! Lawrence,

138
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:53,953
these are emotional times for all of us.

139
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:56,854
But it is our last night as a family,

140
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,761
and I don't want to see it squandered in self-pity.

141
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:05,560
So who will join me for one final stroll through these hallowed halls?

142
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:10,206
- Do you want to go for a walk? - No.

143
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,769
I'm just gonna squander it in self-pity.

144
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,940
My dear, shall we?

145
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,301
Safe journey, my love.

146
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:52,210
Hey, Dexter, want some help there?

147
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:59,222
Hey, come on, man. No hard feelings, all right?

148
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,158
It's gonna be fine.

149
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:05,493
It's almost dawn, Lawrence.

150
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:10,223
Yeah. So, where's your crate, Teddy?

151
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,166
I won't be making this journey, Lawrence.

152
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:15,900
It seems myself, Rexy, and a few of the signature exhibits

153
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,567
will be staying here for now.

154
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,877
Without the tablet?

155
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:24,575
In truth, Lawrence,

156
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:31,688
Ahkmenrah's tablet will be remaining here with him.

157
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:34,450
What?

158
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,255
They're going without the tablet, my friend.

159
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:39,762
I'm afraid this night is their last.

160
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,628
You didn't tell them.

161
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:47,865
Sometimes it's more noble to tell a small lie than deliver a painful truth.

162
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:06,279
- Are you gonna be okay? - I shall do my best.

163
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,219
And who knows?

164
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:14,162
Sometimes the greatest change brings about even greater opportunity.

165
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:15,759
Look at you, Lawrence.

166
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:19,565
You left this place and created quite a life for yourself.

167
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,998
Yeah, I guess so.

168
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:26,604
I should hope you'd do more than guess, my friend.

169
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:30,170
You're a captain of industry. The world at your fingertips.

170
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,840
It seems to me you have everything you wanted.

171
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,075
Yeah, no, I know.

172
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:37,678
No, you don't. If I may, lad,

173
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,781
allow me to offer you one piece of advice.

174
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,327
The key to happiness, to true happiness, is...

175
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:49,327
Hang on one sec. I just gotta...

176
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:52,598
I got this Japanese deal.

177
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,005
No, okay, I'm turning this off. I'm sorry.

178
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,166
The key to happiness?

179
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:12,013
I'll see you, Teddy.

180
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:41,716
So they're gone? There's nothing you can do?

181
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,050
I wish there was, man. I'm telling you, I tried everything.

182
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:46,373
I talked to McPhee, I called the board,

183
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:48,592
but they shipped them out this morning.

184
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:50,217
This is a lot of food, Dad.

185
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:52,922
Yeah. Ed from work's gonna come by. I thought I told you.

186
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:55,192
We just have to go over a couple of little work things.

187
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,600
- So you're working tonight. - I used to work every night, remember?

188
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:01,331
That was when you had the coolest job in the world.

189
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:04,940
Yeah, well, "cool" doesn't pay for your Guitar God VI or whatever.

190
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:08,346
- Hello? - Gigantor! It's me, Jedediah!

191
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,904
- Hold! Hold! - Jed?

192
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:12,381
Never surrender!

193
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,782
Jed, what are you... How did you dial the phone?

194
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,354
Long story! That brazen little monkey stole the tablet,

195
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:19,549
and now we're in a world of hurt, boy!

196
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,785
- What's going on? - Kahmunrah!

197
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:24,759
- Kahmunrah? - Ahkmenrah's big brother! He's here!

198
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:26,922
- And trust me, not a friendly! - Never!

199
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:28,727
I repeat, not a friendly!

200
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,768
- Is that Attila, Jed? - I don't know how much longer

201
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:32,268
- we can fight them off! No! - Jed? Are you okay?

202
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,769
- Let go of me! Help! - Hey, Jed.

203
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:35,806
- Let go! No, you let go of me! Help! - Jed?

204
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:39,600
What was that about?

205
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,208
I don't know.

206
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,583
Here, come on. Gonna drop you off at your mom's.

207
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:52,316
- What's going on, Dad? - I'm gonna go find out.

208
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:57,124
Okay, buddy, McPhee said the Federal Archives are in the Smithsonian.

209
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,661
Where exactly am I going?

210
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:02,961
That's the thing, Dad. The Smithsonian is actually 19 different museums.

211
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,763
They're laid out around the National Mall,

212
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:07,464
from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial.

213
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,666
They got everything there. There's actually some really cool stuff.

214
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:13,972
Nicky, please focus. Which museum are the Archives in?

215
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,359
Not in, under.

216
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,640
It looks like it runs underneath the entire Smithsonian.

217
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:19,950
So if Ahkmenrah's tablet is down there...

218
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:22,509
The biggest museum in the world is coming alive.

219
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:24,253
What is exactly is your plan here, Dad?

220
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:26,654
- Don't worry about it. - You have no plan, do you?

221
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:29,960
Now, Nicholas, I have a very good, highly thought-out plan.

222
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:32,425
- You have no plan. - Yes, I have no plan.

223
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:33,862
I'll call you when I'm in.

224
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,504
Here you go. Thanks.

225
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,821
Welcome to the biggest museum in the world.

226
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:05,863
I know, right? It's a trip.

227
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:09,058
How about these planes dangling from the ceilings, huh? Pretty weird.

228
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,863
Hi, excuse me. Could you tell me how to get to the Federal Archives?

229
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,134
Of course. Just be a historical document worthy of storing for all eternity.

230
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,538
I'm kidding. He's not a document.

231
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:23,912
I'm sorry, sir, the Archives are underground, and they're a secure area.

232
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:27,679
Really? Like, totally secure? Okay, thank you.

233
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:14,394
Ladies and gentlemen, the museum will be closing in one hour.

234
00:19:57,475 --> 00:19:58,806
Kahmunrah.

235
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,716
Hey! What are you doing?

236
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:13,253
- No touching. - No, I wasn't gonna touch it.

237
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:15,315
You're moving in with some I.T.T., bro.

238
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,553
- I.T. T? - That's "Intent to Touch", homey.

239
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:19,727
No, I wasn't. You're not allowed to go over the...

240
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:22,163
- What, are you gonna kiss it? - All right, sorry.

241
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:24,462
Put your hand on it and touch it. 'Cause I stand there

242
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:27,231
and I wait all day for a little girl like you to come in

243
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:30,433
and put her precious nail-polished nails all over the exhibits.

244
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:33,306
Sorry. Last time I checked, I thought we lived in a free country, so...

245
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:34,469
- No, we don't. - No?

246
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:36,945
It's the United States of Don't Touch That Thing Right in Front of You.

247
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:38,642
I just want to... I'm allowed to look at it here, okay?

248
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,149
See what happens when you touch it!

249
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:42,515
So you're threatening me? You're threatening me, Brandon?

250
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,520
- It's "Brundon." - Excuse me?

251
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,089
- "Brundon"! - "Brundon"?

252
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:47,857
- "Brundon." - "Brundon."

253
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,621
What, did they run out of U's on your nameplate maker?

254
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:52,026
I don't know, did they run out of jokes

255
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,961
at the interesting-joke store that you shop at?

256
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:56,262
Sorry, it looks like "Brandon", but...

257
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:58,325
I'm not here to be your speech therapist. It's "Brundon"!

258
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:00,028
- "Brundon." Okay... - You never heard of the name before?

259
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:01,435
"Brundon"? No.

260
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:04,805
Look up most popular baby names in 1984. "Brundon."

261
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:07,504
Okay. Are you threatening me, Brundon?

262
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:09,943
I don't know, Princess Jasmine. Am I?

263
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:12,479
- Oh, wow. Lunabeam nine-volt. - Yeah.

264
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,847
Wonderful piece of hardware, huh?

265
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:15,647
- That's their title, Lunabeam Nine. - Great.

266
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,188
I prefer the Maglite LED myself, but that's just me.

267
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,189
- Do me a huge favor. - What?

268
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,284
Shove your hands into your pockets, put your attitude way down,

269
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:26,159
and, also, be nice to people.

270
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:28,795
Great. But could I just ask you one thing?

271
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,629
- Yeah. - Okay, so just to be clear,

272
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:33,899
- so, I can't do this, right? - Okay, that's actually crazy.

273
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:35,700
Did you just make a decision to possibly end your life

274
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:36,797
earlier than you were expecting?

275
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:38,171
I'm gonna hit you with the flashlight.

276
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:40,233
- Now you are threatening me. Okay. - Do not touch it!

277
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:41,903
- Don't touch me. - Do not touch it!

278
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:43,310
- Do not touch it! - Don't touch me!

279
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:44,678
I'll touch you with my flashlight all day.

280
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:46,307
No, your flashlight is meant to illuminate.

281
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:48,875
I will literally rent a camper,

282
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:51,478
and we will drive across America with my flashlight on your chest.

283
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:53,490
- Don't do that. - Don't do what?

284
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:55,224
Want to see what happens when I do it one more time?

285
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:57,260
- Let's see what happens. - Watch you do nothing.

286
00:21:57,362 --> 00:21:59,159
Let's watch you do nothing when I do this.

287
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,326
Seriously, Brandon...

288
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,595
- Brundon. - Brundon,

289
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:06,431
you do not know who you're dealing with.

290
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:09,028
You think you know what it means to be a guard, huh?

291
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:11,234
Trust me, you don't know the meaning of the word.

292
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,374
I have seen things that you could not imagine.

293
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:17,243
- Like what kind of stuff? - I'm not gonna tell you.

294
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:19,077
- But you're gonna drop the flashlight... - The way you said it,

295
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:21,048
it sounded like you were gonna say something cool.

296
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,110
Yeah, well, you don't get to hear it.

297
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:24,711
Drop the flashlight.

298
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:34,864
We cool?

299
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,465
That's actually pretty cool, what you just did.

300
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,899
Thank you.

301
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,767
No hard feelings?

302
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:43,568
- All right? Sorry. - Okay.

303
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:45,632
- I'm sorry. - No, It's my fault. I shouldn't have...

304
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:47,768
No. It takes two opposing forces to cause friction, and...

305
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:49,471
And you're just doing your job, all right.

306
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,414
- Take it easy, man. - Yeah!

307
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,316
That guy's great.

308
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:42,078
Okay, buddy, I'm in.

309
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:43,159
Great. Where are you?

310
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:46,063
The northeast corridor of the Castle, just off the Commons.

311
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:48,332
- I need you to talk me to the Archives. - Okay.

312
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,131
At the end of the hall, turn right,

313
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,142
and there should be a stairwell coming up on your left.

314
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,210
- Got it. - Now, it's kind of a maze down there.

315
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:58,009
Those underground tunnels connect a bunch of different buildings.

316
00:23:58,116 --> 00:23:59,674
- It could get complicated. - We'd better hurry,

317
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:01,684
we only got 28 minutes till sundown.

318
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:04,880
When you get down to B level, you want to take another left...

319
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:08,117
- Nick? Hello? Nick? - Dad! Can you hear...

320
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,625
Nick, you're... Nick!

321
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:40,081
- ID, Brundon. - Hey.

322
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:43,193
- Later, dude. - All right. Yeah.

323
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:55,504
All right. Where are you guys?

324
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:29,629
Oh, my God.

325
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:05,734
You little troublemaker. I'm gonna deal with you later.

326
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:47,306
No. No! No, no, no!

327
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:07,625
No, English. English, perhaps.

328
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,499
I'm sorry, who are you?

329
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:16,467
I am Kahmunrah, the great king of the great kings,

330
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:19,941
and from the darkest depths of ancient history,

331
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:23,913
I have come back to life!

332
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:30,878
Perhaps you did not hear what I just said.

333
00:28:30,955 --> 00:28:36,450
I am a centuries-old Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dead,

334
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:40,964
but now I have come back to life!

335
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:44,668
Yeah, no. I heard that. I got that. Welcome back.

336
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:53,166
- Who are you? - Larry Daley. Daley Devices?

337
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:57,373
It's up in New York. It's funny, I know your brother, Ahkmenrah.

338
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:58,778
- Do you? - Yeah.

339
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:02,546
He knows baby brother. The favorite son.

340
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:05,144
- Yeah, good kid. - Isn't he just?

341
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:08,321
You know, Mother and Father always gave him the best of everything,

342
00:29:08,392 --> 00:29:11,623
and I do mean everything. They even gave him the throne.

343
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:14,495
The throne which was rightfully mine!

344
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:17,960
- He never mentioned that. - I'll just bet he didn't.

345
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:24,406
Well, now begins the era of Kahmunrah, because I have come back to...

346
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:26,373
Never mind, just hand me the tablet.

347
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:28,672
- Don't give it to him, Gigantor! - Keep him away!

348
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,237
Silence! Silence in there, please!

349
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,485
- Don't make me come in there! - No! I won't be muzzled!

350
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:38,779
Look, that tablet is more powerful

351
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:43,350
than you, Larry Daley of Daley Devices, can possibly imagine.

352
00:29:43,594 --> 00:29:47,530
Bringing things back to life is just a parlor trick.

353
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:50,829
With it, I shall unlock the Gate to the Underworld

354
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:54,530
and bring forth my army from the Land of the Dead.

355
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:57,540
So, if it's not too much trouble...

356
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:02,445
...hand it over.

357
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:06,581
Okay, here you go.

358
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,677
Wise decision.

359
00:30:12,923 --> 00:30:15,687
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I thought you wanted the Cube, but...

360
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,720
The Cube?

361
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:24,833
The Cube of Rubik.

362
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:33,304
All right, what is this Cube of Rubik, then?

363
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:38,347
The Cube. You know, the one that turns all who oppose you to dust?

364
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:41,349
That one? Whatever. I thought...

365
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:43,443
It was my bad, 'cause... You know what? By the way,

366
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:45,148
your brother didn't want to mess with it, either.

367
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:46,587
Yeah, he wanted to play it safe, too.

368
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:49,683
Just, you sort of struck me as a next-level sort of guy, so I was...

369
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:54,161
I am not my brother, Larry.

370
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:58,724
I will kill you and your friends in the blink of an eye.

371
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:04,437
Now take me to this Cube of Rubik.

372
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:08,842
- Here it is. - Open it.

373
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:40,333
Come back here! Come back here with my tablet!

374
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,969
I still have your friends!

375
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:22,976
- Take the wheel! - What?

376
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:26,579
I said, take the wheel! Oh, we're in it now! I love it! I love it!

377
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:28,718
Just keep her straight, I'll handle the rest.

378
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,817
Now, charge!

379
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:39,465
Okay, so what's the plan here?

380
00:32:39,465 --> 00:32:41,729
We're Americans! We don't plan, we do!

381
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:43,568
Now hold on!

382
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:58,547
See that? Act first, think later! Works every time!

383
00:32:58,622 --> 00:32:59,987
You're in good hands!

384
00:33:00,124 --> 00:33:03,821
General George A. Custer of the Fighting U.S. 7th Cavalry,

385
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:05,554
at your service.

386
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:12,292
I'm good, I'm good! Fly, you fool!

387
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:24,178
What's the rumpus, ace?

388
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:25,612
Look, lady, could you get out of the way?

389
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:28,277
Lady? Who are you calling lady? The name is Amelia.

390
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:37,350
Amelia Earhart! Perhaps you've heard of me?

391
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:40,225
Oh, right. You're a famous pilot or whatever.

392
00:33:40,331 --> 00:33:43,027
Pilot? I was the first woman to fly the Atlantic!

393
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:44,725
First woman to receive the Flying Cross,

394
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:47,827
first woman to fly across the 48 states in a gyroprop.

395
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:50,738
Now if you'd wipe that perhaps-permanent look of alarm off your kisser,

396
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:55,039
I was wondering if you might be so kind as to tell me exactly where I am.

397
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:57,512
You're in a museum. Or, actually, under it.

398
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:00,379
And I'm in kind of a dangerous situation right now,

399
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:02,919
so you might not want to be anywhere near me.

400
00:34:05,422 --> 00:34:07,390
- Wow, you're fast. - What's your name, flyboy?

401
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:10,219
My name is Larry Daley.

402
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:13,196
Well, Larry Daley, in case you weren't listening,

403
00:34:13,263 --> 00:34:15,390
I'm not one to shy away from danger.

404
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:19,225
How about spears? Are you one to shy away from spears?

405
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:24,096
Let's ankle, skipper! Now we're gonna have some fun.

406
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:31,875
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, bingo!

407
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:35,743
Like a Golden Fleece.

408
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:40,248
All right, troops, when your enemies captured me,

409
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:42,485
they made themselves my enemies as well.

410
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,956
Big mistake. Big mistake.

411
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:50,759
All right, here's the plan.

412
00:34:51,602 --> 00:34:55,470
On the third bugle blast, I shall loudly announce, "Attack!"

413
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:03,676
At which point, we will all jump out of this box

414
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,974
and attack.

415
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:17,458
Mind bomb. What do you think?

416
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:22,454
You, Sacaja...

417
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:23,761
That is not my name.

418
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,859
- Sacajamea. - No.

419
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:28,199
- Sack-in-a-box. - No.

420
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:29,670
Cinco de Mayo.

421
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,035
I know you are a famous general...

422
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:33,473
That's all right, that's all right. I'm a person, just like you.

423
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:36,704
But won't yelling, "Attack!" Alert the enemy

424
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:38,304
that we are about to attack?

425
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:40,147
What?

426
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:50,559
Yeah, I guess so.

427
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,432
You're quite the popular fellow, Mr. Daley.

428
00:35:58,502 --> 00:35:59,992
Why don't you just skedaddle?

429
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,038
I can't skedaddle. My friends are being held down there.

430
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:04,835
I got to go get them. I got to find another way down.

431
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,386
This is new.

432
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:26,753
Hey, it's all right. I don't want to hurt you.

433
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,524
I don't think it's you they're afraid of, Mr. Daley.

434
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,275
Trade you. Thanks.

435
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:44,211
Back off! Just back off!

436
00:36:45,415 --> 00:36:47,042
I will fork you!

437
00:36:47,384 --> 00:36:48,874
How about you, huh?

438
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:53,417
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

439
00:36:53,524 --> 00:36:56,220
I spent two weeks spear-hunting with a tribe in Micronesia.

440
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:00,153
The Micronesians had much slower reflexes.

441
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:05,198
Come on!

442
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,573
It's over! It's over! It's all over!

443
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:20,844
Well, this is one humdinger of a hootenanny.

444
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:29,356
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

445
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:33,426
Wow, four bars in 1945.

446
00:37:33,497 --> 00:37:35,021
- Hello? - Dad, finally!

447
00:37:35,132 --> 00:37:36,759
I've been studying these plans to the Archives.

448
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:38,433
Looks like once you get down the stairwell...

449
00:37:38,502 --> 00:37:40,470
Oh, I'm way past the stairwell, Nicky.

450
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:42,664
- So you found everyone? - Sort of.

451
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:44,638
What is that flibberty-widget you are talking to?

452
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,676
- Who's that? - It's Amelia Earhart.

453
00:37:46,777 --> 00:37:48,438
You found Amelia Earhart?

454
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:49,672
I... Hey!

455
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,648
- Wait a minute! - Buddy, what's your hurry?

456
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:55,332
Didn't you hear? The war's over!

457
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:56,948
Sorry. These guys are chasing me.

458
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,853
What? What am I looking at, Mardi Gras?

459
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:03,290
- What unit are you from? - I'm from Brooklyn.

460
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,660
What? Are you serious? I'm from Flatbush! Hey, fellas!

461
00:38:07,798 --> 00:38:09,959
These so-and-so's are trying to rough up my pal here

462
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,364
just 'cause he's from Brooklyn!

463
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:13,197
- Thank you! - You got it! Fight!

464
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,631
Hey, mister! You forgot your...

465
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:24,908
What the heck is this thing?

466
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:33,748
Excuse me. Mind if I get in here?

467
00:38:38,328 --> 00:38:40,228
Any time you're done, Mr. Daley.

468
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:43,160
- Call me! - Thank you for that.

469
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:45,360
So you're quite the smooth operator, aren't you, Mr. Daley?

470
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,168
Quick!

471
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:56,904
- That actually worked. - What's next?

472
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:59,448
Look, nothing personal, but I'm kind of in the middle of something here

473
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:01,039
that's not really your fight.

474
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:02,847
It's because I'm a woman, isn't it?

475
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:06,614
No, it's because I've got this ancient raised-from-the-dead evil Pharaoh guy

476
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:09,749
who's willing to kill me and probably anyone near me to get this tablet

477
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,088
so he can rule the world.

478
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:13,219
So it is because I'm a woman!

479
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:14,593
- Look, I... - No, you look, Mr. Daley!

480
00:39:14,698 --> 00:39:17,098
If it weren't for me, you'd still be lost in that monochromatic mayhem!

481
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,566
- Lost in what? - Black and white photo, you boob!

482
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:21,797
Now listen, and listen good. I can help you.

483
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:24,897
I want to help you, and not because I like you, which so far I don't,

484
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:28,570
but because I smell adventure, and, damn it, I want in.

485
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:33,148
Okay. Don't blame me if something happens to you.

486
00:39:33,817 --> 00:39:35,216
I should be so lucky.

487
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:40,780
I am Kahmunrah. I am half god,

488
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:44,059
once removed on my mother's side,

489
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:48,655
rightful ruler of Egypt, future ruler of...

490
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,224
Well, everything else.

491
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:54,394
Now, I have lost some men.

492
00:39:55,005 --> 00:40:00,068
So, I am in need of some new generals to join me in my little plan

493
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:02,134
of conquering this world.

494
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:04,407
Ivan the Terrible.

495
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:08,513
Napoleon Bonaparte.

496
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:10,609
And young Al Capone.

497
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:11,745
Yeah.

498
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:17,624
Some of the most despicable, most feared leaders in all of history.

499
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:19,793
Gentlemen,

500
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:23,930
really, it's just fantastic to meet you all.

501
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,490
- And us, too. - And me, you.

502
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:30,873
All I ask is your allegiance, and in return, I offer you the world.

503
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:33,402
Literally. Are there any questions?

504
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,411
Yeah, I got one. How come you're wearing a dress?

505
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,012
This is not a dress. This is a tunic.

506
00:40:39,516 --> 00:40:42,508
It was the height of fashion 3,000 years ago, I assure you.

507
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,352
Are there any other questions?

508
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:48,152
Da. This dress you're wearing,

509
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:50,489
do we have to wear one of these, too?

510
00:40:51,895 --> 00:40:54,523
Were you not listening? I just told Mr. Capone here

511
00:40:54,598 --> 00:40:56,225
that this is not a dress.

512
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,996
It is, in fact, a tunic. Very big difference.

513
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:02,862
Are there any other questions?

514
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,840
Any questions not about the dress?

515
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,941
Tunic?

516
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:10,580
All right, then. Moonlight is wasting,

517
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,705
- and the time is short. - Short?

518
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:16,081
Why do you look at me when you say "short"?

519
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:19,550
Sorry. It slipped out.

520
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:25,689
Da. If we are talking about world domination,

521
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:27,593
then of course, I am interested.

522
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:31,461
But first I want to clarify something so you know what you are getting.

523
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:35,137
People always say, "Ivan the Terrible, he's so terrible.

524
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:37,934
"I'm so scared of Ivan. He's bad news."

525
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,874
When in fact, the correct translation is

526
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:43,804
"Ivan the Awesome".

527
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:46,542
Ivan the Awesome?

528
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:49,209
It's not really as catchy, is it?

529
00:41:49,286 --> 00:41:52,153
I mean, "Ivan the Terrible", that really pops.

530
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:55,914
But I wasn't terrible. In fact, I was quite an effective leader.

531
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:59,655
Duly noted. Now, I'd like to wrap up the old meet-and-greet

532
00:41:59,763 --> 00:42:02,095
by asking you gentlemen a question.

533
00:42:02,165 --> 00:42:04,463
Are you with me?

534
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:06,391
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. - Oui.

535
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:11,232
- Da, but... - Then bring Larry Daley of Daley Devices

536
00:42:11,308 --> 00:42:14,277
and the Golden Tablet of Ahkmenrah to me!

537
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:19,911
We'll get you back down to your chums, Mr. Daley.

538
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:22,577
You won't get lost following Amelia Earhart.

539
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:25,152
Quick, get down.

540
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:31,594
Well, well, Mr. Daley, I quite like the way you're holding me.

541
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:35,754
No. Sorry, I wasn't trying to...

542
00:42:35,832 --> 00:42:37,823
Oh, please, stop beating your gums, Mr. Daley.

543
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:40,164
You haven't been able to take your cheaters off my chassis

544
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,862
since the moment we met.

545
00:42:41,972 --> 00:42:44,270
I literally didn't understand one word of that.

546
00:42:48,945 --> 00:42:51,505
Is it just me or is there music in the air?

547
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:56,143
# ... my baby, we can make it shine We can take forever... #

548
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:59,052
You! Little flying angel things! Quiet!

549
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:01,680
They're cupids, Mr. Daley. Gods of love.

550
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:05,488
Great. Gods of love, would you shut up? Please shut up. We're trying to hide.

551
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,426
# Yeah! More than a woman! Yeah! #

552
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:14,732
No, don't change the arrangement, it's not about the arrangement. Quiet!

553
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:16,737
Kick the chorus, y'all!

554
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,467
More than a woman

555
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,833
Yo, show me what you got, night guard!

556
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:22,242
All right, come on. Let's go.

557
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:24,973
# More than a woman to me #

558
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:27,543
# More than a woman #

559
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:29,983
# She's more than a woman #

560
00:43:35,558 --> 00:43:41,360
And so, the little tiny man who could not be a smaller or shorter mouse

561
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:44,195
runs into the claws of the giant cat!

562
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:47,035
You're really hung up on the height, aren't you?

563
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:48,934
- No, it's not about height, see... - Yes, you are.

564
00:43:49,005 --> 00:43:51,030
You're saying I'm a little mouse, you're a giant cat.

565
00:43:51,107 --> 00:43:54,099
- I am the giant cat. - No offense, I just...

566
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,111
You're Napoleon. There's a complex named after you.

567
00:43:57,213 --> 00:43:59,306
You're famous for being little, and it's true. Look.

568
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,976
Oh, you naive American man-boy.

569
00:44:02,085 --> 00:44:04,952
Look. Neither of us are gonna be jamming anytime soon, right?

570
00:44:05,055 --> 00:44:07,387
So it's not like we should... It's not even an issue.

571
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:11,985
It's not about height or something else. It's a plan. It's a brilliant plan.

572
00:44:12,629 --> 00:44:15,154
- So it was a plan. - Snazzy maneuver, Emperor.

573
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,867
Merci, mademoiselle.

574
00:44:18,935 --> 00:44:22,098
Now, if your boyfriend would kindly come with me...

575
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:23,571
I'm not her boyfriend.

576
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,270
- Not her boyfriend. - No.

577
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:29,067
Just friends?

578
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:35,744
- Yeah, friends. - Acquaintances. Friends.

579
00:44:38,188 --> 00:44:39,849
Were you guys, like, friends in college

580
00:44:39,956 --> 00:44:42,424
and just afraid now to both ruin your relationship

581
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:44,858
by telling the other person that you want to be more than friends,

582
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:46,485
that you like-like each other?

583
00:44:49,032 --> 00:44:52,126
One more time? I'm sorry. I didn't catch the...

584
00:44:53,036 --> 00:44:54,663
Were you guys, like, friends in college

585
00:44:54,771 --> 00:44:56,602
and now both afraid to ruin your relationship

586
00:44:56,673 --> 00:44:59,437
by telling the other person that you want to be more than friends,

587
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:01,534
that you like-like each other?

588
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,043
- No. - No?

589
00:45:06,149 --> 00:45:09,209
I just love the nitty-gritty of relationships. All us French do.

590
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:10,877
- Great. - Yes. Amour!

591
00:45:10,987 --> 00:45:12,215
- Now. - Yeah?

592
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:14,620
- This way, or you die. - Yes.

593
00:45:18,995 --> 00:45:22,362
- Wait, I'm coming with you! - No! Our fight is not with you.

594
00:45:26,169 --> 00:45:29,661
...so you gotta bet a second time. - All right. Okay.

595
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:34,272
My hair is currency in certain parts of Europe.

596
00:45:34,377 --> 00:45:37,437
It's true. Currency, like gold or paper money.

597
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:40,446
The Duomo was purchased with just one locket.

598
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:41,914
Listen up, kemosabe.

599
00:45:42,018 --> 00:45:45,852
This rodeo clown wouldn't know a flapjack from a flyswatter.

600
00:45:45,922 --> 00:45:48,220
Now, Gigantor's out there risking his hide for us.

601
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:50,259
The least we can do is give him some help.

602
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:55,024
Some big help. But we can't very well do that if we're stuck in here, now, can we?

603
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:57,464
We need to escape.

604
00:45:58,568 --> 00:45:59,728
What's a flapjack?

605
00:45:59,803 --> 00:46:02,237
It's like a biscuit or a scone.

606
00:46:02,305 --> 00:46:04,705
- Chest bump? - Yeah.

607
00:46:05,775 --> 00:46:07,538
Then deadly. Watch.

608
00:46:07,944 --> 00:46:10,640
Guard your cards, okay? Now you bet.

609
00:46:11,214 --> 00:46:13,307
Okay, now you got to throw some cards down.

610
00:46:15,785 --> 00:46:17,650
- Ready? - Ready.

611
00:46:17,987 --> 00:46:21,923
Say something. Say anything. This is no fun. You're supposed to...

612
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,560
- Hey! What are you two doing out here? - Octavius, go!

613
00:46:26,629 --> 00:46:29,757
- You, make a run for it, I'll hold them off! - I will not leave you!

614
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:33,098
Ain't no time for your Roman melodrama! Now, get! Go!

615
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,060
Old Jedediah will be fine.

616
00:46:35,138 --> 00:46:36,435
Now, you're in real trouble.

617
00:46:41,144 --> 00:46:43,772
Why, these aren't real rubies at all.

618
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:46,345
Ruby slippers indeed.

619
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,748
But, whoever you are, Archie Bunker,

620
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:54,247
you had one comfortable throne.

621
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:56,589
Hey, boss.

622
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:59,924
Caught this one trying to escape through a rust hole in the crate.

623
00:46:59,996 --> 00:47:01,827
One of his little friends got away.

624
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:05,458
Oh, please. What damage could they possibly do?

625
00:47:05,535 --> 00:47:09,471
Why, they're no bigger than a little grain of couscous. Aren't you?

626
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:11,769
You know, two words come to mind when I hear you talk.

627
00:47:12,175 --> 00:47:14,302
"Delusional" and "weirdo".

628
00:47:14,878 --> 00:47:18,245
And if I had to say a third, "goofy". Just goofy.

629
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:22,240
Now you let old Jedediah out of here or he's gonna get angry.

630
00:47:22,652 --> 00:47:24,244
Well played, Jedediah!

631
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:28,051
I'm sorry, I can't take you seriously. You're just adorable,

632
00:47:28,558 --> 00:47:30,753
even when you're threatening me. It's hilarious.

633
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,990
Is it just me, or are these guys unbelievably cute?

634
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:36,190
Now hold it a second, now.

635
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:38,996
Now, you have a right to keep me as your captive, torture me, even,

636
00:47:39,068 --> 00:47:41,502
but don't call me cute! I ain't cute!

637
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:46,599
Steady, my friend! Just stay alive! I will find you!

638
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:53,875
Gigantor. No!

639
00:47:54,517 --> 00:47:58,749
Hello, Mr. Daley. Nice to see you again.

640
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,956
Now, if you don't mind, I shall take that from you.

641
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:05,926
Thank you.

642
00:48:07,063 --> 00:48:11,523
Finally. Finally! After 3,000 years,

643
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:18,736
my evil army of the damned, my beautiful, beautiful army,

644
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:23,575
shall be unleashed!

645
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:34,713
I'm afraid that Mother and Father may have

646
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,726
slightly changed the combination on me.

647
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:41,230
I guess this whole unleashing-the-underworld thing

648
00:48:41,297 --> 00:48:43,561
isn't really working out for you, huh?

649
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:46,830
It must be really frustrating, 'cause you've waited thousands of years

650
00:48:46,936 --> 00:48:48,733
to come back from the dead and everything,

651
00:48:48,805 --> 00:48:52,172
and now you can't get it open.

652
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:56,140
Fear not, for I shall wait a thousand more if I must.

653
00:48:56,246 --> 00:49:00,307
Good, 'cause in a few hours you'll be standing here in a frustrated position,

654
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:04,011
frozen, and I'll walk out of here with my buddies and that'll be that.

655
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,246
So, I got all night.

656
00:49:05,822 --> 00:49:08,916
Really? All night? Well!

657
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:10,949
He doesn't.

658
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:22,160
Open that cage.

659
00:49:22,272 --> 00:49:25,332
- What are you doing? - No touching! No touching!

660
00:49:25,441 --> 00:49:26,874
Don't you manhandle me!

661
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,108
- Look, he's having a little tantrum. - Jed?

662
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:34,473
Don't you squirm! Don't squirm. It'll only be worse for you.

663
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,780
- Put him down! - Don't be afraid.

664
00:49:36,853 --> 00:49:38,445
I shan't hurt you.

665
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:40,854
I lied.

666
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:45,558
I don't think he has all night at all, Mr. Daley.

667
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:50,395
From the looks of things, I'd say he has a little over an hour.

668
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,127
Take me out of here!

669
00:49:53,903 --> 00:49:57,964
You were the guardian! You know all about this tablet.

670
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:01,238
You're obviously much more clever than the rest of us.

671
00:50:01,311 --> 00:50:03,404
You may or may not know the combination,

672
00:50:03,513 --> 00:50:06,778
but I am going to give you exactly one hour to figure it out.

673
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:09,818
If you do not, I shall kill your friends.

674
00:50:09,886 --> 00:50:13,845
And please don't think about escaping, for I shall be watching you.

675
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:15,720
Look, I don't even know how to begin

676
00:50:15,825 --> 00:50:17,986
to decipher this thing, all right? Really.

677
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:19,688
What a pity.

678
00:50:19,762 --> 00:50:23,596
And your little cowboy friend seemed like such a charming little fellow.

679
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:29,838
Ah, well. Tick-tock, Mr. Daley. Your hour has begun.

680
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:34,707
Hey! You got this, partner. I know you do.

681
00:50:41,851 --> 00:50:45,082
You got this!

682
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:55,453
There you are! Are you all right? I've been worried sick! Sick I tell you.

683
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:58,329
- No, I'm fine. - So what's our next move, partner?

684
00:50:58,401 --> 00:51:01,063
I don't know. I just got to get this tablet translated.

685
00:51:02,538 --> 00:51:04,130
Oh, great! This guy again.

686
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:07,040
Look, buddy, we don't want any trouble, all right?

687
00:51:18,154 --> 00:51:19,485
Look at that!

688
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:21,352
I guess our sassy cephalopod was just a fish

689
00:51:21,352 --> 00:51:23,116
who didn't like being out of water.

690
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,961
He's not such a ballywagger after all.

691
00:51:29,966 --> 00:51:32,332
Okay. Glad you're happy.

692
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:44,009
Hello? A little assistance?

693
00:51:44,847 --> 00:51:46,838
- Hey, Teddy! Perfect! - Yes!

694
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:48,075
Maybe you could help us.

695
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:49,743
I'd love to help you, but first things first.

696
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:52,151
My nose is so itchy, it's driving me insane.

697
00:51:52,255 --> 00:51:55,520
I hate to ask, but, as you see, I'm missing a few body parts.

698
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:58,822
- Could you please give us a scratch? - Yeah, sure.

699
00:51:59,796 --> 00:52:02,822
Oh, yes! That's exquisite. A little over there...

700
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:04,126
- Yes! - More?

701
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,464
Oh, yes! Yes! Oh, that's...

702
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,695
Sweet rutabaga pie, that was divine.

703
00:52:10,206 --> 00:52:11,764
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

704
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:14,701
Twenty-sixth President of the United States, Rough Rider,

705
00:52:14,777 --> 00:52:16,836
founder of the national parks, and a whole bunch of other stuff.

706
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,977
- Have we met? - No, there's another Teddy.

707
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,331
We have one of you in New York.

708
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:25,612
Really? What's he like, this other me?

709
00:52:25,822 --> 00:52:28,950
He's pretty much the same, except with...

710
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:31,118
Except what? Say it. Except with a body?

711
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:33,628
- Yes. He has a body. - Oh, dash it, the pain!

712
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,061
- And a horse. - Excuse me!

713
00:52:36,165 --> 00:52:38,793
We really need someone to translate what's written on this tablet.

714
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:42,399
- Do you read hieroglyphics? - Yes, I do, missy.

715
00:52:42,505 --> 00:52:44,234
That's a simple one.

716
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:48,367
Bird. Man with spear. Sideways fish. Beetle. Vase.

717
00:52:49,245 --> 00:52:51,076
Okay, and what does that mean?

718
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,240
It means, and this is just a rough translation,

719
00:52:55,151 --> 00:52:57,199
"A man with a spear trapped a bird

720
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:59,247
and a sideways fish in a vase."

721
00:53:01,591 --> 00:53:03,252
"And there was also a beetle."

722
00:53:05,328 --> 00:53:08,297
- I don't think that's it. - That's just one possible translation.

723
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:09,888
Another possible translation is,

724
00:53:09,966 --> 00:53:11,934
"You will find the combination you seek

725
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:15,835
"if you figure out the secret at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb."

726
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:17,655
Okay, and what does that mean?

727
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:19,072
I don't know! What am I, the Sphinx?

728
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:20,256
"What's this? What's that?"

729
00:53:20,256 --> 00:53:21,371
Why don't you ask New York Teddy?

730
00:53:21,444 --> 00:53:23,844
I'm sure he'd love to get his grabby little fingers all over that thing!

731
00:53:23,913 --> 00:53:25,540
Probably let his horse lick it, too!

732
00:53:25,615 --> 00:53:28,015
Mr. Daley, we should be going to the sculpture gallery.

733
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,245
I think there's someone there who might have a better thought on this.

734
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,988
The fellow we're looking for is just down here.

735
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,388
- Bonsoir. - Hello, young lady.

736
00:53:36,893 --> 00:53:39,953
Hey, excuse me. Could we keep moving, please?

737
00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:43,089
We certainly could, but then we might miss a rare opportunity.

738
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,724
I mean, she is a Degas, Mr. Daley.

739
00:53:45,801 --> 00:53:47,962
Okay, it's just I got a little buddy stuck in an hourglass,

740
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:49,799
I got a pitch meeting at Wal-Mart in the morning...

741
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:53,273
- It would be great if we could... - He's right here.

742
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:55,804
I think he'll have a thought on this.

743
00:53:56,145 --> 00:53:59,046
Mr. Thinker, we're sorry to interrupt your contemplation,

744
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:03,345
but we really need to figure out the secret at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

745
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:06,782
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

746
00:54:08,257 --> 00:54:09,781
I'm thinking.

747
00:54:10,726 --> 00:54:15,163
- I'm thinking. - It's not happening with him.

748
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:17,196
Oh, wow.

749
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:20,633
You've gotta be kidding me. Check that out!

750
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:24,599
- Oh, yeah. - Hey! Hey!

751
00:54:24,674 --> 00:54:26,335
Buddy! Over here! This is serious.

752
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:28,240
Apparently, it's a matter of life and death.

753
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:30,475
I'll tell you what's a matter of life and death.

754
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,275
That beautiful lady over there.

755
00:54:32,348 --> 00:54:35,806
Hey, baby! Check out the gun show going on over here!

756
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,844
Firepower!

757
00:54:39,255 --> 00:54:41,314
He's certainly no Einstein.

758
00:54:41,424 --> 00:54:44,257
- Biceps! Deltoids... - Yeah.

759
00:54:44,327 --> 00:54:47,592
- Wait a minute. I saw a bunch of those. - A bunch of whats?

760
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:49,460
- Little Einsteins. - Where?

761
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:52,490
Over there, in Air and Space.

762
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,098
I gotta get over there.

763
00:54:55,638 --> 00:54:56,764
What?

764
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:00,331
- Nothing. - Okay. Then why are you staring at me?

765
00:55:00,977 --> 00:55:02,672
I don't wanna miss a moment.

766
00:55:02,778 --> 00:55:05,110
All right, good, but we should get going, 'cause we...

767
00:55:06,282 --> 00:55:08,750
- Why? - You talk too much, ace.

768
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:15,188
I don't know why I did that, Mr. Daley.

769
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:18,385
I just feel as if I've been asleep for a long time and now, suddenly,

770
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:20,022
I'm awake.

771
00:55:20,296 --> 00:55:22,161
I can explain that...

772
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:24,795
But really, I could. I really...

773
00:55:25,668 --> 00:55:27,226
Again, why?

774
00:55:32,475 --> 00:55:33,806
Great, you're back.

775
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:40,814
Okay. Yeah. Great.

776
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:43,977
Love theme from Titanic. Good, but not really appropriate.

777
00:55:47,823 --> 00:55:50,553
You don't let yourself enjoy things much, do you, Mr. Daley?

778
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:54,628
Okay, you know what? It's not really the song choice.

779
00:55:54,697 --> 00:55:56,562
And by the way, you're a little pitchy.

780
00:55:56,632 --> 00:55:59,726
Well, I thought you were amazing, and you look wonderful.

781
00:56:01,404 --> 00:56:03,304
Could you just fly away, please?

782
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,903
And so the adventure continues.

783
00:56:08,878 --> 00:56:12,075
What did I tell you? Enough!

784
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:24,555
You know, I do sort of feel like a floating butterfly.

785
00:56:24,994 --> 00:56:27,485
You are crazier than a road lizard.

786
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:31,623
Mr. Egypt, these two here heard that we're taking over the world

787
00:56:31,734 --> 00:56:34,669
and they want in. I don't know who they are,

788
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,137
but they're on exhibit here, too, apparently.

789
00:56:39,008 --> 00:56:41,169
I don't even know what they are.

790
00:56:41,277 --> 00:56:46,408
I'm sorry, but we're all full up in our axis of evil today. Sorry.

791
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:49,645
Come on! But I'm bad! I'm bad!

792
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:52,243
Hey, I could show you how bad I am!

793
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:55,350
Fear me!

794
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,121
I'm sorry. I'm just not buying it.

795
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:03,632
You don't seem very bad. You just seem sort of vaguely grouchy to me.

796
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:05,932
Oh, boy.

797
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:10,298
What are you doing? What is that? What is this?

798
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:12,636
What does it mean? You've lost me.

799
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:16,371
Is that you breathing? Because I can't hear myself think.

800
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:20,139
Can I make one suggestion to you, my friend? Just simplify.

801
00:57:20,216 --> 00:57:22,650
There's just too much going on here.

802
00:57:22,718 --> 00:57:24,965
You're evil, you're asthmatic, you're a robot...

803
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:27,212
And what is the cape for?

804
00:57:27,323 --> 00:57:29,883
Are we going to the opera? I don't think so.

805
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:32,119
Sorry! Goodbye.

806
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:33,718
Attention!

807
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:35,694
He's leaving with the tablet!

808
00:57:36,398 --> 00:57:37,956
Where?

809
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:40,734
Give me that.

810
00:57:41,303 --> 00:57:45,330
He's not trying to figure out the... He's trying to escape!

811
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:49,468
Go. Go! All of you! Kill him! And bring me that tablet.

812
00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:53,239
Come on, people! Let's go! Without that tablet, we've nothing!

813
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:55,078
Streltsy! Go!

814
00:57:57,686 --> 00:58:01,087
Thought you could get away, didn't you, Larry Daley?

815
00:58:09,532 --> 00:58:11,090
Criminy, we're jimmy-jacked.

816
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,327
- Jimmy-jacked? Really? - It's the way I speak.

817
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:15,666
Yeah, I know, but that one sounds made up, even for you.

818
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:17,786
"Oh, no, our path has been blocked by bad people."

819
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,834
What's the fun in that?

820
00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:22,671
The point is, we're not getting into the Air and Space right now.

821
00:58:22,745 --> 00:58:24,770
- You're right. We are jimmy-jacked. - Jimmy-jacked.

822
00:58:25,247 --> 00:58:26,612
Come on.

823
00:58:36,592 --> 00:58:38,924
They say a good man rules this union.

824
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:41,860
I promised Jedediah I would bring help,

825
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:44,366
and help I will bring.

826
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:51,202
Charge!

827
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,120
Misjudged the distance.

828
00:59:09,992 --> 00:59:11,425
Who's there?

829
00:59:17,299 --> 00:59:18,926
Jupiter, protect me.

830
00:59:23,672 --> 00:59:26,698
Remain very still.

831
00:59:27,443 --> 00:59:29,741
They can sense movement.

832
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:34,680
Apparently, they can also hear me talking to myself.

833
00:59:37,152 --> 00:59:38,915
I'm not a nut.

834
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:42,181
No!

835
00:59:49,098 --> 00:59:51,157
We should be okay in here for a while.

836
00:59:56,205 --> 00:59:58,469
So, how long have you guarded antiquities?

837
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,202
What? Oh, no, I don't actually work at the...

838
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,107
I just thought with the fancy getup and all...

839
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:05,302
No, I borrowed this.

840
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:10,342
I mean, I was a guard back in New York, but that was a while ago.

841
01:00:12,121 --> 01:00:14,385
So why did you leave? Did you not enjoy it?

842
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,117
No, I loved it. I just...

843
01:00:16,191 --> 01:00:19,058
Things sort of took off in a different direction, so...

844
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:22,619
- So what do you do now? - Well, I sort of...

845
01:00:23,565 --> 01:00:26,363
Well, I sort of design products and sell them.

846
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:28,565
- You're an inventor! - I am.

847
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:30,536
I am an inventor, yeah. I invent stuff.

848
01:00:30,806 --> 01:00:32,330
Like the rocket ship?

849
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:34,069
- No. - The sea plane.

850
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:36,974
- The dirigible? - No, not aircraft.

851
01:00:37,046 --> 01:00:39,844
Sort of like more small-scale stuff, like...

852
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:44,141
Well, the Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight, that was mine.

853
01:00:46,155 --> 01:00:47,850
So this new job, do you like it?

854
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:52,019
Yeah, I like it a lot. It's exciting. It's...

855
01:00:53,662 --> 01:00:55,926
- What? - I'm just confused, is all.

856
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:58,226
If you're not excited by it, why do you do it?

857
01:00:58,734 --> 01:01:02,431
- I am excited by it. I just said... - I know what you said, Mr. Daley,

858
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:05,871
but what I see in front of me is a man who's lost his moxie.

859
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:09,337
I have not lost my...

860
01:01:09,678 --> 01:01:11,509
I got my moxie.

861
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:13,371
Do you know why I became a pilot?

862
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,917
- I don't, no. - For the fun of it.

863
01:01:18,954 --> 01:01:20,922
Why else would anyone do anything?

864
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,118
Great Gatsby!

865
01:01:27,629 --> 01:01:31,190
Blast these pigeons and their incessant cooing!

866
01:01:31,266 --> 01:01:34,201
- No! Mr. President! Sir! - All right. Time to see the state...

867
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:37,534
- Please don't get up! ...of this great union! I always say,

868
01:01:37,606 --> 01:01:41,303
leave nothing for tomorrow which can be done today.

869
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,435
Sir, if you go out there, you're gonna freak a lot of people out!

870
01:01:43,545 --> 01:01:47,311
Freak? I assure you, sir, I am no freak.

871
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:51,819
- No, I didn't mean you're a freak... - Come here, little one.

872
01:01:52,721 --> 01:01:55,952
In fact, if anyone is freakish, I'm afraid it's you, sir.

873
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,291
The truth is, you are very small.

874
01:01:59,395 --> 01:02:02,091
And I mean even for a regular-sized human.

875
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:04,928
What? Why would you even say that?

876
01:02:05,234 --> 01:02:07,395
I must be honest.

877
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:10,836
Right. Okay, Honest Abe. Of course. I'm sorry. Great.

878
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:13,237
Come, now, Mr. President, put the little man down

879
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:15,572
and let's sit our fanny back in that throne of yours.

880
01:02:15,644 --> 01:02:19,136
You have a can-do attitude, and I shall do as you ask.

881
01:02:19,248 --> 01:02:20,840
Thank you.

882
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,015
- There you go. - Thank you.

883
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:27,521
It's that very can-do spirit that has defined this remarkable nation of ours.

884
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,113
- Interesting story. - They're coming.

885
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:30,488
One night in Gettysburg...

886
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:32,321
Mr. President, we're gonna need you to hold still now.

887
01:02:32,428 --> 01:02:34,157
- What? - Abraham, freeze!

888
01:02:34,263 --> 01:02:36,026
Freeze? I...

889
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:45,364
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

890
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:47,965
- Come on, let's get to Air and Space. - Lf I may,

891
01:02:48,043 --> 01:02:51,479
- you two make an adorable couple. - Oh, no, we're not...

892
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:53,208
No, we're not a... I mean, we're not a...

893
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:56,512
"We're not a... I mean, we're not a..."

894
01:02:56,618 --> 01:02:58,142
I never lie!

895
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:02,014
The truth is, you two are adorable together.

896
01:03:02,124 --> 01:03:03,557
Thank you. Good night.

897
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:09,120
Farewell, lovely lady and small, little man.

898
01:03:10,566 --> 01:03:13,330
Now let's see if we can find these Einsteins of yours.

899
01:03:30,786 --> 01:03:33,254
One giant leap for a mannequin...

900
01:03:33,956 --> 01:03:38,950
D.C., this is Air and Space. We are back online and fully operational.

901
01:03:44,066 --> 01:03:48,127
The Tuskegee Airmen are on the march once again.

902
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:52,196
Can you stop narrating everything we're doing? Just live in the moment.

903
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:55,835
The Tuskegee Airmen are living in the moment!

904
01:03:55,911 --> 01:03:57,344
- Miss Earhart? - Yes.

905
01:03:57,412 --> 01:03:59,573
- I wanna say thank you. - What for, Captain?

906
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:01,945
A lot of people didn't think we could fly, either.

907
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,211
Thanks for clearing the runway, ma'am.

908
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,953
- Race you to Paris? - You're on!

909
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:11,389
No! Not now! We gotta...

910
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,724
- It's just a quick jaunt over the pond. - No. Gotta find the Einsteins.

911
01:04:13,795 --> 01:04:16,889
Come on, we gotta go. We don't have time. Come on!

912
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:19,297
Sorry, it's in the blood.

913
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:21,627
There she is, Mr. Daley.

914
01:04:21,737 --> 01:04:25,366
Old Bessie, the old family bus. That gal took me across the Atlantic!

915
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,408
Okay. I think the Einsteins are over here, though.

916
01:04:27,476 --> 01:04:30,172
This is Mission Control. Flight check complete.

917
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:32,736
- Where'd you go? Where'd they go? - You are clear for launch.

918
01:04:32,814 --> 01:04:34,281
Contact!

919
01:04:34,383 --> 01:04:36,283
D.C., this is Mission Control.

920
01:04:37,052 --> 01:04:40,146
- No, no! No! - All systems go and green for lift-off.

921
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,723
Roger that. We are green for lift-off.

922
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:45,555
No, we're definitely not green for any kind of lift-off!

923
01:04:45,627 --> 01:04:49,427
- I want a "go, no-go" for launch. - I say no-go. Let's not go.

924
01:04:49,498 --> 01:04:50,590
Go!

925
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,633
Go!

926
01:04:53,402 --> 01:04:55,393
- Go! - No! No go!

927
01:04:55,971 --> 01:04:57,666
Torquing angles incoming.

928
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:59,832
Tone it down with the torque. Torque it down.

929
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:01,500
De-torque. De-torque.

930
01:05:03,412 --> 01:05:05,243
Commence ignition sequence.

931
01:05:05,314 --> 01:05:07,839
- Roger that, flight. - We have launch commit.

932
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:10,111
- No. No, no, no! - Ten,

933
01:05:10,185 --> 01:05:12,449
nine, eight, seven...

934
01:05:12,521 --> 01:05:14,614
- Hey, that's mine. - No, we do not have commit.

935
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:17,625
Repeat. We are decommissioning the committal of the launch

936
01:05:17,693 --> 01:05:23,359
and it is now a negatory launch phase. We are in a no-fly, no-go phase.

937
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:28,164
That is a November-Gorgon phase of non-flying!

938
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:30,135
- Fine! - And we're gonna say good night.

939
01:05:30,205 --> 01:05:32,730
Thank you. Good work. Over and out.

940
01:05:34,109 --> 01:05:36,043
- Sorry. - Damn, that was disappointing.

941
01:05:36,111 --> 01:05:38,079
Come on. I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

942
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,543
Hey, little space monkey.

943
01:05:43,552 --> 01:05:46,487
You're Able. Okay, good. How you doing?

944
01:05:47,122 --> 01:05:48,987
Yes, good. At ease. All right.

945
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:53,225
You're a polite little fella, aren't you?

946
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:56,456
Hey, you happen to know where those little Einstein bobblehead guys are?

947
01:05:57,766 --> 01:06:00,234
Mr. Daley! I found your Einsteins.

948
01:06:00,902 --> 01:06:02,164
Great. Hey...

949
01:06:02,237 --> 01:06:05,866
Gentlemen, we're trying to crack the combination of this tablet doodad,

950
01:06:05,974 --> 01:06:08,465
and the writing here says we'll find it

951
01:06:08,543 --> 01:06:12,001
if we figure out the secret at the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

952
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:16,849
That's an easy one. The answer's in the question.

953
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:19,183
- What does that mean? - "Figure out".

954
01:06:19,254 --> 01:06:21,848
It's a figure! I.e., a number.

955
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:24,756
And the Pharaoh's tomb, i.e. The pyramids.

956
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:27,420
Don't you get it, kid? You're looking for the secret number

957
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:29,394
at the heart of the pyramids.

958
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:32,196
Well, whistle me Dixie, the answer's pi!

959
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:36,095
- Pi? - 3.14159265, to be exact.

960
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:39,264
Yes! 3.1495265.

961
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:42,434
No, no, no, 3.14159265.

962
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:44,603
Yeah, okay, 3.14...

963
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,714
I'm sorry, I can't tell. Is it yes or no? Cause you just...

964
01:06:47,783 --> 01:06:49,512
I know it's hard, could you just...

965
01:06:49,584 --> 01:06:50,915
Don't touch the hair.

966
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:52,799
Sorry, I can't tell if it's up or...

967
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,580
I'm a bobblehead, dummkopf,

968
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:57,853
and that's the way we like it. All together, now!

969
01:06:57,926 --> 01:07:01,953
That's the way We like it

970
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:04,055
You know, we can't all be Einsteins, so...

971
01:07:04,132 --> 01:07:05,292
- I can! - We are!

972
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,924
- He is! - Me, too!

973
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:08,798
- Okay, all right. - Okay, here it is.

974
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:11,372
- Can you slow it down a little bit? - Okay.

975
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,603
3.14159265.

976
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,201
- Okay. 3.14... - I've got it.

977
01:07:17,813 --> 01:07:19,747
- Thank you, Mr. Einsteins. - Thank you.

978
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:26,578
All right. Now, like the brilliant and famous general that I am,

979
01:07:26,655 --> 01:07:28,748
I thought long and hard about what you said,

980
01:07:28,824 --> 01:07:32,817
and I've come up with a brand-new and improved battle plan!

981
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:36,628
Okay.

982
01:07:37,899 --> 01:07:41,892
I will loudly announce that we are not

983
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,837
going to attack, and then...

984
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:47,174
Wait for it.

985
01:07:47,275 --> 01:07:52,406
"What's the amazing Custer about to say now? I hope he's my friend, or..."

986
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:54,571
We attack!

987
01:07:58,186 --> 01:08:01,781
Didn't expect your friend to run off like that, did you?

988
01:08:02,157 --> 01:08:04,489
He's coming back, Ka-Ka-Ro.

989
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:08,359
Sure as moon shines on a mongoose, he'll be here.

990
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,656
I would save my breath if I were you.

991
01:08:11,767 --> 01:08:13,928
You don't have many left.

992
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:19,440
We've got about 10 minutes to get over there to Jed.

993
01:08:19,508 --> 01:08:22,341
I think we make a good team, perhaps more than a team.

994
01:08:22,444 --> 01:08:24,435
Wait. Okay, wait.

995
01:08:24,513 --> 01:08:26,208
What's the matter? You didn't like kissing me?

996
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:28,265
No, I did. It was great. I mean,

997
01:08:28,265 --> 01:08:30,216
the slapping hurt a little bit, but...

998
01:08:30,318 --> 01:08:34,687
- So you don't like me, then. - Of course I like you. You're incredible.

999
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:37,122
I think you're an amazing person. You're...

1000
01:08:37,192 --> 01:08:41,128
It's just there are certain issues that would prevent us from...

1001
01:08:41,196 --> 01:08:45,462
- I just... You're not... - I'm not what, Mr. Daley?

1002
01:08:48,303 --> 01:08:51,295
Okay. You're made of...

1003
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:54,006
Made of...

1004
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:07,214
Wonderful things. You're made of good, wonderful things.

1005
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:14,421
Come on.

1006
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,232
Gentlemen, could you buy us some time please?

1007
01:09:27,576 --> 01:09:28,907
It'll have to do.

1008
01:09:30,445 --> 01:09:33,243
No! That's the first plane ever made!

1009
01:09:33,348 --> 01:09:36,010
It's made out of balsa wood and paper.

1010
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:37,847
It's made out of spruce and canvas

1011
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:39,611
and good old-fashioned American ingenuity.

1012
01:09:40,755 --> 01:09:42,222
Are you coming, or what?

1013
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:50,197
- Out of our way! - I don't think so.

1014
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:53,264
They're getting away!

1015
01:09:57,405 --> 01:10:00,568
Hang on, Mr. Daley. Things are about to get interesting.

1016
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:10,313
A lady pilot! Preposterous!

1017
01:10:10,452 --> 01:10:13,717
- Think again, boys! - Oh, she's good.

1018
01:10:31,473 --> 01:10:33,407
What? What?

1019
01:10:33,475 --> 01:10:35,636
One of the wires is jammed. I'm going to have to loosen it.

1020
01:10:35,744 --> 01:10:37,939
- Here, take the stick! - No! I'm not gonna... No!

1021
01:10:38,013 --> 01:10:39,571
I know you've got moxie in you yet.

1022
01:10:39,648 --> 01:10:43,243
Moxie doesn't fly planes! People who have pilots' licenses fly planes!

1023
01:10:43,318 --> 01:10:44,842
- Okay. - She's all yours.

1024
01:10:47,022 --> 01:10:49,252
I don't want it! I don't want the stick!

1025
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:55,790
Don't look now, Mr. Daley, but you're flying an airplane!

1026
01:11:07,342 --> 01:11:09,003
Able! The doors!

1027
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,954
- Got it! - Pull!

1028
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,564
Pull up!

1029
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:39,799
Yes!

1030
01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:41,569
Godspeed, Amelia Earhart!

1031
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:43,075
Godspeed.

1032
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:24,014
Look a little nervous there, Ramen Noodle.

1033
01:12:24,085 --> 01:12:26,280
'Cause for me, this is like a spa treatment.

1034
01:12:26,688 --> 01:12:30,886
Sand baths are really rejuvenating for the skin. Exfoliates.

1035
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:33,025
Giving up yet?

1036
01:12:33,194 --> 01:12:35,025
Not quite yet, no.

1037
01:12:35,697 --> 01:12:39,827
In fact, let's see if we can't make time fly.

1038
01:12:45,807 --> 01:12:47,468
What is that funny sound?

1039
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:10,822
Stop!

1040
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,400
Right there, please, Mr. Daley.

1041
01:13:14,903 --> 01:13:16,598
Well. Well, well, well!

1042
01:13:17,672 --> 01:13:19,162
You certainly know how to make an entrance, Mr. Daley.

1043
01:13:19,274 --> 01:13:20,673
Time to recruit some backup.

1044
01:13:20,775 --> 01:13:23,243
I hope for your little friend's sake, here,

1045
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:25,677
that you also figured out the combination.

1046
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,304
- Give me Jed. - Oh, no, no, no.

1047
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:30,145
First, give me the combination and hand over that tablet.

1048
01:13:30,251 --> 01:13:31,843
I'll give you the tablet and the combination

1049
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,614
when you release my friends and give him back to me.

1050
01:13:33,755 --> 01:13:37,589
I shall release what I want to release the moment I want to release it.

1051
01:13:37,659 --> 01:13:39,286
Great. And I'll release what I want to release

1052
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,089
at the exact moment that I want to release it, okay?

1053
01:13:41,162 --> 01:13:43,858
Tell me the combination and give me that tablet right now

1054
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:45,933
or I shall kill all of your friends,

1055
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,798
starting with the little shaggy-headed little cowman here.

1056
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:52,271
I ain't shaggy-headed! Gigantor, let me take this guy!

1057
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,968
Don't worry, I got this handled. You don't want to give me my friends,

1058
01:13:55,043 --> 01:13:56,943
then you're not gonna get your combination or your tablet.

1059
01:13:57,011 --> 01:13:58,444
- All right, I'll tell you what. - Good.

1060
01:13:58,513 --> 01:14:01,380
They didn't call me Kahmunrah the Trustworthy for nothing.

1061
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:04,145
Here you go. They didn't call me Kahmunrah the Trustworthy!

1062
01:14:04,219 --> 01:14:06,153
They called me Kahmunrah the Bloodthirsty,

1063
01:14:06,221 --> 01:14:09,850
who kills whoever doesn't give Kahmunrah exactly what he wants

1064
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,256
in the moment that he wants it, which is right now,

1065
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:15,524
when I had also better get the combination and the tablet!

1066
01:14:16,598 --> 01:14:19,123
- That's what they called you? - It was shorter in Egyptian.

1067
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,929
Great, I'll give you the combination after you give him back.

1068
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:24,062
How dare you? If you touch that again, I shall kill you right now.

1069
01:14:24,139 --> 01:14:25,766
- Okay. - Do not touch this.

1070
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,707
- This is a no-touching zone! - Good. Well, then...

1071
01:14:28,777 --> 01:14:32,804
Oh, my God! I can't believe you reached across like that again!

1072
01:14:32,881 --> 01:14:36,317
I can't even believe it! Oh, God, I want to kill you right...

1073
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:40,115
If you didn't know this combination, you'd be so dead right now,

1074
01:14:40,188 --> 01:14:43,180
- it would be unbelievable. - Great, but I do know the combination.

1075
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:47,350
Don't cross this line with your hand!

1076
01:14:47,462 --> 01:14:53,367
How dare you! If you speak again, I'm going to kill you.

1077
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:54,958
Do you understand this?

1078
01:14:55,036 --> 01:14:56,901
Don't say it! Oh, God, I see you getting ready.

1079
01:14:57,005 --> 01:14:59,132
- I wasn't gonna say anything. - Oh, my God, don't say anything.

1080
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:01,334
I shall murder you if you talk again.

1081
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:06,540
Now give me that tablet and tell me the combination.

1082
01:15:06,815 --> 01:15:09,477
Okay. After you give me Jed and release my friends.

1083
01:15:10,351 --> 01:15:11,750
- You did all three! - What?

1084
01:15:11,853 --> 01:15:13,753
You spoke and you reached your hand across!

1085
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,720
Look. I can talk to you about this all night, okay?

1086
01:15:15,824 --> 01:15:17,189
- How about this? - Look, just give...

1087
01:15:17,258 --> 01:15:19,556
How about I don't kill you right now, like I really, really want to,

1088
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:21,686
and I give you precisely five seconds

1089
01:15:21,763 --> 01:15:24,493
to give me that tablet and tell me the combination?

1090
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:28,161
We already got the combination. It's pi.

1091
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:33,269
- 3.14159265. - No!

1092
01:15:33,374 --> 01:15:35,001
- Hey. - Sorry.

1093
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:41,773
So Crazy Hair here, he sang. Oh, did he sing! Like a canary.

1094
01:15:42,517 --> 01:15:43,950
I'm sorry, Larry.

1095
01:15:44,052 --> 01:15:46,543
Enough out of you! Remember what happened last time?

1096
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:48,445
- That's enough. - Stupid man.

1097
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:53,959
- You okay? - Yeah, thanks.

1098
01:15:54,062 --> 01:15:56,530
Must be a real bummer for you, Larry,

1099
01:15:57,465 --> 01:16:01,526
knowing that all of your valiant efforts were, in the end, for naught.

1100
01:16:02,904 --> 01:16:06,601
What a terrible disappointment you must be to yourself.

1101
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:18,309
Do you hear that humming sound?

1102
01:16:19,921 --> 01:16:21,946
Do you know what that sound is?

1103
01:16:24,058 --> 01:16:25,491
It's rhetorical.

1104
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,789
That is the sound of the End.

1105
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:39,163
I'm sorry, Jed.

1106
01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:41,936
You did your best, Gigantor.

1107
01:16:42,577 --> 01:16:44,841
Dadgum it, we almost had him, too.

1108
01:16:44,946 --> 01:16:48,143
No, I mean, I'm sorry I wasn't around the last couple of years at the museum.

1109
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:52,686
- Maybe none of this would have happened. - You don't get it, do you, Gigantor?

1110
01:16:52,787 --> 01:16:55,187
I didn't call you 'cause we needed your help.

1111
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:56,951
Sure, we were in a little pickle,

1112
01:16:57,025 --> 01:16:58,515
but it wouldn't have been the first time

1113
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:01,254
I had to wrestle my way out of a root sack.

1114
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:05,099
No, partner. I called you 'cause you needed us.

1115
01:17:05,934 --> 01:17:09,301
That fancy suit you've been parading around in these past couple years,

1116
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:11,463
that there's a hanging suit.

1117
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:14,440
All gussied up, but dead inside.

1118
01:17:15,043 --> 01:17:16,374
That ain't you.

1119
01:17:17,278 --> 01:17:19,838
- And I'll tell you another thing. - Yeah.

1120
01:17:19,948 --> 01:17:21,609
This night ain't over yet.

1121
01:17:22,317 --> 01:17:25,480
This little Midnight Cowboy's got some fight left in him.

1122
01:17:25,553 --> 01:17:28,716
Something tells me you do, too. Ho, now!

1123
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:02,486
Welcome to the new, extended reign of Kahmunrah,

1124
01:18:02,557 --> 01:18:04,354
Fifth King of Egypt

1125
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:07,189
and now the world!

1126
01:18:07,762 --> 01:18:11,163
Horus, Ra, my warriors, come forth!

1127
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:16,603
Send Larry Daley and his friends to their doom!

1128
01:18:41,429 --> 01:18:43,056
Halt!

1129
01:18:44,065 --> 01:18:46,932
The mighty Octavius has returned!

1130
01:18:47,035 --> 01:18:52,439
I ride on the back of nature's most fearsome creature! I ride

1131
01:18:53,441 --> 01:18:56,740
the squirrel!

1132
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:02,406
Forward now, my mighty steed!

1133
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,621
Whoa, girl! Easy.

1134
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:10,884
Do you wish to surrender honorably?

1135
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:14,223
Or must this end with the spilling of your blood?

1136
01:19:16,397 --> 01:19:19,025
This? This is your big rescue?

1137
01:19:19,934 --> 01:19:22,903
Oh, no. This is!

1138
01:19:34,315 --> 01:19:36,943
What is that thing?

1139
01:19:37,018 --> 01:19:39,145
The name is Abraham Lincoln.

1140
01:19:39,253 --> 01:19:42,689
- And you, sir, are in a heap of trouble! - Attack it!

1141
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:51,894
Disgusting half-pigeons!

1142
01:20:02,543 --> 01:20:05,011
No, no, no! Hello?

1143
01:20:05,113 --> 01:20:07,445
Adios, bird brains!

1144
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:09,210
Wait, wait, wait. No, no!

1145
01:20:09,317 --> 01:20:11,308
Goodbye, strange birdmen.

1146
01:20:11,452 --> 01:20:13,386
Do not return to the Underworld!

1147
01:20:13,488 --> 01:20:15,479
Yes, yes, do go back into the Underworld!

1148
01:20:15,556 --> 01:20:17,114
Thank you for coming! Good night!

1149
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:18,249
No, no!

1150
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:29,962
Oh, this is awkward.

1151
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:33,068
It appears my work here is done.

1152
01:20:33,641 --> 01:20:39,136
Just remember, son, a house divided against itself cannot stand.

1153
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:42,940
Farewell.

1154
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:47,678
- What now? - You know, I'm not quite sure.

1155
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:52,485
I suppose we should probably start by watching him die.

1156
01:20:53,694 --> 01:20:56,993
Streltsy! Make him dead!

1157
01:21:00,034 --> 01:21:01,831
Now what?

1158
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:07,366
We are not going to attack right

1159
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:10,569
now!

1160
01:21:19,387 --> 01:21:21,184
Get them!

1161
01:21:40,908 --> 01:21:43,570
Fear not, Larry! I will help Jedediah!

1162
01:21:43,644 --> 01:21:45,305
You come at them from behind!

1163
01:21:47,715 --> 01:21:49,615
- Hey, what's going on? - I'm hiding.

1164
01:21:49,717 --> 01:21:51,947
Hiding? What are you doing? Come on, we need you.

1165
01:21:52,453 --> 01:21:56,082
- I'm a failure. - No, you're not.

1166
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,920
Did you foolishly lead 208 Americans to their deaths

1167
01:21:59,026 --> 01:22:00,721
at the Battle of Little Bighorn?

1168
01:22:01,929 --> 01:22:06,366
- No. - No? Not good. Not good at all.

1169
01:22:06,434 --> 01:22:08,868
- That's not good. - Sure, I talk a good game,

1170
01:22:08,936 --> 01:22:11,700
but the truth of the matter is, I don't deserve these stars.

1171
01:22:13,207 --> 01:22:16,540
I will always be famous for my biggest failure.

1172
01:22:19,647 --> 01:22:20,739
Hey.

1173
01:22:21,115 --> 01:22:23,106
The past is the past, okay?

1174
01:22:23,818 --> 01:22:26,548
Right now, this moment, this night,

1175
01:22:28,022 --> 01:22:29,922
this is what you're gonna be remembered for.

1176
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:33,320
This is your last stand.

1177
01:22:51,012 --> 01:22:53,503
- They need a leader. - Yeah, they need a leader.

1178
01:22:55,449 --> 01:22:57,679
Yeah? You want to be their leader, huh?

1179
01:22:58,753 --> 01:23:00,516
- Yeah, I do. - Let's do this!

1180
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:02,281
- All right? - Yeah.

1181
01:23:02,356 --> 01:23:03,721
Let's go!

1182
01:23:06,027 --> 01:23:07,426
Not good!

1183
01:23:07,928 --> 01:23:08,917
Larry!

1184
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:10,756
Hey, Able!

1185
01:23:10,831 --> 01:23:11,820
I want to help!

1186
01:23:11,966 --> 01:23:13,058
Oh, great.

1187
01:23:13,134 --> 01:23:14,829
Who are you? This is my museum!

1188
01:23:15,202 --> 01:23:16,965
Well, he's my human. Back off!

1189
01:23:17,171 --> 01:23:18,729
You need all the help you can get, Jungle-Dweller!

1190
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,329
Get over yourself space snob!

1191
01:23:20,408 --> 01:23:21,432
Guys! Hey, guys!

1192
01:23:21,509 --> 01:23:23,374
This is not the time to get into this, all right?

1193
01:23:25,646 --> 01:23:26,977
Dexter, you know better.

1194
01:23:28,949 --> 01:23:30,814
All right? That's what happens when you do that!

1195
01:23:30,885 --> 01:23:32,216
You get that.

1196
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,792
Stop! Just stop! Stop!

1197
01:23:42,363 --> 01:23:45,355
Now, listen. You're both proud capuchin!

1198
01:23:46,233 --> 01:23:48,030
You need to concentrate on slapping the enemy!

1199
01:23:51,906 --> 01:23:53,203
Keep it together, all right?

1200
01:23:53,307 --> 01:23:55,207
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1201
01:23:57,178 --> 01:24:00,011
- Jedediah! They need us! - I ain't gonna make it!

1202
01:24:00,414 --> 01:24:02,882
Afraid this cowboy's been to his last hoedown.

1203
01:24:03,384 --> 01:24:09,220
Octavius, remember me as I was, wild, and free, and...

1204
01:24:10,491 --> 01:24:13,927
- No need for final words. - I'm not finished yet.

1205
01:24:14,362 --> 01:24:16,125
I want to get to the story of our relationship,

1206
01:24:16,197 --> 01:24:18,495
the evolution from enemy to friends.

1207
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,998
- No! - It'll make you cry!

1208
01:24:21,068 --> 01:24:24,333
No! Because you are going to live!

1209
01:24:35,316 --> 01:24:37,784
- Let's go to work. - Have a sword.

1210
01:24:38,919 --> 01:24:40,352
Sword!

1211
01:24:57,571 --> 01:24:59,232
Incoming!

1212
01:25:18,492 --> 01:25:19,720
That smarts.

1213
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:26,060
You smack, you kick! You smack, you kick!

1214
01:25:26,133 --> 01:25:29,466
You smack, you kick! Teamwork, fellas! Wunderbar!

1215
01:25:33,407 --> 01:25:34,772
How you doing, fellas?

1216
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,669
- Are you all right? - Never better.

1217
01:26:07,775 --> 01:26:09,936
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to open the gate.

1218
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:12,843
- I take it you have a plan. - I'm gonna divide the house.

1219
01:26:17,985 --> 01:26:20,453
The tablet! Now!

1220
01:26:20,521 --> 01:26:21,954
Okay, sure, you can have it.

1221
01:26:22,022 --> 01:26:24,013
Just tell me who the boss is and I'll give it to you.

1222
01:26:24,124 --> 01:26:26,615
Or should I give it to Kahmunrah? He's your master, right?

1223
01:26:26,894 --> 01:26:28,725
Nyet! He is not our master!

1224
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,557
Really? 'Cause he acts like he is.

1225
01:26:30,664 --> 01:26:32,655
But fine, just tell me who the boss is and you can have it.

1226
01:26:32,733 --> 01:26:35,133
Hey! That'd be me.

1227
01:26:36,504 --> 01:26:39,667
This man is a peasant! I am the only one here of noble birth!

1228
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,709
Really? 'Cause he's got more medals and a bigger hat, but...

1229
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,835
- Thank you. - You might got a lot of medals,

1230
01:26:44,912 --> 01:26:47,540
but you put one of your little child hands on that tablet again,

1231
01:26:47,648 --> 01:26:50,481
it'll be the last thing them tiny little mitts of yours ever touch.

1232
01:26:50,551 --> 01:26:52,416
Why would you touch little Nippy?

1233
01:26:54,488 --> 01:26:55,853
I can handle this, okay?

1234
01:26:55,923 --> 01:26:59,017
You can handle nothing! You can barely speak, you fool!

1235
01:26:59,093 --> 01:27:03,029
You know what? No problem. I'll give it to you. You see that?

1236
01:27:06,901 --> 01:27:08,493
Oh, you're a spunky little fella!

1237
01:27:12,706 --> 01:27:18,110
Very clever, Mr. Daley, getting them to fight amongst themselves.

1238
01:27:18,212 --> 01:27:22,012
Yeah. I can't really take credit. It was Abraham Lincoln's idea.

1239
01:27:22,082 --> 01:27:24,448
You know, a house divided can't...

1240
01:27:25,286 --> 01:27:27,277
- Doesn't do well. - Yes, well,

1241
01:27:27,388 --> 01:27:31,085
you should have saved yourself when you had the chance,

1242
01:27:32,693 --> 01:27:34,957
because now I shall have the tremendous pleasure

1243
01:27:35,362 --> 01:27:36,693
of killing you myself!

1244
01:28:27,481 --> 01:28:28,846
What are you?

1245
01:28:31,018 --> 01:28:32,451
I'm the night guard.

1246
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,918
No!

1247
01:28:45,099 --> 01:28:47,033
Victory is ours!

1248
01:28:48,802 --> 01:28:49,962
Yeah!

1249
01:28:55,943 --> 01:28:57,638
That's what I'm talking about!

1250
01:28:57,711 --> 01:28:59,576
Yeah!

1251
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:06,885
I'd say somebody found his moxie.

1252
01:29:08,989 --> 01:29:10,820
The Battle of the Smithsonian.

1253
01:29:12,459 --> 01:29:15,860
Perhaps the greatest battle the world will never know.

1254
01:29:18,232 --> 01:29:19,563
We'll know.

1255
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,562
Yeah.

1256
01:29:26,373 --> 01:29:29,171
Oh, man, I got an hour till sunrise. I got to get you guys back.

1257
01:29:29,243 --> 01:29:33,236
In case you forgot, Gigantor, they don't want us there anymore.

1258
01:29:33,347 --> 01:29:34,712
Well, I do.

1259
01:29:38,385 --> 01:29:41,081
Hey, think you could hook us up with a ride?

1260
01:29:42,389 --> 01:29:44,220
My pleasure, of course.

1261
01:29:45,025 --> 01:29:48,517
Hang on a second. One last thing I got to take care of.

1262
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:52,431
Come on, boy! Come on, come on!

1263
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:54,361
Get in there!

1264
01:29:57,237 --> 01:29:58,670
Feels good, right?

1265
01:30:01,775 --> 01:30:05,677
You're welcome! Just get back inside by sunrise, okay?

1266
01:30:19,426 --> 01:30:22,327
These are promising days, indeed.

1267
01:30:45,486 --> 01:30:47,147
All right. Hey, come on, guys.

1268
01:30:47,254 --> 01:30:50,314
Remember, stay with your buddy, all right?

1269
01:30:50,424 --> 01:30:51,789
Good, good.

1270
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:04,499
Well, you're back where you belong.

1271
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,437
Yeah. Think so.

1272
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:16,739
I guess I should be going.

1273
01:31:19,153 --> 01:31:20,677
Hey, Amelia.

1274
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:25,920
That thing that I was trying to tell you about earlier...

1275
01:31:28,762 --> 01:31:31,253
There's not really an easy way to put this,

1276
01:31:32,332 --> 01:31:36,359
- but, in the morning... - I know what's coming, Mr. Daley.

1277
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,835
I've always known.

1278
01:31:39,606 --> 01:31:41,301
But it doesn't matter.

1279
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:45,334
You've given me the adventure of a lifetime in one night.

1280
01:31:47,481 --> 01:31:50,882
And I have a feeling it's going to be a beautiful sunrise.

1281
01:31:59,226 --> 01:32:00,716
Have fun.

1282
01:32:10,003 --> 01:32:11,334
Thanks.

1283
01:33:02,556 --> 01:33:06,356
I don't know about you fellas, but this old cowboy just got to second base.

1284
01:33:09,263 --> 01:33:11,663
- There she goes. - Straight towards...

1285
01:33:13,233 --> 01:33:14,928
Canada.

1286
01:33:15,936 --> 01:33:17,767
She's heading to Canada.

1287
01:33:20,107 --> 01:33:22,075
No, now she course-corrected.

1288
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,011
Here, head on downstairs, guys.

1289
01:33:28,081 --> 01:33:29,548
- All righty. - Good night, Larry.

1290
01:33:29,616 --> 01:33:31,083
Hey, boy, how's it going?

1291
01:33:32,686 --> 01:33:35,450
Lawrence! Bless you for bringing them back.

1292
01:33:35,555 --> 01:33:38,251
And might I say, a hearty well-done is in order.

1293
01:33:38,358 --> 01:33:41,794
And may I also point out, they cannot hide in the basement forever.

1294
01:33:41,862 --> 01:33:43,489
Yeah. No, I think I got that figured out.

1295
01:33:43,563 --> 01:33:44,689
- Really? - Yeah.

1296
01:33:44,765 --> 01:33:46,562
Sun come, dum-dum.

1297
01:33:47,567 --> 01:33:49,762
Our moai friend is right. The dawn will soon be upon us.

1298
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:51,303
Hey, Teddy.

1299
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:52,861
Remember the other night you were saying something

1300
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:54,237
about the key to happiness?

1301
01:33:54,308 --> 01:33:56,037
- Did I? - You said, "The key to happiness is..."

1302
01:33:56,109 --> 01:33:58,577
And then the sun came up and you froze.

1303
01:33:58,645 --> 01:34:00,408
- I think I got it figured out. - Yes?

1304
01:34:00,914 --> 01:34:04,213
It's doing what you love, isn't it? With people you love.

1305
01:34:06,486 --> 01:34:08,317
Actually, I was going to say "physical exercise",

1306
01:34:08,422 --> 01:34:09,821
but the love thing's good, too.

1307
01:34:15,562 --> 01:34:17,757
- Lawrence! - Yeah.

1308
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,761
Welcome home, son.

1309
01:34:24,137 --> 01:34:25,570
Thanks.

1310
01:34:40,487 --> 01:34:44,116
Well, folks, the wait is over. After two months of renovation,

1311
01:34:44,191 --> 01:34:47,922
tonight, The Museum of Natural History reopens its doors to the public.

1312
01:34:47,995 --> 01:34:50,361
As you can see, New Yorkers are flooding in,

1313
01:34:50,464 --> 01:34:52,989
eager to see just what changes are in store.

1314
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,829
With its new, extended night hours,

1315
01:34:54,935 --> 01:34:57,631
we're told the museum will be more lively than ever.

1316
01:35:11,718 --> 01:35:14,346
I see the uniform still fits after these long, long years.

1317
01:35:14,454 --> 01:35:16,820
Yeah, yeah. Really hasn't been that long, but...

1318
01:35:17,724 --> 01:35:21,683
So, to what do we owe this "triumphant" return?

1319
01:35:21,795 --> 01:35:25,231
Not cut out for the "corporate" jungle after all. Got fired.

1320
01:35:27,034 --> 01:35:30,003
No, actually, I sold my company.

1321
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:33,039
The world doth move in mysterious ways.

1322
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,973
One day, we've got to get rid of everything old,

1323
01:35:36,043 --> 01:35:42,073
the next, a rich, anonymous donor gives a huge endowment.

1324
01:35:42,182 --> 01:35:46,141
With a proviso: Everything stays the same. So...

1325
01:35:50,824 --> 01:35:53,190
- Well, not exactly the same, obviously. - No.

1326
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:56,195
Bully, lads and ladies, the name is Theodore Roosevelt,

1327
01:35:56,263 --> 01:36:01,098
naturalist, Rough Rider and twenty-sixth President of these great United States.

1328
01:36:01,201 --> 01:36:04,693
Come along, lad. The hunt is afoot. Lawrence.

1329
01:36:10,243 --> 01:36:13,110
Hey, you dum-dums bring me gum-gum?

1330
01:36:20,954 --> 01:36:24,287
My parents gave me this tablet some 3,000 years ago,

1331
01:36:24,391 --> 01:36:28,555
entrusting me with one of my people's most prized possessions.

1332
01:36:28,628 --> 01:36:31,461
- Does it do anything? - Do anything?

1333
01:36:31,565 --> 01:36:33,590
Yeah. What's the point if it doesn't do anything?

1334
01:36:34,734 --> 01:36:35,826
Tell 'em

1335
01:36:35,902 --> 01:36:38,166
Actually, it has a magical power

1336
01:36:38,166 --> 01:36:40,430
that brings all the exhibits to life.

1337
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:41,973
No, really, what's it do?

1338
01:36:43,643 --> 01:36:46,134
Nothing. It's just for decoration.

1339
01:36:46,246 --> 01:36:47,577
I knew it.

1340
01:36:48,748 --> 01:36:52,616
This place is lame. This thing doesn't even look real.

1341
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:55,813
Seriously, dude, these animatronics suck.

1342
01:37:05,298 --> 01:37:06,731
- Mammoth? - Yeah.

1343
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,233
Extinct!

1344
01:37:08,602 --> 01:37:10,968
- Today's technology is beyond me. - I know. It's so lifelike.

1345
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:13,005
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Something else.

1346
01:37:13,406 --> 01:37:15,237
You'll stick around a bit longer this time,

1347
01:37:15,308 --> 01:37:17,970
or you gonna run away again when you get something better?

1348
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:20,512
- I'm gonna stay. - Stay, for a long time.

1349
01:37:20,614 --> 01:37:21,808
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1350
01:37:22,449 --> 01:37:27,978
Good. 'Cause, as night guards go, you're...

1351
01:37:28,822 --> 01:37:31,086
- What? - The best.

1352
01:37:32,325 --> 01:37:33,917
Excuse me.

1353
01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:41,496
You, the toddler! Don't hug the displays.

1354
01:38:18,205 --> 01:38:19,263
I'm sorry. Hi.

1355
01:38:19,339 --> 01:38:21,330
I don't mean to stare. I just...

1356
01:38:21,675 --> 01:38:24,872
You look a lot like somebody I know, and...

1357
01:38:25,645 --> 01:38:27,044
I get that a lot.

1358
01:38:27,147 --> 01:38:30,674
- Do you? - Yeah. I guess I have that kind of face.

1359
01:38:31,384 --> 01:38:33,079
- Familiar. - Yeah.

1360
01:38:34,154 --> 01:38:37,146
You're not by any chance related to Amelia Earhart, are you?

1361
01:38:37,924 --> 01:38:39,323
- No. - No.

1362
01:38:39,392 --> 01:38:41,383
- No, I don't think so. - Of course you're not.

1363
01:38:41,494 --> 01:38:43,462
I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm...

1364
01:38:43,462 --> 01:38:45,430
I just had to ask. I'm sorry.

1365
01:38:46,032 --> 01:38:49,524
She was that woman who flew across the Pacific.

1366
01:38:49,603 --> 01:38:51,434
- The Atlantic. - Atlantic. Of course.

1367
01:38:51,538 --> 01:38:54,029
First woman to fly across the Atlantic, and she received the Flying Cross,

1368
01:38:54,107 --> 01:38:55,699
first woman to do that.

1369
01:38:56,443 --> 01:38:59,606
- That's very cool. - Yeah, she was cool.

1370
01:39:07,053 --> 01:39:10,614
Hey, you know what you should check out is the the Hall of Miniatures.

1371
01:39:12,292 --> 01:39:14,852
Could you take me there? I'm always getting lost.

1372
01:39:17,297 --> 01:39:21,256
Yeah, I know. Sure. Yeah, I'll show you. Come on.

1373
01:39:21,901 --> 01:39:23,425
Thank you.

1374
01:39:23,937 --> 01:39:26,098
- I'm Larry Daley. - Tess.

1375
01:40:01,174 --> 01:40:04,234
- Joseph, time for dinner! - One second, Ma!

1376
01:40:04,311 --> 01:40:08,509
Joey Motorola, you get down here for supper right now!

1377
01:40:08,615 --> 01:40:12,107
I said one second, Ma! I really think I'm on to something here!
