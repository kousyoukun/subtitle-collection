1
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,092
让我去,
一下子就好
Let me go, just for a minute.

2
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,186
你要看着宝宝
直到她睡着
You're going to stare that baby
into a coma.

3
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,311
别这么夸张
Stop exaggerating.

4
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:28,728
每五分钟过来看一次对宝宝不好
想想,有可能发生什么可怕的事情
It's not good to keep checking
and imagining terrible things.

5
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:33,363
我知道,我知道
这里开始来吧
- I know, I know.
- Here it starts. Here we go.

6
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:36,652
拉迪亚德--
拉迪亚德,她没有呼吸
Rudyard...
Rudyard, she's not breathing.

7
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:39,828
亲爱的,她正在睡觉呢
宝宝正在睡觉
Honey, she's sleeping.
The baby's sleeping.

8
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,325
不
No...

9
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,993
拉迪亚德,宝宝死了
他在睡觉
- Rudyard, it's crib death.
- It's sleep!

10
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,372
她睡熟了,亲爱的
也许
- She's asleep, honey.
- Maybe.

11
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,624
快点
Come on!

12
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,683
艾玛
Emma.

13
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,259
哦,好的
Oh, good.

14
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,223
这还不错
That's better.

15
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:15,244
《母女情深》


16
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,923
不,谢谢
No, thank you.

17
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,519
谢谢
艾玛?
Thanks. Emma?

18
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:50,558
哦, 他是曾经为我工作的人中
最值得信任的一个人
He was one of the most dependable men
that ever worked for me.

19
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:54,151
我知道 谢谢你
他是个好人
- I know. Thank you.
- He was a good man.

20
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:03,866
对你父亲的事情我感到很遗憾
照顾好你妈妈
I'm real sorry about your daddy.
Take care of your momma.

21
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,959
艾玛
艾玛,醒来,快点
Emma? Emma, wake up, please.

22
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,719
醒来
怎么了？
- Wake up.
- What's wrong?

23
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:03,797
我很紧张而且我很好奇,
你觉得怎么样？
I was tense and I was wondering
how you were feeling.

24
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:07,841
你喜欢在我的床上睡觉吗?
不,谢谢
- Would you like to sleep in my bed?
- No, thank you.

25
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,143
你又想在我床上睡觉？
Would you like to sleep
in my bed again?

26
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,643
是的!
Yes!

27
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,678
我们做什么好?
玩头发？
What are we going to do
with this hair?

28
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,717
嗨,艾玛!
Hey, Emma!

29
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,308
佩特西,快点!
你会想他的
Patsy, hurry up!
You're going to miss him.

30
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,689
哦,他们在看什么？
Oh, that's what they were looking at!

31
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,200
晚安,亲爱的
妈妈在哪里?
- Good night, honey.
- Where's Momma?

32
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,957
谁会稀罕要
她用过的东西!
That old fart's trying
to get in her pants.

33
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,169
那宇航员怎样了?
哦,他们在休斯敦找了一处落脚的地方
- What if the astronaut shows up?
- Oh, they're everywhere in Houston!

34
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:18,714
跟瑞思打个招呼
爱你
宇航员!
- Say hi to Race.
- OK. Love ya. Astronauts!

35
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,842
怎么了？
So?

36
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,427
我们最好走,我要跟我妈
说声再见,你要跟着一起去？
- We better get going.
- I'll say goodbye. Want to go with?

37
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,224
不,我觉得不行,今天不行
No. I don't think I'm up to it today.

38
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,442
有一个那样的母亲一定很不错
Sure would be nice
to have a mother somebody liked.

39
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:52,040
你为什么不面对现实呢？
你有一定的生理需要
Why don't you accept the fact that
you have certain biological needs?

40
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,160
因为我没有
妈妈! 我现在就去
- Because I don't.
- Mom! I'm going now.

41
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,714
对不起
Excuse me.

42
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,757
你能相信吗?
他想要带我到大溪地岛
Can you believe it?
He wants to take me to Tahiti.

43
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:14,098
我不知道为什么你这样对待这些男人
他们也有感觉的
I don't know why you treat these men
like this. They have feelings too.

44
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,106
宇航员搬进来了吗?
谁？
- Has the astronaut moved in yet?
- Who?

45
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,809
谁？佩特西没有教你关于如何卖弄风骚么？
是布莱得拉夫搬进来
他搬进来了吗?
Patsy teaching you coy lessons?
Breedlove. Has he moved in?

46
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,403
穿上你的袜子!
跟佩特西说再见
- Put your socks up!
- Say goodbye to Patsy.

47
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,159
在11:00之前回家
跟佩特西说再见
- Be home by eleven.
- Say goodbye to Patsy.

48
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,948
再见,佩特西
谢谢
再见,格林威太太
- Goodbye, Patsy!
- Thank you.

00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,829
我觉得听玛丽马丁的歌够傻的
I feel really foolish getting stoned
to hear Mary Martin.

60
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,833
看,佩特西
See, Patsy...

61
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,130
这是玛丽马--这不是玛丽马丁,
这是 埃塞尔 默尔曼
This is not Mary Martin,
this is Ethel Merman.

62
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,720
这将是我们最后一次这样子
This is the last time
we're gonna be like this.

63
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,353
我只是简单的拒绝
进入那种思考
I just plain refuse
to get into that kind of thinking.

64
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,278
不应该停止
It should not stop.

65
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,486
我的意思是,我们将会是最好的朋友
I mean, we're gonna be best friends.

66
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,064
我们的宝宝将会是最好的朋友

67
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,531
我们全部将会是最好的朋友

68
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,239
哦,上帝!
Oh, God!

69
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,489
等一下
打开门
- Just a minute.
- Open the door.

70
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,910
艾玛,打开门
Emma, open the door.

71
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,414
等一下
Just a minute.

72
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,004
我需要和你说话!
好的
- I need to talk to you!
- All right.

73
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,093
我要结婚了
这算他妈的什么？
I'm getting married. What the hell?

74
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,550
在我的房间见我？
是的
- Meet me in my room?
- Yes.

75
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:23,974
你认为她想要什么?
也许她正想告诉你该如何做爱
- What do you think she wants?
- Maybe to tell you how to have sex.

76
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:28,196
什么?!
不,她只知道该如何避免它
What?! No. She only knows
how to avoid it.

77
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,691
我不能相信你说了那个
I can't believe you said that.

78
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,656
我不是故意的
我发誓
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it, I swear.

79
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,964
你刚才干什么呢？
艾玛
What have you been doing, Emma?

80
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,919
什么都没干
Nothing.

81
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,504
怎么了? 妈妈
What is it, Momma?

82
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,473
我真的想好好睡一会儿
所以我明天会看来挺不错的
I really want to get some sleep so
I look halfway decent for tomorrow.

83
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,520
快点
什么事啊？
Come on. What is it?

84
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:09,194
你想让我对某事沉默
就是为了你自己？
Would you want me to be silent
about something for your own good?

85
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,319
是的,妈妈, 我会
Yes, ma'am, I would!

86
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,665
好吧,来
OK, come on.

87
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,676
来
Come on.

88
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,197
我在这里呆了一整晚了
I've been in here all night.

89
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:58,490
我已经尝试决定
给你买什么结婚礼物
I've been trying to decide what...
what wedding gift to get you.

90
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,915
我想到母亲给我
的雷诺瓦(少女的画像)
I thought of that Renoir
that my mother gave me.

91
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,251
但是我无法得出一个结论
But I couldn't reach a conclusion.

92
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,920
然后我想找到一个理由
为什么我无法静下心来考虑你的结婚礼物
Then I came to grips with the reason
why I couldn't think of a gift.

93
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:21,347
哦,妈妈,没关系的
我需要盘子,一个烤肉馆,
Oh, Momma, it's all right.
I need dishes, a rotisserie...

94
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,475
汽车,一楝房子
The car... the house...

95
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:30,021
艾玛,确信
如果你明天就跟佛莱普 霍顿结婚
I'm totally convinced
if you marry Flap Horton tomorrow,

96
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,147
这将会是一个巨大的错误
it will be a mistake
of such gigantic proportions,

97
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,023
它将会毁灭你的生活
和你可怜的命运
it will ruin your life
and make wretched your destiny.

98
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,152
你为什么这么对我
Why are you doing this to me?

99
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,491
你还不能够
克服差劲的婚姻
You are not special enough
to overcome a bad marriage.

100
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,129
艾玛,动动脑子
Use your brains.

101
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,466
佛莱普他目光短浅
他没有想像力
Flap is limited.
He hasn't got any imagination.

102
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,088
就算是现在他所想要得到的只是
一个稳定的教学工作而已
Even at this age, all he wants
is a secure teaching job.

103
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,592
妈妈
Mother...

104
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,637
我明天就跟佛莱普结婚
I'm marrying Flap Horton tomorrow.

105
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,432
我感谢上帝,
佛莱普可以带我离开这里
I thank God
Flap's getting me out of here.

106
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,769
如果这是你的态度,
不要来参加我的婚礼
If this is your attitude,
don't come to my wedding.

107
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,815
那-- 那好吧
That's right.

108
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,072
不, 我想你是正确的
No, I think you're right.

109
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,281
我也比较讨厌装样子
The hypocrisy was bothering me, too.

110
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,467
我自己的母亲不来参加我的婚礼
My own mother's
not coming to my wedding.

111
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,949
听她的电话
她正在发狂
Listen to her. She's going crazy.

112
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,533
我会在明天中午之前给她
I'll give her until noon tomorrow.

113
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,376
艾玛,你的妈妈
反对了你的婚礼,
Emma, your mother
boycotted your wedding,

114
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,759
她讨厌你的丈夫,
而且她只是半尊敬的态度
she hates your husband
and only holds you in medium esteem.

115
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,137
半尊敬
Medium esteem.

116
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,599
真可爱
真可爱
That is so cute. That is so cute.

117
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:34,066
这不是很奇怪的吗
如果我们的其中之一嫁了一个不识字的人
Wouldn't it have been strange
to marry a person who didn't read?

118
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,402
有数百万有趣的人
从不拾起一本书
There's millions of interesting
people who never pick up a book.

119
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:50,702
佛莱普,我对我们之间的感觉非常好
我希望我今晚会怀孕
Flap, I feel so totally good about
us. I hope I get pregnant tonight.

120
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,165
那会很美好
That would be nice.

121
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,261
我喜欢你看我的样子
I love the way you look.

122
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,517
你是--你是如此美好
You're so nice.

123
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,527
我是--你是我的小甜点
I... You're my sweet-assed gal.

124
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,316
新娘来了
Here comes the bride!

125
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,360
∮ [西方故事“ 古奇长官 ”]∮
Wait, Flap. Where did you learn
how to do that?

126
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,752
那是做爱的时候听到
的最奇怪的音乐
That is the strangest
music to make love to.

127
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,665
我知道
I know.

128
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,267
别管我。我很快乐
我不想和你说话
Leave me alone. I'm happy.
I don't want to talk to you.

129
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,566
不。你见到罗西给我的桌巾吗？
No. Did you see the tablecloth
Rosie gave me?

130
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,937
很漂亮的,
上面有红色花的
It's beautiful.
It's got red flowers on it.

131
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,109
她做的
不,还没有
She made it. No, not yet.

132
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,992
秘制煎蛋饼,我们准备开始了
典型的墨西哥风格
Home-made omelettes.
Just ordered 'em. Kinda Tex-Mex.

133
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,576
不。那是你对我做过的
最坏的事情了,妈妈
No. That was the worst thing
you've ever done to me, Mother!

134
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,995
我觉得你欠我丈夫一次道歉
Well, I think you owe my husband
an apology.

135
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,707
直到你道歉
我不听你的废话
Until you apologise,
I'm not listening to your gossip.

136
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,252
不。好吧,他就在这里
No. Well, he's right here.

137
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,429
稍等
Hold on.

138
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,642
是的 是的
Yes. Yes.

139
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,016
哈罗,格林威太太
Hello, Mrs Greenway.

140
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,194
不,妈妈, 我对你当前
的状态并不很高兴
No, ma'am, I am not
enjoying your predicament.

141
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,443
妈妈,不错啊!
Momma, be nice!

142
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:30,442
事实上,我不需要道歉
As a matter of fact,
I don't need or desire an apology.

143
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:35,372
我想要的只是让你明白
赞同我所处的位置,
All I want is for you to understand
and appreciate my position,

144
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,249
尊重我们的婚姻
to respect our marriage,

145
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:44,212
还有，你在早上想打电话前，推迟15分钟再打来
and to wait another 15 minutes
before you call in the morning.

146
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,299
是的,
我想我已经说了我所要说的了
Yes, I guess I've said my piece.

147
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,011
好 我把电话给她
OK, I'll put her on.

148
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,101
他真的很棒!
我稍后再和你说
He's so great!
I'll talk to you later.

149
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,106
我不关心邻里关系
I don't care about the neighbourhood.

150
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,067
你不能再多呆一会儿么？
Can't you stay a little while longer?

151
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:14,993
我觉得我们相处
的相当不错的
I thought we were having
a real good time, didn't you?

152
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,536
听我说,先不要走
Listen, don't go yet.

153
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:22,334
多呆一会儿
我有东西给你看
One more minute.
I've got something to show you.

154
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,248
不,真的
No, really.

155
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,055
谢谢
晚安
- Thanks.
- Good night.

156
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,204
我给你买了个东西
什么?
- I bought you something.
- What?

157
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,244
领带
A tie.

158
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,091
你不是为了我而买的领带
You didn't buy this for me.

159
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,512
你担心我如何看待你的母亲
You were worried about
how I'd look to your mother.

160
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,386
不要做一个她认为的逆子
Stop being a quisling
where she is concerned.

161
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,967
为什么我高兴
的时候你都说反话？
Whenever I get happy,
you turn perverse.

162
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,308
买这个使你快乐?
是的是的!
- Buying this tie made you happy?!
- Yes! Yes!

163
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,817
我希望你可以理解
因为你真的不理解
I wish you could understand,
cos you really don't.

164
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,071
买了这条领带真的让我很开心
It made me very happy,
buying this tie.

165
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,945
我转了两三个地方才买到的
I went to two or three places.

166
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:40,659
然后对售货员描述你的夹克
然后才明白,这跟你的衣服是多么般配
Then describing your jacket, knowing
it would match what you're wearing,

167
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,699
确实很般配
which, by the way, it certainly does.

168
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,918
我的意思是,这很可笑!
I mean, it was fun!

169
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,627
这是他妈的狂欢节日!
你太死板了,竟然无法理解这种快乐
It was a goddamn mardi gras and
you're too dumb to understand that!

170
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,176
对不起,
我表现的太可怕了
I'm sorry. I'm being terrible.

171
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:59,048
去找你的母亲
我刚才有点不理智
Going to your mother's,
it makes me a little irrational.

172
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,059
我能帮助你吗?
Can I help?

173
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,525
是的 谢谢你,佛莱普
Yes. Thank you, Flap.

174
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,860
拿着这个蜡烛,
我需要多一根
Take this candle. I need another one.

175
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,023
在厨房中?
是的
- In the kitchen?
- Yes.

176
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,155
那看起来很棒
That looks great.

177
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,832
那一个矮绅士是谁?
Who's that short gentleman?

178
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:32,465
那个跟你一点关系都没有
别管他了
Not that it's any of your business...
Just leave it at that.

179
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,522
你在看什么?
她不在那里了
What are you looking at?
She isn't there any more.

180
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,650
她会回来的
She'll be back.

181
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,904
我是爱德华詹森,
奥罗拉的朋友
I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend.

182
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,035
很高兴遇见你
佛农 德拉特
Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart.

183
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,865
上帝呀,她不来了吗?
她来了
God, isn't she something?
Here she comes.

184
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,327
我两周前在教堂看见她了
I met her two weeks ago at church.

185
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,583
你可能说,她是上帝给予
佛农 德拉特的礼物
You might say she's God's gift
to Vernon Dahlart.

186
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,344
你喜欢她?
Then you like her?

187
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,594
哦, 不,很明显吗
Oh, no. Does it show?

188
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,010
好吃
Good food.

189
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:28,189
当我住在波士顿的时候
我做过服务员供应这个
Well, this is what I used to serve
when I lived in Boston.

190
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,356
佛农你什么都没说
Vernon, you haven't said a word.

191
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,062
有什么问题么？
我感觉起来好像我没有停止过讲话
Is that right? I feel like
I haven't stopped talking.

192
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:39,865
我猜可能是因为我太想你了
I guess because
I've been thinking about you so much.

193
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,452
我可以告诉你怎么对付我么？
Can I suggest how to handle me?

194
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,448
是的,妈妈
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,211
在我没到这个地位
的时候不要崇拜我
Don't worship me
until I've earned it.

196
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,671
谢谢你,妈妈
我很感激你给我的任何忠告
Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate
any advice you can give me.

197
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,508
佛恩在你吃东西
的时候不要讲话
Don't talk
with your mouth full, Vernon.

198
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,130
我不做那种事情
I wouldn't do that.

199
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:05,261
我刚刚做是想让你笑
I just did it to make you laugh.

200
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,306
你怎么了?
What's wrong with you?

201
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,476
我得到了一些好消息
I got some good news.

202
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,727
那是什么?
What's that?

203
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,691
我怀孕了,但不确定
I'm unofficially pregnant.

204
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:22,325
我们还没有拿到测试结果
但是你知道我,我从不迟到
We haven't gotten the tests back yet,
but you know me, I'm never late.

205
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,993
好啊
Well...

206
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,120
不过我还是不了解
I don't understand.

207
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:36,249
呃,如果你对我并不开心
你不开心我会发疯的
If you're not happy for me,
I'll get so mad if you're not happy.

208
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,639
为什么我应该--
作为一个祖母,我为什么应该感到开心？
Why should I be happy
about being a grandmother?

209
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,184
这是不是意味着你
不会给婴儿织什么衣服的
Does this mean you won't be
knitting any booties?

210
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,355
佛莱普
Flap...

211
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:03,233
每一次你拿超过二种饮料
你面对我
Every time you get more than
two drinks in you, you confront me.

212
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,320
我拿不到它
And I won't have it.

213
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,663
我拿不到它
不是在这栋房子里
对不起
I won't have it,
not in this house. Excuse me.

214
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,101
你需要帮忙吗?
Do you need some help?

215
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:40,400
不,我很好
只要我伸开我的腿
No. I'll be fine
just as soon as I stretch my legs.

216
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,234
哦,上帝
Oh, God.

217
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,407
布莱得拉夫 先生
Mr Breedlove.

218
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,660
你流血了
You're bleeding.

219
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,038
是的
Yeah.

220
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,047
没关系
It's OK.

221
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,755
进来
Come on in.

222
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,674
不,谢谢你
No, thank you.

223
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,593
你害怕什么?
What are you afraid of?

224
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,179
害怕?
Afraid?

225
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,096
好吧
Well...

226
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,145
为什么不？
Why not...?

227
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,643
为什么不过来？-
Why not come on in?

228
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,023
因为你大大超出了
我可以约会的年龄
Because you're much older
than the boys I date,

229
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,155
因为你喝醉了
cos you're drunk,

230
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:30,367
而且因为当我去看宇航员
正在演讲的时候
and because when I went to see
an astronaut give a lecture,

231
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,540
我并不指望他追我们
I didn't expect him
to prowl after us all night.

232
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,920
我也不期待那些愚蠢的卖弄风骚的人
敞开着他们的夹克
I didn't expect some silly flirt
who had to keep his jacket open

233
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,247
因为他们大腹便便
because his belly's getting too big.

234
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,300
我在等待一个英雄
I expected a hero.

235
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,564
好吧,好, 桃瑞丝, 别进来
Well, OK, Doris, don't come in.

236
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,897
我不想让你进我的房子
I don't want you in my house.

237
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,365
李安妮, 你要不要进来？
Lee Anne, would you like to come in?

238
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,861
你最好向后转
You better tend to that cut.

239
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,931
汤米,让我看看你的肚子
快点
Tommy, show me your belly.
Come on. Come on!

240
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,183
你怎么能那么打扮他？
他多可爱啊,看看他
- How can you dress him like that?
- He's adorable. Look at him.

241
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,733
哦,太棒了,汤米
Oh, great, Tommy.

242
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,325
是佛农,告诉他我,阿
That's Vernon. So tell him I'm...

243
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,996
在外面?
不,告诉他我正在休息
- Out?
- No. Tell him I'm resting.

244
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,460
哈罗
Hello?

245
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,584
嗨,佛莱普
Hi, Flap.

246
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,214
哪里?不,现在告诉我,
我现在就要知道
Where? No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.

247
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,759
哦,佛莱普,你以为我不会快乐
Oh, Flap, you did not
expect I'd be happy.

248
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,555
让我们坦诚相待
在我们开始假装之前
Let's be honest with each other
before we start pretending.

249
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,729
呃,知道么,妈妈在盯着我呢
Look, Mom's staring at me right now,

250
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:30,033
可不可以稍后再跟你谈这个？
so can I talk about it later to you?

251
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,362
是的
Yeah.

252
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,279
好的
All right.

253
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,778
再见
Bye.

254
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,467
你要保守这个秘密多久？
How long you going to
keep this a secret?

255
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:53,970
唯一的接受佛莱普
助理教授职位的学校
The only school that would accept
his associate professorship

256
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,216
在得梅因(美国衣阿华州的首府)
is in Des Moines.

257
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,437
他什么都做不了
就像内部考试不及格
He can't even do the simple things,
like fail locally.

258
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,399
会好起来的,妈妈
It's gonna be all right, Momma.

259
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,645
是得梅因
It's Des Moines.

260
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,650
说“再见,我的家”
再见,我的家
- Say, "Bye-bye, house".
- Bye-bye, house.

261
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,457
下楼梯的时候小心点
别摔到你的腿
Be careful going down these steps.
Don't break your leg.

262
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,760
来这里
Come here.

263
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,929
来这里
来这里
Come here. Come here.

264
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,971
保持你的甜美笑容,亲爱的
Stay sweet, honey.

265
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,688
罗西--
Rosie...

266
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:47,067
啊,够了,罗西
他们该走了
That's enough, Rosie.
They have to get started.

267
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:52,157
你工作晚了就叫妈妈
开车送你回家。找些乐子,罗西
Tell Momma to drive you home when
you work late. Have some fun, Rosie.

268
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:56,025
不要表现得这么勇敢
我知道没有我在旁边唠叨
你就会发疯的
Don't act so brave. I know you'll go
crazy without me to nag.

269
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,409
对她好点,否则我们对你不客气
Be good to her or else we'll get you.

270
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,166
我说正经的
I mean it.

271
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,667
再见,佛莱普
一路顺风
Bye, Flap. Have a good drive.

272
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,099
好, 把手脚都收回来
拿着妈妈的钱包
OK, fingers and toes in.
Take Momma's purse.

273
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:35,108
妈妈,那是第一次
我首先停止拥抱
Momma, that's the first time
I stopped hugging first.

274
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,277
我喜欢那样
I like that.

275
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,415
自己找一个合适
得体的孕妇装
Get yourself a decent
maternity dress.

276
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,369
必须要一个,不是吗?
You had to get one in, didn't you?

277
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:50,045
你告诉她了么？佩特西？
她一直认为是我
Will you tell her, Patsy?
She keeps thinking it's me.

278
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:56,967
汤姆,你会不会对你的妈妈很好
而且一直照顾她?
Tom... Are you gonna be good
to your mother and take care of her?

279
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,134
再见,格林威太太
Bye, Mrs Greenway.

280
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,886
再见
Goodbye.

281
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,560
到了那里给我写信,
这样我就知道你的住址了
Write as soon as you get there,
so I'll have your address, OK?

282
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,020
祝你一切顺利,佩特西
You shape up, Patsy.

283
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,978
啊!我掉了我的口香糖
Dropped my gum.

284
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,526
我们会拿另外的一块给你
We'll get you another piece,
sweetheart.

285
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:22,572
电话费将会很惊人的,
你知道么？
The phone bill will be enormous,
you know that?

286
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,286
我将会想你的,妈妈
I'll miss you, Momma.

287
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,048
我们能现在走了吗?
是的,慢慢地开走
- Can we go now?
- Yeah. Pull away slow.

288
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:16,213
亲爱的,离开你的
Honey, I think it will be good for us
to be away from your...

289
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,926
我们的家庭
这将对我们有好处的
Our families.

290
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:22,425
我想念休斯顿
你不知道你是多么的幸运
- I miss Houston.
- You don't know how lucky you are.

291
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,054
每个人都想要去得梅因
Everybody wants to go to Des Moines.

292
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,517
人们在他们死之前
People come from all over the world

293
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:31,476
想要去得梅因看一眼
to get one look at Des Moines
before they die.

294
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,817
人们说它是在
爱荷华州最好的城市
Some people say
it's the best city in lowa.

295
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,650
知道你正在蒙我
德克萨斯才是最好的!
I know you're teasing me.
Texas is the best!

296
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:43,239
我觉得你应该停止烦恼
Well, I think
you should stop worrying.

297
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,828
我们将会见到一些新事物
我们都是
We're gonna see
some terrific new things. We are.

298
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:13,816
请,如果你愿意
能不能小点声？
Would you please, if you will,
hold it down over there?

299
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,941
对不起, 我听不到你说话
Sorry, I can't hear you.

300
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,943
小点声!
对他人的感觉尊重一些
Hold it down! Have some respect
for other people's feelings!

301
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,404
靠近一些
Come over a little closer.

302
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:26,443
嗨, 在矮树丛里面的,
我听不到你说话 -
Hey, you in the bush,
I can't hear you!

303
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,298
不好意思,我洗了一个桑拿
Sorry, but I just took a sauna.

304
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:50,010
当你淋冷水的时候
很难忍着不叫
It's hard not to yell when you hit
that cold water.

305
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:54,054
我说话的时候你不理我？
You're not gonna ignore me
when I speak directly to you?

306
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,566
我不是不理你
那我应该说什么？
I'm not ignoring you.
What am I supposed to say?

307
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:01,105
当你淋冷水的时候
很难忍着不叫
OK, It's hard not to yell
when you hit that cold water.

308
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,524
嗨,哎,来这里
Hey, come here.

309
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,577
来这里?
Come here?

310
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,121
你叫什么?
What is your name?

311
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,497
奥罗拉?
是的
- Aurora?
- Yes.

312
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,328
你-你想吃一惊么？
You want a shock?

313
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,673
不,一点也不
什么?
No, not especially. What?

314
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:29,892
好吧,我们将要
在啊--
Well... We're going to have
this dinner at...

315
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,200
在白宫的美国航空
暨太空总署吃晚餐
a NASA dinner at the White House.

316
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:36,705
你知道,一些苏联宇航员,
和我们全部--
You know, some cosmonauts
and all of us, and...

317
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:39,241
我不知道应该带谁去
I didn't know who I could take.

318
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,781
所有和我一起飞的人
Cos all the people I flew with,

319
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:47,615
他们的老婆都像
母狗一样咬我的后背
well, their wives are giving me
bitch bites all over my back

320
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,075
如果我跟其中一个女人出现
if I showed up
with my regular girls.

321
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:53,367
我不认识什么熟人
因此我想,
I didn't know anybody old enough,
so I thought,

322
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,246
“嗯,我去问问隔壁的邻居”
"Well, I'll ask
my next-door neighbour."

323
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,088
好吧,无论如何,
他们取消了今天晚餐,
Well, anyway,
they cancelled the dinner,

324
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:07,218
但是我真的想约你出去
but I was really thinking
about asking you out.

325
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,976
我是认真的
不觉得吃惊么？
Seriously. Ain't that a shocker?

326
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,638
是的
Yes.

327
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:19,143
想像你跟一个人约好了
而且并不是特别的重要的
Imagine you having a date with
someone where it wasn't a felony.

328
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,319
这时候如果我也邀请你,
你怎么办？
What would you have said
if I'd asked you?

329
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,279
认真的
Seriously.

330
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:36,000
我会说我想去看看白宫
I would have said I'd like to see
the White House.

331
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,576
所以你会来
So you would have come?

332
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:45,132
怎么搞的？
找个时间约出来吃顿饭？
What the hell. You want to have
dinner out some time?

333
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:48,090
不,谢谢你
午餐怎么样?
- No, thank you.
- What about lunch?

334
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,799
你是淑女,
你应该非常喜欢吃午餐
You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot, don't you?

335
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:55,475
你知道啦,
你的行为举止有些问题
You know, there's something
about your manner.

336
00:30:55,563 --> 00:31:00,521
好像你正打算玩弄我
It's like you're trying
to toy with me.

337
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,739
没错,奥罗拉,
我是在和你玩
That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.

338
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,823
这是一方面
你想要玩吗,奥罗拉?
- This is exactly...
- Do you want to play, Aurora?

339
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,158
你想吃午餐吗?
You wanna go to lunch,

340
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,653
我们会吃午餐的
we'll have lunch.

341
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,412
如果你想去餐馆吃午餐
If you want to have lunch
in some restaurant

342
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:22,666
来改善邻里关系
我会坚定地说不
to improve the atmosphere in this
neighbourhood, I wouldn't say no.

343
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:27,460
过来
我们说话的距离太远了
Come here.
We're too far apart to talk.

344
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,730
现在
奥罗拉
Now... Aurora.

345
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:48,073
因为你已经同意
Since you've agreed,

346
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,406
为什么我们不忘记其他的
why don't we just
forget about the rest?

347
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:56,322
我的意思是,
我知道你的感受
I mean, I know how you feel.
There were countdowns...

348
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,242
当我有疑虑的时候
when I had my doubts.

349
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:02,711
我在心里想着
你会同意的
I said to myself,
"You agreed to do it.

350
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:05,370
你被抱着
"You're strapped in...

351
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,293
手牵手
"and you're in the hands

352
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:11,679
跟一个比你高大强壮的人
"of something bigger
and more powerful than yourself.

353
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:19,973
既然这样,为什么你不
跟我一起呢？
"So why not just lay back
and enjoy the ride?"

354
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:24,144
我不想去
你有问题
I'm not going.
There is something wrong with you.

355
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,359
哦,上帝,我就是一个蠢货
Oh, God, I'm such a shit.

356
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:41,788
等一下,那肯定就是了
就在那里? 哦,上帝!
- Wait! That must be it.
- Right there? Oh, God!

357
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,713
哦,佛莱普,这太棒了,
这是真的么？
Oh, Flap, it's great.
Is that it, really?

358
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:48,296
哦,确实不错
是不是很甜美？
- I think that's it.
- Oh, it's great. Isn't that sweet?

359
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:53,383
哦,那有块撞痕
哦,是的
- Oh, that was a bump.
- Oh, yeah.

360
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,007
那是什么?
我们要不要去看看房子？
- What is that?
- Shall we go see the house?

361
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:00,470
你在那里等一下
我周围看看再回来找你
You stay here.
I'll come round and get you.

362
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,769
快点 咱们离开这
Come on. Let's get this off.

363
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,440
来吧
Come on.

364
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,605
哇! 快点
Come on.

365
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:15,026
哦,甜心,你伤到你自己吗?
不,没有
- Sweetheart, did you hurt yourself?
- Nope, not yet.

366
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,702
你喜欢它吗?
你喜欢它吗?
Do you like it? Do you like it?

367
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:23,664
哦,它太棒了
佛莱普,它太棒了
Oh, it's great. Flap, it's great!

368
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:26,078
哦,我的上帝
Oh, my God.

369
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,142
把床垫留在这,
我们可以睡在这里
Leave the mattress here.
We can sleep here.

370
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,980
我真的很累
I'm really tired.

371
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,004
你曾经在爱荷华州作爱?
You ever made love in lowa?

372
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:21,095
你知道些什么?
汤米的房间在另一边
You know what? Tommy's room
is on the other side of the hall,

373
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,012
因此我们能大声一点
so we can get noisy.

374
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:27,232
好的,你可以开始叫了
Good. You get to make your little
high-pitched squeak.

375
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:33,570
停!你呢？
你呢？
Stop it! What about you?
What about you?

376
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:36,657
我来了
我又来了
"Here I come. Here I come again!

377
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,862
是的! 是的!
是的!
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

378
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,458
我又来了
Here I come again.

379
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,166
是的!
Yes.

380
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,621
是的!
Yes.

381
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:53,083
是的!
哦,上帝
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

382
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,749
你刚刚把我弄湿了
You just made me wet.

383
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,680
你怎么发出那种声音的？
How can you do that with your voice,
just like that?

384
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,719
你刚才那么发声了
You just make your voice like that.

385
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,559
哦,上帝,
如果汤米听不到我们
我们也听不到汤米
Oh, God, if Tommy can't hear us,
we can't hear Tommy!

386
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:14,604
他很好,妈妈
不要闹,我马上回来
- He's fine, mother!
- Don't get pissy, I'll be back!

387
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:20,913
∮铃正在呜响∮
∮ The bells are ringing∮

388
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,066
∮为了我和我的女孩∮
∮ For me and my gal∮

389
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,315
∮鸟正在唱∮
∮ The birds are singing∮

390
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:29,418
∮ 为我和我的女孩∮
∮ For me and my gal∮

391
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:30,053
和我一起唱!

∮通知所有的女孩们∮
∮ Every Susie and Sal ∮

397
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:49,022
我有一些卷子要改
这不是爱,是自私
I have papers to grade.
This isn't love, it's selfishness.

398
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:52,392
我们在一起已经一周了
It's been a week since
we've been together.

399
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,892
我们从未离去一个星期
We've never gone a whole week, Flap.

400
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:59,614
当然,是的
只有在真正的怀孕的数个月中
- Sure, we've gone a week.
- Only in the real pregnant months.

401
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,908
你总是晚回家
佛莱普,哦,忘了它,忘了它!
You're always getting home so late,
Flap. Oh, forget it. Forget it!

402
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:09,077
做我喜欢的事,
不要让我感觉我很愚蠢,
我没有让你感觉羞愧
Do me a favour. Don't make me feel
silly, I won't make you feel guilty.

403
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,837
很公平
我必须加快点了
Fair enough. I have to hurry.

404
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,213
好孩子
Be a good boy.

405
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,684
艾玛?
Emma?

406
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:38,153
你回来我很高兴
你这么做挽回了我们的生活
I love that you came back. You're
saving our lives by doing this.

407
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,730
你回来我很高兴,佛莱普,
我很高兴
I love that you came back, Flap,
I love it!

408
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,948
汤米,早餐马上就好了
Tommy, breakfast will be in a minute.

409
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,822
快点,我需要改这些卷子
Let's hurry.
I've got to grade those papers.

410
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,953
我将给每个人一个" B"
I'll give everybody a B!

411
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,244
快点
不,等一下
Come on! Wait!

412
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,909
快点 快点
Come on, come on!

413
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:50,348
哈罗
嗨,妈妈 我们可以等一会儿再说话吗?
Hello? Hi, Mother.
Could we talk later?

414
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:54,386
我要帮孩子脱衣服
没时间讲电话
I've got to get the boys off and it's
not a good time to be on the phone.

415
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:58,230
要考虑别人
我准备好认真的谈一谈了
Don't be so inconsiderate.
I'm all set to have a good talk.

416
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:02,186
你已经花了将近一个小时为孩子脱衣服了,
到底怎么回事?
You've got almost an hour
to get the boys off. What's wrong?

417
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,235
没事
别说了,先告诉我怎么了？
- Nothing.
- Stop here. Tell me what it is.

418
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:11,701
好的,母亲,我需要一些钱
我需要你借给我一些钱
OK, Mother. I need some money.
I need you to loan me some money.

419
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,830
我真的需要它,你借不借？
I really need it, so will you?

420
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,334
哦,母亲,别不说话
你知道那对我来说是很困难的
Oh, Mother, please don't be quiet.
You know that was hard for me to ask.

421
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,880
你可以说不,但是不要不说话
You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.

422
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:27,346
哦,对不起,甜心
我刚才在思考
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was just thinking.

423
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:29,258
思考什么?
Thinking what?

424
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,390
考虑我多么不想拿出这些钱
How much I hate to part with money.

425
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,268
我就不会问如果我
I wouldn't have asked if...

426
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:39,436
不要大叫,
但是我想我还会怀孕的
Don't yell, but I really think
that I may be pregnant again.

427
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:41,852
哦! 不!
Oh! No!

428
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:46,489
而且我想你也不得不接受这个
Oh, no! And you're going
to have it, I suppose?

429
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:50,988
是的, 当然
你到底怎么了？
Yes, of course.
What's happening to you, anyway?

430
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,618
不要做这么可怕的行为
Don't act like that's so terrible.

431
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:57,456
很简单,
一个聪明的女人会去做掉这个孩子的
Bright young women
are having simple abortions.

432
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,039
简单?
"Simple"?

433
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,997
然后他们找到多姿多彩的工作
你能在科罗拉多州做掉它
Then they get wonderful jobs.
You can have it in Colorado.

434
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:06,710
我不知道为什么要告诉你所有的事,
我好像越来越不喜欢你了
I don't know why I tell you anything.
I seem to like you less.

435
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:12,221
你知道为什么,艾玛?
因为只有我跟你说实话
You know why? I am the only person
who tells you the truth.

436
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,516
去穿衣服
Go get dressed.

437
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:19,764
你的生活怎么可能好转呢？
如果你继续怀上他的孩子
How will your life get better if you
keep having children with that man?

438
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:23,275
你在等待奇迹来拯救你么？
What miracle is going to come along
to rescue you?

439
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:29,534
别管我,我需要钱
给我画卖
Leave me alone. I need the money.
Give me the painting to sell.

440
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,658
不! 那是你的最后保障
No! That's your security.

441
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:34,237
我不会让你用的
I will not have you
using that for rent!

442
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,956
不要这么做
好不好？
Let's not do this. All right?

443
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:41,495
我稍后再跟你说,
好不好？
All right? I'll talk to you later.

444
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,213
好不好？
All right?

445
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,962
好吧,如果钱意味着
All right. If it would mean that...

446
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:52,891
不,不,它会使我疯掉的
No, don't give me the money.
It'd make you crazy.

447
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:55,383
是的
Yes, it would.

448
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:59,428
我们以后再说吧,
如果需要,晚上给我打电话
We'll talk later. You call me
tonight, if you want, all right?

449
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,183
再见
Goodbye.

450
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:07,064
爸爸刚刚回家
Daddy just got home.

451
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:10,442
嗨,不许开玩笑
做一个天才是不是很辛苦？
Hey, no kidding?
Is it tough being a genius?

452
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,361
孩子
Boy!

453
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:31,842
好消息,我知道我的课题了
我全都弄清楚了
Great news. I know what my topic is.
I have it all figured out.

454
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,854
怎么回事?
What's wrong?

455
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:46,226
你整晚都去了哪里？佛莱普
Where have you been all night, Flap?

456
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,694
很抱歉,我再一次在图书馆里面
那张大的沙发上睡着了
I'm sorry. I fell asleep on
that big sofa at the library again.

457
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,655
我不知道我怎么了
I don't know what's wrong with me.

458
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,782
我看透你了
I'm on to you.

459
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:08,046
我什么都没做
I'm not doing anything.

460
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:11,051
哦,瞎说,你做了
Oh, yes, you are.

461
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:14,138
我们每次都在
这个问题上吵
We go through this stage
every time...

462
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,548
不要扯开话题
Don't change the subject.

463
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,931
什么话题？
What's the subject?

464
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,059
我看透你了
That I'm on to you.

465
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:24,730
你看起来不像是清白的
除非你有愧的
You wouldn't try to look so innocent
unless you were guilty.

466
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:30,060
你应该记住我的话
你没有其他的选择
You'll have to take my word for it.
You have no other choice.

467
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,365
对不起
Excuse me.

468
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:47,088
艾玛,
你总是有点爱遐想
Emma, you... always get
a little paranoid

469
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,462
在你的开始怀孕的
几个月中,是不是?
in your first few months, OK?

470
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,590
只是--
Just...

471
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:57,179
如果你正在做某事
If you are doing something

472
00:41:57,266 --> 00:42:00,552
是为了把我刺激疯了,
因为我怀孕了
and you're trying to make me feel
crazy because I'm pregnant,

473
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:04,345
你陷入这么深
你无可救药
then you may have sunk so low
that you'll never recover.

474
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,398
你可能刚刚感到恐慌,
佛莱普,而且尝试解救你自己,
You may have just panicked, Flap,
and trying to save yourself,

475
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:13,022
你已经脱离了你的个性和原则
you've thrown out
your character and principles.

476
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:16,816
唯一的方法你可以赎回你自己
The only way to redeem yourself, and
be the man God intended you to be,

477
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:20,244
就是承认你昨晚做过的
is to admit anything you
might have been doing last night.

478
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:23,498
所有的事情
Cos if you don't do that,
if you don't do that right now,

479
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:25,624
如果你不这么做,
你就是个废物
you are a lost man.

480
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:28,997
一个白痴
一袋大粪
A shell, a bag of shit dust.

481
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:35,591
你必须告诉我
为了我们,亲爱的
You've got to tell me.
For us, honey. Come on.

482
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:42,018
哈罗
Hello?

483
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:45,185
哈罗,奥罗拉
Hello, Aurora.

484
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,189
你好吗?
How are you?

485
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:52,112
是的, 她--她就在这里
Yes, she is. She's right here.

486
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:54,355
真高兴再次听到你的声音
Nice to hear your voice again.

487
00:42:56,951 --> 00:43:00,651
你何不找一份工作
如果你担心钱的问题？
Why don't you get a job
if you're worried about money?

488
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,739
那孩子怎么办？
What about the baby?

489
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:05,868
你上班的那天
将会是非常棒的一天
It's a great day
when you get tenure!

490
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,289
你上班意味着
我们永远都不会有足够的钱
All tenure means is
we won't have enough money forever!

491
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:12,872
你为什么不问你的母亲?
Why don't you ask your mother?

492
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,550
很方便的,对吧？
去! 打电话给她!
- That's convenient for you!
- Go ahead! Call her!

493
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:19,722
今天没什么不对劲的吧？
Why should today be any different?

494
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:22,642
打电话,艾玛!
打电话,
Get on the phone, Emma!
Get on the phone!

495
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:26,771
你为什么不打？
是的,我打给奥罗拉,对不对?
- Why don't you call?
- Yeah, I'll call Aurora, right(!)

496
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:31,067
打电话!打电话!
打电话!艾玛!
Get on the phone! Get on the phone!
Get on the phone, Emma!

497
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:36,146
打电话!
打电话!该死的
Get on the phone!
Get on the damn phone!

498
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,615
妈妈说就在这里等候
如果你愿意就再呆在这儿吧
- Mommy said to wait right here.
- Stay if you want.

499
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:57,713
你们在这里做什么？
我告诉你们在屋子前面等
What are you guys doing here? I told
you to wait in front of the house.

500
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,630
回答我,汤米
Answer me, Tommy.

501
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:02,130
我不想要人知道
我们在那里居住
I didn't want people
to think we lived there.

502
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:03,423
什么?
What?

503
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:06,684
我不想要人知道
我们在那里居住
I didn't want people
to think we lived there.

504
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,979
住口
Cut it out.

505
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:15,736
你一年只允许
跟我说一件有意义的事
OK. You're allowed to say
one mean thing to me a year.

506
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,779
直到你十岁
That'll do till you're ten.

507
00:44:17,865 --> 00:44:19,858
你想把爸爸赶走
You're driving Daddy away.

508
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:24,778
汤米,站起来,跟我走
别让我在街上揍你
OK, Tommy. Stand up and follow me.
Don't make me hit you on the street.

509
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:26,781
赶快
Hurry up.

510
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,916
我说了快点,快点 !
I said hurry. Come on!

511
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:36,505
44美元
Forty-four dollars.

512
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:47,557
20,30
Twenty, thirty...

513
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:57,436
看看吧,38,40--
Let's see. That's $38.40...

514
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:00,320
你的钱不够?
You don't have enough money?

515
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:09,492
我没有支票
我会放一些东西回去
I don't have any cheques. I guess
I'll have to put some things back.

516
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:13,416
能给我寄存器按钮么？
她没有充足的钱!
Can I have the register key?
She doesn't have enough money!

517
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:20,543
这并不是一件大事
我带错了钱包
It's no big thing.
I brought the wrong purse.

518
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:22,676
这里,给你
Here, take this.

519
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,557
$4375
43.75.

520
00:45:31,397 --> 00:45:33,390
$4135
41.35.

521
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:37,975
妈妈,你答应我可以买东西的
我不是真的给她买吃的
- You said I could have something!
- I won't give her real food.

522
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,312
给她这个
没门!
- Give her this.
- No way!

523
00:45:40,406 --> 00:45:42,862
$4035
妈妈!
- 40.35.
- Mom!

524
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,035
好的
给
All right. Here.

525
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,863
$4055
40.55.

526
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:56,618
$4075,我们方向错了
40.75. We're going
in the wrong direction.

527
00:45:56,714 --> 00:45:59,039
为什么你这么烦？
Why do you have to be so damn nasty?

528
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:02,584
我的意思是,这没什么好处
It's not going to help anything.

529
00:46:03,262 --> 00:46:05,302
我们两个都是人,你明白么?
We're both people, you know?

530
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:08,715
$4075
40.75.

531
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:11,135
我不需要它
I don't need it.

532
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:18,945
霍顿太太,
我是银行的萨姆 勃
Mrs Horton, I'm Sam Burns
from the bank.

533
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:21,697
我到你家去过两次
I turned you down on the second
on your house.

534
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:25,232
哦, 当然我记得你是谁
Oh, of course.
I remember who you are.

535
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:27,899
我能帮助你吗？
Can I help you make up
the difference?

536
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:32,207
谢谢,我很高兴这样
我明天还给你
Thanks. I'd appreciate it.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

537
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,619
你是个非常粗鲁无礼的女人
You're a very rude young woman.

538
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:41,877
我认识道格拉斯
我不能相信他竟然这么对待客户
I know Douglas and I doubt he'd want
you treating customers so badly.

539
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:44,803
我不认为对她不好
I don't think
I was treating her badly.

540
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:47,343
你一定是纽约来的
Then you must be from New York.

541
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:57,139
小心,泰迪!
什么?
- Be careful, Teddy!
- What?

542
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,272
小心!
Be careful!

543
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:04,858
你的汽车在哪里?
就在这里
- Where's your car?
- Right here.

544
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:09,907
那是我这辈子最郁闷的时候
我不知道我能这么快就兴奋起来
That was worst time ever. I didn't
know I could get cheered up so fast.

545
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:12,035
没事
来啊,妈妈
- No problem.
- Come on, Mom.

546
00:47:12,123 --> 00:47:14,162
在汽车这儿等一下
快点
- Wait by the car.
- Come on!

547
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,289
等一下
不
- Wait there.
- No!

548
00:47:16,377 --> 00:47:18,785
在汽车这儿等一下,亲爱的
但是--
- Wait by the car, honey.
- But...

549
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,379
等一下,亲爱!
在汽车那里!
Wait over by the car, honey!
Over by the car!

550
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:24,708
现在!
现在!
Now! Now!

551
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:25,965
现在!
Now!

552
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:32,222
好孩子
Nice boys.

553
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:36,181
你跟他们在一起很不错
真的
You're great with them, too. Really.

554
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,857
我觉得我们三个都在经历一个阶段
I think all three of us
are going through a stage.

555
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:44,110
嗨,再一次谢谢
哦, 没有必要谢谢
- Hey, thanks again.
- Oh, no thanks required.

556
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,236
我度过了一段很甜美的时光
I've had a lovely time.

557
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,150
我也是
Me, too.

558
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,449
我会把钱给你的
I'll get the money back to you.

559
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:54,913
不用麻烦了,
如果你愿意你可以寄过来
Oh, don't bother yourself.
Just drop it in the mail.

560
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:57,620
到银行?
当然
- To the bank?
- Sure.

561
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,497
你甚至可以用挂号信
You could even use
a cheque-by-mail envelope.

562
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:04,538
或者你也可以亲自过来
Or... you could come in.
Whichever.

563
00:48:05,301 --> 00:48:07,340
有时间也许我就过去
Maybe I'll come in some time.

564
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:13,388
好吧
Well, that'd be fine.

565
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:24,652
我能帮你搞定那个么？
不,谢谢。我已经习惯了
- Hey, can I help you with that?
- No, thanks. I'm used to this.

566
00:48:26,864 --> 00:48:31,241
另外一个生日
对于叫做奥罗拉 格林威
的女人来说
"And so, another birthday
for a gal named Aurora Greenway

567
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:35,823
即使50岁了
她仍然让我大吃一惊
"Even though 50,
she still takes my breath away

568
00:48:35,915 --> 00:48:39,865
她仅仅一个注视着天空
的动作就引起了大家的注意
"Mere mortals just gaze
as she lights up their sky

569
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:43,579
一个下凡的仙女
"A heavenly object, a siren's cry"

570
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:47,591
你是最好的
生日快乐
You're the best. Happy birthday.

571
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:51,546
谢谢你,爱德华
Thank you, Edward.

572
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:54,555
谢谢你
Thank you.

573
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:56,681
你想要吗? 弗农
Do you want one, Vernon?

574
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:59,177
你想要一个吻吗?
Would you like a kiss?

575
00:49:00,898 --> 00:49:03,520
你没有隐瞒你的年龄,是么？
You're not lying about your age,
are you?

576
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:06,983
当然没有
Of course not.

577
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,606
我认为你52岁
I thought you were 52.
She's really 52.

578
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,784
你认为你能瞒过一个家庭医生？
Come on, how do you expect
to fool a family doctor?

579
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:16,621
她说了她的年龄
谢谢你
- It seems to me she said her age.
- Thank you.

580
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:20,655
这并没多大关系
但是它的背后意味着什么
The number doesn't matter,
but the effort to conceal it does.

581
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:23,456
他为什么没完没了的说
烈查医生
- Why does he keep talking? 
I'm trying to do some good here!
- Dr Ratcher...

582
00:49:25,756 --> 00:49:28,841
老年人的调整方法--
医生,
- The way to adjust to old age...
- Doctor...

583
00:49:28,926 --> 00:49:32,378
我想你有点不清楚
因为长时间独自生活的原因
I think you're confused,
being recently widowed and all.

584
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:57,868
你好么？
You OK?

585
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:11,130
让我们给她一些隐私吧
Let's give her some privacy.

586
00:50:30,029 --> 00:50:32,900
嗯？
门是开着的
Yeah? The door's open.

587
00:50:34,158 --> 00:50:36,198
等一下子
Just a minute.

588
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:47,042
好吧,哈罗
Well, hello.

589
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,755
嗨
Hi.

590
00:50:53,094 --> 00:50:56,593
我想知道你是否
还想跟我吃午饭
I was curious if you still wanted
to take me to lunch.

591
00:50:59,308 --> 00:51:01,384
我不明白我们--
I wasn't aware that we...

592
00:51:01,477 --> 00:51:03,885
几年前你曾经
邀请我共进午餐
A few years back,
you invited me to lunch.

593
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,019
几年前？
A few years back?

594
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:10,436
邀请仍然有效吗?
你愿意?
I wondered if the invitation
still exists. Would you like to?

595
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:13,652
共进午餐
Do lunch.

596
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:16,906
不是晚餐,记好,是午餐
- Not dinner, remember. It was lunch.
- Why not? No.

597
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:18,819
好的
Good.

598
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:21,242
何时?
When?

599
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,281
明天?
Tomorrow?

600
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:27,416
明天?
Tomorrow?

601
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:30,996
好的
好的
All right. All right.

602
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,798
好的
Good.

603
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,257
12:30?
Twelve thirty?

604
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:40,759
12:00
Twelve.

605
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:43,427
好的
Good.

606
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:19,968
谢谢你
Thank you.

607
00:52:25,061 --> 00:52:26,471
谢谢
Thanks.

608
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:39,947
如果你介意露在外面
我可以把车顶关上
If you mind the open air,
I could get the top.

609
00:52:40,034 --> 00:52:42,074
不,不用操心
No. Don't worry.

610
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:45,862
成熟的女人都随时准备好了
应付生活中的一些细小的紧急事件
Grown women are prepared
for life's little emergencies.

611
00:53:02,557 --> 00:53:06,886
我们一起出去 --
不错,哈？
Us going out together...
Not bad, huh?

612
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:11,355
你想吗？
你可以把车顶关上么？
Do you think...? Do you think
you could possibly put the top up?

613
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,062
车顶在家里的车库里呢
The top's at home in the garage.

614
00:53:27,957 --> 00:53:30,329
哈罗,你好吗?
Hello, there. How are you?

615
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:36,538
你好吗,阿里?
见到你很高兴
How are you, Ali?
It's nice to see you.

616
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:54,101
在酒吧的那个家伙,
佛烈德?
他邀我出去
Fred, that we met at that bar.
He asked me out.

617
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:58,272
哦,上帝
他将我带到卡迪拉克酒吧
- Oh, God.
- We went to the Cadillac Bar.

618
00:53:58,362 --> 00:54:03,190
一个有趣的地方
如果你跟对人了
但是我没有
It's a fun place if you're with
the right people, but I wasn't.

619
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:33,472
好吧
我好饿
Well... l'm starving!

620
00:54:34,607 --> 00:54:37,015
那么说没别的意思
No hidden meaning in that remark.

621
00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:40,238
好吧,阿--
你想要一个牡蛎吗?
Well... Would you like an oyster?

622
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:48,787
不
No.

623
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:52,790
谢谢
很不错的
- Thank you.
- It's good.

624
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,122
我认为那是
极端粗鲁无礼的,
I think that is extremely rude,

625
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:03,549
当你和我在一起的时候
注视别的女人
noticing other women
when you're with me.

626
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,297
我,嗯
I...

627
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:09,473
认为我们快喝醉了
think we're going
to have to get drunk.

628
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:12,809
我没喝醉
我不在乎谁护送
I don't get drunk,
and I don't care for escorts who do.

629
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,979
你带我进来的
You got me into this.

630
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:22,065
相信我吧
You're just gonna have to trust me
about this one thing.

631
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:25,938
你需要多喝点
You need a lot of drinks.

632
00:55:26,033 --> 00:55:28,405
打破僵局?
To break the ice?

633
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:31,910
解除烦恼
To kill the bug that you have
up your ass.

634
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,749
我可以给你些什么吗?
May I get you something?

635
00:55:37,837 --> 00:55:42,298
是的,我想来些烈酒
最好是 Wild Turkey（土耳其烈酒）
Yes, I think I will have some
bourbon, preferably Wild Turkey.

636
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:56,267
什么?
Yes?

637
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:59,107
你一点也不有趣
You're not fun, by any chance,
are you?

638
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:02,940
我们现在不该想那个
I don't really think we should think
about that right now.

639
00:56:05,448 --> 00:56:08,614
不耐心会错掉很多事情
Impatient boys
sometimes miss dessert.

640
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:25,540
我们同时到这里
We both got here at the same time!

641
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:32,139
你好, 萨姆你好吗?
很高兴见到你
Hi, Sam. How are you?
It's nice to see you.

642
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:35,843
很高兴见到你
我几乎不能相信
It's always so nice to see you.
I can hardly believe it.

643
00:56:35,937 --> 00:56:37,763
我也是
You, too.

644
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:41,767
我没想到有那些时刻
What I didn't expect
was there to be moments

645
00:56:41,859 --> 00:56:45,643
我会忘记我害怕有人见到我们在一起
where I'd forget to be scared
someone would see us together.

646
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:47,896
萨姆, 你不一定要害怕
Sam, you don't have to be scared.

647
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,240
我的意思是,
正视错误是我们已经做的
I mean, contemplating sin
is all we've done, it's OK.

648
00:56:51,327 --> 00:56:55,621
我很高兴你已经想过了
Oh. I'm glad that you've been
contemplating it, too.

649
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:57,829
我不知道
I didn't know that.

650
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:01,416
那么,这些午餐
所有的这些,
就这样由着它们吗?
Well, all these lunches,
all this hand holding?

651
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:07,166
我今天下午不会回银行
I'm not going back to the bank
this afternoon.

652
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,344
我要出去调查一些房子
I have to go out
and inspect a new house.

653
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:16,435
很远,而且--
很空旷
It's pretty far out,
and, well... it's empty.

654
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:24,898
5:00我要去接孩子
哦,好的
- I gotta pick up my kids at five.
- Oh, OK.

655
00:57:24,986 --> 00:57:28,568
我理解
别想了
Well, I understand.
Look, don't give it a thought.

656
00:57:30,157 --> 00:57:35,069
艾玛
我没有跟其他女人做爱
Emma, I haven't made love
to a woman...

657
00:57:36,914 --> 00:57:38,954
几乎3年了
in almost three years.

658
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:42,040
怎么会这样？
How come?

659
00:57:42,128 --> 00:57:44,666
我的妻子生理上有问题
My wife has a disc problem.

660
00:57:45,756 --> 00:57:48,045
她不能忍受
And she can't take having...

661
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:50,376
任何重量在她身上
any weight on her.

662
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:55,923
萨姆, 我希望你不介意
我问这个,但是
Sam, I hope you don't mind me
asking you this, but...

663
00:57:56,434 --> 00:58:00,099
你没想过你妻子可以在上面吗?
have you ever thought of
your wife getting on top?

664
00:58:00,187 --> 00:58:02,857
哦,她不喜欢那样子
Oh, she wouldn't do that.

665
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:05,268
她可能令你吃惊
She may surprise you.

666
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,902
我不这么认为
那不像她
No, I don't think so.
It would be so unlike her.

667
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:14,069
你问过她吗?
大概 600 次
- Did you ask?
- About 600 times.

668
00:58:26,088 --> 00:58:28,247
你在想什么?
What are you thinking?

669
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:31,258
告诉我你更喜欢德克萨斯
还是爱何华州?
Tell me, do you prefer Texas to lowa?

670
00:58:31,344 --> 00:58:36,006
你到底在想什么?
那就是我在想的,当你问我的时候
- What were you really thinking?
- Really, that's what I was thinking.

671
00:58:37,225 --> 00:58:41,637
我不知道,
好像是缺少一些野性,
你知道吗?
I don't know, there seems to be
an absence of wildness, you know?

672
00:58:41,729 --> 00:58:44,481
甚至在众人中
Even in the people!

673
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:52,442
我们是农民,我们谈论贫穷
因为农民方面是
Well, we're farmers and we talk poor,
because the farmer aspect is

674
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:54,857
别让任何人知道你有什么,
"don't let anybody know
you have anything"

675
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:57,821
别太引人注意
and "don't call attention
to yourself".

676
00:58:57,912 --> 00:59:02,206
我妻子说--
我觉得我们不应该谈论 多蒂
My wife says... Well, I guess
we shouldn't talk about Dottie.

677
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:09,879
我吹过我的头发!
控制!
Wind in the hair! Lead in the pencil!

678
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:14,877
控制整个宇宙!
Feet controlling the universe!

679
00:59:14,971 --> 00:59:17,972
我热爱掌舵!
Breedlove at the helm!

680
00:59:20,434 --> 00:59:23,104
尽情踩下油门!
Just keep pumping that throttle!

681
00:59:23,187 --> 00:59:25,725
加油!
Keep giving it that gas!

682
00:59:26,857 --> 00:59:30,143
我看到了墨西哥海湾!
I see the Gulf of Mexico below me!

683
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:32,857
我并不喜欢这样!
I'm not enjoying this!

684
00:59:32,947 --> 00:59:35,070
给它个机会
Give it a chance.

685
00:59:35,658 --> 00:59:37,864
我要停止了!
I am going to stop!

686
00:59:37,952 --> 00:59:40,360
∮带我去月球 ∮∮
Fly me to the moon!

687
00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:02,601
你怎样?
不是我的错,对不起
How are you?
It's not my fault, but I'm sorry.

688
01:00:02,685 --> 01:00:07,680
如果你想让我背部着地
你要先问我
If you wanted to get me on my back,
you just had to ask me.

689
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,073
我的手!
My hand!

690
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:28,627
拿出来!
Get it out of there!

691
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:31,665
我不能!我发誓!
拿出来!
- I can't! I swear!
- Get it out!

692
01:00:31,756 --> 01:00:33,748
我向上帝发誓!
拿出来!
- I swear to God!
- Out!

693
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:37,625
我们过得很愉快
那你要做这个!
We were having such a good time
and you had to go do this!

694
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,932
请说吧,任何事!
弯腰!
弯腰!
Please, anything!
Bend down! Bend down!

695
01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:51,227
你为什么要喝醉呢?
我没喝醉--
再来!
- Why did you have to get drunk?
- I am not drunk... any more!

696
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:53,986
疼痛使我清醒
The pain sobered me up.

697
01:01:14,757 --> 01:01:19,300
艾玛,这可能很可怕,
你心里在想你的丈夫吗?
Emma, this is terrible to ask -
are you thinking about your husband?

698
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:21,426
有一点
我们可以回去
- I was a little.
- We can go back.

699
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:25,891
不, 萨姆 停止
告诉你,我想做这个
No, Sam. Stop it.
Look, I want to do this.

700
01:01:25,977 --> 01:01:29,926
我很高兴佛莱普不知道
我是否跟其他人在一起
I'm glad I don't know whether
Flap's been with someone else.

701
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:34,150
我不愿意去想我这么做
只是为了平衡心态
I'd hate to think I was doing this
just to get even.

702
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:47,403
哦,只是看太棒了!
好的
Oh, just... Look... Great! Fine.

703
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:50,208
太棒了
Great!

704
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:54,160
你停在我的车位!
你违反了规定!
You're parked in my driveway!
You're breaking the law!

705
01:01:55,673 --> 01:01:57,298
谢谢你!
Thank you!

706
01:02:01,345 --> 01:02:03,385
你想进来吗?
Would you like to come in?

707
01:02:03,472 --> 01:02:07,304
我宁可在我眼里插针
I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.

708
01:02:07,393 --> 01:02:11,972
每件事情都不错
如果你没喝醉
Everything would have been just fine
if you hadn't gotten drunk.

709
01:02:12,064 --> 01:02:16,192
别认为我像其他的女孩
I just didn't want you to think
I was like one of your other girls.

710
01:02:16,277 --> 01:02:20,275
没有危险
除非你跪在我的面前
Not much danger in that unless you
curtsy on my face real soon.

711
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:23,733
盖瑞特 !
Garrett!

712
01:02:23,826 --> 01:02:29,781
什么使你
坚持攻击我?
What makes you so insistent
on shocking and insulting me?

713
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:34,325
我的意思是,
我真讨厌这种对话,
你一定知道
I mean, I really hate that
way of talking. You must know that.

714
01:02:35,254 --> 01:02:37,211
你为什么那样做?
Why do you do it?

715
01:02:38,299 --> 01:02:41,549
我会告诉你, 奥罗拉
I'll tell you, Aurora.

716
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:44,305
我不知道你怎么觉得
不过
I don't know what it is
about you, but...

717
01:02:45,431 --> 01:02:47,471
你确实能引出
我心里的邪恶
you do bring out the devil in me.

718
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:58,318
你在哪里?
Where are you?

719
01:02:58,402 --> 01:03:01,688
在洗衣间,
所以没人能听见
In the laundry room
so nobody could hear.

720
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:03,820
萨姆, 我也听不到你
Sam, I can't hear you, either.

721
01:03:05,534 --> 01:03:08,535
等一会
会安静的
Wait a minute.
We're getting a quieter cycle.

722
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:10,863
好的
能听到了吗?
- OK.
- Can you hear me now?

723
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:13,958
是的
打电话不好吗?
- Yeah.
- Good. Is it bad to call?

724
01:03:14,043 --> 01:03:17,079
不,我正在超市
不能太卿卿我我
No, I'm in the market
for a little sweet talk.

725
01:03:17,171 --> 01:03:20,089
妈妈,我要上厕所!
只一会儿
- Mom, I have to go!
- Just a minute.

726
01:03:20,174 --> 01:03:21,882
什么?
是吗!
- What?
- Really!

727
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:25,761
快点
Hurry up.

728
01:03:27,056 --> 01:03:31,220
这是什么?
我觉得非常好
- What is it?
- Just how absolutely good I feel.

729
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:35,972
尽管我被吓到了
我们已经承认通奸行为
And even though I'm scared,
and we've committed adultery,

730
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:38,141
不管发生什么
no matter what happens,

731
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:40,903
我很感激上帝或者魔鬼
I'm just so grateful
to God or the devil

732
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:46,147
让我再次拥有这种感觉
for... letting me
feel this way again.

733
01:03:46,242 --> 01:03:49,243
我很高兴你告诉我
I'm so glad you told me that.

734
01:03:49,328 --> 01:03:51,998
别冲水
你说过要我每次都冲水的
- Don't flush!
- You told me always to!

735
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:54,537
这次不行
Not this time.

736
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:58,077
艾玛, 一切都好吗?你能说话吗?
不,但很好
- Emma, is it OK? Can you talk?
- No, it's all right.

737
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:00,578
我可以告诉 梅尔尼?
可以
- Can I hold Melanie?
- Yes.

738
01:04:03,759 --> 01:04:06,595
亲爱的, 一切都好吗?
什么?
- Honey, is everything OK?
- What?

739
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:09,217
一切都好吗?
一切都好吗?
- Is everything OK?
- Everything's fine.

740
01:04:09,307 --> 01:04:11,465
哦,是的,
一切都好
Oh, yeah. Everything's fine.

741
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:17,728
我有个紧急电话
来自于 奥罗拉 格林威
在休斯敦, 德克萨斯
给艾玛 霍顿
An emergency call from Mrs Aurora
Greenway in Houston for Emma Horton.

742
01:04:17,815 --> 01:04:21,647
哦,不!
她在占线的时候打来
- Oh, no!
- She does that when the line's busy.

743
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:25,983
你会挂线吗?
当然,我们在聊
- Will you release?
- Of course. We were just talking.

744
01:04:26,073 --> 01:04:28,280
我之后和你谈, 萨姆 再见
Talk to you later, Sam. Bye.

745
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:32,405
怎样?
Hi. How'd it go?

746
01:04:32,496 --> 01:04:34,406
宇航员不可能的
The astronaut is impossible.

747
01:04:34,498 --> 01:04:38,828
自傲的,以自我为中心的
是的,很搞笑得
An arrogant, self-centred,
and, yes, somewhat entertaining man

748
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,914
他已经意识到他的野心,
最后一个捣乱的孩子
who has realised his ambition,
and is at last a spoiled child.

749
01:04:44,008 --> 01:04:49,168
真是天作之合
你是这样认为的,是吗?
- A match made in heaven.
- Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you?

750
01:04:49,263 --> 01:04:52,964
他跟我在一起
什么都不想要
I don't think he wants to have
anything more to do with me.

751
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:56,392
哦,为什么?
我不想这样
- Oh, why?
- I don't wanna go into it.

752
01:04:58,147 --> 01:05:01,231
因为你不跟他睡觉?
第一次约会?
- Cos you wouldn't go to bed?
- On a first date, Emma?

753
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:07,189
不可能是第一个约会
你已经住隔壁有15年了
It's hardly a first date.
You've lived next door for 15 years.

754
01:05:07,281 --> 01:05:10,484
为什么不说说真正原因?
我不知道你什么意思？
- Why not say the real reason?
- What do you mean?

755
01:05:10,576 --> 01:05:13,032
你这样做已经很久了
It's been that long
since you've done it.

756
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,371
闭嘴!我认真的,闭嘴!
Shut up! I mean it! Shut up!

757
01:05:16,457 --> 01:05:17,738
哦,只是我
Oh, it's just me.

758
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,328
不,打给他
- No.
- Call him!

759
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:21,411
不,我要挂了
好的,对不起
- No! I'm hanging up.
- OK, I'm sorry.

760
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:24,339
我挂了
现在就打给他
那么长时间
- I'm hanging up.
- Call him now! So long.

761
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:34,278
你好
你好, 盖瑞特
- Hello?
- Hello, Garrett.

762
01:06:34,827 --> 01:06:36,867
什么事?
Yes?

763
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:41,579
我刚坐在这里意识到--
Well, I was just sitting
here realising...

764
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:44,704
我从没有展示
给你我的雷诺瓦
realising that
I had never shown you my Renoir.

765
01:06:44,795 --> 01:06:46,420
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

766
01:06:46,505 --> 01:06:51,381
我请你过来
看看我的雷诺瓦
I'm inviting you to come over
and look at my Renoir.

767
01:06:51,469 --> 01:06:56,344
你在勾引我上床
是的,在我的卧室
- You're inviting me to bed.
- It happens to be in my bedroom.

768
01:06:56,432 --> 01:06:59,682
雷诺瓦 在床单下面?
Is the Renoir under the covers?

769
01:07:01,395 --> 01:07:04,065
别咯咯笑, 盖瑞特
Don't cackle, Garrett.

770
01:07:04,815 --> 01:07:06,642
你想看吗?
Do you want to see it?

771
01:07:06,734 --> 01:07:09,605
我想去你的卧室吗?
Do I want to come to your bedroom?

772
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,234
让我想想
想不想?
- Let me think.
- Do you?

773
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:21,324
只是--只是--
让我考虑一下
很难决定
Just give me a minute.
It's a tough one.

774
01:07:26,254 --> 01:07:28,293
我想--我不知道
I guess... I don't know.

775
01:07:29,924 --> 01:07:34,918
好的
我猜可以的
是的,为什么不?
Yeah, OK. I guess so, sure, why not?

776
01:07:36,806 --> 01:07:38,680
我一会儿就会看到你
I'll see you in a bit.

777
01:07:38,766 --> 01:07:42,431
如果我不应答,
说明后门是开着的
If I don't answer the bell,
the back door's open.

778
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,975
后门是开着的
The back door's open.

779
01:08:23,477 --> 01:08:25,517
上帝,他跑过来了 -
My God. He ran it.

780
01:08:57,261 --> 01:08:58,672
你好
Hi.

781
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,841
你打电话时,我正在跑圈
I was doing laps when you called.

782
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:09,929
我们真幸运
我只做了8次
Lucky for us, I only did eight.

783
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,437
这就是了
This is it.

784
01:09:15,446 --> 01:09:17,937
这就是 雷诺瓦
This is the Renoir.

785
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,955
我喜欢它
I like it.

786
01:09:31,254 --> 01:09:33,293
我喜欢这画
I like the painting.

787
01:09:36,008 --> 01:09:38,582
这里的每样东西我都喜欢
I like everything in here.

788
01:09:40,763 --> 01:09:41,961
放松,宝贝
Relax, baby...

789
01:09:42,056 --> 01:09:46,303
现在,
你认为你在和谁说话？
Now, just who do you
think you're talking to like this?

790
01:09:46,394 --> 01:09:49,145
难道没感觉到
我已经当祖母了？
Don't you realise
I'm a grandmother?

791
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:13,202
说实话,
一点也看不出来
It's not flattering
to look too surprised.

792
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:16,669
我马上回来
I'll just be a minute.

793
01:10:32,273 --> 01:10:34,064
我喜欢灯亮着
I like the lights on.

794
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:37,186
那就回家把灯都打开
Then go home and turn them on.

795
01:10:37,278 --> 01:10:40,694
哦,对不起
Oh. I'm sorry.

796
01:11:18,694 --> 01:11:20,319
来吧
Come on.

797
01:11:21,906 --> 01:11:24,823
爸爸
醒醒,爸爸
Dad. Come on, wake up, Dad.

798
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:27,860
怎么了？怎么了？
梅尔尼病了
- What? What?
- Melanie's sick.

799
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:29,993
怎么了？
梅尔尼病了
- What?
- Melanie's sick.

800
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:34,327
小宝贝病了
小宝贝病了？
- The baby's sick.
- The baby's sick?

801
01:11:36,295 --> 01:11:38,169
你过来吗,佛莱普?
Are you coming, Flap?

802
01:11:38,256 --> 01:11:41,956
哪里病了？
我得先看看
- What do you think's wrong?
- I have to look first.

803
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:45,964
来啊,爸爸
Come on, Dad.

804
01:11:55,648 --> 01:11:57,226
谢谢
Thank you.

805
01:11:57,316 --> 01:12:00,650
回床上去
她会好起来的
You can go to bed.
She's gonna be all right, she is.

806
01:12:00,736 --> 01:12:04,105
我睡不着
回床上去,我一会儿过去
- I can't sleep.
- Go to bed, I'll be there soon.

807
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:06,072
把这搞得像闹剧
太糟糕了
We're making this a drama.

808
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:08,946
这不该是场闹剧
It's not going to qualify
as high drama.

809
01:12:09,036 --> 01:12:11,278
好了
好了
It's OK, it's OK.

810
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:14,743
谢谢
Thanks.

811
01:12:17,503 --> 01:12:19,543
我确定这是哮喘
I'm sure it's the croup.

812
01:12:21,048 --> 01:12:23,088
记得吗,
汤米得过两次
Remember, Tommy had it twice?

813
01:12:26,012 --> 01:12:28,051
估计那时你在图书馆
Guess you were in the library.

814
01:12:33,102 --> 01:12:35,558
天哪,那是世界上
最糟糕的声音
God, that's the worst
sound in the world.

815
01:12:36,814 --> 01:12:38,937
你会让她在这里呆多久？
How long do you keep her in here?

816
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:46,403
为什么？你要回床睡觉吗?
我只是问问需要多长时间
- Why? Are you going back to bed?
- I just asked how long.

817
01:12:48,284 --> 01:12:50,027
嗯,我不知道
Well, I don't know.

818
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:55,244
直到她喉咙里痰清掉
或者我减去20磅
两者取其一
Until her throat clears or I lose
20 pounds, whichever comes first.

819
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:59,033
我不知道,我不知道
大概20分钟吧
I don't know, I don't know.
About 20 minutes, I guess.

820
01:13:01,631 --> 01:13:03,457
我收到一份录用书
I've been offered a job.

821
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:09,300
什么？
干嘛不多说些？
What?
Why didn't you say something?

822
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,929
我想考虑一下
I wanted to think about it.

823
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:18,271
是英语系主任
在科尔尼州立大学--
It's head of the English department
at Kearney State College.

824
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:20,182
薪水一样
About the same money.

825
01:13:20,274 --> 01:13:23,394
在哪里？
Oh. Where is it?

826
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:24,945
内布拉斯加
Nebraska.

827
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:32,277
我不想搬家
I really don't want to move.

828
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:35,454
我热爱学校,
那林荫道--
I love the school,
the paediatricians...

829
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:37,912
系主任
It's the head of the department.

830
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:42,952
我们稍后谈谈,好吗？
我喜欢这里, 佛莱普
We'll talk about it, all right?
I like it here, Flap.

831
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:48,215
系主任
那-- 很棒
Head of the department, that's...
That's great.

832
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:55,516
再见,妈妈
再见
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye.

833
01:13:55,601 --> 01:13:57,309
过来, 泰迪
Come on, Teddy.

834
01:13:57,395 --> 01:14:00,479
别亲小宝贝
她可能还在生病
Don't kiss the baby,
she may still be sick.

835
01:14:01,023 --> 01:14:03,230
好好学习
Have a good day at school.

836
01:14:10,408 --> 01:14:12,946
哦,糟糕的一晚!
Oh, you don't know the night I had!

837
01:14:13,035 --> 01:14:19,204
梅尔尼凌晨3点得上哮喘,
而我整晚都没合眼
Melanie decided to get the croup at
3am and I haven't gotten any sleep.

838
01:14:19,292 --> 01:14:24,452
他可能在开玩笑
但佛莱普说要带我们
搬去在内布拉斯加的大学
He may be kidding, but Flap says
we're going to some Nebraska college.

839
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:30,466
我不确定,
我想萨姆就是我需要的那人
I'm not sure, but I think
Sam is becoming someone that I need.

840
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:33,922
我睡在宇航员边上
I'm lying here next to the astronaut.

841
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:36,054
真的?
Are you really?

842
01:14:37,643 --> 01:14:39,435
感觉如何？
How was it?

843
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,312
一会儿再和你说
哦,我太为你高兴了
- I'll speak to you later.
- Oh, I feel so good for you.

844
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,772
尽快给我回电
I do. You call me
as soon as you can.

845
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:49,067
再见
再见
- Bye.
- Bye.

846
01:14:50,197 --> 01:14:51,193
梅尔?
Mel...

847
01:14:51,282 --> 01:14:53,654
好的, 梅尔
OK, Mel.

848
01:14:58,372 --> 01:15:02,370
我想说说清楚
你知道的
I just want to make this clear,
you know.

849
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:05,330
我看到其他女人
I see other women.

850
01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:08,540
我不怎么确定
我们是否在约会
I didn't think we were engaged.

851
01:15:08,633 --> 01:15:10,791
好的,好的
你这个自私的家伙！
- OK, OK.
- Your ego, really!

852
01:15:10,885 --> 01:15:14,218
好吧,
今晚一起过吧
OK. Let's stay in tonight.

853
01:15:14,305 --> 01:15:17,804
算是给我个机会
我来做饭
- You're saving a fortune on me.
- I'll cook.

854
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:21,972
已经三个礼拜了,
而你却连我家都没看到过
It's been three weeks,
and you haven't even seen my house.

855
01:15:22,063 --> 01:15:24,636
我的直觉告诉我
应该尽量不去
My best instincts
had me avoiding it.

856
01:15:30,404 --> 01:15:32,314
你在想什么？
What are you thinking?

857
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,664
我来告诉你吧
I'll tell you what.

858
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:49,378
实在很糟糕
I think this is really sad,

859
01:15:49,465 --> 01:15:53,759
我觉得需要用这些
来吸引女孩子
that you feel that you need
all this stuff to impress girls with.

860
01:15:53,844 --> 01:15:55,671
需要？
Need it?

861
01:15:56,347 --> 01:15:58,885
有时这还不够
Sometimes it isn't enough.

862
01:15:58,975 --> 01:16:02,391
动用你的资本
没什么不对的
There's nothing wrong
with using your assets.

863
01:16:02,478 --> 01:16:06,428
我感觉这是在利用你的职业
设计一个性陷阱
I think it turns your profession
into a sex trap.

864
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:10,901
哦,算了吧,
每个人都运用他们所拥有的
我应有此荣誉!
Oh, come on. Everybody uses
whatever they have. I earned it!

865
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:15,695
世界上有106名宇航员,
我是其中一员!
There's 106 astronauts in the
whole world and I'm one of them!

866
01:16:15,783 --> 01:16:18,025
这是我的一部分
It's a big part of me.

867
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:19,946
对不起我并不是
I'm sorry. I didn't...

868
01:16:20,037 --> 01:16:24,165
有意冒犯
如此神圣的原则
I didn't mean to trip
on such a deeply felt principle.

869
01:16:38,139 --> 01:16:41,093
想知道什么让我困惑吗？
Do you want to know what bothers me?

870
01:16:43,978 --> 01:16:49,814
我们中间从没一起呆在一间屋子里,关上所有门,
None of us ever got together
in one room, locked all the doors,

871
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:53,400
分享我们的经历
and compared notes
on the experience.

872
01:16:53,487 --> 01:16:57,532
我想我们得假装
这乐趣并非来自
I think we had to pretend
it wasn't the fun that it was.

873
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:03,078
你们能感受到速度
You do sense the speed.

874
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:07,031
我记得从宇宙飞船
窗子看出去--
I remember looking out
the window of the spacecraft...

875
01:17:09,378 --> 01:17:14,621
听起来就像一个大肚子家伙
在讲他自己关于韩国的故事
I sound like somebody with a big
belly telling their Korea stories.

876
01:17:14,717 --> 01:17:17,386
不管怎么说,我从窗子里看出去
Anyway, once I'm
looking out the window.

877
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:22,891
看到了宇宙飞船的一部分,
这在绕着地球飞啸而过
I see a piece of the spacecraft,
and it's whistling along the ground.

878
01:17:22,975 --> 01:17:25,051
万籁俱寂
It doesn't make a sound.

879
01:17:25,978 --> 01:17:32,147
唯一能听到的,这世界上唯一的声音,
The only sound you hear,
the only noise in the entire world,

880
01:17:32,235 --> 01:17:34,274
就是你的心跳
is your heart beating.

881
01:17:42,286 --> 01:17:44,078
难以形容
It's indescribable.

882
01:17:44,163 --> 01:17:48,410
但不管怎么说,
我没法用更好的语句来描述
Maybe they can think of a better way
of saying it, but that was it.

883
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:52,285
那是我自己的时刻,
永不消逝
That was my moment,
the one that doesn't go away.

884
01:17:53,589 --> 01:17:55,629
理解我的意思吗？
You know what I mean?

885
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:58,092
能理解
Yes.

886
01:18:01,681 --> 01:18:03,258
嘿--
Hey...

887
01:18:03,349 --> 01:18:05,805
现在是我的那一刻了
This is my moment.

888
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:15,022
别害羞
No, don't get nervous, Garrett.

889
01:18:27,665 --> 01:18:29,325
佛莱普?
Flap?

890
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:34,503
有人吗?
Anybody?

891
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:57,898
你不认为这是爱情,
因为我们只是玩玩而已
You don't think it's love
because we're having fun.

892
01:18:57,987 --> 01:19:02,115
爱情一样有快乐
能别做鬼脸吗?
Love can be fun.
Would you stop making faces?

893
01:19:05,036 --> 01:19:07,491
太好了
That's wonderful.

894
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:11,447
这里仅仅是一个
大学女孩对老师的迷恋
What we have here is
a typical grad-school girl crush.

895
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:16,085
能不说
这仅仅是迷恋吗？
Would you please, please, please
stop telling me this is a crush?

896
01:19:16,172 --> 01:19:19,755
和几乎不可能的又有点老的某人约会
The fun with getting involved
with someone unavailable

897
01:19:19,842 --> 01:19:24,504
其乐趣正如通常你听说的，就是那样
and slightly older is sometimes you
get to hear what's really going on.

898
01:19:24,597 --> 01:19:28,677
佛莱普, 你这个--
恶心的家伙!
- Flap, you are such a...
- Incredible asshole!

899
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:33,604
对不起
Excuse me.

900
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:41,942
对不起
看着点,老友!
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, buddy!

901
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:44,366
艾玛!
Emma!

902
01:19:46,494 --> 01:19:49,281
见鬼, 艾玛,
你会毁了我们!
God damn it, Emma, you'll ruin us!

903
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:52,995
因为你是个障碍
我不是!
- Cos you're a spectacle!
- I am not!

904
01:19:55,211 --> 01:19:58,046
别摇晃孩子
她会摔下来的
Stop jiggling her, she'll throw up.

905
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:00,503
你来得太巧了
Your timing was perfect.

906
01:20:00,591 --> 01:20:03,877
在我们要做什么前
你抓住了我们
You caught us before we did anything.

907
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:07,006
我把孩子带去休斯顿
I'm taking the kids to Houston.

908
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:09,090
把孩子给我
Give me the baby.

909
01:20:09,183 --> 01:20:12,220
你不知道我做了什么,
You don't know what I did,

910
01:20:12,311 --> 01:20:18,480
就好像我不知道你
下午开车去了哪里
just like I don't know what you do
on your afternoon drives.

911
01:20:18,568 --> 01:20:22,648
霍顿教授,我们能谈谈
我的成绩吗?
Professor Horton,
can we talk about my grade?

912
01:20:22,738 --> 01:20:26,403
你应该对我离开表示高兴
You ought to be happy I'm going.

913
01:20:26,492 --> 01:20:30,027
如果我留在这里,
对你而言会是场梦魇
If I stayed here,
I'd make life hell for you.

914
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:31,663
别跟着我
Don't follow me.

915
01:20:31,747 --> 01:20:33,989
劳驾
劳驾
Excuse me. Excuse me.

916
01:20:35,501 --> 01:20:38,751
劳驾
劳驾
Excuse me! Excuse me!

917
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,759
是他们。是他们!
It's them. It's them!

918
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:04,561
盖瑞特, 来见见艾玛
不,你不需要局外人
- Garrett, come meet Emma.
- No, you don't need outsiders.

919
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:07,822
你不是局外人!
晚些再见她们吧
- You're no outsider!
- I'll see them later.

920
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:10,446
嗯, 这是盖瑞特
Em, Em, this is Garrett.

921
01:21:10,536 --> 01:21:14,616
噢!很高兴见到你
我听说了很多关于你的事情
Oh! Pleasure to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

922
01:21:14,707 --> 01:21:17,459
你母亲一直想见你
Your mother's been looking
forward to this, too.

923
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:22,337
那么--
你们继续
So, go ahead.

924
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:28,589
怎么了, 盖瑞特?
没什么
- Anything wrong, Garrett?
- No.

925
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:31,135
很高兴见到你
It was very nice to have met you.

926
01:21:31,224 --> 01:21:33,761
回家感觉一定很好
Must be nice to be home.

927
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:36,140
很不错,真的很好
Oh, it's great. It's great.

928
01:21:37,688 --> 01:21:39,681
我一会儿回来
I'll be over later.

929
01:21:39,774 --> 01:21:42,728
孩子们累了,会早早上床的
They're tired,
and will get to sleep early,

930
01:21:42,818 --> 01:21:45,309
我也会很早上床的
and I'd like to get to bed early.

931
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:49,570
外婆,外婆,外婆!
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!

932
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:50,904
再见
Bye-bye.

933
01:21:50,993 --> 01:21:56,332
下车吧好的
这小家伙喜欢挤在一起
Come on out. All right.
This one likes to squeeze.

934
01:21:56,415 --> 01:22:00,912
泰迪喜欢挤,
汤米也喜欢挤
你们就挤在一起了
Teddy likes to squeeze, Tommy likes
a squeeze. You both get a squeeze.

935
01:22:02,421 --> 01:22:05,506
小宝贝
小宝贝在哪里？
The baby. Where's the baby?

936
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:15,176
噢,我的小宝贝
看看小宝贝!
Oh, there is my baby.
Look at the baby!

937
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:18,640
她长得有点像你啊
I think she looks a little like you.

938
01:22:18,729 --> 01:22:24,103
有点？她就像和我
一个模子里造出来的
A little? Gee, it's like
looking in the mirror.

939
01:22:25,361 --> 01:22:28,896
她喜欢兜风
一路上她很少哭
She loved the ride.
She hardly cried at all.

940
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:33,532
把行李拿进来吧
好的
- Bring in the suitcases.
- OK.

941
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:37,573
妈--嗯,
我每天都要和你聊天
- Mom...
- Well, I talk to you every day.

942
01:22:40,084 --> 01:22:43,418
妈妈,你看起来很好
你看起来很糟糕
- Mother, you look great.
- You look terrible.

943
01:22:43,504 --> 01:22:47,502
没人要一个精疲力尽的女孩的
Nobody wants a girl
who's washed-out and tired-looking.

944
01:22:48,467 --> 01:22:50,674
我刚开了1000公里路
I just drove about 1,000 miles.

945
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:53,928
还有,男人喜欢
我的生活方式
Besides, all the men
love me the way I am, Mother.

946
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:58,012
当你最终迈开了
离开佛莱普的一小步,就像你了
It's like you, when you finally take
one small step away from Flap,

947
01:22:58,102 --> 01:23:03,938
是和结婚,不可能,
又略老的衣阿华,嗯?
it's with a married,
unavailable, older lowan, hmm?

948
01:23:05,526 --> 01:23:08,148
讲讲宇航员吧
Tell me about the astronaut.

949
01:23:08,237 --> 01:23:09,862
我们必须谈谈
We have to talk about it.

950
01:23:09,947 --> 01:23:13,233
你现在要去睡觉了
还是我们一起聊聊天？
Are you going to sleep now,
or are we gonna talk?

951
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,836
宇航员怎么样？
How's the astronaut, Mother?

952
01:23:32,637 --> 01:23:33,965
真的？
Really?

953
01:23:35,431 --> 01:23:37,471
噢,真的吗?
Oh, really?

954
01:23:38,935 --> 01:23:40,559
真的!
Yes!

955
01:23:40,645 --> 01:23:42,637
他可很出名
He has a name, though.

956
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:44,806
你真的很喜欢他
You really like him.

957
01:23:45,483 --> 01:23:47,274
是的
Yeah.

958
01:23:48,069 --> 01:23:50,394
嗯,那就像--
Well, it's just so...

959
01:23:52,281 --> 01:23:56,149
太奇怪了,这来得--
It's so strange that relatively...

960
01:23:56,244 --> 01:24:01,285
如此地晚,
我才发现性是如此--
Relatively late in life,
I've found that sex is so...

961
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:05,908
如此--
如此--
so... so...

962
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:08,044
如此--
so...

963
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:12,128
如此地美妙绝伦!
...so fan-fucking-tastic!

964
01:24:12,218 --> 01:24:15,172
不管怎样,
那是他称呼的方式
Anyway, that's what he calls it.

965
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:36,196
飞蛾扑火般
A moth to flame.

966
01:24:38,953 --> 01:24:41,361
这感情会杀了我的
This affair is going to kill me.

967
01:24:42,498 --> 01:24:45,369
不,也许不会
你为什么这么说?
No. Maybe not. Why do you say that?

968
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:49,918
振作点,妈
Come on, Mom.

969
01:24:50,006 --> 01:24:53,505
我从未想过
我会开始需要他
I never thought
I'd start to need him.

970
01:24:57,221 --> 01:24:59,843
你太幸运了,
能有这么个游泳池
You're so lucky you have a pool.

971
01:25:07,815 --> 01:25:10,187
来吧,站在那里
站在那里!
Come on, stand there. Stand there!

972
01:25:15,531 --> 01:25:17,571
好的
好的
- OK.
- OK.

973
01:25:17,658 --> 01:25:20,778
谈谈洛杉矶
你想念那城市吗?
Let's talk about Los Angeles.
Do you miss it?

974
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:28,285
在离婚后和犹太人
约会太有趣了
It was so interesting
dating Jews after the divorce.

975
01:25:28,377 --> 01:25:30,002
他们太可爱了
They are so lively.

976
01:25:30,087 --> 01:25:32,210
真的?
是啊
- Really?
- Yeah.

977
01:25:32,548 --> 01:25:34,956
在洛杉矶,
他们那么急着
In Los Angeles, they were so anxious

978
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:38,336
证明他们比其他人
更懂得你的小秘密
to show they understood
your secret thoughts.

979
01:25:38,429 --> 01:25:42,130
佩特西!
我很高兴我有好多小秘密
- Patsy!
- And I was just glad I had some.

980
01:25:42,266 --> 01:25:45,137
亲爱的,你的电话
Honey, there's
a telephone call for you.

981
01:25:46,896 --> 01:25:48,011
你好
Hello.

982
01:25:49,106 --> 01:25:50,933
噢,嗨, 佛莱普
你好吗?
Oh, hi, Flap. How are you?

983
01:25:52,109 --> 01:25:53,936
我很好
I'm fine.

984
01:25:57,365 --> 01:26:00,781
像其他人那样,我看起来变老了
她没有
- I look older, like everyone else.
- She does not.

985
01:26:02,328 --> 01:26:06,491
佛莱普, 你还是那意思
我不认为那是好事
Flap, you sound the same and I'm not
sure that's such a good thing.

986
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:09,581
是的,她在这里
Yeah, she's right here.

987
01:26:10,503 --> 01:26:14,002
不,除了你,
我们有其他东西可谈
No, we have other things
to talk about besides you.

988
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,797
喂?
Hello?

989
01:26:22,014 --> 01:26:23,425
我没事
I'm fine.

990
01:26:25,476 --> 01:26:28,643
怎么了?
要痛改前非?
What's up? Feeling contrite?

991
01:26:30,856 --> 01:26:34,060
看起来你还没明白
我看到你们在一起
You don't seem to understand.
I saw you together.

992
01:26:35,444 --> 01:26:37,567
什么?
What?

993
01:26:38,739 --> 01:26:42,654
你知道的,
我难以相信你对我们做了这些
You know, Flap, I can't believe
you're doing this to us.

994
01:26:44,537 --> 01:26:46,944
我觉得你太坏了
Well, I think you're spiteful,

995
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:50,408
我不知道那是在什么时候发生的
and I don't know
when the hell that happened.

996
01:26:51,752 --> 01:26:55,003
不! 再见,我要--
再见
No! Goodbye. I'll... Goodbye.

997
01:27:04,891 --> 01:27:09,967
佛莱普接受了
那份大学系主任的工作
下星期我们搬家
Flap accepted the job at Kearney,
Nebraska. We're moving in a week.

998
01:27:10,062 --> 01:27:12,102
我不明白你为什么不离开他
I don't know why you don't leave him.

999
01:27:12,189 --> 01:27:15,808
老实说,我也不知道
他很可爱
Honestly, I don't know, either.
He's cute.

1000
01:27:37,048 --> 01:27:39,717
整个礼拜我都在整理东西
I've been packing for us all week.

1001
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:51,145
还记得她爸爸
Sure remembers her daddy.

1002
01:27:53,147 --> 01:27:55,603
你还生气吗?
So, are you gonna stay mad?

1003
01:27:55,691 --> 01:28:00,437
没得到我允许前搬家
我该发点小脾气吧,难道不对吗?
I think being uprooted without my
consent is worth a pout, don't you?

1004
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:07,984
算了吧
Come on.

1005
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:10,451
系主任
我知道
- Head of the department.
- I know.

1006
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:12,164
这里
Here.

1007
01:28:18,464 --> 01:28:22,592
奥罗拉?
盖瑞特,我回来了
- Aurora?
- Garrett! I'm back here.

1008
01:28:24,053 --> 01:28:26,544
嘿,你好啊,陌生人
Well, hello, stranger.

1009
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,881
两天过得怎么样?
What's it been, about two days?

1010
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:33,343
你家人还在?
Your family still around?

1011
01:28:34,021 --> 01:28:36,061
不,已经走了
No, they left.

1012
01:28:39,902 --> 01:28:41,729
什么?
What?

1013
01:28:54,917 --> 01:28:59,460
你可能知道我要说什么
You probably know
what I'm going to say.

1014
01:29:00,756 --> 01:29:04,339
不,也许不知道
我不希望知道
Oh, maybe not. I hope not.

1015
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:10,512
嗯,
Well...

1016
01:29:11,225 --> 01:29:17,098
你是那一类女人,
而我可能不是那一类男人,
You're some kind of woman,
but I'm the wrong kind of man,

1017
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:21,982
看起来我所追求的那一类
and it doesn't look like my shot
at being the right kind is...

1018
01:29:22,069 --> 01:29:25,106
不是正如我所想的
as good as I was hoping for.

1019
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:31,869
你不明白我有多想你
You don't even know how much
you'll miss me.

1020
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:35,577
我不想把你踢飞
I don't want to blow smoke
up your ass.

1021
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:39,711
噢!这是怎么种解脱
Oh! What a relief.

1022
01:29:41,589 --> 01:29:45,587
这只是开始让我
觉得要担起责任来
It's just that I'm starting
to feel an obligation here.

1023
01:29:45,676 --> 01:29:50,006
感觉很难,
尤其是当邻居
It makes it rough,
especially living next door.

1024
01:29:50,097 --> 01:29:53,763
我开始思考
我得注意我的一举--
I'm starting to think
I gotta watch what I'm doing...

1025
01:30:09,283 --> 01:30:12,735
我会想念你
I... I am gonna miss you...

1026
01:30:14,038 --> 01:30:16,078
我感觉很糟糕
and I do feel bad.

1027
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:23,626
你很幸运
You're lucky.

1028
01:30:24,757 --> 01:30:26,880
我感觉被羞辱了
I feel humiliated.

1029
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,736
能要一张照片吗?
Can I have a picture of you?

1030
01:30:54,829 --> 01:30:57,746
是的,但我只有一张照片了
那里面也有佛莱普
Yeah, but the only one I have
has Flap in it.

1031
01:30:57,832 --> 01:30:59,706
没关系
I don't mind.

1032
01:31:20,563 --> 01:31:22,602
来,亲我一口
Come here, give me a kiss.

1033
01:31:55,389 --> 01:31:58,426
当你完成后,
我需要这类的磁带
When you finish,
I need this kind of type.

1034
01:31:58,517 --> 01:32:01,554
你好, 艾玛
嗨,宝贝
Hello, Emma. Hi, baby.

1035
01:32:02,521 --> 01:32:05,095
她想她爸爸看她穿好衣服的样子
She wanted her daddy
to see her dressed up.

1036
01:32:05,191 --> 01:32:07,267
他随时都会到
He'll be here any minute.

1037
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,518
一会我再和你谈
好的
- I'll talk to you later.
- OK.

1038
01:32:13,115 --> 01:32:14,526
对不起
Excuse me.

1039
01:32:23,834 --> 01:32:26,408
小姐?
Miss?

1040
01:32:26,504 --> 01:32:28,247
小姐?
Miss?

1041
01:32:37,473 --> 01:32:40,924
别让我一直追着你
我有个小孩
Don't make me run after you,
I have a toddler here!

1042
01:33:05,293 --> 01:33:08,543
你是我们来
内布拉斯加的原因吗?
Are you the reason
that we came to Nebraska?

1043
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:12,002
我想那应该
由佛莱普来回答你
I think that Flap should talk to you.

1044
01:33:13,259 --> 01:33:15,382
我们谈谈吧
We discussed that.

1045
01:33:15,469 --> 01:33:19,218
在他和你谈之前,
我不想和你说话,除非我认为
I don't want to say anything
until he does, except that

1046
01:33:19,307 --> 01:33:24,549
你们之间不再有感情
但我现在无法确认
I don't think there's an emotion
you're having I couldn't... validate.

1047
01:33:31,736 --> 01:33:33,645
告诉你
Tell you what.

1048
01:33:33,738 --> 01:33:37,237
如果你见到佛莱普,
告诉他,他妻子和孩子
If you see Flap,
tell him his wife and his baby

1049
01:33:37,325 --> 01:33:39,650
去打针了,好吗?
went to get their flu shots,
all right?

1050
01:33:39,744 --> 01:33:41,783
你为什么不那样做?
Why don't you do that?

1051
01:33:46,959 --> 01:33:48,833
就这样保持
Just hold still.

1052
01:33:50,213 --> 01:33:51,623
乖孩子
That's a good girl.

1053
01:33:51,714 --> 01:33:55,249
好了?都完了吗
结束了
OK? You're all finished.
It's all over.

1054
01:33:56,260 --> 01:34:00,388
如果你觉得好些了,
轮到妈咪了
If it makes you feel any better,
Mommy's getting a shot, too.

1055
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:03,964
她能吃泡泡糖吗?
可以
- Can I give her a pop?
- Sure.

1056
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,432
这边
去一边玩吧
- Here.
- There you go.

1057
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:11,976
如果我丈夫打电话来,
他们会告诉我吗？
Are they gonna tell me
if my husband calls?

1058
01:34:13,569 --> 01:34:15,728
你手臂上有硬块
You have a lump in your armpit.

1059
01:34:15,821 --> 01:34:18,739
多久了?
我不知道
- How long has it been there?
- I don't know.

1060
01:34:18,824 --> 01:34:21,113
梅尔尼,别去踢柜子!
Melanie, stop kicking the cabinet!

1061
01:34:21,202 --> 01:34:24,653
有两个,
但都不算大
There's two of them.
It's not very big, though.

1062
01:34:24,747 --> 01:34:28,496
我要离开城里,
但你不能再等下去
I have to be out of town next week
but you shouldn't wait.

1063
01:34:28,584 --> 01:34:30,162
它们应该被取出来
They should come out.

1064
01:34:30,253 --> 01:34:33,337
取出来?
我该为此担心吗?
Come out? Should I be scared?

1065
01:34:33,422 --> 01:34:39,212
如果你担心,
那么你会高兴
发现其实什么事也没有
If you're scared, you'll be happier
when it turns out to be nothing.

1066
01:34:39,303 --> 01:34:43,799
布吉医生,
妈妈也该奖励块泡泡糖
Dr Butch, Mom should get a pop, too,
for her shot.

1067
01:34:44,892 --> 01:34:48,178
对给,妈咪
谢谢, 梅尔
- Right. Here, Mom.
- Thanks, Mel.

1068
01:34:48,813 --> 01:34:50,687
我知道这是什么
Well, I know what it is.

1069
01:34:50,773 --> 01:34:54,391
你的毛囊堵塞
You don't keep yourself up
so your sweat glands are clogged.

1070
01:34:54,485 --> 01:34:56,644
这是胞囊
那么我就不需要担心了?
- It's a cyst.
- So I shouldn't worry?

1071
01:34:56,737 --> 01:34:59,655
是胞囊,
就在脂肪腺边上
It's a cyst,
right where your oil glands are.

1072
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:04,449
你吃的东西不对,
也没学会该怎么洗
You never knew how to eat right
and you've never learned how to wash.

1073
01:35:04,537 --> 01:35:07,158
你是对的,谢谢
和梅尔尼讲几句
You're right. Thanks.
Talk to Melanie.

1074
01:35:07,248 --> 01:35:08,825
说"嗨",
嗨!
- Say hi.
- Hi.

1075
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:11,751
你好
我给你邮了衬衣
Hello, how are you?
I sent you a blouse.

1076
01:35:11,836 --> 01:35:13,627
说"再见"
再见!
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

1077
01:35:13,713 --> 01:35:18,624
好说--
代我向妈咪告别
OK. Say good...
Say goodbye to your mother.

1078
01:35:26,225 --> 01:35:28,052
她叫什么名字?
What's her name?

1079
01:35:28,144 --> 01:35:31,643
珍妮丝。
医生怎么说?
Janice. What did the doctor say?

1080
01:35:31,731 --> 01:35:36,856
告诉你, 佛莱普
他想尽快把它取出来
I told you, Flap. It's scary
that he wants to do it so fast.

1081
01:35:36,944 --> 01:35:39,518
珍妮丝, 拿着小文件夹
Janice... with her little folder.

1082
01:35:39,614 --> 01:35:44,026
"除非他说了,否则我什么也不说
我们已经讨论过了,佛莱普和我"
"I can't say anything until he does.
We've discussed it, Flap and I."

1083
01:35:44,118 --> 01:35:48,116
真的吗, 佛莱普!
"验证我的感觉"
你的品味!
I mean, really, Flap!
"Validate my feelings." Your taste!

1084
01:35:48,205 --> 01:35:51,409
但是医生说--
把它取出来感觉会更好
What the doctor said,
feeling good when it turns out...

1085
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:55,083
不!忘了它吧,
我不会让你好受的!
我太生气了
No! Forget it, I won't make you
feel better, I'm too mad.

1086
01:35:55,171 --> 01:35:56,998
开饭!
Dinner!

1087
01:36:12,813 --> 01:36:16,645
亲爱的,你得了--
- 恶性的
Dear, you have a malignancy.

1088
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:25,159
再说一遍?
-恶性的
- Say it again?
- Malignancy.

1089
01:36:28,746 --> 01:36:33,242
罗西,
我们的女儿遇上麻烦了
Rosie... our girl is in trouble.

1090
01:36:33,334 --> 01:36:35,955
她得了恶性肿瘤
She has a cyst that's malignant.

1091
01:36:36,045 --> 01:36:40,588
他们把她带去
在林肯的一家医院
They're taking her to a hospital
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

1092
01:36:47,265 --> 01:36:49,756
我们会让她
回家几天
We'll release her in a few days.

1093
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:53,266
我们会好好护理她的
We do more and more
on an outpatient basis.

1094
01:36:53,354 --> 01:36:56,937
除非肿瘤扩大,
她都无需回医院
We shouldn't need to take her back,
unless the illness escalates.

1095
01:36:57,024 --> 01:36:59,100
但你什么也没告诉我
But you're not telling me anything.

1096
01:36:59,193 --> 01:37:01,731
你对什么还不明白?
What are you confused about?

1097
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:04,442
她怎么样了？
How is she?

1098
01:37:04,532 --> 01:37:08,446
我告诉大家做最好
做最坏的打算
I tell people to hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

1099
01:37:10,413 --> 01:37:12,701
他们让你如此悲观?
And they let you get away with that?

1100
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:18,335
瞧,你这么悲观是不对的
Look, you're wrong to see everything
as so desperate and serious.

1101
01:37:18,421 --> 01:37:22,715
这给艾玛没有什么意义
And it won't do your daughter any
good to get those signals, either.

1102
01:37:28,472 --> 01:37:30,845
现在还有什么问题？
What's wrong now?

1103
01:37:31,517 --> 01:37:35,431
我对那医生生气
你有点过于伤悲了
I'm so frustrated with that doctor.
But it boils down to this.

1104
01:37:35,521 --> 01:37:39,389
你没必要再呆在这里
You're getting out and
you don't have to stay here again.

1105
01:37:39,483 --> 01:37:43,184
除非肿瘤扩大
我一点都不觉得自己生病了
Unless the illness spreads.
I really don't feel sick.

1106
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:47,775
嘿,艾玛
去纽约吧,我请你
Hey, Emma. Come to New York
for a visit. My treat.

1107
01:37:48,618 --> 01:37:52,567
好极了我们得看看
看看这封来自孩子们的信
Great. We'll have to see.
Look at these letters from the kids.

1108
01:37:52,663 --> 01:37:56,328
泰迪说他睡不着,
但梅尔尼可以
Teddy says he couldn't sleep,
but Melanie slept fine.

1109
01:37:57,168 --> 01:38:01,379
汤米觉得没有
什么需要担心的--
Tommy thinks there's nothing
to be concerned about...

1110
01:38:01,464 --> 01:38:04,999
嘿,我是认真的!
在你看医生之前你还有时间
Hey, I mean it! You have
time before you see the doctor.

1111
01:38:05,092 --> 01:38:08,010
来看看纽约
Come see New York for a few days.

1112
01:38:09,138 --> 01:38:12,139
不是个坏主意,
对你而言只是休下假
It's not a bad idea,
a vacation by yourself.

1113
01:38:12,225 --> 01:38:14,134
罗西和我
还有孩子们都在这里
Rosie and I are here with the kids.

1114
01:38:14,227 --> 01:38:17,975
利用你的空闲时间
我知道你希望去
- Take advantage of your freedom.
- I know you wanna go.

1115
01:38:18,731 --> 01:38:23,274
这和把孩子们带去
迪斯尼乐园不同
This isn't like taking those kids
to Disneyland right before the end?

1116
01:38:23,361 --> 01:38:24,771
住嘴!
Stop!

1117
01:38:25,488 --> 01:38:27,694
哦,对不起
佩特西,我开玩笑的!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Patsy, I'm kidding!

1118
01:38:33,955 --> 01:38:36,825
你觉得离开
孩子们好玩吗?
Do you feel funny
about leaving the kids?

1119
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:40,415
我没有离开他们,我只是把
他们委托给他们的父亲
I'm not leaving them,
I'm entrusting them to their father.

1120
01:38:41,671 --> 01:38:45,620
哦,虽然我不会像你母亲
和罗西在城里那么长时间
Oh, I thought as long as your mother
and Rosie are in town...

1121
01:38:45,716 --> 01:38:48,587
不是他们,是你
Not them. You.

1122
01:38:59,272 --> 01:39:03,519
艾玛!看哪! 看哪! 看哪!
我们到了吗?
- Emma, look! Look! Look!
- Are we there yet?

1123
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:07,227
天哪！真不敢相信!我在这里
很漂亮,不是吗？
- Oh, God! I can't believe I'm here!
- Isn't it beautiful?

1124
01:39:07,321 --> 01:39:11,615
我希望你见见我的朋友
没什么好友像我和你这样
I want you to meet some of my
friends. Not friends like you and I.

1125
01:39:14,412 --> 01:39:16,737
嗨
嗨
- Hi.
- Hi.

1126
01:39:16,831 --> 01:39:18,823
艾玛,这是莉兹白
Emma, this is Lizbeth.

1127
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:22,202
嗨, 伊丽莎白
嗨,莉兹白
- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi. It's Lizbeth.

1128
01:39:22,295 --> 01:39:26,755
你说, "伊丽莎白"
实际上这是莉兹白
- Isn't that what I said?
- You said "Elizabeth". It's Lizbeth.

1129
01:39:26,841 --> 01:39:31,302
哦,两个名字?莉兹 白?
不,一个 莉兹白
- Oh, two names? Liz Beth?
- No, one. Lizbeth.

1130
01:39:31,387 --> 01:39:33,925
莉兹 白?
没关系!
- Lizbeth?
- Never mind.

1131
01:39:34,015 --> 01:39:37,218
这是简
谢天谢地!
- And this is Jane.
- Thank heavens!

1132
01:39:40,104 --> 01:39:41,812
这儿,那是梅尔尼
Here, that's Melanie.

1133
01:39:41,898 --> 01:39:44,898
噢!
看看那!
Oh! Look at that!

1134
01:39:44,984 --> 01:39:48,151
泰迪是年纪小的,
另一个是汤米
Teddy's the younger one,
Tommy's the older one.

1135
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:54,654
那小女孩,太不可思议了
别以为她不知道
- The little girl's incredible.
- Don't think she doesn't know it.

1136
01:39:54,744 --> 01:39:58,788
哦,佩特西要好好照顾她
男孩子们也一样
Oh, Patsy's got a real thing
going with her. The boys, too.

1137
01:39:58,873 --> 01:40:02,076
哦,你要在再次工作前
等到她回学校吗?
Are you waiting till she's in school
before working again?

1138
01:40:02,168 --> 01:40:04,540
我从未真正意义上工作过
Oh, I never really work.

1139
01:40:05,713 --> 01:40:08,002
嗯,那就好
Well. That's OK.

1140
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:09,917
谢谢
Thanks.

1141
01:40:13,137 --> 01:40:14,631
太好了!
Great.

1142
01:40:18,267 --> 01:40:21,054
她什么时候发现的?
When did she find out?

1143
01:40:21,145 --> 01:40:24,395
一个月前
- About a month ago.
- There.

1144
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:30,525
怎么了？
没事
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1145
01:40:30,613 --> 01:40:34,278
见到你很高兴
玩得开心点
It was a great honour meeting you,
have a wonderful time.

1146
01:40:34,367 --> 01:40:35,529
谢谢
Thank you.

1147
01:40:35,618 --> 01:40:39,912
那些可爱的孩子们很幸运
有你这样一位母亲
Those beautiful children are lucky
to have you for a mommy.

1148
01:40:39,997 --> 01:40:42,453
你们先走,打车去吧
Y'all go ahead, take the first cab.

1149
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:44,997
确定吗?
嗯那很好
- Sure?
- Yeah. That's fine.

1150
01:40:45,086 --> 01:40:47,043
再见, 佩特西
再见
- Bye-bye, Patsy.
- See you.

1151
01:40:47,129 --> 01:40:49,667
再见,亲爱的
Bye, darling.

1152
01:40:52,552 --> 01:40:56,383
你告诉她们了,不是吗?
是的,你不介意吧？
- You told them, didn't you?
- Yeah, you don't mind, do you?

1153
01:40:56,472 --> 01:40:58,761
当然不介意
Of course not.

1154
01:41:00,268 --> 01:41:03,933
艾玛,算了吧,
她们是垃圾
她们什么也不懂
Emma, come on. They're jerks.
They don't know anything.

1155
01:41:04,021 --> 01:41:07,307
你干嘛这么说?
艾玛,告诉我!
- Why do they act like that?
- Emma, talk to me!

1156
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:11,611
这不是你
我不在意他们知道
It's not you. I don't care.
I don't mind them knowing.

1157
01:41:13,906 --> 01:41:19,411
在至少两个小时里,
她们其中两个告诉我
她们堕过胎
In less than two hours, two of them
told me that they'd had abortions.

1158
01:41:19,495 --> 01:41:22,033
三个说离过婚
Three of them told me
they were divorced.

1159
01:41:22,123 --> 01:41:25,207
一个和她母亲几年没说过话
One hasn't talked to her mother
in four years.

1160
01:41:25,293 --> 01:41:28,827
还有一个把她的娜塔莉
放在寄居学校
And the one that has little Natalie
in a boarding school

1161
01:41:28,921 --> 01:41:31,459
就因为她工作需要出差?
because she has to travel
for her job?

1162
01:41:31,549 --> 01:41:33,376
天哪,佩特西,!
Hell, Patsy!

1163
01:41:33,467 --> 01:41:39,303
那得了酵母菌的家伙
以为她得了性病?
Oh, the one with the yeast disease
that thought she had vaginal herpes?

1164
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:42,426
如果那是午餐合适的话题,
If that's fit conversation for lunch,

1165
01:41:42,518 --> 01:41:46,682
我的小肿块又算得上
什么可怕的事情呢?
what's so god-awful terrible
about my little tumours?

1166
01:41:47,523 --> 01:41:52,066
嗯 ,当然,但是--
你要我怎么做?
Yeah, of course, but...
what do you want me to do?

1167
01:41:52,153 --> 01:41:55,652
告诉她们这不是
什么悲惨的事情!
I want you to tell them
it ain't so tragic!

1168
01:41:57,325 --> 01:41:59,697
人人都会好起来的
People do get better.

1169
01:42:00,953 --> 01:42:03,824
告诉她们,
谈谈癌症没关系!
Tell them it's OK
to talk about the cancer!

1170
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:12,788
佩特西告诉我们
你患上癌症
Patsy tells us you have cancer.

1171
01:42:15,927 --> 01:42:17,753
我们得谈谈
We should talk later.

1172
01:42:17,845 --> 01:42:21,973
我是营养学家,
我丈夫在Ticketron工作
I'm a nutritionist,
and my husband's with Ticketron.

1173
01:42:23,184 --> 01:42:25,260
谢谢 佩特西
Thanks, Patsy.

1174
01:42:25,353 --> 01:42:29,647
你好
佛莱普?你听说什么了吗?
- Hello.
- Flap? Have you heard anything?

1175
01:42:29,732 --> 01:42:33,350
没有
艾玛也没给你打过电话,嗯？
No. Emma hasn't
called you either, then, huh?

1176
01:42:33,444 --> 01:42:35,733
没有
孩子们怎么样了?
No. How are the children?

1177
01:42:35,821 --> 01:42:38,941
我希望我什么都不管才好
I wish I were so carefree.

1178
01:42:39,033 --> 01:42:42,983
是的,还好,
他们没什么要感到羞愧的
Yes, well, they don't have
anything to feel ashamed about.

1179
01:42:43,079 --> 01:42:46,911
你知道些什么?
对我你总是要发脾气
You know something? You always
lose your manners around me.

1180
01:42:46,999 --> 01:42:49,288
住嘴, 佛莱普
听我说
Stop it, Flap.
Let me know if you hear.

1181
01:42:49,377 --> 01:42:52,046
如果你和艾玛说话,
别像现在这样紧张
If you talk to Emma,
don't sound so frightened.

1182
01:42:52,129 --> 01:42:54,703
我一点也不紧张!
I don't sound... frightened!

1183
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:59,917
爸爸
Daddy.

1184
01:43:08,187 --> 01:43:12,849
嗨,妈妈,他们为我开party,
我不能说很长时间
Hi, Mother. They're having this party
for me so I can't talk very long.

1185
01:43:12,942 --> 01:43:16,145
我想我会提早回来的
But I think I'm coming home
a few days early.

1186
01:43:18,155 --> 01:43:19,270
还没有
Not really.

1187
01:43:22,994 --> 01:43:25,698
该是我们用这个
房间的时候了
It's about time
they gave us this room.

1188
01:43:25,788 --> 01:43:29,038
妈,难以置信
你布置了这些
Mother, I can't believe you did this.
It's great.

1189
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:34,000
小心！它们可是很值钱的
你一辈子也挣不回来
Careful! These are worth more
than you'll make in your lifetime.

1190
01:43:34,088 --> 01:43:37,872
我一生和她相伴
你可以用一段时间
I grew up with it, you can take it
for a couple of minutes.

1191
01:43:37,967 --> 01:43:41,051
真不错,
真的要谢谢你
This is fine. Thank you so much.

1192
01:43:42,388 --> 01:43:45,057
好的,谢谢
Thank you.

1193
01:43:47,768 --> 01:43:50,176
噢,
它们看起来太漂亮了
Oh, they're wonderful!

1194
01:43:50,271 --> 01:43:52,560
尤其是放在一起
They look good next to each other.

1195
01:44:01,365 --> 01:44:05,233
帮我一下, 梅尔尼
漂亮可不是一切啊
Help me with this, Melanie.
Gorgeous isn't everything.

1196
01:44:05,328 --> 01:44:08,198
这个,这个
再要两个
This one, this one... two more.

1197
01:44:14,003 --> 01:44:17,419
我们尝试的药物的效果
The response to the drugs we tried...

1198
01:44:18,549 --> 01:44:20,542
和我们预想的不同
isn't what we hoped.

1199
01:44:20,635 --> 01:44:26,139
我们还有试验性
药品想使用
There are investigatory drugs
which we are willing to utilise.

1200
01:44:26,224 --> 01:44:29,178
不过,如果你
身体状态不好
However, if you become incapacitated,

1201
01:44:29,268 --> 01:44:33,847
或者你觉得
无需这样医治,
or it becomes unreasonable for you
to handle your affairs for a time,

1202
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:39,278
你最好现在就做决定
it might be wise
to make some decisions now.

1203
01:44:44,033 --> 01:44:46,702
还有问题吗?
Any questions?

1204
01:44:46,786 --> 01:44:48,825
没有
No.

1205
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:54,657
我明白你的意思
I know what you're saying.

1206
01:44:54,752 --> 01:44:58,251
我得想想该
怎么告诉孩子们
I have to figure out
what to do with my kids.

1207
01:45:19,986 --> 01:45:23,770
对不起,
已经10:00以后了,
给我女儿打止痛针
Excuse me. It's after ten.
Give my daughter the pain shot.

1208
01:45:23,864 --> 01:45:25,774
格林威妈妈, 
我会的
Mrs Greenway, I was going to.

1209
01:45:25,866 --> 01:45:28,192
好的,快点
稍微等一下
- Good. Go ahead.
- Just a few minutes.

1210
01:45:28,286 --> 01:45:30,278
求你了已经10:00
Please. It's after ten.

1211
01:45:30,371 --> 01:45:33,158
我不明白
为什么她要得这病?
I don't see why
she has to have this pain?

1212
01:45:33,249 --> 01:45:37,116
妈妈,
这不是我的病人
这是时候了!
做事!
- Ma'am, It's not my patient.
- It's time! Do something!

1213
01:45:37,211 --> 01:45:39,916
她就需要坚持到10点!
All she has to do is
hold on until ten!

1214
01:45:40,006 --> 01:45:44,217
已经过了10:00了!
我女儿她很痛!
And it's past ten!
My daughter's in pain!

1215
01:45:44,302 --> 01:45:46,793
给我女儿打针!
你们打不打?
- Give her the shot!
- Are you going to behave?

1216
01:45:46,888 --> 01:45:49,343
快给我女儿打针!
GIVE MY DAUGHTER THE SHOT!

1217
01:45:53,519 --> 01:45:55,927
谢谢谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1218
01:46:02,403 --> 01:46:04,645
给我222房间钥匙,谢谢
Can I have 222, please?

1219
01:46:29,055 --> 01:46:32,009
去抓住她!
我把外婆推进水中!
- Let's get her!
- I'm pushing Grandma in!

1220
01:46:32,099 --> 01:46:34,341
你们敢!
我说真的
Don't you dare! I mean it.

1221
01:46:36,062 --> 01:46:37,260
来吧
Come on.

1222
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:42,976
说, ""外婆好"'
外婆好
- Say, "Hi, Granny."
- Hi, Granny.

1223
01:46:43,069 --> 01:46:45,108
奥罗拉?
Aurora?

1224
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:19,096
嗯,
Well...

1225
01:47:20,398 --> 01:47:24,526
谁能想到你是个好人?
Who would have expected you
to be a nice guy?

1226
01:47:38,207 --> 01:47:39,832
谁?
Who?

1227
01:47:41,085 --> 01:47:43,125
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

1228
01:47:58,102 --> 01:48:01,685
保重
我会给你打电话
Take care of yourself. I'll call you.

1229
01:48:06,444 --> 01:48:08,935
我能来我感到很高兴
I'm real glad I came.

1230
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:11,900
对艾玛而言意义重大
Your coming meant a lot to Emma.

1231
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:14,743
对我也一样, 盖瑞特
It meant a lot to me, Garrett.

1232
01:48:14,827 --> 01:48:17,947
我整天都会呆在医院,
我会给你打电话
I'll be at the hospital all the time,
I'll call you.

1233
01:48:18,039 --> 01:48:22,250
不,如果那里有其他什么人,
我能从你话里听到那有趣的声音
No, if there's someone there, I'll
hear that funny sound in your voice.

1234
01:48:22,335 --> 01:48:24,956
我不在乎
谁在意?我不在乎
I don't care.
Who cares? I don't care.

1235
01:48:25,046 --> 01:48:27,287
很高兴你能来,
我爱你
I'm glad you came, I love you.

1236
01:48:45,608 --> 01:48:46,604
盖瑞特!
Garrett!

1237
01:48:47,902 --> 01:48:49,894
盖瑞特!
Garrett!

1238
01:48:49,987 --> 01:48:52,027
到这边来
Come here.

1239
01:48:56,077 --> 01:48:57,904
我是认真的
I was curious.

1240
01:48:57,995 --> 01:49:01,115
对我告诉你
我爱你有什么反应呢？
Do you have any reaction
to my telling you I love you?

1241
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:06,789
这离分别只有一寸之距
I was just inches
from a clean getaway.

1242
01:49:06,879 --> 01:49:09,121
你呆了一下,面对吧
Well, you're stuck, so face it.

1243
01:49:12,385 --> 01:49:16,429
我不知道除了
呆一下还能说什么
Well, I don't know what else to say
except my stock answer.

1244
01:49:16,514 --> 01:49:18,091
哪些?
Which is?

1245
01:49:19,267 --> 01:49:21,758
我也爱你,宝贝
I love you, too, kid.

1246
01:49:42,623 --> 01:49:44,248
再见
Goodbye.

1247
01:49:53,634 --> 01:49:56,588
我送他到机场
我们站在那里
At the airport,
we were standing there

1248
01:49:56,679 --> 01:50:01,305
拥抱,然后吻别,
in front of the door hugging
and kissing, and saying goodbye.

1249
01:50:01,392 --> 01:50:04,428
你知道吗?
什么?
- And you know what?
- What?

1250
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:08,304
我告诉他我爱他
I got up the nerve
to tell him I loved him.

1251
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:10,439
你知道他怎么反应的吗?
You know what his reaction was?

1252
01:50:10,526 --> 01:50:13,563
想不出来,
妈妈,我病了
I don't give a shit, Mom, I'm sick.

1253
01:50:17,617 --> 01:50:21,614
不是每件事都关于你的,
我有太多事情要想
Not everything is about you,
I've got a lot to figure out.

1254
01:50:23,831 --> 01:50:28,576
我不想再抗争下去了
你什么意思?我们什么时候抗争过?
- I just don't wanna fight any more.
- What do you mean? When do we fight?

1255
01:50:30,546 --> 01:50:32,586
我们什么时候抗争过？
你吓着我了
When do we fight? You amaze me.

1256
01:50:32,673 --> 01:50:36,173
我一直以为我们在抗争
I always think of us as fighting.

1257
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,300
那是你的想法
That's from your end.

1258
01:50:38,387 --> 01:50:41,673
那是因为你从来
没有对我满意过
That's cos you're
never satisfied with me.

1259
01:51:43,953 --> 01:51:47,653
今天见过她了吗?
见过,
- Have you seen her yet today?
- Yes.

1260
01:51:47,748 --> 01:51:51,663
我从昨晚起一直
陪着她
I've been with her most of
last night and today, as usual.

1261
01:51:52,962 --> 01:51:57,588
我没有,嗯
真正和孩子们谈过
I haven't, uh...
really talked to the kids yet.

1262
01:51:58,759 --> 01:52:01,048
我不知道
他们了解了多少
I'm not sure how much they realise,

1263
01:52:01,137 --> 01:52:03,758
但他们知道有些
不好的事情发生了
but they know
something bad's happening.

1264
01:52:03,848 --> 01:52:06,054
佛莱普
Flap...

1265
01:52:06,142 --> 01:52:08,181
佩特西
想抚养梅尔尼
Patsy wants to raise Melanie

1266
01:52:08,269 --> 01:52:10,475
也许还有那两个男孩
and maybe the boys.

1267
01:52:10,563 --> 01:52:12,769
我想他们
应该和我在一起
I think they should be with me,
don't you?

1268
01:52:13,858 --> 01:52:16,100
你在想什么?
What can you be thinking about?

1269
01:52:16,193 --> 01:52:21,270
抚养三个孩子,
白天上班,还要追女人
Raising three children,
working full time and chasing women

1270
01:52:21,365 --> 01:52:23,572
你的精力不够
requires a lot more energy
than you have.

1271
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:26,233
你知道,
你的优点在于
You know, one of the
nicest qualities about you

1272
01:52:26,329 --> 01:52:29,365
你能认识到自己的缺点
is that you recognise
your weaknesses.

1273
01:52:29,457 --> 01:52:32,660
别把这优点丢掉
当你最需要这优点时
Don't lose that quality
when you need it the most.

1274
01:52:38,424 --> 01:52:43,169
你没有权利
或者任何邀请
You have no right,
nor any invitation,

1275
01:52:43,262 --> 01:52:48,220
来讨论我的孩子该在哪里以什么方式生活
to discuss where
or how my children live.

1276
01:53:06,827 --> 01:53:11,371
医生说了
该是我们谈谈的时候了
From what the doctor says,
it's time that we have the talk now.

1277
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:16,076
你知道我有多讨厌去想
会失去你吗?
Do you know how much I hate
the idea of losing you?

1278
01:53:18,589 --> 01:53:20,582
知道
Yes.

1279
01:53:20,675 --> 01:53:25,917
嗯--除了你
看起来没有人了解了
Well, nobody...
Nobody seems to know that except you.

1280
01:53:27,139 --> 01:53:28,764
我只是-- 嗯
I... Well...

1281
01:53:28,849 --> 01:53:30,509
什么?
What?

1282
01:53:31,811 --> 01:53:36,022
我在考虑我的身份
而现在却失去了那身份
I'm thinking about my identity,
and not having one any more.

1283
01:53:36,107 --> 01:53:39,024
我是谁,如果我不是
放弃艾玛的男人?
Who am I, if I'm not the man
who's failing Emma?

1284
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:42,443
你没有放弃我,佛莱普
我不想讨论这个话题
- You didn't fail me, Flap.
- I don't wanna discuss it.

1285
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:46,528
我感觉我想原谅你,
或许我已经那么做了
I feel like I'm sucking after
forgiveness, which I probably am.

1286
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:50,662
你没我看起来那么糟糕
You were no more terrible than I was.

1287
01:53:50,746 --> 01:53:53,035
除了骗我
Except for the cheating.

1288
01:53:54,959 --> 01:53:58,292
你说对了
我们别这样做
You're right. Let's not do this.

1289
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:01,254
瞧,我们之间有问题
Look, we had problems.

1290
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:04,626
我们是否爱着对方的
讨论永远不会结束
It was never over
whether we loved each other.

1291
01:54:08,472 --> 01:54:11,592
哦,天哪！这领带！
Oh, God! That tie!

1292
01:54:11,684 --> 01:54:14,555
难以相信你还带着它!
I can't believe you wore that!

1293
01:54:14,645 --> 01:54:17,101
找到这条领带一定很难
The mess it must've been finding it.

1294
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:22,184
家里仍然一团糟,这是我从
找的最后一个盒子里发现的
The house still isn't in one piece.
It was in the last box I looked in.

1295
01:54:22,278 --> 01:54:24,317
我敢打赌
I'll bet.

1296
01:54:25,406 --> 01:54:27,612
上帝,你很好哄
God, you're easy to please.

1297
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:30,903
我不知道
我干嘛不多做点什么呢？
I don't know why
I couldn't do more of it.

1298
01:54:33,205 --> 01:54:35,779
我很高兴我们在聊天,
只是指我
I'm so glad we're talking, I just am.

1299
01:54:35,875 --> 01:54:40,453
这对我意义重大,
我们仍然能像现在这样
It just means so much to me that
we can still feel like this, so much.

1300
01:54:40,546 --> 01:54:42,918
我发誓
I swear...

1301
01:54:46,928 --> 01:54:49,383
听着,我累了
Listen, I am getting tired.

1302
01:54:50,848 --> 01:54:54,264
只需告诉我,
你真的想抚养他们？
Just tell me, hon,
you really want to raise 'em?

1303
01:55:07,365 --> 01:55:11,908
我从未想过放弃孩子
I never thought I was the sort of man
who'd give up his kids.

1304
01:55:11,994 --> 01:55:14,070
这是份很累的工作
It's a lot of work.

1305
01:55:15,206 --> 01:55:19,535
既然你觉得这是很艰难的事,
那就别希望那会简单
As hard as you think it is,
you end up wishing it were that easy.

1306
01:55:21,712 --> 01:55:23,539
你希望他们在哪里呢？
Where do you want them?

1307
01:55:23,631 --> 01:55:26,383
我不想让珍妮丝来带他们
I don't want them
to end up with Janice.

1308
01:55:29,095 --> 01:55:31,171
嗯,她并没那么糟糕
Well, she's not so bad.

1309
01:55:37,019 --> 01:55:40,602
我也不认为他们该和你在一起,
亲爱的
I really don't think
they should be with you, honey.

1310
01:55:46,445 --> 01:55:48,687
嗯,
Well...

1311
01:55:49,824 --> 01:55:52,231
实话告诉你,
To tell you the honest truth...

1312
01:55:54,370 --> 01:55:56,410
我可能把事情搞得一团糟
I'd probably screw it up.

1313
01:56:00,501 --> 01:56:02,743
我真的很想念他们
I'll really miss them.

1314
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,671
嗯,也许我们应该
让佩特西带他们
Well, maybe we should let
Patsy take them.

1315
01:56:10,761 --> 01:56:15,673
对我而言
夏天在纽约做研究会简单些
It'd be easy for me to work
research summers in New York.

1316
01:56:15,766 --> 01:56:21,009
不,佩特西只是想抚养梅尔尼
身为母亲,应该抚养他们
No. Patsy really only wants Melanie.
Mother should have them.

1317
01:56:22,523 --> 01:56:24,765
你随时可以去见他们
You can see them any time you want.

1318
01:56:24,859 --> 01:56:27,480
你该为他们决定一切
You'll decide things
for them and everything.

1319
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:29,693
她会觉得那很难
She can make that very difficult.

1320
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:31,939
她不会
She won't.

1321
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:40,367
嗯,我想他们最好
还是由你母亲抚养吧
Well, I guess they should be
with your mother.

1322
01:56:41,626 --> 01:56:43,832
我也许会那样做的
I probably have that coming.

1323
01:57:02,063 --> 01:57:05,977
佛莱普, 明天能把
男孩们带来吗？
Flap, will you bring
the boys by tomorrow?

1324
01:57:06,067 --> 01:57:09,436
那已经在等我了
我得完成该完成的
I've got that one waiting for me.
I gotta do it.

1325
01:57:10,529 --> 01:57:12,937
好的
谢谢
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

1326
01:57:23,918 --> 01:57:26,670
来吧,佩特西
我得做好准备
Come on, Pats, I gotta get ready.

1327
01:57:26,754 --> 01:57:29,708
佩特西
化妆!
Patsy. Make-up!

1328
01:57:33,844 --> 01:57:36,964
这样说是不是太糟糕了
我无法忍受看你母亲
Is it terrible to say
I can't stand seeing your mother

1329
01:57:37,056 --> 01:57:39,096
爱抚那小女孩?
get her hands on that little girl?

1330
01:57:39,183 --> 01:57:42,184
我只是想抚养那小女孩
I'd just love to raise
that little girl.

1331
01:57:47,608 --> 01:57:49,648
听着,我会让你抚养的,
Look, I'd let you,

1332
01:57:49,735 --> 01:57:52,357
但泰迪不能离开她
but Teddy couldn't spare her.

1333
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:55,736
我不能再拖了,行吗?
I can't stall any more, all right?

1334
01:57:55,825 --> 01:57:58,909
你出去,
把孩子们叫进来吧
You go out there
and send the boys in.

1335
01:57:58,995 --> 01:58:01,320
嗯,我需要说点什么吗？
Well, do I get to say something ever?

1336
01:58:01,414 --> 01:58:02,528
不用
No.

1337
01:58:06,002 --> 01:58:09,453
我们没必要那样做,对吗?
过来
We don't have to do that, right?
Come here.

1338
01:58:14,093 --> 01:58:16,584
你会好的
会的
You'll be fine. You will.

1339
01:58:22,351 --> 01:58:24,178
就这些
It's just this...

1340
01:58:27,982 --> 01:58:30,307
你是我的榜样, 艾玛
You're my touchstone, Emma.

1341
01:58:32,612 --> 01:58:34,438
男孩们
The boys.

1342
01:59:17,281 --> 01:59:20,033
嗨
进来吧
Hi. Come on.

1343
01:59:20,409 --> 01:59:25,404
我爱你我想念你,
我要你回家
I love you. I miss you.
God, I want you to come home.

1344
01:59:26,624 --> 01:59:28,533
把门关上
Close the door.

1345
01:59:28,751 --> 01:59:31,538
天哪,你们看起来
都长大了
God, you both look so gigantic to me.

1346
01:59:32,922 --> 01:59:35,543
我猜我吓着你们了
I guess I look pretty bad to you.

1347
01:59:35,633 --> 01:59:37,672
没那么糟糕
Not so bad.

1348
01:59:41,597 --> 01:59:45,547
你们俩都有漂亮的眼睛
你们头发太长了
You both have beautiful eyes
and your hair's too long.

1349
01:59:45,643 --> 01:59:49,094
我不想管的,但
把头发剪了,好吗？
I don't care about the back
but keep your bangs cut, OK?

1350
01:59:49,188 --> 01:59:52,438
太长了
这只是观念问题
- It's too long.
- That's a matter of opinion.

1351
01:59:52,525 --> 01:59:55,194
留短发,好吗?
Just keep it short, all right?

1352
01:59:55,278 --> 01:59:57,104
你好点了吗?
Are you getting well?

1353
02:00:01,450 --> 02:00:02,993
抬头
Look up.

1354
02:00:03,077 --> 02:00:06,078
很包歉,
我对此无能为力
I'm sorry about this
but I can't help it.

1355
02:00:06,163 --> 02:00:09,164
我不能说太久,要不我会太悲伤的
I can't talk too long
or I'll get real upset.

1356
02:00:11,794 --> 02:00:14,830
我要你们结交朋友
I want you to make a lot of friends.

1357
02:00:14,922 --> 02:00:20,925
对女孩们好些
因为她们会对你们很重要,
我发誓
And be real nice to the girls cos
they'll be important to you, I swear.

1358
02:00:21,012 --> 02:00:24,630
我们不害怕和女孩交往
什么使你那样想?
We're not afraid of girls,
what makes you think that?

1359
02:00:24,724 --> 02:00:27,475
以后也许会,
我不相信
- Well, you may be later on.
- I doubt it.

1360
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:30,644
你干嘛不闭嘴?
闭嘴!
你给我闭嘴!
- Why don't you shut up? Shut up!
- You shut up.

1361
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:33,600
泰迪,亲我一口
过来
Teddy, give me a kiss, come on.

1362
02:00:37,486 --> 02:00:40,404
汤米, 乖点
乖
Tommy, you be sweet. Be sweet.

1363
02:00:42,325 --> 02:00:46,239
别假装你还恨着我
这样做很愚蠢
And stop trying to pretend
like you hate me. It's silly.

1364
02:00:47,705 --> 02:00:49,330
我爱你
I like you.

1365
02:00:49,415 --> 02:00:52,784
那就好好听着
什么?
- Then listen especially close.
- What?

1366
02:00:52,877 --> 02:00:55,119
认真听?
我所说的
- Listen real hard?
- I said what.

1367
02:00:57,757 --> 02:01:00,462
我知道你喜欢我
我知道
I know you like me. I know it.

1368
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:06,549
去年或前两年,
你装作恨我
For the last year or two,
you've pretended like you hate me.

1369
02:01:08,226 --> 02:01:12,437
但我非常爱你
就像我爱其他人一样爱着你
But I love you very much,
as much as I love anybody,

1370
02:01:12,521 --> 02:01:14,810
就像爱惜我自己一样
as much as I love myself.

1371
02:01:14,899 --> 02:01:19,810
过些年,当我不再纠缠你
And in a few years when I haven't
been around to irritate you,

1372
02:01:19,904 --> 02:01:22,193
你会记得
you're gonna remember.

1373
02:01:22,281 --> 02:01:27,572
你会记得我给你买棒球手套,
记得我们吵架,
You'll remember when I bought the
baseball glove when we were broke

1374
02:01:27,662 --> 02:01:29,785
或者我给你读故事
or when I read you those stories,

1375
02:01:29,872 --> 02:01:34,368
又或者我让你出去玩,
而不是去割草－－太多事情
or when I let you goof off instead
of mowing the lawn, lots of things.

1376
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:38,327
你会发现你爱着我
You're gonna realise
that you love me,

1377
02:01:38,422 --> 02:01:43,084
也许你会觉得很糟糕,因为你
没有告诉过我,但不要那样认为
and maybe you'll feel badly because
you never told me, but don't.

1378
02:01:45,471 --> 02:01:47,511
我知道你爱着我
I know that you love me.

1379
02:01:50,393 --> 02:01:54,141
所以不要那样做,
好吗?
好的!
- So don't do that to yourself, OK?
- OK!

1380
02:01:55,690 --> 02:01:58,477
好吗?
我说了,好的!
- OK?
- I said OK.

1381
02:02:01,988 --> 02:02:03,945
很好,
你们要自力更生
OK, you two should run along.

1382
02:02:04,031 --> 02:02:05,858
保重
Take care.

1383
02:02:07,952 --> 02:02:09,612
来,亲我一口
Give me a kiss.

1384
02:02:13,374 --> 02:02:17,586
我很害怕,但
我想我会好起来的,不是吗?
I was so scared,
but I think it went well, don't you?

1385
02:02:19,297 --> 02:02:21,289
嗯?
Yeah?

1386
02:02:33,686 --> 02:02:37,518
汤米,如果你想找人聊天
爸爸会认真听的
Tommy, if you need to talk,
your dad will listen.

1387
02:02:37,607 --> 02:02:40,477
他很聪明,
你知道的
He's a very smart man, you know.

1388
02:02:41,152 --> 02:02:45,944
就那样说,"爸爸,我感到困惑,
我需要和你谈谈"
Just say, "Dad, I'm confused.
I need to have a talk."

1389
02:02:50,036 --> 02:02:53,701
你知道的,
和我一起住的男孩
You know, I met this boy back in
River Oaks where I live.

1390
02:02:53,789 --> 02:02:57,372
告诉我休斯顿童子军是最好的
He said the Cub Scouts in Houston
are the best ever.

1391
02:02:57,460 --> 02:03:01,707
我们从没当过童子军
我们的妈妈懒得去管这些
We were never scouts, our mother
was too lazy to check it out.

1392
02:03:03,424 --> 02:03:05,417
别跑了! 停下!
No! Stop!

1393
02:03:06,469 --> 02:03:08,508
来吧!
别跑了!
Come on! Stop it!

1394
02:03:08,596 --> 02:03:10,007
别跑了!
No!

1395
02:03:10,097 --> 02:03:14,095
听我说!听我说!
行了, 汤姆
Listen to me! Listen. It's OK, Tom.

1396
02:03:14,185 --> 02:03:18,977
没事了
嘿!停下!
It's OK. Now...
Hey! Stop it!

1397
02:03:19,982 --> 02:03:25,024
对不起,
我无法忍受听到
尤其批评你母亲
I'm sorry, but I just can't have you
criticising your mother around me.

1398
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:39,137
霍顿先生
霍顿先生
Mr Horton. Mr Horton?

1399
02:04:39,228 --> 02:04:41,268
她走了
She's gone.

1400
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:11,838
天哪,我太蠢了
我太蠢了
Oh, God, I'm so stupid. So stupid...

1401
02:05:11,928 --> 02:05:13,303
我以为--
Somehow I thought...

1402
02:05:13,387 --> 02:05:17,006
以为她走的那一刻,
Somehow I thought
when she finally went,

1403
02:05:17,099 --> 02:05:19,590
就是一种解脱
that it would be a relief.

1404
02:05:20,978 --> 02:05:23,849
噢,我的小甜心!
Oh, my sweet, little darling!

1405
02:05:31,322 --> 02:05:35,818
噢, 亲爱的
没比这更难的了
没有--
Oh, dear. There's nothing harder.
There's nothing...

1406
02:05:47,129 --> 02:05:48,956
要蛋糕吗?
Do you want some cake?

1407
02:06:05,189 --> 02:06:09,057
你干嘛站在这里?
我不知道
- Why are you standing over here?
- I don't know.

1408
02:06:10,486 --> 02:06:13,357
想和我坐一起？
You wanna come over and sit with me?

1409
02:06:19,370 --> 02:06:22,454
一切都会好起来的, 汤米
Everything's gonna be
all right, Tommy.

1410
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:44,633
啊,在休斯顿
有一流的舞蹈学校
There's fantastic
dance schools in Houston.

1411
02:06:44,729 --> 02:06:49,604
击打乐?
击打乐,芭蕾,杂技--
- Tap?
- Tap, ballet, aerobics...

1412
02:06:50,693 --> 02:06:52,567
你想要的一切
Anything you want.

1413
02:06:52,653 --> 02:06:54,860
到这边来看你爸爸
Come over here and see your dad.

1414
02:06:54,947 --> 02:06:58,399
他认识一个漂亮的女孩
不是吗?
He really knows a pretty girl,
doesn't he?

1415
02:06:58,492 --> 02:07:00,532
对他而言她太老了
She's too old for him.

1416
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:05,744
你想吃野兔肉吗?
到爸爸那里去吃
Are you eating a wet bunny? Here.
Better go on over to Dad and eat it.

1417
02:07:17,178 --> 02:07:20,013
嗨, 佛恩
最近怎么样啊?
Hi, Vern. How are you doing here?

1418
02:07:41,994 --> 02:07:43,738
嗨,
Hi.

1419
02:07:48,042 --> 02:07:50,711
我知道你是游泳好手
I understand you're a swimmer.

1420
02:07:51,963 --> 02:07:53,789
我也是
Me, too.

1421
02:07:53,881 --> 02:07:57,167
但你是宇航员,
不是吗?
But you're an astronaut, right?

1422
02:07:57,260 --> 02:08:00,344
我是宇航员,
又是游泳好手
I'm an astronaut and a swimmer.

1423
02:08:03,391 --> 02:08:05,798
很好看的西装啊
Pretty good-looking suit, there.

1424
02:08:07,937 --> 02:08:10,854
坐近点再近点
A little closer. A little closer.

1425
02:08:11,482 --> 02:08:13,309
再近点
A little closer.

1426
02:08:13,442 --> 02:08:15,898
想看看我的泳池吗?
Do you want to see my pool?

1427
02:08:17,029 --> 02:08:21,608
我不知道现在是否是合适的时机--
你知道的,葬礼还有一切--
I don't know if the time is right.
You know, funeral and everything.

1428
02:08:21,701 --> 02:08:24,951
噢,我想是吧
来吧
Oh, I think it is. Come on.

1429
02:08:25,037 --> 02:08:30,992
我会向你展示世界上最著名的
啊, 空中漫步
I'll show you the internationally
infamous... uh... Breedlove crawl.

1430
02:08:31,085 --> 02:08:34,703
在太空里学会的
Just a little stroke
I picked up out in space.
