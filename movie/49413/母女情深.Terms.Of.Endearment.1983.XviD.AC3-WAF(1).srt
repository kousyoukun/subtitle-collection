1
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,695
Let me go, just for a minute.

2
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:21,781
You're going to stare that baby
into a coma.

3
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:23,908
Stop exaggerating.

4
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:28,329
It's not good to keep checking
and imagining terrible things.

5
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:32,959
- I know, I know.
- Here it starts. Here we go.

6
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:36,254
Rudyard...
Rudyard, she's not breathing.

7
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:39,424
Honey, she's sleeping.
The baby's sleeping.

8
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,925
No...

9
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:45,597
- Rudyard, it's crib death.
- It's sleep!

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,975
- She's asleep, honey.
- Maybe.

11
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,227
Come on!

12
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,278
Emma.

13
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:02,864
Oh, good.

14
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:07,827
That's better.

15
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,525
No, thank you.

16
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:44,113
Thanks. Emma?

17
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:50,161
He was one of the most dependable men
that ever worked for me.

18
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:53,748
- I know. Thank you.
- He was a good man.

19
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:03,466
I'm real sorry about your daddy.
Take care of your momma.

20
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:55,560
Emma? Emma, wake up, please.

21
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,313
- Wake up.
- What's wrong?

22
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:03,401
I was tense and I was wondering
how you were feeling.

23
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:07,447
- Would you like to sleep in my bed?
- No, thank you.

24
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:10,742
Would you like to sleep
in my bed again?

25
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,243
Yes!

26
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:40,271
What are we going to do
with this hair?

27
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,318
Hey, Emma!

28
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:51,908
Patsy, hurry up!
You're going to miss him.

29
00:03:56,996 --> 00:04:00,291
Oh, that's what they were looking at!

30
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,798
- Good night, honey.
- Where's Momma?

31
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,550
That old fart's trying
to get in her pants.

32
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:13,763
- What if the astronaut shows up?
- Oh, they're everywhere in Houston!

33
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:18,309
- Say hi to Race.
- OK. Love ya. Astronauts!

34
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:24,440
So?

35
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:29,028
- We better get going.
- I'll say goodbye. Want to go with?

36
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:32,824
No. I don't think I'm up to it today.

37
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:37,036
Sure would be nice
to have a mother somebody liked.

38
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:51,634
Why don't you accept the fact that
you have certain biological needs?

39
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,765
- Because I don't.
- Mom! I'm going now.

40
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,308
Excuse me.

41
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:07,358
Can you believe it?
He wants to take me to Tahiti.

42
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:13,698
I don't know why you treat these men
like this. They have feelings too.

43
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,701
- Has the astronaut moved in yet?
- Who?

44
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:20,413
Patsy teaching you coy lessons?
Breedlove. Has he moved in?

45
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:24,000
- Put your socks up!
- Say goodbye to Patsy.

46
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,752
- Be home by eleven.
- Say goodbye to Patsy.

47
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:29,547
- Goodbye, Patsy!
- Thank you.

48
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:44,353
In this day and age, anything goes!

49
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:14,425
I feel really foolish getting stoned
to hear Mary Martin.

50
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,428
See, Patsy...

51
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:21,724
This is not Mary Martin,
this is Ethel Merman.

52
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:36,322
This is the last time
we're gonna be like this.

53
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:41,952
I just plain refuse
to get into that kind of thinking.

54
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,872
It should not stop.

55
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:47,083
I mean, we're gonna be best friends.

56
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,668
Our babies will be best friends.

57
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:52,129
We'll all be best friends.

58
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:54,840
Oh, God!

59
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:57,093
- Just a minute.
- Open the door.

60
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,513
Emma, open the door.

61
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:02,014
Just a minute.

62
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,601
- I need to talk to you!
- All right.

63
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:08,687
I'm getting married. What the hell?

64
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:17,154
- Meet me in my room?
- Yes.

65
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:23,577
- What do you think she wants?
- Maybe to tell you how to have sex.

66
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:27,790
What?! No. She only knows
how to avoid it.

67
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,294
I can't believe you said that.

68
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:35,256
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it, I swear.

69
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:47,560
What have you been doing, Emma?

70
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:49,520
Nothing.

71
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,107
What is it, Momma?

72
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,070
I really want to get some sleep so
I look halfway decent for tomorrow.

73
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:03,117
Come on. What is it?

74
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,789
Would you want me to be silent
about something for your own good?

75
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:10,916
Yes, ma'am, I would!

76
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,267
OK, come on.

77
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,273
Come on.

78
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:52,791
I've been in here all night.

79
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:58,088
I've been trying to decide what...
what wedding gift to get you.

80
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:04,511
I thought of that Renoir
that my mother gave me.

81
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,850
But I couldn't reach a conclusion.

82
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:14,521
Then I came to grips with the reason
why I couldn't think of a gift.

83
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:20,944
Oh, Momma, it's all right.
I need dishes, a rotisserie...

84
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,072
The car... the house...

85
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,620
I'm totally convinced
if you marry Flap Horton tomorrow,

86
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,748
it will be a mistake
of such gigantic proportions,

87
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:36,627
it will ruin your life
and make wretched your destiny.

88
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:40,756
Why are you doing this to me?

89
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:46,095
You are not special enough
to overcome a bad marriage.

90
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,725
Use your brains.

91
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:55,062
Flap is limited.
He hasn't got any imagination.

92
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:58,690
Even at this age, all he wants
is a secure teaching job.

93
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,192
Mother...

94
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:03,237
I'm marrying Flap Horton tomorrow.

95
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,031
I thank God
Flap's getting me out of here.

96
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:10,369
If this is your attitude,
don't come to my wedding.

97
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:16,416
That's right.

98
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:19,670
No, I think you're right.

99
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,881
The hypocrisy was bothering me, too.

100
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:35,060
My own mother's
not coming to my wedding.

101
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:07,551
Listen to her. She's going crazy.

102
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,137
I'll give her until noon tomorrow.

103
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,974
Emma, your mother
boycotted your wedding,

104
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:18,353
she hates your husband
and only holds you in medium esteem.

105
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,731
Medium esteem.

106
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:25,193
That is so cute. That is so cute.

107
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:33,660
Wouldn't it have been strange
to marry a person who didn't read?

108
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:40,000
There's millions of interesting
people who never pick up a book.

109
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:50,302
Flap, I feel so totally good about
us. I hope I get pregnant tonight.

110
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,763
That would be nice.

111
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,857
I love the way you look.

112
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:11,114
You're so nice.

113
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:17,120
I... You're my sweet-assed gal.

114
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:01,915
Here comes the bride!

115
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,925
Wait, Flap. Where did you learn
how to do that?

116
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,347
That is the strangest
music to make love to.

117
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,266
I know.

118
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:33,864
Leave me alone. I'm happy.
I don't want to talk to you.

119
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:38,160
No. Did you see the tablecloth
Rosie gave me?

120
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:41,538
It's beautiful.
It's got red flowers on it.

121
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:45,709
She made it. No, not yet.

122
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:50,589
Home-made omelettes.
Just ordered 'em. Kinda Tex-Mex.

123
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:55,177
No. That was the worst thing
you've ever done to me, Mother!

124
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:59,598
Well, I think you owe my husband
an apology.

125
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:03,310
Until you apologise,
I'm not listening to your gossip.

126
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:06,855
No. Well, he's right here.

127
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,025
Hold on.

128
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,237
Yes. Yes.

129
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,619
Hello, Mrs Greenway.

130
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:23,788
No, ma'am, I am not
enjoying your predicament.

131
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,040
Momma, be nice!

132
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:30,045
As a matter of fact,
I don't need or desire an apology.

133
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:34,966
All I want is for you to understand
and appreciate my position,

134
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:38,845
to respect our marriage,

135
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,808
and to wait another 15 minutes
before you call in the morning.

136
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,898
Yes, I guess I've said my piece.

137
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:52,609
OK, I'll put her on.

138
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,695
He's so great!
I'll talk to you later.

139
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,705
I don't care about the neighbourhood.

140
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:08,667
Can't you stay a little while longer?

141
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:14,589
I thought we were having
a real good time, didn't you?

142
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:17,133
Listen, don't go yet.

143
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:21,930
One more minute.
I've got something to show you.

144
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,848
No, really.

145
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,651
- Thanks.
- Good night.

146
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,800
- I bought you something.
- What?

147
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:04,848
A tie.

148
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,687
You didn't buy this for me.

149
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,107
You were worried about
how I'd look to your mother.

150
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,985
Stop being a quisling
where she is concerned.

151
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:19,571
Whenever I get happy,
you turn perverse.

152
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:23,908
- Buying this tie made you happy?!
- Yes! Yes!

153
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:28,413
I wish you could understand,
cos you really don't.

154
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:31,666
It made me very happy,
buying this tie.

155
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:34,544
I went to two or three places.

156
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:40,258
Then describing your jacket, knowing
it would match what you're wearing,

157
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:44,304
which, by the way, it certainly does.

158
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,514
I mean, it was fun!

159
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,228
It was a goddamn mardi gras and
you're too dumb to understand that!

160
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,772
I'm sorry. I'm being terrible.

161
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:58,651
Going to your mother's,
it makes me a little irrational.

162
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,658
Can I help?

163
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:07,118
Yes. Thank you, Flap.

164
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:10,455
Take this candle. I need another one.

165
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:12,624
- In the kitchen?
- Yes.

166
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,751
That looks great.

167
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,428
Who's that short gentleman?

168
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:32,060
Not that it's any of your business...
Just leave it at that.

169
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:49,118
What are you looking at?
She isn't there any more.

170
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,245
She'll be back.

171
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:54,499
I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend.

172
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:58,628
Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart.

173
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:03,466
God, isn't she something?
Here she comes.

174
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,928
I met her two weeks ago at church.

175
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:11,182
You might say she's God's gift
to Vernon Dahlart.

176
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,936
Then you like her?

177
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:18,189
Oh, no. Does it show?

178
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,610
Good food.

179
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,782
Well, this is what I used to serve
when I lived in Boston.

180
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,952
Vernon, you haven't said a word.

181
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:34,664
Is that right? I feel like
I haven't stopped talking.

182
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:39,460
I guess because
I've been thinking about you so much.

183
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:43,047
Can I suggest how to handle me?

184
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:45,049
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,802
Don't worship me
until I've earned it.

186
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:52,265
Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate
any advice you can give me.

187
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:55,101
Don't talk
with your mouth full, Vernon.

188
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,733
I wouldn't do that.

189
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,861
I just did it to make you laugh.

190
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:08,906
What's wrong with you?

191
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,076
I got some good news.

192
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,328
What's that?

193
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:17,290
I'm unofficially pregnant.

194
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:21,919
We haven't gotten the tests back yet,
but you know me, I'm never late.

195
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:24,589
Well...

196
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:26,716
I don't understand.

197
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:35,850
If you're not happy for me,
I'll get so mad if you're not happy.

198
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:47,236
Why should I be happy
about being a grandmother?

199
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:51,782
Does this mean you won't be
knitting any booties?

200
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:55,953
Flap...

201
00:19:57,914 --> 00:20:02,835
Every time you get more than
two drinks in you, you confront me.

202
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,921
And I won't have it.

203
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,257
I won't have it,
not in this house. Excuse me.

204
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,700
Do you need some help?

205
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:39,997
No. I'll be fine
just as soon as I stretch my legs.

206
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:42,833
Oh, God.

207
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,002
Mr Breedlove.

208
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:52,260
You're bleeding.

209
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:55,638
Yeah.

210
00:20:57,598 --> 00:20:59,642
It's OK.

211
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,355
Come on in.

212
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:06,273
No, thank you.

213
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:08,192
What are you afraid of?

214
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,777
Afraid?

215
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,696
Well...

216
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:14,740
Why not...?

217
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,245
Why not come on in?

218
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:22,623
Because you're much older
than the boys I date,

219
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:24,750
cos you're drunk,

220
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:29,964
and because when I went to see
an astronaut give a lecture,

221
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:33,134
I didn't expect him
to prowl after us all night.

222
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:37,513
I didn't expect some silly flirt
who had to keep his jacket open

223
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,849
because his belly's getting too big.

224
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:44,895
I expected a hero.

225
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:02,163
Well, OK, Doris, don't come in.

226
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:04,498
I don't want you in my house.

227
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,961
Lee Anne, would you like to come in?

228
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:11,464
You better tend to that cut.

229
00:22:27,605 --> 00:22:30,524
Tommy, show me your belly.
Come on. Come on!

230
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,781
- How can you dress him like that?
- He's adorable. Look at him.

231
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:45,331
Oh, great, Tommy.

232
00:22:49,877 --> 00:22:51,921
That's Vernon. So tell him I'm...

233
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:55,591
- Out?
- No. Tell him I'm resting.

234
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,052
Hello?

235
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:00,179
Hi, Flap.

236
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:04,808
Where? No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.

237
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:16,362
Oh, Flap, you did not
expect I'd be happy.

238
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:20,157
Let's be honest with each other
before we start pretending.

239
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:25,329
Look, Mom's staring at me right now,

240
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:29,625
so can I talk about it later to you?

241
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,960
Yeah.

242
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,878
All right.

243
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:35,381
Bye.

244
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:50,062
How long you going to
keep this a secret?

245
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:53,565
The only school that would accept
his associate professorship

246
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,818
is in Des Moines.

247
00:23:56,944 --> 00:24:00,030
He can't even do the simple things,
like fail locally.

248
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:04,994
It's gonna be all right, Momma.

249
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,246
It's Des Moines.

250
00:24:07,955 --> 00:24:11,250
- Say, "Bye-bye, house".
- Bye-bye, house.

251
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:22,052
Be careful going down these steps.
Don't break your leg.

252
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:32,354
Come here.

253
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,524
Come here. Come here.

254
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:40,571
Stay sweet, honey.

255
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,281
Rosie...

256
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:46,660
That's enough, Rosie.
They have to get started.

257
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,749
Tell Momma to drive you home when
you work late. Have some fun, Rosie.

258
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:55,627
Don't act so brave. I know you'll go
crazy without me to nag.

259
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:58,005
Be good to her or else we'll get you.

260
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,761
I mean it.

261
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:11,268
Bye, Flap. Have a good drive.

262
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:18,692
OK, fingers and toes in.
Take Momma's purse.

263
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:34,708
Momma, that's the first time
I stopped hugging first.

264
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:36,877
I like that.

265
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:41,006
Get yourself a decent
maternity dress.

266
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,967
You had to get one in, didn't you?

267
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:49,640
Will you tell her, Patsy?
She keeps thinking it's me.

268
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,563
Tom... Are you gonna be good
to your mother and take care of her?

269
00:25:57,898 --> 00:25:59,733
Bye, Mrs Greenway.

270
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:01,485
Goodbye.

271
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:05,155
Write as soon as you get there,
so I'll have your address, OK?

272
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,616
You shape up, Patsy.

273
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,577
Dropped my gum.

274
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:13,121
We'll get you another piece,
sweetheart.

275
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:22,172
The phone bill will be enormous,
you know that?

276
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,885
I'll miss you, Momma.

277
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,644
- Can we go now?
- Yeah. Pull away slow.

278
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,809
Honey, I think it will be good for us
to be away from your...

279
00:27:15,892 --> 00:27:17,519
Our families.

280
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:22,024
- I miss Houston.
- You don't know how lucky you are.

281
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,652
Everybody wants to go to Des Moines.

282
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:28,113
People come from all over the world

283
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:31,074
to get one look at Des Moines
before they die.

284
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:34,411
Some people say
it's the best city in lowa.

285
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,249
I know you're teasing me.
Texas is the best!

286
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,836
Well, I think
you should stop worrying.

287
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,423
We're gonna see
some terrific new things. We are.

288
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:13,408
Would you please, if you will,
hold it down over there?

289
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,535
Sorry, I can't hear you.

290
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,539
Hold it down! Have some respect
for other people's feelings!

291
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:22,000
Come over a little closer.

292
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:26,046
Hey, you in the bush,
I can't hear you!

293
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,899
Sorry, but I just took a sauna.

294
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:49,611
It's hard not to yell when you hit
that cold water.

295
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,657
You're not gonna ignore me
when I speak directly to you?

296
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm not ignoring you.
What am I supposed to say?

297
00:28:57,244 --> 00:29:00,705
OK, It's hard not to yell
when you hit that cold water.

298
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:03,124
Hey, come here.

299
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:08,171
Come here?

300
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:10,715
What is your name?

301
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,093
- Aurora?
- Yes.

302
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:16,930
You want a shock?

303
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:20,267
No, not especially. What?

304
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:29,484
Well... We're going to have
this dinner at...

305
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:32,612
a NASA dinner at the White House.

306
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:36,950
You know, some cosmonauts
and all of us, and...

307
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:40,370
I didn't know who I could take.

308
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:43,373
Cos all the people I flew with,

309
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:47,210
well, their wives are giving me
bitch bites all over my back

310
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:49,671
if I showed up
with my regular girls.

311
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,966
I didn't know anybody old enough,
so I thought,

312
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,844
"Well, I'll ask
my next-door neighbour."

313
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:01,683
Well, anyway,
they cancelled the dinner,

314
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:06,813
but I was really thinking
about asking you out.

315
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:09,566
Seriously. Ain't that a shocker?

316
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:12,235
Yes.

317
00:30:14,404 --> 00:30:18,742
Imagine you having a date with
someone where it wasn't a felony.

318
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,916
What would you have said
if I'd asked you?

319
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:29,878
Seriously.

320
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:35,592
I would have said I'd like to see
the White House.

321
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:38,178
So you would have come?

322
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:44,726
What the hell. You want to have
dinner out some time?

323
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,687
- No, thank you.
- What about lunch?

324
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:51,399
You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot, don't you?

325
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:55,070
You know, there's something
about your manner.

326
00:30:55,153 --> 00:31:00,116
It's like you're trying
to toy with me.

327
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,329
That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.

328
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:07,415
- This is exactly...
- Do you want to play, Aurora?

329
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,752
You wanna go to lunch,

330
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,254
we'll have lunch.

331
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:18,009
If you want to have lunch
in some restaurant

332
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:22,263
to improve the atmosphere in this
neighbourhood, I wouldn't say no.

333
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:27,060
Come here.
We're too far apart to talk.

334
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:42,325
Now... Aurora.

335
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:47,664
Since you've agreed,

336
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,000
why don't we just
forget about the rest?

337
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:55,922
I mean, I know how you feel.
There were countdowns...

338
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,841
when I had my doubts.

339
00:31:57,924 --> 00:32:02,303
I said to myself,
"You agreed to do it.

340
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,973
"You're strapped in...

341
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,891
"and you're in the hands

342
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:11,271
"of something bigger
and more powerful than yourself.

343
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:19,571
"So why not just lay back
and enjoy the ride?"

344
00:32:20,864 --> 00:32:23,741
I'm not going.
There is something wrong with you.

345
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,959
Oh, God, I'm such a shit.

346
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:41,384
- Wait! That must be it.
- Right there? Oh, God!

347
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:44,304
Oh, Flap, it's great.
Is that it, really?

348
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:47,891
- I think that's it.
- Oh, it's great. Isn't that sweet?

349
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,979
- Oh, that was a bump.
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:56,608
- What is that?
- Shall we go see the house?

351
00:32:56,691 --> 00:33:00,069
You stay here.
I'll come round and get you.

352
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:02,363
Come on. Let's get this off.

353
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:06,034
Come on.

354
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,203
Come on.

355
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:14,626
- Sweetheart, did you hurt yourself?
- Nope, not yet.

356
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:18,296
Do you like it? Do you like it?

357
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:23,259
Oh, it's great. Flap, it's great!

358
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:25,678
Oh, my God.

359
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:42,737
Leave the mattress here.
We can sleep here.

360
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,580
I'm really tired.

361
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:12,600
You ever made love in lowa?

362
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:20,691
You know what? Tommy's room
is on the other side of the hall,

363
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:22,610
so we can get noisy.

364
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,823
Good. You get to make your little
high-pitched squeak.

365
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:33,162
Stop it! What about you?
What about you?

366
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:36,249
"Here I come. Here I come again!

367
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:39,460
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

368
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,048
Here I come again.

369
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:45,758
Yes.

370
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,219
Yes.

371
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,682
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

372
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:55,351
You just made me wet.

373
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:59,272
How can you do that with your voice,
just like that?

374
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:02,316
You just make your voice like that.

375
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,154
Oh, God, if Tommy can't hear us,
we can't hear Tommy!

376
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:14,203
- He's fine, mother!
- Don't get pissy, I'll be back!

377
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:48,613
I have papers to grade.
This isn't love, it's selfishness.

378
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:51,991
It's been a week since
we've been together.

379
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:54,493
We've never gone a whole week, Flap.

380
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:59,206
- Sure, we've gone a week.
- Only in the real pregnant months.

381
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,503
You're always getting home so late,
Flap. Oh, forget it. Forget it!

382
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:08,674
Do me a favour. Don't make me feel
silly, I won't make you feel guilty.

383
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:11,427
Fair enough. I have to hurry.

384
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:15,806
Be a good boy.

385
00:36:31,447 --> 00:36:33,282
Emma?

386
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:37,745
I love that you came back. You're
saving our lives by doing this.

387
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,331
I love that you came back, Flap,
I love it!

388
00:36:40,414 --> 00:36:42,541
Tommy, breakfast will be in a minute.

389
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,419
Let's hurry.
I've got to grade those papers.

390
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,546
I'll give everybody a B!

391
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,841
Come on! Wait!

392
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:53,511
Come on, come on!

393
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:49,942
Hello? Hi, Mother.
Could we talk later?

394
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:53,988
I've got to get the boys off and it's
not a good time to be on the phone.

395
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,825
Don't be so inconsiderate.
I'm all set to have a good talk.

396
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,787
You've got almost an hour
to get the boys off. What's wrong?

397
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:04,832
- Nothing.
- Stop here. Tell me what it is.

398
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:11,297
OK, Mother. I need some money.
I need you to loan me some money.

399
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,424
I really need it, so will you?

400
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:19,930
Oh, Mother, please don't be quiet.
You know that was hard for me to ask.

401
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:22,474
You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.

402
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:26,937
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was just thinking.

403
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:28,856
Thinking what?

404
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,983
How much I hate to part with money.

405
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:34,862
I wouldn't have asked if...

406
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:39,033
Don't yell, but I really think
that I may be pregnant again.

407
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,452
Oh! No!

408
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:46,081
Oh, no! And you're going
to have it, I suppose?

409
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:50,586
Yes, of course.
What's happening to you, anyway?

410
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:53,213
Don't act like that's so terrible.

411
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:57,051
Bright young women
are having simple abortions.

412
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,636
"Simple"?

413
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,598
Then they get wonderful jobs.
You can have it in Colorado.

414
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:06,310
I don't know why I tell you anything.
I seem to like you less.

415
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:11,815
You know why? I am the only person
who tells you the truth.

416
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:14,109
Go get dressed.

417
00:39:14,193 --> 00:39:19,365
How will your life get better if you
keep having children with that man?

418
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:22,868
What miracle is going to come along
to rescue you?

419
00:39:24,912 --> 00:39:29,124
Leave me alone. I need the money.
Give me the painting to sell.

420
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:31,251
No! That's your security.

421
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,837
I will not have you
using that for rent!

422
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,549
Let's not do this. All right?

423
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:41,095
All right? I'll talk to you later.

424
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,805
All right?

425
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:49,561
All right. If it would mean that...

426
00:39:49,645 --> 00:39:52,481
No, don't give me the money.
It'd make you crazy.

427
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:54,983
Yes, it would.

428
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:59,029
We'll talk later. You call me
tonight, if you want, all right?

429
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:00,781
Goodbye.

430
00:40:04,827 --> 00:40:06,662
Daddy just got home.

431
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:10,040
Hey, no kidding?
Is it tough being a genius?

432
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:11,959
Boy!

433
00:40:26,473 --> 00:40:31,437
Great news. I know what my topic is.
I have it all figured out.

434
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,448
What's wrong?

435
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,826
Where have you been all night, Flap?

436
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:51,290
I'm sorry. I fell asleep on
that big sofa at the library again.

437
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:54,251
I don't know what's wrong with me.

438
00:40:55,544 --> 00:40:57,379
I'm on to you.

439
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,639
I'm not doing anything.

440
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:10,642
Oh, yes, you are.

441
00:41:10,726 --> 00:41:13,729
We go through this stage
every time...

442
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:16,148
Don't change the subject.

443
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:18,525
What's the subject?

444
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,652
That I'm on to you.

445
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:24,323
You wouldn't try to look so innocent
unless you were guilty.

446
00:41:24,406 --> 00:41:29,661
You'll have to take my word for it.
You have no other choice.

447
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,963
Excuse me.

448
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:46,678
Emma, you... always get
a little paranoid

449
00:41:46,762 --> 00:41:49,056
in your first few months, OK?

450
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,183
Just...

451
00:41:54,728 --> 00:41:56,772
If you are doing something

452
00:41:56,855 --> 00:42:00,150
and you're trying to make me feel
crazy because I'm pregnant,

453
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:03,946
then you may have sunk so low
that you'll never recover.

454
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:08,992
You may have just panicked, Flap,
and trying to save yourself,

455
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:12,621
you've thrown out
your character and principles.

456
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:16,416
The only way to redeem yourself, and
be the man God intended you to be,

457
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,836
is to admit anything you
might have been doing last night.

458
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,090
Cos if you don't do that,
if you don't do that right now,

459
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,217
you are a lost man.

460
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,595
A shell, a bag of shit dust.

461
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:35,185
You've got to tell me.
For us, honey. Come on.

462
00:42:40,065 --> 00:42:41,608
Hello?

463
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,778
Hello, Aurora.

464
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:48,782
How are you?

465
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:51,702
Yes, she is. She's right here.

466
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:53,954
Nice to hear your voice again.

467
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,252
Why don't you get a job
if you're worried about money?

468
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:02,337
What about the baby?

469
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:05,465
It's a great day
when you get tenure!

470
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:09,886
All tenure means is
we won't have enough money forever!

471
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,472
Why don't you ask your mother?

472
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:16,143
- That's convenient for you!
- Go ahead! Call her!

473
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,312
Why should today be any different?

474
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,232
Get on the phone, Emma!
Get on the phone!

475
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:26,361
- Why don't you call?
- Yeah, I'll call Aurora, right(!)

476
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:30,657
Get on the phone! Get on the phone!
Get on the phone, Emma!

477
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:35,746
Get on the phone!
Get on the damn phone!

478
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:41,209
- Mommy said to wait right here.
- Stay if you want.

479
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:57,309
What are you guys doing here? I told
you to wait in front of the house.

480
00:43:57,392 --> 00:43:59,227
Answer me, Tommy.

481
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:01,730
I didn't want people
to think we lived there.

482
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:03,023
What?

483
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:06,276
I didn't want people
to think we lived there.

484
00:44:08,528 --> 00:44:10,572
Cut it out.

485
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,327
OK. You're allowed to say
one mean thing to me a year.

486
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,370
That'll do till you're ten.

487
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,456
You're driving Daddy away.

488
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:24,377
OK, Tommy. Stand up and follow me.
Don't make me hit you on the street.

489
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,379
Hurry up.

490
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,509
I said hurry. Come on!

491
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,097
Forty-four dollars.

492
00:44:45,106 --> 00:44:47,150
Twenty, thirty...

493
00:44:54,783 --> 00:44:57,035
Let's see. That's $38.40...

494
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:59,913
You don't have enough money?

495
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:09,089
I don't have any cheques. I guess
I'll have to put some things back.

496
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:13,009
Can I have the register key?
She doesn't have enough money!

497
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:20,141
It's no big thing.
I brought the wrong purse.

498
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:22,269
Here, take this.

499
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,147
43.75.

500
00:45:30,986 --> 00:45:32,988
41.35.

501
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:37,575
- You said I could have something!
- I won't give her real food.

502
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:39,911
- Give her this.
- No way!

503
00:45:39,995 --> 00:45:42,455
- 40.35.
- Mom!

504
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,625
All right. Here.

505
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,460
40.55.

506
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:56,219
40.75. We're going
in the wrong direction.

507
00:45:56,302 --> 00:45:58,638
Why do you have to be so damn nasty?

508
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:02,183
It's not going to help anything.

509
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:04,894
We're both people, you know?

510
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:08,314
40.75.

511
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,734
I don't need it.

512
00:46:15,864 --> 00:46:18,533
Mrs Horton, I'm Sam Burns
from the bank.

513
00:46:18,616 --> 00:46:21,286
I turned you down on the second
on your house.

514
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:24,831
Oh, of course.
I remember who you are.

515
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:27,500
Can I help you make up
the difference?

516
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,796
Thanks. I'd appreciate it.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

517
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:37,218
You're a very rude young woman.

518
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:41,473
I know Douglas and I doubt he'd want
you treating customers so badly.

519
00:46:41,556 --> 00:46:44,392
I don't think
I was treating her badly.

520
00:46:44,476 --> 00:46:46,936
Then you must be from New York.

521
00:46:54,486 --> 00:46:56,738
- Be careful, Teddy!
- What?

522
00:46:56,821 --> 00:46:58,865
Be careful!

523
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:04,454
- Where's your car?
- Right here.

524
00:47:04,537 --> 00:47:09,501
That was worst time ever. I didn't
know I could get cheered up so fast.

525
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:11,628
- No problem.
- Come on, Mom.

526
00:47:11,711 --> 00:47:13,755
- Wait by the car.
- Come on!

527
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:15,882
- Wait there.
- No!

528
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:18,384
- Wait by the car, honey.
- But...

529
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,971
Wait over by the car, honey!
Over by the car!

530
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:24,307
Now! Now!

531
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,558
Now!

532
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:31,814
Nice boys.

533
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:35,777
You're great with them, too. Really.

534
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:40,448
I think all three of us
are going through a stage.

535
00:47:40,532 --> 00:47:43,701
- Hey, thanks again.
- Oh, no thanks required.

536
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:45,828
I've had a lovely time.

537
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:47,747
Me, too.

538
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,041
I'll get the money back to you.

539
00:47:50,124 --> 00:47:54,504
Oh, don't bother yourself.
Just drop it in the mail.

540
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:57,215
- To the bank?
- Sure.

541
00:47:57,298 --> 00:48:00,093
You could even use
a cheque-by-mail envelope.

542
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:04,138
Or... you could come in.
Whichever.

543
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:06,933
Maybe I'll come in some time.

544
00:48:10,937 --> 00:48:12,981
Well, that'd be fine.

545
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:24,242
- Hey, can I help you with that?
- No, thanks. I'm used to this.

546
00:48:26,452 --> 00:48:30,832
"And so, another birthday
for a gal named Aurora Greenway

547
00:48:30,915 --> 00:48:35,420
"Even though 50,
she still takes my breath away

548
00:48:35,503 --> 00:48:39,465
"Mere mortals just gaze
as she lights up their sky

549
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:43,177
"A heavenly object, a siren's cry"

550
00:48:44,262 --> 00:48:47,181
You're the best. Happy birthday.

551
00:48:49,142 --> 00:48:51,144
Thank you, Edward.

552
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,147
Thank you.

553
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,274
Do you want one, Vernon?

554
00:48:56,357 --> 00:48:58,776
Would you like a kiss?

555
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:03,114
You're not lying about your age,
are you?

556
00:49:04,532 --> 00:49:06,576
Of course not.

557
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:10,204
I thought you were 52.
She's really 52.

558
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:13,374
Come on, how do you expect
to fool a family doctor?

559
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:16,210
- It seems to me she said her age.
- Thank you.

560
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:20,256
The number doesn't matter,
but the effort to conceal it does.

561
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,051
- Why does he keep talking?
- Dr Ratcher...

562
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:25,261
I'm trying to do some good here!

563
00:49:25,344 --> 00:49:28,431
- The way to adjust to old age...
- Doctor...

564
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:31,976
I think you're confused,
being recently widowed and all.

565
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:57,460
You OK?

566
00:50:08,262 --> 00:50:10,723
Let's give her some privacy.

567
00:50:29,617 --> 00:50:32,495
Yeah? The door's open.

568
00:50:33,746 --> 00:50:35,790
Just a minute.

569
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,634
Well, hello.

570
00:50:47,718 --> 00:50:49,345
Hi.

571
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:56,185
I was curious if you still wanted
to take me to lunch.

572
00:50:58,896 --> 00:51:00,982
I wasn't aware that we...

573
00:51:01,065 --> 00:51:03,484
A few years back,
you invited me to lunch.

574
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:05,611
A few years back?

575
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:10,032
I wondered if the invitation
still exists. Would you like to?

576
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,244
Do lunch.

577
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:16,497
- Not dinner, remember. It was lunch.
- Why not? No.

578
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:18,416
Good.

579
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:20,835
When?

580
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:24,880
Tomorrow?

581
00:51:24,964 --> 00:51:27,008
Tomorrow?

582
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:30,594
All right. All right.

583
00:51:32,346 --> 00:51:34,390
Good.

584
00:51:37,018 --> 00:51:38,853
Twelve thirty?

585
00:51:38,936 --> 00:51:40,354
Twelve.

586
00:51:41,188 --> 00:51:43,024
Good.

587
00:52:17,516 --> 00:52:19,560
Thank you.

588
00:52:24,648 --> 00:52:26,067
Thanks.

589
00:52:36,368 --> 00:52:39,538
If you mind the open air,
I could get the top.

590
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:41,665
No. Don't worry.

591
00:52:41,749 --> 00:52:45,461
Grown women are prepared
for life's little emergencies.

592
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:06,482
Us going out together...
Not bad, huh?

593
00:53:06,565 --> 00:53:10,945
Do you think...? Do you think
you could possibly put the top up?

594
00:53:11,028 --> 00:53:13,656
The top's at home in the garage.

595
00:53:27,545 --> 00:53:29,922
Hello, there. How are you?

596
00:53:32,591 --> 00:53:36,136
How are you, Ali?
It's nice to see you.

597
00:53:49,608 --> 00:53:53,696
Fred, that we met at that bar.
He asked me out.

598
00:53:53,779 --> 00:53:57,867
- Oh, God.
- We went to the Cadillac Bar.

599
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:02,788
It's a fun place if you're with
the right people, but I wasn't.

600
00:54:30,024 --> 00:54:33,068
Well... l'm starving!

601
00:54:34,194 --> 00:54:36,614
No hidden meaning in that remark.

602
00:54:37,156 --> 00:54:39,825
Well... Would you like an oyster?

603
00:54:46,832 --> 00:54:48,375
No.

604
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,379
- Thank you.
- It's good.

605
00:54:57,468 --> 00:54:59,720
I think that is extremely rude,

606
00:54:59,803 --> 00:55:03,140
noticing other women
when you're with me.

607
00:55:04,058 --> 00:55:05,893
I...

608
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:09,063
think we're going
to have to get drunk.

609
00:55:09,146 --> 00:55:12,399
I don't get drunk,
and I don't care for escorts who do.

610
00:55:15,527 --> 00:55:17,571
You got me into this.

611
00:55:17,654 --> 00:55:21,658
You're just gonna have to trust me
about this one thing.

612
00:55:21,742 --> 00:55:25,537
You need a lot of drinks.

613
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:27,998
To break the ice?

614
00:55:28,082 --> 00:55:31,502
To kill the bug that you have
up your ass.

615
00:55:35,297 --> 00:55:37,341
May I get you something?

616
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:41,887
Yes, I think I will have some
bourbon, preferably Wild Turkey.

617
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:55,859
Yes?

618
00:55:55,943 --> 00:55:58,695
You're not fun, by any chance,
are you?

619
00:55:58,779 --> 00:56:02,533
I don't really think we should think
about that right now.

620
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:08,205
Impatient boys
sometimes miss dessert.

621
00:56:22,636 --> 00:56:25,139
We both got here at the same time!

622
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:31,728
Hi, Sam. How are you?
It's nice to see you.

623
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:35,440
It's always so nice to see you.
I can hardly believe it.

624
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:37,359
You, too.

625
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:41,363
What I didn't expect
was there to be moments

626
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:45,242
where I'd forget to be scared
someone would see us together.

627
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:47,494
Sam, you don't have to be scared.

628
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:50,831
I mean, contemplating sin
is all we've done, it's OK.

629
00:56:50,914 --> 00:56:55,210
Oh. I'm glad that you've been
contemplating it, too.

630
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:57,421
I didn't know that.

631
00:56:57,504 --> 00:57:01,008
Well, all these lunches,
all this hand holding?

632
00:57:03,218 --> 00:57:06,763
I'm not going back to the bank
this afternoon.

633
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:09,933
I have to go out
and inspect a new house.

634
00:57:10,684 --> 00:57:16,023
It's pretty far out,
and, well... it's empty.

635
00:57:19,693 --> 00:57:24,489
- I gotta pick up my kids at five.
- Oh, OK.

636
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:28,160
Well, I understand.
Look, don't give it a thought.

637
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:34,666
Emma, I haven't made love
to a woman...

638
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:38,545
in almost three years.

639
00:57:39,588 --> 00:57:41,632
How come?

640
00:57:41,715 --> 00:57:44,259
My wife has a disc problem.

641
00:57:45,344 --> 00:57:47,638
And she can't take having...

642
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:49,973
any weight on her.

643
00:57:51,892 --> 00:57:55,520
Sam, I hope you don't mind me
asking you this, but...

644
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:59,691
have you ever thought of
your wife getting on top?

645
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:02,444
Oh, she wouldn't do that.

646
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:04,863
She may surprise you.

647
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:09,493
No, I don't think so.
It would be so unlike her.

648
00:58:09,576 --> 00:58:13,663
- Did you ask?
- About 600 times.

649
00:58:25,675 --> 00:58:27,844
What are you thinking?

650
00:58:27,928 --> 00:58:30,847
Tell me, do you prefer Texas to lowa?

651
00:58:30,931 --> 00:58:35,602
- What were you really thinking?
- Really, that's what I was thinking.

652
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:41,233
I don't know, there seems to be
an absence of wildness, you know?

653
00:58:41,316 --> 00:58:44,069
Even in the people!

654
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:52,035
Well, we're farmers and we talk poor,
because the farmer aspect is

655
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:54,454
"don't let anybody know
you have anything"

656
00:58:54,538 --> 00:58:57,416
and "don't call attention
to yourself".

657
00:58:57,499 --> 00:59:01,795
My wife says... Well, I guess
we shouldn't talk about Dottie.

658
00:59:03,463 --> 00:59:09,469
Wind in the hair! Lead in the pencil!

659
00:59:09,553 --> 00:59:14,474
Feet controlling the universe!

660
00:59:14,558 --> 00:59:17,561
Breedlove at the helm!

661
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:22,691
Just keep pumping that throttle!

662
00:59:22,774 --> 00:59:25,318
Keep giving it that gas!

663
00:59:26,444 --> 00:59:29,739
I see the Gulf of Mexico below me!

664
00:59:29,823 --> 00:59:32,450
I'm not enjoying this!

665
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:34,661
Give it a chance.

666
00:59:35,245 --> 00:59:37,455
I am going to stop!

667
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:39,958
Fly me to the moon!

668
00:59:58,143 --> 01:00:02,188
How are you?
It's not my fault, but I'm sorry.

669
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:07,277
If you wanted to get me on my back,
you just had to ask me.

670
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:26,671
My hand!

671
01:00:26,755 --> 01:00:28,214
Get it out of there!

672
01:00:28,298 --> 01:00:31,259
- I can't! I swear!
- Get it out!

673
01:00:31,343 --> 01:00:33,345
- I swear to God!
- Out!

674
01:00:33,428 --> 01:00:37,223
We were having such a good time
and you had to go do this!

675
01:00:37,307 --> 01:00:41,519
Please, anything!
Bend down! Bend down!

676
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:50,820
- Why did you have to get drunk?
- I am not drunk... any more!

677
01:00:50,904 --> 01:00:53,573
The pain sobered me up.

678
01:01:14,344 --> 01:01:18,890
Emma, this is terrible to ask -
are you thinking about your husband?

679
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:21,017
- I was a little.
- We can go back.

680
01:01:21,101 --> 01:01:25,480
No, Sam. Stop it.
Look, I want to do this.

681
01:01:25,563 --> 01:01:29,526
I'm glad I don't know whether
Flap's been with someone else.

682
01:01:29,609 --> 01:01:33,738
I'd hate to think I was doing this
just to get even.

683
01:01:43,206 --> 01:01:47,001
Oh, just... Look... Great! Fine.

684
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,796
Great!

685
01:01:49,879 --> 01:01:53,758
You're parked in my driveway!
You're breaking the law!

686
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,886
Thank you!

687
01:02:00,932 --> 01:02:02,976
Would you like to come in?

688
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:06,896
I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.

689
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,568
Everything would have been just fine
if you hadn't gotten drunk.

690
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:15,780
I just didn't want you to think
I was like one of your other girls.

691
01:02:15,864 --> 01:02:19,868
Not much danger in that unless you
curtsy on my face real soon.

692
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:23,329
Garrett!

693
01:02:23,413 --> 01:02:29,377
What makes you so insistent
on shocking and insulting me?

694
01:02:30,128 --> 01:02:33,923
I mean, I really hate that
way of talking. You must know that.

695
01:02:34,841 --> 01:02:36,801
Why do you do it?

696
01:02:37,886 --> 01:02:41,139
I'll tell you, Aurora.

697
01:02:41,222 --> 01:02:43,892
I don't know what it is
about you, but...

698
01:02:45,018 --> 01:02:47,061
you do bring out the devil in me.

699
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:57,906
Where are you?

700
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:01,284
In the laundry room
so nobody could hear.

701
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:03,411
Sam, I can't hear you, either.

702
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:08,124
Wait a minute.
We're getting a quieter cycle.

703
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:10,460
- OK.
- Can you hear me now?

704
01:03:10,543 --> 01:03:13,546
- Yeah.
- Good. Is it bad to call?

705
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:16,674
No, I'm in the market
for a little sweet talk.

706
01:03:16,758 --> 01:03:19,677
- Mom, I have to go!
- Just a minute.

707
01:03:19,761 --> 01:03:21,471
- What?
- Really!

708
01:03:23,723 --> 01:03:25,350
Hurry up.

709
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:30,813
- What is it?
- Just how absolutely good I feel.

710
01:03:30,897 --> 01:03:35,568
And even though I'm scared,
and we've committed adultery,

711
01:03:35,652 --> 01:03:37,737
no matter what happens,

712
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,490
I'm just so grateful
to God or the devil

713
01:03:40,573 --> 01:03:45,745
for... letting me
feel this way again.

714
01:03:45,828 --> 01:03:48,831
I'm so glad you told me that.

715
01:03:48,915 --> 01:03:51,584
- Don't flush!
- You told me always to!

716
01:03:51,668 --> 01:03:54,128
Not this time.

717
01:03:54,212 --> 01:03:57,674
- Emma, is it OK? Can you talk?
- No, it's all right.

718
01:03:57,757 --> 01:04:00,176
- Can I hold Melanie?
- Yes.

719
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:06,182
- Honey, is everything OK?
- What?

720
01:04:06,265 --> 01:04:08,810
- Is everything OK?
- Everything's fine.

721
01:04:08,893 --> 01:04:11,062
Oh, yeah. Everything's fine.

722
01:04:11,145 --> 01:04:17,318
An emergency call from Mrs Aurora
Greenway in Houston for Emma Horton.

723
01:04:17,402 --> 01:04:21,239
- Oh, no!
- She does that when the line's busy.

724
01:04:21,322 --> 01:04:25,576
- Will you release?
- Of course. We were just talking.

725
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,870
Talk to you later, Sam. Bye.

726
01:04:30,164 --> 01:04:31,999
Hi. How'd it go?

727
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:34,001
The astronaut is impossible.

728
01:04:34,085 --> 01:04:38,423
An arrogant, self-centred,
and, yes, somewhat entertaining man

729
01:04:38,506 --> 01:04:43,511
who has realised his ambition,
and is at last a spoiled child.

730
01:04:43,594 --> 01:04:48,766
- A match made in heaven.
- Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you?

731
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:52,562
I don't think he wants to have
anything more to do with me.

732
01:04:52,645 --> 01:04:55,982
- Oh, why?
- I don't wanna go into it.

733
01:04:57,734 --> 01:05:00,820
- Cos you wouldn't go to bed?
- On a first date, Emma?

734
01:05:00,903 --> 01:05:06,784
It's hardly a first date.
You've lived next door for 15 years.

735
01:05:06,868 --> 01:05:10,079
- Why not say the real reason?
- What do you mean?

736
01:05:10,163 --> 01:05:12,623
It's been that long
since you've done it.

737
01:05:12,707 --> 01:05:15,960
Shut up! I mean it! Shut up!

738
01:05:16,043 --> 01:05:17,336
Oh, it's just me.

739
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,921
- No.
- Call him!

740
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:21,007
- No! I'm hanging up.
- OK, I'm sorry.

741
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,926
- I'm hanging up.
- Call him now! So long.

742
01:06:31,077 --> 01:06:33,871
- Hello?
- Hello, Garrett.

743
01:06:34,413 --> 01:06:36,457
Yes?

744
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:41,170
Well, I was just sitting
here realising...

745
01:06:41,253 --> 01:06:44,298
realising that
I had never shown you my Renoir.

746
01:06:44,382 --> 01:06:46,008
What are you talking about?

747
01:06:46,092 --> 01:06:50,972
I'm inviting you to come over
and look at my Renoir.

748
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:55,935
- You're inviting me to bed.
- It happens to be in my bedroom.

749
01:06:56,018 --> 01:06:59,271
Is the Renoir under the covers?

750
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:03,651
Don't cackle, Garrett.

751
01:07:04,402 --> 01:07:06,237
Do you want to see it?

752
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,198
Do I want to come to your bedroom?

753
01:07:10,866 --> 01:07:13,828
- Let me think.
- Do you?

754
01:07:13,911 --> 01:07:20,918
Just give me a minute.
It's a tough one.

755
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,883
I guess... I don't know.

756
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:34,515
Yeah, OK. I guess so, sure, why not?

757
01:07:36,392 --> 01:07:38,269
I'll see you in a bit.

758
01:07:38,352 --> 01:07:42,022
If I don't answer the bell,
the back door's open.

759
01:07:42,106 --> 01:07:44,567
The back door's open.

760
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:25,107
My God. He ran it.

761
01:08:56,847 --> 01:08:58,265
Hi.

762
01:09:00,726 --> 01:09:04,438
I was doing laps when you called.

763
01:09:05,814 --> 01:09:09,527
Lucky for us, I only did eight.

764
01:09:12,196 --> 01:09:14,031
This is it.

765
01:09:15,032 --> 01:09:17,534
This is the Renoir.

766
01:09:27,086 --> 01:09:29,546
I like it.

767
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:32,883
I like the painting.

768
01:09:35,594 --> 01:09:38,180
I like everything in here.

769
01:09:40,349 --> 01:09:41,558
Relax, baby...

770
01:09:41,642 --> 01:09:45,896
Now, just who do you
think you're talking to like this?

771
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,732
Don't you realise
I'm a grandmother?

772
01:10:09,253 --> 01:10:12,798
It's not flattering
to look too surprised.

773
01:10:13,882 --> 01:10:16,260
I'll just be a minute.

774
01:10:31,859 --> 01:10:33,652
I like the lights on.

775
01:10:33,736 --> 01:10:36,780
Then go home and turn them on.

776
01:10:36,864 --> 01:10:40,284
Oh. I'm sorry.

777
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,907
Come on.

778
01:11:21,492 --> 01:11:24,411
Dad. Come on, wake up, Dad.

779
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,456
- What? What?
- Melanie's sick.

780
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:29,583
- What?
- Melanie's sick.

781
01:11:30,876 --> 01:11:33,921
- The baby's sick.
- The baby's sick?

782
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:37,758
Are you coming, Flap?

783
01:11:37,841 --> 01:11:41,553
- What do you think's wrong?
- I have to look first.

784
01:11:44,139 --> 01:11:45,557
Come on, Dad.

785
01:11:55,234 --> 01:11:56,818
Thank you.

786
01:11:56,902 --> 01:12:00,239
You can go to bed.
She's gonna be all right, she is.

787
01:12:00,322 --> 01:12:03,700
- I can't sleep.
- Go to bed, I'll be there soon.

788
01:12:03,784 --> 01:12:05,661
We're making this a drama.

789
01:12:05,744 --> 01:12:08,539
It's not going to qualify
as high drama.

790
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:10,874
It's OK, it's OK.

791
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:14,336
Thanks.

792
01:12:17,089 --> 01:12:19,132
I'm sure it's the croup.

793
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:22,678
Remember, Tommy had it twice?

794
01:12:25,597 --> 01:12:27,641
Guess you were in the library.

795
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:35,148
God, that's the worst
sound in the world.

796
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,527
How long do you keep her in here?

797
01:12:41,196 --> 01:12:45,993
- Why? Are you going back to bed?
- I just asked how long.

798
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:49,621
Well, I don't know.

799
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:54,835
Until her throat clears or I lose
20 pounds, whichever comes first.

800
01:12:54,918 --> 01:12:58,630
I don't know, I don't know.
About 20 minutes, I guess.

801
01:13:01,216 --> 01:13:03,051
I've been offered a job.

802
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:08,890
What?
Why didn't you say something?

803
01:13:10,475 --> 01:13:12,519
I wanted to think about it.

804
01:13:13,645 --> 01:13:17,858
It's head of the English department
at Kearney State College.

805
01:13:17,941 --> 01:13:19,776
About the same money.

806
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,988
Oh. Where is it?

807
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:24,531
Nebraska.

808
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,872
I really don't want to move.

809
01:13:31,955 --> 01:13:35,042
I love the school,
the paediatricians...

810
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:37,502
It's the head of the department.

811
01:13:38,837 --> 01:13:42,549
We'll talk about it, all right?
I like it here, Flap.

812
01:13:44,384 --> 01:13:47,804
Head of the department, that's...
That's great.

813
01:13:53,393 --> 01:13:55,103
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye.

814
01:13:55,187 --> 01:13:56,897
Come on, Teddy.

815
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:00,067
Don't kiss the baby,
she may still be sick.

816
01:14:00,609 --> 01:14:02,819
Have a good day at school.

817
01:14:09,993 --> 01:14:12,537
Oh, you don't know the night I had!

818
01:14:12,621 --> 01:14:18,794
Melanie decided to get the croup at
3am and I haven't gotten any sleep.

819
01:14:18,877 --> 01:14:24,049
He may be kidding, but Flap says
we're going to some Nebraska college.

820
01:14:24,132 --> 01:14:30,055
I'm not sure, but I think
Sam is becoming someone that I need.

821
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:33,517
I'm lying here next to the astronaut.

822
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,644
Are you really?

823
01:14:37,229 --> 01:14:39,022
How was it?

824
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:43,902
- I'll speak to you later.
- Oh, I feel so good for you.

825
01:14:43,985 --> 01:14:46,363
I do. You call me
as soon as you can.

826
01:14:46,446 --> 01:14:48,657
- Bye.
- Bye.

827
01:14:49,783 --> 01:14:50,784
Mel...

828
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:53,245
OK, Mel.

829
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:01,962
I just want to make this clear,
you know.

830
01:15:02,045 --> 01:15:04,923
I see other women.

831
01:15:06,049 --> 01:15:08,134
I didn't think we were engaged.

832
01:15:08,218 --> 01:15:10,387
- OK, OK.
- Your ego, really!

833
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:13,807
OK. Let's stay in tonight.

834
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:17,394
- You're saving a fortune on me.
- I'll cook.

835
01:15:17,477 --> 01:15:21,565
It's been three weeks,
and you haven't even seen my house.

836
01:15:21,648 --> 01:15:24,234
My best instincts
had me avoiding it.

837
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,908
What are you thinking?

838
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:44,254
I'll tell you what.

839
01:15:46,923 --> 01:15:48,967
I think this is really sad,

840
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:53,346
that you feel that you need
all this stuff to impress girls with.

841
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:55,265
Need it?

842
01:15:55,932 --> 01:15:58,476
Sometimes it isn't enough.

843
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,980
There's nothing wrong
with using your assets.

844
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:06,026
I think it turns your profession
into a sex trap.

845
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:10,488
Oh, come on. Everybody uses
whatever they have. I earned it!

846
01:16:10,572 --> 01:16:15,285
There's 106 astronauts in the
whole world and I'm one of them!

847
01:16:15,368 --> 01:16:17,620
It's a big part of me.

848
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:19,539
I'm sorry. I didn't...

849
01:16:19,622 --> 01:16:23,752
I didn't mean to trip
on such a deeply felt principle.

850
01:16:37,724 --> 01:16:40,685
Do you want to know what bothers me?

851
01:16:43,563 --> 01:16:49,402
None of us ever got together
in one room, locked all the doors,

852
01:16:49,486 --> 01:16:52,989
and compared notes
on the experience.

853
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:57,118
I think we had to pretend
it wasn't the fun that it was.

854
01:17:00,872 --> 01:17:02,665
You do sense the speed.

855
01:17:02,749 --> 01:17:06,628
I remember looking out
the window of the spacecraft...

856
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:14,219
I sound like somebody with a big
belly telling their Korea stories.

857
01:17:14,302 --> 01:17:16,971
Anyway, once I'm
looking out the window.

858
01:17:17,055 --> 01:17:22,477
I see a piece of the spacecraft,
and it's whistling along the ground.

859
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,646
It doesn't make a sound.

860
01:17:25,563 --> 01:17:31,736
The only sound you hear,
the only noise in the entire world,

861
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,863
is your heart beating.

862
01:17:41,871 --> 01:17:43,665
It's indescribable.

863
01:17:43,748 --> 01:17:48,002
Maybe they can think of a better way
of saying it, but that was it.

864
01:17:48,086 --> 01:17:51,881
That was my moment,
the one that doesn't go away.

865
01:17:53,174 --> 01:17:55,218
You know what I mean?

866
01:17:56,052 --> 01:17:57,679
Yes.

867
01:18:01,266 --> 01:18:02,851
Hey...

868
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:05,395
This is my moment.

869
01:18:12,151 --> 01:18:14,612
No, don't get nervous, Garrett.

870
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,918
Flap?

871
01:18:32,463 --> 01:18:34,090
Anybody?

872
01:18:53,818 --> 01:18:57,488
You don't think it's love
because we're having fun.

873
01:18:57,572 --> 01:19:01,701
Love can be fun.
Would you stop making faces?

874
01:19:04,621 --> 01:19:07,081
That's wonderful.

875
01:19:07,165 --> 01:19:11,044
What we have here is
a typical grad-school girl crush.

876
01:19:11,127 --> 01:19:15,673
Would you please, please, please
stop telling me this is a crush?

877
01:19:15,757 --> 01:19:19,344
The fun with getting involved
with someone unavailable

878
01:19:19,427 --> 01:19:24,098
and slightly older is sometimes you
get to hear what's really going on.

879
01:19:24,182 --> 01:19:28,269
- Flap, you are such a...
- Incredible asshole!

880
01:19:31,481 --> 01:19:33,191
Excuse me.

881
01:19:39,072 --> 01:19:41,532
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, buddy!

882
01:19:42,492 --> 01:19:43,951
Emma!

883
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:48,873
God damn it, Emma, you'll ruin us!

884
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:52,585
- Cos you're a spectacle!
- I am not!

885
01:19:54,796 --> 01:19:57,632
Stop jiggling her, she'll throw up.

886
01:19:57,715 --> 01:20:00,093
Your timing was perfect.

887
01:20:00,176 --> 01:20:03,471
You caught us before we did anything.

888
01:20:03,554 --> 01:20:06,599
I'm taking the kids to Houston.

889
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,684
Give me the baby.

890
01:20:08,768 --> 01:20:11,813
You don't know what I did,

891
01:20:11,896 --> 01:20:18,069
just like I don't know what you do
on your afternoon drives.

892
01:20:18,152 --> 01:20:22,240
Professor Horton,
can we talk about my grade?

893
01:20:22,323 --> 01:20:25,993
You ought to be happy I'm going.

894
01:20:26,077 --> 01:20:29,622
If I stayed here,
I'd make life hell for you.

895
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:31,249
Don't follow me.

896
01:20:31,332 --> 01:20:33,584
Excuse me. Excuse me.

897
01:20:35,086 --> 01:20:38,339
Excuse me! Excuse me!

898
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:47,348
It's them. It's them!

899
01:21:00,528 --> 01:21:04,156
- Garrett, come meet Emma.
- No, you don't need outsiders.

900
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,410
- You're no outsider!
- I'll see them later.

901
01:21:07,493 --> 01:21:10,037
Em, Em, this is Garrett.

902
01:21:10,121 --> 01:21:14,208
Oh! Pleasure to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

903
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:17,044
Your mother's been looking
forward to this, too.

904
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:21,924
So, go ahead.

905
01:21:25,386 --> 01:21:28,180
- Anything wrong, Garrett?
- No.

906
01:21:28,264 --> 01:21:30,725
It was very nice to have met you.

907
01:21:30,808 --> 01:21:33,352
Must be nice to be home.

908
01:21:33,436 --> 01:21:35,730
Oh, it's great. It's great.

909
01:21:37,273 --> 01:21:39,275
I'll be over later.

910
01:21:39,358 --> 01:21:42,320
They're tired,
and will get to sleep early,

911
01:21:42,403 --> 01:21:44,906
and I'd like to get to bed early.

912
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:49,160
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!

913
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:50,494
Bye-bye.

914
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:55,916
Come on out. All right.
This one likes to squeeze.

915
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,504
Teddy likes to squeeze, Tommy likes
a squeeze. You both get a squeeze.

916
01:22:02,006 --> 01:22:05,092
The baby. Where's the baby?

917
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:14,769
Oh, there is my baby.
Look at the baby!

918
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:18,230
I think she looks a little like you.

919
01:22:18,314 --> 01:22:23,694
A little? Gee, it's like
looking in the mirror.

920
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:28,491
She loved the ride.
She hardly cried at all.

921
01:22:30,993 --> 01:22:33,120
- Bring in the suitcases.
- OK.

922
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:37,166
- Mom...
- Well, I talk to you every day.

923
01:22:39,669 --> 01:22:43,005
- Mother, you look great.
- You look terrible.

924
01:22:43,089 --> 01:22:47,093
Nobody wants a girl
who's washed-out and tired-looking.

925
01:22:48,052 --> 01:22:50,262
I just drove about 1,000 miles.

926
01:22:50,346 --> 01:22:53,516
Besides, all the men
love me the way I am, Mother.

927
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:57,603
It's like you, when you finally take
one small step away from Flap,

928
01:22:57,686 --> 01:23:03,526
it's with a married,
unavailable, older lowan, hmm?

929
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:07,738
Tell me about the astronaut.

930
01:23:07,822 --> 01:23:09,448
We have to talk about it.

931
01:23:09,532 --> 01:23:12,827
Are you going to sleep now,
or are we gonna talk?

932
01:23:25,965 --> 01:23:28,426
How's the astronaut, Mother?

933
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:33,556
Really?

934
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:37,059
Oh, really?

935
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:40,146
Yes!

936
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:42,231
He has a name, though.

937
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:44,400
You really like him.

938
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:46,861
Yeah.

939
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:49,989
Well, it's just so...

940
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:55,744
It's so strange that relatively...

941
01:23:55,828 --> 01:24:00,875
Relatively late in life,
I've found that sex is so...

942
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:05,504
so... so...

943
01:24:05,671 --> 01:24:07,631
so...

944
01:24:07,715 --> 01:24:11,719
...so fan-fucking-tastic!

945
01:24:11,802 --> 01:24:14,763
Anyway, that's what he calls it.

946
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:35,784
A moth to flame.

947
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:40,956
This affair is going to kill me.

948
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:44,960
No. Maybe not. Why do you say that?

949
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:49,506
Come on, Mom.

950
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:53,093
I never thought
I'd start to need him.

951
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:59,433
You're so lucky you have a pool.

952
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:09,777
Come on, stand there. Stand there!

953
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:17,159
- OK.
- OK.

954
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:20,371
Let's talk about Los Angeles.
Do you miss it?

955
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,878
It was so interesting
dating Jews after the divorce.

956
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:29,588
They are so lively.

957
01:25:29,672 --> 01:25:31,799
- Really?
- Yeah.

958
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:34,551
In Los Angeles, they were so anxious

959
01:25:34,635 --> 01:25:37,930
to show they understood
your secret thoughts.

960
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:41,725
- Patsy!
- And I was just glad I had some.

961
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,728
Honey, there's
a telephone call for you.

962
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,606
Hello.

963
01:25:48,691 --> 01:25:50,526
Oh, hi, Flap. How are you?

964
01:25:51,694 --> 01:25:53,529
I'm fine.

965
01:25:56,949 --> 01:26:00,369
- I look older, like everyone else.
- She does not.

966
01:26:01,912 --> 01:26:06,083
Flap, you sound the same and I'm not
sure that's such a good thing.

967
01:26:07,126 --> 01:26:09,169
Yeah, she's right here.

968
01:26:10,087 --> 01:26:13,590
No, we have other things
to talk about besides you.

969
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:20,389
Hello?

970
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:23,016
I'm fine.

971
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:28,230
What's up? Feeling contrite?

972
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,652
You don't seem to understand.
I saw you together.

973
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:37,156
What?

974
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:42,244
You know, Flap, I can't believe
you're doing this to us.

975
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:46,540
Well, I think you're spiteful,

976
01:26:46,623 --> 01:26:50,002
and I don't know
when the hell that happened.

977
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:54,590
No! Goodbye. I'll... Goodbye.

978
01:27:04,474 --> 01:27:09,563
Flap accepted the job at Kearney,
Nebraska. We're moving in a week.

979
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:11,690
I don't know why you don't leave him.

980
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:15,402
Honestly, I don't know, either.
He's cute.

981
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:39,301
I've been packing for us all week.

982
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,729
Sure remembers her daddy.

983
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:55,192
So, are you gonna stay mad?

984
01:27:55,275 --> 01:28:00,030
I think being uprooted without my
consent is worth a pout, don't you?

985
01:28:05,077 --> 01:28:07,579
Come on.

986
01:28:07,663 --> 01:28:10,040
- Head of the department.
- I know.

987
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:11,750
Here.

988
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:22,177
- Aurora?
- Garrett! I'm back here.

989
01:28:23,637 --> 01:28:26,139
Well, hello, stranger.

990
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:28,475
What's it been, about two days?

991
01:28:30,519 --> 01:28:32,938
Your family still around?

992
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:35,649
No, they left.

993
01:28:39,486 --> 01:28:41,321
What?

994
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:59,047
You probably know
what I'm going to say.

995
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:03,927
Oh, maybe not. I hope not.

996
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:10,100
Well...

997
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:16,690
You're some kind of woman,
but I'm the wrong kind of man,

998
01:29:16,773 --> 01:29:21,570
and it doesn't look like my shot
at being the right kind is...

999
01:29:21,653 --> 01:29:24,698
as good as I was hoping for.

1000
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:31,455
You don't even know how much
you'll miss me.

1001
01:29:32,622 --> 01:29:35,167
I don't want to blow smoke
up your ass.

1002
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:39,296
Oh! What a relief.

1003
01:29:41,173 --> 01:29:45,177
It's just that I'm starting
to feel an obligation here.

1004
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:49,598
It makes it rough,
especially living next door.

1005
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:53,351
I'm starting to think
I gotta watch what I'm doing...

1006
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:12,329
I... I am gonna miss you...

1007
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:15,665
and I do feel bad.

1008
01:30:20,754 --> 01:30:23,215
You're lucky.

1009
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:26,468
I feel humiliated.

1010
01:30:52,244 --> 01:30:54,329
Can I have a picture of you?

1011
01:30:54,412 --> 01:30:57,332
Yeah, but the only one I have
has Flap in it.

1012
01:30:57,415 --> 01:30:59,292
I don't mind.

1013
01:31:20,146 --> 01:31:22,190
Come here, give me a kiss.

1014
01:31:54,973 --> 01:31:58,018
When you finish,
I need this kind of type.

1015
01:31:58,101 --> 01:32:01,146
Hello, Emma. Hi, baby.

1016
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:04,691
She wanted her daddy
to see her dressed up.

1017
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:06,860
He'll be here any minute.

1018
01:32:06,943 --> 01:32:09,112
- I'll talk to you later.
- OK.

1019
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:14,117
Excuse me.

1020
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:26,004
Miss?

1021
01:32:26,087 --> 01:32:27,839
Miss?

1022
01:32:37,056 --> 01:32:40,518
Don't make me run after you,
I have a toddler here!

1023
01:33:04,876 --> 01:33:08,129
Are you the reason
that we came to Nebraska?

1024
01:33:09,214 --> 01:33:11,591
I think that Flap should talk to you.

1025
01:33:12,842 --> 01:33:14,969
We discussed that.

1026
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:18,806
I don't want to say anything
until he does, except that

1027
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:24,145
I don't think there's an emotion
you're having I couldn't... validate.

1028
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:33,238
Tell you what.

1029
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:36,824
If you see Flap,
tell him his wife and his baby

1030
01:33:36,908 --> 01:33:39,244
went to get their flu shots,
all right?

1031
01:33:39,327 --> 01:33:41,371
Why don't you do that?

1032
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:48,419
Just hold still.

1033
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:51,214
That's a good girl.

1034
01:33:51,297 --> 01:33:54,842
OK? You're all finished.
It's all over.

1035
01:33:55,843 --> 01:33:59,973
If it makes you feel any better,
Mommy's getting a shot, too.

1036
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:03,559
- Can I give her a pop?
- Sure.

1037
01:34:03,643 --> 01:34:06,020
- Here.
- There you go.

1038
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:11,567
Are they gonna tell me
if my husband calls?

1039
01:34:13,152 --> 01:34:15,321
You have a lump in your armpit.

1040
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:18,324
- How long has it been there?
- I don't know.

1041
01:34:18,408 --> 01:34:20,702
Melanie, stop kicking the cabinet!

1042
01:34:20,785 --> 01:34:24,247
There's two of them.
It's not very big, though.

1043
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:28,084
I have to be out of town next week
but you shouldn't wait.

1044
01:34:28,167 --> 01:34:29,752
They should come out.

1045
01:34:29,836 --> 01:34:32,922
Come out? Should I be scared?

1046
01:34:33,006 --> 01:34:38,803
If you're scared, you'll be happier
when it turns out to be nothing.

1047
01:34:38,886 --> 01:34:43,391
Dr Butch, Mom should get a pop, too,
for her shot.

1048
01:34:44,475 --> 01:34:47,770
- Right. Here, Mom.
- Thanks, Mel.

1049
01:34:48,396 --> 01:34:50,273
Well, I know what it is.

1050
01:34:50,356 --> 01:34:53,985
You don't keep yourself up
so your sweat glands are clogged.

1051
01:34:54,068 --> 01:34:56,237
- It's a cyst.
- So I shouldn't worry?

1052
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,240
It's a cyst,
right where your oil glands are.

1053
01:34:59,323 --> 01:35:04,037
You never knew how to eat right
and you've never learned how to wash.

1054
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,748
You're right. Thanks.
Talk to Melanie.

1055
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:08,416
- Say hi.
- Hi.

1056
01:35:08,499 --> 01:35:11,335
Hello, how are you?
I sent you a blouse.

1057
01:35:11,419 --> 01:35:13,212
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

1058
01:35:13,296 --> 01:35:18,217
OK. Say good...
Say goodbye to your mother.

1059
01:35:25,808 --> 01:35:27,643
What's her name?

1060
01:35:27,727 --> 01:35:31,230
Janice. What did the doctor say?

1061
01:35:31,314 --> 01:35:36,444
I told you, Flap. It's scary
that he wants to do it so fast.

1062
01:35:36,527 --> 01:35:39,113
Janice... with her little folder.

1063
01:35:39,197 --> 01:35:43,618
"I can't say anything until he does.
We've discussed it, Flap and I."

1064
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:47,705
I mean, really, Flap!
"Validate my feelings." Your taste!

1065
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:51,000
What the doctor said,
feeling good when it turns out...

1066
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:54,670
No! Forget it, I won't make you
feel better, I'm too mad.

1067
01:35:54,754 --> 01:35:56,589
Dinner!

1068
01:36:12,396 --> 01:36:16,234
Dear, you have a malignancy.

1069
01:36:22,073 --> 01:36:24,742
- Say it again?
- Malignancy.

1070
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:32,833
Rosie... our girl is in trouble.

1071
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:35,545
She has a cyst that's malignant.

1072
01:36:35,628 --> 01:36:40,174
They're taking her to a hospital
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

1073
01:36:46,847 --> 01:36:49,350
We'll release her in a few days.

1074
01:36:49,433 --> 01:36:52,853
We do more and more
on an outpatient basis.

1075
01:36:52,937 --> 01:36:56,524
We shouldn't need to take her back,
unless the illness escalates.

1076
01:36:56,607 --> 01:36:58,693
But you're not telling me anything.

1077
01:36:58,776 --> 01:37:01,320
What are you confused about?

1078
01:37:01,404 --> 01:37:04,031
How is she?

1079
01:37:04,115 --> 01:37:08,035
I tell people to hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

1080
01:37:09,996 --> 01:37:12,290
And they let you get away with that?

1081
01:37:13,457 --> 01:37:17,920
Look, you're wrong to see everything
as so desperate and serious.

1082
01:37:18,004 --> 01:37:22,300
And it won't do your daughter any
good to get those signals, either.

1083
01:37:28,055 --> 01:37:30,433
What's wrong now?

1084
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:35,021
I'm so frustrated with that doctor.
But it boils down to this.

1085
01:37:35,104 --> 01:37:38,983
You're getting out and
you don't have to stay here again.

1086
01:37:39,066 --> 01:37:42,778
Unless the illness spreads.
I really don't feel sick.

1087
01:37:42,862 --> 01:37:47,366
Hey, Emma. Come to New York
for a visit. My treat.

1088
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,163
Great. We'll have to see.
Look at these letters from the kids.

1089
01:37:52,246 --> 01:37:55,916
Teddy says he couldn't sleep,
but Melanie slept fine.

1090
01:37:56,751 --> 01:38:00,963
Tommy thinks there's nothing
to be concerned about...

1091
01:38:01,047 --> 01:38:04,592
Hey, I mean it! You have
time before you see the doctor.

1092
01:38:04,675 --> 01:38:07,595
Come see New York for a few days.

1093
01:38:08,721 --> 01:38:11,724
It's not a bad idea,
a vacation by yourself.

1094
01:38:11,807 --> 01:38:13,726
Rosie and I are here with the kids.

1095
01:38:13,809 --> 01:38:17,563
- Take advantage of your freedom.
- I know you wanna go.

1096
01:38:18,314 --> 01:38:22,860
This isn't like taking those kids
to Disneyland right before the end?

1097
01:38:22,943 --> 01:38:24,361
Stop!

1098
01:38:25,071 --> 01:38:27,281
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Patsy, I'm kidding!

1099
01:38:33,537 --> 01:38:36,415
Do you feel funny
about leaving the kids?

1100
01:38:36,499 --> 01:38:40,002
I'm not leaving them,
I'm entrusting them to their father.

1101
01:38:41,253 --> 01:38:45,216
Oh, I thought as long as your mother
and Rosie are in town...

1102
01:38:45,299 --> 01:38:48,177
Not them. You.

1103
01:38:58,854 --> 01:39:03,108
- Emma, look! Look! Look!
- Are we there yet?

1104
01:39:03,192 --> 01:39:06,821
- Oh, God! I can't believe I'm here!
- Isn't it beautiful?

1105
01:39:06,904 --> 01:39:11,200
I want you to meet some of my
friends. Not friends like you and I.

1106
01:39:13,994 --> 01:39:16,330
- Hi.
- Hi.

1107
01:39:16,413 --> 01:39:18,415
Emma, this is Lizbeth.

1108
01:39:18,499 --> 01:39:21,794
- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi. It's Lizbeth.

1109
01:39:21,877 --> 01:39:26,340
- Isn't that what I said?
- You said "Elizabeth". It's Lizbeth.

1110
01:39:26,423 --> 01:39:30,886
- Oh, two names? Liz Beth?
- No, one. Lizbeth.

1111
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:33,514
- Lizbeth?
- Never mind.

1112
01:39:33,597 --> 01:39:36,809
- And this is Jane.
- Thank heavens!

1113
01:39:39,687 --> 01:39:41,397
Here, that's Melanie.

1114
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:44,483
Oh! Look at that!

1115
01:39:44,567 --> 01:39:47,736
Teddy's the younger one,
Tommy's the older one.

1116
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:54,243
- The little girl's incredible.
- Don't think she doesn't know it.

1117
01:39:54,326 --> 01:39:58,372
Oh, Patsy's got a real thing
going with her. The boys, too.

1118
01:39:58,455 --> 01:40:01,667
Are you waiting till she's in school
before working again?

1119
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:04,128
Oh, I never really work.

1120
01:40:05,296 --> 01:40:07,590
Well. That's OK.

1121
01:40:07,673 --> 01:40:09,508
Thanks.

1122
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,221
Great.

1123
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:20,644
When did she find out?

1124
01:40:20,728 --> 01:40:23,981
- About a month ago.
- There.

1125
01:40:27,901 --> 01:40:30,112
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1126
01:40:30,195 --> 01:40:33,866
It was a great honour meeting you,
have a wonderful time.

1127
01:40:33,949 --> 01:40:35,117
Thank you.

1128
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,496
Those beautiful children are lucky
to have you for a mommy.

1129
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:42,041
Y'all go ahead, take the first cab.

1130
01:40:42,124 --> 01:40:44,585
- Sure?
- Yeah. That's fine.

1131
01:40:44,668 --> 01:40:46,628
- Bye-bye, Patsy.
- See you.

1132
01:40:46,712 --> 01:40:49,256
Bye, darling.

1133
01:40:52,134 --> 01:40:55,971
- You told them, didn't you?
- Yeah, you don't mind, do you?

1134
01:40:56,055 --> 01:40:58,349
Of course not.

1135
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:03,520
Emma, come on. They're jerks.
They don't know anything.

1136
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:06,899
- Why do they act like that?
- Emma, talk to me!

1137
01:41:06,982 --> 01:41:11,195
It's not you. I don't care.
I don't mind them knowing.

1138
01:41:13,489 --> 01:41:18,994
In less than two hours, two of them
told me that they'd had abortions.

1139
01:41:19,078 --> 01:41:21,622
Three of them told me
they were divorced.

1140
01:41:21,705 --> 01:41:24,792
One hasn't talked to her mother
in four years.

1141
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:28,420
And the one that has little Natalie
in a boarding school

1142
01:41:28,504 --> 01:41:31,048
because she has to travel
for her job?

1143
01:41:31,131 --> 01:41:32,966
Hell, Patsy!

1144
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:38,889
Oh, the one with the yeast disease
that thought she had vaginal herpes?

1145
01:41:38,972 --> 01:41:42,017
If that's fit conversation for lunch,

1146
01:41:42,101 --> 01:41:46,271
what's so god-awful terrible
about my little tumours?

1147
01:41:47,106 --> 01:41:51,652
Yeah, of course, but...
what do you want me to do?

1148
01:41:51,735 --> 01:41:55,239
I want you to tell them
it ain't so tragic!

1149
01:41:56,907 --> 01:41:59,284
People do get better.

1150
01:42:00,536 --> 01:42:03,413
Tell them it's OK
to talk about the cancer!

1151
01:42:10,212 --> 01:42:12,381
Patsy tells us you have cancer.

1152
01:42:15,509 --> 01:42:17,344
We should talk later.

1153
01:42:17,427 --> 01:42:21,557
I'm a nutritionist,
and my husband's with Ticketron.

1154
01:42:22,766 --> 01:42:24,852
Thanks, Patsy.

1155
01:42:24,935 --> 01:42:29,231
- Hello.
- Flap? Have you heard anything?

1156
01:42:29,314 --> 01:42:32,943
No. Emma hasn't
called you either, then, huh?

1157
01:42:33,026 --> 01:42:35,320
No. How are the children?

1158
01:42:35,404 --> 01:42:38,532
I wish I were so carefree.

1159
01:42:38,615 --> 01:42:42,578
Yes, well, they don't have
anything to feel ashamed about.

1160
01:42:42,661 --> 01:42:46,498
You know something? You always
lose your manners around me.

1161
01:42:46,582 --> 01:42:48,876
Stop it, Flap.
Let me know if you hear.

1162
01:42:48,959 --> 01:42:51,628
If you talk to Emma,
don't sound so frightened.

1163
01:42:51,712 --> 01:42:54,298
I don't sound... frightened!

1164
01:42:57,092 --> 01:42:59,511
Daddy.

1165
01:43:07,769 --> 01:43:12,441
Hi, Mother. They're having this party
for me so I can't talk very long.

1166
01:43:12,524 --> 01:43:15,736
But I think I'm coming home
a few days early.

1167
01:43:17,738 --> 01:43:18,864
Not really.

1168
01:43:22,576 --> 01:43:25,287
It's about time
they gave us this room.

1169
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:28,624
Mother, I can't believe you did this.
It's great.

1170
01:43:28,707 --> 01:43:33,587
Careful! These are worth more
than you'll make in your lifetime.

1171
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:37,466
I grew up with it, you can take it
for a couple of minutes.

1172
01:43:37,549 --> 01:43:40,636
This is fine. Thank you so much.

1173
01:43:41,970 --> 01:43:44,640
Thank you.

1174
01:43:47,351 --> 01:43:49,770
Oh, they're wonderful!

1175
01:43:49,853 --> 01:43:52,147
They look good next to each other.

1176
01:44:00,947 --> 01:44:04,826
Help me with this, Melanie.
Gorgeous isn't everything.

1177
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:07,788
This one, this one... two more.

1178
01:44:13,585 --> 01:44:17,005
The response to the drugs we tried...

1179
01:44:18,131 --> 01:44:20,133
isn't what we hoped.

1180
01:44:20,217 --> 01:44:25,722
There are investigatory drugs
which we are willing to utilise.

1181
01:44:25,806 --> 01:44:28,767
However, if you become incapacitated,

1182
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:33,438
or it becomes unreasonable for you
to handle your affairs for a time,

1183
01:44:33,522 --> 01:44:38,860
it might be wise
to make some decisions now.

1184
01:44:43,615 --> 01:44:46,284
Any questions?

1185
01:44:46,368 --> 01:44:48,411
No.

1186
01:44:51,832 --> 01:44:54,251
I know what you're saying.

1187
01:44:54,334 --> 01:44:57,838
I have to figure out
what to do with my kids.

1188
01:45:19,568 --> 01:45:23,363
Excuse me. It's after ten.
Give my daughter the pain shot.

1189
01:45:23,446 --> 01:45:25,365
Mrs Greenway, I was going to.

1190
01:45:25,448 --> 01:45:27,784
- Good. Go ahead.
- Just a few minutes.

1191
01:45:27,868 --> 01:45:29,870
Please. It's after ten.

1192
01:45:29,953 --> 01:45:32,747
I don't see why
she has to have this pain?

1193
01:45:32,831 --> 01:45:36,710
- Ma'am, It's not my patient.
- It's time! Do something!

1194
01:45:36,793 --> 01:45:39,504
All she has to do is
hold on until ten!

1195
01:45:39,588 --> 01:45:43,800
And it's past ten!
My daughter's in pain!

1196
01:45:43,884 --> 01:45:46,386
- Give her the shot!
- Are you going to behave?

1197
01:45:46,469 --> 01:45:48,930
GIVE MY DAUGHTER THE SHOT!

1198
01:45:53,101 --> 01:45:55,520
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1199
01:46:01,985 --> 01:46:04,237
Can I have 222, please?

1200
01:46:28,637 --> 01:46:31,598
- Let's get her!
- I'm pushing Grandma in!

1201
01:46:31,681 --> 01:46:33,933
Don't you dare! I mean it.

1202
01:46:35,644 --> 01:46:36,853
Come on.

1203
01:46:39,272 --> 01:46:42,567
- Say, "Hi, Granny."
- Hi, Granny.

1204
01:46:42,651 --> 01:46:44,694
Aurora?

1205
01:47:16,851 --> 01:47:18,686
Well...

1206
01:47:19,979 --> 01:47:24,109
Who would have expected you
to be a nice guy?

1207
01:47:37,789 --> 01:47:39,416
Who?

1208
01:47:40,667 --> 01:47:42,710
It's good to see you.

1209
01:47:57,684 --> 01:48:01,271
Take care of yourself. I'll call you.

1210
01:48:06,025 --> 01:48:08,528
I'm real glad I came.

1211
01:48:08,611 --> 01:48:11,489
Your coming meant a lot to Emma.

1212
01:48:11,573 --> 01:48:14,325
It meant a lot to me, Garrett.

1213
01:48:14,409 --> 01:48:17,537
I'll be at the hospital all the time,
I'll call you.

1214
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:21,833
No, if there's someone there, I'll
hear that funny sound in your voice.

1215
01:48:21,916 --> 01:48:24,544
I don't care.
Who cares? I don't care.

1216
01:48:24,627 --> 01:48:26,880
I'm glad you came, I love you.

1217
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:46,191
Garrett!

1218
01:48:47,483 --> 01:48:49,485
Garrett!

1219
01:48:49,569 --> 01:48:51,613
Come here.

1220
01:48:55,658 --> 01:48:57,493
I was curious.

1221
01:48:57,577 --> 01:49:00,705
Do you have any reaction
to my telling you I love you?

1222
01:49:02,457 --> 01:49:06,377
I was just inches
from a clean getaway.

1223
01:49:06,461 --> 01:49:08,713
Well, you're stuck, so face it.

1224
01:49:11,966 --> 01:49:16,012
Well, I don't know what else to say
except my stock answer.

1225
01:49:16,095 --> 01:49:17,680
Which is?

1226
01:49:18,848 --> 01:49:21,351
I love you, too, kid.

1227
01:49:42,205 --> 01:49:43,831
Goodbye.

1228
01:49:53,216 --> 01:49:56,177
At the airport,
we were standing there

1229
01:49:56,260 --> 01:50:00,890
in front of the door hugging
and kissing, and saying goodbye.

1230
01:50:00,973 --> 01:50:04,018
- And you know what?
- What?

1231
01:50:04,102 --> 01:50:07,897
I got up the nerve
to tell him I loved him.

1232
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:10,024
You know what his reaction was?

1233
01:50:10,108 --> 01:50:13,152
I don't give a shit, Mom, I'm sick.

1234
01:50:17,198 --> 01:50:21,202
Not everything is about you,
I've got a lot to figure out.

1235
01:50:23,413 --> 01:50:28,167
- I just don't wanna fight any more.
- What do you mean? When do we fight?

1236
01:50:30,128 --> 01:50:32,171
When do we fight? You amaze me.

1237
01:50:32,255 --> 01:50:35,758
I always think of us as fighting.

1238
01:50:35,842 --> 01:50:37,885
That's from your end.

1239
01:50:37,969 --> 01:50:41,264
That's cos you're
never satisfied with me.

1240
01:51:43,534 --> 01:51:47,246
- Have you seen her yet today?
- Yes.

1241
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:51,250
I've been with her most of
last night and today, as usual.

1242
01:51:52,543 --> 01:51:57,173
I haven't, uh...
really talked to the kids yet.

1243
01:51:58,341 --> 01:52:00,635
I'm not sure how much they realise,

1244
01:52:00,718 --> 01:52:03,346
but they know
something bad's happening.

1245
01:52:03,429 --> 01:52:05,640
Flap...

1246
01:52:05,723 --> 01:52:07,767
Patsy wants to raise Melanie

1247
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:10,061
and maybe the boys.

1248
01:52:10,144 --> 01:52:12,355
I think they should be with me,
don't you?

1249
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:15,691
What can you be thinking about?

1250
01:52:15,775 --> 01:52:20,863
Raising three children,
working full time and chasing women

1251
01:52:20,947 --> 01:52:23,157
requires a lot more energy
than you have.

1252
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:25,826
You know, one of the
nicest qualities about you

1253
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:28,955
is that you recognise
your weaknesses.

1254
01:52:29,038 --> 01:52:32,249
Don't lose that quality
when you need it the most.

1255
01:52:38,005 --> 01:52:42,760
You have no right,
nor any invitation,

1256
01:52:42,843 --> 01:52:47,807
to discuss where
or how my children live.

1257
01:53:06,409 --> 01:53:10,955
From what the doctor says,
it's time that we have the talk now.

1258
01:53:12,123 --> 01:53:15,668
Do you know how much I hate
the idea of losing you?

1259
01:53:18,170 --> 01:53:20,172
Yes.

1260
01:53:20,256 --> 01:53:25,511
Well, nobody...
Nobody seems to know that except you.

1261
01:53:26,721 --> 01:53:28,347
I... Well...

1262
01:53:28,431 --> 01:53:30,099
What?

1263
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:35,604
I'm thinking about my identity,
and not having one any more.

1264
01:53:35,688 --> 01:53:38,607
Who am I, if I'm not the man
who's failing Emma?

1265
01:53:38,691 --> 01:53:42,027
- You didn't fail me, Flap.
- I don't wanna discuss it.

1266
01:53:42,111 --> 01:53:46,115
I feel like I'm sucking after
forgiveness, which I probably am.

1267
01:53:47,491 --> 01:53:50,244
You were no more terrible than I was.

1268
01:53:50,327 --> 01:53:52,621
Except for the cheating.

1269
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:57,877
You're right. Let's not do this.

1270
01:53:58,961 --> 01:54:00,838
Look, we had problems.

1271
01:54:00,921 --> 01:54:04,216
It was never over
whether we loved each other.

1272
01:54:08,053 --> 01:54:11,182
Oh, God! That tie!

1273
01:54:11,265 --> 01:54:14,143
I can't believe you wore that!

1274
01:54:14,226 --> 01:54:16,687
The mess it must've been finding it.

1275
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:21,775
The house still isn't in one piece.
It was in the last box I looked in.

1276
01:54:21,859 --> 01:54:23,903
I'll bet.

1277
01:54:24,987 --> 01:54:27,198
God, you're easy to please.

1278
01:54:27,281 --> 01:54:30,493
I don't know why
I couldn't do more of it.

1279
01:54:32,786 --> 01:54:35,372
I'm so glad we're talking, I just am.

1280
01:54:35,456 --> 01:54:40,044
It just means so much to me that
we can still feel like this, so much.

1281
01:54:40,127 --> 01:54:42,505
I swear...

1282
01:54:46,509 --> 01:54:48,969
Listen, I am getting tired.

1283
01:54:50,429 --> 01:54:53,849
Just tell me, hon,
you really want to raise 'em?

1284
01:55:06,946 --> 01:55:11,492
I never thought I was the sort of man
who'd give up his kids.

1285
01:55:11,575 --> 01:55:13,661
It's a lot of work.

1286
01:55:14,787 --> 01:55:19,124
As hard as you think it is,
you end up wishing it were that easy.

1287
01:55:21,293 --> 01:55:23,128
Where do you want them?

1288
01:55:23,212 --> 01:55:25,965
I don't want them
to end up with Janice.

1289
01:55:28,676 --> 01:55:30,761
Well, she's not so bad.

1290
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:40,187
I really don't think
they should be with you, honey.

1291
01:55:46,026 --> 01:55:48,278
Well...

1292
01:55:49,405 --> 01:55:51,824
To tell you the honest truth...

1293
01:55:53,951 --> 01:55:55,995
I'd probably screw it up.

1294
01:56:00,082 --> 01:56:02,334
I'll really miss them.

1295
01:56:07,381 --> 01:56:10,259
Well, maybe we should let
Patsy take them.

1296
01:56:10,342 --> 01:56:15,264
It'd be easy for me to work
research summers in New York.

1297
01:56:15,347 --> 01:56:20,602
No. Patsy really only wants Melanie.
Mother should have them.

1298
01:56:22,104 --> 01:56:24,356
You can see them any time you want.

1299
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:27,067
You'll decide things
for them and everything.

1300
01:56:27,151 --> 01:56:29,278
She can make that very difficult.

1301
01:56:29,361 --> 01:56:31,530
She won't.

1302
01:56:35,701 --> 01:56:39,955
Well, I guess they should be
with your mother.

1303
01:56:41,206 --> 01:56:43,417
I probably have that coming.

1304
01:57:01,643 --> 01:57:05,564
Flap, will you bring
the boys by tomorrow?

1305
01:57:05,647 --> 01:57:09,026
I've got that one waiting for me.
I gotta do it.

1306
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:12,529
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

1307
01:57:23,499 --> 01:57:26,251
Come on, Pats, I gotta get ready.

1308
01:57:26,335 --> 01:57:29,296
Patsy. Make-up!

1309
01:57:33,425 --> 01:57:36,553
Is it terrible to say
I can't stand seeing your mother

1310
01:57:36,637 --> 01:57:38,680
get her hands on that little girl?

1311
01:57:38,764 --> 01:57:41,767
I'd just love to raise
that little girl.

1312
01:57:47,189 --> 01:57:49,233
Look, I'd let you,

1313
01:57:49,316 --> 01:57:51,944
but Teddy couldn't spare her.

1314
01:57:52,861 --> 01:57:55,322
I can't stall any more, all right?

1315
01:57:55,405 --> 01:57:58,492
You go out there
and send the boys in.

1316
01:57:58,575 --> 01:58:00,911
Well, do I get to say something ever?

1317
01:58:00,994 --> 01:58:02,120
No.

1318
01:58:05,582 --> 01:58:09,044
We don't have to do that, right?
Come here.

1319
01:58:13,674 --> 01:58:16,176
You'll be fine. You will.

1320
01:58:21,932 --> 01:58:23,767
It's just this...

1321
01:58:27,562 --> 01:58:29,898
You're my touchstone, Emma.

1322
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,027
The boys.

1323
01:59:16,862 --> 01:59:19,614
Hi. Come on.

1324
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:24,995
I love you. I miss you.
God, I want you to come home.

1325
01:59:26,204 --> 01:59:28,123
Close the door.

1326
01:59:28,331 --> 01:59:31,126
God, you both look so gigantic to me.

1327
01:59:32,502 --> 01:59:35,130
I guess I look pretty bad to you.

1328
01:59:35,213 --> 01:59:37,257
Not so bad.

1329
01:59:41,178 --> 01:59:45,140
You both have beautiful eyes
and your hair's too long.

1330
01:59:45,223 --> 01:59:48,685
I don't care about the back
but keep your bangs cut, OK?

1331
01:59:48,769 --> 01:59:52,022
- It's too long.
- That's a matter of opinion.

1332
01:59:52,105 --> 01:59:54,775
Just keep it short, all right?

1333
01:59:54,858 --> 01:59:56,693
Are you getting well?

1334
02:00:01,031 --> 02:00:02,574
Look up.

1335
02:00:02,657 --> 02:00:05,660
I'm sorry about this
but I can't help it.

1336
02:00:05,744 --> 02:00:08,747
I can't talk too long
or I'll get real upset.

1337
02:00:11,374 --> 02:00:14,419
I want you to make a lot of friends.

1338
02:00:14,503 --> 02:00:20,509
And be real nice to the girls cos
they'll be important to you, I swear.

1339
02:00:20,592 --> 02:00:24,221
We're not afraid of girls,
what makes you think that?

1340
02:00:24,304 --> 02:00:27,057
- Well, you may be later on.
- I doubt it.

1341
02:00:27,140 --> 02:00:30,227
- Why don't you shut up? Shut up!
- You shut up.

1342
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:33,188
Teddy, give me a kiss, come on.

1343
02:00:37,067 --> 02:00:39,986
Tommy, you be sweet. Be sweet.

1344
02:00:41,905 --> 02:00:45,825
And stop trying to pretend
like you hate me. It's silly.

1345
02:00:47,285 --> 02:00:48,912
I like you.

1346
02:00:48,995 --> 02:00:52,374
- Then listen especially close.
- What?

1347
02:00:52,457 --> 02:00:54,709
- Listen real hard?
- I said what.

1348
02:00:57,337 --> 02:01:00,048
I know you like me. I know it.

1349
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:06,137
For the last year or two,
you've pretended like you hate me.

1350
02:01:07,806 --> 02:01:12,018
But I love you very much,
as much as I love anybody,

1351
02:01:12,102 --> 02:01:14,396
as much as I love myself.

1352
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:19,401
And in a few years when I haven't
been around to irritate you,

1353
02:01:19,484 --> 02:01:21,778
you're gonna remember.

1354
02:01:21,861 --> 02:01:27,158
You'll remember when I bought the
baseball glove when we were broke

1355
02:01:27,242 --> 02:01:29,369
or when I read you those stories,

1356
02:01:29,452 --> 02:01:33,957
or when I let you goof off instead
of mowing the lawn, lots of things.

1357
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:37,919
You're gonna realise
that you love me,

1358
02:01:38,003 --> 02:01:42,674
and maybe you'll feel badly because
you never told me, but don't.

1359
02:01:45,051 --> 02:01:47,095
I know that you love me.

1360
02:01:49,973 --> 02:01:53,727
- So don't do that to yourself, OK?
- OK!

1361
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:58,064
- OK?
- I said OK.

1362
02:02:01,568 --> 02:02:03,528
OK, you two should run along.

1363
02:02:03,611 --> 02:02:05,447
Take care.

1364
02:02:07,532 --> 02:02:09,200
Give me a kiss.

1365
02:02:12,954 --> 02:02:17,167
I was so scared,
but I think it went well, don't you?

1366
02:02:18,877 --> 02:02:20,879
Yeah?

1367
02:02:33,266 --> 02:02:37,103
Tommy, if you need to talk,
your dad will listen.

1368
02:02:37,187 --> 02:02:40,065
He's a very smart man, you know.

1369
02:02:40,732 --> 02:02:45,528
Just say, "Dad, I'm confused.
I need to have a talk."

1370
02:02:49,616 --> 02:02:53,286
You know, I met this boy back in
River Oaks where I live.

1371
02:02:53,369 --> 02:02:56,956
He said the Cub Scouts in Houston
are the best ever.

1372
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:01,294
We were never scouts, our mother
was too lazy to check it out.

1373
02:03:03,004 --> 02:03:05,006
No! Stop!

1374
02:03:06,049 --> 02:03:08,093
Come on! Stop it!

1375
02:03:08,176 --> 02:03:09,594
No!

1376
02:03:09,677 --> 02:03:13,681
Listen to me! Listen. It's OK, Tom.

1377
02:03:13,765 --> 02:03:18,561
It's OK. Now...
Hey! Stop it!

1378
02:03:19,562 --> 02:03:24,609
I'm sorry, but I just can't have you
criticising your mother around me.

1379
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:38,725
Mr Horton. Mr Horton?

1380
02:04:38,808 --> 02:04:40,852
She's gone.

1381
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:11,424
Oh, God, I'm so stupid. So stupid...

1382
02:05:11,507 --> 02:05:12,884
Somehow I thought...

1383
02:05:12,967 --> 02:05:16,596
Somehow I thought
when she finally went,

1384
02:05:16,679 --> 02:05:19,182
that it would be a relief.

1385
02:05:20,558 --> 02:05:23,436
Oh, my sweet, little darling!

1386
02:05:30,902 --> 02:05:35,406
Oh, dear. There's nothing harder.
There's nothing...

1387
02:05:46,709 --> 02:05:48,544
Do you want some cake?

1388
02:06:04,769 --> 02:06:08,648
- Why are you standing over here?
- I don't know.

1389
02:06:10,066 --> 02:06:12,944
You wanna come over and sit with me?

1390
02:06:18,950 --> 02:06:22,036
Everything's gonna be
all right, Tommy.

1391
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:44,225
There's fantastic
dance schools in Houston.

1392
02:06:44,308 --> 02:06:49,188
- Tap?
- Tap, ballet, aerobics...

1393
02:06:50,273 --> 02:06:52,149
Anything you want.

1394
02:06:52,233 --> 02:06:54,443
Come over here and see your dad.

1395
02:06:54,527 --> 02:06:57,989
He really knows a pretty girl,
doesn't he?

1396
02:06:58,072 --> 02:07:00,116
She's too old for him.

02:07:00,199 --> 02:07:05,329
Are you eating a wet bunny? Here.
Better go on over to Dad and eat it.

1398
02:07:16,757 --> 02:07:19,594
Hi, Vern. How are you doing here?

1399
02:07:41,574 --> 02:07:43,326
Hi.

1400
02:07:47,622 --> 02:07:50,291
I understand you're a swimmer.

1401
02:07:51,542 --> 02:07:53,377
Me, too.

1402
02:07:53,461 --> 02:07:56,756
But you're an astronaut, right?

1403
02:07:56,839 --> 02:07:59,925
I'm an astronaut and a swimmer.

1404
02:08:02,970 --> 02:08:05,389
Pretty good-looking suit, there.

1405
02:08:07,516 --> 02:08:10,436
A little closer. A little closer.

1406
02:08:11,062 --> 02:08:12,897
A little closer.

1407
02:08:13,022 --> 02:08:15,483
Do you want to see my pool?

1408
02:08:16,609 --> 02:08:21,197
I don't know if the time is right.
You know, funeral and everything.

1409
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:24,533
Oh, I think it is. Come on.

1410
02:08:24,617 --> 02:08:30,581
I'll show you the internationally
infamous... uh... Breedlove crawl.

1411
02:08:30,664 --> 02:08:34,293
Just a little stroke
I picked up out in space.
