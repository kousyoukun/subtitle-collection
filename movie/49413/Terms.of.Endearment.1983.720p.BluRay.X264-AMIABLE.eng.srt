1
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,728
Let me go, just for a minute.

2
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,230
You've been
looking at that baby so much

3
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,065
you're going to stare her
right into a coma.

4
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,775
Stop exaggerating.

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,444
Honey, it's not good for you to be
checking on the baby every five minutes

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,738
and imagining
one terrible thing or another.

7
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:34,701
- I know. I know.
- Here it starts. Here we go.

8
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:38,663
Rudyard... Rudyard, she's not breathing.

9
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,582
Honey, she's sleeping.
The baby's sleeping.

10
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,709
No.

11
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,795
Rudyard, it's crib death.

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,382
It's sleep! She's asleep, honey.

13
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,968
- Maybe.
- Come on!

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,103
Emma!

15
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,647
Good.

16
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,235
That's better.

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,391
No, thank you.

18
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,855
- Thanks. Emma?
- Glad to help.

19
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,027
He was one of the most dependable
men that ever worked for me.

20
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,697
- I know. Thank you.
- He was a good man.

21
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:02,288
Hey, I'm real sorry about your daddy.

22
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,500
Take care of your momma.

23
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,094
Emma. Emma, wake up, please.

24
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,680
- Wake up.
- What's wrong?

25
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:05,226
I was tense. I was tense, and I was
wondering how you were feeling.

26
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,604
- Would you like to sleep in my bed?
- No, thank you.

27
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,525
Would you like
to sleep in my bed again?

28
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,818
Yes!

29
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,138
What are we gonna do with this hair?

30
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,310
Hey, Emma.

31
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,858
Patsy, hurry up!
You're going to miss him.

32
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,325
That's what they were looking at!

33
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,831
- Good night, honey.
- Where's Momma?

34
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,250
She's out back with that old fart
who's trying to get in her pants.

35
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,960
Aren't you gonna wait and see
if the astronaut shows up?

36
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,211
They've got one on every corner
in Houston!

37
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,546
Come on. I gotta get my bus.

38
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,298
- Okay. Say hi to Race for me.
- Okay.

39
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,467
- Okay.
- Love you. Astronauts!

40
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,975
- So?
- We better get going.

41
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,938
I'm gonna say goodbye to my mother.
You want to go with?

42
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,607
No. I don't think I'm up to it today.

43
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,402
Sure would be nice
to have a mother somebody liked.

44
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,584
Why don't you face up to the fact
that you have certain biological needs?

45
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,049
- Because I don't.
- Mom! I'm going now.

46
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,300
Excuse me.

47
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,600
Can you believe it?
He wants to take me to Tahiti.

48
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:14,105
I don't know why you treat these men
like this. They have feelings, too.

49
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,356
You always make so much of things.

50
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,984
- Has the astronaut moved in yet?
- Who?

51
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,277
"Who?"
Is Patsy teaching you coy lessons?

52
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,238
Breedlove, Garrett. Next door.
Has he moved in?

53
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,199
- Put your socks up!
- All right. Come say goodbye to Patsy.

54
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,493
11:00. You be home by 11:00,
and no later than 11:00.

55
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,744
Say goodbye to Patsy.

56
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,329
- Goodbye, Patsy!
- Thank you.

57
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,580
Goodbye, Mrs Greenway.

58
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,594
In this day and age, anything goes!

59
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,500
I feel really foolish getting stoned
to hear Mary Martin.

60
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,211
See, Patsy,

61
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,674
this is not Mary Martin.
This is Ethel Merman.

62
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,980
This is the last time
we're gonna be like this.

63
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,778
I just plain refuse
to get into that kind of thinking, Patsy.

64
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,654
It should not stop.

65
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:51,243
I mean, we're gonna be best friends.
Our babies are gonna be best friends.

66
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,163
We're all gonna grow up
and be best friends.

67
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,124
- Emma?
- Oh, God!

68
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,668
- Just a minute, Ma.
- Open the door.

69
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,420
- Emma?
- Yes.

70
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,131
- Open the door, please.
- Just a minute, Ma.

71
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,508
What do you mean?

72
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,593
- Emma, I need to talk to you!
- All right.

73
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,179
I'm getting married. What the hell?

74
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,853
- Would you meet me in my room?
- Yes.

75
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,941
What do you think she wants?

76
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,277
I don't know. Maybe she's going to
tell you how to have sex.

77
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,739
What? No.
She only knows how to avoid it.

78
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,078
- Okay, hang on.
- I can't believe you just said that.

79
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,206
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it, I swear.

80
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,052
- What have you been doing, Emma?
- Nothing.

81
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,350
What is it, Momma?
I really would like to get some sleep

82
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,478
so I could look halfway decent
for tomorrow.

83
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,151
Come on. What is it?

84
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,070
You wouldn't want me to be silent about
something that's for your own good,

85
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,282
even if it might hurt a little, would you?

86
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,908
Yes, ma'am, I certainly would!

87
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,466
Okay, come on.

88
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,472
Come on.

89
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,158
I've been in here all night.

90
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,872
I've been trying to decide
what wedding gift to get you.

91
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,961
I thought of that Renoir
that my mother gave me.

92
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,842
But I couldn't reach a conclusion.

93
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,511
Then I came to grips with the reason

94
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,097
why I couldn't think
of a wedding gift for you.

95
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,143
Momma, it's all right.
I need dishes of any kind, CorningWare,

96
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:25,064
a rotisserie, the car, a house.

97
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,315
Emma.

98
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,695
I'm totally convinced
if you marry Flap Horton tomorrow,

99
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,365
it will be a mistake
of such gigantic proportions,

100
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,868
it will ruin your life
and make wretched your destiny.

101
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,790
Why are you doing this to me?

102
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,087
You are not special enough
to overcome a bad marriage.

103
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,676
Emma, use your brains.

104
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,429
Flap is limited.
He hasn't got any imagination.

105
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,766
Even at this age,
all he wants is a secure teaching job.

106
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,478
Mother,
I'm marrying Flap Horton tomorrow.

107
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,023
I thank God for Flap
for getting me out of here.

108
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,486
And if this is your attitude, you shouldn't
bother showing up to my wedding.

109
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,202
That's right. No, I think you're right.

110
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,873
The hypocrisy was bothering me, too.

111
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,177
My own mother's
not coming to my wedding.

112
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,417
Listen to her. She's going crazy.

113
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,254
I'll give her until noon tomorrow.
That's about all she can take.

114
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,258
Emma, your mother
boycotted your wedding,

115
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,385
she hates your husband,

116
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,055
and she only holds you
in medium esteem.

117
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:27,269
Medium esteem.
That is so cute. That is so cute.

118
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:35,569
Wouldn't it have been strange if one
of us married a person who didn't read?

119
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,699
God, there's millions of
interesting people out there

120
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,951
who just never pick up a book.

121
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:52,294
Flap, I feel so totally good about us.
I hope I get pregnant tonight.

122
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,838
That would be nice.

123
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,719
Emma.

124
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,142
I love the way you look.

125
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,314
You're so nice.

126
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,196
You're my sweet-ass gal.

127
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,657
Here comes the bride!

128
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,830
How do you... Yeah.

129
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,332
Wait, Flap.
Where did you learn how to do that?

130
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,001
- Quit moving.
- Flap?

131
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,131
That is the strangest music
to make love to.

132
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,674
I know.

133
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,937
Leave me alone. I don't want
to talk to you right now. I'm happy.

134
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,148
I don't want to talk to you.

135
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,318
No. Did you see
the tablecloth Rosie gave me?

136
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,988
It's beautiful. It's got red flowers on it.

137
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,950
Yeah. I think she made it.
No. No, not yet.

138
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,580
No, I made omelettes.
I started 'em. Kind of Tex-Mex.

139
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:57,252
No. That was the worst thing you've
ever done to me in my life, Mother!

140
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,423
Well, I think you owe my husband
an apology.

141
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,344
Until you apologise to my husband,
I'm not listening to any of your gossip.

142
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,263
No. Well, he's right here.

143
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,308
Hold on.

144
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,771
- Yes.
- No.

145
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,941
- Yes.
- No. No.

146
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,484
Yes.

147
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,861
Hello, Mrs Greenway.

148
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,572
No, ma'am,
I am not enjoying your predicament.

149
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,032
Momma, you be nice. I swear.

150
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,620
As a matter of fact,
I don't need or desire an apology.

151
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,376
All I want is for you to understand
and appreciate my position,

152
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,753
to respect our marriage,

153
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:45,551
and to maybe wait another 15 minutes
before you call in the morning.

154
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,932
Yes, I guess I've said my piece.

155
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,560
Okay, I'll put her on.

156
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,729
He's so great! I told you.
I'll talk to you later. All right?

157
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,533
I don't care about the neighbourhood.
Can't you stay a little while longer?

158
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,414
I thought we were having
a real good time, didn't you?

159
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,293
Listen, don't go yet.

160
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:23,046
One more minute. No, I've got
something I want to show you.

161
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,549
No, really.

162
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,685
- Thanks.
- Good night.

163
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,876
- I bought you something.
- What?

164
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:06,965
A tie.

165
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,593
Emma.

166
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,387
You didn't buy this tie for me.

167
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,890
You were worried about
how I was gonna look to your mother.

168
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:19,186
Now I wish you would stop being
such a quisling where she is concerned.

169
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,439
Why is it every time I get happy,
you turn perverse?

170
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,734
- Buying this tie made you happy?
- Yes! Yes!

171
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,364
I wish you could understand this,
'cause you really don't.

172
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,659
I mean, it made me very happy,
buying this tie.

173
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,578
I went to two or three places
before I finally found the right place.

174
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,206
And then describing your jacket
to the salesman

175
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,167
and knowing how perfect it would match
with what you were wearing,

176
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,337
which, by the way, it certainly does.

177
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,256
I mean, it was fun!

178
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,343
It was a goddamn Mardi Gras,

179
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,262
and you're just too dumb
to understand that kind of happiness!

180
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,682
I'm sorry. I'm being terrible.

181
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,268
Going to your mother's,
it makes me a little irrational.

182
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,902
- Can I help?
- Yes. Thank you, Flap.

183
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,322
Would you take this candle to Emma?
I need another one.

184
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,199
- In the kitchen?
- Yes.

185
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,827
That looks great.

186
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,338
Who's that short gentleman?

187
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,802
Not that it's any of your business, but...
Just leave it at that.

188
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,986
What are you looking at?
She isn't there any more.

189
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,612
She'll be back.

190
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,324
I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend.

191
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,703
Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart.

192
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,330
God, isn't she something?

193
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,666
Here she comes.

194
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,295
I met her two weeks ago at church.

195
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,716
I guess you might say
she's God's gift to Vernon Dahlart.

196
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:18,680
- Then you like her?
- Oh, no. Does it show?

197
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,686
Good food.

198
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,732
Well, this is what I used to serve
when I lived in Boston.

199
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,361
Vernon, you haven't said a word.

200
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:37,532
Is that right? I feel like I haven't
stopped talking since I came in.

201
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,994
I guess because
I've been thinking about you so much.

202
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,332
Can I give you a suggestion
on how to handle me, Vernon?

203
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,209
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,086
Don't worship me until I've earned it.

205
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:54,466
Thank you, ma'am.
I appreciate any advice you can give me.

206
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,344
Don't talk with your mouth full, Vernon.

207
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,685
I wouldn't do that, really.
I just did it to make you laugh.

208
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,024
What's wrong with you?

209
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,029
- I got some good news.
- What's that?

210
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,449
I'm unofficially pregnant.

211
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:23,745
We haven't gotten the tests back yet,
but you know me. I'm never late.

212
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,872
Well...

213
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,792
I don't understand.

214
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,966
If you're not happy for me...

215
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,010
I'm gonna get so mad
if you're not happy.

216
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,312
Why should I? Why should I be happy
about being a grandmother?

217
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:55,110
Does this mean you won't be
knitting the baby any booties?

218
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,029
Flap.

219
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,119
Every time you get more
than two drinks in you, you confront me.

220
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:10,125
And I won't have it. I won't have it,
not in this house. Excuse me.

221
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,776
Do you need some help?

222
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:41,489
No. I'll be fine
just as soon as I stretch my legs.

223
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,202
- Oh, God.
- Mr Breedlove.

224
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,335
You're bleeding.

225
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,130
Yeah.

226
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,426
It's okay.

227
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,891
- Come on in.
- No, thank you.

228
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,811
- What are you afraid of, Doris?
- Afraid?

229
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,273
Well, why not...

230
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,363
Why not come on in then?

231
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,699
Because you're much older
than the boys I date,

232
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,868
'cause you're drunk,

233
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,453
and because when I went there tonight

234
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,040
to see a United States astronaut
give a lecture,

235
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,251
I didn't expect him
to prowl after us all night long.

236
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,714
I didn't expect some silly flirt
who had to keep his jacket open

237
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,342
because his belly's getting too big.

238
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,013
I expected a hero.

239
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:04,364
Well, okay, Doris, don't come in.

240
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,325
I don't want you in my house.

241
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,079
Lee Anne, would you like to come in?

242
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,207
You better tend to that cut.

243
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,600
Tommy, show me your belly.
Come on. Come on!

244
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,022
How can you let him run around
dressed like that?

245
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,274
He's adorable. Look at him.

246
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,741
Great, Tommy.

247
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,080
That's Vernon, I'm sure.
So tell him that I'm...

248
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,331
Out?

249
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,751
No. Tell him I'm resting.

250
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,296
Hello? Hi, Flap.

251
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,634
Where? No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.

252
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,688
Flap, you did not expect I'd be happy.

253
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:22,275
Let's be honest with each other
before we start pretending.

254
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,323
Look, Mom's staring at me right now,

255
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,868
so can I talk about it later to you?

256
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,622
Yeah. All right. Bye.

257
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,679
How long you going to
keep this a secret?

258
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,391
The only school that would accept Flap
for his associate professorship

259
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,268
is in Des Moines.

260
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,148
He can't even do the simple things,
like fail locally.

261
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,196
It's gonna be fine, Momma.
It's Des Moines.

262
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,534
- Say, "Bye bye, house."
- Bye bye, house.

263
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,910
All right.

264
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:24,754
Be careful going down these steps.
I don't want you to break your leg.

265
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:33,888
Come here.

266
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,143
Come here. Come here.

267
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,647
Stay sweet, honey.

268
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,399
Rosie.

269
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:50,238
That's enough, Rosie.
They have to get started.

270
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,615
You tell Momma to drive you home
when you work late.

271
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,867
Have some fun, Rosie.

272
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:57,871
Don't act so brave. I know you're gonna
go crazy without me to nag.

273
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,207
You be good to her,
or else we're gonna get you.

274
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,336
I mean it.

275
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,386
Bye, Flap. Have a good drive.

276
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,852
Okay, fingers and toes in.
Take Momma's purse.

277
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,784
Momma, that's the first time
I stopped hugging first.

278
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,953
I like that.

279
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,082
Get yourself a decent maternity dress.

280
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,085
You had to get one in, didn't you?

281
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,589
Will you tell her, Patsy?

282
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,758
She keeps thinking it's me
when I say those things.

283
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,261
Tom.

284
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,308
Are you gonna be good to your mother
and take care of her?

285
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,686
- Bye, Mrs Greenway.
- Goodbye.

286
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,230
Listen, you write
as soon as you get there,

287
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,398
so I'll have your address and all, okay?

288
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,234
You shape up, Patsy.

289
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,737
Dropped my gum.

290
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,657
We'll get you another piece, sweetheart.

291
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,290
The phone bill is gonna be enormous,
you know that?

292
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,003
I'll miss you, Momma.

293
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,428
- Can we go now?
- Yeah. Pull away slow.

294
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:17,051
Honey, I think it's gonna be
so good for us to be away from your...

295
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,722
- Our families.
- I miss Houston.

296
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:27,103
You don't know how lucky you are.
Everybody wants to go to Des Moines.

297
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,731
People come from all over the world

298
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,067
just to get one look at Des Moines
before they die.

299
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,738
Some people say
it's the best city in Iowa.

300
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,367
I know you're teasing me.
Texas is the best!

301
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,954
Well, I think you should stop worrying.

302
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,582
We're going to see some
terrific new things. We are.

303
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,775
Would you please, if you will,
hold it down over there?

304
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,737
Sorry, I can't hear you.

305
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,407
Hold it down! Have some respect
for other people's feelings!

306
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,452
Come over a little closer.

307
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,164
Hey, you in the bush, I can't hear you!

308
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,184
I'm sorry, but I just took a sauna,

309
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,230
and it's real hard not to yell
when you hit that cold water.

310
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:56,025
You're not gonna ignore me
when I speak directly to you?

311
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,237
I'm not ignoring you.
What am I supposed to say?

312
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,782
Okay, it's kind of hard not to yell
when you hit that cold water.

313
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,493
Hey, come here.

314
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:09,831
Come here?

315
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:15,044
- What is your name? Aurora?
- Yes.

316
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,756
You want a shock?

317
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,301
No, not especially. What?

318
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:31,686
Well, we're going to have
this dinner at...

319
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,355
A NASA dinner at the White House.

320
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,443
You know, some cosmonauts
and all of us, and...

321
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,405
I didn't know who I could take.

322
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,241
'Cause all the people that I flew with,

323
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,953
well, their wives would give me
bitch bites all up and down my back

324
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,789
if I showed up
with one of my regular girls.

325
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,543
I didn't know anybody old enough,
so I thought,

326
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,713
"Well, I'll ask my next-door neighbour."

327
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,968
Well, anyway, they cancelled the dinner,

328
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:08,639
but I was really thinking
about asking you out.

329
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,975
Seriously, ain't that a shocker?

330
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,061
Yes.

331
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,316
Imagine you having a date
with someone

332
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,818
where it wasn't necessarily a felony.

333
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,906
Yeah, well...

334
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:30,912
What would you have said
if I asked you? Seriously.

335
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,836
I would have said
I'd like to see the White House.

336
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,254
So you would have come?

337
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:46,969
What the hell? You want to have
dinner out some time?

338
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,764
- No, thank you.
- What about lunch?

339
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,518
You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot, don't you?

340
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,271
You know, there's something
about your manner.

341
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,109
It's like you're trying to toy with me.

342
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,405
That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.

343
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,532
No, this is the element.

344
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,618
- This is exactly...
- Do you want to play, Aurora?

345
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,119
You wanna go to lunch?

346
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,872
We'll have lunch.

347
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,710
Well, if you want to have lunch with me
in some restaurant

348
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,838
so we could improve the atmosphere
in this neighbourhood,

349
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,340
I wouldn't exactly say no.

350
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,428
Come here. We're too far apart to talk.

351
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,819
Now, Aurora.

352
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,698
Since you've agreed,

353
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,910
why don't we just forget
about the rest of it?

354
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,829
I mean, I know how you feel.

355
00:31:54,913 --> 00:32:00,501
There were countdowns
when I had my doubts.

356
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:04,338
But I said to myself,
"You agreed to do it.

357
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:08,175
"You're strapped in,
and you're in the hands

358
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,014
"of something bigger
and more powerful than yourself.

359
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:21,188
"So why not just lay back
and enjoy the ride?"

360
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:27,028
I'm not going.
There is something wrong with you.

361
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,619
God, I'm such a shit.

362
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,916
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That must be it right over there.

363
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:46,005
Right there? Oh, God.
Flap, it's great. Is that it, really?

364
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,675
- I think that's it.
- It's great. Isn't that sweet?

365
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,972
- That was a bump.
- Yeah.

366
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,768
- What is that?
- Shall we go see the house?

367
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,311
You stay here.
I'll come around and get you.

368
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,355
Stay right there.

369
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,231
Come on. Let's get this off.

370
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,360
Come on.

371
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,364
Come on!

372
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,868
Come on, sweetheart.
Did you hurt yourself?

373
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,994
Nope, not yet.

374
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,289
Do you like it? Do you like it?

375
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:25,503
It's great. Flap, it's great!

376
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,796
Oh, my God.

377
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,774
We'll leave the mattress down here.
We can sleep here.

378
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,573
I'm really tired.

379
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,927
You ever made love in lowa?

380
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,435
You know what's great? Tommy's room
is clear on the other side of the hall,

381
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,187
so we can get as noisy as we want.

382
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:29,150
Good. You get to make
your little high-pitched squeak.

383
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,405
Stop it! What about you?
What about you?

384
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:41,203
"Here I come. Here I come again!
Yes! Yes! Yes!"

385
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:47,334
Here I come again. Yes.

386
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:52,465
Yes.

387
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,511
Oh, God. You just made me wet.

388
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,766
How can you do that with your voice,
just like that?

389
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,685
You just make your voice like that.

390
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,688
God, if Tommy can't hear us,
we can't hear Tommy!

391
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,696
- He's fine, mother!
- Don't get pissy. I'll be right back!

392
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:50,981
I have eight or nine papers left to grade.
This isn't love. It's selfishness.

393
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,360
Well, it's been almost a whole week
since we've been together.

394
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,154
I don't think we've gone
a whole week, Flap.

395
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,242
- Sure, we've gone a week.
- No, only in the real pregnant months.

396
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,038
And you're always getting home so late,
Flap. Forget it. Forget it!

397
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,332
Just do me a favour, Flap.

398
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,126
Don't make me feel silly,
I won't make you feel guilty, all right?

399
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,754
Fair enough. I have to hurry.

400
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,967
Be a good boy.

401
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,025
Emma?

402
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,237
I absolutely love that you came back.
You're saving our lives.

403
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,989
You know you're saving
our lives by doing this.

404
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,241
I love that you came back, Flap. I love it!

405
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,702
Tommy, breakfast will be ready
in a minute. You just wait right there.

406
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,287
Let's hurry.
I've got to grade those papers.

407
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,538
God, I just can't believe it.

408
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:52,585
- I'll give everybody a B!
- Come on. Wait! Wait!

409
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,045
Emma, come on!

410
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,643
Hello? Hi, Mother.

411
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,063
Look, could we talk later?
'Cause I've got to get the boys off,

412
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,065
and it's not a good time
for me to be on the phone.

413
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,067
Don't be so inconsiderate.

414
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,944
I'm all set to have
a nice, good talk with you.

415
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,906
Besides, you've got almost an hour
to get the boys off. What's wrong?

416
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,909
- Nothing.
- Stop right here. Tell me what it is.

417
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,415
Okay, Mother. I need some money.
I need you to loan me some money.

418
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,501
I really and truly need it, so will you?

419
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:21,632
Mother, please don't be quiet. You know
how hard that was for me to ask you.

420
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,219
You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.

421
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,889
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was just thinking.

422
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,975
Thinking what?

423
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,060
How much I hate to part with money.

424
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,147
Well, I wouldn't have asked if...

425
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:41,068
Don't yell, but I really think
that I may be pregnant again.

426
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:46,365
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

427
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,200
And you're going to have it, I suppose?

428
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:52,705
Yes, of course.
What's happening to you, anyway?

429
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,457
Don't act like that's so terrible, Emma.

430
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,793
I keep hearing about
lots of bright, young women

431
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,545
who are having simple abortions.

432
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:00,629
Simple?

433
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,880
And then they get wonderful jobs.

434
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,675
You can go right across the state
to Colorado and have it.

435
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,218
I don't know why I tell you anything.

436
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,303
I mean, I seem to like you
less and less, Mom.

437
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,432
You know why, Emma?

438
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,892
It is because I am the only person
who tells you the truth.

439
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,020
Go get dressed, okay?

440
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,442
How is your life gonna get better if you
keep having children with that man?

441
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,653
What miracle is going to come along
to rescue you?

442
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,908
Leave me alone. I need the money.

443
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,201
Why don't you give me
the painting to sell?

444
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,956
No! I won't do that. That's your security.
I will not have you using that for rent!

445
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,378
Let's not do this. All right? All right?

446
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,132
I'll talk to you later. All right?

447
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,557
- All right. If the money would mean...
- No, no, don't give me the money.

448
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:57,061
- It would make you crazy.
- Yes, it would.

449
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:01,690
We'll talk later. You call me tonight
if you want, all right? Goodbye.

450
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,739
Daddy just got home.

451
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,117
Hey, no kidding?
Is it tough being a genius?

452
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,327
Boy!

453
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,596
Great news. I know what my topic is.
I have it all figured out.

454
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,024
What's wrong?

455
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,611
Where have you been all night, Flap?

456
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:53,283
I'm sorry, Ems. I fell asleep
on that big sofa at the library again.

457
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,538
I don't know what's wrong with me.

458
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,374
I'm on to you.

459
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,261
- I'm not doing anything.
- Yes, you are.

460
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,971
I hate it when you
get this unhappy, okay?

461
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,722
We go through this stage every time.

462
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,183
No, no. Don't change the subject.

463
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,519
What's the subject?

464
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,729
That I'm on to you.

465
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,484
You wouldn't try to look so innocent
unless you were guilty.

466
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,487
You're gonna have
to take my word for it.

467
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:31,780
You have no other choice.

468
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,950
No, no, no, no, no.

469
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,373
Excuse me.

470
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:50,883
Emma, you always get a little paranoid
in your first few months, okay?

471
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,093
Just...

472
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,932
If you are doing something,

473
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,269
and you're trying to make me feel
crazy because I'm bearing our child,

474
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,939
then you may have just sunk to a point
so low that you will never recover.

475
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:11,028
You may have just panicked, Flap,
and trying to save yourself,

476
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,740
you've thrown out your character
and your principles.

477
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,909
Now the only way
you could possibly redeem yourself

478
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,911
and be the man
that God intended you to be

479
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,914
is to admit to me anything that
you might have been doing last night.

480
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:25,000
'Cause if you don't do that,
if you don't do that right now,

481
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,920
you are a lost man.

482
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,589
A shell, a bag of shit dust.

483
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:37,304
You've got to tell me.
For us, honey. Come on.

484
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,393
Hello?

485
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,313
Hello, Aurora.

486
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,612
How are you?
Yes, she is. She's right here.

487
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:55,906
Nice to hear your voice again.

488
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,621
I don't know why you don't get a job
if you're worried about money.

489
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,248
What am I going to do with the baby?

490
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,833
It's supposed to be a great day
when you get tenure!

491
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,169
Flap, we don't have enough money
to pay the bills now,

492
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,838
all tenure means is,
we won't have enough money forever!

493
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,508
I don't see why
you don't ask your mother!

494
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,094
That's convenient for you!
I should ask my mother!

495
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,720
Go ahead! Call her!

496
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,139
Why should today be any different?

497
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,351
Get on the phone, Emma!
Get on the phone!

498
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,894
Why don't you call?

499
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,438
Yeah, right. I'm gonna call Aurora, right!

500
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:33,193
Get on the phone! Get on the phone!
Get on the phone, Emma!

501
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:37,572
Get on the phone!
Get on the damn phone!

502
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,828
- Mommy said to wait right here.
- Stay if you want.

503
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:56,800
What are you guys doing here?

504
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,137
I told you to wait out
in front of the house.

505
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,638
Answer me, Tommy.

506
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,724
I didn't want people
to think we live there.

507
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,808
What?

508
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,061
I said I didn't want people
to think we live there.

509
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,024
Cut it out.

510
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,988
Okay. You're allowed to say
one mean thing to me a year.

511
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,450
- That'll do till you're 10.
- You're driving Daddy away.

512
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:26,079
Okay, Tommy. Stand up and follow me.
Don't make me hit you on the street.

513
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,706
Hurry up.

514
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,586
I said hurry. Come on!

515
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:37,716
$44.

516
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,102
Twenty, 30...

517
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,945
Let's see. That's $38.40.

518
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,032
You don't have enough money?

519
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,874
I don't have any cheques. I guess
I'll have to put some things back.

520
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,213
Can I have the register key?
She doesn't have enough money!

521
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,094
It's not such a big thing.
I brought the wrong purse.

522
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,096
Here, take this.

523
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,225
$43.75.

524
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,481
$41.35.

525
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,818
Mom, you promised
I could have something!

526
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,736
I'm not gonna give her
real food, all right?

527
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,197
- Can't you give her this?
- No way!

528
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,157
- $40.35.
- Mom!

529
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,411
All right. Here.

530
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,538
$40.55.

531
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,296
$40.75. Hey, we're going
in the wrong direction.

532
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,800
Why do you have to be
so goddamn nasty?

533
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:05,053
I mean, it's not going to help anything.

534
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,222
We're both people, you know?

535
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,434
$40.75.

536
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,020
I don't need it.

537
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,695
Mrs Horton,
I'm Sam Burns from the bank.

538
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,405
I turned you down on the second
on your house.

539
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:26,616
Of course. I remember who you are.

540
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,244
Look, can I help you make up
the difference here?

541
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,789
Thanks. I'd appreciate it.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

542
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:33,874
Oh, no.

543
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,629
You're a very rude young woman.

544
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,047
I know Douglas from the Rotary,

545
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:44,301
and I can't believe he'd want
you treating customers so badly.

546
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,470
I don't think I was treating her badly.

547
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:49,055
Then you must be from New York.

548
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,648
- Be careful, Teddy!
- What?

549
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,358
Be careful!

550
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,947
- Where's your car?
- Right here.

551
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,742
It was looking like
the worst time I've ever had.

552
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,870
I didn't know I could get
cheered up so fast. I'm grateful.

553
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,747
- No problem.
- Come on, Mom.

554
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,874
- Wait over by the car a second, honey.
- Come on!

555
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,001
- Wait over by the car, honey.
- No! Come on!

556
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,462
- Wait over by the car, honey.
- But...

557
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,090
Wait over by the car, honey!
Over by the car!

558
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,135
Now! Now! Now!

559
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,600
Nice boys.

560
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,604
You're great with them, too. Really.

561
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,692
I think all three of us
are going through a stage.

562
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,779
- Hey, thanks again.
- No thanks required.

563
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,533
- I've had a lovely time.
- Me, too.

564
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,954
- I'll get the money back to you.
- Don't bother yourself.

565
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,748
You could just drop it
in the mail if you like.

566
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,000
- To the bank?
- Sure.

567
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:02,212
You could even use
a cheque-by-mail envelope.

568
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:06,132
Or you could come in. Whichever.

569
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,761
Maybe I'll come in some time.

570
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,724
Well, that'd be fine.

571
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:25,986
- Hey, can I help you with that?
- No, thanks. I'm used to this.

572
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:32,867
And so, another birthday
for a gal named Aurora Greenway.

573
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,330
Even though 50,
she still takes my breath away.

574
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:41,668
Mere mortals just gaze
as she lights up their sky.

575
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,046
A heavenly object, a siren's cry.

576
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,050
You're the best. Happy birthday.

577
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,847
- Thank you, Edward.
- Excuse me, Aurora.

578
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,684
Thank you. Do you want one, Vernon?

579
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,854
Would you like a kiss?

580
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,067
You're not lying about your age,
are you?

581
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,778
Of course not.

582
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,657
I thought you were 52. She's really 52.

583
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:15,619
Come on, Aurora, how do you expect
to fool a family doctor?

584
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,622
- It seems to me she said her age.
- Thank you, Vernon. Thank you.

585
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,791
My point is, the number doesn't matter,
but the effort to conceal it does.

586
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,461
- Rosie, why does he keep talking?
- Dr Ratcher...

587
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,838
Damn it,
I'm trying to do some good here!

588
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,216
- Now, the way to adjust to old age...
- Doctor.

589
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,594
Doctor, I think you're a mite confused,

590
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,012
because of being
recently widowed and all.

591
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,787
You okay?

592
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:09,547
Aurora?

593
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,592
Let's give her some privacy.

594
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:36,616
Yeah? The door's open. Just a minute.

595
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,461
Well, hello.

596
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,089
Hi.

597
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,304
I was curious if you still wanted
to take me to lunch.

598
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,101
I wasn't aware that we...
I don't know what you...

599
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,603
A few years back,
you invited me to lunch.

600
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:07,147
- A few years back?
- That's right.

601
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:11,025
I wondered if the invitation still exists.
Would you like to?

602
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,363
Do lunch.

603
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:18,616
- Not dinner, remember? It was lunch.
- Why not? No.

604
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,201
Good.

605
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:22,996
When?

606
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,334
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

607
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,714
All right. All right.

608
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,508
Good.

609
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,848
- 12:30?
- 12:00.

610
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,434
Good.

611
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,012
Thank you.

612
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,658
If you mind the open air,
I could get the top.

613
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,660
No. Don't worry.

614
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:47,247
Grown women are prepared
for life's little emergencies.

615
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,934
Us going out together. Not bad, huh?

616
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:12,730
Do you think... Do you think
you could possibly put the top up?

617
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,942
The top's at home in the garage.

618
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,916
Hello, there. How are you?

619
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,754
- How are you, Ali?
- Hello. How are you?

620
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,673
It's nice to see you.

621
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:55,773
Fred, that we met at that bar.
He asked me out.

622
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:59,027
- Oh, God.
- We went to the Cadillac Bar.

623
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,278
Have you ever been there?

624
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:04,490
It's a fun place if you're with
the right people, it really is, but I wasn't.

625
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,771
Well, I'm starving!

626
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,691
No hidden meaning in that remark.

627
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,903
Well. Would you like an oyster?

628
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,203
No.

629
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:53,623
- Thank you.
- It's good.

630
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:01,839
I think that is extremely rude,

631
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,343
noticing other women
when you're with me.

632
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:11,182
I think we're going to have to get drunk.

633
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,477
I don't get drunk,
and I don't care for escorts who do.

634
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,607
You got me into this.

635
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:23,236
You're just gonna have to trust me
about this one thing.

636
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,905
You need a lot of drinks.

637
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:28,574
To break the ice?

638
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:33,663
To kill the bug that you have
up your ass.

639
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,502
May I get you something?

640
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:44,090
Yes, I think I will have some bourbon,
preferably Wild Turkey.

641
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,146
- Aurora?
- Yes?

642
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,773
You're not fun, by any chance, are you?

643
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:04,610
I don't really think we should think
about that right now.

644
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,907
Impatient boys sometimes miss dessert.

645
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,759
We both got here at the same time!

646
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,973
Hi, Sam. How are you?
It's nice to see you.

647
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,685
It's always so nice to see you.
I can hardly believe it.

648
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,228
You, too.

649
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,399
What I didn't expect
was that there would be moments

650
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:47,195
where I'd forget to be scared that
someone would see us together.

651
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,572
Sam, you don't have to be scared.

652
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,699
I mean, contemplating sin
is all we've done.

653
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:52,992
It doesn't mean anything.

654
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,455
I'm glad that you've been
contemplating it, too.

655
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,624
I didn't know that.

656
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,293
Well, all these lunches,
all this hand holding?

657
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,461
Emma.

658
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:09,008
I'm not going
back to the bank this afternoon.

659
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:11,844
I have to go out
and inspect a new house.

660
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:17,475
It's pretty far out, and well, it's empty.

661
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,358
- I gotta pick up my kids at 5:00.
- Okay.

662
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,612
Well, I understand.
Look, don't give it a thought.

663
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:32,865
Emma.

664
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,744
I haven't made love to a woman

665
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,208
- in almost three years.
- How come?

666
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,962
My wife has a disc problem.

667
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,549
And she can't take having

668
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,718
any weight on her.

669
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:57,056
Sam, I hope you don't mind me
asking you this,

670
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:01,769
but have you ever thought
of your wife getting on top?

671
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,606
She wouldn't do that.

672
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,024
She may surprise you.

673
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:11,654
No, I don't think so.
It would be so unlike her.

674
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,115
Did you ask?

675
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,825
About 600 times.

676
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,839
What are you thinking?

677
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,967
Tell me, do you prefer Texas to lowa?

678
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,094
Come on, Sam.
What were you really thinking?

679
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:39,348
Really, that's exactly what I was thinking
when you just asked me that.

680
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,394
I don't know. There seems to be
an absence of wildness, you know?

681
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,230
Even in the people!

682
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:50,067
Well, we're farmers, and we talk poor,

683
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:54,113
because the farmer aspect of things is,

684
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,115
"don't let anybody know
you have anything",

685
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,702
and, "don't call attention to yourself".

686
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,329
My wife says...

687
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,249
Well, I guess
we shouldn't talk about Dottie.

688
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:10,463
Wind in the hair! Lead in the pencil!

689
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,677
Feet controlling the universe!

690
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,846
Breedlove at the helm!

691
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,560
Just keep pumping that throttle!

692
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,896
Keep giving it that gas!

693
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:31,817
I see the Gulf of Mexico below me!

694
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:36,572
- I'm not enjoying this!
- Give it a chance.

695
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:42,161
- I am going to stop!
- Fly me to the moon!

696
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:03,766
How are you?
It's not my fault, but I'm sorry.

697
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:09,480
If you wanted to get me on my back,
you just had to ask me.

698
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,418
- My hand!
- Get it out of there!

699
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,086
- I can't! I swear!
- Get it out!

700
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,088
- I swear I can't get it loose.
- Out!

701
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,589
I swear to God!

702
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:38,134
We were having such a good time,
and you had to go do this!

703
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,802
Please...

704
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,389
Please, anything!
Bend down! Bend down!

705
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:52,189
- Why did you have to get drunk?
- I'm not drunk any more!

706
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,067
The pain sobered me up.

707
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:07,913
Oh, no.

708
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,966
Emma, this might be
a terrible thing to ask,

709
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,843
but are you thinking
about your husband at all?

710
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,095
- I was a little.
- We can go back right now.

711
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,264
No, Sam. Stop it.

712
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,767
Look, I want to do this.

713
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,645
I'm glad that I don't know whether
or not Flap's been with someone else.

714
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,565
I'd hate to think that I was doing this
just to get even.

715
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:48,954
Just... Look... Great! Fine!

716
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,624
Great!

717
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:55,711
You're parked in my driveway!
You're breaking the law!

718
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:58,798
Thank you!

719
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,221
Would you like to come in?

720
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:08,140
I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.

721
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:13,896
Everything would have been just fine
if you hadn't gotten drunk.

722
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,109
I was... I just didn't want you to think
I was like one of your other girls.

723
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:22,071
Not much danger in that unless
you curtsy on my face real soon.

724
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,074
Garrett!

725
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:30,329
What is it that makes you so insistent
on shocking and insulting me?

726
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:36,127
I mean, I really hate that way of talking.
You must know that.

727
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,671
Why do you do it?

728
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,133
I'll tell you, Aurora.

729
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:45,594
I don't know what it is about you,

730
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,516
but you do bring out the devil in me.

731
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:00,568
Where are you?

732
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,737
I'm in the laundry room
so nobody could hear me.

733
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:05,614
Yes. But, Sam, I can't hear you either.

734
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,119
Wait a minute.
We're getting a quieter cycle.

735
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,621
- Okay.
- Can you hear me now?

736
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,791
- Yeah.
- Good. Is it bad to call?

737
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:19,628
No, no, I'm definitely in the market
for a little sweet talk.

738
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,589
- Mom, I have to go!
- Just a minute.

739
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,174
- What?
- Really!

740
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,344
Hurry up.

741
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,391
- What is it?
- Just how absolutely good I feel.

742
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:37,021
And even though I'm scared,
and we've committed adultery,

743
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:42,526
no matter what happens,
I'm just so grateful to God or the devil

744
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,907
for letting me feel this way again.

745
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,910
I'm so glad you told me that.

746
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,829
- Don't flush!
- You told me always to!

747
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,831
No, not this time.

748
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,500
Emma, is everything okay?

749
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,085
- Can you talk?
- No, it's all right.

750
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,213
- Can I hold Melanie?
- Yes.

751
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:08,177
- Honey, is everything okay?
- What?

752
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,679
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

753
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,307
- Yeah. Everything's fine.
- Emma...

754
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,351
I have an emergency phone call

755
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,812
from Mrs Aurora Greenway
in Houston, Texas for Emma Horton.

756
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,064
Oh, no!

757
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:23,108
No. She always does that
when the line's busy. It's fine.

758
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,236
- Will you release?
- Of course, Operator.

759
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,737
Sorry, we were just talking.

760
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,949
I'll talk to you later, Sam. Bye.

761
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,203
Hi. How'd it go?

762
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,163
The astronaut is impossible.

763
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:40,292
An arrogant, self-centred,
and yes, somewhat entertaining man,

764
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:45,339
who has realised his ambition and
is at last and forever a spoiled child.

765
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,550
Talk about your match made in heaven.

766
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,636
Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you?

767
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:54,723
I don't think he wants to have
anything more to do with me.

768
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,141
Why?

769
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,227
I don't wanna go into it.

770
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,230
Was it because
you wouldn't go to bed with him?

771
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,982
On a first date, Emma?

772
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,068
It's hardly a first date, Mother.

773
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,988
You've been living
10 feet away from him for 15 years.

774
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,906
Why don't you talk
about the real reason?

775
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:12,324
I don't know what you mean.

776
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,827
Because it's been about that long
since you've done it.

777
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,454
Shut up! I mean it! Shut up!

778
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,582
Come on, it's just me.

779
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,000
- No.
- Call him!

780
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,252
- No, no, no! I'm hanging up.
- No, no. Okay, I'm sorry.

781
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:26,046
- I'm hanging up.
- Call him now! So long.

782
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,407
- Hello?
- Hello, Garrett.

783
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:37,910
Yes?

784
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:43,123
Well, I was just sitting here realising...

785
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,460
Realising that I had
never shown you my Renoir.

786
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,253
What are you talking about?

787
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:53,175
I'm inviting you to come over
and look at my Renoir.

788
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:54,927
You're inviting me to bed.

789
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:58,097
Yes, it happens to be in my bedroom.

790
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,266
Is the Renoir under the covers?

791
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,104
Don't cackle, Garrett.

792
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:11,276
- Do you want to see it?
- Do I want to come to your bedroom?

793
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,031
- Let me think.
- Do you?

794
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:18,867
Just give me a minute.

795
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,205
It's a tough one.

796
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:36,468
Yeah, okay. I guess so. Sure, why not?

797
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,472
I'll see you in a bit.

798
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:44,226
If I don't answer the bell,
that means that the back door's open.

799
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,770
The back door's open.

800
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,518
My God. He ran it.

801
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,552
Hi.

802
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:05,432
I was doing laps when you called.

803
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:11,230
Lucky for us, I only did eight.

804
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:18,737
This is it. This is the Renoir.

805
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,124
I like it.

806
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,545
I like the painting.

807
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,758
I like everything in here.

808
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:43,804
Relax, baby...

809
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,307
Now, just who do you think
you're talking to like this?

810
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,769
Don't you realise I'm a grandmother?

811
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,293
It's not flattering to look too surprised.

812
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,880
I'll just be a minute.

813
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:37,608
- I like the lights on.
- Then go home and turn them on.

814
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,030
I'm sorry.

815
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,735
Come on.

816
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,530
Dad. Come on. Wake up, Dad.

817
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:29,326
- What? What?
- Melanie's sick.

818
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,286
- What?
- Melanie's sick.

819
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:35,832
- The baby's sick.
- The baby's sick?

820
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,962
Are you coming, Flap?

821
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,047
See, Mom, see?
See. What do you think is wrong?

822
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,715
I have to look first.

823
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,803
Come on, Dad.

824
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,981
Thank you.

825
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:02,234
You can go to bed.
She's gonna be all right. She is. Go on.

826
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,821
- I couldn't sleep. So why can't I stay up?
- Go to bed. I'll be there soon.

827
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,823
It's bad enough
we're making this a drama.

828
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,993
It's not going to qualify as high drama.

829
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:12,995
It's okay. It's okay.

830
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:15,914
Thanks.

831
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,503
I'm sure it's the croup.

832
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:24,923
Remember? Tommy had it twice.

833
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,845
Guess you were in the library.

834
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,436
That's the worst sound in the world.

835
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,732
How long do you keep her in here?

836
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,861
Why? Are you going back to bed?

837
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,030
I just asked how long.

838
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:52,034
I don't know.

839
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:56,246
Until her throat clears, or I lose
20 pounds, whichever comes first.

840
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,292
I don't know. About 20 minutes, I guess.

841
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,213
I've been offered a job.

842
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:11,053
What? Why didn't you say something?

843
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,015
I just wanted to think about it.

844
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:20,228
It's head of the English Department
at Kearney State College.

845
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:21,980
It's for about the same money.

846
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,693
- Where is it?
- Nebraska.

847
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,077
I really don't want to move from here.

848
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,913
I love the school, the paediatricians...

849
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,664
It's the head of the department.

850
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:44,377
We'll talk about it, all right?
I like it here, Flap.

851
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:49,633
Head of the department, that's...
That's great.

852
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,265
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye.

853
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,892
Come on, Teddy.

854
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,812
Don't kiss the baby.
She may still be sick.

855
01:14:02,814 --> 01:14:04,856
Have a good day at school.

856
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,616
You don't know the night I had!

857
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,828
Melanie decided to get the croup,
and of course, it happened at 3:00 a.m.,

858
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:20,413
so I don't think
I've even gotten any sleep yet.

859
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:21,790
Anyway, I don't know if he's kidding.

860
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:25,460
Flap told me that he's taking us
to some college in Nebraska.

861
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:27,254
And I'm not sure,

862
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:32,008
but I think Sam is becoming
someone that I need in a strange way.

863
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,679
I'm lying here next to the astronaut.

864
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,265
Are you really?

865
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,226
How was it?

866
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,145
I'll speak to you later.

867
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:46,148
I'll let you go. I feel so good for you.

868
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,608
I do. You call me
as soon as you can. Okay?

869
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:50,235
- Bye.
- Bye.

870
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:53,321
Mel.

871
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,740
Okay, Mel!

872
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:03,039
I just want to make this clear, you know.

873
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,003
I see other women.

874
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,005
I didn't exactly think we were engaged.

875
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,465
- Okay, okay.
- Your ego, really!

876
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,427
Okay. Let's stay in tonight.

877
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,763
- Boy, you're saving a fortune on me.
- I'll cook.

878
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:23,852
It's been three weeks,
and you haven't even seen my house.

879
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,479
My best instincts had me avoiding it.

880
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,237
What are you thinking?

881
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,124
I'll tell you what.

882
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,004
I think this is really sad,

883
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:55,592
that you feel that you need
all this stuff to impress girls with.

884
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,010
Need it?

885
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,305
Sometimes it isn't enough.

886
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,058
I don't think there's anything wrong
with using all your assets.

887
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:08,146
Except, you see, I think that
it turns your profession into a sex trap.

888
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:12,651
Come on. Everybody uses
whatever they have. I earned it!

889
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:16,988
There's 106 astronauts in the whole
fucking world, and I'm one of them!

890
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,908
It's as much a part of me
as anything else.

891
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,118
I'm sorry. I didn't...

892
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:25,997
I didn't mean to trip
on such a deeply felt principle.

893
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,556
Do you want to know what bothers me?

894
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:51,439
None of us ever got together
in one room, locked all the doors,

895
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,234
and compared notes on the experience.

896
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:59,364
I think there was a rule we had to
pretend that it wasn't the fun that it was.

897
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:04,869
You do sense the speed.

898
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:08,415
I remember looking out
the window of the spacecraft.

899
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:15,505
God, I sound like somebody with
a big belly telling stories about Korea.

900
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:19,759
Anyway, this one time,
I'm looking out the window.

901
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:24,055
I see a piece of the spacecraft,
and it's whistling along the ground.

902
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,058
It doesn't make a sound.

903
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:32,731
The only sound you hear,
the only noise in the entire world

904
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,693
is your heart beating.

905
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:45,827
It's indescribable.

906
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:50,707
Anyway, I can't think of a better way
of saying it, but that was it.

907
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,960
That was my moment,
the one that doesn't go away.

908
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,088
You know what I mean?

909
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,299
Yes.

910
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,262
Hey.

911
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,806
This is my moment.

912
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:16,941
No, don't get nervous, Garrett.

913
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:30,955
Flap?

914
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:36,127
Anybody?

915
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,734
You don't think it's love
because we're having fun.

916
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:03,905
Love can be fun.
Would you stop making faces?

917
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,327
That's wonderful.

918
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:12,789
I think what we have here
is a typical grad school girl crush.

919
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:18,002
Would you please, please, please
stop telling me that this is just a crush?

920
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,754
Janice, the whole fun
with getting involved

921
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:23,174
with someone who is unavailable
and a little bit older is that

922
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:26,594
sometimes you get to
hear what's really going on.

923
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,639
- Flap, you are such a...
- Incredible asshole!

924
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,353
Excuse me.

925
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,653
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, buddy!

926
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,030
Emma.

927
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:51,619
God damn it, Emma.
You're gonna ruin us!

928
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,873
- 'Cause you're a spectacle!
- I am not!

929
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,794
Stop jiggling her like that.
She's gonna throw up.

930
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:03,715
Your timing was perfect.
You caught us before we did anything.

931
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,427
I'm taking the car,
and I'm gonna take the kids.

932
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:08,636
I'm gonna go to Houston.

933
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,388
Give me the baby.

934
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:14,601
You don't know what I did.
You don't know.

935
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:17,812
Just like I don't know what you do
on your little afternoon drives.

936
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,272
Take the...

937
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:24,819
Professor Horton,
can I speak to you about my grade?

938
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:27,572
You ought to be happy that I'm going off.

939
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:31,951
If I stayed here, I'd make life hell for you.

940
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,536
Don't follow me.

941
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:40,001
Excuse me. Excuse me.

942
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,260
It's them. It's them!

943
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,694
- Garrett, you're gonna meet Emma.
- No, you don't need outsiders.

944
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,655
- You're no outsider!
- I'll see them later.

945
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:09,781
Please, come with me.

946
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,950
Em, Em, this is Garrett.

947
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,786
- The one...
- Pleasure to meet you.

948
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,996
I've heard so much about you.

949
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:20,291
Your mother's really been
looking forward to this, too.

950
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,836
So, go ahead.

951
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,884
- Anything wrong, Garrett?
- No.

952
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,971
It was very nice to have met you.

953
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:35,682
Must be nice to be home.

954
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,976
It's great. It's great.

955
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,728
I'll be over later.

956
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:44,607
They're probably tired anyway
and will get to sleep early,

957
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:47,110
and I'd like to get to bed early.

958
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,946
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!

959
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:52,782
Come on. Bye-bye.

960
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,118
Come on out. All right.

961
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:57,954
This one likes to squeeze.

962
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,748
Teddy likes to squeeze.
Tommy likes a squeeze.

963
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,084
You both get a squeeze. And...

964
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:07,213
The baby. Where's the baby?

965
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:12,176
There is my baby.

966
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,514
Look at the baby!

967
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:20,518
I keep thinking she looks a little like you.

968
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:25,690
A little? It's like looking in the mirror.

969
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:30,320
She loved the ride.
She hardly cried at all.

970
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:36,242
- Bring in the suitcases.
- Okay.

971
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:39,203
- Mom.
- Well, I talk to you every day.

972
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:45,084
- Mother, you look great.
- And you look terrible.

973
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:49,297
Nobody wants a girl who's washed-out
and tired-looking all the time.

974
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:52,383
I just drove about 1,000 miles.

975
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:55,970
Besides, all the men
love me the way I am, Mother.

976
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:59,974
It's just like you that when you finally
take one small step away from Flap,

977
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:03,394
it's with a married,
unavailable, older lowan.

978
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:11,277
- Tell me about the astronaut.
- We have to talk about it.

979
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:14,572
Are you going to sleep now,
or are we gonna talk?

980
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,254
How's the astronaut, Mother?

981
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,927
Really?

982
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,263
- Oh, really?
- Yes!

983
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:46,187
- He has a name, though.
- You really like him.

984
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,189
Yeah.

985
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,984
Well, it's just so...

986
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:57,240
It's so strange that relatively...

987
01:23:58,117 --> 01:24:02,787
Relatively late in life,
I've found that sex is so...

988
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:06,791
So... So...

989
01:24:07,835 --> 01:24:09,252
So...

990
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:12,296
So fan-fucking-tastic!

991
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,551
Anyway, that's what he calls it.

992
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:37,780
A moth to flame.

993
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:43,453
This affair is going to kill me.

994
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:47,123
No. Maybe not. Why do you say that?

995
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:50,877
Come on, Mom.

996
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:54,797
I never thought I'd start to need him.

997
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,763
You're so lucky you have a pool.

998
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,190
Come on. Stand there. Just stand there!

999
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,030
- Okay.
- Okay.

1000
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:22,700
Let's talk about Los Angeles.
Do you miss it?

1001
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:30,416
It was so interesting
dating Jews after the divorce.

1002
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:32,752
- They are so lively.
- Really?

1003
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,045
Yeah.

1004
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:37,507
In Los Angeles, they were so anxious
to make you feel

1005
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:40,343
as if they understood your secret
thoughts better than anybody.

1006
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:41,552
Patsy!

1007
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:44,055
And I was just glad I had some.

1008
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:47,183
Honey, there's a telephone call for you.

1009
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:49,852
Hello.

1010
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,980
Hi, Flap. How are you?

1011
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,483
I'm fine.

1012
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:02,698
- I guess I look older, like everyone else.
- She does not.

1013
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:08,746
Flap, you sound the same, and I'm not
sure that's such a good thing.

1014
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:11,415
Yeah, she's right here.

1015
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:16,254
No, we have not. We have other things
to talk about besides you.

1016
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:22,093
Hello.

1017
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:25,096
I'm fine.

1018
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:29,433
What's up? Feeling contrite?

1019
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:35,940
You don't seem to understand, Flap.
I saw you together.

1020
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:38,442
What?

1021
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:44,031
You know, Flap, I can't believe
you're doing this to us.

1022
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,953
Well, I think you're spiteful,

1023
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,956
and I don't know
when the hell that happened.

1024
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,419
No! Goodbye. I'll... Goodbye.

1025
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,515
Flap accepted the job
at Kearney, Nebraska.

1026
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,184
I gotta go back.
We're gonna move in a week.

1027
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,687
Emma, I don't know why
you don't leave him.

1028
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,690
Honestly, I don't know, either. He's cute.

1029
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:41,297
I've been packing for us all week.

1030
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:53,100
- Sure remembers her daddy.
- Yeah.

1031
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:57,438
So, are you gonna stay mad?

1032
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:00,441
I think being uprooted with my kids
without my consent

1033
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,527
is at least worth a pout, don't you?

1034
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,532
Come on.

1035
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:11,994
- Head of the department.
- I know. I know.

1036
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:13,371
Here.

1037
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:24,048
- Aurora?
- Garrett! I'm back here.

1038
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:30,054
Well, hello, stranger.
What's it been, about two days?

1039
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,558
Your family still around?

1040
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:37,311
No, they left.

1041
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:42,900
What?

1042
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:00,209
You probably know
what I'm going to say.

1043
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,464
Maybe not. I hope not.

1044
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:11,429
Well...

1045
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:18,811
You're some kind of woman,
but I'm the wrong kind of man,

1046
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:24,108
and it doesn't look like my shot
at being the right kind is

1047
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,861
as good as I was hoping for.

1048
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:33,743
You don't even know
how much you're gonna miss me.

1049
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:38,497
I don't want to blow smoke up your ass.

1050
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,084
What a relief.

1051
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:46,964
It's just that I'm starting
to feel an obligation here.

1052
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:51,927
And it makes it rough,
especially living next door.

1053
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:56,724
I'm starting to think
I gotta watch what I'm doing...

1054
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:13,657
I am gonna miss you.

1055
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:18,162
And I do feel bad.

1056
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:24,418
You're lucky.

1057
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:28,672
I feel humiliated.

1058
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:56,325
Can I have a picture of you?

1059
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:59,537
Well, yeah, but the only one I have
has Flap in it.

1060
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,038
I don't mind.

1061
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,019
Come here. Give me a kiss.

1062
01:31:57,262 --> 01:32:00,639
When you finish this, I need this
kind of type or something close.

1063
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:03,058
- Hello, Emma. Hi, baby.
- Hi.

1064
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,437
She wanted her daddy
to see her dressed up

1065
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:07,521
before she went to the doctor.

1066
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:09,023
He'll be here any minute.

1067
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,233
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

1068
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:16,614
Excuse me.

1069
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:30,085
- Miss?
- Miss?

1070
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:42,806
Don't make me run after you.
I have a toddler here!

1071
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,835
Are you the reason
that we came to Nebraska?

1072
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,297
I think that Flap should talk to you.

1073
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:17,258
We discussed that.

1074
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:21,637
I don't want to say anything
until he does, except that

1075
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:26,183
I don't think there's an emotion
that you're having I couldn't validate.

1076
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:35,442
Tell you what.

1077
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:39,029
If you see Flap,
you tell him that his wife and his baby

1078
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,615
went to the doctor's
to get their flu shots, all right?

1079
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,701
Why don't you do that?

1080
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,040
Just hold still.

1081
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:53,210
That's a good girl.

1082
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:57,506
Okay? You're all finished, all right?
It's all over.

1083
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:03,178
If it makes you feel any better,
Mommy's gonna get a shot, too.

1084
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,764
- Can I give her one of those?
- Sure.

1085
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:08,684
- Here.
- There you go.

1086
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:14,690
Are they gonna tell me in the other room
if my husband calls?

1087
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:17,735
You have a lump in your armpit.

1088
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,696
- How long has it been there?
- I don't know.

1089
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,781
Melanie, stop kicking the cabinet!

1090
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:26,118
There's two of them.
It's not very big, though.

1091
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:30,539
I have to be out of town next week,
and I hate to make it wait that long.

1092
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,833
They should come out and be looked at.

1093
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,085
Come out? Should I be scared?

1094
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:38,714
All it means is, if you're scared, why,

1095
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:40,883
you'll be that much happier
when it turns out to be nothing.

1096
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:45,637
Dr Budge, Mom should get a pop, too,
for her shot.

1097
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:49,892
- Right. Here, Mom.
- Thanks, Mel.

1098
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:52,311
Well, I know what it is.

1099
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:55,606
You don't know how to keep yourself up,
so your sweat glands have clogged up.

1100
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,400
- It's a cyst.
- So I shouldn't worry, right?

1101
01:34:58,485 --> 01:34:59,860
It's a cyst.

1102
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:02,279
It's right where your oil glands are,
and they've clogged up.

1103
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:05,115
You never did know how to eat right,
and you've never learned how to wash.

1104
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,494
You're right. You're right. Thanks.
Talk to Melanie.

1105
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:09,703
- Say hi.
- Hi.

1106
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:13,499
Hello, how are you? I sent you a blouse.

1107
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,667
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

1108
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:19,421
Okay. Say good...
Say goodbye to your mother.

1109
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:32,851
- What's her name?
- Janice. What did the doctor say?

1110
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:35,229
I told you, Flap.

1111
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:38,232
The scariest thing about it
is that he wants to do it so fast.

1112
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:40,984
Janice. With her little folder
under her arm.

1113
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:45,864
"I can't say anything until he does.
We've discussed it, Flap and I."

1114
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:50,244
I mean, really, Flap!
"Validate my feelings". Your taste!

1115
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:53,372
But that thing that the doctor said
about feeling good when it turns out...

1116
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:54,790
No! No, no. Forget about it.

1117
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,875
I'm not gonna make you feel better.
I'm too mad.

1118
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,377
Dinner!

1119
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:17,521
- Dear, you have a malignancy.
- Malignancy.

1120
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:26,905
- Say it again?
- Malignancy.

1121
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:31,618
Rosie.

1122
01:36:33,163 --> 01:36:35,372
Rosie, our girl is in trouble.

1123
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:38,333
She had a cyst, a kind of a cyst,
and it turned out to be malignant.

1124
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:42,963
And they're going to take her
to a hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska.

1125
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,221
We'll release her in a few days.

1126
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:54,099
We do more and more
on an outpatient basis.

1127
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:59,313
We shouldn't need to take her back
here at all unless the illness escalates.

1128
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:03,400
- But you're not telling me anything.
- What are you confused about?

1129
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,653
How is she?

1130
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:10,240
I always tell people to hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

1131
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:15,829
And they let you get away with that?

1132
01:37:15,914 --> 01:37:18,373
Look, you're wrong to take the attitude

1133
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,834
that everything is so desperate
and serious now.

1134
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:24,421
And it won't do your daughter
any good to get those signals, either.

1135
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,429
What's wrong now?

1136
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:37,226
I am so frustrated with that doctor.
But it all boils down to this.

1137
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:40,687
You're getting out of here tomorrow,
and you don't have to stay here again.

1138
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:44,942
Unless the illness spreads.
I really don't feel sick.

1139
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:49,279
Emma. I want you to come to New York
for a visit. My treat.

1140
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:52,533
Great. I mean, we'll have to see.

1141
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:54,701
You guys have to see
these letters from the kids.

1142
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:58,914
Look, Teddy says that he couldn't sleep
at all, but Melanie slept fine.

1143
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:03,210
Tommy says that he really doesn't think
there's anything to be concerned about.

1144
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:07,130
Hey, I mean it! You have some time
before you have to see the doctor again.

1145
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:09,716
Come see New York for a few days.

1146
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:13,887
I don't think it's a bad idea,
have a vacation by yourself.

1147
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:16,098
Rosie and I are here with the kids.

1148
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:18,976
- Take advantage of your freedom.
- I know you wanna go.

1149
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:26,024
This isn't like when they take those kids
to Disneyland right before the end?

1150
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:27,317
Stop!

1151
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,528
- I'm sorry.
- Patsy, I'm kidding!

1152
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:32,030
Okay. Okay.

1153
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:38,453
Do you feel funny
about leaving the kids?

1154
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:42,291
I'm not leaving them.
I'm entrusting them to their father.

1155
01:38:43,626 --> 01:38:47,421
I thought as long as your mother
and Rosie are in town...

1156
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:49,840
Not them. You.

1157
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:05,355
- Emma. Emma, look! Look! Look!
- Are we there yet?

1158
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:09,026
- God! I can't believe I'm here!
- Isn't it beautiful?

1159
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:11,111
Hey, I want you to meet
some of my friends.

1160
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:13,447
Not friends like you and I are friends.

1161
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,534
- Hi.
- Hi.

1162
01:39:18,328 --> 01:39:20,162
Emma, this is Lizbeth.

1163
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:23,332
- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi. It's Lizbeth.

1164
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:25,334
Isn't that what I said?

1165
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:28,503
No, you said "Elizabeth" with an "E".
It's Lizbeth.

1166
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:33,091
- Two names? Liz Beth?
- No, no, one. Lizbeth.

1167
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:35,802
- Lizbeth?
- Never mind.

1168
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:38,972
- And this is Jane.
- Thank heavens!

1169
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:46,480
- Here, that's Melanie.
- Look at that!

1170
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:49,816
Teddy's the younger one,
and Tommy's the older one.

1171
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:56,448
- The little girl, she's incredible.
- Yeah, don't think she doesn't know it.

1172
01:39:56,532 --> 01:40:00,702
Patsy's got a real thing going with her.
I mean, the boys, too.

1173
01:40:00,787 --> 01:40:03,830
Are you gonna wait till she's in school
before you go back to work?

1174
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,999
I never really worked.

1175
01:40:07,794 --> 01:40:11,463
- Well, that's okay.
- Thanks.

1176
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:15,967
Great.

1177
01:40:20,306 --> 01:40:22,307
When did she find out?

1178
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:25,936
- About a month ago.
- There.

1179
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:32,234
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1180
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:34,152
It was a great honour
meeting you, Emma.

1181
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:36,488
- I hope you have a wonderful time here.
- Thank you.

1182
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:41,326
I think those beautiful children are lucky
to have you for a mommy.

1183
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:44,121
Y'all go ahead. Take the first cab.
We're not in a hurry.

1184
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:47,207
- You sure?
- Yeah. That's fine.

1185
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,542
See you.

1186
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:50,669
- Bye bye, Patsy.
- Bye, darling.

1187
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:58,176
- You told them, didn't you?
- You don't mind, do you?

1188
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,137
Of course not.

1189
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:05,100
Emma, come on. They're jerks.
They don't know anything.

1190
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:06,977
Why do those women
have to act like that?

1191
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:08,854
Emma, talk to me!

1192
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:12,816
It's not you, Patsy. I don't care.
I don't mind them knowing.

1193
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:20,532
In less than two hours, two of them
told me that they'd had abortions.

1194
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:23,744
Three of them told me
they were divorced.

1195
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:26,329
One hasn't talked to her mother
in four years.

1196
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:29,541
And the one that has her little Natalie
in a boarding school

1197
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:32,627
because she has to travel for her job?

1198
01:41:32,712 --> 01:41:34,921
I mean, hell, Patsy!

1199
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:40,093
The one with the yeast disease
that thought she had vaginal herpes?

1200
01:41:40,178 --> 01:41:43,889
If that's fit conversation for lunch,

1201
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:48,101
what's so god-awful terrible
about my little tumours?

1202
01:41:49,395 --> 01:41:53,482
Yeah, of course, but...
What do you want me to do?

1203
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:57,277
I want you to tell them it ain't so tragic!

1204
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:01,031
People do get better.

1205
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:05,577
Tell them it's okay
to talk about the cancer!

1206
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:14,503
Patsy tells us you have cancer.

1207
01:42:18,216 --> 01:42:19,424
We should really talk later.

1208
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:22,928
I'm a nutritionist,
and my husband's with Ticketron.

1209
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:26,723
Thanks, Patsy.

1210
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:29,726
- Hello.
- Hello, Flap?

1211
01:42:29,811 --> 01:42:31,394
- Yes.
- Have you heard anything?

1212
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,357
No. Emma hasn't called you either?

1213
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:38,193
No. How are the children?

1214
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,654
I wish I were so carefree.

1215
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:43,198
Yes, well, they don't have anything
to feel ashamed about.

1216
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:46,243
You know something, Aurora?

1217
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:48,620
You always seem
to lose your manners around me.

1218
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:51,706
Stop it, Flap. Let me know if you hear.

1219
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,167
And if you talk to Emma, don't sound
as frightened as you do to me.

1220
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:56,169
I don't sound frightened!

1221
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,340
Daddy.

1222
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:14,020
Hi, Mother. Look, they're having this
party for me, so I can't talk for very long.

1223
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:17,440
But I think I'm coming home
a few days early.

1224
01:43:20,069 --> 01:43:21,444
Not really.

1225
01:43:25,074 --> 01:43:27,200
It's about time they gave us this room.

1226
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:29,578
God, Mother, I can't believe you did this.

1227
01:43:29,662 --> 01:43:30,829
- It's great.
- Sure.

1228
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:35,292
Careful there! These are worth more
than you'll ever make in your lifetime.

1229
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:39,504
I grew up with her my whole life.
You can take it for a couple of minutes.

1230
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:42,007
This is fine. Thank you so much.

1231
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:44,885
Thank you.

1232
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:53,977
- They're wonderful!
- They look good next to each other.

1233
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:07,073
Help me with this, Melanie.
Gorgeous isn't everything.

1234
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:10,410
This one. This one. Two more.

1235
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:19,336
The response to the drugs we tried

1236
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:22,380
isn't what we hoped.

1237
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:27,218
But there are investigatory drugs
which we are willing to utilise.

1238
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:31,056
However, if you become incapacitated,

1239
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:35,685
or it becomes unreasonable for you
to handle your affairs for a block of time,

1240
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:39,981
it might be wise
to make some decisions now.

1241
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:49,199
- Any questions?
- No.

1242
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:56,831
I know what you're saying.

1243
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,876
I have to figure out
what to do with my kids.

1244
01:45:22,066 --> 01:45:25,819
Excuse me. It is after 10:00.
Give my daughter the pain shot, please.

1245
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:27,904
Mrs Greenway, I was going to.

1246
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:29,698
- Good. Go ahead.
- Just a few minutes.

1247
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:32,909
Well, please. It's after 10:00.
It's after 10:00.

1248
01:45:32,994 --> 01:45:35,328
I don't see why
she has to have this pain.

1249
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:36,413
Ma'am, it's not my patient.

1250
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:38,957
It's time for her shot!
You understand? Do something!

1251
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:41,710
All she has to do is hold on until 10:00.

1252
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:45,880
And it's past 10:00. She's in pain!
My daughter's in pain!

1253
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:48,508
- Give her the shot! Do you understand?
- Are you going to behave?

1254
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,136
Give my daughter the shot!

1255
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:57,934
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1256
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:06,526
Can I have 222, please?

1257
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:31,634
Let's get her!

1258
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:33,803
Pushing Grandma in
isn't a half bad idea.

1259
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:36,097
Don't you dare! I mean it.

1260
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:39,976
Come on.

1261
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,481
- Say, "Hi, Granny."
- Hi, Granny.

1262
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,107
Aurora?

1263
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:20,600
Well...

1264
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:26,022
Who would have expected you
to be a nice guy?

1265
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:43,915
- Who?
- It's good to see you.

1266
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:03,309
Take care of yourself. I'll call you.

1267
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:12,652
- I'm real glad I came.
- Your coming meant a lot to Emma.

1268
01:48:13,571 --> 01:48:16,072
It meant a lot to me, Garrett.

1269
01:48:17,449 --> 01:48:19,909
I'll be at the hospital all the time.
I'll call you.

1270
01:48:19,994 --> 01:48:21,619
No, if I do that,
and there's someone there,

1271
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:23,705
I'll hear that funny sound in your voice.

1272
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:26,499
I don't care. Who cares? I don't care.

1273
01:48:26,584 --> 01:48:28,918
I'm glad you came. I love you.

1274
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:50,732
Garrett!

1275
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:53,318
Come here.

1276
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:00,491
I was curious.

1277
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:04,537
Do you have any reaction at all
to my telling you I love you?

1278
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:07,498
I was just inches from a clean getaway.

1279
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:10,919
Well, you're stuck, so face it.

1280
01:49:14,423 --> 01:49:18,134
I don't know what else to say
except my stock answer.

1281
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:23,473
- Which is?
- I love you too, kid.

1282
01:49:44,328 --> 01:49:45,787
Goodbye.

1283
01:49:55,839 --> 01:49:58,800
I took him to the airport,
and we were standing there

1284
01:49:58,884 --> 01:50:03,346
in front of the door hugging,
and kissing and saying goodbye.

1285
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:06,140
- And you know what?
- What?

1286
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:10,895
I got up the nerve to tell him I loved him.

1287
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,939
You know what
his reaction was, Emma?

1288
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:15,358
I don't give a shit, Mom. I'm sick.

1289
01:50:19,697 --> 01:50:24,450
Not everything has something to do
with you. I've got a lot to figure out.

1290
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:30,164
- I just don't wanna fight any more.
- What do you mean? When do we fight?

1291
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:34,419
"When do we fight?" You amaze me.

1292
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:38,089
I always think of us as fighting.

1293
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:40,258
That's just from your end.

1294
01:50:40,342 --> 01:50:43,219
That's 'cause you're
never satisfied with me.

1295
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:48,451
- Have you seen her yet today?
- Yes.

1296
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:53,122
I've been with her most of
last night and today, as usual.

1297
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:58,795
I haven't really talked to the kids yet.

1298
01:52:00,798 --> 01:52:02,215
I'm not sure how much they realise,

1299
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:05,468
but they know
something bad is happening.

1300
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:07,303
Flap.

1301
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:11,849
Patsy wants to raise Melanie
and maybe the boys.

1302
01:52:12,518 --> 01:52:16,270
I think they should be with me,
don't you?

1303
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:19,273
What can you be thinking about?

1304
01:52:19,358 --> 01:52:23,069
Raising three children,
working full time and chasing women

1305
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:25,988
requires a lot more energy
than you have.

1306
01:52:26,073 --> 01:52:27,949
You know, one of the
nicest qualities about you

1307
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:31,536
has always been that you recognised
your weaknesses.

1308
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:34,455
Don't lose that quality now
when you need it the most.

1309
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:44,924
You have no right nor any invitation

1310
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:50,012
to discuss where
or how my children live.

1311
01:53:09,074 --> 01:53:12,869
From what the doctor says,
it's time that we have the talk now.

1312
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:17,540
Do you know how much I hate
the idea of losing you?

1313
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:21,377
Yes.

1314
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:27,592
Well, nobody...
Nobody seems to know that except you.

1315
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:32,138
- I... Well...
- What?

1316
01:53:33,974 --> 01:53:38,352
I'm thinking about my identity
and not having one any more. I mean...

1317
01:53:38,437 --> 01:53:40,813
Who am I, if I'm not the man
who's failing Emma?

1318
01:53:41,190 --> 01:53:44,942
- You didn't fail me, Flap.
- I don't wanna talk about this.

1319
01:53:45,027 --> 01:53:48,237
I feel like I'm sucking after forgiveness,
which I probably am.

1320
01:53:49,531 --> 01:53:52,158
You were no more terrible than I was.

1321
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:53,784
No. Except for the cheating.

1322
01:53:56,622 --> 01:53:58,956
You're right. Let's not do this.

1323
01:54:01,502 --> 01:54:03,002
Look, we had problems.

1324
01:54:03,086 --> 01:54:06,130
It was never over
whether we loved each other.

1325
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:15,598
Oh, God! That tie!
I can't believe you wore that!

1326
01:54:16,308 --> 01:54:18,768
God, the mess it must've been
for you to find it.

1327
01:54:18,852 --> 01:54:23,731
The house still isn't in one piece.
It was in the last box I looked in.

1328
01:54:23,815 --> 01:54:25,149
I'll bet.

1329
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,445
God, you're easy to please.

1330
01:54:31,114 --> 01:54:33,783
I don't know why I couldn't do more of it.

1331
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:37,787
I'm so glad we're talking, I just am.

1332
01:54:38,956 --> 01:54:42,333
It just means so much to me that
we can still feel like this, so much.

1333
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:44,627
I swear...

1334
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:50,800
Listen, I am getting tired.

1335
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:56,097
Just tell me, hon,
you really want to raise 'em?

1336
01:55:09,486 --> 01:55:13,614
I never thought I was the sort of man
who'd give up his kids.

1337
01:55:13,699 --> 01:55:15,366
It's a lot of work.

1338
01:55:17,244 --> 01:55:21,330
As hard as you think it is,
you end up wishing it were that easy.

1339
01:55:24,209 --> 01:55:26,043
Where do you want them?

1340
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:28,796
I don't want them to end up with Janice.

1341
01:55:31,216 --> 01:55:32,967
Well, she's not so bad.

1342
01:55:39,016 --> 01:55:42,435
I really don't think
they should be with you, honey.

1343
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:53,362
Well, to tell you the honest truth,

1344
01:55:56,533 --> 01:55:58,159
I'd probably screw it up.

1345
01:56:02,664 --> 01:56:04,373
I'll really miss them.

1346
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:13,299
Well, maybe we should let
Patsy take them.

1347
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:17,720
Because it'd be very easy for me
to work research summers in New York.

1348
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:22,725
No. Patsy really only wants Melanie.
Mother should have them.

1349
01:56:24,645 --> 01:56:26,646
You can see them any time you want.

1350
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:29,315
Y'all will decide things
for them and everything.

1351
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:32,652
- Emma, she can make that very difficult.
- She won't.

1352
01:56:37,824 --> 01:56:41,577
Well, I guess they should be
with your mother.

1353
01:56:43,705 --> 01:56:45,581
I probably have that coming.

1354
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:07,061
Flap, will you bring
the boys by tomorrow?

1355
01:57:08,063 --> 01:57:12,024
I've got that one waiting for me.
I gotta do it.

1356
01:57:12,109 --> 01:57:14,610
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

1357
01:57:25,914 --> 01:57:28,749
Come on, Pats. I gotta get ready.

1358
01:57:28,834 --> 01:57:31,502
Patsy. Make-up!

1359
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:38,884
Is it terrible for me to say that
I can't stand seeing your mother

1360
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:40,594
get her hands on that little girl?

1361
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:43,472
I'd just love to raise that little girl.

1362
01:57:49,604 --> 01:57:52,982
Look, I'd let you,
but Teddy couldn't spare her.

1363
01:57:55,235 --> 01:57:57,737
I can't stall any more, all right?

1364
01:57:57,821 --> 01:58:00,656
You go out there and send the boys in.

1365
01:58:01,575 --> 01:58:04,326
- Well, do I get to say something ever?
- No.

1366
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:11,333
We don't have to do that, right?
Come here.

1367
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:18,799
You'll be fine. You will.

1368
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:26,849
It's just this.

1369
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:32,146
You're my touchstone, Emma.

1370
01:58:34,816 --> 01:58:36,025
The boys.

1371
01:59:19,277 --> 01:59:22,071
Hi. Come on.

1372
01:59:23,657 --> 01:59:26,992
I love you. I miss you.
God, I want you to come home.

1373
01:59:28,578 --> 01:59:30,788
Close the door.

1374
01:59:30,872 --> 01:59:33,582
Guys, you both look so gigantic to me.

1375
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,587
- I guess I look pretty bad to you.
- Not so bad.

1376
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:47,137
You both have beautiful eyes,
and your hair's too long.

1377
01:59:47,222 --> 01:59:50,641
I don't care how long it gets in the back,
but keep your bangs cut, okay?

1378
01:59:50,725 --> 01:59:53,561
- It's too long.
- That's a matter of opinion.

1379
01:59:54,896 --> 01:59:57,523
Just keep it short, all right?

1380
01:59:57,607 --> 01:59:58,983
Are you getting well?

1381
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:04,280
Look up.

1382
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:07,867
I'm sorry about this, but I can't help it.

1383
02:00:07,951 --> 02:00:11,745
And I can't talk to you for too long,
or I'll get real upset.

1384
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:16,125
I want you to make a lot of friends.

1385
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:19,587
And I want you to be real nice
to the girls,

1386
02:00:19,671 --> 02:00:22,673
'cause they're going to be
real important to you, I swear.

1387
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:26,427
We're not afraid of girls.
What makes you think that?

1388
02:00:26,511 --> 02:00:29,430
- Well, you may be later on.
- I doubt it.

1389
02:00:29,514 --> 02:00:32,558
- Why don't you shut up? Shut up!
- You shut up.

1390
02:00:33,018 --> 02:00:35,436
Teddy, give me a kiss. Come on.

1391
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:42,276
Tommy, you be sweet. Be sweet.

1392
02:00:44,321 --> 02:00:48,282
And stop trying to pretend
like you hate me. I mean, it's silly.

1393
02:00:49,618 --> 02:00:50,826
I like you.

1394
02:00:51,494 --> 02:00:53,662
Okay, then will you
listen especially close?

1395
02:00:53,747 --> 02:00:54,747
What?

1396
02:00:54,831 --> 02:00:56,916
- You'll listen real hard?
- I said, "What?"

1397
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:02,254
I know you like me. I know it.

1398
02:01:04,341 --> 02:01:08,135
For the last year or two, you've been
pretending like you hate me.

1399
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:13,849
I love you very much.
I love you as much as I love anybody,

1400
02:01:14,643 --> 02:01:16,685
as much as I love myself.

1401
02:01:17,354 --> 02:01:19,563
And in a few years,
when I haven't been around

1402
02:01:19,648 --> 02:01:21,607
to be on your tail about something
or irritating you,

1403
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:23,943
you're gonna remember.

1404
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:26,111
You're gonna remember that time
I bought you the baseball glove

1405
02:01:26,196 --> 02:01:31,367
when you thought we were too broke,
or when I read you those stories,

1406
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:36,038
or when I let you goof off instead of
mowing the lawn, lots of things like that.

1407
02:01:37,165 --> 02:01:40,125
And you're gonna realise
that you love me,

1408
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:44,505
and maybe you're gonna feel badly
because you never told me, but don't.

1409
02:01:47,676 --> 02:01:49,218
I know that you love me.

1410
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:54,682
So don't ever do that
to yourself, all right?

1411
02:01:54,766 --> 02:01:55,849
Okay.

1412
02:01:57,394 --> 02:01:59,728
- Okay?
- I said, "Okay."

1413
02:02:03,775 --> 02:02:07,194
Okay, you two should run along.
Take care.

1414
02:02:09,864 --> 02:02:11,365
Give me a kiss.

1415
02:02:15,245 --> 02:02:18,789
I was so scared,
but I think it went really well, don't you?

1416
02:02:21,251 --> 02:02:22,334
Yeah?

1417
02:02:35,432 --> 02:02:38,976
Tommy, if you need to talk,
your dad will listen.

1418
02:02:39,853 --> 02:02:42,855
He's a very smart man, you know.

1419
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:44,356
All you have to do is
go up to him and say,

1420
02:02:44,441 --> 02:02:47,151
"Dad, I'm confused.
I need to have a talk."

1421
02:02:51,781 --> 02:02:55,659
You know, I met this boy
back in River Oaks where I live.

1422
02:02:55,744 --> 02:02:59,121
He was telling me that the Cub Scouts
in Houston are the best ever.

1423
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:03,125
We were never Scouts. Our mother
was too lazy to check it out.

1424
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:07,212
No! Stop!

1425
02:03:08,506 --> 02:03:10,340
Come on! Stop it!

1426
02:03:10,425 --> 02:03:11,592
No!

1427
02:03:12,052 --> 02:03:15,929
Listen to me! Listen. It's okay, Tom.

1428
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:19,975
It's okay. Now... Hey! Stop it!

1429
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:26,106
I'm sorry, but I just can't have you
criticising your mother around me.

1430
02:04:38,138 --> 02:04:42,599
Mr Horton. Mr Horton? She's gone.

1431
02:05:10,795 --> 02:05:14,756
Oh, God, I'm so stupid. So stupid.
Somehow I thought...

1432
02:05:15,884 --> 02:05:18,719
Somehow I thought
when she finally went,

1433
02:05:18,803 --> 02:05:20,888
that it would be a relief.

1434
02:05:22,765 --> 02:05:25,767
Oh, my sweet, little darling!

1435
02:05:33,193 --> 02:05:37,279
Oh, dear. There's nothing harder.
There's nothing...

1436
02:05:49,125 --> 02:05:50,584
Do you want some cake?

1437
02:06:07,018 --> 02:06:10,646
- Why are you standing over here?
- I don't know.

1438
02:06:12,523 --> 02:06:15,567
Come on. You wanna come over
and sit with me?

1439
02:06:21,241 --> 02:06:23,951
Everything's gonna be all right, Tommy.

1440
02:06:41,344 --> 02:06:45,889
There's fantastic dance schools
in Houston.

1441
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:51,270
- Tap?
- Tap, ballet, aerobics.

1442
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:56,692
Anything you want.
Come over here and see your dad.

1443
02:06:56,776 --> 02:06:59,653
He really knows a pretty girl,
doesn't he?

1444
02:07:00,321 --> 02:07:02,322
She's too old for him.

1445
02:07:02,407 --> 02:07:07,369
Are you eating away at bunny? Here.
Better go on over to Dad and eat it.

1446
02:07:18,881 --> 02:07:22,009
Hi, Vern. How are you doing here?

1447
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:52,080
I understand you're a swimmer.

1448
02:07:53,958 --> 02:07:57,419
- Me, too.
- But you're an astronaut, right?

1449
02:07:58,838 --> 02:08:01,131
I'm an astronaut and a swimmer.

1450
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:07,596
Pretty good-looking suit, there.

1451
02:08:09,724 --> 02:08:12,100
A little closer. A little closer.

1452
02:08:13,561 --> 02:08:15,103
A little closer.

1453
02:08:15,605 --> 02:08:17,773
Do you want to see my pool?

1454
02:08:18,983 --> 02:08:23,528
Well, I don't know if the time is right.
You know, funeral and everything.

1455
02:08:23,613 --> 02:08:27,032
I think it is. Come on.

1456
02:08:27,116 --> 02:08:32,162
I'll show you the internationally
infamous Breedlove crawl.

1457
02:08:33,623 --> 02:08:36,958
Just a little stroke
I picked up out in space.
