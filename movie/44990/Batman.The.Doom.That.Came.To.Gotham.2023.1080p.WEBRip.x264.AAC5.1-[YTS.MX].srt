3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,560
(Kai Li over radio)
Saint Bay, do you copy?

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Come in, Saint Bay.

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,560
Argo to Saint Bay station.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
Argo to Saint Bay station.
Come in, Saint Bay.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,735
(man over radio)
This is Saint Bay station. Come in, Argo.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,760
This is Kai Li Cain
from the Wayne expedition.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,560
We've found the Cobblepot base camp...

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,480
or what's left of it.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,200
Mr. Wayne is with Grayson and Tawde
looking for survivors.

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,040
Dick, Sanjay, report.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
It's bad, sir. Nothing but dead bodies.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,040
Yeah. Heaps of 'em.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,840
We found the ship's manifest, sir.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
We're still two short.
Someone named Grendon,

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,320
and then Cobblepot himself.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,600
Not to go grummy, Mr. Wayne,

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,960
but the odds of anyone
surviving out here...

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
We keep looking.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,160
Professor Cobblepot's journal?

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
(Cobblepot) 'Expedition day three.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Men are on edge.

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,720
The dogs will still not leave the ship.

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
It's this place.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
They fear it.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,800
And I must confess...

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,960
I don't blame them.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Day seven...

30
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Things are worse.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,880
Could not calm the dogs.

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,760
Forced to kill them all.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,640
Grendon has disappeared.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
Has gone mad, I fear.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
And the others, they won't speak.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
They refuse to even move.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,680
Day ten, just me now.

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,080
When I close my eyes...

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,480
I hear it calling.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
From the ice.'

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
(Bruce) Cobblepot?

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,280
(Cobblepot) 'It tells me it's coming.'

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
(Bruce) Professor Cobblepot! Oswald!

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
(screams)

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
(groaning)

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,240
(Cobblepot) 'It tells me...

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,280
I have come home.'

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,000
(ice clacking)

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,960
(ice scraping)

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Cobblepot?

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,920
(man) Cobblepot is no more.

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
He's something else now.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
He's become
what he was always meant to be.

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,240
I take it you're Grendon.

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
(Grendon) Was Grendon. Once.

56
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,200
Now I'm chosen by him

57
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,520
to be his messenger to the world.

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,400
I see. And who is 'him', exactly?

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,280
Him is he who bays and slavers
forever outside time and space,

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,880
who shambled down out of the stars

61
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,720
when Earth new and spawned abominations
in the seas and blights upon the land.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,120
Woe to man when he comes again.

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
(Bruce screams)

64
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,560
(Grendon) To gaze upon his form
is to invite madness.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,640
That is why, in order to serve him,
I chose to make...

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,960
adjustments.

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
You're gonna come with me.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Now!

69
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
No. No!

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,520
- I'm not finished yet.
- (creature screeching overhead)

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,120
(grunting)

72
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,520
(gasping)

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
(grunting)

74
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,360
(breath trembles)

75
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,200
(groaning)

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,720
- (creature screeching)
- (grunting)

77
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,240
(Grendon yelling)

78
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
(Grendon groans)

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Hark...

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,400
The lurker is on the threshold.

81
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
And behold...

82
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
It...

83
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Is...

84
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Coming.

85
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,840
(jazz music playing)

86
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,160
(Bruce over radio) Shore party to Argo.

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
This is Argo. Go ahead.

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,680
Kai Li, ready the explosives.

89
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,840
Uh, did you say explosives?

90
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
I mean, sure, Mr. Wayne. How many?

91
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
All of them.

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,120
Whoo! Hot dog!

93
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,160
Nothing'll get into or out of that cave
ever again.

94
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,680
You sure sealing it off was wise?

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,375
The scientific value of a prehistoric
creature like the one you described...

96
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,320
Is far less than the danger it posed.

97
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,760
That thing has infected
the surrounding wildlife here

98
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
with some sort of mutational agent.

99
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,840
A virus that must've lain dormant
for millennia.

100
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
And it's quite possible,

101
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,920
it infected some of
the Cobblepot party as well.

102
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
(gasps)

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,240
So, whatever that creature was, Dick,

104
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
it was meant to stay buried.

105
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,720
Sir, what about Cobblepot?

106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Did you ever find him?

107
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
(Bruce) Cobblepot's gone.

108
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,080
(grunting)

109
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,040
Heavens, what is that ghastly smell?

110
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,960
That would be your friend, Grendon.

111
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,280
Once we warmed him up,
he started to spoil.

112
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
Spoil?

113
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
The old palooka's dead as a donkey.

114
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Right, Dicky?

115
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,455
The tissue samples I took from him
appear to be dead,

116
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,800
- but I'm sure there's a logical...
- Logical explanation.

117
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,680
You know, ace, you're starting to sound
more like the big cheese every day.

118
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,480
May I ask where this rather loquacious
cadaver is, presently?

119
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
Until Dick can whip up something
to keep the body frozen,

120
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,760
Mr. Wayne had us put him on ice.

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,640
He instructed me to put Mr. Grendon
in the meat freezer, Alfred.

122
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,360
I do so look forward to fetching
this evening's roast.

123
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
(Bruce) 'Though I am strayed,

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,520
my Testament shall remain in Gotham.

125
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,040
-Forever in my keep.'
-(door opens)

126
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,200
Master Bruce, about this Grendon.

127
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,840
- Perhaps it's time for another...
- Gotham is in danger.

128
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
You gleaned that
from Cobblepot's journal, sir?

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sure of it now.

130
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,760
But from what you told me,

131
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,600
the professor was not of sound mind.

132
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,440
Believe me, Alfred,
I took that into consideration.

133
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,280
Unhinged rantings aside, his journal
confirms much of what I've uncovered

134
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
about the existence of an ancient cult.

135
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,000
And if any of what he writes is true,

136
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,840
it's a cult that has long ties to Gotham.

137
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,480
Then should I take this to mean...

138
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,280
It's been 20 years since we left, Alfred.

139
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,680
Twenty years preparing.

140
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
And now...

141
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
It's time.

142
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
We're going home.

143
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,320
(horn bellows)

144
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
How long you figure we'll be in Gotham?

145
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,720
We're here for good, kid.

146
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
(Kai Li) Horsefeathers!

147
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,640
In the two years I've been with you

148
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,280
we haven't stayed in any city
for more than a few weeks.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Come to think of it...

150
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,680
I've never stayed in any city
for more than a few weeks.

151
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,280
I've been traveling with Bruce
coming on a decade now, Kai Li.

152
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,360
And it's always been about returning
to Gotham.

153
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,760
Okay, but returning for what?

154
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,080
- (chuckles)
- (groans)

155
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
(sinister chuckling)

156
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,600
Doom.

157
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
You return for your doom.

158
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,280
Nuts to you, ya rank spud.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
It appears Gotham has become a bit more...

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,880
Untended than we remember it.

161
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Let's hope
it's nothing like I remember it, Alfred.

162
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,640
(Thomas) Gotham's history
is our history, son.

163
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,360
Wayne family history.

164
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
The Waynes built this city, Bruce.

165
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,120
That makes you part of a long legacy.

166
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
What's a legacy?

167
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,840
It means, one day,
you'll have very big shoes to fill.

168
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,360
Come now, Martha.

169
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,360
It's more important a man learn
to stand on his own feet

170
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,840
before cramming them
into someone else's shoes.

171
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
Isn't that right, son?

172
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
We have brought this curse upon us!

173
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,400
(both grunting)

174
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Thomas!

175
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
(groans)

176
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,560
Bruce, run! Just... (groans)

177
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,280
(laughs maniacally)

178
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,120
(indistinct ominous whispering)

179
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
(creatures screeching)

180
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,680
Grendon's secure, sir.

181
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,680
You sure you want us
to just leave him here?

182
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
For now.

183
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,040
If he was exposed to that virus...

184
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,840
I don't trust the Gotham Police
to use the same precautions we have.

185
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Understood.

186
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,760
But I'll need one of you to stay back
and keep an eye on him.

187
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,040
(Kai Li) Tough luck, Sanjay.

188
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Damn it.

189
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Aye aye, Cap.

190
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,640
And why not?

191
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,280
After months at sea, what's a few
more days on this fine vessel?

192
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,080
It'll give me a chance to cozy up
with the nutso diseased corpse.

193
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,400
Hear that? Just you and me now, Mr. Zero.

194
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Lucius.

195
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
So good to see you.

196
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,000
You as well, son.

197
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,440
Nice work, Alfred.
You brought him home in one piece.

198
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,960
Not for his lack of trying, old friend.

199
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,120
How's business, Lucius?

200
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Copacetic.

201
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,000
So long as the board believes

202
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,720
all executive directives
are coming from you, that is.

203
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,080
For some reason,

204
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,920
they just don't seem quite comfortable
taking orders from me.

205
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,080
Well then,

206
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,560
I guess you'll just have to continue
making sure that all my directives are...

207
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Copacetic.

208
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,680
(laughs) I plan to.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,080
And you received my last consignment?

210
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,080
Like all your shipments over the years,

211
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,880
I had everything
situated in the wine cellar

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,760
to your precise specifications.

213
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,800
Thank you, Lucius.

214
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
One thing...

215
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Wine cellar?

216
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,320
Let's not romanticize it.

217
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
It's a cave.

218
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,200
(Kai Li) Whoa. Wow.

219
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Swanky.

220
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Master Bruce,

221
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,560
it appears word of your return
has spread, sir.

222
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,320
Oliver Queen has invited you
for dinner and drinks.

223
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,400
I shall assume
he intends an emphasis on the latter.

224
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Master Bruce?

225
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,520
Something isn't right.

226
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
(Kai Li yells)

227
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Claw marks?

228
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,720
It's some sort of animal attack.

229
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,280
- A bear, maybe?
- No.

230
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
The wounds are made bottom up.

231
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,640
Ursine claws are incapable
of that kind of movement.

232
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
This bruise...

233
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,560
- Strangulation.
- Means whatever did this had thumbs.

234
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,000
Obviously, he was killed elsewhere
and brought here.

235
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
But why?

236
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
I am...

237
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,240
Langstrom.

238
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,440
(gasps)

239
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Bruce, what is it?

240
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Did you...

241
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
Ah. Nevermind.

242
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,920
Should we notify the police?

243
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Yes.

244
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
But, not yet.

245
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
I'll handle it.

246
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
(Alfred) Are you sure
you're up for dinner, sir?

247
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,960
(Bruce) This house
has been sealed for 20 years

248
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,040
and the corpse downstairs
isn't doing the fustiness any favors.

249
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,880
At the very least,
we could stand the fresh air.

250
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,640
Besides, I haven't seen
Oliver since we ran into each other in...

251
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Dushanbe.

252
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,200
My name is Blood.

253
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,960
You do not want to know me or what I am.

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,120
Suffice it to say,

255
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,640
what is invisible to most
is visible to me.

256
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,480
Is that so?

257
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,400
June 26th, 1908.

258
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,240
You witnessed your parents' murder.

259
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,440
In the ensuing years,
you set upon the world,

260
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,120
absorbing all forms of criminology,
psychology, martial art...

261
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,560
Whatever skills you deemed necessary
to one day avenge your parents' deaths

262
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,400
and become this city's savior.

263
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
The Bat.

264
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,520
Do you have a point, Mr. Blood?

265
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,920
Your homecoming has set certain wheels
in motion, Bruce Wayne.

266
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
And though I know much,

267
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,840
I'm only allowed
to tell you these things three.

268
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,080
One.

269
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,360
You must seek out two spirits.

270
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
(laughs)

271
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Spirits?

272
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,120
One wrapped in bats, the other in flames.

273
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,520
Two.

274
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,840
To prevail in this, Bruce Wayne must die

275
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
and through death become himself.

276
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Three.

277
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,720
Before it can be saved,

278
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,920
Gotham...

279
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,080
must be burned to the ground.

280
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,880
Listen, I'm not sure what your game is,

281
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,480
but I'm not big on ghost stories.

282
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,320
Your dubiety will be your undoing.

283
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
(grunts)

284
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,000
You wanna talk undoing?

285
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,160
(Bruce groans)

286
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,200
You'll find no enemy here,
my thickheaded friend.

287
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,080
Rest assured when you face your foe,

288
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,360
you'll see me again.

289
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,640
I've readied the car for...

290
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
dinner.

291
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,360
And then Bruce says to the man,
'Sorry constable, it was dog fur.'

292
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
(laughing)

293
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
(laughs)

294
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
That's not quite how it went, Ollie.

295
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,160
Oh, come on, Brucey, you gotta embellish.

296
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,200
It's called showmanship. Right, Kelley?

297
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,680
It's Kai Li.

298
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Attagirl.

299
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,240
Oh. I hear you ran into one
of Gotham's finest down south.

300
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
Easy, fellas.

301
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Old Cobblepot was mad as a march hare
well before his expedition.

302
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,880
So, Mr. Queen,
I notice you're into hunting.

303
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,040
It's a passion that's taken me
around the world.

304
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,840
Not a matter of flora nor fauna alive,
that can best Oliver Queen.

305
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,600
You do know flora are plants, right?

306
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Of course.

307
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
And I stand by my assertion.

308
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,400
- For what plant could...
- (doorbell dings)

309
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
Oh, bully! My surprise guest.

310
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
One of Bruce and my oldest chums

311
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,800
and the man who will single-handedly
clean the fetid streets of our lost city,

312
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,920
I give you Gotham's future mayor,
Harvey Dent.

313
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,760
Let's not count chickens, Ollie.

314
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
Election's not for four days and...

315
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,600
I'll be...

316
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,000
Bruce Wayne.

317
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Look at you, kid.

318
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,720
Good to see you, Harvey.
It's been too long.

319
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,120
And look at us three. Together again.

320
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,760
So...

321
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,080
You gonna offer me a drink,

322
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
or not?

323
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,320
(telephone ringing)

324
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Wayne residence.

325
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,880
Mr. Wayne is out for the evening.

326
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,440
- Is there a message I could...
- (line disconnects)

327
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,520
So then, Harv,
I look this dewdropper square in his eyes.

328
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,640
And I say, 'Sorry constable,

329
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,360
it was duck fur.'

330
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,120
(laughing)

331
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,200
Tell me something, Harv.

332
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
Does the name 'Langstrom'
mean anything to you?

333
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
Professor Kirk Langstrom?

334
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,080
The Batman of crime alley?

335
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,200
He's loonier than Cobblepot.

336
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Come to think of it,

337
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,280
there has been an uptick
in crackpots lately,

338
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,080
which is saying something.

339
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,120
Gotham's always had more
than our fair share of wingnuts.

340
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,600
Langstrom is a biologist
at the university.

341
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,200
A chiropterologist, actually.

342
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,960
Of late,
he's rather infamously developed an

343
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,440
unhealthy obsession with the bats
he studies.

344
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,800
Unhealthy how?

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,240
He claims to be one.

346
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,080
Would you have an address for him?

347
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,800
Somewhere in Robin's Row.
I'll call the office.

348
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,320
Speaking of the office, gentlemen,

349
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,680
I have to report to it in six hours.

350
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,800
You'll have to show me how to do
that coin trick next time, Mr. Dent.

351
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Sorry, sport.

352
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,200
Magicians don't spill.

353
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,600
We'd best retire as well.

354
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
- Say, Ollie...
- Huh?

355
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Since Alfred's still airing out the house,

356
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,200
would you mind putting us up
for the night?

357
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,560
Mind? I'll ring for more sherry.

358
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Keep an eye on Oliver.

359
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm beginning to think
Sanjay drew the lucky straw.

360
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,040
(Grendon) First, I thought I failed.

361
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But I feel the power of his cold gift
inside me.

362
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
(grumbles)

363
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Shut your yap...

364
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Ow!

365
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,800
(sinister chuckling)

366
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,480
Just dummy up, would ya?

367
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
Everybody!

368
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,920
(singing) Ida

369
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,440
Sweet as apple cider

370
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,680
Sweeter than all I know

371
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
Come out

372
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,320
In the silvery moonlight...

373
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,120
Where's Bruce?

374
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,800
If he's smart, back in Antarctica.

375
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
Low, low, low, low, low

376
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Everybody!

377
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,720
(officer) Landlady said
it sounded like a murder.

378
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,160
I don't see no bodies.

379
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,880
You look for bodies, junior.

380
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,520
Screwballs like Langstrom,

381
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,880
always keep some dough squirreled away.

382
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
Hurry up and find it, will ya?
Before Gordon gets back...

383
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Jumped up jimminy!

384
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,400
Find what you were looking for?

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,360
Ventilate this son of a bitch.

386
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,120
(groaning)

387
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
(shuddering)

388
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,960
(groans)

389
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
Langstrom...

390
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,560
The hell were you into?

391
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,920
Okay, boys. Let's wrap the...

392
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
What the...

393
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,000
(telephone ringing)

394
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Wayne residence.

395
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,240
As I've stated thrice already,
Ms. Barbara,

396
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,080
Mr. Wayne is out for the evening.

397
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,600
- Now, I will certainly deliver...
- (line disconnects)

398
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,040
(Langstrom) 'If you're reading this,

399
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,240
I, Dr. Kirk Langstrom, am dead.

400
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Thankfully.

401
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,240
For a great doom is coming to this world.

402
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,240
Though you will think me mad,
believe me, if you can.

403
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,240
The bats speak to me.

404
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,400
They see beyond what man dare fathom.

405
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,920
And they tell me

406
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,640
of a growing horror.

407
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,120
A thing, crouching,
at the doorstep of our reality.

408
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,640
And it is hungry for us.

409
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,720
And it wants our world.

410
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,120
For centuries, acolytes of this evil,
the 'Cult of Ghul'

411
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,880
have endeavored to unlock the very door
that keeps the thing from our reality.

412
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,760
And now, their time

413
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,760
is nigh.

414
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,480
Yet, there is still a single hope.

415
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,600
They require a book,

416
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,720
The Testament of Ghul.

417
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,040
For only with the knowledge
contained in its pages

418
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,920
may they open that door.

419
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,200
The Testament must be kept from them,
at all costs.'

420
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,680
Testament.

421
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,640
'My Testament shall remain in Gotham.

422
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,320
Forever in my keep.'

423
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,560
Cobblepot had it.

424
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
(telephone ringing)

425
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,720
University repository.
Professor Manfurd speaking.

426
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,760
(man) Do you have keep
of Professor Cobblepot's records?

427
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,920
While he's on sabbatical, yes.
Who is this, please?

428
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,000
The Testament of Ghul...

429
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,120
I need it.

430
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Testament of...

431
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
No, I am not familiar with such a text.

432
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,440
Of course,
this is not a lending library, sir.

433
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,000
This is the university repository

434
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,521
- restricted to the public, if you...
- (line disconnects)

435
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,240
Cobblepot ordered me to destroy you.

436
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,840
Oh, but even if I could, I would not.

437
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,640
I, for one, am so very glad at that.

438
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,760
Talia? But how?

439
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,120
You know who I am.

440
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Good.

441
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,800
Please, don't kill me!

442
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,760
We'll leave that business to...

443
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Daitya.

444
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
No!

445
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
(groaning)

446
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
(gasps)

447
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,720
The Testament. Now!

448
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,440
(scoffs) No.

449
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,280
Do as you will, Daitya.

450
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
What the...

451
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
(roars)

452
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,040
(Batman groans)

453
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,840
(roaring)

454
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,160
Etrigan.

455
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,640
You were told you know not what you face.

456
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,000
Yet only you can stop it,
so leave this place.

457
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
(both grunting)

458
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,480
My sacrifice is made
so you might end this curse.

459
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,880
Alas, it'd be for naught
should the book remain hers!

460
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,560
(Batman) Let's try this again.

461
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,760
The book. Now.

462
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,680
Do not think your costume
can frighten me, Bat.

463
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,760
I am well acquainted with real matter
of demon, Djinn and devil.

464
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,160
Whatever the Cult of Ghul is planning,
it ends here.

465
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,160
The Cult of Ghul perished centuries ago.

466
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,560
I am its last...

467
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
For now.

468
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
(groans)

469
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,320
After leaving you that surprise
in your study,

470
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
I was certain, you'd realize

471
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
I was not one to be trifled with.

472
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
You knew I'd lead you to The Testament.

473
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,400
You killed Langstrom. (groans)

474
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,880
You have no clue
the power this book possesses.

475
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,680
I know those who seek it
mean to do this city harm.

476
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,680
Quite the contrary.

477
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,520
We mean to give this city purpose
and honor the damnation which bore it.

478
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,320
You, on the other hand,

479
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,200
we mean to do harm.

480
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,600
It can't be.

481
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
Another monster.

482
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,240
(grunting)

483
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,400
(roaring)

484
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,120
You don't go 812 years

485
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,280
without making your share
of interesting friends.

486
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,720
(groaning)

487
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,120
(Batman grunts)

488
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
(horn blows)

489
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,880
(Batman panting)

490
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,920
(groaning)

491
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,120
The bat still lives.

492
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,440
Mm. No matter.

493
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,360
He poses no serious threat to us.

494
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,200
Besides, you are needed
for another errand.

495
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,760
The key has been delivered to the harbor.

496
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Retrieve it.

497
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
(snoring)

498
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,800
To think, in our letters to each other,

499
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,840
I used to rib Bruce for collecting
a stray ragamuffin at every port.

500
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,040
But you two...

501
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,760
You two are on the level.

502
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,080
Of course, you can do no better
than Bruce Wayne.

503
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Bruce.

504
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,200
I owe the man.

505
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,200
(sobbing)

506
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Lord, I owe him
more than he could possibly know.

507
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,360
I'm so sorry, Brucey...

508
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,280
So sorry.

509
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,520
All right, easy there.

510
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm sure everything is fine, sir.

511
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,920
Mr. Wayne isn't one to hold a grudge
against a good man.

512
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,800
Come on, let's get some sleep.

513
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,680
Am I though? A good man?

514
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,680
Never forget,

515
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,520
the sins of the father
are heaped upon the son.

516
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,360
Thanks, Mr. Queen. Good to know.

517
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
(yawns)

518
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Alfred.

519
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Master Bruce.

520
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
What's happened?

521
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,880
Not sure. Yet.

522
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,760
(sniffs) Is that sulfur?

523
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,360
You're wounded. I have to clean...

524
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,400
Not yet. I have to analyze this substance.

525
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,200
For when I run into
the mutated creature again.

526
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,960
Mutated creature?

527
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,480
Wait, where are you off to?

528
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,080
The cave. We have work to do.

529
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,320
It's a wine cellar, Master Bruce.

530
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,000
We're not Neanderthals

531
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Boys...

532
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,680
It is still June, isn't it?

533
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
(horn blares)

534
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,160
Hold up, kid. Ship's off limits.

535
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Heya, boys.

536
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,800
Oliver Queen.

537
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,160
What are you doing here?

538
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,080
Expecting another dozen cases
of your bootleg hooch, are we?

539
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,680
And flout the prohibition laws

540
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,560
that help keep Gotham the fine
and chaste city we've all come to love?

541
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,960
Why, Jimmy Gordon, you slay me!

542
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Tell you what though,

543
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,120
if I do happen upon a case,
I'll let you watch me polish it off.

544
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,895
At least then, you and your boys can see

545
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,160
what getting to the bottom
of a case actually looks like.

546
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,960
Get off it, Queen! Now listen, son...

547
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
(engine starts)

548
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Go, go!

549
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,520
(shudders)

550
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Sanjay?

551
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Sanjay?

552
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,120
Jay? (gasps)

553
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
(sighs)

554
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,680
Sanjay...

555
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
(Grendon laughing)

556
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,800
(Oliver) I'd wise up if I were you, Jimmy.

557
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,280
The election's in three days.

558
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,200
If all goes pepper, my best chum,
Harvey Dent, will be your boss.

559
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,160
- Think about the future...
- (gunshots)

560
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
(screaming in distance)

561
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
(gasps)

562
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Mercy.

563
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,600
Come on. Let me through.

564
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
Chief wants us to keep you...

565
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,000
No!

566
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,000
- No! No, it's okay!
- No!

567
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,560
- No!
- It's okay.

568
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,000
(sobbing) No! No!

569
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,600
I've got you. I've got you. I know.

570
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,000
I know. I know, let it out.

571
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,880
It's okay, let it out.

572
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,760
What did this?

573
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,920
I don't know, Kai Li.

574
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,520
But by the Lord's hand...

575
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,880
they will pay.

576
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,600
Millennia ago,

577
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,800
you descended upon these wicked grounds
to learn secrets unholy.

578
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,520
Now, I shall use those very secrets
to give you life again.

579
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,920
Then, together, we will usher
Iog-Sotha into this reality!

580
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Daitya!

581
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,400
You come in good time.

582
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,920
Etrigan...

583
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Indeed.

584
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,200
I furnished a demon to take your place
in your bottle prison, Djinn.

585
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,600
Now, you must honor your end
of our bargain before returning to Hell.

586
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,840
Scorch this cursed ground
with your wretched hellfire.

587
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,040
(chanting incantation)

588
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,800
Come forth!

589
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,120
My daughter...

590
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
(laughs)

591
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
He has risen.

592
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,360
Ra's al Ghul has risen!

593
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,160
(Bruce) There are miles
of tunnel below this city.

594
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,320
Talia is down here somewhere.

595
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,120
The book you requested, sir.

596
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,160
I would certainly never count myself
among the 'believers', Master Bruce.

597
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,520
But I have seen enough in my time
to at least be wary of the dark arts.

598
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,400
I appreciate the concern,
but we don't have time for superstitions.

599
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
I only mean,

600
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,680
perhaps it would be wise
to not discount such things out of hand.

601
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,760
I'll admit a lot of what I've seen
seems to defy logic.

602
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,080
But I assure you

603
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,640
there's a rational explanation
behind all of it.

604
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
What's this?

605
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,480
(Alfred) 'The mausoleum of the serpent?'

606
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,880
'Before humans, there were serpents.

607
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,560
Masters of an ancient black magic.

608
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,480
In what would be 2000 BC,
a dark priest, Ra's al Ghul,

609
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,040
uncovered the ruins
of their unholy grounds.

610
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,640
Using necromantic arts,
he wrested their secrets from them...

611
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,960
The nature of the cosmos was his to wield.

612
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,160
Yet, Ra's' one true desire
was to serve his master...

613
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,520
Iog-Sotha.

614
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,360
And to bring his dark
outer God into our reality.'

615
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,280
Outer gods?

616
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,040
All myth, Alfred.

617
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,920
Then of what use is this to us?

618
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,200
(Bruce) If you look
at any myth hard enough,

619
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,200
you'll find the remnants
of fact underneath.

620
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Aklo.

621
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,520
I'm sorry, sir...

622
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,120
Aklo?

623
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,560
The tick marks in that etching.

624
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
It's an ancient system of writing...

625
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Aklo.

626
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
They're not ticks.

627
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
They're coordinates.

628
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Facts.

629
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
Is it possible?

630
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,520
This mausoleum is located
somewhere beneath Gotham?

631
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,760
I'm going to find out.

632
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,160
Check to see if our compound is ready.

633
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,080
For a million, million years,
Iog-Sotha has longed for this planet.

634
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,760
He howls and scrapes
at a door he can never open.

635
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,400
Now, we shall descend
into the unholy chamber of the serpents

636
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,400
and invoke the ceremony
that will show us this door.

637
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,560
(Talia) You can't open a door
without a key.

638
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
(telephone ringing)

639
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,200
Oh, heavens, not again.

640
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Wayne residence and I assure you,
Mr. Wayne is still...

641
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,560
Oh. Chief Gordon. My apologies, sir.

642
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
I thought it was your...

643
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,680
I thought it was a wrong number.

644
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
My Lord...

645
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,320
Yes, of course.

646
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,600
If Mr. Queen could look after Kai Li
for the time being,

647
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,400
it would be most appreciated.

648
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,640
And the moment he returns, I...

649
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,000
I shall inform Mr. Wayne.

650
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,520
(Ra's al Ghul) O thou Gog,

651
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,560
O thou Gog,

652
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,840
O Kore... O Persephone...

653
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,600
O Amaga, Iog-Sotha,

654
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,480
Darkness out of time,

655
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,600
show us your door

656
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,400
so that we may partake

657
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,600
in this holy purpose and finally...

658
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,720
What manner of insolent worm is this?

659
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,960
Continue the incantation, Father.

660
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,600
We will deal with the interloper.

661
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
(growling)

662
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,960
(groaning, roaring)

663
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,520
(Talia) You destroyed him.

664
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,960
What magic is this?

665
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,640
Not magic.

666
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,960
Chlorine concentrate.

667
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
Very well.

668
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,400
My, you are a quick study.

669
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,480
I suppose
I'll have to dispose of you intimately.

670
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,320
- (grunts)
- (groans)

671
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,240
(Ra's resumes chanting)

672
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
(grunts)

673
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,800
Etrigan...

674
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
(Talia groans)

675
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,960
That's enough, Ra's.

676
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,680
Whoever you really are
and whatever your game is,

677
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
it's over.

678
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
(chuckling)

679
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,720
Indeed,

680
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,480
it is over...

681
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,040
(rumbling)

682
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,600
Over for you.

683
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,240
(Talia) The ritual is complete.

684
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,520
(hissing)

685
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,240
(Ra's al Ghul) Reptiles once
ruled this earth.

686
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,400
And now, they return with a plague
that will lead us to the door.

687
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,120
To Iog-Sotha!

688
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
(Ra's al Ghul laughing)

689
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,720
(Batman screams)

690
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,240
- (hissing)
- (people screaming)

691
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,520
Extra, extra! Gotham knee-deep in lizards!

692
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
(siren blaring)

693
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,920
(people clapping)

694
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,400
(Harvey) Thank you. Thank you.

695
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,920
When elected, this infestation
will be my first priority.

696
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,400
I refuse to let this be another scar
on the face of our proud, beautiful city.

697
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,480
(man) Yes, Harvey!

698
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,200
- I say enough!
- (people cheering)

699
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,000
(Batman exhales)

700
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
(groans)

701
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,360
(people screaming)

702
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
(grunts)

703
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
(panting)

704
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,040
(gasping)

705
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,160
(distorted voice) The thing is coming.

706
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,640
Today we will only show you...

707
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,240
Show you the shape of the thing.

708
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,240
For to gaze upon it

709
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,640
is to invite madness!

710
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,440
And though your mind may force itself
to forget what it sees,

711
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,360
the mark of madness it leaves behind

712
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,680
is yours for eternity.

713
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,680
The only thing that can stop it
is the Bat.

714
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,920
The only thing that can stop it...

715
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,600
(screaming)

716
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,240
is you!

717
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,200
(Batman) I... remember.

718
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,000
(bell tolling)

719
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,560
Father?

720
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,600
(newsreader)
And this just in, it's official,

721
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,440
Harvey Dent is our next mayor!

722
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,320
And in light of the sudden and miraculous
disappearance of the still-inexplicable

723
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,040
reptile infestation, one has to believe
that his victory is a sign

724
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,920
that Harvey Dent is, indeed,
our city's gateway to hope.

725
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,415
(Harvey) We've endured so much together.

726
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,560
As Mayor, I promise
this will be a shining new era for Gotham.

727
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,200
Iog-Sotha has spoken.

728
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,280
Dent is the door.

729
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,600
Then all that remains
is to retrieve the key.

730
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,480
- Masters, I told you. I know of no key.
- (Ra's al Ghul) Imbecile.

731
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,200
You found Yib Nogeroth,
son of Iog-Sotha, in the ice.

732
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,200
Though he sleeps,
he carried out his father's will...

733
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,120
and planted his seed in you.

734
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,080
Of course, the gift within me.

735
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,840
This is the key!

736
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,840
Tell me, how may I give... (screams)

737
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,520
(groaning)

738
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,520
Iog-Sotha,

739
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,000
make this gift a new vessel.

740
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,920
The agent of your delivery.

741
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,640
Dent.

742
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,960
(Batman) Doom...

743
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,600
Doom...

744
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,320
The great doom is coming.
It's at the doorstep.

745
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,040
He hasn't moved from this spot,

746
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,680
nor so much as spoken to me
since I found him.

747
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,400
Not even after you told him
about misters Tawde and Grayson?

748
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,920
Particularly after, I'm afraid.

749
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Alfred,

750
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,200
it's time to call Hugo.

751
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,000
The staff at Arkham can help.

752
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,080
(locks clicking)

753
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,080
Congrats, Mr. Mayor!

754
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,760
Thanks, Pete. But I only just got the job.

755
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,120
Now, time to see if I can deliver.

756
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,520
(woman) I'm sure you will.

757
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,800
The people have every faith in you.

758
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,120
(chuckles) Thank you, ma'am.

759
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,200
I won't let you down.

760
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,200
(gasps)

761
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,040
(Oliver) You know, kiddo, I had three
locks put on that door for a reason.

762
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,200
Sorry, I guess curiosity.

763
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,120
What the...

764
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,080
Mr. Queen?

765
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,600
What is all this?

766
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,520
Very soon,
a great evil will befall Gotham.

767
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,520
It's up to me to defeat it.

768
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,240
Uh-huh.

769
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,520
I see.

770
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,520
And, uh, how's that?

771
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,240
Have you forgotten?

772
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,480
'The sins of the Father
are heaped upon the son.'

773
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,480
No man is guilty
of more sin than my father.

774
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,400
As impossible as it seems,
Henry Queen was over 300 years old.

775
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,760
As it goes,
the cur made a pact with the devil.

776
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,920
Over time it drove him mad.

777
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
By the end,

778
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,640
there was no vile deed
the wretched bastard would refuse.

779
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,680
Including the cold-blooded murder

780
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,080
of Thomas and Martha Wayne.

781
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,400
He told me of this unholy act
perpetrated centuries ago.

782
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,960
An act so wicked, so foul,
it stirred this thing

783
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,000
that would one day destroy Gotham.

784
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,960
So, in turn, I vowed to undo
each of those sins.

785
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,920
I set about preparing to face
this impending doom he warned of.

786
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,440
Testing myself against deadly beasts.

787
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,920
Collecting all manner of holy weapons.

788
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,000
Like these four arrows.

789
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,920
Stained with the very blood
of St. Sebastian himself.

790
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,760
Uh, listen, Mr. Queen, sir...

791
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
You should go.

792
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,520
This thing knows who I am.

793
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,960
Surely, it will come for me.

794
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,280
Though I've enjoyed your company,

795
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,720
it's best you not be here when it does.

796
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,240
(door opens, closes)

797
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
The door...

798
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,040
The doorway to our reality. Where?

799
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,560
(ominous voice)
How is it you do not yet realize?

800
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,600
Though you once feared them,

801
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,280
only the bats know the way to salvation.

802
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,800
You must accept as I have.

803
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,040
Only they will tell...

804
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Damn it!

805
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,880
We're running out of time!

806
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,040
Why don't you tell me what the bats say!

807
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,040
You said they speak to you, right?

808
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,600
They surround you.

809
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,880
You...

810
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,080
The spirit wrapped in bats.

811
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,640
Mr. Wayne.

812
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,840
It's Oliver. I think he's...

813
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,120
Lost his mind.

814
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,480
Alfred told me to leave you alone,
because you weren't well. But...

815
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,320
Golly, did he hold out cheap.

816
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,720
Listen, sir. I don't understand
what's going on,

817
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,600
but I can tell it's bad.

818
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,160
Real bad.

819
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,840
And whatever it is...

820
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,600
Dick and Sanjay...

821
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,000
Now, something's wrong with Oliver.

822
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,320
He's dressed as a knight and going on
and on about a 'doom' that is coming.

823
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,920
(Dr. West) Poison ivy, Mayor Dent.

824
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,760
(Harvey) Oh. Come now.

825
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,040
I haven't been out of the city in months,
Dr. West.

826
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,440
Well, then, it's stress.

827
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,920
You have had a demanding week, Harv.

828
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,160
Now, find some time to relax. And...

829
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,280
For Pete's sake, man! Don't scratch it!

830
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,560
It'll just get infected.

831
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,320
Here.

832
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Use this.

833
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,280
(Oliver) Lord, grant me the strength
to destroy the thing that is coming.

834
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,760
(footsteps approaching)

835
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,400
Oh. Hello.

836
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,520
Why, we were just talking about you.

837
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
(screeching)

838
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,080
(laughs) Thank goodness!

839
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,080
If I'd killed you that easily,
there'd have been no sport.

840
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
(grunts)

841
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,920
(yelling)

842
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,760
(groans)

843
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,120
(screeches)

844
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,040
(Oliver coughing)

845
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
(groans)

846
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,200
Bruce?

847
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
Nice outfit.

848
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
You, too.

849
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
(Oliver) Showmanship.

850
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,760
(groans)

851
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,080
You look awful.

852
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,480
(groans loudly)

853
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Easy, kid.

854
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,520
At this point,

855
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,840
they're all that's holding me together.

856
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,320
But good news...

857
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,960
And without using
any of St. Sebastian's arrows.

858
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,680
Told you no fauna could best me.

859
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,600
(chuckles weakly)

860
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,560
Kai Li.

861
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,320
Give us a minute.

862
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,800
I thought I could stop it, Bruce.

863
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,120
This thing...

864
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,840
Thought I was ready,
but nothing could prepare...

865
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,320
I know, Oliver. More than you realize.

866
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,880
Bruce...

867
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,280
Something I must confess...

868
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,280
It's weighed on me for years.

869
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,920
Old friend, my father...

870
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,520
(sighs)

871
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,800
I'm so sorry, Bruce, my father, he...

872
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,280
Did what he did.

873
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,800
You did nothing but live as a good man.

874
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,360
That's all that matters.

875
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,160
I hope you're right, Brucey...

876
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,120
For both our sake.

877
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,600
The bloodline can never escape the stain.

878
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,720
The sins of the father.

879
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,080
(wind whistles)

880
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,800
Whoever you are, please,

881
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,400
kill me.

882
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,080
(Talia) Do not despair.

883
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,160
The end is near.

884
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,080
But you have a little more to do.

885
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,280
(cawing)

886
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,200
It's not your fault, Mr. Wayne.

887
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,800
Talking dead folks, reptile plagues,
plant monsters, it's not...

888
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,960
natural.

889
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,120
No one could have seen this coming.

890
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,600
I should have.

891
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,800
The signs were there.

892
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,040
I refused to heed them,

893
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,320
because they didn't align
with what I deemed to be rational.

894
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,360
- This thing, it is coming, huh?
- Soon.

895
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,200
And I don't know how.

896
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,000
But only I can stop it.

897
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,800
With all due respect, sir,
Oliver said the same thing.

898
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,400
And now he's dead.

899
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,360
He died trying to do what was right.

900
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,120
He died because he thought he owed
the world for whatever insanity his dad...

901
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,960
- Oliver believed the sins of the father...
- Are heaped upon the son.

902
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,840
Yeah. I know that verse.

903
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,080
But don't forget Ezekiel 18,

904
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,935
'The son will not share
the guilt of the father,

905
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,840
nor will the father share
the guilt of the son.'

906
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,720
My point is, you don't have to do this.

907
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,320
You can leave. We can leave.

908
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,640
Get a new ship and go anywhere else.

909
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,400
You don't owe this city anything.

910
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,440
Most people, if they see a house on fire,

911
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,760
would run and call for help
once they're out of harm's way.

912
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,000
While others, very few others,

913
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,920
would run right into that house

914
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,120
and try to save those
who are trapped inside.

915
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,240
The moment I found you,

916
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,880
my every instinct told me
which one of those two people you were.

917
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,360
Doom or not, Kai Li,

918
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,160
Gotham is a city on fire.

919
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,720
It needs those who are willing
to run into the inferno.

920
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,480
Bruce Wayne, there you are.

921
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,960
Was there something you wanted, Jim?

922
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,800
Uh, no.

923
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,720
Yes, actually.

924
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,360
First, deeply sorry about your boys.
My condolences.

925
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,720
I assure you my best men are on the...

926
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,480
I'm here on behalf of my daughter.

927
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,640
Barbara?

928
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,440
She said she's been trying to reach you.

929
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,240
I'm sure you've heard about her...

930
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,480
Accident a few years back? Yes.

931
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,960
Poor thing. She hasn't been the same.

932
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,640
Wait a minute. Barbara?

933
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,880
Barbara Gordon? The Oracle, right?

934
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,640
I read about her in Spiritualism Monthly!

935
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,040
Yes, I suppose Barbara has
developed something of a...

936
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,760
reputation in certain circles.

937
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,800
And she says she needs to speak to me?

938
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,040
Not her, exactly.

939
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,080
- One of her...
- Ghosts.

940
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,160
She said you'd know who.

941
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,360
Do you?

942
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,880
I don't.

943
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,520
Bruce, I realize it's an unusual request.
But it seemed...

944
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,480
so very urgent to my Barbara,
and it would...

945
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,520
- It would mean a lot to me.
- Tell her I'll see her tonight.

946
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,440
- Okay. But visiting hours are...
- Tonight!

947
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,680
Do you think the Oracle will know
how to stop this thing?

948
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,920
Not the Oracle,

949
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,720
but the spirit wrapped in flames.

950
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,040
It's time.

951
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,640
I can't let you leave.

952
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,320
(Bruce) That's not your decision.

953
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,080
You're not well. What's happening to you?

954
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,800
What needs to happen.

955
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,240
I can't pretend to know
exactly what I'm about to face.

956
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,560
But I do know that I must face it.

957
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,560
This is what I was meant to do.

958
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,080
- Bruce...
- Please, Alfred.

959
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,040
I haven't much time.

960
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,080
Very well then, Master Bruce.

961
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,560
If time is of the essence, as you say...

962
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,680
May I suggest taking the car?

963
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,640
You're in charge of the wine cellar now.

964
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,560
You're not coming back?

965
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,280
Goodbye...

966
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,480
Son.

967
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,840
Goodbye, Alfred.

968
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,520
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

969
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,840
Although, I suppose, it should concern me

970
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,320
you're able to break into this place
so easily.

971
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,240
(Batman) No offense,

972
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,240
but I'd say the greater concern
would be Arkham's ability

973
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,040
to keep those from breaking out.

974
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,800
Oh, it's not so bad in here, Bruce.

975
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,320
Three squares. Good company.

976
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,240
A complete absence of unnecessary pity
from loved ones.

977
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,640
Besides, if you saw as I do,

978
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,840
you'd take the insanity within these walls
over the true madness out there.

979
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,160
Perhaps you're right.

980
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,920
So, a bat? Huh.

981
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,800
Interesting creatures, aren't they?

982
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:03,080
Funny how one little winged rodent
can mean so many different things

983
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,040
to so many different people.

984
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,000
If you ask me,

985
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,120
it's all about their uncanny ability
to maneuver in the dark.

986
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,400
Like they embody a perception
of the things that can't be seen.

987
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,040
So, let me ask you.

988
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,200
What do they mean to you, Bruce?

989
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,800
Why a bat?

990
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:25,720
Bats inspire fear,
and criminals are superstitious and...

991
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,400
Cowardly lot, sure.

992
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,600
I figured that's what you'd say.

993
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,640
But is that really why?

994
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,880
Well, something to think about, I guess.

995
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,160
Okay then, down to business
and the reason you've come.

996
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,320
Do you know with whom you need to speak?

997
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,840
I wish to speak to the spirit
wrapped in flames.

998
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,880
But you don't know who this spirit is?

999
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,760
Only that it burns in hell.

1000
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,400
And you're sure you want to do this?

1001
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,280
It's not a question of want, Barbara.

1002
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,360
Spirit we seek, I surrender myself.

1003
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,720
Body and soul, come to us now.

1004
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,040
Come to us now.

1005
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,600
Come to us now!

1006
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,240
Father?

1007
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,360
It can't be.

1008
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,520
Hello, Bruce.

1009
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
What is this?

1010
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,440
It's me, son.

1011
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,560
And I am so, so sorry.

1012
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,240
Believe me, I wanted to tell you this
when you were old enough.

1013
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,520
But not like this.

1014
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,120
Not here.

1015
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,720
Tell me what?

1016
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,400
I, Thomas Wayne, was born in 1585

1017
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,000
and was among the first colonists
to venture to the new world.

1018
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,720
I and others founded the settlement
that would one day become Gotham.

1019
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,680
Lo, but those first years
were unforgiving.

1020
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,120
The land penurious.
The winters, harsh, indeed.

1021
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,720
We were dying.

1022
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:14,480
Until, one among us, Oswald Cobblepot
discovered what was buried

1023
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,280
under the earth beneath our land.

1024
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,040
Myself, Bartly Langstrom, and Henry Queen

1025
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,120
followed Cobblepot into an ungodly place.

1026
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,520
He showed us the ancient book
he'd found there.

1027
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,400
A book steeped in malevolence.

1028
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:40,000
Call it despair, call it desperation,
call it, perhaps, even greed,

1029
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,040
but we four read from this book

1030
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,120
- and performed its ceremonies most vile.
- (horse neighing)

1031
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,680
Shame of which would last eons.

1032
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,280
But, alas, our settlement had been saved.

1033
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,560
Flourished, even.

1034
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,760
And not only did the four of us
prosper beyond our wildest dreams,

1035
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,080
we'd been gifted apparent life eternal.

1036
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,520
In time, it was nearly as if
we'd forgotten the events

1037
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,560
of that despicable night ever occurred.

1038
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,040
It, however, did not forget us.

1039
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,960
For centuries later,

1040
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:21,320
we would learn that the malevolence
we bore that fateful night awoke him.

1041
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,760
Iog Sotha.

1042
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,440
It was our wretchedness

1043
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,640
that drew the thing
to the threshold of our reality.

1044
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,600
You...

1045
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,560
called him forth.

1046
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,160
Knowing what we'd done, truly done,

1047
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,160
drove Bartly Langstrom to suicide,

1048
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,600
Oswald Cobblepot to the ends of the earth,

1049
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,320
and Henry Queen to...

1050
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,840
(yelling)

1051
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:51,400
Well, worst yet, the curse lays the burden
of undoing our misdeeds

1052
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,080
upon our children.

1053
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,120
The sins of the father
are heaped upon the son.

1054
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,440
Yes.

1055
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,400
That's why Kirk Langstrom
and Oliver both...

1056
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,920
But it's not too late, son.

1057
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,400
You can stop this thing.

1058
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,920
Iog Sotha has not yet entered our realm.

1059
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,000
You must find the door
before it fully opens.

1060
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,240
How?

1061
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,520
By becoming what you truly are.

1062
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,360
In coming to see me,

1063
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:22,440
you've accepted a world
beyond reason and science.

1064
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,480
But you must embrace it.

1065
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,160
You must seek communion...

1066
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,200
With them.

1067
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,560
The bats.

1068
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,360
Thank you, Barbara.

1069
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,880
Thank you.

1070
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,280
(Batman chanting incantation)

1071
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,240
(ominous voice) You have returned.

1072
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,360
It is time for Iog-Sotha.

1073
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,680
Only the bat can face him.

1074
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,800
You understand what that means now, yes?

1075
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,440
I do. At last.

1076
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,040
Y ou are prepared for this sacrifice?

1077
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,600
I am.

1078
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,920
Then now, you are one of us.

1079
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,920
Just tell me where to find the thing.

1080
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,360
Where it began.

1081
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,800
(coin clinking)

1082
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,880
Harvey...

1083
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,480
Poison Ivy, I'm told.

1084
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,000
Considering a second opinion.

1085
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,800
Bruce?

1086
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,680
You take care of yourself.

1087
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,120
Huh?

1088
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,360
You too, Harv.

1089
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,520
I'll see you soon.

1090
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,960
(grunting)

1091
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,720
(grunts)

1092
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,080
(roars)

1093
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,920
Forgive me, boys.

1094
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,320
(yelling)

1095
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,360
(growls)

1096
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,480
(grunts)

1097
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,040
Thank God.

1098
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,600
Kick their ass, Bruce.

1099
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,080
(Ra's al Ghul chanting incantation)

1100
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,680
Iog Sotha,

1101
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,400
I feel your power.

1102
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,080
Yes!

1103
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
(Talia yells)

1104
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,360
(groans)

1105
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
(both grunting)

1106
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,800
I'd rather like to think
that under different circumstances,

1107
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,360
we'd be allies...

1108
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,320
Friends, perhaps.

1109
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,680
(choking)

1110
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,240
(screams)

1111
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,200
(Talia groans weakly)

1112
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,440
My friends have a bad habit of dying.

1113
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,400
It's just you and me now.

1114
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,920
(groans)

1115
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,240
You fool.

1116
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,720
This thing...

1117
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,280
This thing
is beyond your human comprehension.

1118
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,680
Behold.

1119
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:42,640
For even to gaze upon it
is to incur madness!

1120
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,680
I've seen it.

1121
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,840
Do you not see?

1122
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,560
The deed is done.

1123
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,640
I am him.

1124
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,120
Born of the nameless mist,

1125
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,440
progenitor of Yib Nogeroth,

1126
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,800
Hastur the unspeakable...

1127
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,560
And Cthulhu himself!

1128
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,240
(grunts)

1129
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,000
Die!

1130
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:43,360
For soon all that lives shall
follow thee into Hell!

1131
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,440
(screaming)

1132
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,120
Humanity shall be wiped from the earth!

1133
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,160
(woman) What is that?

1134
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,800
(screaming)

1135
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,120
(Blood) To prevail in this,

1136
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,240
Bruce Wayne must die
and through death become himself.

1137
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,480
(Oliver) The bloodline can never escape
the stain of sin...

1138
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,080
(Barbara) Why a bat?

1139
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,280
(ominous voice)
The bats know the way to salvation.

1140
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,720
(Thomas) You must embrace it.

1141
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,800
(ominous voice) Now!
You are now one of us.

1142
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,120
You're still alive?

1143
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,360
(roaring)

1144
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,080
Not alive.

1145
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,200
Not anymore.

1146
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,600
What are you?

1147
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,280
I am Batman!

1148
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,600
(screaming)

1149
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,280
Yes!

1150
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,040
(snarls)

1151
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,880
(high-pitched droning)

1152
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,960
(groaning)

1153
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,440
(screaming)

1154
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,840
Etrigan...

1155
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:12,960
(grunting)

1156
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,520
Well done. The ledger is clear.

1157
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,560
Now take your leave,
whilst I do my damage here.

1158
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,720
(Blood) You must seek out two spirits.

1159
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,920
One wrapped in bats, the other in flames.

1160
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,720
A price is to be paid for your dark reign

1161
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,240
and so here for eternity
in this hell you remain!

1162
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,320
(Blood) Bruce Wayne must die,

1163
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,920
and through death, become himself.

1164
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,240
Before it can be truly saved,

1165
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,520
Gotham must be burned to the ground.

1166
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,360
(people screaming)

1167
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,360
(panting)

1168
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,640
(Lucius) Though this disaster
struck only months ago,

1169
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,600
the Bruce Wayne memorial foundation
has already begun to rebuild.

1170
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,800
A better Gotham is in reach.

1171
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:21,000
And we'd like to dedicate this effort
to two dear friends of Mr. Wayne,

1172
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,480
and of Gotham itself.

1173
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,360
The honorable Harvey Dent
and Mr. Oliver Queen.

1174
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,520
(people clapping)

1175
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,400
And now,

1176
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,560
the acting head of the foundation,

1177
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,560
Ms. Kai Li Cain.

1178
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,920
I've not been here long,

1179
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:55,040
but thanks to Bruce, I've come
to think of Gotham as home.

1180
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,880
In many ways, my first home.

1181
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,800
Bruce Wayne had a vision of
what Gotham could be.

1182
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,480
An ideal.

1183
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,400
I promise to do
everything within my power,

1184
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,640
and beyond my power,

1185
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:12,000
to bring about the realization
of Bruce Wayne's dream

1186
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,480
for a new Gotham City.

1187
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,760
Speaking of Bruce,

1188
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,480
for those of you who knew and loved him,

1189
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,400
take comfort in this final thought.

1190
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,400
He wasn't always the most forthcoming man,

1191
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,600
but you could
always be sure of two things.

1192
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,000
He would do anything
for those that he loved,

1193
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,280
and he was stubborn as hell.

1194
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,120
I know Bruce is watching over us.

1195
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,480
And something tells me that if we,

1196
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,360
the people and city that he held so dear,
ever needed him,

1197
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,760
really needed him,

1198
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,560
not even death itself could keep him away.
