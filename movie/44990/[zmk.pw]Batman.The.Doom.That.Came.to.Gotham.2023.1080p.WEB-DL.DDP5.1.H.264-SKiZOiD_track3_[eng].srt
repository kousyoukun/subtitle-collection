1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,560
(广播中的李凯)圣贝，收到吗？
(Kai Li over radio) Saint Bay, do you copy?

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
进来吧，圣贝。
Come in, Saint Bay.

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,560
阿尔戈到圣贝站。
Argo to Saint Bay station.

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
阿尔戈到圣贝站。进来吧，圣贝。
Argo to Saint Bay station. Come in, Saint Bay.

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,735
(广播中的男子)这里是圣贝站。请回答，阿尔戈。
(man over radio) This is Saint Bay station. Come in, Argo.

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,760
这是韦恩探险队的凯·李·凯恩。
This is Kai Li Cain from the Wayne expedition.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,560
我们找到了科布尔波特大本营。
We've found the Cobblepot base camp...

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,480
或者它的残留物。
or what's left of it.

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,200
韦恩先生和格雷森、陶德正在寻找幸存者。
Mr. Wayne is with Grayson and Tawde looking for survivors.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,040
迪克，桑杰，报告。
Dick, Sanjay, report.

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
情况很糟，先生。除了身体什么都没有。
It's bad, sir. Nothing but dead bodies.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,040
嗯。成堆的。
Yeah. Heaps of 'em.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,840
我们找到了船上的舱单，长官。
We found the ship's manifest, sir.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
我们还差两个人。一个叫格兰登的人
We're still two short. Someone named Grendon,

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,320
然后是科布尔波特本人。
and then Cobblepot himself.

16
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,600
别发脾气，韦恩先生，
Not to go grummy, Mr. Wayne,

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,960
但任何人在这里生存的几率...
but the odds of anyone surviving out here...

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
我们一直在找。
We keep looking.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,160
Cobblepot教授的日记？
Professor Cobblepot's journal?

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
(Cobblepot)‘探险第三天。
(Cobblepot) 'Expedition day three.

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
男人们都很紧张。
Men are on edge.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,720
狗仍然不会离开船。
The dogs will still not leave the ship.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
就是这个地方。
It's this place.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
他们害怕它。
They fear it.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,800
我必须承认..。
And I must confess...

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,960
我不怪他们。
I don't blame them.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
第七天..。
Day seven...

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
情况更糟了。
Things are worse.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,880
无法让狗平静下来。
Could not calm the dogs.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,760
被迫将他们全部杀光。
Forced to kill them all.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,640
格兰登不见了。
Grendon has disappeared.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
恐怕已经疯了。
Has gone mad, I fear.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
而其他人，他们不会说话。
And the others, they won't speak.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
他们甚至拒绝搬家。
They refuse to even move.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,680
第十天，现在就我一个人。
Day ten, just me now.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,080
当我闭上眼睛..。
When I close my eyes...

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,480
我听到它在呼唤。
I hear it calling.

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
从冰面上。‘
From the ice.'

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
(布鲁斯)科布尔波特？
(Bruce) Cobblepot?

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,280
(Cobblepot)“它告诉我它来了。”
(Cobblepot) 'It tells me it's coming.'

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
(布鲁斯)Cobblepot教授！奥斯瓦尔德！
(Bruce) Professor Cobblepot! Oswald!

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
(尖叫声)
(screams)

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
(呻吟)
(groaning)

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,240
(Cobblepot)‘它告诉我...
(Cobblepot) 'It tells me...

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,280
我已经回家了。
I have come home.'

46
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,000
(冰块咔嗒作响)
(ice clacking)

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,960
(刮冰)
(ice scraping)

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
科布尔波特？
Cobblepot?

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,920
(男人)科布尔波特不再是了。
(man) Cobblepot is no more.

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
他现在是另一回事了。
He's something else now.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
他已经变成了他一直想要成为的人。
He's become what he was always meant to be.

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,240
我想你就是格兰登吧。
I take it you're Grendon.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
(格兰登)就是格兰登。就一次。
(Grendon) Was Grendon. Once.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,200
现在我被他选中了
Now I'm chosen by him

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,520
成为他向世界传递信息的使者。
to be his messenger to the world.

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,400
我明白了。“他”到底是谁？
I see. And who is 'him', exactly?

57
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,280
他是那个永远在时空之外徘徊和奴役的人，
Him is he who bays and slavers forever outside time and space,

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,880
从星星上蹒跚而下的人
who shambled down out of the stars

59
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,720
当地球在海洋中产生新的可憎之物，并在陆地上枯萎时。
when Earth new and spawned abominations in the seas and blights upon the land.

60
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,120
当人再来的时候，他会有祸的。
Woe to man when he comes again.

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
(布鲁斯尖叫)
(Bruce screams)

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,560
(格兰登)凝视他的形体，就是招致疯狂。
(Grendon) To gaze upon his form is to invite madness.

63
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,640
这就是为什么，为了服侍他，我选择了...
That is why, in order to serve him, I chose to make...

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,960
调整。
adjustments.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
你得跟我一起走。
You're gonna come with me.

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
现在!
Now!

67
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
不是的。不是的！
No. No!

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,520
-我还没说完呢.-(生物在头顶尖叫)
- I'm not finished yet. - (creature screeching overhead)

69
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,120
(咕哝着)
(grunting)

70
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,520
(气喘吁吁)
(gasping)

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
(咕哝着)
(grunting)

72
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,360
(呼吸颤抖)
(breath trembles)

73
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,200
(呻吟)
(groaning)

74
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,720
-(生物尖叫)-(咕噜声)
- (creature screeching) - (grunting)

75
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,240
(格兰登大喊大叫)
(Grendon yelling)

76
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
(格兰登叹息)
(Grendon groans)

77
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
听着。
Hark...

78
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,400
潜伏者就在门槛上。
The lurker is on the threshold.

79
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
你看..。
And behold...

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
它.。
It...

81
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
是.。
Is...

82
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
要来了。
Coming.

83
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,840
(播放爵士乐)
(jazz music playing)

84
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,160
(布鲁斯在广播中)去阿尔戈的海滩派对。
(Bruce over radio) Shore party to Argo.

85
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
这是阿尔戈。您先请。
This is Argo. Go ahead.

86
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,680
李凯，准备好炸药。
Kai Li, ready the explosives.

87
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,840
呃，你是说炸药吗？
Uh, did you say explosives?

88
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
我是说，当然可以，韦恩先生。多少?
I mean, sure, Mr. Wayne. How many?

89
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
他们所有人。
All of them.

90
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,120
喔！热狗!
Whoo! Hot dog!

91
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,160
任何东西都不能再进出那个洞穴了。
Nothing'll get into or out of that cave ever again.

92
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,680
你确定封锁它是明智之举？
You sure sealing it off was wise?

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,375
像你描述的那种史前生物的科学价值...
The scientific value of a prehistoric creature like the one you described...

94
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,320
远远小于它所构成的危险。
Is far less than the danger it posed.

95
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,760
那东西已经感染了这里周围的野生动物
That thing has infected the surrounding wildlife here

96
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
使用了某种诱变剂。
with some sort of mutational agent.

97
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,840
一种一定潜伏了几千年的病毒。
A virus that must've lain dormant for millennia.

98
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
而且很有可能，
And it's quite possible,

99
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,920
它也感染了科布尔波特派对的一些人。
it infected some of the Cobblepot party as well.

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
(倒吸一口气)
(gasps)

101
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,240
所以，不管那个生物是什么，迪克，
So, whatever that creature was, Dick,

102
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
它本该一直埋在地下的。
it was meant to stay buried.

103
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,720
先生，那Cobblepot呢？
Sir, what about Cobblepot?

104
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
你找到他了吗？
Did you ever find him?

105
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
(布鲁斯)科布尔波特走了。
(Bruce) Cobblepot's gone.

106
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,080
(咕哝着)
(grunting)

107
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,040
天哪，那是什么难闻的气味？
Heavens, what is that ghastly smell?

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,960
那就是你的朋友格兰登。
That would be your friend, Grendon.

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,280
一旦我们让他暖和起来，他就开始宠坏了。
Once we warmed him up, he started to spoil.

110
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
宠坏了？
Spoil?

111
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
老帕鲁卡已经死得像头驴了。
The old palooka's dead as a donkey.

112
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
对吧，迪奇？
Right, Dicky?

113
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,455
我从他身上提取的组织样本似乎已经死亡，
The tissue samples I took from him appear to be dead,

114
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,800
-但我相信有一个合乎逻辑的.-合乎逻辑的解释。
- but I'm sure there's a logical... - Logical explanation.

115
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,680
你知道吗，王牌，你的声音一天比一天更像个大人物了。
You know, ace, you're starting to sound more like the big cheese every day.

116
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,480
我可以问一下，这具相当健谈的身体现在在哪里吗？
May I ask where this rather loquacious cadaver is, presently?

117
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
在迪克搞到什么东西让身体冷冻之前，
Until Dick can whip up something to keep the body frozen,

118
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,760
韦恩先生让我们把他冰冻起来。
Mr. Wayne had us put him on ice.

119
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,640
他指示我把Grendon先生放进冷冻室，Alfred。
He instructed me to put Mr. Grendon in the meat freezer, Alfred.

120
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,360
我真的很期待去拿今晚的烤肉。
I do so look forward to fetching this evening's roast.

121
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
(布鲁斯)“虽然我迷失了方向，
(Bruce) 'Though I am strayed,

122
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,520
我的遗嘱将留在哥谭市。
my Testament shall remain in Gotham.

123
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,040
-永远在我的城堡里。“-(门打开了)
-Forever in my keep.' -(door opens)

124
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,200
布鲁斯少爷，关于这个格兰登。
Master Bruce, about this Grendon.

125
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,840
-也许是时候再来一次……-哥谭市处于危险之中。
- Perhaps it's time for another... - Gotham is in danger.

126
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
你是从Cobblepot的日记里收集到的吗，先生？
You gleaned that from Cobblepot's journal, sir?

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
我现在肯定了。
I'm sure of it now.

128
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,760
但从你告诉我的情况来看，
But from what you told me,

129
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,600
这位教授神志不清。
the professor was not of sound mind.

130
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,440
相信我，阿尔弗雷德，我考虑过这一点。
Believe me, Alfred, I took that into consideration.

131
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,280
抛开疯狂的咆哮不谈，他的日记证实了我所发现的许多东西
Unhinged rantings aside, his journal confirms much of what I've uncovered

132
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
关于古代邪教的存在。
about the existence of an ancient cult.

133
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,000
如果他写的任何东西都是真的，
And if any of what he writes is true,

134
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,840
这是一个与哥谭市有着长期联系的邪教组织。
it's a cult that has long ties to Gotham.

135
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,480
那我应该把这理解为..。
Then should I take this to mean...

136
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,280
我们离开已经20年了，阿尔弗雷德。
It's been 20 years since we left, Alfred.

137
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,680
准备了二十年。
Twenty years preparing.

138
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
现在..。
And now...

139
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
是时候了。
It's time.

140
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
我们要回家了。
We're going home.

141
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,320
(喇叭风箱)
(horn bellows)

142
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
你觉得我们会在哥谭市待多久？
How long you figure we'll be in Gotham?

143
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,720
我们是来做好事的，孩子。
We're here for good, kid.

144
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,080
(李凯)马毛！
(Kai Li) Horsefeathers!

145
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,640
在我和你在一起的两年里
In the two years I've been with you

146
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,280
我们没有在任何城市逗留超过几个星期。
we haven't stayed in any city for more than a few weeks.

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
仔细想想..。
Come to think of it...

148
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,680
我在任何一个城市停留的时间从未超过几周。
I've never stayed in any city for more than a few weeks.

149
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,280
我和布鲁斯一起旅行已经有十年了，李开复。
I've been traveling with Bruce coming on a decade now, Kai Li.

150
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,360
一直以来都是为了回到哥谭市。
And it's always been about returning to Gotham.

151
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,760
好吧，但回来是为了什么？
Okay, but returning for what?

152
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,080
-(咯咯笑)-(呻吟)
- (chuckles) - (groans)

153
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
(险恶的笑声)
(sinister chuckling)

154
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,600
厄运。
Doom.

155
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
你回来是为了你的末日。
You return for your doom.

156
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,280
你疯了，你这个土豆。
Nuts to you, ya rank spud.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
高谭市似乎变得有点……
It appears Gotham has become a bit more...

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,880
无人照看比我们记忆中的要多。
Untended than we remember it.

159
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
希望这和我记忆中的不一样，阿尔弗雷德。
Let's hope it's nothing like I remember it, Alfred.

160
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,640
哥谭市的历史就是我们的历史，儿子。
(Thomas) Gotham's history is our history, son.

161
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,360
韦恩家族史。
Wayne family history.

162
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
韦恩家族建造了这座城市，布鲁斯。
The Waynes built this city, Bruce.

163
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,120
这让你成为长期遗产的一部分。
That makes you part of a long legacy.

164
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
什么是遗产？
What's a legacy?

165
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,840
这意味着，总有一天，你会有一双很大的鞋子要填补。
It means, one day, you'll have very big shoes to fill.

166
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,360
来吧，玛莎。
Come now, Martha.

167
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,360
更重要的是，一个男人要学会自立
It's more important a man learn to stand on his own feet

168
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,840
然后再把它们塞进别人的鞋子里。
before cramming them into someone else's shoes.

169
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
对不对，儿子？
Isn't that right, son?

170
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
我们把这个诅咒带到了我们身上！
We have brought this curse upon us!

171
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,400
(两人都在咕哝)
(both grunting)

172
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
托马斯！
Thomas!

173
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
(呻吟)
(groans)

174
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,560
布鲁斯，快跑！只是..。(呻吟)
Bruce, run! Just... (groans)

175
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,280
(疯狂地大笑)
(laughs maniacally)

176
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,120
(模糊不祥的窃窃私语)
(indistinct ominous whispering)

177
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
(生物尖叫)
(creatures screeching)

178
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,680
格兰登安全了，长官。
Grendon's secure, sir.

179
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,680
你确定要我们把他留在这里吗？
You sure you want us to just leave him here?

180
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
就目前而言。
For now.

181
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,040
如果他接触过那种病毒...
If he was exposed to that virus...

182
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,840
我不相信哥谭市警方会采取和我们一样的预防措施。
I don't trust the Gotham Police to use the same precautions we have.

183
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
明白了。
Understood.

184
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,760
但我需要你们中的一个留下来盯着他。
But I'll need one of you to stay back and keep an eye on him.

185
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,040
(李凯)真倒霉，桑杰。
(Kai Li) Tough luck, Sanjay.

186
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
该死的。
Damn it.

187
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
是的是的，船长。
Aye aye, Cap.

188
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,640
何乐而不为呢？
And why not?

189
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,280
在海上航行了几个月后，在这艘漂亮的船上再呆几天有什么意义？
After months at sea, what's a few more days on this fine vessel?

190
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,080
这会让我有机会和这具疯人病的身体亲热。
It'll give me a chance to cozy up with the nutso diseased corpse.

191
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,400
听到了吗？现在只有你和我了，零号先生。
Hear that? Just you and me now, Mr. Zero.

192
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
卢修斯。
Lucius.

193
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
很高兴见到你。
So good to see you.

194
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,000
你也是，儿子。
You as well, son.

195
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,440
干得好，阿尔弗雷德。你把他完好无损地带回了家。
Nice work, Alfred. You brought him home in one piece.

196
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,960
不是因为他不努力，老朋友。
Not for his lack of trying, old friend.

197
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,120
生意怎么样，卢修斯？
How's business, Lucius?

198
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
太棒了。
Copacetic.

199
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,000
只要董事会相信
So long as the board believes

200
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,720
所有的行政指令都来自你，也就是说。
all executive directives are coming from you, that is.

201
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,080
出于某种原因，
For some reason,

202
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,920
他们只是觉得听我的命令很不自在。
they just don't seem quite comfortable taking orders from me.

203
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,080
好吧，那么，
Well then,

204
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,560
我想你只需要继续确保我所有的指令都是...
I guess you'll just have to continue making sure that all my directives are...

205
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
太棒了。
Copacetic.

206
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,680
(笑)我打算这么做。
(laughs) I plan to.

207
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,080
你收到我最后一批货了吗？
And you received my last consignment?

208
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,080
就像你多年来的所有货物一样，
Like all your shipments over the years,

209
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,880
我把所有东西都放在酒窖里
I had everything situated in the wine cellar

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,760
符合您的精确规格。
to your precise specifications.

211
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,800
谢谢你，卢修斯。
Thank you, Lucius.

212
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
有一件事。
One thing...

213
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
酒窖？
Wine cellar?

214
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,320
我们不要把它浪漫化了。
Let's not romanticize it.

215
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
这是个山洞。
It's a cave.

216
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,200
(李凯)哇。哇。
(Kai Li) Whoa. Wow.

217
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
很时髦。
Swanky.

218
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
布鲁斯少爷，
Master Bruce,

219
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,560
看来你回来的消息已经传开了，先生。
it appears word of your return has spread, sir.

220
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,320
奥利弗·奎因邀请你共进晚餐和饮料。
Oliver Queen has invited you for dinner and drinks.

221
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,400
我假设他打算强调后者。
I shall assume he intends an emphasis on the latter.

222
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
布鲁斯少爷？
Master Bruce?

223
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,520
有些事不对劲。
Something isn't right.

224
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
(李凯喊道)
(Kai Li yells)

225
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
爪印？
Claw marks?

226
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,720
这是某种动物袭击。
It's some sort of animal attack.

227
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,280
-也许是熊？-不是.
- A bear, maybe? - No.

228
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
伤口是自下而上缝合的。
The wounds are made bottom up.

229
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,640
熊爪子不能做这种动作。
Ursine claws are incapable of that kind of movement.

230
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
这块瘀伤。
This bruise...

231
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,560
-勒死。-意思是做这件事的人有拇指.
- Strangulation. - Means whatever did this had thumbs.

232
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,000
显然，他是在别处被杀并被带到这里的。
Obviously, he was killed elsewhere and brought here.

233
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
但是为什么呢？
But why?

234
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
我是..。
I am...

235
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,240
朗斯特罗姆。
Langstrom.

236
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,440
(倒吸一口气)
(gasps)

237
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
布鲁斯，怎么了？
Bruce, what is it?

238
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
你有没有。
Did you...

239
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
阿。不要紧。
Ah. Nevermind.

240
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,920
我们要不要通知警方？
Should we notify the police?

241
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
是。
Yes.

242
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
但是，现在还不是时候。
But, not yet.

243
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
交给我吧。
I'll handle it.

244
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
(阿尔弗雷德)先生，您确定要来吃晚饭吗？
(Alfred) Are you sure you're up for dinner, sir?

245
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,960
布鲁斯：这所房子已经被封了20年了
(Bruce) This house has been sealed for 20 years

246
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,040
而楼下的身体对这件事也没有任何帮助。
and the corpse downstairs isn't doing the fustiness any favors.

247
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,880
至少，我们可以忍受新鲜的空气。
At the very least, we could stand the fresh air.

248
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,640
再说了，自从我们相遇后我就没见过奥利弗了。
Besides, I haven't seen Oliver since we ran into each other in...

249
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
杜尚别。
Dushanbe.

250
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,200
我叫布拉德。
My name is Blood.

251
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,960
你不会想知道我或者我是什么
You do not want to know me or what I am.

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,120
我只想说，
Suffice it to say,

253
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,640
大多数人看不见的东西，我却看得见。
what is invisible to most is visible to me.

254
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,480
是真地吗？
Is that so?

255
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,400
1908年6月26日
June 26th, 1908.

256
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,240
你亲眼目睹了你父母的谋杀。
You witnessed your parents' murder.

257
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,440
在接下来的几年里，你踏上了这个世界，
In the ensuing years, you set upon the world,

258
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,120
吸收了犯罪学、心理学、武术的各种形式。
absorbing all forms of criminology, psychology, martial art...

259
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,560
任何你认为有一天为父母报仇所必需的技能
Whatever skills you deemed necessary to one day avenge your parents' deaths

260
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,400
成为这座城市的救世主。
and become this city's savior.

261
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
蝙蝠。
The Bat.

262
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,520
你说的有道理吗，布拉德先生？
Do you have a point, Mr. Blood?

263
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,920
布鲁斯·韦恩，你的返校节已经启动了。
Your homecoming has set certain wheels in motion, Bruce Wayne.

264
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
虽然我知道的很多，
And though I know much,

265
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,840
我只被允许告诉你这三件事。
I'm only allowed to tell you these things three.

266
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,080
一。
One.

267
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,360
你必须找出两个幽灵。
You must seek out two spirits.

268
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
(笑)
(laughs)

269
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
幽灵？
Spirits?

270
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,120
一个被蝙蝠包裹着，另一个被火焰包裹着。
One wrapped in bats, the other in flames.

271
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,520
二。
Two.

272
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,840
要想赢得胜利，布鲁斯·韦恩必须死
To prevail in this, Bruce Wayne must die

273
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
通过死亡成为他自己。
and through death become himself.

274
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
三。
Three.

275
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,720
在它被拯救之前，
Before it can be saved,

276
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,920
哥谭市。
Gotham...

277
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,080
一定会被烧成灰烬。
must be burned to the ground.

278
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,880
听着，我不知道你在玩什么把戏，
Listen, I'm not sure what your game is,

279
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,480
但我对鬼故事不感兴趣。
but I'm not big on ghost stories.

280
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,320
你的疑虑将会毁了你。
Your dubiety will be your undoing.

281
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
(咕噜声)
(grunts)

282
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,000
你想谈谈解脱吗？
You wanna talk undoing?

283
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,160
(布鲁斯叹息)
(Bruce groans)

284
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,200
你在这里找不到敌人，我的笨蛋朋友。
You'll find no enemy here, my thickheaded friend.

285
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,080
当你面对你的敌人时，请放心，
Rest assured when you face your foe,

286
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,360
你会再见到我的。
you'll see me again.

287
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,640
我已经把车准备好了……
I've readied the car for...

288
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
正餐。
dinner.

289
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,360
然后布鲁斯对那个人说：“对不起，警官，那是狗毛。”
And then Bruce says to the man, 'Sorry constable, it was dog fur.'

290
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
(笑)
(laughing)

291
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
(笑)
(laughs)

292
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
事情并不是这样发展的，奥利。
That's not quite how it went, Ollie.

293
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,160
哦，来吧，布鲁西，你得美化一下。
Oh, come on, Brucey, you gotta embellish.

294
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,200
这就是表演技巧。对吧，凯利？
It's called showmanship. Right, Kelley?

295
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,680
我是李凯。
It's Kai Li.

296
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
太好了。
Attagirl.

297
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,240
噢。我听说你在南部遇到了哥谭市最好的人之一。
Oh. I hear you ran into one of Gotham's finest down south.

298
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
放松点，伙计们。
Easy, fellas.

299
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,880
早在远征之前，老科布尔波特就像三月兔一样疯了。
Old Cobblepot was mad as a march hare well before his expedition.

300
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,880
奎恩先生，我注意到你喜欢打猎。
So, Mr. Queen, I notice you're into hunting.

301
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,040
这是一种带着我周游世界的激情。
It's a passion that's taken me around the world.

302
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,840
不是动植物活着就能打败奥利弗·奎因的。
Not a matter of flora nor fauna alive, that can best Oliver Queen.

303
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,600
你知道植物就是植物，对吧？
You do know flora are plants, right?

304
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
当然了。
Of course.

305
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
我坚持我的主张。
And I stand by my assertion.

306
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,400
-什么植物可以...-(门铃响)
- For what plant could... - (doorbell dings)

307
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
哦，恶霸！我的惊喜嘉宾。
Oh, bully! My surprise guest.

308
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
布鲁斯和我的老朋友之一
One of Bruce and my oldest chums

309
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,800
以及将独自清理我们失落城市恶臭街道的人，
and the man who will single-handedly clean the fetid streets of our lost city,

310
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,920
我向你们介绍高谭市未来的市长哈维·登特。
I give you Gotham's future mayor, Harvey Dent.

311
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,760
我们不要数鸡了，奥利。
Let's not count chickens, Ollie.

312
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
选举还有四天才开始，而且..。
Election's not for four days and...

313
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,600
我会..。
I'll be...

314
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,000
布鲁斯·韦恩。
Bruce Wayne.

315
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
看看你，孩子。
Look at you, kid.

316
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,720
很高兴见到你，哈维。已经太久了。
Good to see you, Harvey. It's been too long.

317
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,120
看看我们三个。又在一起了。
And look at us three. Together again.

318
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,760
所以..。
So...

319
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,080
你要请我喝一杯吗，
You gonna offer me a drink,

320
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
或者不？
or not?

321
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,320
(电话铃声)
(telephone ringing)

322
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
韦恩的住所。
Wayne residence.

323
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,880
韦恩先生出去过夜了。
Mr. Wayne is out for the evening.

324
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,440
-有什么我可以...-(线路断开)
- Is there a message I could... - (line disconnects)

325
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,520
然后，哈夫，我看着这个露珠般的正方形的眼睛。
So then, Harv, I look this dewdropper square in his eyes.

326
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,640
我说，‘对不起，警员，
And I say, 'Sorry constable,

327
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,360
那是鸭毛。
it was duck fur.'

328
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,120
(笑)
(laughing)

329
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,200
告诉我，哈维。
Tell me something, Harv.

330
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
你对‘朗斯特罗姆’这个名字有什么印象吗？
Does the name 'Langstrom' mean anything to you?

331
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
柯克·朗斯特罗姆教授？
Professor Kirk Langstrom?

332
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,080
犯罪小巷的蝙蝠侠？
The Batman of crime alley?

333
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,200
他比科布尔波特还疯狂。
He's loonier than Cobblepot.

334
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
仔细想想，
Come to think of it,

335
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,280
最近疯人院的数量有所增加，
there has been an uptick in crackpots lately,

336
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,080
这说明了一些问题。
which is saying something.

337
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,120
哥谭市总是有比我们公平份额更多的翼果。
Gotham's always had more than our fair share of wingnuts.

338
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,600
朗斯特罗姆是该大学的生物学家。
Langstrom is a biologist at the university.

339
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,200
实际上，他是一名翼翼学家。
A chiropterologist, actually.

340
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,960
最近，他臭名昭著地发展了一种
Of late, he's rather infamously developed an

341
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,440
对他研究的蝙蝠的不健康的痴迷。
unhealthy obsession with the bats he studies.

342
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,800
怎么会不健康？
Unhealthy how?

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,240
他声称自己就是其中之一。
He claims to be one.

344
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,080
你能告诉我他的地址吗？
Would you have an address for him?

345
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,800
在罗宾街的某个地方。我给办公室打个电话。
Somewhere in Robin's Row. I'll call the office.

346
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,320
先生们，说到办公室，
Speaking of the office, gentlemen,

347
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,680
我必须在六个小时后向它报到。
I have to report to it in six hours.

348
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,800
丹特先生，下次你得教我怎么玩硬币戏法。
You'll have to show me how to do that coin trick next time, Mr. Dent.

349
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
抱歉，运动先生。
Sorry, sport.

350
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,200
魔术师不会洒出来的。
Magicians don't spill.

351
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,600
我们最好也退休了。
We'd best retire as well.

352
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
-我说，奥利...-嗯？
- Say, Ollie... - Huh?

353
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
因为阿尔弗雷德还在给房子通风，
Since Alfred's still airing out the house,

354
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,200
你介意为我们安排过夜吗？
would you mind putting us up for the night?

355
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,560
介意吗？我去叫更多的雪利酒。
Mind? I'll ring for more sherry.

356
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
盯着奥利弗。
Keep an eye on Oliver.

357
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,440
我开始觉得桑杰抽到了幸运的稻草。
I'm beginning to think Sanjay drew the lucky straw.

358
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,040
(格兰登)首先，我以为我失败了。
(Grendon) First, I thought I failed.

359
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
但我感觉到了他那冰冷的礼物在我体内的力量。
But I feel the power of his cold gift inside me.

360
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
(满腹牢骚)
(grumbles)

361
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
闭嘴..。
Shut your yap...

362
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
噢！
Ow!

363
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,800
(险恶的笑声)
(sinister chuckling)

364
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,480
别装模作样了，好吗？
Just dummy up, would ya?

365
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
所有人！
Everybody!

366
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,920
(唱)艾达
(singing) Ida

367
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,440
甜得像苹果酒
Sweet as apple cider

368
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,680
比我所知道的一切都甜蜜
Sweeter than all I know

369
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
出来
Come out

370
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,320
在银色的月光下。
In the silvery moonlight...

371
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,120
布鲁斯在哪？
Where's Bruce?

372
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,800
如果他够聪明，就回南极洲。
If he's smart, back in Antarctica.

373
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
低，低，低
Low, low, low, low, low

374
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
所有人！
Everybody!

375
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,720
(警官)女房东说听起来像是谋杀。
(officer) Landlady said it sounded like a murder.

376
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,160
我没看到身体。
I don't see no bodies.

377
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,880
你在找身体，小家伙。
You look for bodies, junior.

378
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,520
像朗斯特罗姆这样的怪人，
Screwballs like Langstrom,

379
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,880
一定要储藏一些面团。
always keep some dough squirreled away.

380
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
快点找到它，好吗？在戈登回来之前。
Hurry up and find it, will ya? Before Gordon gets back...

381
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
跳起来了，吉米尼！
Jumped up jimminy!

382
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,400
找到你要找的东西了吗？
Find what you were looking for?

383
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,360
让这个狗娘养的通风。
Ventilate this son of a bitch.

384
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,120
(呻吟)
(groaning)

385
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
(不寒而栗)
(shuddering)

386
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,960
(呻吟)
(groans)

387
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
朗斯特罗姆。
Langstrom...

388
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,560
你是不是进了地狱？
The hell were you into?

389
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,920
好了，伙计们。我们来包装一下..。
Okay, boys. Let's wrap the...

390
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
这是什么.。
What the...

391
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,000
(电话铃声)
(telephone ringing)

392
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
韦恩的住所。
Wayne residence.

393
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,240
我已经说过三次了，芭芭拉女士
As I've stated thrice already, Ms. Barbara,

394
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,080
韦恩先生出去过夜了。
Mr. Wayne is out for the evening.

395
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,600
-现在，我一定会送到...-(线路断开)
- Now, I will certainly deliver... - (line disconnects)

396
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,040
(朗斯特罗姆)‘如果你正在读这篇文章，
(Langstrom) 'If you're reading this,

397
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,240
我，柯克·朗斯特罗姆博士已经死了。
I, Dr. Kirk Langstrom, am dead.

398
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
谢天谢地。
Thankfully.

399
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,240
因为一场大灾难即将降临到这个世界上。
For a great doom is coming to this world.

400
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,240
尽管你会认为我疯了，相信我，如果你可以的话。
Though you will think me mad, believe me, if you can.

401
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,240
蝙蝠跟我说话。
The bats speak to me.

402
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,400
他们看到的是人类敢于探索的东西。
They see beyond what man dare fathom.

403
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,920
他们告诉我
And they tell me

404
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,640
日益增长的恐怖。
of a growing horror.

405
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,120
一个东西，蜷缩在我们现实的家门口。
A thing, crouching, at the doorstep of our reality.

406
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,640
它渴望着我们的到来。
And it is hungry for us.

407
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,720
它想要我们的世界。
And it wants our world.

408
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,120
几个世纪以来，这种邪恶的追随者，“Ghul的崇拜”
For centuries, acolytes of this evil, the 'Cult of Ghul'

409
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,880
努力打开那扇将事物与我们现实隔绝的大门。
have endeavored to unlock the very door that keeps the thing from our reality.

410
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,760
现在，他们的时代
And now, their time

411
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,760
就快到了。
is nigh.

412
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,480
然而，仍有一线希望。
Yet, there is still a single hope.

413
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,600
他们需要一本书，
They require a book,

414
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,720
古尔的遗嘱。
The Testament of Ghul.

415
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,040
因为只有用它的页面中包含的知识
For only with the knowledge contained in its pages

416
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,920
愿他们打开那扇门。
may they open that door.

417
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,200
遗嘱必须不惜一切代价不让他们知道。
The Testament must be kept from them, at all costs.'

418
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,680
遗嘱。
Testament.

419
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,640
“我的遗嘱将留在哥谭市。
'My Testament shall remain in Gotham.

420
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,320
永远在我的牢房里。
Forever in my keep.'

421
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,560
科布尔波特拿到了。
Cobblepot had it.

422
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
(电话铃声)
(telephone ringing)

423
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,720
大学储藏室。我是曼福德教授。
University repository. Professor Manfurd speaking.

424
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,760
你有Cobblepot教授的记录吗？
(man) Do you have keep of Professor Cobblepot's records?

425
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,920
在他休假的时候，是的。请问您是哪位？
While he's on sabbatical, yes. Who is this, please?

426
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,000
古尔的遗嘱。
The Testament of Ghul...

427
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,120
我需要它。
I need it.

428
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
关于……的遗书
Testament of...

429
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
不，我不熟悉这样的文字。
No, I am not familiar with such a text.

430
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,440
当然，这不是借阅图书馆，先生。
Of course, this is not a lending library, sir.

431
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,000
这是大学图书馆
This is the university repository

432
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,521
-仅限公众使用，如果您...-(线路断开)
- restricted to the public, if you... - (line disconnects)

433
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,240
科布尔波特命令我毁了你。
Cobblepot ordered me to destroy you.

434
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,840
哦，但即使我可以，我也不会。
Oh, but even if I could, I would not.

435
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,640
作为一个人，我对此感到非常高兴。
I, for one, am so very glad at that.

436
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,760
塔莉亚？但如何做到呢？
Talia? But how?

437
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,120
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

438
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
好的。
Good.

439
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,800
求求你，不要杀我！
Please, don't kill me!

440
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,760
我们会把那件事留给..。
We'll leave that business to...

441
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
戴蒂娅。
Daitya.

442
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
不是的！
No!

443
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
(呻吟)
(groaning)

444
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
(倒吸一口气)
(gasps)

445
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,720
《遗嘱》。现在!
The Testament. Now!

446
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,440
(嘲讽)不。
(scoffs) No.

447
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,280
随你便，戴蒂娅。
Do as you will, Daitya.

448
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
这是什么.。
What the...

449
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
(咆哮)
(roars)

450
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,040
(蝙蝠侠叹息)
(Batman groans)

451
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,840
(咆哮)
(roaring)

452
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,160
埃特里根。
Etrigan.

453
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,640
有人告诉你，你不知道自己面对的是什么。
You were told you know not what you face.

454
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,000
然而只有你能阻止它，所以离开这个地方。
Yet only you can stop it, so leave this place.

455
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
(两人都在咕哝)
(both grunting)

456
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,480
我的牺牲是为了让你结束这个诅咒。
My sacrifice is made so you might end this curse.

457
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,880
唉，如果这本书仍然是她的，那就一文不值了！
Alas, it'd be for naught should the book remain hers!

458
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,560
(蝙蝠侠)让我们再试一次。
(Batman) Let's try this again.

459
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,760
这本书。现在。
The book. Now.

460
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,680
别以为你的装扮会吓到我，蝙蝠。
Do not think your costume can frighten me, Bat.

461
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,760
我很熟悉恶魔、精灵和魔鬼的真实情况。
I am well acquainted with real matter of demon, Djinn and devil.

462
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,160
无论Ghul的邪教计划是什么，它都在这里结束。
Whatever the Cult of Ghul is planning, it ends here.

463
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,160
对古尔的崇拜在几个世纪前就消亡了。
The Cult of Ghul perished centuries ago.

464
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,560
我是它最后的..。
I am its last...

465
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
就目前而言。
For now.

466
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
(呻吟)
(groans)

467
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,320
在你的书房里给你留下了惊喜之后，
After leaving you that surprise in your study,

468
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
我很确定，你会意识到
I was certain, you'd realize

469
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
我不是一个可以玩弄的人。
I was not one to be trifled with.

470
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
你知道我会带你去看《圣经》。
You knew I'd lead you to The Testament.

471
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,400
你杀了朗斯特罗姆。(呻吟)
You killed Langstrom. (groans)

472
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,880
你对这本书所拥有的力量一无所知。
You have no clue the power this book possesses.

473
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,680
我知道那些寻求它的人想要伤害这座城市。
I know those who seek it mean to do this city harm.

474
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,680
恰恰相反。
Quite the contrary.

475
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,520
我们打算赋予这座城市以目标，并尊重它所遭受的诅咒。
We mean to give this city purpose and honor the damnation which bore it.

476
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,320
你，从另一方面来说，
You, on the other hand,

477
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,200
我们想要造成伤害。
we mean to do harm.

478
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,600
这不可能。
It can't be.

479
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
又是一个怪物。
Another monster.

480
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,240
(咕哝着)
(grunting)

481
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,400
(咆哮)
(roaring)

482
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,120
你不会走812年
You don't go 812 years

483
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,280
却没有交到你那份有趣的朋友。
without making your share of interesting friends.

484
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,720
(呻吟)
(groaning)

485
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,120
(蝙蝠侠咕哝着)
(Batman grunts)

486
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
(喇叭吹响)
(horn blows)

487
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,880
(蝙蝠侠气喘吁吁)
(Batman panting)

488
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,920
(呻吟)
(groaning)

489
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,120
蝙蝠还活着。
The bat still lives.

490
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,440
嗯。不管了。
Mm. No matter.

491
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,360
他不会对我们构成严重威胁。
He poses no serious threat to us.

492
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,200
另外，还有一件事需要你去办。
Besides, you are needed for another errand.

493
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,760
钥匙已经送到港口了。
The key has been delivered to the harbor.

494
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
把它拿回来。
Retrieve it.

495
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
(打鼾声)
(snoring)

496
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,800
想一想，在我们给彼此的信中，
To think, in our letters to each other,

497
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,840
我曾经因为布鲁斯在每个港口收集一只流浪的碎屑而责备他。
I used to rib Bruce for collecting a stray ragamuffin at every port.

498
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,040
但是你们两个。
But you two...

499
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,760
你们两个平心静气。
You two are on the level.

500
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,080
当然，你不可能比布鲁斯·韦恩做得更好。
Of course, you can do no better than Bruce Wayne.

501
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
布鲁斯。
Bruce.

502
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,200
我欠他一个人情。
I owe the man.

503
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,200
(抽泣)
(sobbing)

504
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,880
主啊，我欠他的比他知道的还多。
Lord, I owe him more than he could possibly know.

505
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,360
我很抱歉，布鲁西...
I'm so sorry, Brucey...

506
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,280
真的很抱歉。
So sorry.

507
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,520
好了，放松点。
All right, easy there.

508
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,200
我相信一切都很好，先生。
I'm sure everything is fine, sir.

509
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,920
韦恩先生不是那种对好人怀恨在心的人。
Mr. Wayne isn't one to hold a grudge against a good man.

510
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,800
来吧，我们去睡一会儿吧。
Come on, let's get some sleep.

511
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,680
但我是吗？一个好人？
Am I though? A good man?

512
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,680
永远不要忘记，
Never forget,

513
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,520
父亲的罪加在儿子身上。
the sins of the father are heaped upon the son.

514
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,360
谢谢你，奎恩先生。很高兴知道。
Thanks, Mr. Queen. Good to know.

515
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
(打哈欠)
(yawns)

516
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
阿尔弗雷德。
Alfred.

517
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
布鲁斯少爷。
Master Bruce.

518
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
发生了什么事？
What's happened?

519
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,880
不太确定。现在还不行。
Not sure. Yet.

520
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,760
(鼻子)那是硫磺吗？
(sniffs) Is that sulfur?

521
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,360
你受伤了。我得打扫一下..。
You're wounded. I have to clean...

522
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,400
还没。我必须分析这种物质。
Not yet. I have to analyze this substance.

523
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,200
当我再次遇到变异生物的时候。
For when I run into the mutated creature again.

524
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,960
变异生物？
Mutated creature?

525
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,480
等等，你要去哪里？
Wait, where are you off to?

526
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,080
洞穴。我们还有工作要做。
The cave. We have work to do.

527
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,320
这是个酒窖，布鲁斯少爷。
It's a wine cellar, Master Bruce.

528
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,000
我们不是尼安德特人
We're not Neanderthals

529
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
孩子们..。
Boys...

530
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,680
现在还是六月，不是吗？
It is still June, isn't it?

531
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
(喇叭响)
(horn blares)

532
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,160
等等，孩子。这艘船是禁区。
Hold up, kid. Ship's off limits.

533
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
嘿，伙计们。
Heya, boys.

534
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,800
奥利弗·奎恩。
Oliver Queen.

535
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,160
你在这里干嘛？
What are you doing here?

536
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,080
你还在等十几箱你的私酒，是吗？
Expecting another dozen cases of your bootleg hooch, are we?

537
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,680
藐视禁酒法
And flout the prohibition laws

538
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,560
帮助高谭市保持我们都喜欢的美好而纯洁的城市？
that help keep Gotham the fine and chaste city we've all come to love?

539
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,960
为什么，吉米·戈登，你杀了我！
Why, Jimmy Gordon, you slay me!

540
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
不过，告诉你吧，
Tell you what though,

541
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,120
如果我真的碰到了一个案子，我会让你看着我把它处理完。
if I do happen upon a case, I'll let you watch me polish it off.

542
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,895
至少到那时，你和你的兄弟们可以看到
At least then, you and your boys can see

543
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,160
追查案件的真相到底是什么样子。
what getting to the bottom of a case actually looks like.

544
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,960
别管它了，女王！听着，儿子..。
Get off it, Queen! Now listen, son...

545
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
(引擎启动)
(engine starts)

546
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
快走，快走！
Go, go!

547
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,520
(不寒而栗)
(shudders)

548
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
桑杰？
Sanjay?

549
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
桑杰？
Sanjay?

550
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,120
杰伊？(倒吸一口气)
Jay? (gasps)

551
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
(叹息)
(sighs)

552
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,680
桑杰。
Sanjay...

553
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
(格兰登笑了)
(Grendon laughing)

554
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,800
(奥利弗)如果我是你，我会放聪明点的，吉米。
(Oliver) I'd wise up if I were you, Jimmy.

555
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,280
三天后就是选举了。
The election's in three days.

556
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,200
如果一切顺利，我最好的朋友哈维·登特将成为你的老板。
If all goes pepper, my best chum, Harvey Dent, will be your boss.

557
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,160
-想想未来……-(枪声)
- Think about the future... - (gunshots)

558
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
(在远处尖叫)
(screaming in distance)

559
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
(倒吸一口气)
(gasps)

560
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
仁慈。
Mercy.

561
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,600
赶快。让我过去。
Come on. Let me through.

562
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
头儿想让我们把你..。
Chief wants us to keep you...

563
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,000
不是的！
No!

564
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,000
-不！不，没关系！-不！
- No! No, it's okay! - No!

565
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,560
-不！-没关系
- No! - It's okay.

566
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,000
(抽泣)不！不是的！
(sobbing) No! No!

567
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,600
我抓到你了。我抓到你了。我知道呀。
I've got you. I've got you. I know.

568
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,000
我知道呀。我知道，发泄出来吧。
I know. I know, let it out.

569
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,880
没关系，发泄出来吧。
It's okay, let it out.

570
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,760
这是什么造成的？
What did this?

571
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,920
我不知道，李凯。
I don't know, Kai Li.

572
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,520
但在主的手中。
But by the Lord's hand...

573
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,880
他们会付出代价的。
they will pay.

574
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,600
几千年前，
Millennia ago,

575
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,800
你来到这些邪恶的地方来学习邪恶的秘密。
you descended upon these wicked grounds to learn secrets unholy.

576
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,520
现在，我要用这些秘密再给你一次生命。
Now, I shall use those very secrets to give you life again.

577
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,920
然后，我们将一起把Iog-Sotha带入这个现实！
Then, together, we will usher Iog-Sotha into this reality!

578
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
戴蒂娅！
Daitya!

579
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,400
你来得正是时候。
You come in good time.

580
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,920
埃特里根..。
Etrigan...

581
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
确实是这样。
Indeed.

582
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,200
我提供了一个恶魔来代替你在你的瓶子监狱里的位置，精灵。
I furnished a demon to take your place in your bottle prison, Djinn.

583
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,600
现在，在回到地狱之前，你必须履行我们的约定。
Now, you must honor your end of our bargain before returning to Hell.

584
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,840
用你可怜的地狱之火烧焦这块被诅咒的土地吧。
Scorch this cursed ground with your wretched hellfire.

585
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,040
(念咒语)
(chanting incantation)

586
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,800
出来吧！
Come forth!

587
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,120
我女儿..。
My daughter...

588
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
(笑)
(laughs)

589
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
他已经崛起了。
He has risen.

590
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,360
Ra‘s al Ghul崛起了！
Ra's al Ghul has risen!

591
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,160
(布鲁斯)这座城市下面有几英里长的隧道。
(Bruce) There are miles of tunnel below this city.

592
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,320
塔利亚就在下面的某个地方。
Talia is down here somewhere.

593
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,120
您要的那本书，先生。
The book you requested, sir.

594
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,160
布鲁斯少爷，我绝对不会把自己算在‘信徒’之列。
I would certainly never count myself among the 'believers', Master Bruce.

595
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,520
但在我的时间里，我已经看到了足够多的东西，至少可以对黑魔法保持警惕。
But I have seen enough in my time to at least be wary of the dark arts.

596
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,400
我很感激你的关心，但我们没有时间搞迷信。
I appreciate the concern, but we don't have time for superstitions.

597
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
我的意思是，
I only mean,

598
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,680
或许明智的做法是不要轻视这些事情。
perhaps it would be wise to not discount such things out of hand.

599
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,760
我承认，我所看到的很多事情似乎违反了逻辑。
I'll admit a lot of what I've seen seems to defy logic.

600
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,080
但我向你保证
But I assure you

601
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,640
所有这一切背后都有一个合理的解释。
there's a rational explanation behind all of it.

602
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
这是什么？
What's this?

603
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,480
(阿尔弗雷德)“蛇的陵墓？”
(Alfred) 'The mausoleum of the serpent?'

604
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,880
在人类出现之前，就有了蛇。
'Before humans, there were serpents.

605
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,560
一种古老黑魔法的大师。
Masters of an ancient black magic.

606
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,480
在公元前2000年，一个黑暗的牧师，Ra‘s al Ghul，
In what would be 2000 BC, a dark priest, Ra's al Ghul,

607
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,040
揭开了他们邪恶之地的废墟。
uncovered the ruins of their unholy grounds.

608
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,640
使用巫术，他从他们那里夺取了他们的秘密。
Using necromantic arts, he wrested their secrets from them...

609
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,960
宇宙的本质是他可以运用的。
The nature of the cosmos was his to wield.

610
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,160
然而，拉的一个真正的愿望是服侍他的主人。
Yet, Ra's' one true desire was to serve his master...

611
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,520
IOG-Sotha。
Iog-Sotha.

612
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,360
并将他黑暗的外在上帝带入我们的现实。
And to bring his dark outer God into our reality.'

613
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,280
外星之神？
Outer gods?

614
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,040
都是虚构的阿尔弗雷德。
All myth, Alfred.

615
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,920
那这对我们有什么用呢？
Then of what use is this to us?

616
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,200
(布鲁斯)如果你足够认真地看任何神话，
(Bruce) If you look at any myth hard enough,

617
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,200
你会在下面找到事实的残余物。
you'll find the remnants of fact underneath.

618
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
阿克罗。
Aklo.

619
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,520
对不起，先生..。
I'm sorry, sir...

620
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,120
阿克罗？
Aklo?

621
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,560
蚀刻中的刻度线。
The tick marks in that etching.

622
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
这是一种古老的书写系统。
It's an ancient system of writing...

623
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
阿克罗。
Aklo.

624
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
它们不是扁虱。
They're not ticks.

625
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
它们是坐标。
They're coordinates.

626
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
事实。
Facts.

627
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
有可能吗？
Is it possible?

628
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,520
这座陵墓位于哥谭市的某个地方吗？
This mausoleum is located somewhere beneath Gotham?

629
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,760
我会查清楚的。
I'm going to find out.

630
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,160
检查一下我们的院子是否准备好了。
Check to see if our compound is ready.

631
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,080
一百万年来，Iog-Sotha一直渴望着这颗星球。
For a million, million years, Iog-Sotha has longed for this planet.

632
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,760
他在一扇他永远打不开的门上咆哮和刮擦。
He howls and scrapes at a door he can never open.

633
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,400
现在，我们要进入毒蛇的邪恶洞穴
Now, we shall descend into the unholy chamber of the serpents

634
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,400
并启动仪式，让我们看到这扇门。
and invoke the ceremony that will show us this door.

635
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,560
(塔利亚)没有钥匙是不能开门的。
(Talia) You can't open a door without a key.

636
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
(电话铃声)
(telephone ringing)

637
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,200
哦，天哪，又来了。
Oh, heavens, not again.

638
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
韦恩先生和我向你保证，韦恩先生还在..。
Wayne residence and I assure you, Mr. Wayne is still...

639
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,560
噢。戈登警长。我很抱歉，先生。
Oh. Chief Gordon. My apologies, sir.

640
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
我还以为是你的..。
I thought it was your...

641
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,680
我还以为是打错了。
I thought it was a wrong number.

642
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
大人..。
My Lord...

643
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,320
是的，当然。
Yes, of course.

644
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,600
如果奎恩先生能暂时照顾一下李开复，
If Mr. Queen could look after Kai Li for the time being,

645
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,400
我将不胜感激。
it would be most appreciated.

646
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,640
当他回来的那一刻，我...
And the moment he returns, I...

647
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,000
我会通知韦恩先生。
I shall inform Mr. Wayne.

648
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,520
(Ra‘s al Ghul)哦，你去吧，
(Ra's al Ghul) O thou Gog,

649
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,560
哦，你去吧，
O thou Gog,

650
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,840
哦，Kore..。没有珀尔塞福涅..。
O Kore... O Persephone...

651
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,600
哦，阿玛加，伊洛索塔，
O Amaga, Iog-Sotha,

652
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,480
时间之外的黑暗，
Darkness out of time,

653
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,600
让我们看看你的门
show us your door

654
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,400
这样我们就可以分享
so that we may partake

655
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,600
在这个神圣的目标中，最后..。
in this holy purpose and finally...

656
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,720
这是什么傲慢无礼的虫子？
What manner of insolent worm is this?

657
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,960
继续念咒语吧，神父。
Continue the incantation, Father.

658
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,600
我们会对付闯入者的。
We will deal with the interloper.

659
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
(咆哮)
(growling)

660
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,960
(呻吟，咆哮)
(groaning, roaring)

661
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,520
(塔利亚)你毁了他。
(Talia) You destroyed him.

662
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,960
这是什么魔法？
What magic is this?

663
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,640
不是魔法。
Not magic.

664
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,960
氯浓缩液。
Chlorine concentrate.

665
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
很好。
Very well.

666
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,400
天哪，你学得真快。
My, you are a quick study.

667
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,480
我想我得把你私下处理掉。
I suppose I'll have to dispose of you intimately.

668
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,320
-(咕噜声)-(叹息声)
- (grunts) - (groans)

669
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,240
(Ra的简历唱着圣歌)
(Ra's resumes chanting)

670
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
(咕噜声)
(grunts)

671
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,800
埃特里根..。
Etrigan...

672
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
(塔莉亚叹息)
(Talia groans)

673
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,960
够了，拉。
That's enough, Ra's.

674
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,680
不管你到底是谁，不管你玩什么把戏，
Whoever you really are and whatever your game is,

675
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
完了。
it's over.

676
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
(咯咯地笑)
(chuckling)

677
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,720
的确，
Indeed,

678
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,480
一切都结束了。
it is over...

679
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,040
(隆隆作响)
(rumbling)

680
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,600
等你过去吧。
Over for you.

681
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,240
(塔利亚)仪式完成了。
(Talia) The ritual is complete.

682
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,520
(嘶嘶声)
(hissing)

683
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,240
(Ra‘s al Ghul)爬行动物曾统治这个地球。
(Ra's al Ghul) Reptiles once ruled this earth.

684
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,400
现在，他们带着一场瘟疫回来了，这场瘟疫会把我们带到门口。
And now, they return with a plague that will lead us to the door.

685
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,120
去伊洛索塔！
To Iog-Sotha!

686
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
(Ra‘s al Ghul笑)
(Ra's al Ghul laughing)

687

(蝙蝠侠尖叫)
(Batman screams)

688
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,240
-(嘶嘶声)-(人们尖叫)
- (hissing) - (people screaming)

689
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,520
额外的，额外的！哥谭市齐膝深的蜥蜴！
Extra, extra! Gotham knee-deep in lizards!

690
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
(汽笛声)
(siren blaring)

691
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,920
(人们鼓掌)
(people clapping)

692
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,400
(哈维)谢谢。谢谢。
(Harvey) Thank you. Thank you.

693
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,920
当选后，这种侵扰将是我的首要任务。
When elected, this infestation will be my first priority.

694
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,400
我拒绝让这成为我们这座自豪而美丽的城市脸上的又一道伤疤。
I refuse to let this be another scar on the face of our proud, beautiful city.

695
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,480
好的，哈维！
(man) Yes, Harvey!

696
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,200
-我说够了！-(人们欢呼)
- I say enough! - (people cheering)

697
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,000
(蝙蝠侠呼气)
(Batman exhales)

698
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
(呻吟)
(groans)

699
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,360
(人们尖叫)
(people screaming)

700
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
(咕噜声)
(grunts)

701
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
(气喘吁吁)
(panting)

702
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,040
(气喘吁吁)
(gasping)

703
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,160
(扭曲的声音)事情来了。
(distorted voice) The thing is coming.

704
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,640
今天我们只向你们展示..。
Today we will only show you...

705
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,240
让你看看这东西的形状。
Show you the shape of the thing.

706
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,240
为了凝视它
For to gaze upon it

707
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,640
就是邀请疯狂！
is to invite madness!

708
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,440
尽管你的头脑可能会强迫自己忘记它所看到的，
And though your mind may force itself to forget what it sees,

709
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,360
它留下了疯狂的印记
the mark of madness it leaves behind

710
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,680
永远都是你的。
is yours for eternity.

711
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,680
唯一能阻止它的就是蝙蝠。
The only thing that can stop it is the Bat.

712
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,920
唯一能阻止它的是..。
The only thing that can stop it...

713
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,600
(尖叫声)
(screaming)

714
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,240
就是你！
is you!

715
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,200
(蝙蝠侠)我...记住。
(Batman) I... remember.

716
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,000
(钟声响起)
(bell tolling)

717
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,560
父亲?
Father?

718
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,600
(新闻播音员)这是刚刚收到的，是官方的，
(newsreader) And this just in, it's official,

719
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,440
哈维·登特是我们的下一任市长！
Harvey Dent is our next mayor!

720
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,320
鉴于仍然莫名其妙地突然消失
And in light of the sudden and miraculous disappearance of the still-inexplicable

721
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,040
爬行动物出没，人们不得不相信他的胜利是一个迹象
reptile infestation, one has to believe that his victory is a sign

722
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,920
哈维·登特确实是我们城市通向希望的大门。
that Harvey Dent is, indeed, our city's gateway to hope.

723
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,415
(哈维)我们在一起经历了这么多。
(Harvey) We've endured so much together.

724
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,560
作为市长，我承诺这将是哥谭市一个闪亮的新纪元。
As Mayor, I promise this will be a shining new era for Gotham.

725
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,200
IOG-Sotha已经说过了。
Iog-Sotha has spoken.

726
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,280
登特就是门。
Dent is the door.

727
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,600
那么剩下的就是找回密钥了。
Then all that remains is to retrieve the key.

728
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,480
-大师们，我告诉过你们.我不知道有钥匙。-(Ra‘s al Ghul)笨蛋。
- Masters, I told you. I know of no key. - (Ra's al Ghul) Imbecile.

729
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,200
你在冰中发现了伊洛索塔的儿子伊布·诺格罗斯。
You found Yib Nogeroth, son of Iog-Sotha, in the ice.

730
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,200
虽然他睡着了，但他执行了他父亲的遗嘱。
Though he sleeps, he carried out his father's will...

731
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,120
把他的种子种在你身上。
and planted his seed in you.

732
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,080
当然，是我内心的天赋。
Of course, the gift within me.

733
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,840
这就是关键！
This is the key!

734
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,840
告诉我，我能给你什么.(尖叫声)
Tell me, how may I give... (screams)

735
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,520
(呻吟)
(groaning)

736
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,520
IOG-Sotha，
Iog-Sotha,

737
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,000
把这件礼物做成一个新的容器。
make this gift a new vessel.

738
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,920
你的送货代理。
The agent of your delivery.

739
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,640
登特。
Dent.

740
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,960
(蝙蝠侠)末日...
(Batman) Doom...

741
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,600
厄运..。
Doom...

742
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,320
大灾难即将来临。在门口的台阶上。
The great doom is coming. It's at the doorstep.

743
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,040
他还没有离开这个地方，
He hasn't moved from this spot,

744
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,680
自从我找到他后，他连话都没跟我说。
nor so much as spoken to me since I found him.

745
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,400
甚至在你告诉他Tawde和Grayson先生的事之后？
Not even after you told him about misters Tawde and Grayson?

746
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,920
我担心，尤其是在那之后。
Particularly after, I'm afraid.

747
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred,

748
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,200
是时候给雨果打电话了。
it's time to call Hugo.

749
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,000
雅克罕姆的工作人员可以提供帮助。
The staff at Arkham can help.

750
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,080
(锁定并单击)
(locks clicking)

751
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,080
祝贺你，市长先生！
Congrats, Mr. Mayor!

752
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,760
谢谢你，皮特。但我才刚刚得到这份工作。
Thanks, Pete. But I only just got the job.

753
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,120
现在，是时候看看我是否能做到了。
Now, time to see if I can deliver.

754
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,520
(女)我相信你会的。
(woman) I'm sure you will.

755
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,800
人民对你充满信心。
The people have every faith in you.

756
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,120
(咯咯笑)谢谢你，女士。
(chuckles) Thank you, ma'am.

757
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,200
我不会让你失望的。
I won't let you down.

758
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,200
(倒吸一口气)
(gasps)

759
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,040
(奥利弗)你知道吗，孩子，我给那扇门上了三把锁是有原因的。
(Oliver) You know, kiddo, I had three locks put on that door for a reason.

760
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,200
抱歉，我想是好奇吧。
Sorry, I guess curiosity.

761
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,120
这是什么.。
What the...

762
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,080
奎恩先生？
Mr. Queen?

763
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,600
这是怎么回事？
What is all this?

764
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,520
很快，一个巨大的邪恶将降临到哥谭市。
Very soon, a great evil will befall Gotham.

765
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,520
这取决于我能不能打败它。
It's up to me to defeat it.

766
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,240
嗯，嗯。
Uh-huh.

767
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,520
我明白了。
I see.

768
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,520
还有，呃，怎么说？
And, uh, how's that?

769
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,240
你忘了吗？
Have you forgotten?

770
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,480
“父的罪加在儿子身上。”
'The sins of the Father are heaped upon the son.'

771
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,480
没有人比我父亲罪孽更重。
No man is guilty of more sin than my father.

772
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,400
尽管这似乎是不可能的，亨利·奎因已经300多岁了。
As impossible as it seems, Henry Queen was over 300 years old.

773
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,760
就这样，恶人与魔鬼达成了一项协议。
As it goes, the cur made a pact with the devil.

774
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,920
随着时间的推移，这让他发疯了。
Over time it drove him mad.

775
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
到了最后，
By the end,

776
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,640
这个可怜的混蛋不会拒绝任何卑鄙的行为。
there was no vile deed the wretched bastard would refuse.

777
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,680
包括冷血的谋杀案
Including the cold-blooded murder

778
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,080
托马斯和玛莎·韦恩的照片。
of Thomas and Martha Wayne.

779
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,400
他告诉我几个世纪前犯下的这一邪恶行为。
He told me of this unholy act perpetrated centuries ago.

780
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,960
一种如此邪恶、如此肮脏的行为，激起了这件事
An act so wicked, so foul, it stirred this thing

781
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,000
总有一天会摧毁高谭市。
that would one day destroy Gotham.

782
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,960
因此，反过来，我发誓要消除每一种罪过。
So, in turn, I vowed to undo each of those sins.

783
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,920
我开始准备面对这场即将到来的厄运，他警告说。
I set about preparing to face this impending doom he warned of.

784
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,440
测试我自己对抗致命野兽的能力。
Testing myself against deadly beasts.

785
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,920
收集各种神圣的武器。
Collecting all manner of holy weapons.

786
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,000
就像这四支箭。
Like these four arrows.

787
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,920
沾满了圣塞巴斯蒂安本人的鲜血。
Stained with the very blood of St. Sebastian himself.

788
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,760
呃，听着，奎恩先生，先生……
Uh, listen, Mr. Queen, sir...

789
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
你该走了。
You should go.

790
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,520
这东西知道我是谁
This thing knows who I am.

791
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,960
当然，它会来找我的。
Surely, it will come for me.

792
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,280
尽管我很喜欢你的陪伴，
Though I've enjoyed your company,

793
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,720
当它发生的时候，你最好不要在这里。
it's best you not be here when it does.

794
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,240
(门开了又关了)
(door opens, closes)

795
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
门..。
The door...

796
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,040
通向我们现实的大门。哪里?
The doorway to our reality. Where?

797
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,560
(不祥的声音)你怎么还没有意识到？
(ominous voice) How is it you do not yet realize?

798
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,600
尽管你曾经害怕过他们，
Though you once feared them,

799
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,280
只有蝙蝠知道拯救的路。
only the bats know the way to salvation.

800
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,800
你必须像我一样接受。
You must accept as I have.

801
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,040
只有他们才会说出来。
Only they will tell...

802
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
该死的!
Damn it!

803
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,880
我们没时间了！
We're running out of time!

804
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,040
你为什么不告诉我蝙蝠说了什么！
Why don't you tell me what the bats say!

805
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,040
你说他们跟你说话，对吧？
You said they speak to you, right?

806
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,600
他们包围着你。
They surround you.

807
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,880
你.。
You...

808
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,080
用蝙蝠包裹着的灵魂。
The spirit wrapped in bats.

809
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,640
韦恩先生。
Mr. Wayne.

810
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,840
是奥利弗。我觉得他..。
It's Oliver. I think he's...

811
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,120
他疯了。
Lost his mind.

812
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,480
艾尔弗雷德让我离你远点，因为你身体不舒服。但是..。
Alfred told me to leave you alone, because you weren't well. But...

813
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,320
天哪，他是不是挺得很便宜。
Golly, did he hold out cheap.

814
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,720
听着，先生。我不明白怎么回事，
Listen, sir. I don't understand what's going on,

815
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,600
但我能看出来情况很糟糕。
but I can tell it's bad.

816
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,160
真的很糟糕。
Real bad.

817
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,840
不管是什么..。
And whatever it is...

818
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,600
迪克和桑杰。
Dick and Sanjay...

819
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,000
现在，奥利弗出了点问题。
Now, something's wrong with Oliver.

820
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,320
他打扮得像个骑士，不停地说着即将到来的末日。
He's dressed as a knight and going on and on about a 'doom' that is coming.

821
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,920
(韦斯特博士)毒藤，丹特市长。
(Dr. West) Poison ivy, Mayor Dent.

822
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,760
(哈维)哦。现在过来。
(Harvey) Oh. Come now.

823
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,040
我好几个月没出过城了，韦斯特医生。
I haven't been out of the city in months, Dr. West.

824
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,440
那么，这就是压力。
Well, then, it's stress.

825
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,920
你这一周要求很高，哈维。
You have had a demanding week, Harv.

826
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,160
现在，找点时间放松一下。还有.。
Now, find some time to relax. And...

827
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,280
看在皮特的份上，伙计！别刮它！
For Pete's sake, man! Don't scratch it!

828
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,560
它只会被感染。
It'll just get infected.

829
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,320
这里。
Here.

830
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
用这个。
Use this.

831
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,280
(奥利弗)主啊，请赐予我力量来摧毁即将到来的事物。
(Oliver) Lord, grant me the strength to destroy the thing that is coming.

832
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,760
(脚步声走近)
(footsteps approaching)

833
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,400
噢。你好。
Oh. Hello.

834
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,520
怎么了，我们正谈到你呢。
Why, we were just talking about you.

835
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
(尖叫声)
(screeching)

836
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,080
(笑)谢天谢地！
(laughs) Thank goodness!

837
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,080
如果我这么容易就杀了你，就不会有体育比赛了。
If I'd killed you that easily, there'd have been no sport.

838
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
(咕噜声)
(grunts)

839
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,920
(大喊大叫)
(yelling)

840
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,760
(呻吟)
(groans)

841
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,120
(尖叫声)
(screeches)

842
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,040
(奥利弗咳嗽)
(Oliver coughing)

843
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
(呻吟)
(groans)

844
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,200
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

845
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
这套衣服不错。
Nice outfit.

846
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
你也是。
You, too.

847
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
(奥利弗)表演技巧。
(Oliver) Showmanship.

848
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,760
(呻吟)
(groans)

849
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,080
你看起来糟透了。
You look awful.

850
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,480
(大声叹息)
(groans loudly)

851
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
放松点，孩子。
Easy, kid.

852
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,520
在这点上，
At this point,

853
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,840
他们就是把我团结在一起的唯一力量。
they're all that's holding me together.

854
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,320
但好消息是..。
But good news...

855
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,960
而且没有使用圣塞巴斯蒂安的任何箭。
And without using any of St. Sebastian's arrows.

856
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,680
告诉过你没有动物能胜过我。
Told you no fauna could best me.

857
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,600
(虚弱地笑着)
(chuckles weakly)

858
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,560
李凯。
Kai Li.

859
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,320
给我们几分钟时间。
Give us a minute.

860
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,800
我以为我能阻止它，布鲁斯。
I thought I could stop it, Bruce.

861
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,120
这件事..。
This thing...

862
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,840
我以为我准备好了，但什么都准备不了...
Thought I was ready, but nothing could prepare...

863
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,320
我知道，奥利弗。比你想象的要多。
I know, Oliver. More than you realize.

864
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,880
布鲁斯。
Bruce...

865
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,280
一些我必须承认的事情。
Something I must confess...

866
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,280
这件事多年来一直压在我身上。
It's weighed on me for years.

867
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,920
老朋友，我的父亲。
Old friend, my father...

868
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,520
(叹息)
(sighs)

869
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,800
我很抱歉，布鲁斯，我父亲，他...
I'm so sorry, Bruce, my father, he...

870
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,280
做了他做过的事。
Did what he did.

871
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,800
你什么都没做，只是像个好人一样生活。
You did nothing but live as a good man.

872
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,360
这才是最重要的。
That's all that matters.

873
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,160
我希望你是对的，布鲁西。
I hope you're right, Brucey...

874
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,120
为我们双方着想。
For both our sake.

875
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,600
血统永远逃不过污点。
The bloodline can never escape the stain.

876
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,720
父亲的罪过。
The sins of the father.

877
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,080
(风哨声)
(wind whistles)

878
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,800
不管你是谁，请，
Whoever you are, please,

879
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,400
杀了我。
kill me.

880
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,080
(塔利亚)不要绝望。
(Talia) Do not despair.

881
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,160
末日就要到了。
The end is near.

882
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,080
但你还有更多的事要做。
But you have a little more to do.

883
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,280
(吱吱叫)
(cawing)

884
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,200
这不是你的错，韦恩先生。
It's not your fault, Mr. Wayne.

885
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,800
谈论死人，爬行动物瘟疫，植物怪物，这不是...
Talking dead folks, reptile plagues, plant monsters, it's not...

886
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,960
很自然。
natural.

887
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,120
没有人能预见到这一天的到来。
No one could have seen this coming.

888
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,600
我应该这么做的。
I should have.

889
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,800
迹象就在那里。
The signs were there.

890
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,040
我拒绝听他们的话，
I refused to heed them,

891
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,320
因为他们不符合我所认为的理性。
because they didn't align with what I deemed to be rational.

892
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,360
-这东西，它要来了，是吗？-很快.
- This thing, it is coming, huh? - Soon.

893
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,200
我不知道是怎么回事。
And I don't know how.

894
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,000
但只有我能阻止它。
But only I can stop it.

895
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,800
恕我直言，先生，奥利弗说了同样的话。
With all due respect, sir, Oliver said the same thing.

896
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,400
现在他死了。
And now he's dead.

897
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,360
他在试图做正确的事情时死了。
He died trying to do what was right.

898
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,120
他的死是因为他认为他父亲的疯狂是他欠世界的.
He died because he thought he owed the world for whatever insanity his dad...

899
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,960
-奥利弗相信父亲的罪过...-堆积在儿子身上。
- Oliver believed the sins of the father... - Are heaped upon the son.

900
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,840
嗯。我知道这一节。
Yeah. I know that verse.

901
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,080
但别忘了以西结18岁，
But don't forget Ezekiel 18,

902
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,935
‘儿子不愿分担父亲的罪过，
'The son will not share the guilt of the father,

903
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,840
父亲也不会分担儿子的罪责。
nor will the father share the guilt of the son.'

904
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,720
我的意思是，你没必要这么做。
My point is, you don't have to do this.

905
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,320
你可以走了。我们可以走了。
You can leave. We can leave.

906
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,640
买一艘新船，然后去其他任何地方。
Get a new ship and go anywhere else.

907
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,400
你不欠这座城市任何东西。
You don't owe this city anything.

908
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,440
大多数人，如果他们看到房子着火了，
Most people, if they see a house on fire,

909
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,760
一旦他们脱离危险就会跑去呼救。
would run and call for help once they're out of harm's way.

910
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,000
而其他人，很少有人，
While others, very few others,

911
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,920
会径直跑进那所房子
would run right into that house

912
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,120
并努力营救那些被困在里面的人。
and try to save those who are trapped inside.

913
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,240
当我找到你的那一刻，
The moment I found you,

914
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,880
我的每个直觉都告诉我你是那两个人中的哪一个。
my every instinct told me which one of those two people you were.

915
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,360
不管是不是厄运，李凯，
Doom or not, Kai Li,

916
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,160
哥谭市是一座着火的城市。
Gotham is a city on fire.

917
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,720
它需要那些愿意跑进地狱的人。
It needs those who are willing to run into the inferno.

918
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,480
布鲁斯·韦恩，你来了。
Bruce Wayne, there you are.

919
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,960
吉姆，你有什么要买的吗？
Was there something you wanted, Jim?

920
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,800
呃，没有。
Uh, no.

921
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,720
是的，事实上。
Yes, actually.

922
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,360
首先，对你的孩子们深表歉意。对此我深表哀悼。
First, deeply sorry about your boys. My condolences.

923
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,720
我向你保证我最好的人都在...
I assure you my best men are on the...

924
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,480
我是代表我女儿来的。
I'm here on behalf of my daughter.

925
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,640
芭芭拉？
Barbara?

926
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,440
她说她一直在找你。
She said she's been trying to reach you.

927
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,240
我相信你一定听说过她..。
I'm sure you've heard about her...

928
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,480
几年前的意外？是。
Accident a few years back? Yes.

929
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,960
可怜的家伙。她不再是以前的她了。
Poor thing. She hasn't been the same.

930
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,640
等一下。芭芭拉？
Wait a minute. Barbara?

931
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,880
芭芭拉·戈登？先知，对吧？
Barbara Gordon? The Oracle, right?

932
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,640
我在《幽灵月刊》上读到过她的故事！
I read about her in Spiritualism Monthly!

933
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,040
是的，我想芭芭拉已经养成了一种...
Yes, I suppose Barbara has developed something of a...

934
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,760
在某些圈子里的声誉。
reputation in certain circles.

935
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,800
她说她要和我谈谈？
And she says she needs to speak to me?

936
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,040
确切地说，不是她。
Not her, exactly.

937
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,080
-她的一个.-鬼魂。
- One of her... - Ghosts.

938
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,160
她说你会知道是谁。
She said you'd know who.

939
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,360
你是?
Do you?

940
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,880
我没有。
I don't.

941
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,520
布鲁斯，我知道这是个不寻常的要求。但它似乎..。
Bruce, I realize it's an unusual request. But it seemed...

942
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,480
对我的芭芭拉来说非常紧急，这会...
so very urgent to my Barbara, and it would...

943
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,520
-这对我来说意义重大。-告诉她我今晚会去看她
- It would mean a lot to me. - Tell her I'll see her tonight.

944
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,440
-好的.但探视时间是..。-今晚！
- Okay. But visiting hours are... - Tonight!

945
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,680
你认为先知知道如何阻止这件事吗？
Do you think the Oracle will know how to stop this thing?

946
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,920
不是先知，
Not the Oracle,

947
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,720
但精神包裹在火焰中。
but the spirit wrapped in flames.

948
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,040
是时候了。
It's time.

949
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,640
我不能让你离开。
I can't let you leave.

950
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,320
(布鲁斯)那不是你的决定。
(Bruce) That's not your decision.

951
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,080
你身体不太好。你这是怎么了？
You're not well. What's happening to you?

952
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,800
需要做的事。
What needs to happen.

953
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,240
我不能假装完全知道我将要面对的是什么。
I can't pretend to know exactly what I'm about to face.

954
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,560
但我知道我必须面对它。
But I do know that I must face it.

955
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,560
这就是我该做的事。
This is what I was meant to do.

956
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,080
-布鲁斯...-拜托，阿尔弗雷德.
- Bruce... - Please, Alfred.

957
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,040
我的时间不多了。
I haven't much time.

958
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,080
那好吧，布鲁斯少爷。
Very well then, Master Bruce.

959
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,560
如果时间很重要，就像你说的那样。
If time is of the essence, as you say...

960
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,680
我可以建议你开车去吗？
May I suggest taking the car?

961
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,640
你现在负责酒窖了。
You're in charge of the wine cellar now.

962
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,560
你不会回来了？
You're not coming back?

963
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,280
再见..。
Goodbye...

964
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,480
儿子。
Son.

965
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,840
再见，阿尔弗雷德。
Goodbye, Alfred.

966
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,520
我很高兴你接受了我的邀请。
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

967
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,840
尽管，我想，这应该让我担心
Although, I suppose, it should concern me

968
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,320
你这么容易就能闯入这个地方。
you're able to break into this place so easily.

969
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,240
(蝙蝠侠)无意冒犯，
(Batman) No offense,

970
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,240
但我想说更令人担忧的是雅克罕姆的能力
but I'd say the greater concern would be Arkham's ability

971
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,040
以防止这些病毒爆发。
to keep those from breaking out.

972
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,800
哦，这里没那么糟，布鲁斯。
Oh, it's not so bad in here, Bruce.

973
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,320
三个正方形。很好的伙伴。
Three squares. Good company.

974
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,240
完全没有来自所爱的人不必要的同情。
A complete absence of unnecessary pity from loved ones.

975
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,640
另外，如果你像我一样看的话，
Besides, if you saw as I do,

976
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,840
你会认为这些墙内的疯狂胜过外面真正的疯狂。
you'd take the insanity within these walls over the true madness out there.

977
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,160
也许你是对的。
Perhaps you're right.

978
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,920
那么，一只蝙蝠？哈。
So, a bat? Huh.

979
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,800
很有趣的生物，不是吗？
Interesting creatures, aren't they?

980
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:03,080
有趣的是，一只小小的有翼啮齿动物可以代表这么多不同的东西
Funny how one little winged rodent can mean so many different things

981
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,040
给这么多不同的人。
to so many different people.

982
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,000
如果你问我，
If you ask me,

983
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,120
这一切都与它们在黑暗中进行机动的神奇能力有关。
it's all about their uncanny ability to maneuver in the dark.

984
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,400
就像它们体现了一种对看不见的东西的感知。
Like they embody a perception of the things that can't be seen.

985
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,040
那么，让我来问你。
So, let me ask you.

986
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,200
他们对你意味着什么，布鲁斯？
What do they mean to you, Bruce?

987
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,800
为什么是蝙蝠？
Why a bat?

988
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:25,720
蝙蝠会激起恐惧，罪犯是迷信的。
Bats inspire fear, and criminals are superstitious and...

989
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,400
当然，很多人都很懦弱。
Cowardly lot, sure.

990
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,600
我就知道你会这么说。
I figured that's what you'd say.

991
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,640
但这真的是原因吗？
But is that really why?

992
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,880
好吧，我想是需要好好考虑一下的。
Well, something to think about, I guess.

993
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,160
好的，那就谈正事和你来的原因。
Okay then, down to business and the reason you've come.

994
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,320
你知道你需要和谁说话吗？
Do you know with whom you need to speak?

995
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,840
我想和包裹在火焰中的灵魂说话。
I wish to speak to the spirit wrapped in flames.

996
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,880
但你不知道这个灵魂是谁？
But you don't know who this spirit is?

997
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,760
只知道它在地狱里燃烧。
Only that it burns in hell.

998
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,400
你确定你想这么做吗？
And you're sure you want to do this?

999
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,280
这不是缺不缺的问题，芭芭拉。
It's not a question of want, Barbara.

1000
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,360
我们寻找的灵魂，我投降了。
Spirit we seek, I surrender myself.

1001
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,720
身体和灵魂，现在就到我们这里来吧。
Body and soul, come to us now.

1002
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,040
现在到我们这里来。
Come to us now.

1003
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,600
现在就到我们这里来！
Come to us now!

1004
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,240
父亲?
Father?

1005
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,360
这不可能。
It can't be.

1006
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,520
你好，布鲁斯。
Hello, Bruce.

1007
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
这是什么？
What is this?

1008
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,440
是我，儿子。
It's me, son.

1009
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,560
我真的非常非常抱歉。
And I am so, so sorry.

1010
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,240
相信我，我想在你长大后告诉你这件事。
Believe me, I wanted to tell you this when you were old enough.

1011
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,520
但不是像这样。
But not like this.

1012
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,120
这里不行。
Not here.

1013
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,720
告诉我什么？
Tell me what?

1014
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,400
我，托马斯·韦恩，生于1585年
I, Thomas Wayne, was born in 1585

1015
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,000
他是第一批到新大陆冒险的殖民者之一。
and was among the first colonists to venture to the new world.

1016
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,720
我和其他人建立了这个定居点，有一天它会成为哥谭市。
I and others founded the settlement that would one day become Gotham.

1017
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,680
罗，但最初的几年是不可饶恕的。
Lo, but those first years were unforgiving.

1018
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,120
这片土地贫瘠。冬天，确实很严酷。
The land penurious. The winters, harsh, indeed.

1019
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,720
我们快要死了。
We were dying.

1020
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:14,480
直到，我们中的一个人，奥斯瓦尔德·科布尔波特发现了被埋的东西
Until, one among us, Oswald Cobblepot discovered what was buried

1021
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,280
在我们土地下的土地下。
under the earth beneath our land.

1022
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,040
我自己，巴特利·朗斯特罗姆和亨利·奎恩
Myself, Bartly Langstrom, and Henry Queen

1023
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,120
跟着Cobblepot走进了一个邪恶的地方。
followed Cobblepot into an ungodly place.

1024
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,520
他给我们看了他在那里找到的那本古书。
He showed us the ancient book he'd found there.

1025
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,400
一本充满恶意的书。
A book steeped in malevolence.

1026
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:40,000
可以称之为绝望，可以称之为绝望，甚至可以称之为贪婪，
Call it despair, call it desperation, call it, perhaps, even greed,

1027
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,040
但我们四个从这本书中读到
but we four read from this book

1028
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,120
-并举行了最卑鄙的仪式。-(马嘶声)
- and performed its ceremonies most vile. - (horse neighing)

1029
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,680
它的耻辱将延续亿万年。
Shame of which would last eons.

1030
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,280
但是，唉，我们的定居点得救了。
But, alas, our settlement had been saved.

1031
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,560
甚至还很兴旺。
Flourished, even.

1032
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,760
不仅我们四个人取得了超乎我们想象的成功，
And not only did the four of us prosper beyond our wildest dreams,

1033
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,080
我们被赐予了明显的永生。
we'd been gifted apparent life eternal.

1034
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,520
随着时间的推移，我们几乎忘了这件事
In time, it was nearly as if we'd forgotten the events

1035
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,560
那个卑鄙的夜晚从未发生过。
of that despicable night ever occurred.

1036
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,040
然而，它并没有忘记我们。
It, however, did not forget us.

1037
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,960
几个世纪之后，
For centuries later,

1038
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:21,320
我们会知道，在那个宿命的夜晚，我们所忍受的恶毒唤醒了他。
we would learn that the malevolence we bore that fateful night awoke him.

1039
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,760
IOG Sotha。
Iog Sotha.

1040
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,440
这是我们的不幸
It was our wretchedness

1041
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,640
这将事情拉到了我们现实的门槛。
that drew the thing to the threshold of our reality.

1042
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,600
你.。
You...

1043
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,560
把他叫了出来。
called him forth.

1044
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,160
知道我们做了什么，真的做了，
Knowing what we'd done, truly done,

1045
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,160
驱使巴特利·朗斯特罗姆自杀，
drove Bartly Langstrom to suicide,

1046
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,600
奥斯瓦尔德·科布尔波特到了天涯海角，
Oswald Cobblepot to the ends of the earth,

1047
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,320
还有亨利·奎恩。
and Henry Queen to...

1048
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,840
(大喊大叫)
(yelling)

1049
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:51,400
嗯，最糟糕的是，诅咒让我们背负着消除恶行的重担
Well, worst yet, the curse lays the burden of undoing our misdeeds

1050
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,080
献给我们的孩子。
upon our children.

1051
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,120
父亲的罪加在儿子身上。
The sins of the father are heaped upon the son.

1052
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,440
是。
Yes.

1053
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,400
这就是为什么柯克·朗斯特罗姆和奥利弗都。
That's why Kirk Langstrom and Oliver both...

1054
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,920
但现在还不算太晚，孩子。
But it's not too late, son.

1055
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,400
你可以阻止这件事。
You can stop this thing.

1056
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,920
IOG Sotha还没有进入我们的领域。
Iog Sotha has not yet entered our realm.

1057
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,000
你必须在门完全打开之前找到它。
You must find the door before it fully opens.

1058
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,240
多么?
How?

1059
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,520
通过成为你真正的自己。
By becoming what you truly are.

1060
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,360
来看我，
In coming to see me,

1061
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:22,440
你已经接受了一个超越理性和科学的世界。
you've accepted a world beyond reason and science.

1062
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,480
但你必须接受它。
But you must embrace it.

1063
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,160
你必须寻求圣餐。
You must seek communion...

1064
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,200
和他们在一起。
With them.

1065
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,560
蝙蝠。
The bats.

1066
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,360
谢谢你，芭芭拉
Thank you, Barbara.

1067
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,880
谢谢。
Thank you.

1068
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,280
(蝙蝠侠念咒语)
(Batman chanting incantation)

1069
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,240
(不祥的声音)你回来了。
(ominous voice) You have returned.

1070
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,360
是Iog-Sotha的时候了。
It is time for Iog-Sotha.

1071
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,680
只有蝙蝠才能面对他。
Only the bat can face him.

1072
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,800
你现在明白这意味着什么了，对吧？
You understand what that means now, yes?

1073
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,440
我知道。终于来了。
I do. At last.

1074
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,040
你准备好接受这次牺牲了吗？
Y ou are prepared for this sacrifice?

1075
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,600
我是。
I am.

1076
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,920
那么现在，你是我们中的一员了。
Then now, you are one of us.

1077
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,920
告诉我在哪里能找到那玩意儿。
Just tell me where to find the thing.

1078
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,360
一切开始的地方。
Where it began.

1079
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,800
(硬币叮当作响)
(coin clinking)

1080
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,880
哈维..。
Harvey...

1081
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,480
有人告诉我，毒藤。
Poison Ivy, I'm told.

1082
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,000
正在考虑另一种意见。
Considering a second opinion.

1083
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,800
布鲁斯？
Bruce?

1084
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,680
你要照顾好自己。
You take care of yourself.

1085
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,120
哈?
Huh?

1086
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,360
你也是，哈维。
You too, Harv.

1087
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,520
我很快就会见到你的。
I'll see you soon.

1088
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,960
(咕哝着)
(grunting)

1089
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,720
(咕噜声)
(grunts)

1090
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,080
(咆哮)
(roars)

1091
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,920
原谅我，孩子们。
Forgive me, boys.

1092
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,320
(大喊大叫)
(yelling)

1093
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,360
(咆哮)
(growls)

1094
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,480
(咕噜声)
(grunts)

1095
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,040
感谢上帝。
Thank God.

1096
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,600
揍他们一顿，布鲁斯。
Kick their ass, Bruce.

1097
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,080
(Ra‘s al Ghul念咒语)
(Ra's al Ghul chanting incantation)

1098
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,680
IOG Sotha，
Iog Sotha,

1099
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,400
我感受到了你的力量。
I feel your power.

1100
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,080
是!
Yes!

1101
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
(塔莉亚喊道)
(Talia yells)

1102
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,360
(呻吟)
(groans)

1103
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
(两人都在咕哝)
(both grunting)

1104
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,800
我宁愿认为，在不同的情况下，
I'd rather like to think that under different circumstances,

1105
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,360
我们会成为盟友..。
we'd be allies...

1106
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,320
也许是朋友。
Friends, perhaps.

1107
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,680
(哽咽)
(choking)

1108
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,240
(尖叫声)
(screams)

1109
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,200
(塔莉亚虚弱地呻吟)
(Talia groans weakly)

1110
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,440
我的朋友有一个死的坏习惯。
My friends have a bad habit of dying.

1111
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,400
现在只剩下你和我了。
It's just you and me now.

1112
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,920
(呻吟)
(groans)

1113
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,240
混帐。
You fool.

1114
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,720
这件事..。
This thing...

1115
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,280
这件事超出了你人类的理解。
This thing is beyond your human comprehension.

1116
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,680
看啊。
Behold.

1117
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:42,640
因为即使是凝视它也会招致疯狂！
For even to gaze upon it is to incur madness!

1118
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,680
我看过了。
I've seen it.

1119
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,840
你还不明白吗？
Do you not see?

1120
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,560
事情已经做完了。
The deed is done.

1121
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,640
我就是他。
I am him.

1122
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,120
诞生于无名的迷雾中，
Born of the nameless mist,

1123
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,440
伊布·诺格罗斯的祖先，
progenitor of Yib Nogeroth,

1124
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,800
难以形容的哈斯托..。
Hastur the unspeakable...

1125
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,560
还有克苏鲁本人！
And Cthulhu himself!

1126
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,240
(咕噜声)
(grunts)

1127
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,000
去死吧！
Die!

1128
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:43,360
因为很快所有活着的人都将跟随你进入地狱！
For soon all that lives shall follow thee into Hell!

1129
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,440
(尖叫声)
(screaming)

1130
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,120
人类将从地球上被抹去！
Humanity shall be wiped from the earth!

1131
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,160
(女)那是什么？
(woman) What is that?

1132
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,800
(尖叫声)
(screaming)

1133
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,120
(血液)在这场比赛中占上风，
(Blood) To prevail in this,

1134
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,240
布鲁斯·韦恩必须死，并在死后成为他自己。
Bruce Wayne must die and through death become himself.

1135
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,480
(奥利弗)血统永远无法逃脱罪恶的污点。
(Oliver) The bloodline can never escape the stain of sin...

1136
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,080
(芭芭拉)为什么是蝙蝠？
(Barbara) Why a bat?

1137
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,280
(不祥的声音)蝙蝠知道拯救的路。
(ominous voice) The bats know the way to salvation.

1138
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,720
(托马斯)你必须接受它。
(Thomas) You must embrace it.

1139
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,800
(不祥的声音)现在！你现在是我们中的一员了。
(ominous voice) Now! You are now one of us.

1140
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,120
你还活着？
You're still alive?

1141
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,360
(咆哮)
(roaring)

1142
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,080
不是活着的。
Not alive.

1143
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,200
现在不是了。
Not anymore.

1144
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,600
你是干什么的？
What are you?

1145
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,280
我是蝙蝠侠！
I am Batman!

1146
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,600
(尖叫声)
(screaming)

1147
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,280
是!
Yes!

1148
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,040
(咆哮)
(snarls)

1149
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,880
(高音嗡嗡声)
(high-pitched droning)

1150
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,960
(呻吟)
(groaning)

1151
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,440
(尖叫声)
(screaming)

1152
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,840
埃特里根..。
Etrigan...

1153
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:12,960
(咕哝着)
(grunting)

1154
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,520
9~10成熟。账本清清楚楚。
Well done. The ledger is clear.

1155
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,560
现在你走吧，而我在这里做我的破坏。
Now take your leave, whilst I do my damage here.

1156
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,720
(血)你必须找出两个灵魂。
(Blood) You must seek out two spirits.

1157
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,920
一个被蝙蝠包裹着，另一个被火焰包裹着。
One wrapped in bats, the other in flames.

1158
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,720
要为你的黑暗统治付出代价
A price is to be paid for your dark reign

1159
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,240
因此，你将永远留在这个地狱里！
and so here for eternity in this hell you remain!

1160
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,320
(血)布鲁斯·韦恩必须死，
(Blood) Bruce Wayne must die,

1161
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,920
通过死亡，成为他自己。
and through death, become himself.

1162
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,240
在它被真正拯救之前，
Before it can be truly saved,

1163
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,520
哥谭市必须被夷为平地。
Gotham must be burned to the ground.

1164
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,360
(人们尖叫)
(people screaming)

1165
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,360
(气喘吁吁)
(panting)

1166
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,640
(卢修斯)尽管这场灾难几个月前才发生，
(Lucius) Though this disaster struck only months ago,

1167
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,600
布鲁斯·韦恩纪念基金会已经开始重建。
the Bruce Wayne memorial foundation has already begun to rebuild.

1168
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,800
一个更好的哥谭市近在咫尺。
A better Gotham is in reach.

1169
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:21,000
我们想把这一努力献给韦恩先生的两个好朋友，
And we'd like to dedicate this effort to two dear friends of Mr. Wayne,

1170
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,480
以及哥谭市本身。
and of Gotham itself.

1171
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,360
尊敬的哈维·登特和奥利弗·奎恩先生。
The honorable Harvey Dent and Mr. Oliver Queen.

1172
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,520
(人们鼓掌)
(people clapping)

1173
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,400
而现在，
And now,

1174
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,560
基金会的代理负责人，
the acting head of the foundation,

1175
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,560
李凯女士。
Ms. Kai Li Cain.

1176
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,920
我来的时间不长，
I've not been here long,

1177
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:55,040
但多亏了布鲁斯，我开始把高谭市当成自己的家。
but thanks to Bruce, I've come to think of Gotham as home.

1178
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,880
在很多方面，我的第一个家。
In many ways, my first home.

1179
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,800
布鲁斯·韦恩对高谭市的未来充满了憧憬。
Bruce Wayne had a vision of what Gotham could be.

1180
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,480
一个理想。
An ideal.

1181
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,400
我保证会尽我所能，
I promise to do everything within my power,

1182
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,640
在我的能力范围之外，
and beyond my power,

1183
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:12,000
实现布鲁斯·韦恩的梦想
to bring about the realization of Bruce Wayne's dream

1184
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,480
为了一个新的哥谭市。
for a new Gotham City.

1185
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,760
说到布鲁斯
Speaking of Bruce,

1186
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,480
对于你们当中认识并爱他的人来说，
for those of you who knew and loved him,

1187
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,400
在这个最后的想法中得到安慰。
take comfort in this final thought.

1188
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,400
他并不总是最坦率的人，
He wasn't always the most forthcoming man,

1189
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,600
但你总是可以肯定两件事。
but you could always be sure of two things.

1190
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,000
他愿意为他所爱的人做任何事，
He would do anything for those that he loved,

1191
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,280
他像地狱一样顽固。
and he was stubborn as hell.

1192
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,120
我知道布鲁斯在看着我们。
I know Bruce is watching over us.

1193
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,480
我有种感觉，如果我们，
And something tells me that if we,

1194
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,360
他所珍视的人民和城市曾经需要他，
the people and city that he held so dear, ever needed him,

1195
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,760
真的很需要他，
really needed him,

1196
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,560
即使是死亡本身也不能让他远离。
not even death itself could keep him away.
