1
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,600
I think your bookkeeper
paid for the flatware twice.

2
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,770
Albert, stop.
I can't do this any more.

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,710
Mollie, I love you and
you love me.

4
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:54,417
Albert, you're great in bed
and you're my biggest account.

5
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,882
...but you're married!

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:03,220
And I'll never fall
in love with anyone else
while I'm seeing you.

7
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,331
You know I'm leaving Beth.
It just takes time.

8
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:13,795
Every time I say the
word divorce, she loses
five pounds.

9
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:18,137
I'm sorry she's bulimic.

10
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:22,636
- I can't wait for you forever
- It's going to work out soon.

11
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,820
The doctor prescribed
new pills and she's
starting ballet classes.

12
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:36,157
- It'll be like the
playwriting.

13
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,694
- She knows this can't
make her fat. She said writing
made her ass spread.

14
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,500
Which is insane, she's got
a great ass for a 40-year-old.

15
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:48,735
I'll tell Mr. Ross to give
your account to someone else.

16
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:55,412
I won't let him.
I'll never let anyone
else touch my books.

17
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:06,047
God, Mollie, I'm going
to burst if you don't
kiss me soon.

18
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:50,034
Follow me. I know where
I'm going. I've got the map.
Come on.

19
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:55,937
Come on, keep up, you kids.
Here we go.

20
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:04,078
Wait a minute, I see something

21
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,624
I think this is it,
right over here.

22
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:12,121
This is definitely it.
This is the place.

23
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,785
Jackpot!

24
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:19,985
Right down here, kids.
Here we go.

25
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,900
Dig in, you kids. Here we go.

26
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,238
It's kind of tough here.

27
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,505
Oh, oh...

28
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,477
I'm in!

29
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:12,876
Are you okay?

30
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:16,216
- I broke up with George.
- Who?

31
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:23,793
George. I met him in
Joe Allen's. He turned out
to be stupid.

32
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:33,973
You look lousy, doll.

33
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:39,974
- Stomach flu. It's
going around.
- Nobody has the stomach flu.

34
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,840
They don't?
You want to hear about Albert?

35
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:47,621
- Listen to me.
- I am.

36
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:53,521
Albert's shrink said
his wife would never recover
if he kept seeing me.

37
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:57,987
- He's decided to leave her.
- Albert's leaving his wife?

38
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:04,828
No, he's leaving his shrink.
She was really an obstacle
between us.

39
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,968
Leaving his shrink?
He's supposed to leave
his wife.

40
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:16,236
He's going to. He can't
leave her while she's sick.
She's bulimic.

41
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,909
Don't give me that look.
It's a very serious disease.

42
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:57,077
What in the... Wait a minute.

43
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,490
I've got two of these things.
Look at that, they match.

44
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:08,126
- You ate all that already?
- How weird, I don't like
ice cream.

45
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:12,525
- There he is.
- This is sick.

46
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,170
He looks so sweet
with the kids. If only Beth
would stop throwing up.

47
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:23,077
Miss Popularity, you can't
expect to find a husband if
you never go out.

48
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:27,783
- You're in every night
of the week.
- Ma, it's tax season.

49
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,050
I was studying to pass
a CPA exam..

50
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,730
- and I still managed
to catch your father.

51
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,729
What if Daddy was married
when you first met him?

52
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,226
- I wouldn't have fallen
for him.
- You can't control that.

53
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:51,039
Why not?
Listen, take your father here.

54
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:56,084
His favourite food was
cheesecake, and what
did the doctor tell him?

55
00:07:56,143 --> 00:08:01,353
- "Cut back on cholesterol."
- Now he doesn't eat
cheesecake.

56
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,992
Ma, that doesn't make
any sense.

57
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:10,193
You never used to like my food
Something's wrong.

58
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,557
- Nothing's wrong.
- Louie, something's wrong.

59
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:17,397
- I didn't eat breakfast.
- Something's wrong.

60
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,440
No.

61
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,082
Oh, no!

62
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,954
- Yes!
- Oh, no!

63
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:40,545
- This wasn't a planned
pregnancy?

64
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,931
- This wasn't even
a planned affair. Well..Iet's
see how far along we are

65
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:56,999
Time out! Holy cow,
what was that? Who's that?

66
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,810
How could this have happened?

67
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:04,443
- How old are you now, Mollie?
- 33.

68
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,621
Remember,
your biological clock
is ticking.

69
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:24,556
Beth finally agreed to
a divorce. Mollie, I'm so
glad you waited

70
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:29,602
I knew if I was patient,
this day would come.

71
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,507
Remember your
biological clock.

72
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,566
My biological
clock is ticking...

73
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,273
I know, I've already said that
I didn't plan on this.

74
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,205
I'm not asking for anything.
I don't want to trap you.

75
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:11,813
But this baby... it's you and
me, and I'm not getting
an abortion.

76
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:19,254
I wasn't going to ask you to.
This will be an
incredible baby.

77
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:24,829
He'll have your sweet face
and my business sense.

78
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:29,102
- We'll get little
Armani diapers.
- It will be a great kid.

79
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:33,202
Having my baby
what a way to say you love me

80
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:37,706
Albert, you're making me sick.
I hate that song.

81
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:43,777
Stop singing.
She gets sick, I get sick.

82
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:47,384
What are you going
to tell people?

83
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,447
That I got artificially
inseminated.

84
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:56,087
What?
How could you do such a thing?

85
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,286
I went to the clinic
and bought some frozen sperm.

86
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,270
- I inserted it, now
I'm pregnant.
- Where's the frozen pop?

87
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:11,913
- There's no frozen pop.
- There's no husband.

88
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,481
I control my life
and I want to have a baby.

89
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:21,114
This kind of thing a girl does
if she's very ugly
or a lesbian.

90
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,721
This is not the act
of a beautiful
intelligent girl.

91
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:30,156
You never liked
any of my boyfriends, anyway.

92
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:35,003
- Where did this sperm
come from?
- A medical student.

93
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,265
He goes to Columbia.
His parents live on the lsland

94
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:44,673
His father's in piece goods.
His mother works in cosmetics.

95
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:48,478
So you're making fun of me.
Wait, you'll see.

96
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,111
Someday you'll have children.

97
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:10,833
Look... an arm. It's an arm.

98
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:16,738
Look... isn't it cute?

99
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,827
Here's the head... isn't it?

100
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,041
Get some apple
juice down here!

101
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,317
- Thirsty?
- Go ahead.

102
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,558
"The sex organs are moulded
out of similar tissue folds."

103
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,695
"By the second trimester
they are identifiable."

104
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,373
Look, another arm
coming in down there...

105
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:24,703
How am I going to get that
in my mouth?

106
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:30,737
Miss, excuse me...

107
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:36,252
- What can I do for you?
- Albert is expecting me.

108
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:42,016
He's in with his decorator.
You can wait over there.

109
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:51,561
- I think you're going
to enjoy it.
- I'm sure I will.

110
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:55,471
- Remember to dust
it every day.
- See you later.

111
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,935
Hi, come on in.

112
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:12,246
Albert, was that woman pretty?

113
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:17,089
- No, you're pretty.
- I look like a big,
fat pilgrim.

114
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,602
How do you like the desk?

115
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:26,702
- It's made of stone.
- It's all right.

116
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:31,236
It's going to be great in here
This is all going.

117
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:36,844
I'm having a custom-made mural
of an ancient Navajo design.

118
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,510
Leather craftsmen in Mexico
are going to make
all new couches.

119
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:47,322
- What do you think?
- I like the deco stuff.

120
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:52,587
- Don't gain too much weight.
- My doctor says
my weight is fine.

121
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:59,369
Beth only gained 21 pounds.
She jogged three miles a day.

122
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:04,242
- Maybe you should marry her.
- Don't start.

123
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:10,384
- I've got problems, too.
- Sorry. I'm afraid
of giving birth.

124
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,613
- I've never been real
big on pain.
- You been to Lamaze?

125
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:18,221
I quit.
It's just a bunch
of breathing.

126
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,523
It's so much better
for the baby.
When Beth had Priscilla...

127
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,560
I'm so sick of hearing
about Beth!

128
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:31,897
How could you be in
love with her and then
in love with me?

129
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,295
I have a degree.
She took belly-dancing lessons

130
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,268
When I found out I
was pregnant,
I decided to make out a will.

131
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:46,451
When Beth had the girls,
she had a reading
of their past lives.

132
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:53,253
- And you're still with her!
- Oh yeah? Look
at this receipt.

133
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,260
- Galleria Apartments.
- I moved out. I did it.

134
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,364
I put down a deposit
this morning.

135
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,899
I can't believe it!
Should I come by tonight?

136
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,695
You'd better not.
We've still got to be careful.

137
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:15,137
Albert, I'm so happy!

138
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:23,720
I wonder if this store
has a bathroom.
I have to go again.

139
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:30,615
I love this... Look,
it takes two of them
to cover me.

140
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,690
- Yeah, but you're having
a baby.
- You try it on.

141
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:39,201
- Should I have a baby
with Neal?
- Do you love him?

142
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:42,066
No.

143
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:47,705
Try some of that
Nobel Prize winners' sperm.

144
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,740
Don't you want a smart baby?

145
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:57,681
That's all I need. A baby
telling me what an idiot I am.

146
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,360
- I found a nice family man.
- Except it's someone
else's family.

147
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:08,803
That's why he left.
He loves me and we're
having baby.

148
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:13,871
It sounds like the people
in the next compartment are.

149
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:29,075
- Mollie!
- Albert!

150
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:34,519
- Let me explain...
- These dresses
aren't paid for.

151
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:39,757
- Don't take this
shit from him.
- I'm going to call the cops.

152
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,496
After you. Thank you.

153
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,772
- Albert, what's going on?
- Mollie, I've fallen in love.

154
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,643
Beth knows.
I'm going to live
with Melissa.

155
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:56,183
I don't know if it'll last.
It just happened.

156
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:59,483
Why didn't you
say anything to me?

157
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:03,446
You were so close
to the end of your pregnancy.

158
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,286
I don't believe this
is happening.

159
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:10,693
This sounds awful, but
I'm going through a
selfish phase.

160
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:16,259
- A selfish phase?
- I admit the timing is bad.

161
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:20,369
- A selfish phase?
- It just happened.

162
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,603
A selfish phase!
Albert, you dick.

163
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:29,641
- You lousy prick!
- Leave him alone.

164
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,409
- Come on.
- Here.

165
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,050
Hey, what the...

166
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:42,046
- Wait, please, I'm in labour.
- I was here first.

167
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:48,156
Asshole! Taxi! Please...

168
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,100
St. Jerome's Hospital.

169
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,414
Oh, shit!

170
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:11,645
- Slow down! It can take hours
- So can the midtown traffic.

171
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,802
Pull over till the ludes
wear off.

172
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,698
God, you idiot!

173
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:35,341
Come on, move it.

174
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:46,019
Christ, this traffic...
We're going as fast as we can.

175
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:52,155
Hold onto my hand. Bear down,
that's what they
say in the hospital.

176
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:56,855
- Come on, move it.
- God, my water just broke.

177
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:02,299
- Hey, buddy, move it.
- You can't get through here.

178
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:06,569
- I've got an emergency.
- Sorry, buddy, move it.

179
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:15,077
Just relax.
Hold on, we're almost there.

180
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,317
Look out! You're going to hit.

181
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,632
Hold on!

182
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,404
You stupid son of a..!

183
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,801
- Are you doing your Lamaze?
- Look out!

184
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,577
- Breathe deep.
- Don't try to help,
just drive!

185
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,675
You've got to use Lamaze.
My sister-in-law used it.

186
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,949
- It's better for the kid.
- All men are stupid idiots.

187
00:20:55,555 --> 00:21:00,385
- Should I call your husband?
- I don't have a husband.

188
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,399
- I was artificially
inseminated.
- Are you a lesbo?

189
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:28,689
Stupid jerk! My kid
will probably be brain
damaged because of you.

190
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,760
Don't touch me! I'll
have this baby without
you touching me.

191
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:42,537
- Excuse me, I'm in labour.
- Do you have your
medical card?

192
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:45,772
- I left it at home.
- I have to have your
medical card.

193
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:50,978
- This is my first baby.
- She's getting close.
Upstairs.

194
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:55,883
You didn't finish this.
I cannot do my job...

195
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,690
- Put these on over
your clothes.
- I'm not the father.

196
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:09,696
- Nurse, another one's coming.
- Deep breaths, come on.

197
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:12,972
Okay, this'll pass.
Watch the head.

198
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:18,373
God! I need some drugs.

199
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:22,838
- Slow down your breathing.
- Fuck my breathing!

200
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:28,309
- You've got to calm down.
- Get me some drugs.

201
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:33,191
- No, you don't want drugs.
- I do. I'm going
to split in two.

202
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:37,662
By the time they
take effect she could
be delivering.

203
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:42,634
- But what about now?
- I'm waiting for a doctor.

204
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:49,344
Are you a doctor? Come on.

205
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:55,838
- Water break?
- Half an hour ago.

206
00:22:55,908 --> 00:23:01,248
- Are we doing our Lamaze
breathing?
- I dropped out of Lamaze.

207
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:05,893
I'll go to summer school
if you make the pain stop.

208
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:10,562
- How about some Demerol?
- God, that'd be great!

209
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:15,533
I'd like some of that.
Give me a lot of it.

210
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:18,925
So it doesn't wear off
during the birth.

211
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:24,898
I think maybe I'm in a
bit more pain than most
of your patients.

212
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,371
Be sure and give me enough.

213
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:33,681
- There we go.
- Thank you a really lot.

214
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:40,823
That is a little more like it.

215
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:44,717
Hey, here's Mr. Hand here.

216
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:51,095
Now that is very cosmic.
I don't understand...

217
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:55,603
What's that light down there?

218
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,509
That's it, breathe!

219
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:05,243
Attagirl, push. One more.

220
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:09,351
Stop with that pushing!
I'm falling!

221
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,894
Help!

222
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:22,926
No, put me back in! Let go
of my head and put
me back inside!

223
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,095
It's a boy.

224
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:28,074
It's a boy.

225
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:33,274
Who are you?
Lady, I'm freezing.
I'm so cold.

226
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:36,979
Get that thing away from me.

227
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:41,153
- You want to do the cord?
- No, you take this one.

228
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,453
I need that!

229
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:51,319
Lady, a blanket,
something,
I'm frosty out here.

230
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:57,833
No, don't do that!

231
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:06,207
Where are we going now?
Hey, don't drop me.

232
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:11,042
Oh, very nice...

233
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,987
I don't know about you,
but I'm beat.

234
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:25,794
So you're the one
that's been kicking me.

235
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,328
You're the one
that ate the spicy food.

236
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:37,441
This is the weirdest
thing that's ever happened
to me... so far.

237
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:46,252
I don't get it. I just don't
get it. Where did I go wrong?

238
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:53,090
Where are my thumbs?
I want to suck my thumbs.

239
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:58,662
- I have to get my own place.
- I've been reincarnated
so quickly?

240
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:03,026
What a surprise!

241
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:07,795
Who stole my sucking thing?
I need my sucking thing!

242
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:10,937
I just remembered
I hate childhood.

243
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:23,379
Look at all those daddies.

244
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:30,089
Making goofball faces
and taking pictures
of their babies.

245
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:33,256
You won't find your
father here.

246
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:37,095
I really messed things
up for you.

247
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:42,333
Don't be upset.
I'm going to find you a daddy.

248
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:46,311
And not just some handsome guy
I'm in love with.

249
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:53,382
You're all that matters to me.
I'll get you the best
daddy ever.

250
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:05,785
Out, down, in, out...
Well, we got that.

251
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,228
What have you got there?
A hand?

252
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,225
Yeah, two of them.

253
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,839
Oh, my God!

254
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:34,245
"On the third or fourth day
your breasts may
swell slightly."

255
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,790
Slightly?
I look like a Russ
Meyer movie.

256
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,695
Workman.

257
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:53,638
- Oh, no! Sorry.
- Real nice.

258
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:01,512
- You got your figure back.
- This is not my figure.

259
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,720
Sorry I hit you and
yelled at you, but I was
in a lot of pain.

260
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:11,715
I still owe you that cab fare,
but somebody stole my purse.

261
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:16,201
- How do you like New
York so far?
- It's my kind of town.

262
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:21,932
I'll get you the rest later...
Wait a minute...

263
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:27,211
- How did you know where
I lived?
- You left it in the cab.

264
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,682
Thanks.

265
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:36,684
You should look through
that thing. You've still
got your diaphragm.

266
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:46,029
Don't smoke that around
my baby.

267
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:51,362
There's a 62 * higher
rate of cancer in people
who live with smokers.

268
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:56,670
What are you trying to say?
You don't want me to
move in yet?

269
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:01,235
Do you think the drugs
had any effect on him?

270
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:05,577
- How did you know
I had drugs?
- I don't. I didn't.

271
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,854
You can tell in his eyes.
He looks stoned.

272
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:17,422
- He does not. He
looks perfect.

273
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,359
- You don't look so
hot yourself.

274
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,496
If you tried passing a
watermelon, how hot
would you look?

275
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:27,872
Ouch! I should call
my mother more often. Get it?

276
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:32,744
- Do you want a sub?
- No, will you just watch him?

277
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:38,035
Don't take him out of
his chair and don't touch
him a whole lot.

278
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,316
Hi, Mikey. I'm James.

279
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:49,492
- Good to meet you.
- Do you mind if I
suck on that?

280
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:56,155
- How long have you been here?
- About five years.

281
00:29:56,228 --> 00:30:04,038
- Were you born in New York?
- Are you with the
census bureau?

282
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:11,183
How do you like the
outside world?
It's weird, isn't it?

283
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:17,083
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Here, your first
lesson in coffee.

284
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:22,649
- Can you say black coffee?
- No.

285
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:28,091
Regular coffee has
two sugars and milk...
which they have forgotten.

286
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:35,130
Can I borrow some of yours?
Coffee regular, I love it.

287
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:38,541
That's breast milk.

288
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:44,913
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You're on your own.

289
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:48,007
I'll see you guys later.

290
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm going to take my sub and
my breast milk and
get out of here.

291
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:58,686
I've got something
cold and wet in my shorts.

292
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:03,627
Could you get somebody for me?
Fellas?

293
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:09,965
You guys are no help.
I'm cold and wet and there's
nothing I can do.

294
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:14,806
It's okay, Mikey.
Mommy's here.

295
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:22,306
That Mommy person's here again
She's okay. I like her.

296
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:30,224
I start crying
and she comes in with a bottle

297
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:33,289
Crying, I can handle that.

298
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,466
Taxi!

299
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:23,676
Taxi!

300
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:51,742
"80 * of all women experience
post-partum depression."

301
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,773
I won't.

302
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:02,678
Like a lot of parents, I can't
always be there on birthdays.

303
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:08,648
Help, somebody burp me
before I blow up.

304
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:16,830
That's it! You have
some exotic disease and
I look like a zombie.

305
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:22,025
And your father deserted
us so he could pork his
interior decorator.

306
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:26,241
I think you can safely say
that it can't get any worse.

307
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:31,075
- Hello!
- I was wrong.

308
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:36,083
Where's my grandson?

309
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:38,578
There he is.

310
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,260
- Mikey, do you know who I am?
- No, actually, I don't.

311
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:52,056
- I'm your grandma.
- Okay, if you say so.

312
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:55,501
- Yes, I am.
- What do you want from me?

313
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:04,011
- Who's got a wet tushy?
- I give up.

314
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,980
After a new diaper, I like
some of that white stuff on me

315
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:18,021
If you had a man instead
of a frozen pop, all this
would be put together.

316
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:23,130
You make it sound like I had
an affair with a frozen
dessert.

317
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:26,965
- You look awful.
- Thank you.

318
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:30,142
You're using too much powder.

319
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:36,382
Why don't you get out
of the house? I'm going
to give Mikey a bath

320
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,912
A what?

321
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,822
She's gone!

322
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,359
Who would you want
as your child's father?

323
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,099
Someone with a small mouth
and good hair...

324
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:07,507
- A guy to help raise
your child.
- Are there men who do that?

325
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:12,283
I'm looking for a guy
who's not married, -

326
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:17,324
- not into drugs,
not a deadbeat,
but not a workaholic.

327
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:23,523
- And cute.
- Cute is of no importance.

328
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:26,289
You're my first date
since my baby was born.

329
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:31,596
This looks delicious.

330
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:36,803
What is this?
I asked for well done.
This is raw.

331
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,968
I asked for no dressing,
this is covered with slop.

332
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,849
Are you deaf or something?
Who do I have to kill
to get a roll?

333
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:53,752
What's this "C" in algebra?
How many times did
we go over it?

334
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,364
Are you an idiot?

335
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:04,334
Dating is difficult, but
you've got to take a
chance in life sometime.

336
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:08,426
I'm not so sure about that.
Excuse me.

337
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,470
This fork and this
plate are dirty, and there's
something in the water.

338
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,484
Check your water.

339
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:24,954
Mikey, what is this mess?
Sort out these socks.

340
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,386
Why are school shirts
mixed up with after-
school shirts?

341
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:32,215
Straighten this up properly.

342
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:42,125
- Hi.
- Hey.

343
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,940
- Somebody call for a cab?
- Yeah, small world.

344
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:51,305
More mail for Vincent Ubriacco
I don't even know this guy.

345
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:57,717
Let me have them. Put them
up here, the postman will
take care of them.

346
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:04,063
- It's good seeing you again.
- You, too. See you.

347
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:12,229
- You're stealing my mail!
- I'm not stealing your mail.

348
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:16,098
- You put it in your pocket!
- These are mine.

349
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:21,407
- I sent them here.
I'll explain.
- I'm going to call the police

350
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:25,543
My grandfather Vincent
needs an old-age home -

351
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:31,621
- and there's a place in
Manhattan, but he
needs to be a resident.

352
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,753
You want to use my
mailing address?

353
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,490
I could have you arrested.
Screwing with the mail is
a federal offence.

354
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,159
Stealing mail is,
not screwing with it.

355
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,600
- Can I get the other letters?
- No, I don't want to
get involved.

356
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:55,369
I went out of my way
to bring you back your purse.

357
00:37:55,441 --> 00:38:00,781
Thank you very much,
but this happens to be illegal

358
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:05,946
You're not going to get caught
I'll do something
for you, okay.

359
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:10,957
- I'll baby-sit.
- Come on...

360
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:16,062
- You don't know about babies.
- My sister has kids.

361
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:20,797
- I know a lot about babies.
- All right, Friday night.

362
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:27,006
- No can do, Friday's out.
- Then forget the whole deal.

363
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:32,542
- Okay, Friday, but that's it.
- And during my
aerobics classes.

364
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:35,851
- One aerobics class.
- Saturday.

365
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,354
Can't do. I teach.

366
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,687
What do you teach?
Taxi driver's ed?

367
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:46,323
- That's not funny.
- Here's the deal.

368
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:51,702
Friday nights, two aerobics
classes, and you can't
bring chicks over.

369
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:56,943
You're pushing it.
All right, it's a deal.

370
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,972
- Sucker.
- Good.

371
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:04,278
- don't force-feed him
like that.
- i'm not!

372
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:09,582
- Why don't you take a nap?
- He doesn't need a nap.

373
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:14,088
- He knows when he's tired.
- I'm not tired at all.

374
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,934
If he doesn't take a nap -

375
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:24,131
- he will wake up and want
to eat when it's time to sleep

376
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,495
- Who says?
- All those doctors.

377
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:33,337
- They just want to sell books
- Dr. Spock is not like that.

378
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:38,335
Dr. Spock loves us.
He protested during
the Vietnam war.

379
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,550
I'm sorry I said anything
about Dr. Spock.

380
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:47,054
I can't believe she's getting
upset about a Vulcan.

381
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:55,394
- Have you got any
other letters?
- They're in the hallway.

382
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,913
Mommy's asleep. Watch this.

383
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:46,412
What do you say you
and me take a ride so
your mother can sleep?

384
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:51,648
- Is that a deal?
- Just bring the milk.

385
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:55,847
See that? That's my cab.

386
00:40:55,921 --> 00:41:00,431
I do this to make money,
but not for long.

387
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:08,199
Okay, this is called driving.

388
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:13,336
When you get older,
I'll teach you how.

389
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:18,084
First, you put the
little stick in the hole.

390
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:22,413
Then you move your foot
back and forth.
Okay, what next?

391
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,350
You move the big circle around

392
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:29,616
No problem, I can do this.
I can drive.

393
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:54,246
- Hey.
- Hey, Jimmy.

394
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,582
That silver plane is a VJ-10.

395
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,549
That big plane is a Viscount.

396
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:05,987
- Hey, Carrie.
- What a sweetie.

397
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:10,227
- Is it yours?
- Yeah, but he needs a mother.

398
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,573
I'm kidding. Is this my
schedule?

399
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:22,065
- There's nothing on it.
- I'm sorry.

400
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,980
Do these things come
in different sizes?
What are these, jumbos?

401
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:32,175
- What are you staring at?
- Lunch.

402
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:39,555
Mikey?

403
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,903
Mikey?

404
00:42:56,708 --> 00:43:01,748
I want to report a
missing baby.

405
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:06,423
Maybe he was kidnapped,
or maybe he's with
a complete idiot!

406
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:09,454
Hey, Grandpa.

407
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,120
That's Grandpa.

408
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,160
Do I know you?

409
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,571
- Jimmy!
- Grandpa.

410
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:31,738
- I don't remember your baby.
- It's a friend of mine's.

411
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:36,280
- You sure it isn't yours?
- I've got more teeth than him

412
00:43:37,883 --> 00:43:42,253
What are those hairy jobs
over your eyes?

413
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,730
Let me see those things.
There we go. How
does that feel?

414
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:51,602
- Mikey, lay off him.
- What a crack-up.

415
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:56,028
- Honey, I'm home.
- Me, too.

416
00:43:56,101 --> 00:44:03,271
- Hey, you're up.
- My baby! Honey, honey...

417
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,341
Mommy and her baby...

418
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,519
Idiot! I called the police.
I was worried out of my mind.

419
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:17,623
- You knew I was with him.
- You might be a kidnapper.

420
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:22,559
- I was baby-sitting for you.
- That means the baby
stays here!

421
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:26,969
Damn it! I got a splinter.

422
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:30,042
Let me see it.

423
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:34,341
- Have you got a needle?
- In there.

424
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:40,245
Sit down.

425
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,080
Oh, stop.

426
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:48,519
If you don't hold still,
I can't do this.
It doesn't hurt.

427
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:52,116
It hurts. Don't do it that way

428
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:57,100
- You're poking me!
- Hold still while I get
it out.

429
00:44:57,162 --> 00:45:01,302
- It can't hurt that much.
- How would you know?

430
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:07,436
- Look at that. That's a
big one.
- I've never had one that big

431
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:16,246
- All better.
- Mikey needs a nap.

432
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:23,515
Mikey, I've got to go.
See you.

433
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:31,428
Ready? High-five.
Low-five. Baby-five. Bye.

434
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:37,036
- Bye.
- My little angel-head.

435
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:48,805
- Mollie, who was that?
- The babysitter.

436
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,390
The babysitter?
He's not the frozen pop,
is he?

437
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:58,222
- Ma!
- All right, give me the baby.

438
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:11,803
- Ma...
- What?

439
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:18,101
- You ever get bored
with Daddy?

440
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,319
- How can I get bored
with Daddy?
Mikey needs a father.

441
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,781
- I just can't find
the right guy.

442
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,250
- Mikey will like whoever
you like.

443
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:40,331
- I don't like anybody.
- You know what the secret is?

444
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:43,361
Find someone you
have something in common
with, like Daddy and me.

445
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:52,567
We both like to go
to the movies.
I know someone perfect for you

446
00:47:52,637 --> 00:48:00,977
He's in Daddy's firm.
He's handsome and smart.
You'll love him.

447
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:07,222
Hello! Rosie didn't tell me
you were beautiful.

448
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,985
I'm surprised, that's usually
the first thing she says.

449
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,486
Come on in.

450
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:19,658
This is my son Michael.
I'll get dressed.
Make yourself comfortable.

451
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,800
- Hi, little guy.
- Who's this yutz?

452
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:28,138
Are you watching some TV?

453
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:33,406
Don't touch that.
I don't want to watch football

454
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:37,818
Hey, it's the bear show.
Look at that.

455
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:43,592
- Leave it on football.
- Leave it alone.

456
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,664
- That guy's a good actor.
- Cut it out. It's
the play-offs!

457
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:54,126
You dick.

458
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:02,942
- Baby! Hot mama!
- You're such a goofball.

459
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:06,938
- Don't I look good?
- You look slightly cute.

460
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:11,922
- What are you all dressed
up for?
- I've got a hot date.

461
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:15,723
You'd better call her.
I'm going to be late.

462
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:20,326
Yeah, right. You've got a date
with an accountant. 9:30 tops.

463
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:24,131
- Don't count on it.
- Besides, my woman will wait.

464
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:28,365
Harry, this is the babysitter.
I'll just get my coat.

465
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:31,503
- I'm just watching the
game here.

466
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,969
- Yeah, I've got
money on this game.

467
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,540
So you're an accountant?
You and Mollie
will get along great.

468
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:44,120
- She's a CPA.
- I know, her mom told me.

469
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:48,652
It's got to be tough
being a mom and a CPA.

470
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:55,259
But Mollie is tough.
She hates it when guys
open doors for her -

471
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:59,896
- or pick up the tab.
It really pisses her off.

472
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:04,704
- She's liberated?
- Come on. A guy babysitter?

473
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:11,384
Come here, Mikey.
Say bye-bye to Mama.

474
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:15,212
- Do this.
- Jeez!

475
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,984
Give it back.
This is really embarrassing.

476
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,320
May I just say one thing?

477
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:26,858
- You look better without it.
- I think so, too.

478
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:29,664
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

479
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:35,931
- All right, I'll leave it off
- Great.

480
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,270
Bye-bye. See you.
Mikey, high-five.

481
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:44,879
- Yeah, all right.
- Who was that clown?

482
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,779
It was very uncomfortable.

483
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:57,659
A kind of bloated, gassy...
belchy sensation.

484
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:02,792
I'd sit down in the bathroom..
and nothing would happen.

485
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,760
Nothing would come out.

486
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:11,070
I called my doctor about two..

487
00:51:11,136 --> 00:51:14,406
...three weeks after this
started.

488
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:20,882
He said I'd better come in
and have an ultrasound.

489
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:24,545
- What was I saying?
- Ultrasound.

490
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:31,064
So I went in for the
ultrasound and they
checked it out.

491
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:36,332
It wasn't gallstones.
They didn't know what it was.

492
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:42,234
The doctor said I'd better
have an upper G. I.
So I went in again.

493
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,100
- Have you ever had a
barium enema?
- Not recently.

494
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:51,112
It's disgusting,
but I did get to see
my colon on TV.

495
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:57,046
Is it true that colons
look 10 pounds heavier on TV?

496
00:51:57,715 --> 00:51:59,645
How so?

497
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:07,392
They never do that for me.

498
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:21,014
Get on my knee.

499
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:31,675
- Hold it. Okay.
- Get down, Mikey.

500
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:41,392
Yeah, I can do that.

501
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:46,533
Let's walk.

502
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:53,471
I'm dancing. I'm bad.

503
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:56,808
- Check me out now.
- Jump.

504
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:05,883
Hey, can I get paid?

505
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:20,695
Two, please.

506
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,736
Are you ready?

507
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:36,213
I'm gonna throw up,
but I like it!

508
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:39,281
Okay, shake it up.

509
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:43,685
Right on.

510
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:49,927
Ready? Shake it, Mikey.

511
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,902
Let's go.

512
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:01,306
Aeroplane.

513
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,080
Mikey's a plane.
Look at that boy.

514
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:10,323
All right.

515
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:18,486
Finally, I passed the stone.

516
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:23,486
It's the most excruciating
thing you can have,
next to giving birth.

517
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:27,131
- I had a really good
time tonight. - I bet you did.

518
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:34,137
A lot of guys would
feel threatened by
a woman always wanting to pay.

519
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:37,584
- What?
- Your babysitter told me.

520
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:40,382
- He did, did he?
- Yeah.

521
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:45,422
- Come here.
- No, I really have to go up.

522
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:51,393
- Come on, Mollie, it's early.
- Yeah, but I'm broke.

523
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:53,956
Jerk.

524
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,966
Shit!

525
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,880
I'm home.

526
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:24,760
You can go on your date now.

527
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:58,064
- Hey, Mikey!
- Sarah, how are you doing?

528
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:01,092
- I want to talk to you.
- Sorry, got to go.

529
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:07,896
Right back at you, babe.

530
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:15,565
- Hiya, Mickey.
- Look at that hat.

531
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,510
- Megan, good to see you.
- Mikey, where've you been?

532
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:24,848
- Did you get your hair cut?
- Yeah, what do you think?

533
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:28,715
I hate it.
My mother did it herself.

534
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:32,456
It looks great.

535
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:35,593
I used to have curls
at the end.

536
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,560
- I remember.
- I was the one with the
cute curls.

537
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:44,130
- Now they're gone.
- You're still cute.

538
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:48,911
- I look like a boy.
No offence.
- Nice talking to you.

539
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:01,918
How many babies does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

540
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:07,586
- How many?
- What's a light bulb?

541
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:12,656
I don't get it.

542
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:17,000
Where's she going?
Who's that big guy?

543
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:23,507
- Who is he?
- That's okay.
That's her daddy.

544
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:27,414
What's a daddy?
What do they do?

545
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:33,218
The big men types
who hang around with
the mommies.

546
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,793
I get it. Maybe I'll ask James
to be my daddy.

547
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:49,865
We 'll eat all the
pudding now...

548
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:56,973
- I still ain't eating it.
- Yummy.

549
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:04,621
All right, don't look at Mommy

550
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:21,228
You've got to love her.

551
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:42,286
Watch this, Mikey.

552
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:57,600
- Now that's entertainment.
- Not in front of Mikey.

553
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:03,107
- Look at the look on his face
- He looks like his father.

554
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:06,639
You said
you were artificially
inseminated.

555
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:11,651
i was, but i never
make that face.
i assume his father does.

556
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:15,786
You know what I thought
you'd enjoy doing today?

557
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:21,533
- Go to my grandfather's
new home.
- You thought I'd enjoy that?

558
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:27,002
Yeah, you'd enjoy it...
Maybe you'd sign a few papers.

559
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:31,704
You are such a baby.
If you want me to do
something, just ask.

560
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:37,509
Would you please come with me
to sign these papers?

561
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,484
- That's how you
handle a woman.
- Really?

562
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:50,416
You want to go to lunch
at North Eastern
Life lnsurance?

563
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:54,657
- Employees get free lunches.
- We'll get caught.

564
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:58,725
I must know 20 ways
to get a free lunch
in this town.

565
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:02,596
- You do this a lot?
- Sure.

566
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:08,967
I don't pay for L. D.'s,
either. Long
distance phone calls.

567
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,109
I go up to a company
receptionist.

568
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:19,716
I pretend I'm a lost messenger
and they let me use
their phone.

569
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:25,094
I wouldn't be driving this cab
if I made more instructing.

570
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:31,055
- What do flight instructors
make?
- If I hustle, about 1, 100...

571
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:36,798
...a month.
But I get to accumulate
air time.

572
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:45,610
- Give me my bag!
- He's not stealing our bags.

573
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:49,676
- I've got my teeth in there.
- They're coming with us.

574
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:53,317
Tell him not to touch my teeth

575
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:01,487
Welcome, gramps.

576
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:06,758
- Are we stopping for a bite
to eat?
- No, this is your new place.

577
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:10,741
- They got good shrimp here?
- And lobster.

578
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:14,441
This is it. Enjoy your stay.

579
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,544
Grandpa, this is great.

580
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:23,848
You've got a terrific view.
No roommate to bug you.
Television.

581
01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:26,824
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

582
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:32,264
He's got a sweet tooth.
Give him one candy bar a day.

583
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:38,502
- Just don't let him
find the bag
. - No problem.

584
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,566
That smells good.

585
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:47,811
- Grandpa, that smells good.
- I'd like to see you eat it.

586
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:50,442
Watch this.

587
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:56,347
Let me try that.

588
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:03,693
- What do you want?
- Mollie helped us
get this place.

589
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:10,094
The woman has thousands
more nerves in the sexual
organs than the man.

590
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,070
- I bet the kid's not
even yours.
- That's it! Be nice.

591
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:22,107
He's worse at this than I am.
Let me give you a hand.

592
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,238
Come on, taste it.

593
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,210
Open wide.

594
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:35,216
- Thank you for helping me.
- You're welcome.

595
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:39,185
- You want to go flying?
- That would be way
too expensive.

596
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:45,356
- Maintenance flights are free
- You get everything for free.

597
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:50,029
Free phone calls, free
lunches...
You're a scam artist.

598
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:57,310
I've got the town wired.
If we were poor,
we'd still live like kings.

599
01:02:57,374 --> 01:03:01,154
- Fly with me.
- I'm not that kind of person.

600
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:06,751
- Come on. Are you scared?
- No, I'm not scared!

601
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:11,457
- Where are the parachutes?
- There are no parachutes.

602
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:19,103
Didn't you ever see
"The Buddy Holly Story",
"La Bamba"?

603
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:24,503
There's one big difference.
They were rock legends.
You're not.

604
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:28,538
- Is your wing smoking?
- No... Oh, my God!

605
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:33,435
- It was just a joke to
relax you.
- I'm just so nervous.

606
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,410
I feel so out of control.

607
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,420
I'll give you your
first lesson.
Put your hand on my stick.

608
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:47,216
- I'm not touching your stick.
- This is not a sexual thing.

609
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,991
That feels good, baby.

610
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,000
Get familiar with the stick.

611
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:58,974
- There you go, you're flying.
- I'm flying!

612
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:06,644
I'm doing a good job.
This is easy! What a
good sensation!

613
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,810
- It's like great sex,
isn't it?

614
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:12,579
- I personally wouldn't
remember.

615
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:17,149
- He's pretty tired.
- He's had a busy day.

616
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:26,257
- Do you want a drink?
- Do you want to watch
a movie?

617
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:25,393
Stop it!

618
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:29,825
Stop yelling or your
father will give you something
to yell about.

619
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,661
Knock it off!

620
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:39,869
Princess,
you're making my mouth water.

621
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,136
I'm hungry.

622
01:05:42,206 --> 01:05:48,176
Hold your horses, or I'll
knock you from here to
kingdom come.

623
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:53,175
You know that dumpster behind
the supermarket? Look
what I found.

624
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:59,020
A perfectly good head
of lettuce, just peel
off the outer layers

625
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:05,529
Who wants a surprise?
Could be lunch
meat or peaches.

626
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:11,335
The point is this:
Just because it's free,
don't mean it's no good.

627
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:16,671
- Do we live like kings,
or what?
- We sure do.

628
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:29,247
Again!

629
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,389
Wait a minute.

630
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:36,526
- I'm sorry, I really
do want this.
- I do, too.

631
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:39,963
- It's Mikey.
- He's asleep.

632
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:46,700
I have to be very clear
on the choices I make for him.

633
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:53,810
I can't make any more mistakes
that are going to hurt Mikey.

634
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:59,477
- But I'm crazy about Mikey.
- I know that I was
leading you on.

635
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:03,619
You're such a good kisser and
I haven't had sex in a
long time...

636
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:10,358
Goodbye. Please... Goodbye.

637
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:16,297
- Mollie, could I talk to you?
- Hold just a minute, please.

638
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:20,666
Just between you and me,
what's with you and
Chubby Charles?

639
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:24,305
What do you mean?

640
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:28,984
Pearlman's doing the bank recs
Rubenstein's doing
the quarterlies.

641
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:33,575
Now Albert's returns are due.
So what's with you?

642
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:39,790
I traded Rubenstein two
accounts for the Chubby
Charles account.

643
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:42,956
I can't do it anymore...
It's personal.

644
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:50,726
We're accountants...
we're not personal.

645
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,640
- I don't...
- You've worked for
him for years.

646
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,814
Now, with all the new tax laws
you desert him.

647
01:07:56,873 --> 01:08:02,013
- You don't understand...
- I want you up there tomorrow

648
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:06,718
Don't give me that look.
And you, get back to work.

649
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:16,487
Please, give me a second
chance. This has been
like a bad dream

650
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,900
I felt so guilty
leaving Beth and the girls.

651
01:08:19,963 --> 01:08:26,403
You've been such an asshole,
I'd have to torture you.

652
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:31,074
That's okay. I want you to.

653
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:34,641
- Mollie, Mollie...
- What?

654
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:38,651
- I'll burst if I don't
kiss you.
- Tough!

655
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,689
Albert can see you now.

656
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:56,432
- Mollie, how's Mickey?
- Mikey.

657
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,500
- Is he talking yet?
- No.

658
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:03,439
Crawling?
I remember Astrid crawling...

659
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:07,177
I'm not interested in
your stories.

660
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:13,684
- I've been meaning to
talk to you.
- I'm here to do your taxes.

661
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:19,662
Eyelash tinting,
body wraps, facials...

662
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:24,593
- You can't deduct any
of this crap.
- And the exercise instructor?

663
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:27,561
Not unless she suffered
any injury.

664
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:31,771
What's the little
woman been up to?

665
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:38,981
Is Priscilla sick?
These doctor bills are for her

666
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:42,152
Therapy.
Beth communicaes with the dead

667
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:44,452
It really frightens Priscilla.

668
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:50,354
We're all seeing a
psychiatrist now.
I've been learning a lot.

669
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:55,160
- I'm happy for you, Albert.
- I know you've been
through a lot.

670
01:09:55,225 --> 01:10:00,955
You've got to believe
I love you. I never meant
for this to go bad.

671
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:06,040
- It just turned out that way.
- It took $20,000 to
find that out?

672
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:13,044
- Do you have a picture of
Mickey?
- Mikey!

673
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:17,049
- I think about you two
every day.
- You'd never know it.

674
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:20,723
I try to call, but
I can't do it.

675
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:25,394
I'm too ashamed.
I'm afraid of what you'll say.

676
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:28,925
I've been so confused.

677
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:44,344
- He has my eyes.
- I know.

678
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:48,948
It's confusing loving someone
who looks like someone
you hate.

679
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:51,252
Could I see him?

680
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:59,491
All right.
I'll be home this evening.

681
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:04,556
Next time you talk to your mom
put in a good word in for me.

682
01:11:04,628 --> 01:11:07,428
Hit me. Hit it again.

683
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:10,667
- No... yeah?
- Hit it again.

684
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:17,168
- I know what I'm doing.
- Damn! You won again.

685
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:23,080
I told you I could play.
I've been thinking about
this daddy business.

686
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:26,516
I want you to be my daddy.
I'll tell Mommy.

687
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:31,958
- Who is it?
- Mollie?

688
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:41,502
- Is Mollie here?
- No, she's at aerobics class.

689
01:11:41,565 --> 01:11:46,135
- Is Mikey here?
I'm his father.
- His father?

690
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:50,542
- Are you the sperm donor?
- I'm the kid's father?

691
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:57,147
- He's from artificial
insemination.
- I've known Mollie for years.

692
01:11:57,213 --> 01:12:01,553
- I have a key.
- We're changing it.

693
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:05,558
- What?
- That's my kid in there.
Let me by.

694
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:09,432
If you are the father,
answer me a few questions.

695
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:14,303
- When was he born?
- July third.

696
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:17,974
What's his favourite toy,
Fred or Barney? Fred?

697
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:22,974
No, Barney. How many diapers
does he go through a day? Six.

698
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:28,954
- A father should know.
- How much is she paying you?

699
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:32,822
- Go play some video games.
- Don't give me that shit.

700
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:38,918
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

701
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:42,928
Go for the body!

702
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:51,397
Get out of here!

703
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:57,967
Yes, that feels good.

704
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:09,318
- What happened?
- Who's Albert?

705
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:13,785
- Why, was he here?
- Is he Mikey's father?

706
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:21,225
- You lied about the
insemination.
- He was married.

707
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:26,067
Do you love him?

708
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:29,565
- What?
- Do you love him?

709
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:33,209
I don't know who I love.

710
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:37,846
The only thing that
matters to me is who's
best for Mikey.

711
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:44,994
Albert is successful,
responsible and he's good
to his other kids.

712
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:46,794
- I don't want him seeing
Mikey.

713
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:50,456
- Don't start pulling
this on me.

714
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:57,399
- He has a right to see
his son.
- Where has he been all year?

715
01:13:57,467 --> 01:14:03,007
- You are not his father.
- I'm the closest
thing he's got.

716
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:06,582
Look at you.
You're like a big kid.

717
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:11,483
Are you responsible enough
to be a father?

718
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:15,118
Is getting pregnant by
a married man responsible?

719
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,954
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

720
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:23,931
I've seen you use Mikey
to push guys away,
and now you're doing it to me.

721
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:28,063
- Get out!
- I live here!

722
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:39,779
Can a person past
a certain age change?

723
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:43,113
Daddy's lipids fell to 185.

724
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:48,219
I'm not talking about
cholesterol. Can
someone become nicer?

725
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,315
I don't know.

726
01:14:51,387 --> 01:14:57,127
When you met Daddy
at that dance, did you
know he'd be a good father?

727
01:14:57,193 --> 01:15:03,333
- I liked the look of
his uniform.
- They all wore uniforms.

728
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:06,569
I didn't like
the sailors' bell-bottoms.

729
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:12,336
You had no idea if he was
a mature responsible person.

730
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:17,878
If I thought like that,
we wouldn't have had
so much fun the first week.

731
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:23,187
You're grossing me out.
Don't talk about sex and Daddy

732
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,820
Hi, Lupe.

733
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:32,161
I just want to talk to Mikey
for a minute.

734
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:37,400
Hey, Gerber-face, high-five.

735
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:46,314
Look, Mikey... I don't know
if I can keep coming
to see you.

736
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,675
- What's the matter?
- It's your mom.

737
01:15:49,746 --> 01:15:54,276
She's got this crazy idea
that I wouldn't make a
good father.

738
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,693
She probably wouldn't
have picked my father, either.

739
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:05,896
I think he did an okay job.
Want to hear some
fatherly advice?

740
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:11,837
Hi, Lupe.

741
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:18,711
- The man's in the baby's room
- Okay, I'll write you a check

742
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:24,705
He said, "Don't hit girls,
even if they're
asking for it."

743
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,624
What about pushing them?

744
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:36,194
He'd say, "Finish your meat,
you know how much that cost?"

745
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:41,829
The one that sticks
out the most was probably...

746
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:46,768
"lf your friend jumps off
a bridge, does that mean
you've got to?"

747
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:53,276
To this very day,
I still use that piece
of advice.

748
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:58,745
It doesn't amount to much.

749
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:06,355
A good father keeps the
mother happy so she doesn't
drive the kids crazy.

750
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:10,492
She called me a big kid...
She's probably right.

751
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:14,659
You're one year old
and my best friend
in the world.

752
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:18,331
Anyway...

753
01:17:20,704 --> 01:17:25,074
- I'll miss you.
- Don't be sad.
Here, take this.

754
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:37,517
- No, I want you to have it.
- Okay, thanks.

755
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,986
He'll take good care of you.

756
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:47,662
- We're going to see
Daddy today.

757
01:17:47,731 --> 01:17:51,071
- I was just thinking
about James.

758
01:17:51,134 --> 01:17:57,114
- The blue or the lamb?
- They both look pretty lame.

759
01:17:57,173 --> 01:18:00,913
- The lamb?
- Not lamb, lame!

760
01:18:00,977 --> 01:18:05,407
Please don't make me
wear clothes with
animals on them.

761
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:09,791
I don't like this.
It makes me look stupid.

762
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:17,288
- You look great.
- I feel like a retard.

763
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:23,734
Look at this room.
Look at these guys.

764
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,070
I bet I could take
those apart.

765
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:32,436
Little metal things...
I'll stick them in
those little holes.

766
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:38,946
Mollie, hi. This must be Mikey

767
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:44,045
Hiya, fella. What are
you doing?

768
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:48,320
- Aren't you a handsome...
- Milk in the eye.

769
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:50,661
Bull's-eye!

770
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:55,656
It's all right.
It's just milk, it won't stain

771
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:04,774
- He's beautiful. He looks
like you.
- A lot of people say that.

772
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:10,181
I know the circumstances
you had him under
were terrible.

773
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:15,146
- But I know it wasn't a
mistake.
- I bet he's glad to hear that

774
01:19:15,218 --> 01:19:19,358
You will never escape me.

775
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:23,232
- Mikey, don't do that!
- What did I do?

776
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:34,069
Some people don't have
the strength to get out
certain situations.

777
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:36,837
What are you trying to say?
Mikey, don't touch that.

778
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:42,946
I'm saying I still love you
and I still want you.

779
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:48,992
- And what about Mikey?
- Count on me. Whatever
he needs.

780
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:52,419
He needs a father.

781
01:19:54,223 --> 01:20:00,333
I'm living alone for the
first time in 17 years.
I'm in therapy.

782
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:04,526
I can't be anybody's
father now.
I need to be by myself.

783
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:09,910
- I've raised my kids.
- Raised them? They're
11 and 9!

784
01:20:09,973 --> 01:20:14,813
- Have they moved out?
- Too much fruit!

785
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:19,278
It wouldn't be fair to Mikey.

786
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:23,618
- Is he taking a dump?
- No, he's thinking real hard.

787
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:32,925
- I'll get you cleaned up.
- Use the washroom in the back

788
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:39,236
- He'll ask about his daddy.
- I want James to be the daddy

789
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:44,912
Don't do that here.
That's a $10,000 desk!

790
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:49,714
- Now it's junk!
- I thought you'd understand.

791
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:56,618
Of course I understand.
You're going through a
selfish phase.

792
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:01,515
I know you will understand
that I'm going through a
destructive phase.

793
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:10,373
Let's trash the place.

794
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:20,736
I'm sorry about that
stupid outfit.

795
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:25,879
I'm sorry I made you meet
that mean man. Never again.

796
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:31,819
every time i take you
someplace, people are crazy
about you.

797
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:38,257
Yet the person who has
a genetic bond to you treats
you like a jerk.

798
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:42,267
Everybody loves you.
All the kids at the
playground.

799
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:45,371
Ma loves you. Rona loves you.

800
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:50,574
James loves you.
Mikey, do you love James?

801
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:58,446
- Give him a call.
- Do you want to play
telephone?

802
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:01,384
Hello?

803
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:06,390
It's for you. You take
this one, I'll take
the other one.

804
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:13,455
This is Lou Franklin,
I'm phoning about
your grandfather.

805
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:17,329
He's become abusive
and violent.

806
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,930
- Should I call Health
& Welfare?

807
01:22:19,002 --> 01:22:22,812
- No, I'll come and
pick him up.

808
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:38,790
- What's going on?
- I'm a hostage.

809
01:22:38,854 --> 01:22:40,524
He's a mean old bastard!

810
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:44,789
- Look what he did to my arm?
- Don't talk to him like that.

811
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:48,630
- They're hiding Dora.
- They are not.

812
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:55,637
- Then where is she?
- Sit down. I'll find
her for you.

813
01:22:55,704 --> 01:23:01,914
Let's get your face cleaned up
You want to look good for her.

814
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:07,817
You're my favourite
daughter-in-law.
You're smart and a good person

815
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:12,593
That's why Jimmy loves
you so much.

816
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:20,298
- There you go.
- Let's go find James.

817
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:24,333
I'll show you some pictures.

818
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:30,438
Grandpa, did you eat all these
candy bars today?

819
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:34,906
- The bastards stole my candy.
- We'll get some more.

820
01:23:34,977 --> 01:23:38,647
- Where's the director's
office?
- Down the hall.

821
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:42,924
- We're busy.
- I'll keep my eye
on them for you.

822
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:46,415
I'll be back in a minute.

823
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:55,433
This isn't his usual behaviour
My husband made arrangements.

824
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:59,938
It isn't the orderly's
responsibility to control
his diet.

825
01:24:01,604 --> 01:24:03,274
He requires a private nurse.

826
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:12,419
No, he doesn't. The orderly
was told to give him one
candy bar a day.

827
01:24:12,481 --> 01:24:16,621
- He said no problem.
- That was Bill.

828
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:22,085
Bill always says no problem.
The man can't speak English.

829
01:24:23,926 --> 01:24:27,656
- So can Grandpa stay?
- Of course.

830
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:34,070
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming
down so fast.

831
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:41,406
- Hi.
- Hi.

832
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:47,217
- Your grandfather can stay.
- You didn't have to do that.

833
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:52,323
- I wanted to do it.
- Let me give you a ride home.

834
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:55,858
- Don't bother.
- Fine!

835
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:00,204
D.J., it's time for lunch.
Let's go.

836
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:04,403
- Are you okay with him?
- Get the hell out of here.

837
01:25:06,402 --> 01:25:11,012
Steven and Paulie,
they're your cousins.

838
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:17,048
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello, Esther.

839
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:26,890
Esther... I'd like you
to meet my grandson.

840
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:31,460
Hey, there goes James.

841
01:25:31,527 --> 01:25:36,197
Where's he going?
Maybe he's going downstairs.

842
01:25:36,265 --> 01:25:41,535
- They took me to the
beauty salon.
- Where's the elevator.

843
01:25:41,604 --> 01:25:44,774
Going down.

844
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,380
I'll just press all these.

845
01:25:52,047 --> 01:25:56,617
Perfect! I'll just hitch
a ride with the fruit cups.

846
01:25:59,322 --> 01:26:03,032
There we go.
Take her away, boys.

847
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:08,129
- Mikey.
- Grandpa, where's Mikey?

848
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:14,397
- He was just here.
- How long ago did he leave?

849
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:18,410
- I'll check the hallway.
- I'm calling the police.

850
01:26:20,543 --> 01:26:23,583
Hi, toots. Anyone seen my dad?

851
01:26:23,646 --> 01:26:30,516
- That's lda's grandson.
- Come on, I'm in a hurry.

852
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:36,186
- Here, fella, go find
your grandma.
- Thanks for nothing.

853
01:26:36,259 --> 01:26:41,729
When the police get here,
will you show them
these pictures?

854
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:44,897
All right, I'm on the
case now.

855
01:26:48,804 --> 01:26:51,574
That is exactly what I need.

856
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:56,350
I could find him in
one of those.
Let's see if I remember this.

857
01:26:56,412 --> 01:27:01,182
I'll set this thing down
right here and get
that door open.

858
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:05,786
What was it James said?

859
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:10,064
Stick this in here...
There it goes.

860
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:13,755
Move the circle around
and we're off.

861
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:16,129
Mikey!

862
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:18,828
Mikey!

863
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:27,441
- He's in the back of that car
- Let's get the cab.

864
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:31,080
- Hey!
- Stop!

865
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:43,258
I got this driving thing
knocked.

866
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:51,327
Move it!

867
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:58,239
There he is. Look at me.
Hey, James, I'm driving!

868
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:05,812
James... where's he going?

869
01:28:10,152 --> 01:28:11,422
- What are you doing?
- I'll cut him off.

870
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:13,787
You'll lose him.

871
01:28:17,893 --> 01:28:21,733
I know this alley
like the back of my hand.

872
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,450
Mikey! He's gone!

873
01:28:42,518 --> 01:28:45,218
Mikey!

874
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:50,557
- You had a little
boy in there.
- What are you talking about?

875
01:28:50,626 --> 01:28:53,426
He's about this big.

876
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:58,166
- This is a good
place to spot him.
- Mikey!

877
01:28:58,233 --> 01:29:01,503
Mikey, stop!

878
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:04,910
- James, is that you?
- Mikey, don't move.

879
01:29:04,973 --> 01:29:08,343
James, Mommy...

880
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,354
Here I come.

881
01:29:12,415 --> 01:29:15,745
- Mikey!
- I'm coming.

882
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:32,069
- Did you see what just
happened?
- Give me my baby.

883
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:39,313
Are you all right, honey?
Let me see you.

884
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,554
He doesn't have a
scratch on him.

885
01:29:42,611 --> 01:29:45,481
I finally got you
both together.

886
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:49,888
I better take
him to the hospital anyway.

887
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:54,062
Ma, I want James
to be the daddy.

888
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:58,432
- Thanks for all your help.
- I'll take you home now.

889
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:06,769
- Dada.
- I think he called you Dada.

890
01:30:06,835 --> 01:30:09,395
No, I'm talking
to hear myself speak.

891
01:30:09,472 --> 01:30:13,882
- He thinks you're his father.
- I've spent a lot
of time with him.

892
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:18,182
He probably thinks
we're going to end
up together.

893
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:32,063
I hope
they don't get stuck together.

894
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:41,665
Should I tell them
I need a new diaper?

895
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:43,707
No, I'll wait.

896
01:31:36,725 --> 01:31:41,055
- Hi, honey.
- Mikey, this is your
sister Julie.

897
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:43,699
Say "Hi, Julie."

898
01:31:43,766 --> 01:31:48,936
Don't start with me,
kid! I've had a day
you wouldn't believe.

899
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:37,525
