1
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:42,024
I think your bookkeeper
paid for the flatware twice.

2
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:46,361
Albert, stop.
I can't do this any more.

3
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:49,448
Mollie, I love you and you love me.

4
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:54,328
Albert, you're great in bed
and you're my biggest account...

5
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:56,914
...but you're married!

6
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,504
And I'll never fall in love with
anyone else while I'm seeing you.

7
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,799
You know I'm leaving Beth.
It just takes time.

8
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:14,515
Every time I say the word divorce,
she loses five pounds.

9
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:18,018
I'm sorry she's bulimic.

10
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:22,689
- I can't wait for you forever.
- It's going to work out soon.

11
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:29,238
The doctor prescribed new pills
and she's starting ballet classes.

12
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:35,911
- It'll be like the playwriting.
- She knows this can't make her fat.

13
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:39,581
She said
writing made her ass spread.

14
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:44,586
Which is insane, she's got
a great ass for a 40-year-old.

15
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:49,007
I'll tell Mr. Ross to give
your account to someone else.

16
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:56,056
I won't let him. I'll never let
anyone else touch my books.

17
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:07,150
God, Mollie, I'm going to burst
if you don't kiss me soon.

18
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:52,863
<i>Follow me. I know where I'm going.</i>
<i>I've got the map. Come on.</i>

19
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,119
<i>Come on, keep up, you kids.</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

20
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:03,916
<i>Wait a minute, I see something.</i>

21
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:07,586
<i>I think this is it,</i>
<i>right over here.</i>

22
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:12,299
<i>This is definitely it.</i>
<i>This is the place.</i>

23
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:15,052
<i>Jackpot!</i>

24
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:20,599
<i>Right down here, kids.</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

25
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:28,732
<i>Dig in, you kids. Here we go.</i>

26
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,319
<i>It's kind of tough here.</i>

27
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:37,699
<i>Oh,</i> oh...

28
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:40,869
<i>I'm in!</i>

29
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:12,818
Are you okay?

30
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:16,321
- I broke up with George.
- Who?

31
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:24,288
George. I met him in Joe Allen's.
He turned out to be stupid.

32
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:33,672
You look lousy, doll.

33
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,928
- Stomach flu. It's going around.
- Nobody has the stomach flu.

34
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:43,974
They don't?
You want to hear about Albert?

35
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,895
- Listen to me.
- I am.

36
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:53,233
Albert's shrink said his wife would
never recover if he kept seeing me.

37
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,863
- He's decided to leave her.
- Albert's leaving his wife?

38
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,536
No, he's leaving his shrink. She was
really an obstacle between us.

39
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:08,874
Leaving his shrink?
He's supposed to leave his wife.

40
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:15,631
He's going to. He can't leave her
while she's sick. She's bulimic.

41
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,428
Don't give me that look.
It's a very serious disease.

42
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:56,839
<i>What in the... Wait a minute.</i>

43
00:06:57,005 --> 00:07:00,926
<i>I've got two of these things.</i>
<i>Look at that, they match.</i>

44
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:06,807
- You ate all that already?
- How weird, I don't like ice cream.

45
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:11,395
- There he is.
- This is sick.

46
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:16,733
He looks so sweet with the kids.
If only Beth would stop throwing up.

47
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,906
Miss Popularity, you can't expect to
find a husband if you never go out.

48
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:27,911
- You're in every night of the week.
- Ma, it's tax season.

49
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:31,290
I was studying to pass a CPA exam, -

50
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:36,295
- and I still managed
to catch your father.

51
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:42,467
What if Daddy was married
when you first met him?

52
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:46,096
- I wouldn't have fallen for him.
- You can't control that.

53
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:51,101
Why not?
Listen, take your father here...

54
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:56,356
His favourite food was cheesecake,
and what did the doctor tell him?

55
00:07:56,523 --> 00:08:01,945
- "Cut back on cholesterol."
- Now he doesn't eat cheesecake.

56
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:05,782
Ma, that doesn't make any sense.

57
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,162
You never used to like my food.
Something's wrong.

58
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,665
- Nothing's wrong.
- Louie, something's wrong.

59
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:17,794
- I didn't eat breakfast.
- Something's wrong.

60
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:26,136
No.

61
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:30,933
Oh, no!

62
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:34,978
- Yes!
- Oh, no!

63
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:40,817
- This wasn't a planned pregnancy?
- This wasn't even a planned affair.

64
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:45,489
Well...
let's see how far along we are.

65
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:56,291
<i>Time out! Holy cow,</i>
<i>what was that? Who's that?</i>

66
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,711
How could this have happened?

67
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:04,550
- How old are you now, Mollie?
- 33.

68
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:09,012
Remember,
your biological clock is ticking.

69
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:24,653
Beth finally agreed to a divorce.
Mollie, I'm so glad you waited.

70
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,992
I knew if I was patient,
this day would come.

71
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:37,416
Remember your biological clock.

72
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:58,103
My biological clock is ticking...

73
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,024
I know, I've already said that.
I didn't plan on this.

74
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:06,111
I'm not asking for anything.
I don't want to trap you.

75
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:12,034
But this baby... it's you and
me, and I'm not getting an abortion.

76
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:18,499
I wasn't going to ask you to.
This will be an incredible baby.

77
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:24,296
He'll have your sweet face
and my business sense.

78
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:29,092
- We'll get little Armani diapers.
- It will be a great kid.

79
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,347
<i>Having my baby</i>
<i>what a way to say you love me</i>

80
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:38,143
Albert, you're making me sick.
I hate that song.

81
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:42,898
<i>Stop singing.</i>
<i>She gets sick, I get sick.</i>

82
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:46,652
What are you going to tell people?

83
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:49,821
That I got artificially inseminated.

84
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:55,702
What?
How could you do such a thing?

85
00:10:55,869 --> 00:11:00,082
I went to the clinic
and bought some frozen sperm.

86
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:06,296
- I inserted it, now I'm pregnant.
- Where's the frozen pop?

87
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:12,302
- There's no frozen pop.
- There's no husband.

88
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:16,265
I control my life
and I want to have a baby.

89
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:21,019
This kind of thing a girl does
if she's very ugly or a lesbian.

90
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:25,816
This is not the act
of a beautiful intelligent girl.

91
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:30,445
You never liked
any of my boyfriends, anyway.

92
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:35,576
- Where did this sperm come from?
- A medical student.

93
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:40,205
He goes to Columbia.
His parents live on the Island.

94
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:44,835
His father's in piece goods.
His mother works in cosmetics.

95
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:48,797
So you're making fun of me.
Wait, you'll see.

96
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:52,676
Someday you'll have children.

97
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:10,152
Look... an arm. It's an arm.

98
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:16,408
Look... isn't it cute?

99
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:39,431
Here's the head... isn't it?

100
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:56,281
<i>Get some apple juice down here!</i>

101
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:06,542
- Thirsty?
- Go ahead.

102
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:12,339
"The sex organs are moulded
out of similar tissue folds."

103
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:16,635
"By the second trimester
they are identifiable."

104
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:20,472
<i>Look, another arm</i>
<i>coming in down there...</i>

105
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,102
<i>How am I going to get that</i>
<i>in my mouth?</i>

106
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:31,400
Miss, excuse me...

107
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:36,071
- What can I do for you?
- Albert is expecting me.

108
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:42,202
He's in with his decorator.
You can wait over there.

109
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:50,878
- I think you're going to enjoy it.
- I'm sure I will.

110
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:55,340
- Remember to dust it every day.
- See you later.

111
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:59,052
Hi, come on in.

112
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:12,107
Albert, was that woman pretty?

113
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:17,279
- No, you're pretty.
- I look like a big, fat pilgrim.

114
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:20,991
How do you like the desk?

115
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:25,245
- It's made of stone.
- It's all right.

116
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:30,000
It's going to be great in here.
This is all going.

117
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:34,755
I'm having a custom-made mural
of an ancient Navajo design.

118
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:39,718
Leather craftsmen in Mexico
are going to make all new couches.

119
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:47,184
- What do you think?
- I like the deco stuff.

120
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:52,689
- Don't gain too much weight.
- My doctor says my weight is fine.

121
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:59,738
Beth only gained 21 pounds.
She jogged three miles a day.

122
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:03,617
- Maybe you should marry her.
- Don't start.

123
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:10,207
- I've got problems, too.
- Sorry. I'm afraid of giving birth.

124
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:14,628
- I've never been real big on pain.
- You been to Lamaze?

125
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:18,465
I quit.
It's just a bunch of breathing.

126
00:15:18,632 --> 00:15:22,886
It's so much better for the baby.
When Beth had Priscilla...

127
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:27,099
I'm so sick of hearing about Beth!

128
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:31,603
How could you be in love with her
and then in love with me?

129
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,274
I have a degree.
She took belly-dancing lessons.

130
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,071
When I found out I was pregnant,
I decided to make out a will.

131
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:46,451
When Beth had the girls, she had
a reading of their past lives.

132
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:53,250
- And you're still with her!
- Oh yeah? Look at this receipt.

133
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:57,421
- Galleria Apartments.
- I moved out. I did it.

134
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:00,757
I put down a deposit this morning.

135
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:05,721
I can't believe it!
Should I come by tonight?

136
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:09,766
You'd better not.
We've still got to be careful.

137
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:14,438
Albert, I'm so happy!

138
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:23,363
I wonder if this store
has a bathroom. I have to go again.

139
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:30,454
I love this... Look,
it takes two of them to cover me.

140
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,708
- Yeah, but you're having a baby.
- You try it on.

141
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:39,379
- Should I have a baby with Neal?
- Do you love him?

142
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:42,382
No.

143
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:48,347
Try some of that
Nobel Prize winners' sperm.

144
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:51,642
Don't you want a smart baby?

145
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:57,856
That's all I need. A baby
telling me what an idiot I am.

146
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:03,737
- I found a nice family man.
- Except it's someone else's family.

147
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:08,742
That's why he left.
He loves me and we're having baby.

148
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:14,164
It sounds like the people
in the next compartment are.

149
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:27,636
- Mollie!
- Albert!

150
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:33,308
- Let me explain...
- These dresses aren't paid for.

151
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:39,481
- Don't take this shit from him.
- I'm going to call the cops.

152
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:42,401
After you. Thank you.

153
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:46,864
- Albert, what's going on?
- Mollie, I've fallen in love.

154
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,868
Beth knows.
I'm going to live with Melissa.

155
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:56,039
I don't know if it'll last.
It just happened.

156
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:59,459
Why didn't you say anything to me?

157
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:03,589
You were so close
to the end of your pregnancy.

158
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:06,550
I don't believe this is happening.

159
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:11,263
This sounds awful, but
I'm going through a selfish phase.

160
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,601
- A selfish phase?
- I admit the timing is bad.

161
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:19,855
- A selfish phase?
- It just happened.

162
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:24,276
A selfish phase!
Albert, you dick.

163
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:29,531
- You lousy prick!
- Leave him alone.

164
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:33,452
- Come on.
- Here.

165
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:36,580
<i>Hey, what the...</i>

166
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:42,586
- Wait, please, I'm in labour.
- I was here first.

167
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:48,926
Asshole! Taxi! Please...

168
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:58,227
St. Jerome's Hospital.

169
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:01,688
Oh, shit!

170
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:11,156
- Slow down! It can take hours.
- So can the midtown traffic.

171
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,127
Pull over till the ludes wear off.

172
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,552
God, you idiot!

173
00:19:31,718 --> 00:19:35,430
Come on, move it.

174
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:43,438
Christ, this traffic...
We're going as fast as we can.

175
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:49,403
Hold onto my hand. Bear down, that's
what they say in the hospital.

176
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:56,660
- Come on, move it.
- God, my water just broke.

177
00:19:56,827 --> 00:20:02,332
- Hey, buddy, move it.
- You can't get through here.

178
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:06,879
- I've got an emergency.
- Sorry, buddy, move it.

179
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:14,970
Just relax.
Hold on, we're almost there.

180
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:18,473
Look out! You're going to hit...!

181
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:26,064
Hold on!

182
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:31,028
You stupid son of a...!

183
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:35,616
- Are you doing your Lamaze?
- Look out!

184
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:43,749
- Breathe deep.
- Don't try to help, just drive!

185
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,962
You've got to use Lamaze.
My sister-in-law used it.

186
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:53,509
- It's better for the kid.
- All men are stupid idiots.

187
00:20:55,177 --> 00:21:00,224
- Should I call your husband?
- I don't have a husband.

188
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,561
- I was artificially inseminated.
- Are you a lesbo?

189
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,751
Stupid jerk! My kid will probably
be brain damaged because of you.

190
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:34,091
Don't touch me! I'll have this baby
without you touching me.

191
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:41,056
- Excuse me, I'm in labour.
- Do you have your medical card?

192
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:46,144
- I left it at home.
- I have to have your medical card.

193
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:51,567
- This is my first baby.
- She's getting close. Upstairs.

194
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:56,780
You didn't finish this.
I cannot do my job...

195
00:21:56,947 --> 00:22:03,453
- Put these on over your clothes.
- I'm not the father.

196
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,710
- Nurse, another one's coming.
- Deep breaths, come on.

197
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:13,213
<i>Okay, this'll pass. Watch the head.</i>

198
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,593
God! I need some drugs.

199
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,264
- Slow down your breathing.
- Fuck my breathing!

200
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:27,978
- You've got to calm down.
- Get me some drugs.

201
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:33,025
- No, you don't want drugs.
- I do. I'm going to split in two.

202
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:37,696
By the time they
take effect she could be delivering.

203
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:42,993
- But what about now?
- I'm waiting for a doctor.

204
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:49,291
Are you a doctor? Come on.

205
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,964
- Water break?
- Half an hour ago.

206
00:22:56,131 --> 00:23:01,595
- Are we doing our Lamaze breathing?
- I dropped out of Lamaze.

207
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:05,807
I'll go to summer school
if you make the pain stop.

208
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:10,687
- How about some Demerol?
- God, that'd be great!

209
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:15,859
I'd like some of that.
Give me a lot of it.

210
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:19,404
So it doesn't wear off
during the birth.

211
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:25,619
I think maybe I'm in a bit more pain
than most of your patients.

212
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:29,248
Be sure and give me enough.

213
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:34,878
- There we go.
- Thank you a really lot.

214
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:39,132
<i>That is a little more like it.</i>

215
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:43,303
<i>Hey, here's Mr. Hand here.</i>

216
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:49,852
<i>Now that is very cosmic.</i>
<i>I don't understand...</i>

217
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:54,648
<i>What's that light down there?</i>

218
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:59,653
That's it, breathe!

219
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,575
Attagirl, push. One more.

220
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:08,954
<i>Stop with that pushing!</i>
<i>I'm falling!</i>

221
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:16,712
<i>Help!</i>

222
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:23,010
<i>No, put me back in! Let go</i>
<i>of my head and put me back inside!</i>

223
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:25,262
It's a boy.

224
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,348
It's a boy.

225
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:33,770
<i>Who are you?</i>
<i>Lady, I'm freezing. I'm so cold.</i>

226
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:37,649
<i>Get that thing away from me.</i>

227
00:24:37,816 --> 00:24:41,987
- You want to do the cord?
- No, you take this one.

228
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:45,532
<i>I need that!</i>

229
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:50,621
<i>Lady, a blanket,</i>
<i>something, I'm frosty out here.</i>

230
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:57,377
<i>No, don't do that!</i>

231
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,427
<i>Where are we going now?</i>
<i>Hey, don't drop me.</i>

232
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:10,557
<i>Oh, very nice...</i>

233
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:21,860
<i>I don't know about you,</i>
<i>but I'm beat.</i>

234
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:25,822
So you're the one
that's been kicking me.

235
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:29,618
<i>You're the one</i>
<i>that ate the spicy food.</i>

236
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:38,043
<i>This is the weirdest thing that's</i>
<i>ever happened to</i> me... <i>so far.</i>

237
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:47,219
<i>I don't get it. I just don't</i>
<i>get it. Where did I go wrong?</i>

238
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:53,016
<i>Where are my thumbs?</i>
<i>I want to suck my thumbs.</i>

239
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:58,939
- <i>I have to get my own place.</i>
- <i>I've been reincarnated so quickly?</i>

240
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:02,568
<i>What a surprise!</i>

241
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:07,531
<i>Who stole my sucking thing?</i>
<i>I need my sucking thing!</i>

242
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:10,909
<i>I just remembered</i>
<i>I hate childhood.</i>

243
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:22,796
Look at all those daddies.

244
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:29,761
Making goofball faces
and taking pictures of their babies.

245
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:33,056
You won't find your father here.

246
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:37,060
I really messed things up for you.

247
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:42,524
Don't be upset.
I'm going to find you a daddy.

248
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:46,653
And not just some handsome guy
I'm in love with.

249
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:54,119
You're all that matters to me.
I'll get you the best daddy ever.

250
00:26:58,373 --> 00:27:05,464
<i>Out, down, in, out...</i>
<i>Well, we got that.</i>

251
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:09,051
What have you got there?
A hand?

252
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:12,262
<i>Yeah, two of them.</i>

253
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:23,315
Oh, my God!

254
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:34,034
"On the third or fourth day
your breasts may swell slightly."

255
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:38,872
Slightly?
I look like a Russ Meyer movie.

256
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:49,091
Workman.

257
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:54,346
- Oh, no! Sorry.
- Real nice.

258
00:27:56,139 --> 00:28:01,103
- You got your figure back.
- This is not my figure.

259
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,482
Sorry I hit you and yelled at you,
but I was in a lot of pain.

260
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:11,738
I still owe you that cab fare,
but somebody stole my purse.

261
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:16,410
- How do you like New York so far?
- <i>It's my kind of town.</i>

262
00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:22,374
I'll get you the rest later...
Wait a minute...

263
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:27,963
- How did you know where I lived?
- You left it in the cab.

264
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:31,425
Thanks.

265
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:36,722
You should look through that thing.
You've still got your diaphragm.

266
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:45,814
Don't smoke that around my baby.

267
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:51,361
There's a 62% higher rate of cancer
in people who live with smokers.

268
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:56,909
What are you trying to say?
You don't want me to move in yet?

269
00:28:57,075 --> 00:29:01,663
Do you think the drugs
had any effect on him?

270
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,168
- How did you know I had drugs?
- I don't. I didn't.

271
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:09,671
You can tell in his eyes.
He looks stoned.

272
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:17,596
- He does not. He looks perfect.
- You don't look so hot yourself.

273
00:29:17,763 --> 00:29:23,936
If you tried passing a watermelon,
how hot would you look?

274
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:28,482
Ouch! I should call
my mother more often. Get it?

275
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:33,570
- Do you want a sub?
- No, will you just watch him?

276
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:39,201
Don't take him out of his chair
and don't touch him a whole lot.

277
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:43,163
Hi, Mikey. I'm James.

278
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:49,586
- Good to meet you.
- <i>Do you mind if I suck on that?</i>

279
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:56,552
- How long have you been here?
- About five years.

280
00:29:56,718 --> 00:30:03,809
- Were you born in New York?
- Are you with the census bureau?

281
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:11,233
How do you like the outside world?
It's weird, isn't it?

282
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,406
- <i>Yeah, tell me about it.</i>
- Here, your first lesson in coffee.

283
00:30:17,573 --> 00:30:22,744
- Can you say black coffee?
- <i>No.</i>

284
00:30:22,911 --> 00:30:28,417
Regular coffee has two sugars and
milk... which they have forgotten.

285
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:35,757
Can I borrow some of yours?
Coffee regular, I love it.

286
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:39,386
That's breast milk.

287
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:44,600
- Why didn't you tell me?
- <i>You're on your own.</i>

288
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:47,853
I'll see you guys later.

289
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:54,610
I'm going to take my sub and
my breast milk and get out of here.

290
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:58,947
<i>I've got something</i>
<i>cold and wet in my shorts.</i>

291
00:30:59,114 --> 00:31:04,119
<i>Could you get somebody for me?</i>
<i>Fellas?</i>

292
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:10,709
<i>You guys are no help. I'm cold and</i>
<i>wet and there's nothing I can do.</i>

293
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:15,839
It's okay, Mikey. Mommy's here.

294
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:21,470
<i>That Mommy person's here again.</i>
<i>She's okay. I like her.</i>

295
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:28,519
<i>I start crying</i>
<i>and she comes in with a bottle.</i>

296
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:31,813
<i>Crying, I can handle that.</i>

297
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:17,818
Taxi!

298
00:32:20,863 --> 00:32:24,283
Taxi!

299
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:49,892
"80% of all women experience
post-partum depression."

300
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:52,144
I won't.

301
00:32:55,397 --> 00:33:01,320
<i>Like a lot of parents, I can't</i>
<i>always be there on birthdays.</i>

302
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:07,534
<i>Help, somebody burp me</i>
<i>before I blow up.</i>

303
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:16,043
That's it! You have some exotic
disease and I look like a zombie.

304
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,465
And your father deserted us so he
could pork his interior decorator.

305
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:25,844
I think you can safely say
that it can't get any worse.

306
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:30,891
- Hello!
- I was wrong.

307
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:36,104
Where's my grandson?

308
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:38,815
There he is.

309
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:47,115
- Mikey, do you know who I am?
- <i>No, actually, I don't.</i>

310
00:33:47,282 --> 00:33:52,120
- I'm your grandma.
- <i>Okay, if you say so.</i>

311
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:55,791
- Yes, I am.
- <i>What do you want from me?</i>

312
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:03,924
- Who's got a wet tushy?
- <i>I give up.</i>

313
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,183
<i>After a new diaper, I like</i>
<i>some of that white stuff on me.</i>

314
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:18,438
If you had a man instead of a frozen
pop, all this would be put together.

315
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:23,735
You make it sound like I had
an affair with a frozen dessert.

316
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:27,739
- You look awful.
- Thank you.

317
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:31,034
You're using too much powder.

318
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:37,541
Why don't you get out of the house?
I'm going to give Mikey a bath.

319
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,294
<i>A what?</i>

320
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:44,798
<i>She's gone!</i>

321
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,685
Who would you want
as your child's father?

322
00:34:56,852 --> 00:35:00,606
Someone with a small mouth
and good hair...

323
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:07,279
- A guy to help raise your child.
- Are there men who do that?

324
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:12,242
I'm looking for a guy
who's not married, -

325
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:17,498
- not into drugs, not a deadbeat,
but not a workaholic.

326
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:23,962
- And cute.
- Cute is of no importance.

327
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:26,924
You're my first date
since my baby was born.

328
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,719
This looks delicious.

329
00:35:30,886 --> 00:35:36,141
What is this?
I asked for well done. This is raw.

330
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:40,479
I asked for no dressing,
this is covered with slop.

331
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:46,610
Are you deaf or something?
Who do I have to kill to get a roll?

332
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:53,909
What's this "C" in algebra?
How many times did we go over it?

333
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,703
Are you an idiot?

334
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:04,169
Dating is difficult, but you've got
to take a chance in life sometime.

335
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:08,423
I'm not so sure about that.
Excuse me.

336
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:14,847
This fork and this plate are dirty,
and there's something in the water.

337
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:17,808
Check your water.

338
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:24,565
Mikey, what is this mess?
Sort out these socks.

339
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:29,194
Why are school shirts
mixed up with after-school shirts?

340
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:32,239
Straighten this up properly.

341
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:42,457
- Hi.
- Hey.

342
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,920
- Somebody call for a cab?
- Yeah, small world.

343
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:51,466
More mail for Vincent Ubriacco.
I don't even know this guy.

344
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:57,014
Let me have them. Put them up here,
the postman will take care of them.

345
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:03,729
- It's good seeing you again.
- You, too. See you.

346
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:11,653
- You're stealing my mail!
- I'm not stealing your mail.

347
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,699
- You put it in your pocket!
- These are mine.

348
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:21,205
- I sent them here. I'll explain.
- I'm going to call the police.

349
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:25,542
My grandfather Vincent
needs an old-age home -

350
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:31,840
- and there's a place in Manhattan,
but he needs to be a resident.

351
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:35,135
You want to use my mailing address?

352
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:41,099
I could have you arrested. Screwing
with the mail is a federal offence.

353
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:45,103
Stealing mail is,
not screwing with it.

354
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:50,776
- Can I get the other letters?
- No, I don't want to get involved.

355
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:55,739
I went out of my way
to bring you back your purse.

356
00:37:55,906 --> 00:38:01,370
Thank you very much,
but this happens to be illegal.

357
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:06,750
You're not going to get caught.
I'll do something for you, okay.

358
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,838
- I'll baby-sit.
- Come on...

359
00:38:11,004 --> 00:38:16,176
- You don't know about babies.
- My sister has kids.

360
00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:21,098
- I know a lot about babies.
- All right, Friday night.

361
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:26,895
- No can do, Friday's out.
- Then forget the whole deal.

362
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:32,693
- Okay, Friday, but that's it.
- And during my aerobics classes.

363
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,113
- One aerobics class.
- Saturday.

364
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,740
Can't do. I teach.

365
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:42,202
What do you teach?
Taxi driver's ed?

366
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:46,206
- That's not funny.
- Here's the deal.

367
00:38:46,373 --> 00:38:51,795
Friday nights, two aerobics classes,
and you can't bring chicks over.

368
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:56,633
You're pushing it.
All right, it's a deal.

369
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,803
- <i>Sucker.</i>
- Good.

370
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,266
- Don't force-feed him like that.
- I'm not!

371
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:09,813
- Why don't you take a nap?
- He doesn't need a nap.

372
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,610
- He knows when he's tired.
- <i>I'm not tired at all.</i>

373
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:19,406
If he doesn't take a nap -

374
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:24,495
- he will wake up and want
to eat when it's time to sleep.

375
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:28,332
- Who says?
- All those doctors.

376
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:33,378
- They just want to sell books.
- Dr. Spock is not like that.

377
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:38,592
Dr. Spock loves us. He protested
during the Vietnam war.

378
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:42,971
I'm sorry I said anything
about Dr. Spock.

379
00:39:43,138 --> 00:39:47,768
I can't believe she's getting
upset about a Vulcan.

380
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:54,733
- Have you got any other letters?
- They're in the hallway.

381
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,959
Mommy's asleep. Watch this.

382
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:44,366
What do you say you and me take
a ride so your mother can sleep?

383
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:50,956
- Is that a deal?
- <i>Just bring the milk.</i>

384
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:55,335
See that? That's my cab.

385
00:40:55,502 --> 00:41:00,174
I do this to make money,
but not for long.

386
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:08,182
Okay, this is called driving.

387
00:41:08,348 --> 00:41:12,561
When you get older,
I'll teach you how.

388
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:17,482
<i>First, you put the little stick</i>
<i>in the hole.</i>

389
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:22,029
<i>Then you move your foot</i>
<i>back and forth. Okay, what next?</i>

390
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:25,073
<i>You move the big circle around.</i>

391
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,620
<i>No problem, I can do this.</i>
<i>I can drive.</i>

392
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:55,187
- Hey.
- Hey, Jimmy.

393
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:58,649
That silver plane is a VJ-10.

394
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:01,860
That big plane is a Viscount.

395
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:06,073
- Hey, Carrie.
- What a sweetie.

396
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,827
- Is it yours?
- Yeah, but he needs a mother.

397
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:15,791
I'm kidding. Is this my schedule?

398
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:21,505
- There's nothing on it.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:26,635
<i>Do these things come in different</i>
<i>sizes? What are these, jumbos?</i>

400
00:42:26,802 --> 00:42:32,140
- What are you staring at?
- <i>Lunch.</i>

401
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:39,815
Mikey?

402
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:45,404
Mikey?

403
00:42:55,831 --> 00:43:00,961
I want to report a missing baby.

404
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:05,841
Maybe he was kidnapped,
or maybe he's with a complete idiot!

405
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:09,011
Hey, Grandpa.

406
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:11,763
That's Grandpa.

407
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,058
Do I know you?

408
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,820
- Jimmy!
- Grandpa.

409
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:32,201
- I don't remember your baby.
- It's a friend of mine's.

410
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:37,039
- You sure it isn't yours?
- <i>I've got more teeth than him.</i>

411
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:41,835
<i>What are those hairy jobs</i>
<i>over your eyes?</i>

412
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:46,673
<i>Let me see those things.</i>
<i>There we go. How does that feel?</i>

413
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,845
- Mikey, lay off him.
- <i>What a crack-up.</i>

414
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:56,016
- Honey, I'm home.
- <i>Me, too.</i>

415
00:43:56,183 --> 00:44:03,565
- Hey, you're up.
- My baby! Honey, honey...

416
00:44:03,732 --> 00:44:06,860
Mommy and her baby...

417
00:44:08,654 --> 00:44:13,200
Idiot! I called the police.
I was worried out of my mind.

418
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:18,497
- You knew I was with him.
- You might be a kidnapper.

419
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:23,752
- I was baby-sitting for you.
- That means the baby stays here!

420
00:44:23,919 --> 00:44:26,880
Damn it! I got a splinter.

421
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:30,092
Let me see it.

422
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:34,680
- Have you got a needle?
- In there.

423
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:40,060
Sit down.

424
00:44:41,854 --> 00:44:43,939
Oh, stop.

425
00:44:44,106 --> 00:44:48,569
If you don't hold still,
I can't do this. It doesn't hurt.

426
00:44:48,735 --> 00:44:52,322
It hurts. Don't do it that way.

427
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:57,494
- You're poking me!
- Hold still while I get it out.

428
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:01,874
- It can't hurt that much.
- How would you know?

429
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:08,380
- Look at that. That's a big one.
- I've never had one that big in me.

430
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:16,221
- All better.
- Mikey needs a nap.

431
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:23,687
Mikey, I've got to go.
See you.

432
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:31,904
Ready? High-five.
Low-five. Baby-five. Bye.

433
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:37,868
- Bye.
- My little angel-head.

434
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:48,837
- Mollie, who was that?
- The babysitter.

435
00:45:49,004 --> 00:45:54,635
The babysitter?
He's not the frozen pop, is he?

436
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:58,764
- Ma!
- All right, give me the baby.

437
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:13,088
- Ma...
- What?

438
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:18,343
- You ever get bored with Daddy?
- How can I get bored with Daddy?

439
00:47:27,102 --> 00:47:29,938
Mikey needs a father.

440
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:35,110
- I just can't find the right guy.
- Mikey will like whoever you like.

441
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:39,948
- I don't like anybody.
- You know what the secret is?

442
00:47:40,115 --> 00:47:45,871
Find someone you have something
in common with, like Daddy and me.

443
00:47:46,038 --> 00:47:52,377
We both like to go to the movies.
I know someone perfect for you.

444
00:47:52,544 --> 00:48:01,220
He's in Daddy's firm. He's handsome
and smart. You'll love him.

445
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:06,183
Hello! Rosie didn't tell me
you were beautiful.

446
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:10,854
I'm surprised, that's usually
the first thing she says.

447
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,232
Come on in.

448
00:48:13,398 --> 00:48:19,655
This is my son Michael. I'll get
dressed. Make yourself comfortable.

449
00:48:19,822 --> 00:48:23,951
- Hi, little guy.
- <i>Who's this yutz?</i>

450
00:48:24,117 --> 00:48:27,746
Are you watching some TV?

451
00:48:27,913 --> 00:48:32,251
<i>Don't touch that.</i>
<i>I don't want to watch football.</i>

452
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:37,047
<i>Hey, it's the bear show.</i>
<i>Look at that.</i>

453
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:43,053
- Leave it on football.
- <i>Leave it alone.</i>

454
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,391
- <i>That guy's a good actor.</i>
- Cut it out. It's the play-offs!

455
00:48:51,812 --> 00:48:54,148
<i>You dick.</i>

456
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:03,198
- Baby! Hot mama!
- You're such a goofball.

457
00:49:03,365 --> 00:49:07,369
- Don't I look good?
- You look slightly cute.

458
00:49:07,536 --> 00:49:11,832
- What are you all dressed up for?
- I've got a hot date.

459
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:15,794
You'd better call her.
I'm going to be late.

460
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:20,591
Yeah, right. You've got a date
with an accountant. 9:30 tops.

461
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:24,553
- Don't count on it.
- Besides, my woman will wait.

462
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,974
Harry, this is the babysitter.
I'll just get my coat.

463
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:34,980
- I'm just watching the game here.
- Yeah, I've got money on this game.

464
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:39,735
So you're an accountant?
You and Mollie will get along great.

465
00:49:39,902 --> 00:49:44,490
- She's a CPA.
- I know, her mom told me.

466
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:48,535
It's got to be tough
being a mom and a CPA.

467
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:55,417
But Mollie is tough. She hates it
when guys open doors for her -

468
00:49:55,584 --> 00:50:00,255
- or pick up the tab.
It really pisses her off.

469
00:50:00,422 --> 00:50:05,344
- She's liberated?
- Come on. A guy babysitter?

470
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:10,807
Come here, Mikey.
Say bye-bye to Mama.

471
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:14,895
- Do this.
- Jeez!

472
00:50:15,062 --> 00:50:19,149
Give it back.
This is really embarrassing.

473
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,820
May I just say one thing?

474
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:26,532
- You look better without it.
- I think so, too.

475
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:29,535
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

476
00:50:29,701 --> 00:50:34,581
- All right, I'll leave it off.
- Great.

477
00:50:36,124 --> 00:50:41,547
Bye-bye. See you.
Mikey, high-five.

478
00:50:41,713 --> 00:50:45,384
- Yeah, all right.
- <i>Who was that clown?</i>

479
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,265
It was very uncomfortable.

480
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:57,229
A kind of bloated, gassy...
belchy sensation.

481
00:50:57,563 --> 00:51:02,734
I'd sit down in the bathroom...
and nothing would happen.

482
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,821
Nothing would come out.

483
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:11,368
I called my doctor about two...

484
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,830
...three weeks after this started.

485
00:51:14,997 --> 00:51:20,878
He said I'd better come in
and have an ultrasound.

486
00:51:21,753 --> 00:51:25,507
- What was I saying?
- Ultrasound.

487
00:51:25,674 --> 00:51:30,429
So I went in for the ultrasound
and they checked it out.

488
00:51:30,596 --> 00:51:35,934
It wasn't gallstones.
They didn't know what it was.

489
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:42,065
The doctor said I'd better have
an upper G. I. So I went in again.

490
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:47,154
- Have you ever had a barium enema?
- Not recently.

491
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:51,325
It's disgusting,
but I did get to see my colon on TV.

492
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:57,623
Is it true that colons
look 10 pounds heavier on TV?

493
00:51:57,873 --> 00:51:59,917
How so?

494
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:08,383
<i>They never do that for me.</i>

495
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:22,564
Get on my knee.

496
00:52:29,488 --> 00:52:33,700
- <i>Hold it. Okay.</i>
- Get down, Mikey.

497
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:41,416
<i>Yeah, I can do that.</i>

498
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:46,755
Let's walk.

499
00:52:51,009 --> 00:52:53,887
<i>I'm dancing. I'm bad.</i>

500
00:52:54,054 --> 00:52:57,474
- <i>Check me out now.</i>
- Jump.

501
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:05,149
Hey, can I get paid?

502
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:20,581
Two, please.

503
00:53:25,627 --> 00:53:28,964
Are you ready?

504
00:53:32,801 --> 00:53:36,638
<i>I'm gonna throw up,</i>
<i>but I like it!</i>

505
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:39,933
Okay, shake it up.

506
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:44,521
Right on.

507
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:51,028
Ready? Shake it, Mikey.

508
00:53:52,738 --> 00:53:56,200
Let's go.

509
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:02,873
Aeroplane.

510
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:07,753
Mikey's a plane.
Look at that boy.

511
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,257
All right.

512
00:54:15,594 --> 00:54:18,722
Finally, I passed the stone.

513
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:22,935
It's the most excruciating thing
you can have, next to giving birth.

514
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:26,730
- I had a really good time tonight.
- I bet you did.

515
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:34,029
A lot of guys would feel threatened
by a woman always wanting to pay.

516
00:54:34,196 --> 00:54:37,616
- What?
- Your babysitter told me.

517
00:54:37,783 --> 00:54:40,619
- He did, did he?
- Yeah.

518
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:45,207
- Come here.
- No, I really have to go up.

519
00:54:45,374 --> 00:54:51,421
- Come on, Mollie, it's early.
- Yeah, but I'm broke.

520
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,216
Jerk.

521
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:03,600
Shit!

522
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:21,118
I'm home.

523
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:26,290
You can go on your date now.

524
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:57,946
- <i>Hey, Mikey!</i>
- <i>Sarah, how are you doing?</i>

525
00:55:58,113 --> 00:56:01,241
- <i>I want to talk to you.</i>
- <i>Sorry, got to go.</i>

526
00:56:03,785 --> 00:56:06,997
<i>Right back at you, babe.</i>

527
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:13,629
- <i>Hiya, Mickey.</i>
- <i>Look at that hat.</i>

528
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:20,135
- <i>Megan, good to see you.</i>
- <i>Mikey, where've you been?</i>

529
00:56:20,302 --> 00:56:24,640
- <i>Did you get your hair cut?</i>
- <i>Yeah, what do you think?</i>

530
00:56:24,806 --> 00:56:28,685
<i>I hate it.</i>
<i>My mother did it herself.</i>

531
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,564
<i>It looks great.</i>

532
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:35,859
<i>I used to have curls at the end.</i>

533
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:39,988
- <i>I remember.</i>
- <i>I was the one with the cute curls.</i>

534
00:56:40,155 --> 00:56:44,743
- <i>Now they're gone.</i>
- <i>You're still cute.</i>

535
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:49,832
- <i>I look like a boy. No offence.</i>
- <i>Nice talking to you.</i>

536
00:56:54,711 --> 00:57:01,218
<i>How many babies does it take</i>
<i>to screw in a light bulb?</i>

537
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:07,224
- <i>How many?</i>
- <i>What's a light bulb?</i>

538
00:57:09,017 --> 00:57:12,396
<i>I don't get it.</i>

539
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:16,942
<i>Where's she going?</i>
<i>Who's that big guy?</i>

540
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:23,198
- <i>Who is he?</i>
- <i>That's okay. That's her daddy.</i>

541
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:26,326
<i>What's a daddy? What do they do?</i>

542
00:57:26,493 --> 00:57:31,582
<i>The big men types</i>
<i>who hang around with the mommies.</i>

543
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:35,419
<i>I get it. Maybe I'll ask James</i>
<i>to be my daddy.</i>

544
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:49,057
<i>We'll eat all the pudding now...</i>

545
00:57:51,894 --> 00:57:56,440
- <i>I still ain't eating it.</i>
- Yummy.

546
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:04,406
All right, don't look at Mommy.

547
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,715
<i>You've got to love her.</i>

548
00:58:40,025 --> 00:58:43,654
Watch this, Mikey.

549
00:58:52,704 --> 00:58:57,709
- <i>Now that's entertainment.</i>
- Not in front of Mikey.

550
00:58:57,876 --> 00:59:02,965
- Look at the look on his face.
- He looks like his father.

551
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:06,593
You said
you were artificially inseminated.

552
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,807
I was, but I never make that face.
I assume his father does.

553
00:59:11,974 --> 00:59:16,103
You know what I thought
you'd enjoy doing today?

554
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:21,316
- Go to my grandfather's new home.
- You thought I'd enjoy that?

555
00:59:21,483 --> 00:59:26,405
Yeah, you'd enjoy it...
Maybe you'd sign a few papers.

556
00:59:26,572 --> 00:59:31,285
You are such a baby. If you want me
to do something, just ask.

557
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:37,332
Would you please come with me
to sign these papers?

558
00:59:37,499 --> 00:59:41,587
- That's how you handle a woman.
- <i>Really?</i>

559
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:50,804
You want to go to lunch
at North Eastern Life Insurance?

560
00:59:50,971 --> 00:59:55,225
- Employees get free lunches.
- We'll get caught.

561
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:59,438
I must know 20 ways
to get a free lunch in this town.

562
00:59:59,605 --> 01:00:02,733
- You do this a lot?
- Sure.

563
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:09,364
I don't pay for L. D.'s, either.
Long distance phone calls.

564
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:12,618
I go up to a company receptionist.

565
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:19,875
I pretend I'm a lost messenger,
and they let me use their phone.

566
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:25,506
I wouldn't be driving this cab
if I made more instructing.

567
01:00:25,672 --> 01:00:31,220
- What do flight instructors make?
- If I hustle, about 1, 100...

568
01:00:31,386 --> 01:00:37,309
...a month.
But I get to accumulate air time.

569
01:00:40,229 --> 01:00:45,484
- Give me my bag!
- He's not stealing our bags.

570
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:49,696
- I've got my teeth in there.
- They're coming with us.

571
01:00:49,863 --> 01:00:53,617
Tell him not to touch my teeth.

572
01:00:57,412 --> 01:01:01,375
Welcome, gramps.

573
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:06,880
- Are we stopping for a bite to eat?
- No, this is your new place.

574
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:11,009
- They got good shrimp here?
- And lobster.

575
01:01:11,176 --> 01:01:14,888
This is it. Enjoy your stay.

576
01:01:15,055 --> 01:01:18,225
Grandpa, this is great.

577
01:01:18,392 --> 01:01:23,730
You've got a terrific view.
No roommate to bug you. Television.

578
01:01:23,897 --> 01:01:26,817
Can I talk to you for a minute?

579
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:32,489
He's got a sweet tooth.
Give him one candy bar a day.

580
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:39,121
- Just don't let him find the bag.
- No problem.

581
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:41,456
That smells good.

582
01:01:41,623 --> 01:01:47,963
- Grandpa, that smells good.
- I'd like to see you eat it.

583
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:50,799
Watch this.

584
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:56,972
Let me try that.

585
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:03,312
- What do you want?
- Mollie helped us get this place.

586
01:02:03,479 --> 01:02:09,985
The woman has thousands more nerves
in the sexual organs than the man.

587
01:02:10,152 --> 01:02:15,282
- I bet the kid's not even yours.
- That's it! Be nice.

588
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:22,623
<i>He's worse at this than I am.</i>
<i>Let me give you a hand.</i>

589
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:26,001
<i>Come on, taste it.</i>

590
01:02:26,168 --> 01:02:28,128
<i>Open wide.</i>

591
01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:35,135
- Thank you for helping me.
- You're welcome.

592
01:02:35,302 --> 01:02:39,264
- You want to go flying?
- That would be way too expensive.

593
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:45,187
- Maintenance flights are free.
- You get everything for free.

594
01:02:45,354 --> 01:02:50,025
Free phone calls, free lunches...
You're a scam artist.

595
01:02:50,192 --> 01:02:56,573
I've got the town wired. If we were
poor, we'd still live like kings.

596
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,577
- Fly with me.
- I'm not that kind of person.

597
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:05,541
- Come on. Are you scared?
- No, I'm not scared!

598
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:11,421
- Where are the parachutes?
- There are no parachutes.

599
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:17,177
Didn't you ever see
"The Buddy Holly Story", "La Bamba"?

600
01:03:17,344 --> 01:03:22,099
There's one big difference.
They were rock legends. You're not.

601
01:03:24,393 --> 01:03:28,438
- Is your wing smoking?
- No... Oh, my God!

602
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:33,569
- It was just a joke to relax you.
- I'm just so nervous.

603
01:03:33,735 --> 01:03:36,655
I feel so out of control.

604
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:42,911
I'll give you your first lesson.
Put your hand on my stick.

605
01:03:43,078 --> 01:03:47,916
- I'm not touching your stick.
- This is not a sexual thing.

606
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:50,794
That feels good, baby.

607
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:54,965
Get familiar with the stick.

608
01:03:55,132 --> 01:04:00,262
- There you go, you're flying.
- I'm flying!

609
01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:06,518
I'm doing a good job. This is easy!
What a good sensation!

610
01:04:06,685 --> 01:04:12,524
- It's like great sex, isn't it?
- I personally wouldn't remember.

611
01:04:12,858 --> 01:04:17,571
- He's pretty tired.
- He's had a busy day.

612
01:04:21,408 --> 01:04:27,039
- Do you want a drink?
- Do you want to watch a movie?

613
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,055
Stop it!

614
01:05:25,264 --> 01:05:30,644
Stop yelling or your father will
give you something to yell about.

615
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:34,565
Knock it off!

616
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:39,820
Princess,
you're making my mouth water.

617
01:05:39,987 --> 01:05:42,197
I'm hungry.

618
01:05:42,364 --> 01:05:48,495
Hold your horses, or I'll knock you
from here to kingdom come.

619
01:05:48,662 --> 01:05:53,083
You know that dumpster behind
the supermarket? Look what I found.

620
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:58,922
A perfectly good head of lettuce,
just peel off the outer layers.

621
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:05,304
Who wants a surprise?
Could be lunch meat or peaches.

622
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:11,351
The point is this: Just because
it's free, don't mean it's no good.

623
01:06:11,518 --> 01:06:17,024
- Do we live like kings, or what?
- We sure do.

624
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,077
Again!

625
01:06:29,244 --> 01:06:32,331
Wait a minute.

626
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:36,668
- I'm sorry, I really do want this.
- I do, too.

627
01:06:36,835 --> 01:06:39,421
- It's Mikey.
- He's asleep.

628
01:06:39,588 --> 01:06:46,470
I have to be very clear
on the choices I make for him.

629
01:06:46,637 --> 01:06:53,644
I can't make any more mistakes
that are going to hurt Mikey.

630
01:06:53,811 --> 01:06:59,566
- But I'm crazy about Mikey.
- I know that I was leading you on.

631
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:03,987
You're such a good kisser and
I haven't had sex in a long time...

632
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:09,618
Goodbye. Please... Goodbye.

633
01:07:09,785 --> 01:07:15,791
- Mollie, could I talk to you?
- Hold just a minute, please.

634
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:21,255
Just between you and me,
what's with you and Chubby Charles?

635
01:07:21,421 --> 01:07:24,132
What do you mean?

636
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:29,012
Pearlman's doing the bank recs.
Rubenstein's doing the quarterlies.

637
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:33,809
Now Albert's returns are due.
So what's with you?

638
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:40,274
I traded Rubenstein two accounts
for the Chubby Charles account.

639
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,652
I can't do it anymore...
It's personal.

640
01:07:43,819 --> 01:07:48,365
We're accountants...
we're not personal.

641
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:52,411
- I don't...
- You've worked for him for years.

642
01:07:52,578 --> 01:07:55,914
Now, with all the new tax laws,
you desert him.

643
01:07:56,081 --> 01:08:00,419
- You don't understand...
- I want you up there tomorrow.

644
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:06,884
Don't give me that look.
And you, get back to work.

645
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:16,185
Please, give me a second chance.
This has been like a bad dream.

646
01:08:16,351 --> 01:08:19,730
I felt so guilty
leaving Beth and the girls.

647
01:08:19,897 --> 01:08:26,612
You've been such an asshole,
I'd have to torture you.

648
01:08:26,778 --> 01:08:30,407
That's okay. I want you to.

649
01:08:30,574 --> 01:08:34,119
- Mollie, Mollie...
- What?

650
01:08:34,286 --> 01:08:38,415
- I'll burst if I don't kiss you.
- Tough!

651
01:08:43,045 --> 01:08:46,798
Albert can see you now.

652
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:56,308
- Mollie, how's Mickey?
- Mikey.

653
01:08:56,475 --> 01:08:59,520
- Is he talking yet?
- No.

654
01:08:59,686 --> 01:09:03,607
Crawling?
I remember Astrid crawling...

655
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:07,486
I'm not interested in your stories.

656
01:09:07,653 --> 01:09:14,368
- I've been meaning to talk to you.
- I'm here to do your taxes.

657
01:09:16,537 --> 01:09:20,499
Eyelash tinting,
body wraps, facials...

658
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:25,629
- You can't deduct any of this crap.
- And the exercise instructor?

659
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:33,220
Not unless she suffered any injury.
What's the little woman been up to?

660
01:09:33,387 --> 01:09:37,891
Is Priscilla sick?
These doctor bills are for her.

661
01:09:38,058 --> 01:09:41,311
Therapy.
Beth communicaes with the dead.

662
01:09:41,478 --> 01:09:44,731
It really frightens Priscilla.

663
01:09:44,898 --> 01:09:50,863
We're all seeing a psychiatrist now.
I've been learning a lot.

664
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:55,868
- I'm happy for you, Albert.
- I know you've been through a lot.

665
01:09:56,034 --> 01:10:01,915
You've got to believe I love you.
I never meant for this to go bad.

666
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:07,337
- It just turned out that way.
- It took $20,000 to find that out?

667
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:12,718
- Do you have a picture of Mickey?
- Mikey!

668
01:10:12,885 --> 01:10:16,889
- I think about you two every day.
- You'd never know it.

669
01:10:17,055 --> 01:10:20,684
I try to call, but I can't do it.

670
01:10:20,851 --> 01:10:25,564
I'm too ashamed.
I'm afraid of what you'll say.

671
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:29,359
I've been so confused.

672
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:44,208
- He has my eyes.
- I know.

673
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:49,004
It's confusing loving someone
who looks like someone you hate.

674
01:10:49,171 --> 01:10:51,507
Could I see him?

675
01:10:54,968 --> 01:10:59,264
All right.
I'll be home this evening.

676
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:04,561
Next time you talk to your mom,
put in a good word in for me.

677
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:07,564
<i>Hit me. Hit it again.</i>

678
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:11,026
- No... yeah?
- <i>Hit it again.</i>

679
01:11:11,193 --> 01:11:16,740
- <i>I know what I'm doing.</i>
- Damn! You won again.

680
01:11:16,907 --> 01:11:22,871
<i>I told you I could play. I've been</i>
<i>thinking about this daddy business.</i>

681
01:11:23,038 --> 01:11:26,583
<i>I want you to be my daddy.</i>
<i>I'll tell Mommy.</i>

682
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:32,214
- Who is it?
- Mollie?

683
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:40,013
- Is Mollie here?
- No, she's at aerobics class.

684
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:46,061
- Is Mikey here? I'm his father.
- His father?

685
01:11:46,228 --> 01:11:50,649
- Are you the sperm donor?
- I'm the kid's father?

686
01:11:50,816 --> 01:11:56,905
- He's from artificial insemination.
- I've known Mollie for years.

687
01:11:57,072 --> 01:12:00,659
- I have a key.
- We're changing it.

688
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:05,664
- What?
- That's my kid in there. Let me by.

689
01:12:05,831 --> 01:12:09,710
If you are the father,
answer me a few questions.

690
01:12:09,877 --> 01:12:14,756
- When was he born?
- July third.

691
01:12:14,923 --> 01:12:18,594
What's his favourite toy,
Fred or Barney? Fred?

692
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:23,932
No, Barney. How many diapers
does he go through a day? Six.

693
01:12:24,099 --> 01:12:28,687
- A father should know.
- How much is she paying you?

694
01:12:28,854 --> 01:12:32,816
- Go play some video games.
- Don't give me that shit.

695
01:12:34,776 --> 01:12:39,072
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

696
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:43,327
<i>Go for the body!</i>

697
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:52,169
Get out of here!

698
01:12:54,922 --> 01:12:59,009
Yes, that feels good.

699
01:13:04,515 --> 01:13:09,269
- What happened?
- Who's Albert?

700
01:13:09,436 --> 01:13:14,024
- Why, was he here?
- Is he Mikey's father?

701
01:13:15,651 --> 01:13:21,198
- You lied about the insemination.
- He was married.

702
01:13:21,365 --> 01:13:26,245
Do you love him?

703
01:13:26,411 --> 01:13:29,873
- What?
- Do you love him?

704
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,043
I don't know who I love.

705
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:37,881
The only thing that matters to me
is who's best for Mikey.

706
01:13:38,048 --> 01:13:45,305
Albert is successful, responsible
and he's good to his other kids.

707
01:13:45,472 --> 01:13:51,103
- I don't want him seeing Mikey.
- Don't start pulling this on me.

708
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:56,275
- He has a right to see his son.
- Where has he been all year?

709
01:13:56,441 --> 01:14:02,114
- You are not his father.
- I'm the closest thing he's got.

710
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:05,826
Look at you. You're like a big kid.

711
01:14:05,993 --> 01:14:10,914
Are you responsible enough
to be a father?

712
01:14:11,081 --> 01:14:14,710
Is getting pregnant by a married man
responsible?

713
01:14:14,877 --> 01:14:17,671
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

714
01:14:17,838 --> 01:14:23,886
I've seen you use Mikey to push guys
away, and now you're doing it to me.

715
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:28,307
- Get out!
- I live here!

716
01:14:35,481 --> 01:14:40,152
Can a person past
a certain age change?

717
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,988
Daddy's lipids fell to 185.

718
01:14:43,155 --> 01:14:48,410
I'm not talking about cholesterol.
Can someone become nicer?

719
01:14:48,577 --> 01:14:50,787
I don't know.

720
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:55,417
When you met Daddy at that dance,
did you know he'd be a good father?

721
01:14:55,584 --> 01:15:01,882
- I liked the look of his uniform.
- They all wore uniforms.

722
01:15:02,049 --> 01:15:05,260
I didn't like
the sailors' bell-bottoms.

723
01:15:05,427 --> 01:15:11,809
You had no idea if he was
a mature responsible person.

724
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:17,606
If I thought like that, we wouldn't
have had so much fun the first week.

725
01:15:17,773 --> 01:15:23,237
You're grossing me out.
Don't talk about sex and Daddy.

726
01:15:24,488 --> 01:15:27,950
<i>Hi, Lupe.</i>

727
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:32,579
<i>I just want to talk to Mikey</i>
<i>for a minute.</i>

728
01:15:34,081 --> 01:15:38,043
Hey, Gerber-face, high-five.

729
01:15:40,754 --> 01:15:46,510
Look, Mikey... I don't know
if I can keep coming to see you.

730
01:15:46,677 --> 01:15:50,013
- <i>What's the matter?</i>
- It's your mom.

731
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:54,935
She's got this crazy idea
that I wouldn't make a good father.

732
01:15:55,102 --> 01:15:59,815
She probably wouldn't
have picked my father, either.

733
01:15:59,982 --> 01:16:06,405
I think he did an okay job.
Want to hear some fatherly advice?

734
01:16:07,614 --> 01:16:11,702
Hi, Lupe.

735
01:16:11,869 --> 01:16:18,876
- <i>The man's in the baby's room.</i>
- Okay, I'll write you a check.

736
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:25,215
He said, "Don't hit girls,
even if they're asking for it."

737
01:16:25,382 --> 01:16:27,593
<i>What about pushing them?</i>

738
01:16:27,759 --> 01:16:35,559
<i>He'd say, "Finish your meat,</i>
<i>you know how much that cost? "</i>

739
01:16:35,726 --> 01:16:41,440
The one that sticks out the most
was probably...

740
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:46,570
"If your friend jumps off a bridge,
does that mean you've got to?"

741
01:16:46,737 --> 01:16:53,452
To this very day,
I still use that piece of advice.

742
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:57,915
It doesn't amount to much.

743
01:16:58,081 --> 01:17:05,839
A good father keeps the mother happy
so she doesn't drive the kids crazy.

744
01:17:06,006 --> 01:17:10,135
<i>She called me a big kid...</i>
<i>She's probably right.</i>

745
01:17:10,302 --> 01:17:14,473
<i>You're one year old</i>
<i>and my best friend in the world.</i>

746
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,393
Anyway...

747
01:17:20,854 --> 01:17:25,442
- I'll miss you.
- <i>Don't be sad. Here, take this.</i>

748
01:17:30,781 --> 01:17:37,329
- <i>No, I want you to have it.</i>
- Okay, thanks.

749
01:17:37,496 --> 01:17:41,041
<i>He'll take good care of you.</i>

750
01:17:46,296 --> 01:17:50,843
- We're going to see Daddy today.
- <i>I was just thinking about James.</i>

751
01:17:51,009 --> 01:17:57,141
- The blue or the lamb?
- <i>They both look pretty lame.</i>

752
01:17:57,307 --> 01:18:01,103
- The lamb?
- <i>Not lamb, lame!</i>

753
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:05,774
<i>Please don't make me wear clothes</i>
<i>with animals on them.</i>

754
01:18:05,941 --> 01:18:10,445
<i>I don't like this.</i>
<i>It makes me look stupid.</i>

755
01:18:10,612 --> 01:18:16,118
- You look great.
- <i>I feel like a retard.</i>

756
01:18:19,955 --> 01:18:23,667
<i>Look at this room.</i>
<i>Look at these guys.</i>

757
01:18:23,834 --> 01:18:27,171
<i>I bet I could take those apart.</i>

758
01:18:27,337 --> 01:18:32,843
<i>Little metal things... I'll stick</i>
<i>them in those little holes.</i>

759
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:39,141
Mollie, hi. This must be Mikey.

760
01:18:39,308 --> 01:18:44,480
Hiya, fella. What are you doing?

761
01:18:44,646 --> 01:18:48,901
- Aren't you a handsome...
- <i>Milk in the eye.</i>

762
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:51,361
<i>Bull's-eye!</i>

763
01:18:51,528 --> 01:18:56,658
It's all right.
It's just milk, it won't stain.

764
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:04,458
- He's beautiful. He looks like you.
- A lot of people say that.

765
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:10,088
I know the circumstances
you had him under were terrible.

766
01:19:10,255 --> 01:19:15,260
- But I know it wasn't a mistake.
- I bet he's glad to hear that.

767
01:19:15,427 --> 01:19:19,640
<i>You will never escape me.</i>

768
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:23,769
- Mikey, don't do that!
- <i>What did I do?</i>

769
01:19:23,936 --> 01:19:31,610
Some people don't have the strength
to get out certain situations.

770
01:19:31,777 --> 01:19:35,864
What are you trying to say?
Mikey, don't touch that.

771
01:19:36,031 --> 01:19:42,246
I'm saying I still love you
and I still want you.

772
01:19:42,412 --> 01:19:48,627
- And what about Mikey?
- Count on me. Whatever he needs.

773
01:19:49,711 --> 01:19:52,214
He needs a father.

774
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:58,637
I'm living alone for the first time
in 17 years. I'm in therapy.

775
01:19:58,804 --> 01:20:04,268
I can't be anybody's father now.
I need to be by myself.

776
01:20:04,434 --> 01:20:09,857
- I've raised my kids.
- Raised them? They're 11 and 9!

777
01:20:10,023 --> 01:20:14,987
- Have they moved out?
- <i>Too much fruit!</i>

778
01:20:15,154 --> 01:20:19,616
It wouldn't be fair to Mikey.

779
01:20:19,783 --> 01:20:24,246
- Is he taking a dump?
- No, he's thinking real hard.

780
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:33,088
- I'll get you cleaned up.
- Use the washroom in the back.

781
01:20:33,255 --> 01:20:39,178
- He'll ask about his daddy.
- <i>I want James to be the daddy.</i>

782
01:20:39,344 --> 01:20:44,558
Don't do that here.
That's a $10,000 desk!

783
01:20:44,725 --> 01:20:49,563
- Now it's junk!
- I thought you'd understand.

784
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:56,737
Of course I understand. You're going
through a selfish phase.

785
01:20:56,904 --> 01:21:01,950
I know you will understand that I'm
going through a destructive phase.

786
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:09,958
<i>Let's trash the place.</i>

787
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:20,677
I'm sorry about that stupid outfit.

788
01:21:20,844 --> 01:21:26,016
I'm sorry I made you meet
that mean man. Never again.

789
01:21:26,183 --> 01:21:32,189
Every time I take you someplace,
people are crazy about you.

790
01:21:32,356 --> 01:21:38,195
Yet the person who has a genetic
bond to you treats you like a jerk.

791
01:21:38,362 --> 01:21:42,366
Everybody loves you.
All the kids at the playground.

792
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:45,577
Ma loves you. Rona loves you.

793
01:21:45,744 --> 01:21:51,124
James loves you.
Mikey, do you love James?

794
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:59,216
- <i>Give him a call.</i>
- Do you want to play telephone?

795
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:02,261
Hello?

796
01:22:02,427 --> 01:22:07,599
It's for you. You take this one,
I'll take the other one.

797
01:22:07,766 --> 01:22:13,063
<i>This is Lou Franklin,</i>
<i>I'm phoning about your grandfather.</i>

798
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:17,109
He's become abusive and violent.

799
01:22:17,276 --> 01:22:22,906
- <i>Should I call Health & Welfare?</i>
- No, I'll come and pick him up.

800
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:37,171
- What's going on?
- I'm a hostage.

801
01:22:37,337 --> 01:22:40,340
He's a mean old bastard!

802
01:22:40,507 --> 01:22:44,761
- Look what he did to my arm?
- Don't talk to him like that.

803
01:22:44,928 --> 01:22:48,765
- They're hiding Dora.
- They are not.

804
01:22:48,932 --> 01:22:54,938
- Then where is she?
- Sit down. I'll find her for you.

805
01:22:55,105 --> 01:23:01,028
Let's get your face cleaned up.
You want to look good for her.

806
01:23:01,862 --> 01:23:07,868
You're my favourite daughter-in-law.
You're smart and a good person.

807
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:12,915
That's why Jimmy loves you so much.

808
01:23:15,501 --> 01:23:20,214
- There you go.
- <i>Let's go find James.</i>

809
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:24,551
I'll show you some pictures.

810
01:23:25,594 --> 01:23:30,474
Grandpa, did you eat all these
candy bars today?

811
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:35,145
- The bastards stole my candy.
- We'll get some more.

812
01:23:35,312 --> 01:23:39,024
- Where's the director's office?
- Down the hall.

813
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:43,487
- We're busy.
- I'll keep my eye on them for you.

814
01:23:43,654 --> 01:23:47,241
I'll be back in a minute.

815
01:23:47,407 --> 01:23:54,540
This isn't his usual behaviour.
My husband made arrangements.

816
01:23:54,706 --> 01:23:59,336
It isn't the orderly's
responsibility to control his diet.

817
01:23:59,503 --> 01:24:02,798
He requires a private nurse.

818
01:24:02,965 --> 01:24:12,474
No, he doesn't. The orderly was told
to give him one candy bar a day.

819
01:24:12,641 --> 01:24:16,603
- He said no problem.
- That was Bill.

820
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:22,401
Bill always says no problem.
The man can't speak English.

821
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:28,115
- So can Grandpa stay?
- Of course.

822
01:24:28,282 --> 01:24:34,872
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming down so fast.

823
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:41,336
- Hi.
- Hi.

824
01:24:41,503 --> 01:24:47,384
- Your grandfather can stay.
- You didn't have to do that.

825
01:24:47,551 --> 01:24:52,723
- I wanted to do it.
- Let me give you a ride home.

826
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:55,309
- Don't bother.
- Fine!

827
01:24:55,476 --> 01:25:00,063
D.J., it's time for lunch.
Let's go.

828
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:04,526
- Are you okay with him?
- Get the hell out of here.

829
01:25:06,612 --> 01:25:10,991
Steven and Paulie,
they're your cousins.

830
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:17,039
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello, Esther.

831
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:26,965
Esther... I'd like you
to meet my grandson.

832
01:25:28,091 --> 01:25:31,595
<i>Hey, there goes James.</i>

833
01:25:31,762 --> 01:25:36,558
<i>Where's he going?</i>
<i>Maybe he's going downstairs.</i>

834
01:25:36,725 --> 01:25:42,105
- They took me to the beauty salon.
- <i>Where's the elevator.</i>

835
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:45,484
<i>Going down.</i>

836
01:25:45,651 --> 01:25:49,321
<i>I'll just press all these.</i>

837
01:25:50,697 --> 01:25:55,452
<i>Perfect! I'll just hitch a ride</i>
<i>with the fruit cups.</i>

838
01:25:58,247 --> 01:26:02,125
<i>There we go. Take her away, boys.</i>

839
01:26:03,919 --> 01:26:08,173
- Mikey.
- Grandpa, where's Mikey?

840
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:14,721
- He was just here.
- How long ago did he leave?

841
01:26:14,888 --> 01:26:18,976
- I'll check the hallway.
- I'm calling the police.

842
01:26:20,394 --> 01:26:23,480
<i>Hi, toots. Anyone seen my dad?</i>

843
01:26:23,647 --> 01:26:29,862
- That's Ida's grandson.
- <i>Come on, I'm in a hurry.</i>

844
01:26:30,028 --> 01:26:35,784
- Here, fella, go find your grandma.
- <i>Thanks for nothing.</i>

845
01:26:35,951 --> 01:26:41,540
When the police get here,
will you show them these pictures?

846
01:26:41,707 --> 01:26:44,960
<i>All right, I'm on the case now.</i>

847
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:51,175
<i>That is exactly what I need.</i>

848
01:26:51,341 --> 01:26:56,638
<i>I could find him in one of those.</i>
<i>Let's see if I remember this.</i>

849
01:26:56,805 --> 01:27:01,768
<i>I'll set this thing down right here</i>
<i>and get that door open.</i>

850
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:05,272
<i>What was it James said?</i>

851
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:09,651
<i>Stick this in here...</i>
<i>There it goes.</i>

852
01:27:09,818 --> 01:27:13,489
Move the circle around
and we're off.

853
01:27:13,697 --> 01:27:15,991
Mikey!

854
01:27:16,158 --> 01:27:18,911
Mikey!

855
01:27:22,706 --> 01:27:27,503
- He's in the back of that car.
- Let's get the cab.

856
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:31,381
- Hey!
- Stop!

857
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:43,352
<i>I got this driving thing knocked.</i>

858
01:27:48,774 --> 01:27:51,735
Move it!

859
01:27:53,111 --> 01:27:58,200
<i>There he is. Look at me.</i>
<i>Hey, James, I'm driving!</i>

860
01:27:59,535 --> 01:28:06,083
<i>James... where's he going?</i>

861
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,048
- What are you doing?
- I'll cut him off.

862
01:28:13,215 --> 01:28:15,634
You'll lose him.

863
01:28:17,803 --> 01:28:21,807
I know this alley
like the back of my hand.

864
01:28:37,197 --> 01:28:42,286
Mikey! He's gone!

865
01:28:42,452 --> 01:28:44,705
Mikey!

866
01:28:44,872 --> 01:28:50,294
- You had a little boy in there.
- What are you talking about?

867
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:53,255
He's about this big.

868
01:28:53,422 --> 01:28:58,218
- <i>This is a good place to spot him.</i>
- Mikey!

869
01:28:58,385 --> 01:29:01,680
Mikey, stop!

870
01:29:01,847 --> 01:29:05,225
- <i>James, is that you?</i>
- Mikey, don't move.

871
01:29:05,392 --> 01:29:08,896
<i>James, Mommy...</i>

872
01:29:09,062 --> 01:29:11,440
<i>Here I come.</i>

873
01:29:11,607 --> 01:29:15,110
- Mikey!
- <i>I'm coming.</i>

874
01:29:25,746 --> 01:29:31,418
- <i>Did you see what just happened?</i>
- Give me my baby.

875
01:29:34,505 --> 01:29:39,426
Are you all right, honey?
Let me see you.

876
01:29:39,593 --> 01:29:42,805
He doesn't have a scratch on him.

877
01:29:42,971 --> 01:29:45,849
<i>I finally got you both together.</i>

878
01:29:46,016 --> 01:29:49,853
I better take
him to the hospital anyway.

879
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:54,191
<i>Ma, I want James to be the daddy.</i>

880
01:29:54,358 --> 01:29:58,862
- Thanks for all your help.
- I'll take you home now.

881
01:30:00,447 --> 01:30:06,787
- Dada.
- I think he called you Dada.

882
01:30:06,954 --> 01:30:09,581
<i>No, I'm talking</i>
<i>to hear myself speak.</i>

883
01:30:09,748 --> 01:30:14,253
- He thinks you're his father.
- I've spent a lot of time with him.

884
01:30:14,419 --> 01:30:18,841
He probably thinks
we're going to end up together.

885
01:30:27,933 --> 01:30:31,728
<i>I hope</i>
<i>they don't get stuck together.</i>

886
01:30:36,024 --> 01:30:40,737
<i>Should I tell them</i>
<i>I need a new diaper?</i>

887
01:30:40,904 --> 01:30:42,948
<i>No, I'll wait.</i>

888
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,381
- Hi, honey.
- Mikey, this is your sister Julie.

889
01:31:41,548 --> 01:31:44,134
Say "Hi, Julie."

890
01:31:44,301 --> 01:31:49,681
<i>Don't start with me, kid! I've had</i>
<i>a day you wouldn't believe.</i>

891
01:35:43,499 --> 01:35:47,878
