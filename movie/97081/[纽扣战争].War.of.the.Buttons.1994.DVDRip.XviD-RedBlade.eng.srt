00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,391
(Woman) In Ireland,
I grew up in a tiny village by the sea.

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,392
It was here that my best friend, a boy,

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,228
was fighting with another boy,
who lived in the next village.

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,918
Sounds silly,

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,916
but they were always fighting.

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,393
Typical boys.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,399
Come on!

9
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,758
Wait, wait, wait for me.

10
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,797
Fellas, hang on!

11
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,277
- (All) Father!
- (Bike bell)

12
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,072
(All talk at once)

13
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,553
Only 1 0p, Father.

14
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,351
(Priest) Get out of it.

15
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,510
(Boy) Let`s try the wharf.

16
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,232
- Morning, Father.
- Marie.

17
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,799
Come on!

18
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,512
Wanna buy some tickets for the draw?

19
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,312
1 0p a page, pound for a book.

20
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,989
It`s for the hospital in Skibb. The master,
he says you never know the moment.

21
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,759
That`s true enough,
but you`re too late, son,

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,836
the Carrickdowse boys
have beaten you to it.

23
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,269
The Carrick boys,
what are you buying off them for,

24
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,038
when your own kids are stuck with them?

25
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,911
We`re loaded up with tickets, son,

26
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,315
you can ask so much of a man
and no more.

27
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,399
Isn`t that the god`s truth?
We`ve more tickets than fish. (Laughs)

28
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,316
Jonjo, they won`t have reached him yet.

29
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,078
- Jonjo!
- We`ll catch him at the bridge.

30
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,953
Thanks for nothing, you mean scabs!

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,399
Hoy!

32
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,715
Wait till I talk to your father.

33
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,792
- Jonjo!
- Jonjo!

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,558
Jonjo, wait up!

35
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,953
- Jonjo!
- Jonjo, wait up!

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,116
- Jonjo!
- Jonjo!

37
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,237
- Jonjo!
- (Beeps horn)

38
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,872
- Jonjo!
- (All talk at once)

39
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,036
Buy some tickets?

40
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,229
Hey, you lot!

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,229
- Beat it!
- Get back to Carrick.

42
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,838
You know what that line stands for.

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,872
Keep on your own side
and leave our postman alone.

44
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,718
Rubbish, he`s nobody`s postman.
He belongs to everyone.

45
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,432
He`s ours till he leaves Ballydowse.

46
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,072
Yeah, this half of the bridge is ours.

47
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,032
When he`s on your side, you have him,
till then, keep your hands off.

48
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,311
- Yeah, keep your stinkin` hands off.
- What did you say?

49
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,191
Keep your stinkin` hands off.

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,192
Whose stinkin` hands?

51
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,912
- Oi!
- Ahh! Leave me alone.

52
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,636
- l`ll tell Fergus, Fergus`ll kill you.
- Fergus isn`t here, is he, you little wanker.

53
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,671
(Shouting)

54
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,553
Help!

55
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,511
Help me!

56
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,959
Get Fergus!

57
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,550
Fergus! Fergus!

58
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
Fergus, the Carricks, on the bridge.

59
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,559
They`ve got Little Con.

60
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,391
You wanna go in, eh?
You wanna go for a swim?

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,590
No! Help me! Help!

62
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,438
Someone! No! Help!

63
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,879
Help!

64
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,433
And what was that about my hands?

65
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,436
Nothing, nothing!

66
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,994
- (All shouting)
- Here, cut that out.

67
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,031
- Help!
- Hey!

68
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,755
- (Whistles)
- Geronimo.

69
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,470
You lucky little maggot.

70
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,157
Now clear off, tosspot,
run off home to Mammy.

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,154
(All laugh and jeer)

72
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,678
(Marie) Too late.

73
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,994
(Fergus) Yeah.

74
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,869
Great!

75
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,188
(Little Con) Con?

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,593
(Big Con) What?

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,790
(Little Con) What does tosspot mean?

78
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,396
(Big Con) I don`t know. Come on.

79
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,908
Here... Right here.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,558
I know what a pot is.

81
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,478
We all know what a pot is,
and toss.

82
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,318
It`s not the words,
it`s what they mean together that counts.

83
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,196
Come in.

84
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,351
Please, sir, how many swearwords
do you know?

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,719
- What makes you think I know any?
- You`re grown-up.

86
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,193
Me daddy knows hundreds.

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,628
Well, then,
you best put your problem to him.

88
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,032
(Girl) Hey! Watch it.

89
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,792
Who cares what it means?
It`s how bad it is that matters.

90
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,071
If it`s really bad, we`ve got to
come up with something worse.

91
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,237
- Sir doesn`t even know what it means.
- You never said it to him, did you?

92
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,236
I never said it, not to his face.

93
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,316
- (Bike bell)
- (Priest) Out of the way, boys.

94
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,837
Good work, Little Con.

95
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,359
Gerard.

96
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,877
Do you like lollipops?

97
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,319
See the church?

98
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,758
Go tell the priest... (Whispers)

99
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,552
(Bell)

100
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,914
Now we`ll see
how bad the bloody word is.

101
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,714
(Quietly) Tosspot, tosspot,
tosspot, tosspot.

102
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,916
(Master) Pitiful. Pitiful effort.

103
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,110
(Whispers) Hey, Tim, any sign yet?

104
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,354
Not yet.

105
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,789
(Master) I hope the moment never arrives
for any of you.

106
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,319
Oi! Come back here!

107
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,236
- They`re off!
- (All) They`re off!

108
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,919
Hey! Get back to your seats!

109
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,999
- (Cheering)
- Get back to your seats now!

110
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,029
Oh!

111
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,993
(Priest) l`ll see your mother, you little lout.
On your way now!

112
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,996
On your way!

113
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,789
Seats, seats,
come on, come on, move it!

114
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,875
(All talking among themselves)

115
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,517
Got the paint?

116
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,518
- Lime green or electric blue?
- Forget the green, keep the blue.

117
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,757
- And l`ve got a torch.
- Great. What`s the time?

118
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,835
It`s 9:15.

119
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,235
Hey, fellas, wait for me.

120
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,271
(Panting)

121
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,956
I`ve been feeding the calves,
l`m puffed out.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,116
Keep it down.
Big Con is still to come.

123
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,679
Here he is now.

124
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,119
What`s he doing here?

125
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,833
This is a guerrilla operation,
it`s no place for kids.

126
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,155
Wasn`t it me
that was held over the water?

127
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,317
- He`s got a point.
- It was the only way we could get out.

128
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,271
We said we`d take the master his eggs.

129
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,154
- I thought your dad was on the boats.
- His mum keeps chickens.

130
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,077
- Is it herring they`re after?
- Hake.

131
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,953
- Shut up, the pair of you.
- l`m discussing his daddy`s catch.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,956
You wanna talk fishin`,
get yourselves out.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,594
We`ve a war on here,
concentrate.

134
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,269
OK. Only the bridge is in the open,
we clear it as quick as we can.

135
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,117
After that, we cut through the woods.

136
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,197
I`m not going through any woods!
These trousers are brand-new.

137
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,753
Then get off home to your mammy.

138
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,394
- Says who?
- I do. I`m leading this expedition.

139
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,749
Why you?
We haven`t had a vote yet.

140
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,395
- OK, all in favour of me, say aye.
- (All) Aye.

141
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,394
- (Dog barking)
- (Whispers) Take your shoes off.

142
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,431
(Dogs barking)

143
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,192
(Whispers) Come on.

144
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,234
(Door opens)

145
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,437
He`s coming.

146
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,119
Little Con, get out there, quick.

147
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,230
I can`t. I`m scared.

148
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,068
What`s there to be scared about?
You`re only a little kid with eggs. Go on!

149
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,276
So, it`s you, is it,
makin` all them dogs bark?

150
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,196
- Oh!
- (Eggs smash)

151
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,872
Are you all right? Hey?

152
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,998
Come over here
and we`ll have a look at you.

153
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,037
Come in, we`ll fix you up.

154
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,071
My brother...

155
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,395
They`ve got him.

156
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,670
He`s a prisoner of war.

157
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,473
- Thanks a bundle for bringing him.
- (Door slams)

158
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,078
- Who have you got there?
- I dunno.

159
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,680
- What`s his name?
- I don`t know, I can`t get a word out of him.

160
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,756
- Are you dumb, is it?
- Michael...

161
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,950
you`ve the bedside manner
of a bullock.

162
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,798
The poor little boy`s in shock.
Can`t you see that?

163
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,592
Yelling and bawling at him like that.

164
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,359
I wasn`t yelling and bawling at him.
I was enquiring.

165
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,073
God help us if you ever start,
the whole town`ll be tortured.

166
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,031
We have to find out
where he comes from,

167
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,877
walking around in the night with his eggs.

168
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,593
His father`ll be shouting
and roarin` round lookin` for him.

169
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,792
Give him time, the little boy`s had
a nasty shock, haven`t you, darlin`?

170
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,594
- l`ll get him something to buck him up.
- Michael, he`s only a child.

171
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,108
(Michael) I was taking whiskey
with me mother`s milk.

172
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,754
(Mother) Aye, and look at
the state of you now.

173
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,112
(Michael) Here you go.

174
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,189
He`s drinkin` whiskey in Geronimo`s house,
with himself and Gorilla at the table.

175
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,595
- Great!
- Great?

176
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,119
He`ll keep them busy.

177
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,151
Give us the paint.

178
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,115
Boffin, you come too,
l`ll need you for the spelling.

179
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,718
The rest of you, cover us.

180
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,553
Hold this, Boffin.

181
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,475
Are you sure, Fergus?
It`s a church. It`s a mortal sin.

182
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,478
Like I say, this is war.

183
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,954
(Laughs) A kid and a half this,
no mistake.

184
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,116
(Mother) How are you feeling, son?

185
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,073
I smashed me eggs.

186
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,951
It`s his eggs he`s fretting over.

187
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,673
Is that all it is?
Sure we`ve bushels of eggs.

188
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,951
Jerome, go out the back
and fill his box with eggs.

189
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,592
- What?
- Do as your mammy says.

190
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,431
- l`m not waiting on him.
- He`s busy, he`s doing his lessons, mister.

191
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,709
Busy? Well, you can give him a hand.

192
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,553
Eggs! Now, the pair of yous
and don`t argue.

193
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,913
- (Door bangs)
- Try makin` a bit more noise.

194
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,755
One for the road?

195
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,192
S.

196
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,272
S.

197
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,471

198
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,437
- (Hoots)
- (Whistles)

199
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,074
A car. Quick.

200
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,914
Finished.

201
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,791
Boffin, come on.

202
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,870
(Dogs barking)

203
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,876
Thanks. Good night.

204
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,558
(Michael) And mind them eggs now.

205
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,397
Yes.

206
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,510
(Loudly)  In the merry month of May

207
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,437
From me home I started

208
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,392
Left the girls of Tuam
Nearly broken-hearted

209
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,318
Salute me father dear
Kiss me darlin` mother

210
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,999
Drank a pint of beer
Me grief and tears to smother...

211
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,679
My brother, he`s drunk as a skunk.

212
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,676
(All laugh)

213
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,312
To banish ghosts and goblins

214
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,918
(All)  A brand-new pair of brogues

215
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,758
Rattled over the bogs
Frightened all the dogs

216
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,236
On the rocky road to Dublin
One, two, three, four, five

217
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,158
Hunt the hare
And turn her down the rocky road

218
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,510
And all the way to Dublin
Whacks fer al de da

219
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,348
In the merry month of May
From my home I started

220
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,472
Left the girls of Tuam
Nearly broken-hearted

221
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,273
Salute me father dear
Kiss me darlin` mother

222
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,278
Drank a pint of beer
My grief and tears to smother

223
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,551
Off to reap the corn
Leave where I was born...

224
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,637
(Church bell)

225
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,599
Hold it.

226
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,711
What`s happening?
Can you see any Carricks?

227
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,273
(Fergus) No, but they`ll be there.

228
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,151
Give us a look.

229
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,433
Hey, lads, I think I feel a bit woozy.

230
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,278
- Bad luck.
- (They laugh)

231
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,232
- Oh!
- Take cover!

232
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,470
That`s right, hide why don`t you?

233
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,830
Don`t show your ugly mugs,
the shock would sink our boat.

234
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,029
- What`s your problem, tosspot?
- We haven`t got a problem.

235
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,832
Have you finished scrubbing the paint

236
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,632
- from the old chapel board?
- (All laugh)

237
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,393

(All laugh)

239
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,918
Does yer mammy still wash her knickers
in the kitchen sink?

240
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,473
She doesn`t have a kitchen sink.

241
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,432
Come on up to Carrickdowse,
we`ll lend you a bath.

242
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,075
A bath? Does it have
your rubber ducky in it, Gorilla?

243
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,109
(Laughter)

244
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,391
Does your mammy still powder your bum,

245
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,237

246
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,919

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,595
(Makes clucking noises)

252
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,234
Tomorrow, after school,

253
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,272
You die. D`you hear?
The whole flamin` lot of you.

254

255
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,591

276
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,519
Where`s your mates?
I thought you came for a fight.

277
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,790
Maybe their mammies
wouldn`t let them out.

278
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,876
Who rattled your cage, Gorilla?

279
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,037
What`s up,
haven`t you had your bananas yet?

280
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,071
Well, chew on these
and shut your face.

281
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,192
Big boy now, eh?
You weren`t so full of lip on the bridge.

Watch it, it`s a trap.

285
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,397
- You`re full of crap, apehead.
- Get back up your tree, Gorilla.

286
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,510
- Monkey, monkey, monkey.

Come on, get outta here.

296
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,156
Come on, get back, get up the hill.

297
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,353
What do we do about Gorilla?

298
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,118
- l`ll kill you!
- Leave him.

299
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,072
That`ll teach him
to obey my flamin` orders.

300
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,832
Up against the tree, lads.

Don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me!

303
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,710
Stand back!
Give us your knife, Tich.

304
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,513
What are you gonna do?
Don`t hurt me, l`ll tell me dad.

305
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,629
(All laugh)

306
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,874
Well, now, me brave bullyboy,

308
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,358
- His ears.
- His tongue.

309
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,312
- His nose, cut off his nose.
- (All laugh)

310
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,318
I think wee Con
should have the right to choose.

311
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,237
His willy, cut off his willy.

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,759
(All laugh)

313
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,074
I`ll tell the priest.

314
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,270
Not without a tongue, you won`t.

315
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,197
What does it matter, bullyboy, eh,
ears, nose, tongue,

316
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,913
if a fella keeps his pride?

317
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,999
And you, my fine brave boy,
have nothing to be proud about at all.

318
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,631
(All cheer)

319
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,515
Now tell your daddy and the priest,
and tell your mate Geronimo,

320
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,155
tell them all what they`ll get if they mess
with the boys from Ballydowse.

321
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,077
(All cheer)

322
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,997
You haven`t seen the last of us.

323
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,758
(All laugh)

324
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,631
(Whispers)

325
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,598
Little Con, come here.

326
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,551
Hold out your hands.

327
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,989
Trophies from the Battle of Murphy`s Dunes.

328
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,871
(All cheer)

329
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,156
In the merry month of May
From my home I started

330
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,272
Left the girls of Tuam
nearly broken-hearted

331
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,073
Salute me father dear
Kissed me darlin` mother

332
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,271
Drank a pint of beer
Me grief and tears to smother...

333
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,672
Secondly, you need to be a citizen
of the country in question.

334
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,750
Thirdly, you must have reached
the ripe old age of 1 8, God help us,

335
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,952
and fourthly, your name
must be on the electoral roll.

336
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,995
Tonight they`ve challenged.
Jonjo brought a note.

337
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,234
Haven`t they had enough?

338
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,635
We`ll give them more.
Tell the others.

339
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,910
- Fergus?
- Sir?

340
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,350
We`re discussing democracy,
the civilised running of a civilised state.

341
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,392
Do you wish to take part or are
other considerations more pressing?

342
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,955
- Yes, sir. No, sir.
- l`m grateful.

343
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,037
Now, four points necessary
to qualify to vote - name them.

344
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,992
They concern citizenship, me bucko.
Freedom!

345
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,476
A condition you`re favourite to lose tonight
if you don`t at least take a plunge.

346
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,556
Not tonight, sir. Another night, eh?

347
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,990
Other nights don`t fit the bill. Have a go,
man. Where`s your fighting spirit?

348
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,872
Geography, sir,
you`ve got to know your geography.

349
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,433
Does one no harm, Pat,
to know your place in the world,

350
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,914
but that won`t get you a vote.

351
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,714
- You`ve got to belong to the country?
- Which country?

352
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,399
- lreland, sir, you`ve got to be lrish.
- Right on one.

353
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,078
Now, what else?

354
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,315
(Whispers) If he`s kept in, we`ve had it.

355
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,397
Number two, could you have a vote,
for instance?

356
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,874
(Whispers) Cos you`ve still
got no hairs on your bum.

357
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,309
- (All snigger)
- What`s that, Boffin?

358
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,918
Me, sir?

359
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,791
You`ve something to offer?

360
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,719
(Laughter)

361
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,392
Connor, stay in after school.

362
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,000
- No, sir!
- You too, Fergus, don`t argue.

363
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,316
- Sir, it was me.
- And you too. You live in a free country.

364
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,672
Men died to make it so and by God,
l`ll see you appreciate the fact.

365
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,590
- ldiots, we`re three light now.
- Do you think we should not go?

366
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,872
And let them think we`ve chickened out?
We`ve got to go. (Sighs)

367
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,036
(Church bell)

368
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,591
(Fergus) Come on, we`ll catch up with them.

369
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,319
Where are you going?

370
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,479
It`s your brother.

371
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,875
- Look at the state of him.
- Oh!

372
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,599
- What`s up with you?
- There was loads of them, all big fellas.

373
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,632
Where were you?
I knew I should never have come.

374
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,558
- Where are the others?
- I don`t know. I`m going home.

375
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,068
- (Wails)
- Tell Mam you fell over, OK?

376
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,553
And stop your yelling.

377
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,508
- What in hell happened to you?
- There were hundreds of `em.

378
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,074
- They were too strong.
- You`re joking, they`re Carricks!

379
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,317
- Yeah, they beat the stuffing out of us.
- Quit whingeing.

380
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,078
- What`s Tich done?
- Dead leg.

381
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,634
Leave him here, we`ll pick him up
on the way back. Come on.

382
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,749
Back?

383
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,153
Are you fit or not?

384
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,519
Yeah, but...

385
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,073
Riley?

386
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,314
I think...

387
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,191
Then come on.

388
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,599
- Give up, you pillock.
- Surrender.

389
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,953
Come and get me.

390
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,038
Gonna have to come down sometime.

391
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,390
Gonna have to pee sometime
and I know where l`ll be aiming.

392
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,589
Fergus!

393
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,598
Fergus!
Fergus is coming!

394
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,474
Brendan, Chick, keep him up there,
the rest of you take cover.

395
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,558
Look out, Fergus, they`re...
Oh!

396
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,715
Sorry.

397
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,954
(Both grunt)

398
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,911
Get him.

399
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,359
Give us a hand, will you?

400
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,118
(All) Fergus!

401
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,674
Don`t worry, l`ll be all right.
Scram!

402
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,039
I`ve got his neck.

403
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,076
- Bring him to that tree, lads.
- Yeah, you maggot!

404
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,592
Don`t hurt me, don`t torture me,
l`ll tell me daddy.

405
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,200
Cut me mickey off, would you?

406
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,356
Yeah!

407
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,709
- That`s enough.
- He did it to me.

408
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,192
OK, then,

409
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,629
Iet`s give this fella
a pig with the same snout.

410
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,399
(All) Yeah!

411
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,755
(All) Yeah!

412
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,436
(All) Yeah!

413
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,712
- (All) Yeah!
- Go on.

414
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,955
- Push off!
- Get back to Ballydowse.

415
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,195
Run off home to Mammy, tosspot!

416
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,198
And your daddy,
if you ever find out who he is.

417
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,997
Shut your mouth!

418
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,878
Lay off.

419
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,791
And where the hell
have you been, huh?

420
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,400
Out gallivantin`
while l`m doin` your chores.

421
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,114
Now, I warned you, boy,
l`ll have you sent...

422
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,993
Leave him eat.
You can talk about gallivantin`.

423
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,439
I`m workin`, sellin` horses,

424
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,153
to buy the crust
that he`s shovin` into his lazy gob.

425
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,475
It`s real hard work at those horse fairs.

426
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,272
Liftin` pints is fierce tirin`.

427
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,914
You do a deal and you drink on it,
that`s the way.

428
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,916
If it was up to you,
we`d be all eatin` hay, huh?

429
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,871
Where were you anyway,
you little bastard?

430
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,514
Now look what you`ve done,
you`ve ripped his bloody jacket!

431
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,073
It wasn`t stitched properly.

432
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,430
It was properly stitched
until you grabbed him, you big ape!

433
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,675
- Don`t you shout at me!
- Now look what you`ve done!

434
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,631
Shut up!

435
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,353
I`ve got no buttons or nothing nowhere.

436
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,710
No laces, no belt,
so quit yelling, the pair of you.

437
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,593
All my buttons are off
and my tie`s ripped to shreds.

438
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,874
And you`re not made of money,

439
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,956
so give me a good whipping
and get it over with.

440
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,752
Who did this to you?

441
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,711
You tell me or else.

442
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,797
If I told you, l`d only get the same,
so get it over with.

443
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,597
Go easy on him, that`ll do no good.

444
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,279
Tell him we`ll send him to school naked,
that`ll teach him.

445
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,431
(Fergus groans)

446
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,751
(Groaning continues)

447
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,398
(Laughs)

448
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,277
You`re a fool, Fergus, do you know that?
And mainly to yourself.

449
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,276
Yes, sir.

450
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,309
(Laughs)

451
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,231
- You`re asking for it, boyo.
- I can`t help myself, sir.

452
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,236
Something funny inside my head,
it won`t go.

453
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,953
- (Master) Have you now?
- Not a brain, that`s for sure.

454
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,319
You shut your face!

455
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,394
(Bell)

456
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,317
Maybe later we`ll all share the joke.

457
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,397
Right, playtime.
Out with the lot of you.

458
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,994
- You too, Fergus.
- Me, sir, aren`t I kept in?

459
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,917
Correct.

460
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,951
Wasn`t that serious enough, sir?

461
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,991
- What?
- Laughing, sir, to be kept in?

462
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,837
- Do you want to be kept in?
- No, sir.

463
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,279
Then keep your mouth shut.

464
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,272
What is it now?

465
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,788
- I have to know something, sir.
- What do you wanna know?

466
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,992
What`s serious and what`s not,
what`ll have me in trouble? It`s important.

467
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,838
It`s me daddy,
he says he`ll have me sent away.

468
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,598
Away?

469
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,799
- Where to?
- Just away.

470
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,195
He says he can get an order
or something.

471
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,516
Well, he can`t. Only a court.

472
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,869
If you`d stop foolin` about,
do something constructive...

473
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,832
- I can fish, catch rabbits and hares.
- Fergus...

474
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,996
you might be a big wee fella
in Murphy`s Dunes,

475
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,429
but round here, l`m the boss.

476
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,358
Here, I like to be respected, OK?

477
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,789
Just give me a bit of effort and l`ll speak up
for you if ever ``away`` is on the cards.

478
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,789
Yes, sir.

479
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,756
By the way, what was the joke back there?
I could do with a laugh.

480
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,631
I messed up my clothes a bit
last night, sir,

481
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,911
and my mammy said
she`d send me to school bare-arsed.

482
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,394
I find that prospect more horrifying
than amusing.

483
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,512
Yes, sir.
It`s just given me a funny idea.

484
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,159
Here. Run for it, run for it!

485
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,237
- What`s up with him?
- He`s done his thumb.

486
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,991
- The Carricks?
- Sort of.

487
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,112
- It was those buttons you gave him.
- Shut up, will you?

488
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,516
He hid them on top of the toilet, slipped,
and the whole lot came down on him.

489
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,155
Don`t worry, Little Con, wait till you see
what l`ve got for them next. (Laughs)

490
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,559
Jonjo!

491
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,991
Oh, no sign of peace talks yet?

492
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,600
Change of venue, somewhere
we can give them a real surprise.

493
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,269
What`s up? Too many dead bodies
piled up at Murphy`s Dunes?

494
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,756
- Any sign?
- No. Only Tim,

495
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,076
he`s trapped up there in the stones.
Fergus and the rest have chickened out.

496
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,599
Chickened out?

497
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,910
OK, surround the stones,
but keep a good lookout for the rest.

498
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,190
Here we are again, Tim, boy.

499
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,392
On your own, are you?

500
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,638
Coming down this time or do we drag you?

501
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,319
Ha! You couldn`t drag a baby
from its cradle.

502
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,352
Brendan, Chick, have every stitch off him.

503
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,198
- The rest of you...charge!
- (All) Charge!

504
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,919
(All shouting)

505
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,954
(Horn)

506
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,878
(All cheer)

507
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,790
Aargh!

508
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,118
(All shouting)

509
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,957
Charge!

510
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,631
Stand your ground, stand your ground!

511
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,269
Come back, come back, stand and fight.

512
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,114
Go on, lads, get `em! Go on, lads!

513
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,715
Hee-ah!

514
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,150
(Distant shouting)

515
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,199
Get out of me way!

516
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,509
(All shouting)

517
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,312
- We`ll get you back.
- (All) Yeah!

518
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,349
Now!

519
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,790
(Cheering)

520
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,517
(Cheering)

521
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,513
Yes!

522
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,437
- Ahh!
- Run!

523
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,757
(Groans of pain)

524
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,517
Oh! Oh!

525
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,232
- Oh!
- Shut up, will you?

526
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,111
I`m scratched and stung all over.

527
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,991
I knew I shouldn`t never have come.

528
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,759
Quit whingeing.
We licked `em, didn`t we?

529
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,358
Yeah, with girls.

530
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,833
And what`s wrong with girls?

531
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,155
Nothing.
Just like to have known, that`s all.

532
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,510
Prancing around stark naked`s bad enough,
having women laughing at you?

533
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,710
What`s up?
Ashamed of what you`ve got?

534
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,748
It`s a free country, l`m not fighting starkers
again, you can forget it.

535
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,553
Yeah, and l`m not losing no more buttons.

536
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,957
Some of us have got decent clothes,
even if you haven`t.

537
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,799
So you won`t fight, is that it?

538
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,717
It`s not our fault, Fergie.

539
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,796
Yeah, it`s our parents, they`ll kill us.

540
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,478
Kill us?

541
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,871
What`s a few buttons off to you lot, eh?
What`s your shirts destroyed to you?

542
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,148
Nothing.

543
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,988
I`m the one that`s getting sent away.
You can go to hell, the lot of you.

544
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,633
(Door bangs)

545
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,836
(Crying)

546
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,719
Fergus?

547
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,634
- Fergus, what`s wrong?
- Go away.

548
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,950
Go away, leave me alone.

549
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,759
(Master) Poblacht...

550
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,673
- (Master continues speaking Gaelic)
- (Whispers) Oi!

551
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,631
(Master speaks Gaelic)

552
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,398
Gimme that paper, Riley.

553
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,070
- Paper, sir?
- Yes, in the lrish...

554
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,076
(Speaks Gaelic)

555
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,793
Paper in your hand.
Did you not know it was there?

556
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,115
We learn something every day.
Sit down.

557
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,513
Fergus, did you write this?

558
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,039
Sir, I did.

559
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,718
Come up here.

560
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,391
Read it out.

561
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,000
- Sir?
- Read it aloud.

562
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,076
- To find the money...
- (Translates in Gaelic)

563
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,509
..to buy buttons, shoelaces,
ties and belts...

564
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,791
(Master translates in Gaelic)

565
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,872
-..everybody must...
- (ln Gaelic)

566
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,036
..pay a tax of one pound a week.

567
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,310
(Master translates in Gaelic)

568
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,468
Now...

569
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,790
Everybody, in best writing,
one hundred times in your native tongue.

570
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,831
(All sigh)

571
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,476
(All shouting)

572
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,474
Just bugger off, the lot of you.

573
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,999
What`s up with you?

574
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,798
One pound a week, that`s what.
Where am I gonna get a pound from?

575
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,990
Where are we all?
We`re all in the same boat.

576
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,031
- A republic, yeah.
- We`re all not equal.

577
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,753
Some has money and some don`t,
and I don`t.

578
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,313
I got none.

579
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,033
- Me neither.
- I get a bit on Saturdays.

580
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,672
OK.

581
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,950
Stand over there,
all those who have money.

582
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,070
Those who don`t,
join Little Con in the jacks.

583
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,392
Why should the poor
stand in the toilets?

584
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,351
Just because we`re broke, it`s not fair.

585
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,073
This isn`t equality,
it`s shaming those that have nothing.

586
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,432
All right, then, swap over.

587
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,959
Those who can pay, stand in there.

588
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,548
You`re jokin`. I`m not paying good money
to stand in the toilets. Forget it.

589
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,433
He`s right. We can`t all be equal
if some pay and some don`t.

590
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,789
- Exactly.
- We`re all equal if no one pays.

591
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,114
- (All) Yeah.
- No.

592
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,674
- Only when everybody pays the same.
- (All) Yeah.

593
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,711
Boffin, what`s equality?

594
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,719
Having identical privileges, rights and
status in the eyes of society and the law.

595
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,399
Like the Amish in America...

596
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,112
OK!

597
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,993
Forget what you`ve got in your pockets now,
that doesn`t count.

598
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,315
We don`t use it for the war,
it`s for our own things.

599
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,679
I have nothing anyway.

600
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,109
Me neither, but we`ve got to find ways
to make money.

601
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,799
Money for all of us to buy buttons
and things for the war.

602
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,114
Boffin, is that equality?

603
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,833
- Yeah, that`s equality.
- (All) Yeah.

604
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,998
And all the stuff, when we get it,
where we gonna keep it?

605
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,917
In our HQ.

606
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,639
- What`s an HQ?
- (Bell)

607
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,272
(All laugh)

608
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,793
Ready?

609
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,998
Watch your backs.

610
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,518
- Where will I put this?
- On the roof.

611
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,472
And make sure there`s no leaks.

612
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,193
- l`m off on my rounds now, good luck.
- Good luck.

613
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,038
How many buckets?

614
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,479
Two and a bit.

615
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,197
Two buckets, that`s two pounds,
and a bit, 20p.

616
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,991
That`s €2.20.

617
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,071
- Good luck.
- See you.

618
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,479
Where`s he going?

619
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,232
(Mooing)

620
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,510
- How many have you got?
- We can`t find none.

621
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,709
What do you mean?

622
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,990
There was loads when I passed here
this morning.

623
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,156
That was this morning.

624
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,236
What do you think they`re eating - celery?

625
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,555
You have to be up at the crack of dawn
to beat them lot.

626
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,195
Then get up.
Fergus`ll want some tomorrow, or else.

627
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,435
- Fox!
- A fox?

628
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,959
They`re worth a fortune.

629
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,197
A fox! A fox!

630
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,711
Fergus can go to hell.

631
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,070
Aren`t I up at the crack already,
milking our cows?

632
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,076
It`s Sunday tomorrow.

633
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,350
Tell that to the flippin` cows!

634
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,072
I can`t find them on my own.

635
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,837
Fergus, Fergus,
the boys are after a fox.

636
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,599
Get after it quick.
See where it goes to ground.

637
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,079
(All shouting)

638
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,637
Here, I got him here!

639
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,198
Right, we`ll smoke him out.
Boffin, get some dry grass.

640
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,117
Pat, Con, get a long stick.

641
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,559
- Little Con, bark.
- What?

642
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,398
Bark like a dog. You too, Tich,
down the hole.

643
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,509
(Both bark)

644
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,830
Boys, out the way.
Down, Boffin, quick.

645
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,997
- Yeah!
- Keep on poking back, keep on poking.

646
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,314
- Come on, Pat!
- Go on!

647
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,679
I can feel it moving.

648
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,154
- (All) Yeah!
- Go on, Pat!

649
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,797
Take it out!
It`s here.

650
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,432
- Ahh!
- (All cheer)

651
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,118
- (Thud)
- (All stop cheering)

652
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,189
It`s OK, it`s dead.

653
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,877
It`s a male.

654
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,433
Dammit.

655
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,993
Only half the price.

656
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,639
Pigs.

657
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,198
You pigs.

658
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,630
He was beautiful
and you killed him for money.

659
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,991
They`re killers, they all are.

660
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,837
They kill for the fun of it.

661
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,997
Yeah, like you did, all of you.

662
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,911
Fishy!

663
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,799
What happened?

664
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,076
Geronimo, he said
I looked too pleased with myself.

665
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,758
Who was supposed to be with him?

666
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,957
Where were you, Riley?

667
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,390
There wasn`t any mushrooms.
The cattle had eaten them all.

668
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,991
You did good, Fishy. Thanks.

669
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,999
- (Backfire)
- (She gasps)

670
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,438
Sorry, Marie.

671
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,630
The devil himselfs in me motor.

672
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,797
I`d be better off driving
the entire contraption into the sea.

673
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,752
It`s OK, Mr Riley. No harm done.

674
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,949
If we have a table here
we can all get round,

675
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,996
- for war councils and that.
- (All) Yeah.

676
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,553
Where will we get a table?

677
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,068
We`ll make it -
planks, a few bricks, easy.

678
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,032
Yeah, and an old tablecloth on it,
it`ll look great.

679
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,115
What`ll we sit on?

680
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,754
- Our bums. What do you think?
- (Laughter)

681
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,395
What we need is bits and pieces,
to make the place feel like a real HQ.

682
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,158
We`ve an old clock in the shed.

683
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,679
Doesn`t go, but it`ll look good.

684
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,837
We got a picture of Mummy and Daddy
when they got married.

685
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,677
- No, we don`t!
- Yes, we do, above...

686
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,393
We don`t want that.
This is our place, no adults.

687
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,432
- (All) Yeah.
- Right, a place for the treasure.

688
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,229
Didn`t I tell you our Marie was great?

689
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,349
(All cheer)

690
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,951
Right, nobody touch anything
till Boffin`s made a list.

691
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,069
- An inventory.
- That.

692
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,680
- (Laughter)
- Let`s have a look first.

693
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,278
No!

694
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,470
Riley, you don`t touch, you don`t see.

695
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,512
You did nothing for it,
so you get nothing from it.

696
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,156
How much did he cost us?

697
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,758
€2.50 easy.

698
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,994
- Right, lads, take him outside.
- What?

699
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,395
Come back when you`ve earned your bit.

700
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,908
This isn`t a democracy.
This isn`t a republic.

701
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,269
- Get lost!
- Go home, Riley.

702
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,228
Clear off.

703
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,271
The whole lot of you can go to hell.

704
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,392
- Long live the King.
- lt`s a queen nowadays, you moron.

705
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,432
Then God save the Queen.
Balls to Ballydowse.

706
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,755
(All shout and jeer)

707
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,709
- What`s he done?
- Nothing, that`s just the point.

708
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,479
Yeah, except he let Fishy get bashed
by the Carricks.

709
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,478
Aye, but don`t worry, Fishy,
we`ll get `em back, won`t we?

710
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,919
(All) Yeah!

711
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,117
(Shouting)

712
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,479
Take aim.

713
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,919
(All shouting)

714
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,037
Fire!

715
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,479
Take aim.

716
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,919
Fire.

717
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,995
Aargh!

718
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,395
Fall back! Fall back.

719
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,074
Take aim.

720
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,149
Fire.

721
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,599
(Screaming)

722
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,394
Hold it, wait.

723
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,192
They`re surrendering.

724
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,196
Don`t you believe it.

725
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,472
What`s your game?

726
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,715
Truce.
We`ve a casualty here.

727
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,671
It`s a trap.
It must be.

728
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,392
Shut up.

729
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,233
OK, bring him out.

730
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,794
- A truce?
- A truce.

731
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,036
See what your flamin` catapults did.

732
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,911
One of you monkeys fired a stone.

733
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,520
- lt`s maybe broken its leg.
- You broke it, you mean.

734
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,028
- We don`t fire at rabbits.
- Only at you mockheads.

735
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,958
- We`ll make him a splint.
- Do you know how?

736
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,833
I did it on a pup once.
He`s young, he`s got a good chance.

737
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,518
Be great if you could.

738
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,790
- Cut me a twig.
- Billy.

739
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,190
- Wanna use my laces?
- No, yours are leather, mine`s string.

740
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,517
Riley? What are you doing here?

741
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,391
I thought Fergus kicked you out.

742
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,718
No, it`s OK, he let me back in.

743
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,914
I was in the fight, but I hurt my leg.
He sent me back to get it looked at.

744
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,997
- Looked at?
- Yeah, l`m injured.

745
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,397
OK. Sit down,
l`ll have a look at it for you.

746
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,911
Now, where does it hurt?

747
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,110
Me ankle.

748
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,473
It`s great being here on our own,
isn`t it, Marie?

749
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,231
- Go on, get out, Riley.
- Why, what`s wrong?

750
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,510
You`re not injured, you`re just a big kid.

751
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,073
Big kid?

752
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,590
And what`s Fergus and the rest, eh?
Playing house like a pack of girls.

753
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,278
Get out of my sight, you`re pathetic.

754
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,756
- You`ll look pathetic when I tell the master.
- You wouldn`t dare.

755
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,313
We`ll see.

756
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,759
Get out!

757
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,279
OK, what now?

758
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,436
What`s the time?

759
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,436
It`s ten past eight.

760
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,994
It`s a bit late.
We ought to be getting back.

761
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,632
Right, lads, back off,

762
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,353
but keep your guard up,
we don`t trust this lot an inch.

763
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,597
What was that? Was it us
waving the white flag, surrendering?

764
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,108
It was a truce, muttonhead.
Watch `em.

765
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,438
A truce? You`re all talk. What`s up,
scared of another hammering?

766
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,357
Funny, I can`t remember the first one.

767
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,389
(All laugh)

768
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,317
Yeah, and how about your da?

769
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,399
Maybe you`re scared he`ll give you one
when I send you home in shreds.

770
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,709
What was that?
Right, we`ll sort this out once and for all.

771
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,399
Saturday,
and this time to the bloody death.

772
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,237
- (Both spit)
- (All) Yeah!

773
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,917
The great battle of Kinsale had been
a disaster for the huge Spanish army,

774
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:48,033
who`d come to help the lrish in their fight
against their common enemy.

775
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,149
Elizabeth.

776
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,071
(Laughter)

777
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,717
The O`Driscolls,
the great clan of these parts,

778
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,955
had lent their castles to these Spanish,

779
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,639
in exchange
for fresh cannon and ammunition.

780
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,716
Buttons.

781
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,434
- Buttons.
- Did you say something, Riley?

782
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,635
I said buttons, sir.
That`s all.

783
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,994
With regard to what?

784
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,228
Nothing, sir.

785
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,714
Then button it,
or l`ll button it for you, OK?

786
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,557
Sir.

787
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,034
And now, to their horror,

788
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,039
the O`Driscolls realised
that their defeated allies

789
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,719
were bent on handing the castles over
to the enemy,

790
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,671
as part of their grubby terms of surrender.

791
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,593
- The O`Driscolls would have none of this...
- (Kids) Yeah!

792
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,279
..and led by the chief of the clan,

793
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,392
they set about retrieving their homes
and their honour.

794
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,989
So Bunduff, their main castle
was besieged,

795
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,918
- and the Spaniards thrown out.
- (Cheering)

796
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,397
But...the victorious O`Driscolls joy
was short-lived,

797
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,271
and l`ll tell you about that next week.

798
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,311
(All) Oh, sir!

799
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,952
(Master) Have a good weekend.

800
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,638
Maybe they won`t come.

801
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,432
They`ll come.

802
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,474
They`re here, the Ballys are here.

803
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,795
- Where are they?
- (All murmuring)

804
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,956
Quiet!

805
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,591
(Buttons jingling, rattling)

806
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,757
(All cheer)

807
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,956
Would you look at that.

808
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,592
He`s got himself a horse.

809
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,517
You can give up now
and we`ll let you home,

810
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,950
if you shout Ballydowse is the best
and will be to the end of the world.

811
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,116
(All cheer)

812
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,593
You`re all blather.

813
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,596
Come up here and get us if you dare,

814
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,677
- and we`ll show you who`s best.
- (All) Yeah!

815
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,076
All right, then, to the death!

816
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:49,072
Prepare for attack. Just keep them
down there, we`re relying on you.

817
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,119
For England and St George?

818
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,151
(Tuts) Shut up, will you.

819
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,872
Are you ready, me buckos?

820
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,797
(All cheer)

821
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,270
For Ballydowse and lreland.

822
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,197
- Charge!
- (Whinnies)

823
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,913
(Shouting)

824
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,393
Fire!

825
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,438
Fire!

826
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,718
(All shouting)

827
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,676
Charge!

828
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,995
Come on, get `em!

829
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,519
Charge!

830
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,078
(Shouting)

831
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,108
Fire at will!

832
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,556
Empty the buckets.

833
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,312
Hold them off the stairs.

834
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,759
(Horse whinnying)

835
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,995
(Shouting, screaming)

836
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,279
(Cries of pain)

837
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,470
Get into `em! Get into `em!

838
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,992
Come on, boys, get `em!

839
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,439
Aargh!

840
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,918
Aargh!

841
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,071
Get back out there!

842
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,752
You`ll never get me, Fergie!

843
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,949
Gorilla!

844
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,958
Get him, Tich.

845
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,750
(Whinnying)

846
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,398
Aargh!

847
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,112
(Battle cry

848
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,958
Come on, Boffin boy.

849
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,279
Aargh!

850
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,753
Fergus, help me!

851
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,916
Go on, go on, go on!

852
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,274
Go on, lads, get into `em! Come on!

853
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,719
Aargh!

854
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,798
Get out of it!

855
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,955
Geronimo!

856
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,595
Give us your knife, Pat.

857
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,437
They`ve got Geronimo! Geronimo!

858
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,755
- Bally forever!
- Get out of it!

859
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,472
(Jeering and shouting)

860
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,631
(Jeering)

861
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,271
(Cheering)

862
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,119
(Cheering)

863
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,991
(All cheer)

864
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,189
(Cheering)

865
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,595
Yeah!

866
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,631
(Jeering)

867
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,592
(Bus driver) Carrickdowse.

868
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,309
Wait a minute.

869
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,191
- Bye.
- Thank you very much.

870
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,993
- How are you, Mick, how`s it going?
- Cyril!

871
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,396
Shift yourself.
Shift yourself.

872
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,519
- Are you well?
- Not bad, not bad.

873
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,551
Where are you off to?

874
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,158
I`m off to town.

875
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,599
Hi, Geronimo.

876
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,238
It`s Jerome to you.

877
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,835
I`m in to pick up the hoover,
blew up last week. Yourself?

878
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,440
I`m going in to pay for the new tractor.

879
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,109
Mortgaged up to the hairs on me head,
God help me,

880
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,752
but she`s worth it, every penny.

881
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,597
Bang up to date.

882
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,872
(Cheering)

883
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,718
Quiet, everyone.
Boffin will make the opening speech.

884
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,591
(Cheering)

885
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,629
Now our battle`s won and oh, what fun
to see the Carricks on the run,

886
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,309
on Murphy`s Dunes, Gleniff as well,
and Bunduff too, it`s true to tell,

887
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,999
we sent them packing, back to hell.

888
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,359
(Cheering)

889
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,234
So, here`s to Fergus and Marie,
Fat Pat, Fishy, Tim and me,

890
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,671
Tich and Peter, Cons big and small,
and all who answer to Bally`s call.

891
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,110
So get around and we`ll rejoice
and sing of victory in one loud voice,

892
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,912
and of time`s to come, we`ll recall,

893
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,110
with the help of these trophies
on the wall,

894
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,390
the boys of Bally, hear us all.

895
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,759
(All cheer)

896
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,870
Right, a toast!

897
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,717
To the siege of Bunduff Castle.

898
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,113
(All cheer)

899
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,799
Where we made the Carricks
paddle in their own shite.

900
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,196
- Hey, language! We`re not like them.
- (All cheer)

901
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,639
One, two, three.

902
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,159
Come on, Marie.

903
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,710
Go on, Marie.

904
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,159
(Cheering)

905
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,270
Go on, Marie, go!

906
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,029
Where are you going?

907
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:34,993
I`ll be ten minutes, Dad.
I`m checking the oil.

908
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,798
Kids nowadays, huh?

909
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,717
Technological geniuses.

910
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,593
He`s a great mechanic,
brilliant with his hands.

911
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,919
Isn`t that a Carrick boy
that just jumped on?

912
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,673
Eh?

913
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,991
(Penny whistles playing, cheering)

914
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,559
Yee-ha!

915
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,513
Go on. Go on, show us how to dance!

916
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,312
(Vehicle approaches)

917
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,319
Quiet!

918
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,673
- lt`s only a tractor.
- lt`s somebody ploughing.

919
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,632
- On a Sunday?
- In the woods?

920
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,360
- It is a tractor.
- Whose is it?

921
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,197
Can`t see. It`s blue.

922
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,878
Who`s got a blue tractor?

923
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,353
Flamin` heck - Riley!

924
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,914
- What?
- His dad bought a new one yesterday.

925
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,599
Showed it to me daddy,
proud as punch.

926
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,835
What colour was it?

927
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,872
Blue, and Riley`s riding on the back of it.

928
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,354
(Yelling)

929
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,799
(Yells)

930
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,509
Beats your horse, eh, Fergus?

931
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,073
Beats your flamin` horse!

932
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,514
(All yell in alarm)

933
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,354
Aargh!

934
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,553
(Screams)

935
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,352
(Coughs)

936
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,789
(Metallic thud)

937
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,751
He made me do it.
He made me give him the keys.

938
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,274
My dad`s new tractor!

939
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,709
The tractor!
What am I gonna do?

940
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,954
(Roars)

941
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,752
I`ll kill you, l`ll kill you!

942
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,639
Get up!

943
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,994
Look at it.

944
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,197
You`ve destroyed our house!

945
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,515
We worked for it, built it ourselves,

946
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,152
and you made us run.

947
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,839
Helped a Carrick and made us run.

948
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,996
They`ll laugh at us
until the end of the world.

949
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,359
Stick a needle in his eyes.

950
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,753
Make him eat horse crap.

951
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,756
Burn him!
Burn the traitor`s feet.

952
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,155
(All) Yeah!

953
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,918
Take off your clothes.

954
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,188
Please...

955
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,038
Take `em off!
All of them!

956
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,913
You betrayed us,

957
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,359
betrayed us all.

958
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,119
Please!
Please don`t torture me.

959
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,310
We won`t touch you.

960
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,476
Burn them.

961
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,432
Now get off home.

962
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,914
We`ll let your daddy do the hurting.

963
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,912
(Mooing)

964
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,395
Come out, come out, the lot of you!

965
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,391
Come out!

966
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,478
Come out,

967
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,192
the lot of yous!

968
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,071
Don`t be shy.

969
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,998
Come out and see
what your brave boys have done.

970
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,439
All of `em.

971
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,040
Hooligans!
Animals!

972
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,832
Drunk!

973
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,190
They stripped him,
and tortured him,

974
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,993
and wrecked my new tractor!

975
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,508
I`m telling yous all now,
l`m warning yous,

976
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,997
expect a letter,
legal proceedings are underway,

977
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,315
and I intend to sue
every last one of you,

978
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,396
for every penny you`ve got.

979
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,034
Didn`t I tell you it was that boy, Fergus?
He`s the bloody ringleader.

980
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,913
And it`s always the poor parents
who have to suffer.

981
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,710
Keep your heads up, lads.
Remember, we won the war, didn`t we?

982
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,193
(All) Yeah.

983
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,196
What do you think they`ll do to us?

984
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,800
- Who cares?
- Maybe he hasn`t told them.

985
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,274
He`d have to,
he didn`t have any clothes on.

986
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,878
(All laugh)

987
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,552
What do we do now?

988
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,239
Little Con, you go first with Tich.

989
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,511
- You`re only kids, they won`t blame you.
- l`m not going.

990
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,599
We`ll all go together,
get it over with. OK, Fergus?

991
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,596
No, they`ll send me away.

992
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,677
After what he`ll have said we`ve done,
I won`t stand a chance.

993
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,676
We didn`t do anything.

994
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,631
Do you think they`ll believe that?

995
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,796
(Tim) He`s right. Come on, Marie.

996
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,396
- But where will you go?
- Somewhere where they won`t find me.

997
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,955
- Good luck.
- l`ll be OK.

998
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,711
(All) Bye, Fergus.

999
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,796
Little Con... you lead us in.

1000
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,478
Me?

1001
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,310
(Shouts of pain)

1002
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,038
Had a good hiding, has he?

1003
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,435
- What does it look like?
- I should bloody hope so!

1004
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,232
Deserves to be put away, if you ask me.

1005
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,633
Who`s asking you?

1006
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,116
What about your kids, huh? Running around
like animals, tearing up good clothes?

1007
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,958
Typical Ballydowse,
always a bunch of maniacs.

1008
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,788
Maniacs! Maniacs, is it, huh?

1009
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,719
Whose little bastard did I see climbing
into me tractor and leading my kid astray?

1010
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,115
Don`t call my kid a bastard.

1011
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,596
OK, then, a shite.
How does that suit you? Shite!

1012
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:16,108
I`ll tear your tongue out, you runt!
The whole lot o` yous!

1013
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,119
Don`t make me laugh. I could lick you
when I was a kid and I can lick you now.

1014
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,674
For God sake, fellas, calm down.

1015
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,793
It`s this kid Fergus`s fault.
Didn`t he start the whole bloody thing?

1016
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,559
Right.
Let`s go and find him, then,

1017
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,591
before he has
the whole place destroyed.

1018
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:43,277
It`s your kid we`re talking about.
He`s out there running wild.

1019
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,517
So is this horse.
He`s drowned in sweat.

1020
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,235
I`ll be lucky to fight the chill away from it,
and it cost me a bloody fortune.

1021
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,396
To hell with the horse.

1022
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,314
What about your son?

1023
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,999
It`s late, he`s on his own,
what are you gonna do about it?

1024
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,600
That`s where you`ve got it wrong,
teacher.

1025
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,198
He`s no son of mine.

1026
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,953
Ask her whose he is.

1027
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,595
It doesn`t matter whose brat he is,
he`s gotta be found and stopped,

1028
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,995
before he kills someone stone-dead.

1029
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,871
Don`t be so melodramatic, he`s a kid.

1030
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:23,311
If you do get him, you hammer him
and shove him off somewhere,

1031
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,636
where he`ll do no more harm
to neither man nor beast.

1032
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,992
Sergeant...
have you seen my young fella?

1033
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,956
Fergus, come out!

1034
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,672
Come out now!

1035
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,869
Fergus!
Come out now.

1036
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,479
Fergus?

1037
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,398
Fergus?

1038
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,392
All mended now, pal.

1039
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,550
What are you doing?

1040
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,433
I saw the smoke.
I`m on the run too.

1041
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,234
- They think I stole the tractor.
- I thought Riley gave you the keys.

1042
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,158
- He told them I made him do it.
- And they believed him.

1043
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,079
Typical.

1044
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,593
Do you want some?

1045
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,630
Sorry about the house.

1046
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,591
Forget it.

1047
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,998
It was a great idea, the tractor,
better than a horse.

1048
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,111
Recognise him?

1049
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,196
He healed a treat.

1050
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,196
(Geronimo) That`s good.

1051
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,639
Why did we do it?

1052
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,830
- What?
- Why did we fight?

1053
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,796
For the hell of it. What else is there?

1054
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,311
Let`s go back and face them.

1055
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,590
We can take them on together.

1056
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,154
I can`t.
They`ll send me away for certain.

1057
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,196
I`ll stick up for you.

1058
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,708
What I did was worse than you.

1059
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:42,070
They haven`t got a clue.
I`ll tell `em.

1060
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,078
(Bugle)

1061
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,599
That`s your Tim.

1062
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,991
(Bugle)

1063
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,430
It`s the police,
they must`ve followed you here.

1064
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,314
They`ve come to take me away.
Thanks a bundle.

1065
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,394
Fergus! No, Fergus!

1066
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,509
Fergus, come back. Fergus!

1067
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:32,988
(Man over megaphone) Stay where you are.
Stay exactly where you are.

1068
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,910
(Panting)

1069
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,596
There they are!

1070
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,392
(Master) Mother of God!

1071
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,398
(Gasps)

1072
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,111
(Tim) Geronimo!

1073
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,715
Stay where you are.
Stay exactly where you are.

1074
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,194
Don`t endanger yourself.

1075
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,912
Stay put.

1076
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,720
Get that chopper outta here,
it`ll blow them off.

1077
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,558
Michael, Michael,
get away from there.

1078
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,429
(Gasps)

1079
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,399
Fergus!

1080
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,750
Fergus!
Help me!

1081
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,438
Hold on!

1082
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,474
- Let go.
- I can`t.

1083
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,112
Let go, l`ve got you.

1084
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,114
(Grunts)

1085
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,196
It`s all right, you`re safe now.
I`ve got you, OK?

1086
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,832
Yeah.

1087
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,833
(Both) Aargh!

1088
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,599
(Cheering)

1089
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,788
(Whistling)

1090
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,797
(Whistling)

1091
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,311
It`s not too bad.

1092
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,391
There`s even a space for your pictures.

1093
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,998
Look, it won`t be too long till
I sort out this mess and get you outta here.

1094
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,309
Just don`t do anything stupid.
I`m counting on you.

1095
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,993
- Yes, sir.
- Don`t just say it, do it.

1096
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,918
By the way...

1097
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,792
Marie asked me to give you this.

1098
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,599
Right, l`m off.

1099
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,799
In you go. Take the bed next to him
and find yourself an empty locker.

1100
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,159
All right, Fergus?

1101
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,549
- What are you here for?
- Same as you, nothing.

1102
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,750
Hey!

1103
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,991
You think you`re a couple of hard men?

1104
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,993
Well, if needs be, l`m a hard man.

1105
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,598
Understand?

1106
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,032
What have you got there?

1107
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,359
None of your business.

1108
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,516
So, they didn`t believe you, eh?

1109
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,312
Believe what?

1110
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,396
That Riley took the tractor.

1111
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,908
Oh, I dunno, I never told `em.

1112
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,155
- You never told `em. Why not?
- What?

1113
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,954
And let that little rat get all the credit?
You must be joking.

1114
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,795
Geronimo, you know what you are,
don`t you?

1115
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,115
No, what`s that?

1116
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,799
A tosspot, a real tosspot.

1117
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,035
(Laughs)

1118
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:30,798
Right!

1119
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,595
(Both laugh)

1120
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,312
(Laughter)

1121
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,438
(Laughs)

1122
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,517
(Screams)

1123
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,199
(Both laugh)

1124
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,390
(Woman) And so ended
the war of the buttons.

1125
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,158
And what of these brave boys?

1126
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,277
Well, one became my husband,

1127
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:02,073
and the other is our oldest friend,

1128
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,395
but I`m not gonna tell you
which is which.

1129
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,110
