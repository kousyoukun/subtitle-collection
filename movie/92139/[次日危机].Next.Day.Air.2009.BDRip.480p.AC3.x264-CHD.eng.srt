1
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:56,080
I don't know what the fuck is going on here.

2
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:00,553
Shut the fuck up!

3
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:02,565
Fuck you. Fuck you, that's my shit!

4
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:03,965
It's in my house.

5
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:09,870
No, I don't got nothing to do with this shit. Yo! Why don't we just put the guns down?

6
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:15,473
Man, I just deliver packages for a living. What the fuck am I doing here?

7
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:17,507
What a day.

8
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:18,713
Shut the fuck up!

9
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:24,620
# Brain, Brain, go away #

10
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:26,596
# Come to play another day #

11
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:32,335
# Go away, go away #

12
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,240
7500 Wissahickon Avenue. Apartment 303, Philadelphia.

13
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:06,717
- Spell it.  - You serious?

14
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:10,450
Phila-del-phia, 19144.

15
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:13,188
Apartment 303. You sure about that?

16
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,731
Hell, yeah, I'm sure. I know where I live.

17
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:23,365
- Be sure you're there to sign for it.  - Don't worry. We'll be here.

18
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:30,508
Rhino.

19
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:32,918
Take that.

20
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:35,984
We gotta a couple of hours to set that off.

21
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,428
You sure you can trust that lady with this much work?

22
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:43,299
Right now, I got no choice. After that loss I took from Carlos...

23
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:47,466
Speaking of Carlos, I found him. He's in the car.

24
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,037
Let me out! Fuck, man!

25
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:56,578
- Look what the fuck he did to my face, man.  - What the fuck?

26
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:58,588
- You think I give a fuck about your face?  - I don't have it.

27
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:00,181
Let me tell you what happened.

28
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,989
I wasn't feeling it. I got the money from Jes¨²s.

29
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:07,125
I was ready to roll and I go to the airport, and just when I'm about to get on the plane

30
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,102
the Feds snatched me up and took it.

31
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,097
Look, I swear to God!

32
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:13,768
I just didn't know how to tell you. 'Cause you're fucking crazy.

33
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:17,178
I'm supposed to believe the Feds found $700,000 in your fucking suitcase?

34
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:18,807
- I'm not lying!  - That's what you want me to believe?

35
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:21,682
I'm not lying, all right? Fuck.

36
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:24,122
- Fuck, I'm not lying.  - Do him a favor.

37
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,181
No, Bodega. No!

38
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:41,274
And in other news, following up on the story we left you yesterday,

39
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:44,146
three masked gunmen apparently robbed the Prestige Bank

40
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,553
on the corner of Broad and Olney. Early details were sketchy.

41
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:50,718
However, police now believe that the would-be robbers

42
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:54,526
who intended to set it off, really never set it off at all.

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,091
Authorities say that all of the bank's funds are intact

44
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,106
and the only thing stolen were the bank's surveillance tapes.

45
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,074
- Shit.  - Sandy Carter reporting live

46
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:04,111
from Center City...

47
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:06,670
Surveillance tapes? Idiots!

48
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:11,214
Surveillance tapes? For real?

49
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:13,684
Surveillance tapes, fuck!

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,584
- It ain't my fault.  - What?

51
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:17,151
You're trying to say it's my fault? It ain't my fault.

52
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,788
You had us go up in that bank in the first place.

53
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:21,095
What? Bro, all I said was...

54
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,037
You keep the car running. We might as well all just go in there.

55
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:25,664
You know what I'm saying? It's the three of us.

56
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:28,576
We're in and we're out. All right?

57
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:32,516
What's up, man? You all looking at me like that.

58
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:33,642
- You ready for the money?  - Let's do it!

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,779
- Okay then, let's go!  - I need a gun, Dawg! I need a gun.

60
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:38,653
- Man, my fault, my fault, my fault.  - Man.

61
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:42,364
Yeah, you know what time it is. Get on the floor, now!

62
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,800
Dawg, don't make it a homicide. Do what the fuck you're told.

63
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,701
What you talking? It was perfect.

64
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:49,762
Turn around.

65
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,571
Hassie had the guard. I had the floor locked down.

66
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:54,168
Everybody be quiet, don't say shit!

67
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:55,646
Give me these glasses so I can see that paper.

68
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:57,343
All you had to do was...

69
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:58,442
Hit the safe.

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,954
- Stop right there, Guch.  - What?

71
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,683
I could have sworn I heard you say...

72
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:04,989
Yo. Get the tapes.

73
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:09,458
Why would I toss you a trash bag and ask you to get the tapes? Why?

74
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:13,233
You rise up in there like Billy the Kid, with the AK out.

75
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:14,864
At least I'm thinking you're gonna hit the drawers.

76
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,772
There better not be no pork in this either.

77
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:20,377
Come on, come on, give me them tapes.

78
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:21,814
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

79
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,910
You're trying to tell me the whole time you was in the vault

80
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:25,148
you ain't see no money?

81
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:28,090
- Brody, come on, man!  - I've got it, Guch. I'm coming.

82
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,130
My adrenaline was running. I don't remember.

83
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,029
I probably didn't see no money.

84
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:37,731
Guys, I got it. I got it. Let's go!

85
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:40,675
Yeah, even with the boy's glasses on, you didn't see no money, right?

86
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:43,212
That's 'cause you play too much.

87
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:48,945
- Let's get out.  - Come on. Open the door!

88
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,149
Open the door!

89
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,285
What the fuck, man?

90
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,591
Fuck. My bad, yo, my bad.

91
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:01,665
Come on, let's go! Yo, Brody!

92
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,208
I should've gave it to that fat bastard. Man, if my shit was working right...

93
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,575
What's wrong with your shit, Guch?

94
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:10,171
I don't know, man. I think the pin's fucked up or something.

95
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,743
It's like for some reason, you can pull the trigger one time...

96
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,686
Come on, man. Stop pointing that gun at me.

97
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:18,727
Come on, man. I ain't gonna shoot you with the motherfucking gun.

98
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,784
I know what I'm doing.

99
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,265
I'm saying, you pull this trigger one time, man, it'll shoot out every bullet in this clip.

100
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,463
Yeah, you could cut that fat bastard down, for real.

101
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,268
Yeah, I'll cut that fat bastard down,

102
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:30,173
and 10 more motherfuckers standing behind him, man.

103
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,848
Shit. We're in this bitch now, we ain't got no damn ride.

104
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:43,450
- That shit was stolen anyway.  - So what?

105
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,660
You're the only dude I know ride around in a stolen car for two years

106
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:48,723
and act like it's yours.

107
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:50,394
Well, I ain't got time to be stealing cars every day.

108
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:52,132
Don't blame me. Blame your boy right there.

109
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:53,936
He the one who locked the doors.

110
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,534
Who? That's your boy.

111
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,306
That's your boy. He told me you let him move in here.

112
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,871
He said you told him he could move in.

113
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,644
What? Ask him.

114
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:02,583
You ask him. You're bitching up about him. Acting like...

115
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,089
I don't have a problem with it. I'll ask him right now.

116
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,954
It ain't nothing to me, man.

117
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,426
Hassie! Wake up. Yo! Wake up.

118
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:16,569
What?

119
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:20,542
Like, who said you could live here?

120
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,077
You all did.

121
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:30,215
Damn!

122
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:32,455
Stupid motherfuckers waking me up. Shit.

123
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:33,825
That's your boy.

124
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:38,468
You heard what he just said. He said you all. He didn't say me.

125
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:40,129
I don't even know this dude.

126
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,330
He's crazy.

127
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:46,973
Oh, my God!

128
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,142
Leo, I saw that.

129
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:53,153
No, you didn't.

130
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,683
Here. Try not to drop this one. Thank you.

131
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:03,266
I'm glad you're in a good mood today. What's up? You're not mad at me no more?

132
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:05,998
I'm not, but I can't speak for Miss Jackson.

133
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:08,701
She wants to see you in her office right now.

134
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:10,745
- I think that lady told on me.  - What did you do?

135
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,747
She thought I was smoking weed when I delivered her package.

136
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:14,613
- You smell like weed right now.  - Say word.

137
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,312
See. Look at you.

138
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,322
- Wait. Yo, let me ask you something.  - What?

139
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:20,188
Who was the dude that picked you up from work yesterday?

140
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,124
Who, Barton? He's just a friend.

141
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:24,220
- What did you say his name was?  - Barton.

142
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:25,526
- Barton?  - Hmm.

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,589
His name is Barton?

144
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:27,693
Mmm-hmm.

145
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,101
You fucking him?

146
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:32,040
Hold up. Excuse you. Don't worry about who I'm fucking.

147
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:34,077
We broke up a week ago.

148
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,477
I mean, he's got a nice car but he ain't got nothing on me.

149
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:41,782
Look, Leo. I'm sorry, but I'm in love. So do what you want to do with that.

150
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:44,987
You should go ahead and quit this job.

151
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,258
I should've never got that bitch this job! I should have never got...

152
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,695
Leo! Get in here!

153
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,310
- I got a couple more boxes...  - Now! God damn it!

154
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,214
I got a call from a woman yesterday that said when she answered her door

155
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,450
you were there with a joint in your mouth!

156
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,992
A lady said that about me?

157
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:13,026
- You know I don't smoke joints.  - Boy, don't get stupid on me.

158
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:15,191
What? Do you think nobody knows you smoke around here?

159
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:17,292
Walking around with them little sticks in your mouth,

160
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,304
breath stinking about weed.

161
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:23,366
Ain't nobody stupid around here. Put your shirt in! Get in.

162
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:26,279
I don't know what to do with you. I'm tired of talking.

163
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:28,579
It's time for you to stop and take a look at the big picture,

164
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,517
'cause I'm about to fire your ass.

165
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:35,049
Oh, shit! You're gonna fire me? Mom! Don't fire me. Please, Mom. I'm sorry.

166
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:37,962
Yeah, you're always sorry. Sit your sorry ass down.

167
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,862
But this time I mean it. I'm dead serious.

168
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:44,167
You will never hear a negative thing about me ever, ever, ever again, Mom.

169
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,264
Please, I need this job.

170
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:48,642
Yeah. And I need it, too, but you're making me look bad.

171
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,411
Please. Please, Mom. I'm your son.

172
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,714
What you gonna do? You're gonna throw me out on the street?

173
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:57,622
You're gonna throw your only son out on the street, Mom? Please?

174
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,522
Mommy. Mommy?

175
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:04,592
- One more time, you hear me?  - No more times. How about that?

176
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:09,834
If I get one call about you, you are fired! Better you than me.

177
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,432
You know, I think that's fair, Mommy.

178
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,569
Don't mommy me. Look at Eric.

179
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:18,485
Yes, Eric.

180
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:21,822
Does Eric live at home with his momma?

181
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:22,915
- No.  - No.

182
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:27,191
Eric comes in here on time to do his work, to take care of business.

183
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:32,329
You're absolutely right, Mom. And you know what? It's getting late,

184
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:35,399
so I need to get these packages out before...

185
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:38,469
And if I get one call about you, just one...

186
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:41,141
Mom, you're not gonna get any more complaints. That's it.

187
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:42,913
Get out of my office.

188
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:46,047
- I love you.  - Get out of my office!

189
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:58,730
- Man, this is some bullshit.  - You scared?

190
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,274
- Who?  - You.

191
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:02,334
I ain't scared of nobody.

192
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,937
When this motherfucker wake up, he gotta get the fuck out of here.

193
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:07,814
You're gonna laugh about it. You can get the fuck out of here right now.

194
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:11,255
I'm not going nowhere. I done paid a couple of bills up in this bitch.

195
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:19,934
You all motherfuckers need to learn how to earn your keep around here.

196
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:25,937
Hell, yeah, I'm tired of being the only motherfucker get the jobs around here.

197
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:28,503
Try to make it so three motherfuckers could eat.

198
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:30,049
We can't even pay the rent.

199
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:31,948
Yeah, we pretty much done did everything there is...

200
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,821
I mean, if you're running a store, all you can get is a G?

201
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:38,958
Then you gotta try to split that shit three ways.

202
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,899
And, look, I'm sorry. I think my life is worth more than $300, you know what I'm saying?

203
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,596
I mean, the way you all motherfuckers out here now,

204
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,970
we run up on these drug dealers, it's too dangerous,

205
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,100
- 'cause y'all say my name so much.  - I got it, Guch!

206
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,636
I hear Guch, Guch, Guch, Guch, Guch, Guch, Guch.

207
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:56,708
Let's play a game, man. Guch.

208
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,762
Hey, yo, my man. Elevator work?

209
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:05,387
Well, sometimes.

210
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:07,558
Ain't this about a bitch?

211
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:15,738
- Hey, daddy.  - Yeah!

212
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:16,801
Hey, catch me.

213
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:19,882
What? What?

214
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,449
You gotta be kidding me. The elevator works?

215
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,220
Yeah, man, sometimes.

216
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,432
You can't fuck with me. You can't fuck with me.

217
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:35,969
I'll punch that little tight-ass T-shirt off of you.

218
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:39,169
Who the man now? Who the man now?

219
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:42,310
Hold that. Yeah. Hold that.

220
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,497
- Go, go, go, go, go.  - I'm on your ass, boy.

221
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,300
I'm on your ass, boy. Hold this.

222
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,775
Package for Gonzales!

223
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:06,676
Lazy motherfuckers.

224
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:07,873
Yo!

225
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:12,478
What the fuck you knocking like the police for, man?

226
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,023
Package for Gonzales.

227
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:16,052
Yeah.

228
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,128
It's heavy.

229
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,023
I'm gonna need you to sign.

230
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,662
If you can sign right there, it'll be great.

231
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,674
You know you smell like weed, right?

232
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:34,145
Mmm-hmm.

233
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:36,743
All right, bro.

234
00:13:36,822 --> 00:13:38,449
No, I got my hands full.

235
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:50,739
Leo, you get anything today?

236
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,035
- Nope.  - You're sure?

237
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,304
Yep.

238
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,410
Son of a bitch.

239
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:14,938
What's up? Nothing?

240
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,108
Maybe it's just late. It'll probably just come tomorrow.

241
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:21,615
Yeah. And who the hell is gonna sign for it tomorrow? Not me.

242
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:23,877
The Feds are probably all over that shit.

243
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:25,749
You know, I can't believe you gave them this address.

244
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:28,690
You wasn't here. He just called up and he asked for an address. I didn't know.

245
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,748
Exactly.

246
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,123
"I don't know." That's what you say.

247
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,859
He probably didn't even send it, and you're here spazzing out for no reason.

248
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:35,958
I know he did.

249
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:38,529
He gave me the tracking number and everything. It's right here.

250
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,303
Call him and have him track it.

251
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:44,437
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I don't wanna make him nervous.

252
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,350
You track it.

253
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,358
Come on, baby, I need you to do this.

254
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,861
Please. Please. Please.

255
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,030
Oh, yeah. Got you.

256
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:01,227
- Okay.  - You got me?

257
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:04,933
Mmm-hmm. Give me the number. I'll track it for you.

258
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:07,101
I'm just gonna stay here in case anything comes.

259
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,441
But as soon as you find out anything hurry back,

260
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:11,209
because I need to know what's up.

261
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,979
To track a package, press one.

262
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:19,321
- Fuck. What the hell are you doing?  - You said track it!

263
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:22,728
Not from the house phone. Are you crazy? Go to a pay phone.

264
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,759
Watch who you're talking to, Jes¨²s. I'm not one of your little flunkies.

265
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:30,668
- And you're here burning my fucking eggs.  - Do you even know what all this means?

266
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,040
No, Jes¨²s, what does it mean? What does it mean?

267
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,341
- Our spot is hot because of you.  - Our spot is hot.

268
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:35,403
How is our spot hot?

269
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:37,677
We've been caught with shit before.

270
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:41,154
Not here. And this ain't no small shit they're gonna let slide.

271
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:45,662
Mira, this could be the last day of your life. Fuck those eggs.

272
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:51,361
- Now, pick it up!  - Fuck you!

273
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:53,428
All right. Fuck you, Jes¨²s!

274
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,572
Go ahead!

275
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,680
And it's Jesus to you, bitch!

276
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:05,815
Your mother is the bitch! Okay?

277
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,357
Get the fuck out of here!

278
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,018
I'm a beast!

279
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:12,490
You refer to me as the champ, boy.

280
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:17,366
What is this?

281
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:20,237
I don't know. Hassie brought that bullshit in here.

282
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,299
Hassie!

283
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:23,504
You see what I'm saying about this motherfucker?

284
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:26,311
This is how we gonna end up, man. Smoke, shit, sleep.

285
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,284
Yeah. What's up with this, though? You got that knife? Open this.

286
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,189
This motherfucker heavy, man.

287
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:35,790
Did you order this shit?

288
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:42,165
- Shit, what is this?  - I don't know what the hell that is.

289
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:48,004
Oh! Shit!

290
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:53,211
What the fuck?

291
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:54,982
God.

292
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:00,391
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

293
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:02,433
Man. Come on, man.

294
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:06,730
I know... I know this ain't what I think it is.

295
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,407
- Oh, my God.  - Hold on, man.

296
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:12,675
- I'll be damned. Hold on. Hold on.  - Is this what I think it is?

297
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:15,974
I got to be motherfucking dreaming.

298
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:18,886
It's gotta be that. Hell, yeah.

299
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:25,492
- Shit, I can't believe this.  - Is it the thing?

300
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:28,362
It's the thing?

301
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,366
Is it?

302
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:37,805
- It is! Holy fuck. Holy. Holy. Holy.  - Yes! Yes! Yes!

303
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:38,871
- Am I dreaming this?  - Yes.

304
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:40,246
No, no, no. This is too much like a dream.

305
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:42,411
- Where did this come from?  - God sent that.

306
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:47,826
- God, man. What's on the box?  - I don't know.

307
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:50,160
But, man, this is a blessing, man. We ain't got no money.

308
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,289
Damn!

309
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,631
- This some Cali shit.  - They sent this shit to us.

310
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:56,399
Shit. They sent it to us. Now it's mine. Shit.

311
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:59,376
- Mine, too.  - Wait a minute. Apartment 303?

312
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:05,408
Oh, shit! Dude, that's them Puerto Rican dudes across the hall.

313
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:09,382
We should have been and hit them. They was getting it like that?

314
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,221
And I want that bitch they got over there.

315
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:14,327
You know what? We need to clean this shit up.

316
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:16,593
God! I can't believe it. I'm getting a new Escalade.

317
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:18,397
They're gonna come over here for sure looking for this shit.

318
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:20,462
If they do, tell them we took this shit back to the station.

319
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:24,135
I'm telling you, I'm selling ounces, quarter ounces, eight balls, 50s, 20s.

320
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,871
Put the trash in that. You hear me right this time?

321
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:29,349
- Throw the trash in that.  - I hear you.

322
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,148
About 10 bricks.

323
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,885
There's 10 of them. Look at them. Solid.

324
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,827
- Three, four...  - What's up with him?

325
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:42,494
He's asleep, man. You snooze, you lose, man.

326
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:43,866
You know what, matter of fact?

327
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:45,530
We'll tell him it was three, we'll give him one.

328
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:47,438
We'll split nine. This is your boy anyway.

329
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,675
# We're getting money. We're getting money. We're getting money. We're getting money. #

330
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:56,651
Hey, man. I know who we can sell this shit to.

331
00:18:56,722 --> 00:18:57,780
Who?

332
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:01,150
My cousin Shavoo.

333
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:02,955
- Who?  - Shavoo.

334
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,827
Ohhh! I forgot about...

335
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,959
- Wait a minute. Your cousin?  - Yeah, yeah.

336
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:08,435
How come we ain't rob him?

337
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:10,662
'Cause he's my cousin, Guch.

338
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:13,768
So what he your cousin? You robbed my cousin.

339
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:16,177
It was your idea to rob your fucking cousin. Now, you're gonna...

340
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,978
You're supposed to have some ideas to rob your cousin.

341
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,589
Shit, we ain't got to rob him now. He'll buy all that shit.

342
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,823
Oh, yeah? How you know that?

343
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:30,298
Oh! Man, trust me. The dude is a cocaine cowboy.

344
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:33,063
He'll turn 10 into 20. I seen him do it before.

345
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,127
Twenty? How?

346
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,265
Look, man, I used to work for him, all right?

347
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,366
About two years ago.

348
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,939
One time, I had to re-up. He tells me to pick up some acetone

349
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,506
and meet him down at the apartment down in Puerto Rican ville.

350
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:47,614
One of his bitch's cribs, I guess. I'm like, "Acetone?"

351
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:52,423
Anyway, I get there. The bitch open up the door for me.

352
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:55,490
It was so much dust coming out of her house,

353
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,695
I thought the fucking kitchen was on fire.

354
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:02,038
She pulls me in quickly, lock the door. Now I'm getting nervous.

355
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,376
I walk in the living room and who I see? Buddy.

356
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,917
- Buddy? Who's that?  - Buddy.

357
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,351
Buddy's his right-hand man.

358
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,911
I been around this guy and he won't tell me his name.

359
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:12,980
So I just call him Buddy.

360
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:14,548
- Won't tell you his name?  - Yeah.

361
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:15,959
What kind of shit is that? You asked him?

362
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:19,522
Plenty of times, and the motherfucker still won't tell me his name.

363
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,263
So, anyway, where was I? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

364
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,276
I see Buddy knee deep up into a pile of coke this high,

365
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:30,837
mixing all this powder, dust is everywhere.

366
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:34,375
Shavoo comes out the bathroom, starts pushing me back off in the door.

367
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:39,287
I look around and see this machine. That's when it hit me.

368
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:41,896
This motherfucker's making this shit.

369
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,090
- Making it?  - Making the shit.

370
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,330
They done fucked around, hooked up with them Dominicans.

371
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:49,601
Them Dominicans then showed him them re-rock machines.

372
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:53,806
They're compressing the shit, turning two into four and four into more.

373
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:55,746
That's how I know they gonna buy them.

374
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:59,151
Good. He better. Plus, if he don't buy them,

375
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:02,214
I'm gonna rob the motherfucker next week for sure. Call him.

376
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:16,734
- What?  - Don't "what" me, get up.

377
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:21,449
- Who this?  - It's Bro.

378
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,177
Oh! What up, man?

379
00:21:23,253 --> 00:21:27,088
I'm what's up, man. Hey, look, we need to talk, for real.

380
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,093
- About what?  - Listen.

381
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:30,990
Hey, boy, I got these bad...

382
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:33,898
Whoa! Hold up. Come on, dawg, watch your language

383
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:36,596
I know, I know. I don't curse. Look, check this out.

384
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,663
I got 10 bad bitches at the crib

385
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:40,767

386
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:42,236
Word? Really?

387
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:44,372
How do they look?

388
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:45,438
Beautiful.

389
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:47,075
And you're gonna love them.

390
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:48,142
They're your type of bitches.

391
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:52,089
Well, you know me, Bro.

392
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,252
I don't care how bad the bitch is.

393
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:56,230
If she too old, I ain't pulling my dick out.

394
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,794
Man, they're about as young as they come.

395
00:21:58,869 --> 00:21:59,858
You dig what I'm saying?

396
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:02,529

398
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:06,538
Let me ask you something, Bro.

399
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:07,705
How did you get 10 bitches?

400
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:08,770
Because I get bitches.

401
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,614
Look, check this out, if you and your boys

402
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:12,880

00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:14,922

404
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:16,856

405
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:18,826
- You dig?  - Yeah. I dig.

406
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:22,866
All right, so keep them there. I want to see them. I'll be there in like a minute.

407
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:24,095
All right, dawg.

408
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,159
Who the fuck is that?

409
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:28,071
- That's what's up. All right.  - All right.

410
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:30,968
What?

411
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:37,951
What the fuck is this?

412
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,956
Merry Christmas to whoever gets that.

413
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,396
Giantto.

414
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,561
I want to.

415
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,040
Smoking. Yes, sir. I'm liking that.

416
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:08,693
Hey, yo, what the fuck you doing in here?

417
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,788
Is that fucking funny? Is that fucking funny?

418
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:14,827
I had a blade in my hand, asshole. Scrotum face. What's good?

419
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,869
Morning glory. That's my dude.

420
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:21,577
- Yes.  - You want some of that?

421
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:26,311
Yo, you keep fucking around, you're gonna get fired, man.

422
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:27,547
Shit, I ain't gonna get fired.

423
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,488
Yeah, you are. You're gonna get me fired.

424
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,685
You ain't gonna get fired. Your moms, she love you.

425
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:34,161
Yeah, well, she was about to fire my ass today.

426
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:35,528
I was thinking about your moms. How's she doing?

427
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,794
- Come on now.  - That came out wrong?

428
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:38,096
- Yeah.  - My bad.

429
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:40,797
- What she want to fire you for?  - That's another story.

430
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:42,898
Fuck this job. I hate this fucking job.

431
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:45,810
The only reason I got this job is to keep my P.O. off my back.

432
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,714
I shouldn't have fucked her. That pussy was good, though.

433
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:51,544
- You're fucking joking. Yeah.  - No, I'm not, man.

434
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,351
If I couldn't steal here, what the fuck would I want to work here for, man?

435
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:57,759
- Punk ass checks ain't paying my bills.  - That's what I'm saying.

436
00:23:57,829 --> 00:23:59,387
"That's what I'm saying"? What the fuck is you saying?

437
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:00,625
That's what I'm saying. I'm saying...

438
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,997
- I hate you, that's what I'm saying.  - Why?

439
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:03,832
I'm a hater. I'm a hater of you.

440
00:24:03,905 --> 00:24:06,135
What do you mean? Why? You live with a beautiful woman,

441
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:09,075
taking care of your bills, cooking your food,

442
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:10,908
doing your goddamn dirty-ass laundry.

443
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:12,608
I'm saying I'm trying to move out and I can't afford to.

444
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,552
Well, you get your balls up. Get in these boxes.

445
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,819
Who do you think I got it from?

446
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,689
- That's hot.  - How much do you think it pays for?

447
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,888
- What?  - 10K.

448
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:27,000
Gonna see my man Sandu Ajula, bing bong. Easy.

449
00:24:27,804 --> 00:24:30,534
Come on, man. You're in America. Steal something.

450
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:31,972
- No, man.  - Free money.

451
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:34,511
How many hands you think done touched these boxes

452
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,241
before we get them? What the fuck are they gonna say?

453
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,010
"You stole my shit"? I wish they would.

454
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:42,113
I'd be on Larry King crying, "This terrible discrimination after all these years..."

455
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,251
- Shit! Kiss my ass.  - Dude, you're acting like you rich.

456
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:47,887
- You are acting like you're rich, right now.  - No, I'm not. I'm acting like...

457
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:52,425
I'm not rich. Get on a level. Get with me. Feel me.

458
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:54,096
- You're bugging. I got boxes to load.  - Peace and love.

459
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:56,333
Oh! You got some boxes. What you got? What you got?

460
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:58,707
Chill, man. Chill. Be easy, all right?

461
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,372
- Yo, tell your moms I said peace.  - Yo.

462
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:03,713
I'm just saying. What, I can't appreciate your mom?

463
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,014
- Come on, man.  - That came out wrong.

464
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,782
My bad. Good things. Good things.

465
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:13,353
Shit.

466
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:25,040
To track a package, press one.

467
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:29,415
- You remember my cousin Brody?  - Used to work for you?

468
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,419
- Yeah.  - Yeah, a little bit.

469
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:35,359
Okay. Brody called me this morning, right?

470
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:38,497
Brody tells me he's got some bitches at his crib.

471
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:40,056
He want me to come check out.

472
00:25:40,135 --> 00:25:44,197
Shit. That's good. You know me, I'm always down to fuck some hoes.

473
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:47,301
Stop, man. I'm not talking about those kind of bitches.

474
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:51,042
I'm talking about "bitches" bitches.

475
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,750
Ah!

476
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
Some bricks.

477
00:26:00,996 --> 00:26:03,396
There's certain words you just can't throw around up in the whip.

478
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:05,799
Come on, Shav, what you thinking? Your joint is bugged?

479
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,430
Man, I'm telling you. I'm at the crib, I'm checking my phone,

480
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:12,774
I hear an echo every time I check it. Fucking Feds. Fucking Feds.

481
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:15,476
But anyway, he got 10 bitches. Ten.

482
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,744
Damn. How did he get 10?

483
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:19,650
Who knows? Brody, probably hit somebody.

484
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:20,814
That's why I got you rolling with me.

485
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,688
I don't trust those clown-ass boys for shit.

486
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,921
Hey, man, you know, I got your back.

487
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:29,229
School's out. Recess is over. Your boy don't play.

488
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:32,205
- I like that.  - Yeah.

489
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:39,142
Oh! B, I had to let him go, man. He was knocking my hustle.

490
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:43,186
I had to put family to the side for a minute.

491
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:45,654
Fire his ass.

492
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:48,488
You really, really got to watch him 'cause his crew just like him.

493
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:52,464
All they do is hunt down hustlers. That's why I got this vest on.

494
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:55,497
Shit.

495
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,302
Wish you'd told me earlier.

496
00:26:57,373 --> 00:27:00,866
I'd have worn mine in case anybody wanna act stupid.

497
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,685
Remember Deuce?

498
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:10,951
Deuce, Deuce.

499
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:13,687
- Big timer, West Philly.  - Yeah.

500
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:15,024
- Remember him?  - Yeah.

501
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:18,729
They got him.

502
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:20,834
They did that?

503
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:25,142
Yo! Yo! Motherfuckers. Better come in here and help me up, man.

504
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,644
I'm not fucking playing...

505
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,577
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!

506
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:32,312
Yo, you don't gotta be killing him.

507
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:34,912
Yo, Guch, he keeps popping the tape off with his mouth.

508
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:37,855
- Knock him out!  - Yeah.

509
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:41,360
Oh!

510
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:43,799
It's like that? Hold up, dawg. Hold on. Hold on.

511
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:47,133
Oh, shit!

512
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:50,375
Run your motherfucking mouth now, bitch.

513
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:53,144
You run your...

514
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:55,715
What you doing?

515
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:02,791
What you do, man? I told you to knock him out.

516
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:05,594
I thought you said cut it out.

517
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:15,835
The real fucked up thing about it was it was Deuce's own cousin Guch,

518
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:18,107
Brody's thieving ass boy.

519
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,945
303. Bingo.

520
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:25,192
- Yo, what you doing?  - I'm laying them out.

521
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:27,159
That's a good idea. That way if they want to rob our asses

522
00:28:27,228 --> 00:28:29,219
they ain't gotta look all over for the shit. They can just...

523
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:31,732
He's my cousin. Lighten up. He's not gonna rob.

524
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,769
I don't give a fuck if it's your cousin.

525
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,274
That's what my cousin said. Stop fucking around, man.

526
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:40,943
Hide them. Leave one of the motherfuckers out.

527
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,379
They can look at one of them, tell if it's good or not, right?

528
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,352
Damn. When they come with the money, they can see the rest of them.

529
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:53,255
All right, man, I hear you.

530
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:55,489
Open the door.

531
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:58,627
- What's up?  - My patience. What took you so long?

532
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:00,639
- I had to take a shit.  - That's what that smell is.

533
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:05,145
Guch, this is my cousin, Shavoo. Shavoo, this is Guch.

534
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:07,647
What's up, man? And you are?

535
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:10,417
Thirsty.

536
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:14,015
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, get my man something to drink.

537
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:19,962
So, what was your name again?

538
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,797
You got any beer?

539
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,360
Yeah. See if there's some beer in there for him.

540
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:27,335
I got your name. Your name's Shavoo.

541
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:30,912
- But I didn't get your name.  Your name is...  - My name.

542
00:29:31,415 --> 00:29:33,781
And yours is Goosh. Right?

543
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:37,721
- Guch.  - Guch. Nice to meet you, Guch.

544
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:43,791
I said cheeseburgers and onion rings.

545
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:45,733
Cousin, what the fuck is this?

546
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,428
Don't worry about this, man. You gotta excuse my man here.

547
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:48,971
He be riding all night. It's cool.

548
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,700
Look like he need to ride his ass to bed.

549
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:52,743
That's his bed that he sat on.

550
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:55,102
- You want this chair right here?  - I don't want shit.

551
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,206
I wanna stand right here and get down to business.

552
00:29:57,283 --> 00:30:01,186
- Where the bitches at?  - I got one bitch right here for you.

553
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:08,186
Got something I can...

554
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:11,665
My man.

555
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,009
Yeah. That's good shit.

556
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:21,810
You got 10 of these, cousin?

557
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:24,317
- I got nine of them like that.  - Yeah?

558
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:26,412
- Mmm-hmm. Make a nun get naked.  - Where they at, cousin?

559
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,617
Got them right here. Right here.

560
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:34,532
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

561
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:39,167
Boom!

562
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:41,965
Boom!

563
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:45,273
Yo, Bro, where'd you cop these jones from?

564
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,646
Man, we got some Puerto Ricans coming...

565
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:49,277
Look, fuck where it's from. We need to talk about where it's going.

566
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:51,447
'Cause they're leaving out of this motherfucker today.

567
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:54,220
Now, y'all can fuck around if y'all want and pass up the deal of a lifetime,

568
00:30:54,294 --> 00:30:57,753
Or y'all can stop bullshitting and start talking about the money.

569
00:30:57,832 --> 00:30:59,094
I got people I can call, make them come get...

570
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:00,396
Fuck them!

571
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:02,865
I'm your man.

572
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,868
Now you're talking.

573
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:07,810
How much you want for them, Guch?

574
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:11,810
Well, I know y'all probably

575
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:15,515
- Copping these like 23, 24.  - Right.

576
00:31:15,923 --> 00:31:20,190
So if you'll buy all these, I'll give you 20 apiece.

577
00:31:20,263 --> 00:31:22,663
Twenty apiece? Come on, you kind of high, Sosa.

578
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:24,200
Real high.

579
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:26,361
Me and my boy, we make a run in New York, get two for less than that.

580
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,033
Hopefully, y'all make it back. Ain't no risk here. This is no risk.

581
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:33,409
Ain't no risk here. Know mean?

582
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:35,972
How many cats you know in this city who cop 10 from the door?

583
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:37,882
I barely know any, so I know you don't.

584
00:31:38,253 --> 00:31:41,951
Check it out. Let me take these jones off your hands.

585
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,993
All profit. You know what I mean. All profit.

586
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:50,434
You give them to me for 15, I'll flip it. Put 150 grand in your pocket today.

587
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:53,268
- Today?  - Fuck that! Matter of fact, two hours.

588
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:54,739
Man...

589
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:55,798
All right.

590
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:58,810
- Just be cool, man.  - What's up?

591
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:00,110
What the fuck is the deal?

592
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,882
No, 15. Fifteen sounds good. That sounds like a deal.

593
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,653
- We'll take 15.  - Except

594
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,929
Y'all gotta be back here in two hours.

595
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:13,023
- Two hours, Shavoo.  - Done.

596
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:19,904
Yo, what y'all doing, man? What you doing?

597
00:32:20,377 --> 00:32:22,470
Drop this shit off, I'll be right back with your money.

598
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:23,707
Hell, no!

599
00:32:23,782 --> 00:32:25,113
What we look like? Boo-hoo the fool?

600
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:28,348
It's right here. When y'all get right back, then y'all can get it.

601
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:30,422
What are you talking about? You ain't got to worry.

602
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,049
It'll be sitting here right for you.

603
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:34,186
Y'all come back for the bitches later.

604
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:40,771
Don't worry about it. They'll be here when you get back.

605
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,306
- Shavoo.  - All right. Cool.

606
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:44,865
- And...  - Yeah, same here.

607
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:47,880
It's been real. Two hours.

608
00:32:48,415 --> 00:32:50,076
All right, Voo.

609
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,745
That's what's up.

610
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,417
So what you think?

611
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:58,256
I think we about to come up like a motherfucker.

612
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,559
You know how much shit I can make in there?

613
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:04,660
I ain't seen some jones that good since, what, '92, '93.

614
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:07,707
I'm getting that new Cadillac. I'm gonna have crushed velvet seats in.

615
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:10,768
I'm gonna keep that incense in it. Everybody gonna wanna ride with me,

616
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:12,073
and I'm gonna say "Nope."

617
00:33:12,148 --> 00:33:14,810
"You wasn't fucking with me when I ain't had no money."

618
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:16,079
Yes!

619
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,112
I'm gonna be clean in a bitch.

620
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:22,953
Now you know what we gotta do next, right?

621
00:33:24,731 --> 00:33:26,062
- Storage.  - Storage.

622
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:47,190
- Damn! What took you so long?  - The stupid phone is what took me so long.

623
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:49,456
- So what did he say?  - It kept saying...

624
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,465
This is not a valid tracking number.

625
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:52,660
Say your tracking number...

626
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:53,760
one character at a time...

627
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:55,931
Baby, fuck all that! Did you track it or not?

628
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:58,841
- 1V9...  - This is not a valid tracking number.

629
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,904
- Yo. No! No, I couldn't track it.  - Why not?

630
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:03,449
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Jes¨²s.

631
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:05,712
It kept cutting me off. It wouldn't let me say all the numbers.

632
00:34:05,787 --> 00:34:08,985
- Tracking number, one character...  - lf you shut up, I could finish.

633
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:10,787
All this time? What were you doing?

634
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:14,354
No! Not five, nine. Nine, you stupid bitch!

635
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:15,421
Tracking it!

636
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,059
Okay?

637
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,073
- Tracking it?  - Yes. Tracking it.

638
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:25,045
What is that? Garlic? Hmm?

639
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:28,773
That shit was good.

640
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:32,451
You got something to eat, didn't you? Didn't you?

641
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,455
Yes, Jes¨²s, I got something to eat. So what? I was hungry.

642
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:38,360
You shouldn't have spit on my food.

643
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:42,391
See, I give you one simple thing to do, and you even fuck that up!

644
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,804
The phone didn't work. That is not my fault.

645
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:49,268
Yeah. Whatever, man. It's never your fault.

646
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:07,165
- Hello?  - Jes¨²s.

647
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:09,465
Hola, Bodega.

648
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,338
- You got it, right?  - No, it ain't come yet.

649
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:16,274
- What do you mean it ain't come?  - It ain't come yet.

650
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:18,146
What the fuck you mean it ain't come yet?

651
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,653
I just tracked it right now. It says it was delivered a few hours ago.

652
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:23,350
- What? It ain't come here.  - Mmm-mmm.

653
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:25,758
I already saw the guy. He said we ain't get nothing today.

654
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:27,296
Ask your girlfriend if she signed for it.

655
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:29,195
- My girl's standing right here.  - No.

656
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:31,030
Then why the fuck is it saying it was delivered?

657
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:36,074
I don't know. I already saw the guy. He said we ain't get nothing.

658
00:35:36,142 --> 00:35:37,200
Who?

659
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:38,736
Oh!

660
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:39,871
That motherfucker!

661
00:35:39,948 --> 00:35:40,972
What motherfucker? What happened?

662
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:43,210
- He stole it!  - Who stole the shit?

663
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:45,254
The NDA dude. He had to.

664
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:48,223
That's why he had the buggy-eyed look on his face.

665
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:51,057
Look, Bodega, I'm gonna find this motherfucker. Trust me.

666
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,825
Yeah. You do that.

667
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:54,958
Because let me tell you, Jes¨²s, if you're lying to me,

668
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:58,233
You're gonna wish your name was Jesus, Jes¨²s.

669
00:36:00,643 --> 00:36:02,042
What happened? What'd he say?

670
00:36:02,111 --> 00:36:03,942
What happened? What happened? What happened?

671
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:06,676
- We gotta find this thief!  - What thief, Jes¨²s?

672
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:14,289
Motherfucker, is you loco? Huh? Taking my shit.

673
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:18,522
Taking Jesus' shit!

674
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,792
Huh?

675
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:22,597
This isn't gonna work.

676
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:25,937
Yeah.

677
00:36:27,045 --> 00:36:30,504
Motherfucker, you wanna die? Huh? Do you?

678
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:33,383
Where's my shit?

679
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,315
I shouldn't have to say that much. It just ain't scary.

680
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:40,761
Jes¨²s? What are you doing?

681
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,128
Where's my shit, motherfucker?

682
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:51,733
I'm gonna go try to catch him on the Ave.

683
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:54,213
- Where the fuck you going?  - With you, Jes¨²s.

684
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:55,510
- For what?  - What you mean "for what"?

685
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,642
I know you. You're fucking crazy.

686
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,851
Hey. Hey, ladies. Ladies, what's happening with y'all?

687
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:05,558
Hey, what's up, ladies? How y'all doing?

688
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:09,192
- He's so crazy. Is he trying to...  - Hey, I'm trying to holler. What's up?

689
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:12,672
Please, you work for NDA.

690
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:16,609
Oh! My bad. I thought y'all was hookers. Just trying to pick y'all up.

691
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,943
It's not like if we were, you could afford us anyway.

692
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,916
"If we were you couldn't afford us."

693
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:25,218
Listen here, all right, with your flat asses. I get the finger?

694
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,382
Yeah.

695
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:32,828
Forget that girl. For real.

696
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:37,170
I don't even need her. All I really need is my weed.

697
00:37:43,248 --> 00:37:46,012
Yo!

698
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:49,816
I know I got a joint up in here somewhere. Time to smoke a J.

699
00:37:51,994 --> 00:37:54,792
I need to get my ass to Shelton Ave and re-up.

700
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:01,401
Since we're getting the cheese, might as well get the compressor, too,

701
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:04,033
- While we in there.  - Shit, yeah.

702
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,907
You know, I been thinking, man.

703
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:10,384
I've been thinking about stopping this whole game, you know?

704
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:11,441
Calling it quits.

705
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,851
There you go.

706
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:16,188
No, I'm serious, man. I know I done said it plenty of times before.

707
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:20,560
A million times I done said it, but I'm for real this time. This is my stop.

708
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,827
You might as well flip one more for the road.

709
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:28,307
No, man. Jones is a dead end. I'm cool. I mean it.

710
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:30,640
I'm gonna cut through the grass, you know.

711
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,181
I'm gonna make my own path. I can't tell you where I'm going to land but...

712
00:38:36,587 --> 00:38:38,248
With 500 grand,

713
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,652
I'll be all right.

714
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:44,323
So, what's up? I mean,

715
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,895
you might as well come, too.

716
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,935
I ain't got enough to chill.

717
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:52,403
Chill don't pay the bills.

718
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,353
Well, sometimes, you gotta take a chance with what you got, B.

719
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,485
You know, there was a time big cat couldn't tell me shit either.

720
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,323
But look here, man, just promise me this.

721
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:14,030
Always remember what you're doing it for.

722
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:18,137
If it ain't worth dying for,

723
00:39:20,914 --> 00:39:22,211
you don't wanna be in it.

724
00:39:22,283 --> 00:39:25,276
I mean, in the end, that's all that really matters.

725
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:26,479
Know what I mean?

726
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:29,054
Know mean.

727
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,088
I feel like a free man already.

728
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:38,796
Shit.

729
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:42,104
Hey, Voo.

730
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:51,772
Oh, shit.

731
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:56,654
All right, look, the first place

732
00:39:56,724 --> 00:39:58,124
- we're gonna hit is the Ave.  - Okay.

733
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,095
Keep your eyes peeled for a gray NDA truck.

734
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,635
And you know I don't like you coming with me, so don't be wiling it out.

735
00:40:02,696 --> 00:40:04,856
Yo, man. You act like I don't know how to fucking act or something.

736
00:40:04,937 --> 00:40:07,627
You don't, all right? And if you ain't gonna listen to me,

737
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,178
then take your ass back up in the house.

738
00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:10,438
Calm down.

739
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:19,211
- Shit! Shit!  - Shut up, man.

740
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,382
- Why? Why?  - Calm down.

741
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:23,052
We gonna figure this shit out! We gonna figure this shit out, man.

742
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:24,613
Now calm the fuck down.

743
00:40:24,694 --> 00:40:27,525
- How much was here?  - A few hundred thou.

744
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:29,765
- A few hundred?  - Yeah.

745
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:32,266
- Shit, man.  - A few hundred.

746
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:35,997
I thought, all this time, I just knew you had more than that.

747
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:38,238
- I don't, all right?  - Come here, Shavoo. Come here.

748
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,179
Man, what the fuck?

749
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,551
- Who all knew about this joint?  - Nobody but you.

750
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:46,111
Well, shit, you know I ain't take it.

751
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:47,852
Shit.

752
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:50,853
Don't you?

753
00:40:51,934 --> 00:40:54,494
- Shav?  - Yeah, man. Look, man...

754
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:57,626
See! See! They got me thinking, man. I trust you. You know that.

755
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:58,866
Hi, guys.

756
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:01,307
What the fuck you looking at?

757
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,478
Nobody, man. He work here. Be cool. Be cool.

758
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:09,389
Yo, Shav, now, whoever came up in here, they had a car,

759
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,291
because they took the compressor and that's a heavy-ass motherfucker.

760
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:16,632
You ain't just walking up out here with that.

761
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:21,864
They rolled in here.

762
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:24,734
They put the compressor in the back and they rolled out.

763
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:29,667
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get that ass.

764
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,920
What the fuck is you doing?

765
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:41,191
Me? I'm just...

766
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:44,271
- What the fuck is you doing?  - I'm just leaning on here.

767
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:47,903
You know? I'm just like, leaning. You know.

768
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:51,244
- Know mean?  - Know mean?

769
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:53,445
Get your punk ass in here, motherfucker.

770
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:58,587
You know Allah, motherfucker?

771
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:03,959
God damn! Where the fuck you at?

772
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:07,120
Any other day, you see these motherfuckers all over the place.

773
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,100
- Today, not one fucking truck.  - Papi, calm down.

774
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:10,801
I'm not used to seeing you bitch like this.

775
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:12,572
You'd be bitching, too, if you knew what I know.

776
00:42:12,642 --> 00:42:15,543
Know what, Jesus? What are you talking about?

777
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:17,803
Okay. Remember Hector?

778
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:20,444
Yeah, that dude you used to work for. What about him?

779
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:24,046
That's right. One day he calls me up talking crazy,

780
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,247
thanking me and shit.

781
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:27,227
- Yo!  - Phew! Thank you, Jesus.

782
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:30,289
Yo, all the shit I gave you, go get it, bring it to the spot right now.

783
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:32,669
Yo, dawg, half that stuff is on the street, man.

784
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,101
No, I don't give a fuck where it's at. Go get it, bring it to the spot right now.

785
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:37,161
Yo, what...

786
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:44,174
I get there, and this big motherfucker answers the door.

787
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,057
Hey, look. Your friend is here.

788
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,099
- Is it all there?  - No. Not even half.

789
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,381
Your name is Jesus?

790
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:08,412
- Jesus.  - Jesus.

791
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:13,784
My name is Bodega Diablo. This is my associate, Rhino.

792
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,915
I call him the Grim Reaper.

793
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:21,327
And you start lying to me, you're gonna know why.

794
00:43:21,397 --> 00:43:22,867
You know, it's funny,

795
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:24,497
just talking to your friend here for a little while,

796
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:28,338
It seems like I've known you all my life.

797
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:31,740
I know about your mother. I even know about your father.

798
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:34,221
- Fuck. How?  - God bless his soul.

799
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:35,681
Now I...

800
00:43:36,692 --> 00:43:41,023
No. You need to be straight up with me right about now.

801
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:44,094
A couple of days ago, I sent your friend here a package.

802
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:47,226
After a long talk, he told me that he never got it.

803
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:49,206
- He says you have it.  - Me?

804
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:50,267
Shut the fuck up!

805
00:43:52,248 --> 00:43:53,768
Shut the fuck up!

806
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:56,709
Now where's my shit?

807
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,250
I almost shit on myself.

808
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:04,152
The last thing I wanted to do is to tell this man that I don't have his shit.

809
00:44:04,222 --> 00:44:06,562
Right, right. So what did you say?

810
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:10,124
I didn't bite my tongue like no bitch. I told him the truth.

811
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:13,505
Look, this motherfucker right here...

812
00:44:13,575 --> 00:44:15,875
I look him dead in the eyes and I said,

813
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:18,506
Look, I don't know what Hector told you, but I don't think my friend

814
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:20,407
had anything to do with your shit being stolen.

815
00:44:20,478 --> 00:44:22,108
I've known this guy my whole life.

816
00:44:22,189 --> 00:44:25,120
One thing I can bet my life on is that he ain't no thief.

817
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,351
Now whatever it takes, we'll get your money back.

818
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:29,921
Just let my friend go.

819
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:31,391
Damn, baby, you said that shit?

820
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:34,333
You fucking right I said that shit, and then check this out.

821
00:44:34,403 --> 00:44:35,763
He had the nerve to say...

822
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,163
Shut up!

823
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:42,605
Your boss, he's fired, okay? You now work for me.

824
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:45,236
I'm standing there thinking, I gotta be out of my goddamn mind...

825
00:44:45,317 --> 00:44:46,717
It's cool with me man. Whatever you say.

826
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:50,378
... if you think I'm gonna work for a piece of shit Mexican ass motherfucker like you.

827
00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:52,049
- Hell, no.  - For what?

828
00:44:52,129 --> 00:44:55,360
So I can end up like this? You're fucking crazy.

829
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,490
So I looked him dead in the eyes,

830
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,161
and I said what any real motherfucker would have said.

831
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:01,702
What did you say?

832
00:45:07,445 --> 00:45:08,605
Yes, sir.

833
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:13,816
Shit, I ain't stupid, now. A Cali connect, exactly what I needed.

834
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:15,077
And that's what I'm talking about.

835
00:45:15,157 --> 00:45:17,247
Yo, baby! Yo, that's him right there!

836
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:19,028
- Ain't that him?  - Shit!

837
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:31,343
Oh, shit! That's gotta be him. That's gotta be him, yo.

838
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:34,284
- Give me the shotgun. This motherfucker...  - Here.

839
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:37,915
Stay your ass in the car! You hear me? Stay in the car!

840
00:45:38,826 --> 00:45:40,046
Stay in the car!

841
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,728
Where's my shit, motherfucker?

842
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:47,458
Sir, do you have an account with NDA?

843
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:49,659
Don't be playing with me. You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

844
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,170
Fuck that shit.

845
00:45:52,341 --> 00:45:55,872
Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Listen. Listen. Just hold tight.

846
00:45:55,942 --> 00:45:58,883
Just don't report me. You can take that.

847
00:45:58,953 --> 00:46:00,543
You done sold that shit already?

848
00:46:00,614 --> 00:46:02,104
I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't...

849
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:03,214
Oh!

850
00:46:03,285 --> 00:46:04,725
- No, you don't know what the...  - No.

851
00:46:04,785 --> 00:46:06,555
You know what the fuck I'm talking about!

852
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:07,646
Huh?

853
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:09,996
- Don't lie to me!  - Chi.

854
00:46:10,497 --> 00:46:12,727
- I don't know what you're talking about.  - You don't know?

855
00:46:12,798 --> 00:46:14,058
- No.  - No? Okay.

856
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,109
Listen, we don't keep cash in the truck.

857
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,770
You can just take this because it's all I got.

858
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,740
What the fuck is this? Huh?

859
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:24,081
Fake gold.

860
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:28,653
- I don't wear fake gold.  - I wasn't trying to insult you.

861
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:31,714
- Turn around! Now!  - Okay. Okay. I'm turning around.

862
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:34,485
- All the way.  - Chi?

863
00:46:34,566 --> 00:46:36,226
- What?  - What the hell are you doing here?

864
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:38,326
You were taking too fucking long.

865
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:41,938
- Turn around.  - You said all the way.

866
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,868
- What the fuck is wrong with you?  - I'm sorry, okay.

867
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:44,929
Chi.

868
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:48,100
- What? What?  - I don't even think that's him.

869
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:51,141
What do you mean that's not him?

870
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:52,622
- That's not him.  - It's not me.

871
00:46:54,123 --> 00:46:56,383
Chi, just relax.

872
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:00,654
- It's cool.  - Now what? What now?

873
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,525
Let's get the hell out of here.

874
00:47:04,006 --> 00:47:05,196
What about this?

875
00:47:05,277 --> 00:47:07,237
Take that shit. I'll rock it.

876
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:08,777
Can I say one thing?

877
00:47:08,848 --> 00:47:11,679
- What?  - No disrespect. No disrespect.

878
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:15,920
I like your outfit. You look very nice. I like your shoes. I like your top.

879
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:17,480
- The pants.  - Thank you.

880
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:20,021
Get your ass out of the truck. Now!

881
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,412
Turn the fuck around.

882
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:25,523
What the fuck is wrong with you? "Nice outfit."

883
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,749
Damn that bitch is bad.

884
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,190
Hello? Shavoo?

885
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,990
Oh, man, damn. Don't say that, man.

886
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,000
- What, what?  - Shut the fuck up and chill.

887
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,730
All right, man, I guess. All right. Go on.

888
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,900
- Damn.  - What the fuck he say?

889
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,700
That was Shavoo, man. Something came up.

890
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,740
He said he ain't nothing gonna pop off till the morning.

891
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,640
Oh! Ain't that a bitch? See, that's what I'm talking about.

892
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:08,170
- What happened to that two hour shit?  - I don't know. Shit.

893
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,340
That's what I fucking mean, man.

894
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,250
I'm glad I didn't let the motherfuckers take the package out of here.

895
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,180
Just be cool, man. Everything will work out.

896
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,990
Ain't no "be cool" shit, man. A lot could happen by tomorrow morning.

897
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,180
This motherfucker right here might wake up.

898
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,590
Please, he ain't waking up.

899
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,820
I think that motherfucker's trying to set us up, man.

900
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,990
He's not gonna set us up, man. It's my cousin. I keep telling you, man.

901
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,730
Now, look, if he said by tomorrow, tomorrow it'll be. I know.

902
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,740
Okay, cool! What if he say two hours? What do that mean?

903
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,870
That mean we celebrate, baby. You know what I'm saying?

904
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,810
You know the little freak chick, Kira, right?

905
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,040
I'm gonna call her and a couple of her little friends over, you know what I'm saying?

906
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,250
Have them come over tonight, tighten us up.

907
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,220
By tomorrow, we be ready, baby.

908
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,160
We'll be busting four and five nuts, we'll be ready to get that money, honey.

909
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,420
- I'm gonna call her right here.  - You know which one I like,

910
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,060
that young Chinatown...

911
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,290
We gonna bend her, spin her and go up in her!

912
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,600
Tell her there ain't no bullshit, man. Tell her no bullshit going on.

913
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,030
Hey, what's up? What y'all doing?

914
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,800
Hey, why don't you get a couple of your little girls

915
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,340
and why don't y'all swing through here

916
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,210
and do something strange for a little piece of change?

917
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,770
Look...

918
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,390
Look, I don't know what you're talking about...

919
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,290
- Yo, Shav. What you got there?  - Please...

920
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,880
Got some acetone. "Extremely flammable liquid..."

921
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,130
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay! I'll tell you! I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

922
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,290
It wasn't me. It wasn't me. But I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

923
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,670
Who took my shit?

924
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,870
You took my shit, didn't you?

925
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,770
It wasn't me. It wasn't me, but I'll tell you who it is. I'll tell you.

926
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,370
Please. Please. Okay. Okay.

927
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,910
So, what you doing tonight, baby?

928
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:52,640
Huh?

929
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:57,710
What would you say if we took a helicopter ride to AC

930
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,280
and gambled a little bit?

931
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,550
No, you're funny girl. No, all this here is just a front, baby.

932
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,960
I'm balling, baby. I'm balling.

933
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,370
Yo, dang, man, let me call you back.

934
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,760
Hey, brother, how can I help you?

935
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,100
What up, man?

936
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,970
Wade, right?

937
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,840
- Yeah, Wade.  - Cool.

938
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,540
- Let me get some rope.  - Rope.

939
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,140
And some tape.

940
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,090
And some tape. Here you go, bro.

941
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,190
Duct tape would be better.

942
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,990
- Duct tape. Okay. Got that.  - Yup. I need duct tape.

943
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:41,130
Here you go, brother. Duct tape. I'll take that for you.

944
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,530
And a padlock. How could I forget a padlock?

945
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,540
Padlock. Here it is.

946
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,040
- Cool.  - That's what's up.

947
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,640
It's a good one?

948
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,740
Yeah, that's a good one, man. Everybody get that one.

949
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,370
Okay. Cool.

950
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:59,080
- I got my rope, padlock, tape.  - Is that it, brother?

951
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,990
- And I'm gonna need my money.  - What the fuck is you talking about?

952
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,790
Man, we don't even do that up in here, man. I don't know what you're talking...

953
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,760
Before you start all that lying and shit,

954
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,260
let me paint a picture for you, where my head is at right now.

955
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,340
I need you to feel me.

956
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,680
You talking to a brother that just lost everything,

957
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:31,770
and picture he knows for a fact that you took it.

958
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,350
So, actually, I want you to... No, fuck that. I can't wait for you to lie about it.

959
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,890
You feel me?

960
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,730
Yo, Voo, you good?

961
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,970
Yep. We good.

962
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,010
We all good.

963
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,940
Motherfucker, what you relaxing for? This shit ain't over.

964
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,310
Oh! Motherfucker...

965
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,220
You know what that one told me?

966
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:15,160
He told me this padlock was the best padlock in the joint.

967
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,920
- Yeah?  - Yeah, you told me that, remember?

968
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,030
He knows his shit. You can't cut them.

969
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,230
- No?  - No.

970
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,170
I can't breathe.

971
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,720
That's crazy. You see this bitch?

972
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,230
Sparrow. What's good, buddy?

973
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,130
What's up? What's up?

974
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,360
- What's up? What's up, Leo?  - What's up, Cass?

975
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,170
- All right.  - Good to see you.

976
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,110
- Where the weed at?  - Got it right here. What you looking for?

977
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,610
What you got? You got dimes? Dubs? What's up?

978
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,370
I'm all out of dimes. Only got...

979
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,640
But you don't want that, though, man.

980
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,700
No.

981
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,050
I only got dubs left. What you looking for?

982
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,420
Let me get two dubs. That's what's up.

983
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:15,750
- Two of them?  - Yeah.

984
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,810
I've got you.

985
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,080
- Here you go, homey. Appreciate it.  - No doubt.

986
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,490
Everything good?

987
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:24,090
It's gravy, but...

988
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,530
I know they a little small because they was in my pocket.

989
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,090
They smashed down, but it ain't the size of the boat,

990
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:32,230
it's the motion in the ocean. That shit be flowing. Trust me.

991
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,330
Look, I think you should get back to work ASAP.

992
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,100
- Seriously.  - Yo!

993
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,540
- Get back to work, homey.  - Yo! Get... Oh, man.

994
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,210
That's crazy.

995
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,020
- Hello?  - Where the fuck you been?

996
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,890
- I've been calling all fucking day, man.  - I've been out looking for the guy, man.

997
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,330
What happened? Did you find him?

998
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,690
Listen, man, I looked everywhere. I can't find him, look, but...

999
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:06,960
He hung up.

1000
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,300
You stupid motherfucker. You want to play games?

1001
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,600
Okay. I'll play.

1002
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,280
Okay.

1003
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,120
We're gonna be all right.

1004
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,850
I'm gonna protect you.

1005
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,760
Rhino!

1006
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,260
Pack our bags. We're going to Philly.

1007
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:34,690
Hmm.

1008
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,700
Hello! Hello?

1009
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,340
Hello! Hello?

1010
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,940
Shit!

1011
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,140
- Chi! Chi! Wake up!  - What?

1012
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,210
Yo, I'm about to go find this puto while it's still early.

1013
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,250
- What puta?  - Qu¨¦ puta? The fucking NDA guy.

1014
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,650
He's out there. I can smell him.

1015
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,850
- I'm coming with you.  - Oh, no. After yesterday? Uh-uh!

1016
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:13,720
I am not staying here by myself.

1017
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,990
Jes¨²s, t¨² est¨¢s loco if you think they're gonna kill me.

1018
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,120
I wanna live. I'm not fucking staying here.

1019
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,900
- Yo, I think Bodega just called.  - Why? What he say?

1020
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,800
Motherfucker ain't say nothing, man. He just hung up.

1021
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,740
I know that was him, though. Trying to scare somebody.

1022
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,610
- I don't know who the fuck he thinks he is.  - Hell, no.

1023
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,700
I ain't no motherfucking Hector. I ain't no bitch.

1024
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,270
- I'm motherfucking Jesus.  - That's right, baby.

1025
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,980
- I'm gonna fuck him up!  - Yes, you will, baby.

1026
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,180
You fuck him up, but before you talk about fucking anybody,

1027
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,740
why don't you check the door? Maybe NDA left a note about the package.

1028
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,810
If he thinks I'm bowing down to him, he's crazy.

1029
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:48,720
- I'll bring him war. I will fuck him up.  - Yes, baby, you fuck him up.

1030
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,290
- Oh, shit.  - Fuck who up?

1031
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,870
The guy. The guy, man. That's what I was about to go do now.

1032
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,430
Yo, what the fuck is...

1033
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,510
What's going on?

1034
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,340
What guy?

1035
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,040
The NDA guy, man.

1036
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,080
That's who I was about to go fuck up. Right?

1037
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,710
Oh! Yeah, yeah. He was.

1038
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,950
Well, let's go. You, too.

1039
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,990
Me? Why me? I ain't got nothing to do with this.

1040
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,930
Is that right? We'll see about that. Now get dressed.

1041
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,360
Get dressed!

1042
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,180
We're gonna need more of these.

1043
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,920
Yeah, man, no problem.

1044
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,550
I'll be there in a minute.

1045
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,220
Yes! They on their way.

1046
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,160
Man, just think, man, when we get that money,

1047
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,170
we can get this place fixed up, you know what I'm saying?

1048
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,900
The way we want to, you know.

1049
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,670
Man, fuck this place, man. I'm getting me a new spot, man.

1050
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,470
I'm tired of living with you all.

1051
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,700
You're getting brand-new already, huh?

1052
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,840
Brand-new? What you talking about, man? Shit.

1053
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,220
Man, you all lucky I don't take all this stuff. I stole all of it.

1054
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,840
What the fuck are you doing?

1055
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:26,950
I'm just putting a few mousetraps around this motherfucker.

1056
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,830
Just in case motherfuckers try some shit, they have another thing coming.

1057
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,870
I told you, motherfucker, he ain't gonna do nothing.

1058
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,900
How many times I gotta tell you that?

1059
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:38,440
What're you talking about, man? I don't fucking know them. You know them.

1060
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,910
If you think for one second that I'm gonna be in here ass-naked

1061
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:44,770
with 10 bricks in one hand and my dick in the other, you fucking crazy.

1062
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,010
Let me explain something to you. Number one, I ain't no bitch!

1063
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,380
And if they try anything around here, they gonna have to kill me.

1064
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:55,280
Well, thank you, 'cause they're gonna have to kill me, too.

1065
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,050
That's my family, Guch. I told you. He ain't gonna try nothing.

1066
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,420
I grew up with him. I know his mom. I know his daddy.

1067
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,220
I know everybody in the motherfucking family.

1068
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,390
Man, that shit don't mean nothing to me, man!

1069
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,630
You don't never let your guard down talking about family. Fuck that!

1070
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,070
This ain't no fucking game. Ten bricks is 10 bricks!

1071
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,040
A hustler will kill you for that. I would!

1072
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,140
You'll kill me?

1073
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,580
You know I don't mean that bullshit, man. I ain't even say that shit like that.

1074
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:27,950
- No.  - No, man,

1075
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,680
- don't even try that shit on me, man.  - Mmm-hmm.

1076
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,090
I said somebody else would kill you. That's what I was saying.

1077
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,090
A motherfucker would kill you for one. You already know that.

1078
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,150
You're one of them motherfuckers.

1079
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,470
I hear you.

1080
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,910
You! Get your ass in here.

1081
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,520
Oh, God.

1082
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,100
All right. Make it rain.

1083
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,660
No, no, no. Give me that. Give me that.

1084
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,140
Man, I hope this boy don't act stupid.

1085
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:30,350
- Now you get the money.  - Got it.

1086
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:34,890
- What the fuck is that?  - What do you mean? It's a gun.

1087
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:38,580
For real? I thought it was a pogo stick. No shit it's a gun.

1088
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:39,680
What are you doing with that, B?

1089
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,450
You want the whole neighborhood to know what we're gonna do up in this joint?

1090
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:43,790
- Well...  - Come on, man.

1091
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,330
I'm just saying, them cats start firing up there,

1092
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,870
I don't want to be the only one without heat.

1093
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:51,960
Well, hide it. Come on. Hide that. For real.

1094
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,630
But, B, let me ask you something.

1095
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,540
We get to firing up there, like you say, right?

1096
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,640
You think you're gonna be able to pull that joint out in time?

1097
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:04,050
Fuck pulling it out. I shoot the motherfuckers through the bag.

1098
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,250
You can't even get the motherfucker in the bag.

1099
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,220
I show you better than I can tell you.

1100
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,290
You think I'm playing with you? Where is it?

1101
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,230
I swear to God I don't know where it is. I swear to Jesus.

1102
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,000
Don't be swearing on me, you lying piece of shit.

1103
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,100
What's your name?

1104
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,570
Leo.

1105
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,050
Now, yesterday you delivered a box to where?

1106
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,210
7500 Wissahickon Avenue.

1107
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,240
And I know it was in your truck, but for some reason it never got there.

1108
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,020
Now somewhere from here to there, it got lost.

1109
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,280
And I know you know where.

1110
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,420
- I swear to God...  - And listen!

1111
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:52,360
If I was you, I would think real hard before I said anything,

1112
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,900
because what you don't know could kill you.

1113
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,800
Now, where is it?

1114
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,340
All right. Just let me think about it, okay? Please.

1115
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,240
Why the fuck can't I think...

1116
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,870
Okay. All right. 303.

1117
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,110
- I remember the box. It's 303.  - See. Now where'd you take it to?

1118
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,780
- I delivered it.  - We was there all day! Wasn't we, Chi?

1119
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:18,820
Yeah, we were and you did not deliver it. Get your story...

1120
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:20,020
I'm telling the truth here!

1121
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:23,030
I even asked you if we got anything. Remember?

1122
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,960
- No, I don't remember all that.  - Oh! You don't remember all of that.

1123
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,560
Man, you're a bitch ass liar. Let me kill this motherfucker.

1124
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,030
I'll take you to it.

1125
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,900
- What did you say?  - I'll take you to it.

1126
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:34,960
You're damn straight...

1127
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,740
Look. You're gonna take me there, okay?

1128
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:47,180
But I swear to God on my mother's eyes if you're lying to me, I will leave you there.

1129
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:53,150
Damn, Brody was right.

1130
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,730
God sent us this shit.

1131
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:07,430
He knew we needed a way out, and he providing us with a way out.

1132
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:14,410
I will never rob another motherfucker again. I won't run up in nobody's banks.

1133
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,970
I ain't gonna run up in nobody's stores no more.

1134
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:19,620
I ain't gonna tap nobody and take their shit no more.

1135
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,350
- Hey, Guch.  - I'm done with that.

1136
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,850
They're here!

1137
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,020
Yeah, Shavoo, I forgot to ask you, man. How's your mom doing?

1138
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,420
My moms died last year, Bro.

1139
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,550
- Damn, ain't nobody told me nothing.  - Yeah. Yeah. But fuck all that.

1140
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:34,120
You didn't go and grow a brain on me last night, did you?

1141
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,530
What's that mean?

1142
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,660
No, I mean, this is the same shit I seen last night, right?

1143
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,040
What you think? I'm gonna switch the shit?

1144
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,040
I'm saying, it's been a long time since we... Since we hung out.

1145
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:50,200
Brothers will do anything for a dollar these days, Bro.

1146
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,380
I mean, my end is straight. What about yours?

1147
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:55,680
What about me?

1148
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:05,050
I ain't seen you in a long time either. You could be fucked up.

1149
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,600
When have I ever been known to be fucked up, Bro?

1150
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,180
Well, like you said, a brother would do anything for some money.

1151
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,670
Yeah. Just call your boy.

1152
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,780
Guch!

1153
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:32,050
I'm a drug dealer now.

1154
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,090
Come on, Bro, what's taking your man so long?

1155
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,060
Here he come, right here. Here he is.

1156
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,290
Let's get this party started.

1157
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,040
- What up, Shavoo?  - What up, Guch?

1158
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,890
What up, dawg. What's your name again?

1159
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:50,400
Guch, right? You're a funny cat.

1160
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,500
Uh-huh!

1161
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,410
I almost got you. So what's up? I'm glad you all made it, man.

1162
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,310
I was about to get on the phone and start making some calls.

1163
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,510
Stop bullshitting. You know I'm all you got.

1164
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:03,650
Shit. This shit will sell itself. All I got to do is make a few calls.

1165
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,420
Them calls will kill you.

1166
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,450
This ain't weed, Guch. This is coke. Brothers will kill for coke.

1167
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,260
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

1168
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,100
Well, these days I'm prepared for anything.

1169
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,900
What you say me and you stop fucking around before we both go elsewhere?

1170
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,740
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you talking.

1171
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,740
So, what's up? What's up, bro? You all got that money?

1172
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,840
- Right there. You got that shit?  - Hell, yeah, I got that shit.

1173
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,720
Just the way we laid it out for you last time. All laid out.

1174
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,380
Check that out, B.

1175
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,990
Yo, hold on, man! Yo, what you doing, man?

1176
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:43,550
- Relax.  - No, I ain't no relaxing!

1177
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:45,890
Ain't nobody checking nothing out. I'm checking the money out.

1178
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,660
This is becoming a tense situation.

1179
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,500
Yeah, you know what, Shavoo? I don't like surprises.

1180
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,440
What you all talking so loud for?

1181
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,210
Keep it down.

1182
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,250
Neither do I. I thought this motherfucker was dead.

1183
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,410
Surprises.

1184
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:13,820
That's what I'm talking about. I need to count that money.

1185
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,520
Let me check this out, man.

1186
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,330
Come on.

1187
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:29,670
Make sure you see the right one, and don't be looking at the numbers, either.

1188
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,210
Take us straight to the door you took it to.

1189
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,210
All right. Just give me a second. I'm trying to remember.

1190
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:36,710
Damn, man, it was just yesterday.

1191
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,910
I know, but I was high as hell yesterday, man.

1192
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,580
Don't give me that high shit. Just find it. Come on.

1193
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,190
- What you doing?  - Counting hundred stacks.

1194
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,330
Okay. That way, you can just stack shit all over the house,

1195
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,460
- so we know exactly what we have?  - Yeah.

1196
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:56,230
Man, you know you ain't never had to count no damn money before, man.

1197
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,030
Look, make 50 stacks of 20s, okay.

1198
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:02,470
After you get 10 of them, put it all together, that's $10,000.

1199
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,410
Please, do it the way I'm asking you how to do it, man.

1200
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,910
That way, we can get out of here sometime today.

1201
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,950
- All right?  - All right.

1202
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,810
- This is it, right here.  - You're a fucking liar. All right?

1203
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:21,880
Don't you try that shit, pothead. You know that shit ain't it.

1204
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,520
Matter of fact, I stuck my head out of here yesterday

1205
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,860
and asked you if we got anything. Remember?

1206
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:32,600
You're right. That's right. He's right.

1207
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,470
See, I told you. Now where did you take it to?

1208
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,370
All right. I came out that door over there,

1209
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,840
because the elevator sometimes works.

1210
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,940
- The elevator works?  - Yeah, man, sometimes.

1211
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,310
And I walked down this way.

1212
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:54,650
- This is it, right here.  - See, I told you!

1213
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:58,260
- I told you he didn't bring it here...  - Shut the fuck up.

1214
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:00,260
You want the whole block down here?

1215
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:02,420
- Would you shut up?  - You shut up. Don't tell me to...

1216
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,830
Shut up!

1217
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,040
Are you sure this is it?

1218
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:12,640
Yeah, I'm sure. I must have taken it to the wrong address.

1219
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:15,200
- Fucking dickhead.  - Stupid ass.

1220
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:19,510
You're right. You guys are absolutely right about me. I'm a dickhead.

1221
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:22,250
Okay. I can't believe I messed this up.

1222
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:23,950
Fuck.

1223
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,280
Well, you know what? I'm gonna get up on out...

1224
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,690
Where do you think you're going?

1225
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,920
What you talking about? I'm going back to work.

1226
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,930
Okay. You guys asked me to take you to where I took it,

1227
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,230
and this is where I took it. All right? This is it, right here.

1228
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,360
People are gonna be looking for me.

1229
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,600
There's gonna be a lot more people looking for you

1230
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:44,540
if you don't get my shit back.

1231
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:47,700
There ain't no way in hell I can get your shit back, man.

1232
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,680
What the hell do you want me to do?

1233
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,120
Who the fuck is that?

1234
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,820
- I don't know.  - What you mean?

1235
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,950
It's your house, motherfucker. What do you mean you don't know?

1236
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:10,200
I don't know. I ain't got no friends. How I know it ain't y'all's people?

1237
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,860
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1238
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:16,400
Hey, now, look. When we get the shit, y'all get the money.

1239
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,270
No, man. Look. Y'all motherfuckers better calm down.

1240
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,830
You got guns all over this...

1241
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,380
That ain't no mama-knock.

1242
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,540
Fuck this shit, Shav.

1243
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,310
- What the fuck is going on?  - Who the fuck's that at the door?

1244
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,320
Who is it?

1245
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,380
- It's that NDA guy.  - Well, don't answer it.

1246
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,260
He might have another box for us.

1247
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:37,890
Oh, shit!

1248
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,490
Box? Get that shit, B.

1249
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:45,060
Man, that was a grown-ass man knock. Fuck that shit.

1250
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,070
You see something? Can you see down there?

1251
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,940
Guch, what the fuck is going on up in here?

1252
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,310
All right, go ahead, open it.

1253
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,470
- What the fuck?  - Bro.

1254
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,940
Yo, what's up?

1255
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:03,110
Hey, how you doing? Yesterday, I dropped a box off here,

1256
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:06,560
and it's the wrong address.

1257
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:12,900
So if you'll just give me the box back, I'll take it to its rightful owner.

1258
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,660
- Give me a minute.  - Okay.

1259
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,460
- See, I told you.  - Shut up.

1260
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,900
- What'd he say?  - He said he wants the box back.

1261
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,600
Box?

1262
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,740
Tell him what we said. You know, tell him we took it back down to the station.

1263
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:29,750
It came here, and it came to the wrong address.

1264
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:31,180
Yo, Guch. What the fuck is going on?

1265
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,250
Hey. So do you have it?

1266
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,110
Well, we did have it.

1267
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,680
Mmm-hmm.

1268
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,990
- What the fuck is you doing?  - Shh! Shut the fuck up.

1269
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,220
You know what I mean, we took it back down to the station,

1270
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,360
- 'cause it had the wrong address on it.  - Oh! Okay.

1271
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,370
What, you think I'm fucking stupid?

1272
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,200
Fuck. Damn you.

1273
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:56,040
Get your ass in the house. You hear me?

1274
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:57,340
I don't know what the fuck is going on here.

1275
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,430
Go!

1276
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,100
Yeah, neither do I.

1277
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:05,140
- But I know one thing, that's my shit.  - Fuck you, that's my shit!

1278
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,680
It's in my house.

1279
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,410
Who you think you are? Who you think you are,

1280
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,420
coming to my crib, waving your guns around, talking shit?

1281
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,050
You see, that shit was coming to my crib!

1282
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,460
He fucked up and brought it to the wrong spot.

1283
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:18,930
No, I don't got nothing to do with this shit. Yo! Why don't we just put the guns down?

1284
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,330
Shut the fuck up!

1285
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,930
So what you thought, you was just gonna come in here and take some shit.

1286
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,910
- Is that what you thought?  - I ain't leaving without it.

1287
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,070
Yeah, we ain't leaving here without it.

1288
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:36,170
No? Y'all ain't gonna leave without it? Okay.

1289
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,940
Okay.

1290
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,010
Then take this with you.

1291
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,320
Get the fuck out of here!

1292
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:53,630
Guch!

1293
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,890
You want war, motherfucker?

1294
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,370
What? What?

1295
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,610
Damn.

1296
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,480
Fuck! That's my cousin, bitch!

1297
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,020

1299
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,530
- Go! Go!  - Hey, Shav!

1300
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:37,260
Fuck!

1301
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,850

Where are you crawling to, you fucking cockroach?

1303
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,410
This is for Bodega.

1304
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,910
Always remember what you're doing it for.

1305
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,480
If it ain't worth dying for, you don't wanna be in it.

1306
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,700
God, if this is your way to tell me to stop smoking weed, I hear you.

1307
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:00,440
I hear you.

01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:51,460
You don't want this.

1312
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:55,060
I'm telling you right now, you don't want this.

1313
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:58,260
