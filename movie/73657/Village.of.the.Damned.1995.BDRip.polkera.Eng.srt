1
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:45,416
- Honey... do you hear that?
- Hear what?

2
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,553
Hey, Barbara?

3
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:07,897
Did you hear that?
I could have sworn I heard whispering.

4
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,609
You're reading my mind, that's all.

5
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,445
My thoughts sound like whispers.

6
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,866
Oh, yeah?
What were you thinking?

7
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,076
I love you, Doc.

8
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:24,706
You sure make it fun to wake up
before dawn, I'll tell you that.

9
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,203
Frank?

10
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,831
Hey, Frank?

11
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,345
Hey, Frank.

12
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:06,099
- Did you finish last night?
- No.

13
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,936
Honey, it's a quarter to 6:00.

14
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,813
It's important.

15
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:14,190
Okay. Okay.

16
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,486
Thanks.

17
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,333
Okay.

18
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,585
That's everything.

19
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,755
Helium for the balloons!

20
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:41,426
I'm picking up a tank at Harold's
right after I drop you off...

21
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,219
per your instructions.

22
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:46,514
Did I think Of that? Cool.

23
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,726
I must be starting to get
this delegating authority stuff.

24
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:54,105
Well, Mrs. Magoo, I guess
that's why they made you principal.

25
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,774
I guess so.

26
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,986
Honey, don't smoke.

27
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,779
Hey, come on! Come on!
You're gonna make me crash.

28
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:06,743
Look, I'll quit smoking when
you decide to get pregnant, all right?

29
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,504
HEY, guys!

30
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,637
- Hi!
- Hi.

31
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,979
- Be very careful.
- Here I come.

32
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,106
Watch your step.

33
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,364
You all right?

34
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,367
Hey, Jill!

35
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,995
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

36
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,956
- Who's the chef?
- Oliver.

37
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,959
Oh, great, I love burnt hot dogs.

38
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:59,420
Thanks.
So, when's Ben coming home?

39
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,216
Six weeks, four days, and nine hours.

40
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,969
Okay, now watch the edges.

41
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,554
- Don't spill it.
- I got it.

42
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,598
Let's take it over here.

43
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:13,559
- Hey, Callie, how are you?
- Frank. Good. Good to see you.

44
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,812
Hey, where's my helium?

45
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:19,190
- Say you love me, baby.
- Not until you get me my helium.

46
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:22,277
Righty-O.
I'll get right on it, dear.

47
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,614
<i>-Oh You go here.
- Okay.</i>

48
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,617
There's Jill.
I've got those receipts here.

49
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:33,329
<i>- Hey, how you doing?
- How the hell are you?</i>

50
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,999
- All right, bye.
- Bye. See you later.

51
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,763
- Barbara!
- Hey, Frank!

52
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,225
Good morning, Sam.

53
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:58,020
And you must be Cindy.
It's nice to finally meet you.

54
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,108
So, go in and take a look around?

55
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,194
Yeah, you're both gonna
love this place.

56
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,838
- Harold.
- Morning, Doc.

57
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,340
- Frank.
- Hey, Doc, how the hell are you?

58
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,718
Heading over to the school fair?

59
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:31,721
Nah, I gotta go to Butler County today
and make my rounds at the hospital.

60
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,390
Come on, you've got to try out
this muscle machine I made.

61
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,683
Show everybody how strong you are.

62
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:37,435
I don't know.

63
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:40,188
I should probably just sit down in the
shade and watch you young guys do it.

64
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,694
<i>- See you, tough guy.
- Right.</i>

65
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,077
Okay. Thanks, Jill.

66
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,913
We need finger paints.

67
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,332
Okay. I'll get them.

68
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,168
Just put it on the table.

69
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,351
Finger paints. Okay.

70
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,444
Yikes.

71
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,283
Whoa!

72
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:13,591
Well, civilian pilot
spots the smoke.

73
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:17,970
And then I get here and find two
of my officers passed out like babies.

74
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,223
And everything on that side
of the white line is out cold.

75
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,685
So somebody starts talking
about chemical weapons...

76
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,814
and somebody hits a panic button,
and then you people are calling.

77
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:32,568
<i>- There you go.
- Look, there is no research lab.</i>

78
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,612
There is no chemical plant.

79
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,658
There is no toxic waste dump.
There is no nuclear plant.

80
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,994
- There's no nothing around here.
- Okay.

81
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,705
Nothing on the news channels.

82
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,999
Nothing on the news services.
Nobody's got it yet.

83
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,876
Good.

84
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:53,839
I'm just gonna take myself in there and
get a look-see.

85
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,809
- Ed.
- Hey.

86
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,978
- That's Frank McGowan's truck, right?
- What's left of it.

87
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,482
- Lucky you wasn't in town today, Doc.
- What's going on here?

88
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,694
Nobody knows nothin', not even
that fed doctor down there.

89
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:18,823
She brought this whole circus
with her, and they ain't got a clue.

90
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:36,215
Now, go on out there and see
what the hell's going on. Be careful.

91
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,843
- Stay here?
- Yeah, we're just waiting.

92
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,177
All right, good.

93
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:01,490
Hey!

94
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,118
Pull him back!
Get him out of there! Let's go!

95
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:05,661
Come on! Come on!

96
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,748
Get him down!

97
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,875
- Stay back boys!
- Excuse me.

98
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,502
Hits 'em like a hammer, Doc.
That's all we know.

99
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,422
<i>- Some kind of chemical? Gas?
- No, it can't be.</i>

100
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:19,592
The edges of the affected area
are well-defined.

101
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,302
Stationary.

102
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:26,432
- Doc, this is Dr. Susan...
- Verner. Like Turner, with a "V."

103
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,769
Epidemiologist,
National Science Foundation.

104
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:30,770
Alan Chaffee.

105
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,854
- MD?
- Yeah.

106
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:35,441
He's breathing. Good pulse.
I think he just fainted.

107
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,776
Is Midwich affected by this?

108
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:40,196
- My hunch would be, yes.
- My wife's in Midwich.

109
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,323
We're trying to get through
for the last six hours, Doc.

110
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,991
Nobody picks up the phone,
nobody calls out.

111
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:47,411
Could somebody please get me
some blood and urine samples?

112
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,666
- What's the call?
- 98.

113
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,795
You going?
Okay, all right.

114
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,298
Just take it easy.
Bring him a blanket.

115
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,612
- You okay?
- Yeah.

116
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,232
What happened?

117
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,135
You okay?

118
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,840
Barbara? Barbara?

119
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,177
Thank God.
Are you all right?

120
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,931
Sweetheart, are you okay?

121
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:16,477
- I'm cold.
- All right, come on. Let's go home.

122
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:05,234
Oh, no. Oh, no.

123
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,902
Oh, no.

124
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,612
<i>Heavenly Father...</i>

125
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,408
we mourn these lives cut short...

126
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:16,412
without warning or apparent purpose.

127
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:20,499
We search for a reason and find none.

128
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,295
We have become accustomed
to the power of science...

129
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:29,550
so when we were struck down, we
turned to science and asked, "Why?"

130
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,845
But it could not answer.

131
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,639
So now we turn our eyes
toward Heaven...

132
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:39,852
and seek our comfort
in God's infinite mercy.

133
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,105
Let us pray.

134
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,650
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

135
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,652
...hallowed be Thy name...

136
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,572
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be clone,

137
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,991
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

138
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:56,994
Give us this day our daily bread,

139
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,496
and forgive us our trespasses,

140
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,666
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

141
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:07,296
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

142
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,257
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power,

143
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,260
and the glory, forever and ever.

144
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,470
Amen.

145
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,640
- Did you ever hear of Charles Fort?
- Huh-uh.

146
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,433
<i>He wrote The Book of the Damned,</i>

147
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,310
about things that nobody's
been able to explain.

148
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,606
Like frogs falling from the sky,
blue snow, red rain...

149
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,691
Are you suggesting I read him?

150
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,568
No. No. It's just that...

151
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,572
Sometimes mysteries don't get solved.

152
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,575
I mean, look, what if something
like this happens again?

153
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,161
I don't know. What do I do?
Can I call you?

154
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,039
Well, of course, you can call me.

155
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,085
Oh, and by the way, I suggest
you read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

156
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,337
Sherlock Holmes once said,

157
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,131
"When you've eliminated
the impossible,

158
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:34,842
whatever remains,
however improbable,

159
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,136
must be the truth."

160
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,327
It's not possible.

161
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,956
You made a mistake.
Do it again.

162
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,127
Well, I mean, I don't have a problem
running the tests again, Callie.

163
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,588
I have felt like this before
in the morning.

164
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,840
It is just some kind of bug.

165
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,525
Melanie?

166
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,707
Melanie?

167
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,542
What's the matter?

168
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,885
- Maybe I can help.
- No. You can't.

169
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,808
- There they are!
- Hey, you guys!

170
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,478
We're empty!
We need some more here!

171
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,064
Hi, how are you?

172
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,398
It's good to see you.

173
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,775
Hi.

174
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,152
Wow!

175
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,321
Wow!

176
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,451
Hey, Ben, this is fantastic.

177
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,964
Callie, look up and smile.

178
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,265
So, Ben, after a year in Japan,

179
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,768
did you ever think you'd have
to get used to being a dad?

180
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,572
She's pregnant again.

181
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,747
Hello, Doc.

182
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,960
I said, "Hello."

183
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,547
How long have you been
standing there?

184
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:21,216
- Oh, ages.
- Liar.

185
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,221
Big boy.

186
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,143
Hey.

187
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,687
Why are you kissing me like that?

188
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,318
I wanted to know first,
so I used a home pregnancy kit.

189
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,321
Yeah, well, honey, you know,
those are unreliable.

190
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:46,241
And that's why I went to see
Dr. Cornright just to make sure.

191
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,577
Gonna open it?

192
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,628
Alan?

193
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,723
Hi. You got a minute?

194
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,767
Sure.

195
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:26,281
Well, everything's positive.

196
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,242
You are pregnant.

197
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,167
We'd been trying, you know.

198
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,003
Look. Umm...

199
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:43,340
I wanted to tell you something before
you hear it from somebody else.

200
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,760
There's a lot of pregnancies.

201
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,012
I mean, a lot.

202
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:53,558
Much more than would
normally be expected.

203
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,520
What do you mean?

204
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,148
Well, umm...

205
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,818
Is something wrong with my baby?

206
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,946
No, no, no, no,
it's nothing to indicate that.

207
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,656
I mean, you're a normal,
healthy young woman...

208
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,200
Alan, don't talk to me like a doctor.

209
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,537
Okay.

210
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:18,875
All the pregnancies seem to date
from the clay of the blackout.

211
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,419
Oh, no!

212
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,391
Dr. Susan Verner
has flown in...

213
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,144
This is all because
of that blackout, ain't it?

214
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,772
Why don't you just come out
and say something!

215
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,315
They don't know that for sure.

216
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,651
They are all gonna be deformed!

217
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,361
For everyone's sake...

218
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,906
Wait a minute.
That's not true.

219
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,493
Excuse me! That's not true.
There's no reason to believe that.

220
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,496
Barbara and I are pregnant. Okay?
We know how you feel.

221
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,791
We know what a lot of you are
thinking, so let me say right now

222
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,335
the same thing I've told
a lot of you individually.

223
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,338
The standard tests have not
revealed one abnormality.

224
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:08,216
Anywhere. Not one. All right?

225
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:11,428
Let's listen... Just a minute.
Let's listen to Dr. Verner, please.

226
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,512
She's come to talk to us.

227
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,724
Dr. Susan Verner,
ladies and gentlemen.

228
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,144
I wanna start off by saying

229
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:22,105
that we are all very concerned
about your well-being.

230
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,441
- Sure.
- Yeah.

231
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,611
But ultimately it will come down
to individual decisions.

232
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:32,491
And I understand that these decisions
will be probably the most intimate,

233
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:37,245
personal, difficult decisions
that you ever make in your life.

234
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,706
However, because your pregnancies

235
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,375
have attracted intense
scientific interest,

236
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,711
including
the National Institutes of Health

237
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,213
and National Science Foundation,

238
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:50,008
those of you who decide
to have your child

239
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,427
will have all prenatal expenses paid.

240
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:56,598
You'll also receive $3,000 monthly
as an allowance.

241
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:01,728
If you allow your child to be examined

242
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,189
and tested
on some sort of regular basis.

243
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,526
Is that $3,000 a family?

244
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,903
What if your wife and your daughter
both have kids?

245
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,739
Then, you would receive $6,000.

246
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,618
$6,000?

247
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,417
Look, I don't want you to interpret this
allowance as some sort of a pressure.

248
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,586
It isn't. It's your decision.

249
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,506
And if you decide to terminate,

250
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,551
then, of course,
you have the right to do that.

251
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,344
And you can do it privately.

252
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:38,098
Or if financially unable, a medical
team will be brought in next week.

253
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,935
<i>- The choice is yours.
- That's killing babies.</i>

254
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,774
Callie?

255
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,152
Are you okay?

256
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,364
Ben's moving out.

257
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:55,824
Oh, Callie.

258
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,660
He won't believe me.

259
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,914
What are you gonna do?

260
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,293
I can't keep it.

261
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,504
I mean, it can't be Ben's.

262
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,424
I just don't...

263
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,385
I just don't understand.

264
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,849
Something very strange
is happening to all of us, Callie.

265
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,811
You know, they say...

266
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,356
the Roberts' girl is a virgin.

267
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:33,194
What are you going to do?

268
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,031
I don't know.

269
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,535
I don't know.

270
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,593
- You all right?
- Yeah.

271
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,845
Yeah.

272
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,598
It was just a dream.

273
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,810
Okay.

274
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,981
Can we just go back to sleep, huh?

275
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,619
What's going on, doctor?

276
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,788
Nothing.

277
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,209
They have apparently decided
to keep their babies.

278
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,337
All of them? Why?

279
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,258
That's a very good question.

280
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,330
<i>- No!
- Nurse!</i>

281
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,040
No!

282
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,628
Keep pushing! Push!

283
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,380
Okay, here we go. Here we go.
Almost.

284
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,300
Almost done! Good, Mom.
That's good.

285
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,636
Push, push, push.

286
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,101
That's it. That's it.

287
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,815
You're doing great.
Take a deep breath.

288
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,858
Deep breath and push.

289
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,693
- Push, push, push.
- Push, push, push.

290
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:04,280
Come with that. Come with that.
Push a little more.

291
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,575
- Push, Barbara, push. Deep breath.
- A little more. A little more.

292
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:10,995
Push, Sarah. Push. Push.

293
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,918
Help me! Help me!
Help me! Help me!

294
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,504
We've got a problem!

295
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,383
ICU, now!

296
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,813
- Push, push, push!
- Come on! Come on! Come!

297
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,857
<i>- Yes! There we go!
- Good, Barbara!</i>

298
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,316
And there we go.

299
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,527
Oh, beauty!
Looking great, sweetie.

300
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,112
Good job.

301
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:47,365
It's a girl. It's a girl, honey.

302
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:48,157
It's a girl?

303
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,117
Push!

304
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:54,205
Yes, there we are.
Clamp this.

305
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:56,374
Look, here's your baby.
Here's your baby.

306
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:05,383
- Oh, my baby! Oh, my...
- He's beautiful.

307
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,190
Ben.

308
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,656
Come on, just breathe once.
Oxygen. Oxygen.

309
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,867
Watch the BP.

310
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,911
Come on, sweetie.
You can do it.

311
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:33,953
Push.

312
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,205
Doctor, do you think you could get
your ass over here and help me!

313
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,707
<i>- Yes, Dr. Verner.
- Push!</i>

314
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,959
Bear down on her! Push!

315
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,920
All right, here we come!
Here we go!

316
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,672
Come on, now, push!
Give me one big push!

317
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:48,468
Come on, here we go!
Here we go! Come on!

318
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:53,056
I'm sorry. It's stillborn.

319
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,855
- Get some fluid in her.
- Yes, Dr. Verner.

320
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,352
Hey! How we doing?
Everything all right?

321
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,896
We lost the Roberts' baby.

322
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:46,651
- God. How?
- Respiratory failure.

323
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,987
Umbilical asphyxia.

324
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:18,933
Where did you take the baby?
I saw you take Melanie's baby outside.

325
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:23,855
Yes, took the baby for an autopsy.
I didn't want the other mothers to see.

326
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,513
I baptize thee

327
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,099
in the name of the Father

328
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:05,521
and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

329
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,443
I 90f you.

330
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:12,987
Yes.

331
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,410
Let us pray.

332
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:24,499
Heavenly Father, we thank You
that by the water of the Holy Spirit,

333
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:28,044
You have bestowed upon these
your servants, the forgiveness of sin

334
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,922
and have raised them
to the new life of grace.

335
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:33,925
Sustain them, O Lord,
in Your Holy Spirit.

336
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:36,928
Give them an inquiring
and discerning heart,

337
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:39,806
the courage to will
and to persevere,

338
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:42,475
the spirit to know
and to love You,

339
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:46,312
and the gift of wonder and joy
in all your work. Amen.

340
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:47,855
Amen.

341
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:02,245
Here you go.

342
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,874
Good girl.

343
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,210
That's a good girl.

344
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:14,465
Note how the section of hair is flat
on one side, then arced on the other.

345
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,218
- Like a capital "D".
- Right.

346
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:21,848
The texture is... I don't know.
It's unusually soft.

347
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,561
What did you think
when you looked at her nails?

348
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:29,147
Narrower than normal.

349
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,150
Any results yet from the DNA testing?

350
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,110
Common genetic characteristics.

351
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:37,989
Almost as if they are siblings
from the same parent.

352
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:42,910
But... It's way too early
to have anything conclusive.

353
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,957
Hey, baby.

354
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,084
What ya doing?

355
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,512
David?

356
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,934
You can spell your name.

357
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,690
How can you spell your name?

358
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:14,692
Huh?

359
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:20,990
How can Mommy's...
smart little boy spell his name?

360
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,080
[ Baby huffs 1

361
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,462
Sweetie, was the soup too hot?

362
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,227
Okay, baby.

363
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:53,356
We're gonna go see
our friend Mara. Yeah.

364
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,261
Okay.

[ Child babbling 1

366
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,199
Barbara?

367
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,301
Are you crazy?

368
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,224
Oh, God!

369
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,769
Barbara?

370
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:17,523
Honey, can't you tell me
what happened?

371
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,421
Barbara?

372
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,176
Barbara!

373
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:11,804
Barbara!

374
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,431
Don't!

375
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:16,350
No! God, no!

376
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,269
No! Barbara!

377
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,946
I understand there are some
recent developments at Midwich.

378
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,657
Yes.

379
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:35,536
The children are beginning to interact
more with the general community.

380
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:39,540
There've been a few casualties...
I should say accidents, suicides...

381
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:42,460
that might be related
to contact with the children.

382
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,421
But no direct physical violence
was involved.

383
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:48,257
I have also been trying
unsuccessfully to get Dr. Chaffee

384
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,468
to come back on the program.

385
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:51,844
His daughter's the leader,
isn't she?

386
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,430
He's probably got his hands full.

387
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,850
Personal considerations
aren't important, are they?

388
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,853
I think that the opportunity
to study these children

389
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:04,064
should take precedent...
over any considerations.

390
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,735
Let's cut to the chase here.

391
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:10,863
It is now of interest to national
security that we continue

392
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,492
to carefully monitor
their developing powers.

393
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,705
I ask for another year's grant.

394
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:35,531
Good afternoon, children.

395
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:41,954
Mara, why do you smile?

396
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:44,498
You're trying to hide
your thoughts from us.

397
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,166
Oh!

398
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:48,919
Well, just how deeply do you see?

399
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:52,214
Everything active in your mind.

400
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:55,884
But the process that leads
to the spoken words eludes us.

401
00:43:56,468 --> 00:44:00,222
Why do you speak some thoughts
and not others?

402
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:04,852
Wouldn't it be a noisy world
if we said everything we thought?

403
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,991
Okay, I'm going to put a drop of this
in your eyes; it won't hurt.

404
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,490
I'm sorry. Calm down.

405
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,200
I'm gonna wash your eye out.

406
00:45:02,368 --> 00:45:05,412
Okay, open your eyes!
It's all right!

407
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:09,625
It's okay! It's okay!

408
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,948
How's the doctor?

409
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:25,492
Corneal scarring.

410
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:27,661
Most likely, permanent blindness.

411
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:29,580
How did it happen?

412
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,749
Doesn't remember much.

413
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:34,710
It will be listed as an accident.

414
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,213
It was the children.

415
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,883
There's no proof of that.

416
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:46,680
What I wanna know is...
are the people in this town safe?

417
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:49,141
What are they gonna do to us?

418
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:50,601
Alan.

419
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:53,604
<i>- Hi.
- This has got to stop.</i>

420
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:56,273
They don't belong in regular classes.

421
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,360
It's getting dangerous.
The other children can't learn.

422
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,529
I was thinking
maybe you could teach them.

423
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:04,907
They seem to respect you.

424
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,366
Respect?

425
00:47:06,617 --> 00:47:08,994
No. They don't even know
the meaning of that word.

426
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:12,706
Why bother? It doesn't make
any difference what we do.

427
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,502
Alan, we need you.

428
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:19,713
What am I gonna teach them?

429
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:22,800
What am I possibly
going to teach them?

430
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:25,511
Humanity.

431
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,644
Humanity.

432
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:45,739
Hello, sweetheart.

433
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,669
Come on.

434
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:30,325
There's no need for you
to become emotional.

435
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:34,788
I'm old enough to do things by myself.

436
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,675
Hey, David.

437
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,182
You wanna talk about
what happened at the clinic today?

438
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:59,313
Why should I be experiencing
emotion at this moment?

439
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:03,901
What is that word you're thinking?

440
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,321
What is "empathy"?

441
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:14,912
So if I have felt pain,

442
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,208
I should be able to identify
with others who feel pain.

443
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:22,628
Yeah.

444
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:24,755
Yes.

445
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:37,851
Good night, David.

446
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:49,756
What's the matter?

447
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:54,928
You want some?

448
00:50:57,431 --> 00:50:59,516
I'm sorry.

449
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:03,937
I just can't hack it.

450
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:47,314
<i>God said,</i>

451
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:54,529
<i>"Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness."</i>

452
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:58,825
<i>But "image" does not mean
outer image,</i>

453
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:03,997
<i>or every statue
or photograph would be man.</i>

454
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:07,459
<i>It means the inner image.</i>

455
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:11,880
<i>The spirit, the soul.</i>

456
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:19,054
So we gather here today
to remember the inner beauty

457
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:22,099
of one who lost her hold.

458
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:23,934
Melanie Roberts

459
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:28,313
somehow lost that image
of herself as a creature

460
00:52:28,647 --> 00:52:32,275
made in God's bountiful spirit.

461
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:40,075
But what of those in our midst
who do not have individual souls

462
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:43,662
or spirits?

463
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:48,792
They have one mind
that they share between them.

464
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:51,503
One spirit.

465
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,382
And they have the look of man.

466
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:59,427
But not the nature of mankind.

467
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:04,099
David?

468
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:07,310
What are you doing here?

469
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,105
Looking for the baby.

470
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:16,361
The one who was born with us.

471
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:19,156
The one who died.

472
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,034
How do you know about that?

473
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:28,874
The baby's not here.
She was taken away.

474
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:30,458
Where?

475
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:32,961
I don't know.

476
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:41,136
Do you have a memory of the baby?

477
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,932
But it bothers you.

478
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:51,104
It hurts.
It hurts to lose a loved one.

479
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:54,774
She was to be with me.

480
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:58,486
We were to be together.

481
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:03,491
How do you know that?

482
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:22,969
You've lost someone, too.

483
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,017
I think I can teach them.

484
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:13,228
Anyway, I'll try.

485
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:17,774
I never told David
about the Roberts' baby.

486
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:22,028
Right.

487
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:25,115
And then he said,
"She was to be with me."

488
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:27,075
What did that mean?

489
00:55:27,951 --> 00:55:29,911
I don't know.

490
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:38,295
Are they paired up?

491
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:39,671
Like a mate?

492
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:07,699
Well, what can I teach
such bright young students?

493
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:10,910
What about human physiology?

494
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:14,331
That's at least something
that I know a little bit about.

495
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:17,375
For example, does anybody here
know how the eye works?

496
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:20,170
Do you mean how do we see, or...

497
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,047
Well, what else can the eye do?

498
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:26,343
- The eyes are...
- The eyes are the windows of the soul.

499
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,094
Yes.

500
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:31,306
That's right, Mara. I see
that you've been reading proverbs.

501
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:33,558
I was speaking to Robert.

502
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:38,104
The eyes are the windows of the soul.

503
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:46,321
Right.

504
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,366
All right, if you'd rather talk

505
00:56:49,366 --> 00:56:52,118
about philosophy
instead of physiology,

506
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:54,287
let's talk about the soul.

507
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:55,372
<i>Alan.</i>

508
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:56,122
<i>Sorry.</i>

509
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:58,625
<i>Can you come to my office
for a minute, please?</i>

510
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:02,629
Umm, yes.
I'll be right there.

511
00:57:02,796 --> 00:57:04,798
All right, children,
while I'm away for just a moment,

512
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,594
why don't you each take out
a volume of the encyclopedia...

513
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:20,105
...and try to learn a little something
about our culture.

514
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:42,293
I know your game.

515
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,421
I know what you're up to.

516
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:48,216
Ever since you got here,
I've been watching.

517
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:54,222
Watching people leave this town,
watching things die.

518
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:56,724
You ain't right. None of ya.

519
00:57:56,724 --> 00:58:00,353
One of these days, somebody's
gonna do something about it.

520
00:58:03,815 --> 00:58:06,818
I don't like the way
you're looking at me, boy.

521
00:58:11,114 --> 00:58:14,242
I got a gun, too,
and I ain't the only one.

522
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:18,079
One day somebody's gonna
get up on a rooftop,

523
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,417
and they're gonna start picking you
little bastards off.

524
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:25,962
One by one by one.

525
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:41,144
Well?
Ain't you gonna do something?

526
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:45,690
Ain't you gonna bawl
like all the other little pissants?

527
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,775
Well, do something, damn it!

528
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:01,558
God.

529
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:52,066
There are going to be changes.

530
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:02,994
God.

531
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:06,623
God, help us.

532
01:01:06,956 --> 01:01:08,291
The children did it.

533
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,668
I know they did it.

534
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:12,754
And my daughter was involved.

535
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:15,256
Now, who are they?

536
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:18,259
I'd originally thought they were
some form of mutation.

537
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:21,387
Some abrupt evolutionary jump.

538
01:01:21,763 --> 01:01:23,973
It was their communal consciousness.

539
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:27,560
But I couldn't explain the blackout.

540
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,188
Or the mass pregnancies.

541
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:33,566
Midwich isn't the only colony
of such children.

542
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:39,989
In a township in northern Australia,
30 infants were born in a single day.

543
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:43,368
They all died
within ten hours of birth.

544
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:45,036
In an Inuit community
outside of Anchorage,

545
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:46,871
a group of 10 children were born.

546
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:52,418
Or 20 births in a small village
near the Turkish-Iranian border.

547
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:54,754
Each location was remote,

548
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:58,633
isolated, and each had
a blackout, the same as Midwich.

549
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,635
And how long have you known
about this?

550
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,221
The way I see it,
there's three possibilities.

551
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:05,473
Number one: parthenogenesis.

552
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:08,810
The development
of a fetus without fertilization.

553
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:10,645
I know. I don't buy that, either.

554
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:14,315
Number two: we do know the CIA
slipped large closes of LSD

555
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:15,900
to men without them knowing it,

556
01:02:16,067 --> 01:02:19,362
in order to study the effects
of psychotropes on gene structure.

557
01:02:19,529 --> 01:02:21,823
So, maybe the government
engineered the blackout,

558
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,951
and then they artificially inseminated
your women with super-sperm.

559
01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:28,538
First, they knocked them out,
then they knocked them up.

560
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:32,792
And what's the third possibility?

561
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:36,421
Xenogenesis. Implantation.

562
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:40,174
The production of an offspring
unlike that of the parent.

563
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,428
Or should I say "host"?

564
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:24,927
Come back to the project, Alan.

565
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,805
Not just a matter
of protecting your daughter.

566
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:32,018
As you can see, it goes...
far, far beyond that.

567
01:03:35,146 --> 01:03:37,523
You have to put this
in the back of your mind.

568
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:39,442
Don't even think about it
when you're around the children.

569
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:41,486
Don't ever let them know
that you know.

570
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:42,737
Why didn't you tell us?

571
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:46,365
- I mean, why didn't you warn us?
- Because I couldn't.

572
01:03:46,574 --> 01:03:48,409
Well, I couldn't, Alan.

573
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:51,204
If anybody else knew,
the children would know.

574
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:54,665
Look, I have spent years
of my life building a wall around this.

575
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:58,085
Hiding it, so they couldn't read
what was in my mind.

576
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:59,837
But as their powers grow stronger,

577
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,881
they just keep looking
deeper and deeper.

578
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:04,967
I need your help.
Alan, would you please just...?

579
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:08,304
Come back to the project.

580
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:04,944
We've made our decision.
Discussion will not change our plans.

581
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:11,075
We will live in the abandoned barn
outside of town.

582
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:14,453
You'll bring us supplies.

583
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,914
You can't stop us, you know.

584
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:19,667
Don't try.

585
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,051
You've been discussing us
with Dr. Verner.

586
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,597
What did she tell you?

587
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:38,519
You're hiding something.

588
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:38,537
I'm not letting you go.

589
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:45,044
- You haven't been given an option.
- Have you?

590
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:53,302
You know, you don't always
have to do everything they tell you.

591
01:06:54,387 --> 01:06:58,891
- We are the same.
- No. You're not.

592
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:01,143
You're David.
You're different.

593
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:37,013
I've come to get Julie.
You seen her?

594
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:43,019
Is she at the barn?

595
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:46,689
Fine.

596
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:12,673
Are you all right?

597
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:13,632
I'm sorry.

598
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:16,010
You're okay, aren't you?

599
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,387
Julie doesn't want
to come with you.

600
01:08:19,055 --> 01:08:21,307
Well, damn it,
I don't care what Julie wants.

601
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:24,435
Her mother's frantic.
I'm bringing her home.

602
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:32,419
Some kind of big accident, Doc,
out by the barn.

603
01:09:33,546 --> 01:09:35,047
Alan, wait!

604
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:39,135
Alan, I was just informed that
the other towns with blackout children

605
01:09:39,135 --> 01:09:40,094
have been destroyed.

606
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:41,345
What? All of them?

607
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:43,889
And everyone in them,
the adults and the children.

608
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:44,974
They couldn't evacuate

609
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:46,767
without the children knowing
what was happening.

610
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:50,187
- The governments gave no warning.
- God. What about Midwich?

611
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:52,189
I've been told to pack and get out.

612
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:56,527
I'm leaving tonight, Alan.
Do the same. Get out while you can.

613
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,206
Another man is dead.

614
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:17,047
Why do you hate us so much, Mara?

615
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:21,802
<i>It isn't a matter of hate.
It is a biological obligation.</i>

616
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:25,639
You are thinking
of what happened to the others.

617
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:28,184
Then, our actions
shouldn't surprise you.

618
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,604
<i>We have to survive
no matter what the cost.</i>

619
01:10:31,604 --> 01:10:32,980
We are the only ones left now.

620
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:35,482
I don't see why we can't reach
an understanding.

621
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:37,151
Then, why can't we just live together?

622
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:42,114
If we coexist, we shall dominate you.
That is inevitable.

623
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:44,450
Eventually, you will try
to eliminate us.

624
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:46,994
We are all creatures
of the life-force.

625
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:50,456
Now it has set us at one another
to see who will survive.

626
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,085
<i>- That's a cruel sport.
- Life is cruelty.</i>

627
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:59,548
We all feed on each other, exploit
each other in some way to survive.

628
01:11:01,175 --> 01:11:03,135
I don't agree with you.

629
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:06,013
I think that adaptation
is the key to survival.

630
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:09,308
Cooperation and symbiosis...

631
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,060
and compassion.

632
01:11:12,186 --> 01:11:16,232
Why do you think your own survival
depends upon emotion from us?

633
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:18,025
Should we pity you?

634
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:21,862
- Empathize with your plight?
- You should feel!

635
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:24,573
You should feel something!

636
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:28,077
Without feelings, you're nothing.

637
01:11:28,077 --> 01:11:30,704
You're just second-rate mimics
of a higher organism.

638
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,123
That's right, a higher organism.

639
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:35,834
We're your superiors
in our capacity to love.

640
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:38,879
Without compassion,
you're a doomed species.

641
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:42,549
Emotion is irrelevant.
It is not our nature.

642
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:51,725
Well, I'm not so sure
you're right about that, Mara.

643
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:54,228
Still, you are aware
of the other colonies.

644
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:57,648
So you must be,
in some basic sense,

645
01:11:57,648 --> 01:12:02,152
aware of who...
what we are.

646
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:04,905
Yes.

647
01:12:05,197 --> 01:12:09,994
So the question becomes,
should you be allowed to live?

648
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,628
You're suddenly thinking of an ocean.

649
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:27,553
You're blocking your thoughts
rather effectively with this image.

650
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:34,018
We must leave here,
spread out, disperse.

651
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:38,188
Soon we will have reached a stage
where we can form new colonies.

652
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:41,775
You will arrange a method
of getting us away from here.

653
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:44,236
What if I refuse you?

654
01:12:44,486 --> 01:12:49,867
You are a prisoner of your values,
and you won't be able to deceive us.

655
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:54,163
You know that. Don't you?

656
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,958
Father?

657
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:02,171
Yes. Yes.

658
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:04,048
Yes, I know that, Mara.

659
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:09,011
Make your arrangements.
We must leave tonight.

660
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:38,290
You're thinking of the one who died.

661
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,251
She was to be my partner.

662
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:45,464
Yes, it's true.

663
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:49,343
Without a mate,
you are of less importance to us.

664
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:53,263
And your development
of emotions is disturbing.

665
01:13:55,641 --> 01:14:02,356
We can't leave you behind, David.
It is time we resolved this.

666
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,314
Hurry UP!

667
01:14:44,565 --> 01:14:48,527
Begone, everyone who is proud,
and bring him low...

668
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:51,697
...and tread down the wicked
where they stand!

669
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:54,491
- This is the last of it.
- All right, get going.

670
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:57,369
Bind their faces
in the world below!

671
01:14:57,578 --> 01:14:59,913
Then will I also
acknowledge to you

672
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,501
that your own right hand
can give you victory!

673
01:15:18,015 --> 01:15:20,934
I'm glad you're here, I...

674
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:24,229
I wanted to talk to you.
I really think that I can help you.

675
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,756
You've got to stop! Please, stop!

676
01:15:50,923 --> 01:15:53,884
You got to stop! Sarah, please!

677
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:28,210
Hast thou eyes of flesh?

678
01:16:28,752 --> 01:16:31,838
Dost thou see as man sees?

679
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:09,663
<i>A state of emergency
has been declared.</i>

680
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:15,293
<i>Please return to your homes
and remain there until further notice.</i>

681
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,548
Let's just go!

682
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:22,592
Come here!
Grab my hand, quick!

683
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:23,593
Come on!

684
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:28,974
<i>Clear the streets.
Unauthorized people will be arrested.</i>

685
01:19:31,685 --> 01:19:34,354
<i>This is a state of emergency.</i>

686
01:20:10,015 --> 01:20:11,683
Oh, please be home.

687
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:17,105
Alan.

688
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:19,107
The children murdered Sarah.

689
01:20:19,107 --> 01:20:22,235
Susan Verner, too.
I just found her at the clinic.

690
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:25,071
The state police
are on their way out to the barn.

691
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:27,032
They're going after the children.
We've got to stop them.

692
01:20:27,032 --> 01:20:28,116
No, no, no, we can't go out there.

693
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:30,202
You can't go out there.
You'll just get hurt.

694
01:20:30,202 --> 01:20:31,077
We've got to try!

695
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:33,663
No. Jill, the state police can't do
anything to stop the children.

696
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:34,915
It'll be a bloodbath.

697
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:36,249
Now, Jill. Jill.

698
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:38,627
Now, listen to me.
Listen to me.

699
01:20:38,627 --> 01:20:40,504
There's another way.

700
01:20:40,504 --> 01:20:42,589
Now, look, something happened today.

701
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:45,300
I was able to block Mara
from reading my thoughts.

702
01:20:45,509 --> 01:20:49,554
- How?
- I suddenly thought of the ocean.

703
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:51,765
I suddenly saw the view
in front of our house.

704
01:20:51,932 --> 01:20:55,560
You know how Barbara and I
used to dream our dreams there?

705
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,395
We used to stand on the Cliffside...

706
01:20:57,395 --> 01:21:00,315
right there, right in front of us was
something so much more powerful

707
01:21:00,315 --> 01:21:01,650
than we'll ever be.

708
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:03,568
And that image came to me.

709
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:05,654
That image came to me,
and they couldn't see past it.

710
01:21:05,654 --> 01:21:09,366
Now, I know I can do that again.
I can build a wall.

711
01:21:09,366 --> 01:21:11,576
I can build a wall,
and I can deceive them.

712
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:20,293
What are you gonna do?

713
01:21:22,546 --> 01:21:25,507
The only thing that we can do.

714
01:21:31,596 --> 01:21:32,389
No.

715
01:21:32,556 --> 01:21:34,224
No! No!

716
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,268
Not David!

717
01:21:36,476 --> 01:21:39,855
He's not one of them! No!

718
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:10,218
<i>Possible 417.
All units respond and echo your 10-4.</i>

719
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:20,353
<i>Multiple suspects.
Possible 417.</i>

720
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,648
<i>All units respond and echo your 10-4.</i>

721
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:25,692
<i>41-A.</i>

722
01:22:27,068 --> 01:22:29,154
<i>41-A, do you copy?</i>

723
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:32,782
<i>Echo, 41-A. Do you copy?</i>

724
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:35,076
Okay, we're in position.
Send 'em in.

725
01:22:35,243 --> 01:22:38,622
<i>Roger, this is 2-A.
I copy. 241 in progress. Stand by.</i>

726
01:22:57,349 --> 01:22:59,225
What are you waiting for?

727
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:01,186
You got your orders.

728
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:35,929
Get out!

729
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:33,982
- More death.
- Survival.

730
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:45,076
Tell us what arrangements
you have made for us.

731
01:26:46,077 --> 01:26:48,830
Well, I haven't had much time.

732
01:26:50,874 --> 01:26:53,168
It is 11:22.

733
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:56,337
What are you anxious about?

734
01:26:57,672 --> 01:26:59,757
The arrangements.

735
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:02,552
Oh, yes. Actually, I...

736
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,971
I left my notebook out in the car.

737
01:27:04,971 --> 01:27:07,140
I wonder if somebody
could go out and...

738
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:10,643
get my notebook
from the front seat of my car.

739
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:12,270
David?

740
01:27:14,022 --> 01:27:15,732
No.

741
01:27:26,326 --> 01:27:29,287
I am unable to see
what you're thinking.

742
01:27:29,537 --> 01:27:31,206
Well, I'm just...

743
01:27:31,206 --> 01:27:35,126
just wondering who's gonna go out
and get the notebook from my car.

744
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:36,878
- David.
- No.

745
01:27:58,066 --> 01:28:00,693
You are successfully
blocking your thoughts.

746
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:30,890
You are thinking...

747
01:28:31,849 --> 01:28:34,060
...of a brick wall.

748
01:28:41,609 --> 01:28:44,195
Why do you keep looking
at the clock?

749
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:55,581
David.

750
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:59,294
Come on.

751
01:28:59,294 --> 01:29:01,421
- We're going now.
- Mother, no.

752
01:29:14,934 --> 01:29:16,644
Take your place.

753
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:04,567
Stop it! Leave her alone!

754
01:30:05,193 --> 01:30:06,444
Jill, take him! Take him!

755
01:30:06,611 --> 01:30:08,946
Go now! Go!

756
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:05,646
Don't worry, David.

757
01:32:06,397 --> 01:32:10,276
We'll go someplace where
nobody knows who we are.
