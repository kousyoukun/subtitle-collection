1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
                                    
                                   

2
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:46,024
Did you hear that?

3
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,692
What?

4
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,403
Say, Barbara?

5
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,246
Did you...
Did you hear that?

6
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,484
Could've sworn I heard whispering.

7
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,254
You were reading my mind.
That's all.

8
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,125
My thoughts sound like whispers.

9
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,630
Oh, yeah?

10
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,223
And what were you thinking?

11
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,030
I love you, Doc.

12
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:25,334
You sure make it fun to wake up
before dawn. I'll tell you that.

13
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,978
Frank?

14
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,630
- Did you finish last night?
- No.

15
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,642
Oh, honey.

16
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,736
It's a quarter to 6:00.
It's important.

17
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,278
Thanks.

18
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,953
That's everything.

19
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:39,664
Helium for the balloons!

20
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,702
I'm picking up a tank at Harold's
right after I drop you off...

21
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:44,430
per your instructions.

22
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:47,969
Did I think of that?
Cool.

23
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,635
I must be starting to get
this delegating authority stuff.

24
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:53,612
Well, Mrs. Magoo...

25
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,739
I guess that's why
they made you principal.

26
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:58,844
I guess so.

27
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:03,422
- Honey, don't smoke.
- Come on. You're gonna make me crash.

28
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:07,416
Look, I'll quit smokin' when you
decide to get pregnant, all right?

29
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:19,831
Hey, guys!

30
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:36,686
- Be careful.
- Here I come.

31
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:38,987
Watch it.
Watch your step.

32
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:40,993
Thanks. Okay.

33
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,864
You all right?

34
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:49,062
Hey, Jill!

35
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,838
- Who's the chef?
- Oliver.

36
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:59,072
Oh, great.
I love burnt hot dogs.

37
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,114
Thanks. So when's Ben coming home?

38
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:03,547
Six weeks, four days and...

39
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:04,982
nine hours.

40
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:10,082
- Watch the edges. Don't spill it.
- I got it.

41
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:12,091
Let's take it over here.

42
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:15,094
- Hey, Callie. How are ya?
- Frank. Good to see you.

43
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:17,096
Hey, where's my helium?

44
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:21,100
- Say you love me, baby.
- Not until you get me my helium.

45
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:24,103
Righty-o.
I'll get right on it, dear.

46
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,196
See ya.

47
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,207
- Oh, you go here.
- Okay.

48
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:31,267
There's Jill.
I've got those receipts here.

49
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,272
- Hey, how ya doin'?
- Hey, man, how the hell are ya?

50
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:37,846
- All right, bye.
- Bye. See you later.

51
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,754
- Barbara!
- Hey, Frank!

52
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,867
Good morning, Sam.

53
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:59,099
And you must be Cindy.
It's nice to finally meet you.

54
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:03,040
How are you today?
Shall we go in and take a look around?

55
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:06,805
You're both gonna love this place.

56
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,061
- Hey, Harold.
- Morning, Doc.

57
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,123
- Hey, Frank.
- Doc, how the hell are ya?

58
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:30,431
Headin' over to the school fair?

59
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:33,234
I gotta go to Butler County today,
make my rounds at the hospital.

60
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:37,299
Try this muscle machine I made,
show everybody how strong you are.

61
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:41,803
I should probably just sit in the shade
and watch you young guys do it.

62
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,479
- See ya, tough guy.
- Right.

63
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:58,960
- Okay, thanks, Jill.
- We need finger paints.

64
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:00,966
Okay, I'll get 'em.

65
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:19,982
Finger paints. Okay.

66
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,355
Yikes.

67
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:15,300
Well, a civilian pilot
spots the smoke...

68
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:19,930
and then I get here and find two
of my officers passed out like babies.

69
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:23,271
Everything on that side
of the white line is out cold.

70
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:26,141
So somebody starts talkin'
about chemical weapons...

71
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,407
somebody hits the panic button...

72
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,972
and then you people are callin'.

73
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:34,111
- There you go.
- Look, there is no research lab.

74
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:36,417
There is no chemical plant.

75
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:40,357
There is no toxic waste dump.
There is no nuclear plant.

76
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,588
- There's no nothin' around here.
- Okay.

77
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:47,665
Nothing on the news channels
Nothing on the news services.

78
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,895
- Nobody's got it yet.
- Good.

79
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:55,136
I'm just gonna take myself in there
and get a look-see.

80
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:07,019
- Hey, Ed.
- Hey.

81
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:09,749
- That's Frank McGowan's truck, right?
- What's left of it.

82
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:13,281
- Lucky you wasn't in town today, Doc.
- What's going on here?

83
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:16,556
Nobody knows nothin',
not even that Fed doctor down there.

84
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:20,793
She brought this whole circus with her,
and they ain't got a clue.

85
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:37,812
Go on out there and see what the hell's
goin' on. Be careful.

86
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:40,250
- Stay here?
- Yeah, we're just waitin'.

87
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,810
All right, good.

88
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:05,734
Pull him back!
Get him outta there!

89
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:13,017
- Get him out!
- Stay back!

90
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:15,486
Hits 'em like a hammer, Doc.
That's all we know.

91
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:18,319
- Some kind of chemical, gas?
- No, it can't be.

92
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:23,021
The edges of the affected area
are well-defined, stationary.

93
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:25,394
Doc, this is Dr. Susan...

94
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:28,025
Verner.
Like Turner, with a "V."

95
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:31,995
Epidemiologist,
National Science Foundation.

96
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:34,644
- M.D.?
- Yeah.

97
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:37,036
He's breathing. Good pulse.
I think he just fainted.

98
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:39,445
Is Midwich affected by this?

99
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:42,040
- My hunch would be yes.
- My wife's in Midwich.

100
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:45,576
We tried to get through for the last
six hours. Nobody picks up or calls out.

101
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:49,216
Could somebody please get me
some blood and urine samples?

102
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:54,262
- What's the call?
- Ninety-eight.

103
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:57,433
You got one?
Okay, all right.

104
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:00,902
Just take it easy.
Somebody get him a blanket.

105
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:09,189
Barbara. Thank God.
Are you all right?

106
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,926
Sweetheart, are you okay?

107
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:17,598
- I'm cold.
- Come on. Let's go home.

108
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,091
Heavenly Father...

109
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,094
we mourn these lives...

110
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:18,190
cut short without warning
or apparent purpose.

111
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,600
We search for a reason
and find none.

112
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:26,808
We have become accustomed
to the power of science...

113
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:31,006
so when we were struck down, we turned
to science and asked, "Why?"

114
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,706
But it could not answer.

115
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:37,014
So now we turn our eyes
toward heaven...

116
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:41,318
and seek our comfort
in God's infinite mercy.

117
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,355
Let us pray.

118
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:48,022
Our Father, Who art in heaven...

119
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:50,031
hallowed be Thy name.

120
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,193
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

121
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:55,635
on Earth as it is in heaven.

122
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:58,833
Give us this day
our daily bread...

123
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:00,842
and forgive us our trespasses...

124
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,368
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

125
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:06,711
And lead us not into temptation...

126
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:08,716
but deliver us from evil.

127
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:12,015
For Thine is the kingdom
and the power...

128
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,955
and the glory forever and ever.

129
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,389
Amen.

130
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:00,697
Did you ever hear
of Charles Fort?

131
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,635
He wrote
The Book of the Damned...

132
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:04,798
about things nobody's
been able to explain...

133
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:09,140
like frogs falling from the sky,
blue snow, red rain.

134
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:11,145
Are you suggesting I read him?

135
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:13,738
No, no.
It's just that...

136
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:16,979
sometimes mysteries
don't get solved.

137
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:19,213
I mean, what if something
like this happens again?

138
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,717
I don't know.
What do I do? Can I call you?

139
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,454
Well, of course you can call me.

140
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:29,464
Oh, and by the way, I suggest
you read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

141
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,796
As Sherlock Holmes once said...

142
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:33,801
"When you've eliminated
the impossible...

143
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:36,531
whatever remains,
however improbable...

144
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:38,539
must be the truth."

145
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,165
It's not possible.

146
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:07,566
You made a mistake.
Do it again.

147
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,802
Well, I mean, I don't have a problem
running the tests again, but...

148
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:16,334
I have felt like this before in the
morning. It is just some kind of bug.

149
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,421
Melanie?

150
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:52,010
What's the matter?

151
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:58,348
Maybe I can help.

152
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,820
No. You can't.

153
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,755
There they are!
Hey, you guys!

154
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,356
We're empty!
We need some more here!

155
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:14,561
Hi, how are you?
Oh, it's good to see you.

156
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:25,739
Hey, Ben, this is fantastic.

157
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:38,213
Callie, look up and smile.

158
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:47,729
So, Ben, after a year in Japan...

159
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:50,027
did you ever think you'd have
to get used to being a dad?

160
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,112
Hello, Doc.

161
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,183
I said hello.

162
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:21,461
- How long you been standing there?
- Oh, ages.

163
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,123
Liar.

164
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:27,763
Hey, big guy.

165
00:22:33,142 --> 00:22:35,167
Why are you
kissing me like that?

166
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:41,239
I wanted to know first,
so I used a home pregnancy kit.

167
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:43,785
Well, honey, you know those...
those are unreliable.

168
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:48,046
And that's why I went to see
Dr. Cornright to make sure.

169
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:49,716
Gonna open it?

170
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,076
Hi. You got a minute?

171
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:12,739
Sure.

172
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:27,753
Well, everything's positive.

173
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,390
You are pregnant.

174
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:38,736
We'd been trying, you know.

175
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:41,974
Look, um...

176
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,809
I wanted to tell you something
before you hear it from somebody else.

177
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:51,010
There's a lot of pregnancies.
I mean, a lot.

178
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:54,079
Much more than would
normally be expected.

179
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,559
What do you mean?

180
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:02,092
Well, um...

181
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:05,362
Is something wrong with my baby?

182
00:24:05,435 --> 00:24:08,927
It's nothing to indicate that.
You're a normal, healthy young woman...

183
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:11,667
Alan, don't talk to me
like a doctor.

184
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:18,212
All the pregnancies...

185
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:20,408
seem to date from
the day of the blackout.

186
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:22,075
Oh, no!

187
00:24:34,163 --> 00:24:36,723
Dr. Susan Verner has flown in...

188
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,996
This is all 'cause of
that blackout, ain't it?

189
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:43,334
- Just come out and say something!
- They don't know for sure!

190
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:45,966
They are all gonna be deformed!

191
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:47,873
Why won't everyone say it?

192
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,845
Wait a minute.
That's not true!

193
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:54,872
That's... Excuse me! That's not true.
There's no reason to believe that.

194
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,920
Barbara and I are pregnant.
We know how you feel.

195
00:24:57,987 --> 00:25:01,150
We know what a lot of you are thinking,
so let me say right now...

196
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:03,715
the same thing I've told
a lot of you individually.

197
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,092
The standard tests
have not revealed one abnormality.

198
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,791
Anywhere. Not one.
All right?

199
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:13,097
Let's listen to Dr. Verner, please.

200
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:16,104
She's come to talk to us.
Dr. Susan Verner, ladies and gentlemen.

201
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:23,536
I wanna start off by saying we are all
very concerned about your well-being.

202
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:29,075
But ultimately it will come down
to individual decisions.

203
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,213
And I understand that
these decisions will be...

204
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:36,725
probably the most intimate,
personal, difficult decisions...

205
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:39,227
that you ever make in your life.

206
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:41,229
However, because your pregnancies...

207
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:43,697
have attracted intense
scientific interest...

208
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:45,700
including the National
Institute of Health...

209
00:25:45,768 --> 00:25:47,565
and National Science Foundation...

210
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:51,471
those of you who decide
to have your child...

211
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,566
will have all
prenatal expenses paid.

212
00:25:53,643 --> 00:25:58,080
You'll also receive $3,000
monthly as an allowance.

213
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:05,546
If you allow your child to be
examined and tested on a regular basis.

214
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:08,988
Is that $3,000 a family?

215
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:11,322
What if your wife and your daughter
both have kids?

216
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,220
Then you would receive $6,000.

217
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:24,031
Look, I don't want you
to interpret this allowance...

218
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:26,574
as some sort of a pressure.

219
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:30,942
It isn't. It's your decision.
And if you decide to terminate...

220
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:34,141
then of course you have
the right to do that.

221
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,186
You can do it privately,
or if financially unable...

222
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,585
a medical team
will be brought in next week.

223
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:42,590
- The choice is yours.
- That's killing babies.

224
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:52,058
Are you okay?

225
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:55,532
Ben's moving out.

226
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:57,937
Oh, Callie.

227
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,941
He won't believe me.

228
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:04,245
What are you gonna do?

229
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:08,272
I can't keep it.

230
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:10,285
I mean, it can't be Ben's.

231
00:27:11,988 --> 00:27:14,149
I just don't...

232
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:16,157
I just don't understand.

233
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:22,162
Something very strange is happening
to all of us.

234
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,234
You know, they say the...

235
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,160
the Roberts girl is a virgin.

236
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:34,667
What are you going to do?

237
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:37,337
I don't know.

238
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:39,440
- You all right?
- Yeah.

239
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:44,646
It was just a dream.

240
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,011
- Let's go back to sleep, huh?
- Yeah.

241
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:06,495
What's going on, Doctor?

242
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:08,161
Nothing.

243
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:12,900
They have apparently decided
to keep their babies.

244
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:15,739
All of them? Why?

245
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,740
That's a very good question.

246
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:31,766
Nurse!

247
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,671
- Keep pushing! Push!
- All right, Mom!

248
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:40,683
Okay, here we go.
Here we go. Almost.

249
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:43,584
Almost done!
Good, Mom. That's good.

250
00:30:43,654 --> 00:30:45,246
Push, push, push.

251
00:30:52,696 --> 00:30:55,722
That's it.
That's it.

252
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,598
You're doing great!
Take a deep breath and...

253
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:00,637
Deep breath and push!

254
00:31:00,704 --> 00:31:02,399
Push, push, push!

255
00:31:02,473 --> 00:31:05,704
Come with that.
Push a little more.

256
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,904
- Push, Barbara, push.
- A little more.

257
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:12,710
- Oh, it hurts.
- I know. Push.

258
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:19,814
- Help me. Help me!
- We've got a problem!

259
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:24,588
ICU. Now!

260
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:38,105
- Push, push, push!
- Come on!

261
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:40,200
- Yeah! There we go!
- Good, Barbara!

262
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:41,539
And there we go.

263
00:31:41,612 --> 00:31:43,876
Beauty!
Lookin' great, sweetie.

264
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:45,540
Good job.

265
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:47,811
- It's a girl, honey.
- Is it all right?

266
00:31:47,885 --> 00:31:49,512
- It's a girl?
- She's fine.

267
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:51,145
Push!

268
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:53,986
Yes! There we are!

269
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:57,994
- There we are. Clamp this.
- Look, here's your baby.

270
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:02,760
Oh, God.

271
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,767
Oh, my baby.
Look at him.

272
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:06,769
He's beautiful.

273
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:30,216
Come on, just breathe once.
Oxygen. Oxygen.

274
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:32,262
Watch the B.P.

275
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:34,263
Come on, sweetie,
you can do it.

276
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:38,097
Push. Doctor, do you think you can
get your ass over here and help me?

277
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:41,104
Push!
Bear down on her!

278
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:46,508
All right, here we go!
Come on, push! Give me one big push!

279
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:48,306
Come on, here we go!
Come on!

280
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:54,575
I'm sorry.
It's stillborn.

281
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:02,352
- Get some fluid in her.
- Yes, Dr. Verner.

282
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:40,992
Hey, how we doin'?
Everything all right?

283
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:42,999
We lost the Roberts baby.

284
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:45,830
Oh, God. How?

285
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,837
Respiratory failure.

286
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:49,839
Umbilical asphyxia.

287
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:20,702
Where did you take the baby?
I saw you take Melanie's baby outside.

288
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:22,898
I took the baby for an autopsy.

289
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:25,305
I didn't want
the other mothers to see.

290
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:59,039
I baptize thee...

291
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:01,236
in the name of the Father...

292
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:03,177
and the Son...

293
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:05,181
and the Holy Spirit.

294
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:06,841
Amen.

295
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:12,351
I got you.
I got you.

296
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:20,830
Let us pray.

297
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:23,093
Heavenly Father, we thank You...

298
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:26,159
that by the water
of the Holy Spirit...

299
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:29,569
You have bestowed upon these,
Your servants, the forgiveness of sin...

300
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,575
and have raised them
to the new life of grace.

301
00:35:32,643 --> 00:35:35,305
Sustain them, O Lord,
in Your Holy Spirit.

302
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:38,507
Give them an inquiring
and discerning heart...

303
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:41,073
the courage to will
and to persevere...

304
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:44,086
the spirit to know
and to love You...

305
00:35:44,154 --> 00:35:46,987
and the gift of wonder
and joy in all Your work.

306
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:49,685
- Amen.
- Amen.

307
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:08,238
You're a good girl.

308
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:11,543
That's a good girl.
Yeah.

309
00:36:11,615 --> 00:36:15,551
Note how the section of hair is flat
on one side and arced on the other...

310
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:17,382
like a capital "D."

311
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:19,547
Right.

312
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:22,558
The texture is, I don't know...
It's unusually soft.

313
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:27,991
What did you think
when you looked at her nails?

314
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:30,966
Narrower than normal.

315
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:33,434
Any results yet
from the DNA testing?

316
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:35,438
Common genetic characteristics.

317
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:38,737
Almost as if they're siblings
from the same parent.

318
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,541
But it's way too early
to have anything conclusive.

319
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:48,145
Hey, baby.

320
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:50,911
What ya doin'?

321
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:07,603
You can spell your name.

322
00:37:11,408 --> 00:37:13,342
How can you spell your name?

323
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:19,213
How can Mommy's...

324
00:37:19,283 --> 00:37:22,275
smart little boy spell his name?

325
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,001
Sweetie, was the soup too hot?

326
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,015
Okay, baby.

327
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:53,448
We're gonna go see
our friend Mara.

328
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:55,110
Yeah.

329
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:51,900
Oh, God!

330
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,683
Are you crazy?
How could you... Stop it!

331
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:11,657
Oh, God!

332
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,668
Honey, can't you tell me
what happened?

333
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:16,179
No! God, no!

334
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:30,166
I understand there are
some recent developments at Midwich.

335
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:33,227
Yes.

336
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:37,240
The children are beginning to interact
more with the general community.

337
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:41,244
There have been a few casualties...
I should say accidents, suicides...

338
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:43,746
that might be related to
contact with the children...

339
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:46,750
but no direct physical
violence was involved.

340
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:48,752
I have also been trying...
unsuccessfully...

341
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,755
to get Dr. Chaffee
back on the program.

342
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:55,759
His daughter's the leader, isn't she?
He's probably got his hands full.

343
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:58,318
Personal considerations
aren't important, are they?

344
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:01,765
I think that the opportunity
to study these children...

345
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:05,291
should take precedent
over any considerations.

346
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:09,363
Let's cut to the chase here.

347
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:11,409
It is now of interest
to national security...

348
00:42:11,476 --> 00:42:15,435
that we continue to carefully
monitor their developing powers.

349
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:20,609
I ask for another year's grant.

350
00:43:34,893 --> 00:43:36,485
Good afternoon, children.

351
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,056
Mara, why do you smile?

352
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,602
You're trying to hide
your thoughts from us.

353
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:50,040
Just how deeply do you see?

354
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:53,407
Everything active in your mind.

355
00:43:53,478 --> 00:43:57,312
But the process that leads
to the spoken words eludes us.

356
00:43:57,382 --> 00:44:01,443
Why do you speak some thoughts
and not others?

357
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:06,085
Wouldn't it be a noisy world
if we said everything we thought?

358
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:18,036
Okay, I'm gonna put a drop of this
in your eyes. It won't hurt.

359
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:20,266
Okay, I'm gonna put a drop of this
in your eyes. It won't hurt.

360
00:44:58,543 --> 00:45:00,477
I'm sorry. Calm down!

361
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:02,445
I'm gonna wash your eye out!

362
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:06,644
Okay, open your eyes!
It's all right!

363
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,984
It's okay!
It's okay!

364
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:23,603
How's the doctor?

365
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:27,014
Corneal scarring.

366
00:46:27,082 --> 00:46:30,950
- Most likely permanent blindness.
- How did it happen?

367
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,215
Doesn't remember much.

368
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,223
It'll be listed as an accident.

369
00:46:37,726 --> 00:46:39,990
It was the children.

370
00:46:40,062 --> 00:46:42,929
There's no proof of that.

371
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:44,932
What I want to know is...

372
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,400
are the people
in this town safe?

373
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:51,971
What are they gonna do to us?

374
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,635
- Hi.
- This has got to stop.

375
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,770
They don't belong
in regular classes.

376
00:46:57,846 --> 00:47:01,373
It's getting dangerous.
The other children can't learn.

377
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,918
I was thinking
maybe you could teach them.

378
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:06,546
They seem to respect you.

379
00:47:06,622 --> 00:47:10,615
Respect? No. They don't even know
the meaning of that word.

380
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:13,890
Why bother? It doesn't make
any difference what we do.

381
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:17,759
We need you.

382
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:24,129
What am I gonna teach them?
What am I possibly going to teach them?

383
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:26,731
Humanity.

384
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,689
Hello, sweetheart.

385
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,031
Come on.

386
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:30,970
There's no need for you
to become emotional.

387
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,966
I'm old enough
to do things by myself.

388
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:47,213
Hey, David?

389
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:54,818
You wanna talk about what happened
at the clinic today?

390
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:59,760
Why should I be experiencing
emotion at this moment?

391
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:04,565
What is that word
you're thinking?

392
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:07,237
What is "empathy"?

393
00:49:12,614 --> 00:49:15,708
So if I have felt pain...

394
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:18,912
I should be able
to identify with others...

395
00:49:18,987 --> 00:49:21,785
who feel pain.

396
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:24,519
Yeah. Yes.

397
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:38,264
Good night, David.

398
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:50,301
What's the matter?

399
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:55,510
Want some?

400
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:00,045
I'm sorry.

401
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:04,191
I just can't hack it.

402
00:51:47,002 --> 00:51:50,836
"God said, 'Let us make man...

403
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:52,931
in our image...

404
00:51:53,008 --> 00:51:55,169
after our likeness. "'

405
00:51:56,578 --> 00:51:59,775
But "image"does not mean
outer image...

406
00:51:59,848 --> 00:52:04,148
or every statue
or photograph would be man.

407
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,049
It means the inner image...

408
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:12,059
the spirit, the soul.

409
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:17,258
So we gather here today...

410
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:20,665
to remember the inner beauty...

411
00:52:20,736 --> 00:52:22,829
of one who lost her hold.

412
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:27,705
Melanie Roberts somehow
lost that image of herself...

413
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:33,237
as a creature made
in God's bountiful spirit.

414
00:52:34,316 --> 00:52:37,581
But what of those in our midst...

415
00:52:37,653 --> 00:52:41,783
who do not have
individual souls...

416
00:52:41,857 --> 00:52:43,518
or spirits?

417
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:46,726
They have one mind...

418
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:49,286
that they share between them...

419
00:52:49,364 --> 00:52:51,491
one spirit.

420
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:55,801
And they have the look of man...

421
00:52:57,139 --> 00:52:59,369
but not the nature of mankind.

422
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,378
What are you doing here?

423
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,509
Looking for the baby.

424
00:53:14,222 --> 00:53:17,157
The one who was born with us...

425
00:53:17,225 --> 00:53:19,159
the one who died.

426
00:53:21,363 --> 00:53:23,297
How do you know about that?

427
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:29,562
The baby's not here.
She was taken away.

428
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:31,572
Where?

429
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,232
I don't know.

430
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:40,647
Do you have a memory
of the baby?

431
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,253
But it bothers you.

432
00:53:47,922 --> 00:53:51,119
It hurts.
It hurts to lose a loved one.

433
00:53:52,761 --> 00:53:54,854
She was to be with me.

434
00:53:57,298 --> 00:53:59,266
We were to be together.

435
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,364
How do you know that?

436
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:22,823
You've lost someone too.

437
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:11,836
Listen, I think I can teach them.

438
00:55:11,906 --> 00:55:13,874
Well, anyway, I'll try.

439
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:18,804
I never told David
about the Roberts baby.

440
00:55:21,116 --> 00:55:22,515
Right.

441
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:25,417
And then he said,
"She was to be with me"?

442
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:27,478
What did that mean?

443
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,382
I don't know.

444
00:55:37,198 --> 00:55:40,224
Are they paired up,
like a mate?

445
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:08,159
Well, what can I teach
such bright young students?

446
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:11,822
What about human physiology?

447
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,131
That's at least something
I know a little bit about.

448
00:56:15,203 --> 00:56:18,070
For example, does anybody here
know how the eye works?

449
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:20,266
Do you mean how do we see, or...

450
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:22,605
Well, what else can the eye do?

451
00:56:22,677 --> 00:56:26,807
- The eyes are...
- The eyes are the windows of the soul.

452
00:56:27,615 --> 00:56:32,052
Yes, that's right, Mara.
I see you've been reading Proverbs.

453
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,884
I was speaking to Robert.

454
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:38,619
The eyes are
the windows of the soul.

455
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:47,798
Right.

456
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:50,235
All right, if you'd rather
talk about philosophy...

457
00:56:50,305 --> 00:56:54,537
instead of physiology,
let's talk about the soul.

458
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:56,804
Alan. Sorry.

459
00:56:56,878 --> 00:56:59,073
Can you come to my office
for a minute, please?

460
00:57:00,515 --> 00:57:04,952
Yes. I'll be right there.
While I'm away...

461
00:57:05,019 --> 00:57:08,887
why don't you each take out a volume
of the encyclopedia and...

462
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:20,257
and try to learn a little
something about our culture.

463
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:42,912
I know your game.

464
00:57:42,991 --> 00:57:44,959
I know what you're up to.

465
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:48,621
Ever since you got here,
I been watchin'.

466
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:51,164
Watchin' people leave this town...

467
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:54,633
watchin' things die.

468
00:57:54,702 --> 00:57:57,102
Ya ain't right.
None of ya.

469
00:57:57,171 --> 00:58:00,834
And one of these days,
somebody's gonna do somethin' about it.

470
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:07,305
I don't like the way
you're lookin' at me, boy.

471
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,718
I got a gun too,
and I ain't the only one.

472
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:18,418
One day somebody's gonna
get up on a rooftop...

473
00:58:18,493 --> 00:58:22,896
and they're gonna start picking
you little bastards off...

474
00:58:22,964 --> 00:58:26,491
one by one by one.

475
00:58:38,546 --> 00:58:41,447
Well?
Ain't ya gonna do somethin'?

476
00:58:41,516 --> 00:58:45,008
Ain't ya gonna bawl
like all the other little pissants?

477
00:58:46,888 --> 00:58:48,253
Do somethin', damn it!

478
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:01,753
God.

479
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:51,775
There are going to be changes.

480
01:01:02,153 --> 01:01:03,745
God.

481
01:01:05,489 --> 01:01:07,116
God help us.

482
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:11,287
The children did it.
I know they did it.

483
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:13,296
And my daughter was involved.

484
01:01:13,364 --> 01:01:15,696
Now, who are they?

485
01:01:17,034 --> 01:01:19,059
I'd originally thought
they were some form of mutation...

486
01:01:19,136 --> 01:01:22,367
some abrupt evolutionary jump.

487
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,738
It was their
communal consciousness...

488
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:29,269
but I couldn't explain the blackout
or the mass pregnancies.

489
01:01:30,982 --> 01:01:33,610
Midwich isn't the only colony
of such children.

490
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:40,880
In a township in northern Australia,
30 infants were born in a single day.

491
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,756
They all died within
ten hours of birth.

492
01:01:43,828 --> 01:01:45,762
In an Inuit community
outside of Anchorage...

493
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:48,162
a group of ten children were born.

494
01:01:48,232 --> 01:01:51,668
There were 20 births in a small village
near the Turkish-Iranian border.

495
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:56,363
Each location was remote, isolated...

496
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,965
and each had a blackout
the same as Midwich.

497
01:01:59,043 --> 01:02:01,068
And how long have you
known about this?

498
01:02:01,145 --> 01:02:04,046
The way I see it,
there's three possibilities.

499
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:06,413
Number one: Parthenogenesis...

500
01:02:06,484 --> 01:02:09,248
the development of a fetus
without fertilization.

501
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,311
I know.
I don't buy that, either.

502
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:15,223
Number two: We do know the C.I.A.
Slipped large doses of LSD to men...

503
01:02:15,293 --> 01:02:20,390
without them knowing to study effects
of psychotropes on gene structure.

504
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:22,432
So maybe the government
engineered the blackout...

505
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,867
then artificially inseminated
your women with super sperm.

506
01:02:25,937 --> 01:02:27,928
First they knocked 'em out,
then they knocked 'em up.

507
01:02:31,375 --> 01:02:34,105
And what's the third possibility?

508
01:02:34,178 --> 01:02:37,341
Xenogenesis.
Implantation.

509
01:02:37,415 --> 01:02:40,145
The production of an offspring
unlike that of the parent.

510
01:02:41,552 --> 01:02:43,952
Or should I say host?

511
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,794
Come back to the project, Alan.

512
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:28,231
Not just a matter
of protecting your daughter.

513
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:32,133
As you can see,
it goes far, far beyond that.

514
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,270
You have to put this
in the back of your mind.

515
01:03:38,342 --> 01:03:40,276
Don't even think about it
when you're around the children.

516
01:03:40,344 --> 01:03:43,404
- Don't ever let them know you know.
- Why didn't you tell us?

517
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:47,281
- I mean, why didn't you warn us?
- Because I couldn't.

518
01:03:47,351 --> 01:03:51,845
Well, I couldn't. If anybody else knew,
the children would know.

519
01:03:51,922 --> 01:03:54,823
Look, I have spent years of my life
building a wall around this...

520
01:03:54,892 --> 01:03:58,658
hiding it so they couldn't read
what was in my mind.

521
01:03:58,729 --> 01:04:02,722
But as their powers grow stronger, they
just keep looking deeper and deeper.

522
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,031
I need your help.
Would you please just...

523
01:04:06,103 --> 01:04:08,162
come back to the project?

524
01:04:59,957 --> 01:05:02,050
We've made our decision.

525
01:05:02,126 --> 01:05:04,993
Discussion will not
change our plans.

526
01:05:07,932 --> 01:05:11,663
We will live in the abandoned barn
outside of town.

527
01:05:12,503 --> 01:05:15,336
You will bring us supplies.

528
01:05:15,406 --> 01:05:17,397
You can't stop us, you know.

529
01:05:18,242 --> 01:05:19,834
Don't try.

530
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:29,781
You've been discussing us
with Dr. Verner.

531
01:05:30,688 --> 01:05:32,622
What did she tell you?

532
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:39,120
You are hiding something.

533
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,182
I'm not letting you go.

534
01:06:42,226 --> 01:06:44,194
You haven't been given an option.

535
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:46,320
Have you?

536
01:06:50,334 --> 01:06:53,565
You know, you don't always have
to do everything they tell you.

537
01:06:55,172 --> 01:06:59,632
- We are the same.
- No. You're not.

538
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,610
You're David.
You're different.

539
01:07:35,212 --> 01:07:37,578
I've come to get Julie.
Have you seen her?

540
01:07:41,585 --> 01:07:43,519
Is she at the barn?

541
01:07:44,855 --> 01:07:45,913
Fine.

542
01:08:10,914 --> 01:08:14,077
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.

543
01:08:14,151 --> 01:08:16,779
You're okay, aren't ya?

544
01:08:16,854 --> 01:08:18,845
Julie doesn't want
to come with you.

545
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:21,624
Well, damn it,
I don't care what Julie wants.

546
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:25,059
Her mother's frantic.
I'm bringin' her home.

547
01:09:29,157 --> 01:09:32,285
Some kind of big accident, Doc,
out by the barn.

548
01:09:34,228 --> 01:09:35,490
Alan, wait!

549
01:09:35,563 --> 01:09:38,088
Alan, I was just informed...

550
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:40,691
that the other towns with
blackout children have been destroyed.

551
01:09:40,768 --> 01:09:44,568
- What? All of them?
- Everyone, the adults and the children.

552
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:47,437
They couldn't evacuate without
the children knowing what was happening.

553
01:09:47,508 --> 01:09:50,500
- The governments gave no warning.
- God. What about Midwich?

554
01:09:50,578 --> 01:09:52,512
I've been told to pack and get out.

555
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:56,243
I'm leaving tonight.
Do the same. Get out while you can.

556
01:10:08,196 --> 01:10:09,629
Another man is dead.

557
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,630
Why do you hate us so much, Mara?

558
01:10:17,705 --> 01:10:21,573
It isn't a matter of hate.
It is a biological obligation.

559
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,911
You are thinking of
what happened to the others.

560
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,574
Then our actions
shouldn't surprise you.

561
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:33,552
We have to survive no matter what
the cost. We are the only ones left now.

562
01:10:33,621 --> 01:10:36,089
I don't see why
we can't reach an understanding.

563
01:10:36,157 --> 01:10:37,624
Why can't we just live together?

564
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:40,490
If we coexist,
we shall dominate you.

565
01:10:40,561 --> 01:10:42,392
That is inevitable.

566
01:10:42,463 --> 01:10:45,159
Eventually you will
try to eliminate us.

567
01:10:45,233 --> 01:10:47,326
We are all creatures
of the life-force.

568
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:50,859
Now it has set us at one another
to see who will survive.

569
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,366
- That's a cruel sport.
- Life is cruelty.

570
01:10:55,443 --> 01:11:00,005
We all feed on each other, exploit
each other in some way to survive.

571
01:11:01,916 --> 01:11:03,406
I don't agree with you.

572
01:11:03,484 --> 01:11:06,715
I think that adaptation
is the key to survival.

573
01:11:06,787 --> 01:11:09,779
Cooperation and symbiosis...

574
01:11:09,857 --> 01:11:12,826
and compassion.

575
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:16,989
Why do you think your own survival
depends upon emotion from us?

576
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:20,591
Should we pity you?
Empathize with your plight?

577
01:11:20,668 --> 01:11:22,636
You should feel!

578
01:11:22,703 --> 01:11:24,637
You should feel something!

579
01:11:26,107 --> 01:11:28,507
Without feelings, you're nothing.

580
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:31,101
You're just second-rate mimics
of a higher organism.

581
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,569
That's right, a higher organism.

582
01:11:33,648 --> 01:11:36,515
We're your superiors
in our capacity to love.

583
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:39,519
Without compassion,
you're a doomed species.

584
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,954
Emotion is irrelevant.
It is not our nature.

585
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,955
Well, I'm not so sure
you're right about that, Mara.

586
01:11:52,033 --> 01:11:54,968
Still, you are aware
of the other colonies...

587
01:11:55,036 --> 01:11:57,971
so you must be,
in some basic sense...

588
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:00,064
aware of who...

589
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:02,735
what we are.

590
01:12:04,211 --> 01:12:05,701
Yes.

591
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:10,444
So the question becomes,
"Should you be allowed to live?"

592
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:19,115
You're suddenly
thinking of an ocean.

593
01:12:24,732 --> 01:12:28,099
You're blocking your thoughts
rather effectively with this image.

594
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:34,297
We must leave here,
spread out, disperse.

595
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:38,505
Soon we will have reached a stage
where we can form new colonies.

596
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:41,514
You will arrange a method
of getting us away from here.

597
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:44,642
What if I refuse you?

598
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,210
You are a prisoner
of your values...

599
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:50,280
and you won't be able
to deceive us.

600
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:54,594
You know that, don't you?

601
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:59,292
Father?

602
01:13:01,402 --> 01:13:04,496
Yes, I know that.

603
01:13:04,572 --> 01:13:06,506
Make your arrangements.

604
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:08,769
We must leave tonight.

605
01:13:35,836 --> 01:13:39,169
You're thinking
of the one who died.

606
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,401
She was to be my partner.

607
01:13:43,611 --> 01:13:46,341
Yes, it's true.

608
01:13:46,414 --> 01:13:48,882
Without a mate,
you are of less importance to us.

609
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:53,081
And your development
of emotions is disturbing.

610
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:59,990
We can't leave you behind, David.

611
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,119
It is time we resolved this.

612
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:45,370
Hurry up!

613
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:47,430
Begone, everyone who is proud...

614
01:14:47,508 --> 01:14:51,945
and bring him low, and tread down
the wicked where they stand!

615
01:14:52,012 --> 01:14:54,708
- This is the last of it.
- All right, get going.

616
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:57,842
Bind their faces
in the world below.

617
01:14:57,918 --> 01:15:00,409
Then will I also
acknowledge to you...

618
01:15:00,488 --> 01:15:04,618
that your own right hand
can give you victory!

619
01:15:19,073 --> 01:15:22,065
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to talk to you.

620
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:25,077
I really think
that I can help you.

621
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,789
Send 'em back to hell
where they belong!

622
01:15:48,569 --> 01:15:51,333
You've got to stop!
Please stop!

623
01:15:51,405 --> 01:15:53,703
You gotta stop!
Sarah, please!

624
01:16:25,806 --> 01:16:28,536
Hast thou eyes of flesh?

625
01:16:29,343 --> 01:16:32,391
Dost thou see as man sees?

626
01:19:07,245 --> 01:19:10,078
A state of emergency
has been declared.

627
01:19:10,148 --> 01:19:12,082
Please return to your homes...

628
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:15,449
and remain there
until further notice.

629
01:19:21,259 --> 01:19:23,591
- Come here! Grab my hand, quick!
- Come on!

630
01:19:23,662 --> 01:19:28,429
Clear the streets.
Unauthorized people will be arrested.

631
01:19:32,037 --> 01:19:34,597
This is a state of emergency.

632
01:20:10,442 --> 01:20:11,909
Oh, please be home.

633
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:19,680
The children murdered Sarah.

634
01:20:19,751 --> 01:20:22,515
Susan Verner too.
I just found her at the clinic.

635
01:20:22,587 --> 01:20:25,351
The state police are on their way
out to the barn.

636
01:20:25,424 --> 01:20:27,415
They're going after the children.
We've gotta stop them.

637
01:20:27,492 --> 01:20:30,393
No, you can't go out there.
You'll just get hurt.

638
01:20:30,462 --> 01:20:33,522
- We've gotta try!
- The state police can't do anything.

639
01:20:33,598 --> 01:20:35,828
- It'll be a bloodbath.
- We gotta try.

640
01:20:35,901 --> 01:20:38,995
No, Jill!
Now, listen to me.

641
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:40,662
There's another way.

642
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:43,105
Now, look, something happened today.

643
01:20:43,175 --> 01:20:45,541
I was able to block Mara
from reading my thoughts.

644
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:46,941
How?

645
01:20:47,012 --> 01:20:49,776
I suddenly thought of the ocean.

646
01:20:49,848 --> 01:20:52,373
I suddenly saw the view
in front of our house.

647
01:20:52,451 --> 01:20:55,648
You know how Barbara and I
used to dream our dreams there?

648
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,984
We used to stand
on the cliff side...

649
01:20:58,056 --> 01:21:01,787
and in front of us was something so much
more powerful than we'll ever be.

650
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:06,126
Well, that image came to me,
and they couldn't see past it.

651
01:21:06,198 --> 01:21:09,531
I know I can do that again.
I can build a wall.

652
01:21:09,601 --> 01:21:11,865
I can build a wall
and deceive them.

653
01:21:18,777 --> 01:21:20,574
What are you gonna do?

654
01:21:23,081 --> 01:21:25,015
The only thing that we can do.

655
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:36,857
No! Not David!

656
01:21:36,928 --> 01:21:40,227
He's not one of them! No!

657
01:22:07,058 --> 01:22:11,154
Possible 417.
All units respond and echo your 10-4.

658
01:22:18,703 --> 01:22:20,796
Multiple suspects.
Possible 417.

659
01:22:20,872 --> 01:22:23,841
All units respond
and echo your 10-4.

660
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:25,501
41-A.

661
01:22:27,579 --> 01:22:29,513
41-A, do you copy?

662
01:22:31,116 --> 01:22:33,243
Echo, 41-A. Do you copy?

663
01:22:33,318 --> 01:22:35,616
Okay, we're in position.
Send 'em in.

664
01:22:35,687 --> 01:22:38,952
Roger, this is 2-A.
I copy. 241 in progress. Stand by.

665
01:22:57,709 --> 01:23:00,473
What are you waitin' for?
You got your orders.

666
01:23:34,412 --> 01:23:36,175
Get out!

667
01:24:49,513 --> 01:24:51,447
Oh, God.

668
01:26:31,748 --> 01:26:34,114
- More death.
- Survival.

669
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:46,496
Tell us what arrangements
you have made for us.

670
01:26:46,563 --> 01:26:49,031
Well, I haven't had much time.

671
01:26:51,401 --> 01:26:55,565
It is 11:22.
What are you anxious about?

672
01:26:58,108 --> 01:27:00,542
The arrangements.

673
01:27:00,611 --> 01:27:03,239
Oh, yes.
Actually, I, uh...

674
01:27:03,313 --> 01:27:05,577
I left my notebook
out in the car.

675
01:27:05,649 --> 01:27:11,281
I wonder if somebody could go out and
get it from the front seat of my car.

676
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:29,839
I am unable to see
what you're thinking.

677
01:27:29,907 --> 01:27:31,704
Well, I'm just...

678
01:27:31,775 --> 01:27:34,972
just wondering who's gonna go out
and get the notebook from my car.

679
01:27:58,569 --> 01:28:00,833
You are successfully
blocking your thoughts.

680
01:28:30,033 --> 01:28:34,333
You are thinking of a brick wall.

681
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:45,207
Why do you keep
looking at the clock?

682
01:28:57,527 --> 01:29:01,520
- Come on. We're going now.
- Mother, no.

683
01:29:15,112 --> 01:29:16,773
Take your place.

684
01:30:02,325 --> 01:30:04,589
Stop it!
Leave her alone!

685
01:30:05,829 --> 01:30:08,093
Jill! Take him!
Go now! Go!

686
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,572
Don't worry, David.

687
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:09,817
We'll go someplace where
nobody knows who we are.

688
01:32:10,305 --> 01:32:16,354
