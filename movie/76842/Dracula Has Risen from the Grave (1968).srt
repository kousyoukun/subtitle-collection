

1
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,431
- Morning.
- Good morning, Johann.

2
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:40,730
Morning.

3
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,856
What is it, boy?

4
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,918
Dear God, when shall we be free?

5
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,757
When shall we be free of his evil?

6
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:30,537
A year has passed since Dracula...

7
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,748
perpetrator of these obscene evils,
was destroyed...

8
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,316
and I, Ernst Muller...

9
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:41,719
Monsignor of the Holy Catholic Church
in the province of Keinenberg...

10
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:46,525
decided it was time I paid a visit
to the little village in the valley...

11
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,587
to see that all was well.

12
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,328
Giddap.

13
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:36,462
Boy.

14
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:41,610
Boy, come here. You need not fear me.

15
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,279
Where is the Reverend Father?

16
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:56,524
Can you understand me?
Where is your priest?

17
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,391
Why is he not here saying Mass?

18
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:09,399
Poor boy.

19
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,531
Then show me where he is.

20
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:33,060
I have just inspected your church.

21
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,121
But for this boy here, it was empty.

22
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,893
Why was it empty?

23
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:42,026
Why were you not there saying Mass?

24
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,371
I was there, Monsignor.

25
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,072
I have said Mass.

26
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:49,805
You have said Mass already
into an empty church?

27
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,105
- Yes.
- Then why was the church empty?

28
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,042
Well?

29
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,746
I think you know, Monsignor.

30
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:01,383
No, I do not know.

31
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:06,217
I know that your church
was once vilely desecrated.

32
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,730
But the perpetrator of that ghastly deed...

33
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,333
was destroyed some 12 months ago.
Is that not so?

34
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:19,235
Was he not sent to his doom
in the waters of your mountains?

35
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,410
And was he not, therefore,
destroyed forever?

36
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:24,636
Is that not so?

37
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:29,881
Then why were you not there
in church this morning?

38
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,816
It's the shadow, sir.

39
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,746
- Shadow?
- The shadow of his castle, sir.

40
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,519
It touches the church.

41
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:38,753
In the evenings it touches it.

42
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,295
Whose castle?

43
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,055
Count Dracula? Is that who you mean?

44
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,297
Why do you not speak his name?
He cannot harm you anymore.

45
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:55,476
He is destroyed, is he not? And he is dead.

46
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,906
Is he dead or not?

47
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,817
- Yes, he is dead.
- Well, then.

48
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:05,145
But the evil is still there.

49
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:08,384
We can feel it in the shadow,
even in the church.

50
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,586
There is no evil in a house of God!

51
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,696
Landlord...

52
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,463
I wish to talk to my priest in private.

53
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:38,250
Now then, perhaps you'd better tell me
all about it.

54
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:42,223
It's as they say, Monsignor.
The castle is still evil.

55
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,717
You can feel it.

56
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,030
You can't imagine what it's like.

57
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,831
I am not unacquainted with evil.

58
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,562
The question is,
what are we going to do about it?

59
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,107
I don't know.

60
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,544
Has anybody been up there
since that time?

61
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,976
- To the castle?
- Yes.

62
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:10,383
- Have you been?
- No. Never.

63
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,884
Then you should have gone
to prove there is nothing to fear.

64
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:16,648
Me?

65
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,386
I will come with you.

66
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,123
- When?
- Tomorrow, first light.

67
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:28,461
You will be ready.
Otherwise I shall have to go alone.

68
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:33,370
That would not be easy for me.
You know the mountains well. I do not.

69
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,676
I will go with you.

70
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,278
Thank you, Father.

71
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,350
I never doubted you.

72
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,028
Dawn will be about 6:00 tomorrow.

73
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:58,796
We will meet at 5:30.
Please do not be late.

74
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:31,760
All ready, Father?

75
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,298
Let us pray together.

76
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:19,435
Dear God.

77
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:32,646
Come.

78
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,355
No, I can't.

79
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,755
You must follow me.

80
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:41,719
- There is nothing to fear.
- There is.

81
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,963
It will soon be dark.

82
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:50,460
- I'm not coming.
- I tell you, there is nothing to fear.

83
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:53,141
- Have courage.
- Please.

84
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,309
Very well.

85
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,072
You need not come with me.

86
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,415
But you must wait here until I return,
you understand?

87
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,545
Yes.

88
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:09,448
You'll be quite safe here.

89
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:14,586
When I return,
we will go down again together.

90
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,230
I understand.

91
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:26,537
- Wish me well then.
- I do.

92
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,880
And may God protect you.

93
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,053
Father!

94
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,557
Open up!

95
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,407
A brandy. Give him a brandy.

96
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,587
Bar the door.

97
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,621
It's done.

98
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:46,256
The evil is destroyed forever.

99
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:50,289
- You went there to the castle?
- Yes.

100
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:58,295
I read the service of exorcism...

101
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,240
and sealed the door with a cross.

102
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:05,535
His spirit will never leave there
to trouble you again.

103
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:07,572
It's a miracle.

104
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,877
You have the thanks of everyone here.

105
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,447
- Has your priest not returned yet?
- The priest?

106
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,784
I had to leave him.

107
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,725
He came down before me.

108
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,627
Yes. The priest was here, Monsignor.

109
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,093
Thank God. Where is he now?

110
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,704
He went off by himself.
He said he wished to be alone.

111
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,465
- I don't know where he's gone.
- I see.

112
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:36,372
I understand how he must feel.

113
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:42,711
When he returns,
please tell him what I have done...

114
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,947
and that I wish him Godspeed.

115
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:48,656
- Then you're leaving now, sir?
- Yes.

116
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:53,617
There's nothing more to be done here,
and I must go home to Keinenberg.

117
00:21:57,966 --> 00:21:59,934
Who has done this thing?

118
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:14,479
Monsignor.

119
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,481
It was the Monsignor.

120
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,888
Anna.

121
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:08,867
Ernst. You're back. That's good.

122
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,237
I wasn't expecting you.

123
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,532
You look tired.

124
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,474
Yes, Anna, I am tired.

125
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:20,308
- I traveled through the night.
- Not only tired, but worried.

126
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,875
- Did something happen?
- Yes.

127
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:25,543
Can you tell me about it?

128
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,088
Not just now, Anna. Later, perhaps.

129
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,056
Later will be best.

130
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:34,960
Now you sit there and rest a moment.
I'll fetch your slippers.

131
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:38,460
These long journeys are too much for you
at your age.

132
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:42,162
You should speak to your superiors.
If you don't, I shall.

133
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:46,067
There are plenty of younger men
who could do your work.

134
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:47,540
Young men whom you have trained.

135
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:50,976
You should be allowed
to stay here in Keinenberg with us.

136
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:54,072
There are six churches here. Or near here.

137
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,781
Quite enough
for you to keep your eye on...

138
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,980
without all this
journeying around the countryside.

139
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:02,748
Let me take your boots off.

140
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:10,189
I'll put these slippers on.

141
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:14,367
- You're as good as a wife to me, Anna.
- Not quite, Ernst.

142
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,767
I shouldn't joke about such things to you,
I know.

143
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,901
There. Off you go and rest.

144
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:26,380
- Plenty of time for joking tonight.
- Tonight?

145
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,578
Yes. We're having a little dinner party.

146
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:31,915
It's Maria's birthday.
Did you not remember?

147
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:33,284
Of course.

148
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,346
- How is she, Anna?
- Maria?

149
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,583
She's as happy as ever.
Why should she not be?

150
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:42,558
A fine education, a beautiful home.

151
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:46,394
You're very good to her, you know, Ernst.

152
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:48,368
I owe it to my brother.

153
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:50,329
Yes.

154
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:52,940
Anyone can give charity.

155
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:56,705
You give us more than that.
You give us your love.

156
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:59,580
Now off you go and rest.

157
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:03,311
I'll wake you in plenty of time
for the party.

158
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:04,943
Try not to worry so.

159
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,047
I'm sure whatever it was that was wrong,
you will have put it to right.

160
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:12,383
God knows I hope so, Anna.

161
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:17,847
- You rested? You look much better.
- I feel much better.

162
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:23,495
- Who is our guest to be?
- Maria has invited a friend.

163
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,061
A young man, Ernst.

164
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,539
Be gentle with him.
He's very precious to her.

165
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:33,967
He works in the Cafe Johann in the bakery.

166
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,169
That's just to keep him while he studies.

167
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:37,677
He's a clever boy, Ernst.

168
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:41,182
He's going to be a doctor,
or professor, or something.

169
00:26:57,132 --> 00:26:58,224
Good.

170
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:02,800
Making ourselves pretty, are we?

171
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:06,839
You're going to meet her mama
for the first time tonight, aren't you?

172
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:09,342
Now, you take a good look at her mama,
my boy...

173
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:13,871
because that's exactly what your girl's
going to look like after you've married her.

174
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:17,644
- That is, if her mama lets you marry her.
- And why shouldn't she?

175
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,187
Why shouldn't she?
Why should she? What are you?

176
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:24,282
Young, hard-working,
good-looking, abstemious.

177
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,226
You're a second-class pastry cook.

178
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:29,824
And if you work hard...

179
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,026
you may in time
become a first-class pastry cook.

180
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:35,194
And who will want to marry you then?

181
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,431
Up every morning before dawn.

182
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:39,467
- That's not for me, Max.
- No?

183
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,442
- No. I'm ambitious.
- I see.

184
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,843
Those books of yours.
Where are they going to get you?

185
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,506
Away from here for a start.

186
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:51,382
- So, you don't like it here?
- I didn't say that, Max.

187
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,187
I do like it here.

188
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,779
It keeps me fit.
And I have time off to study.

189
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:58,223
- And the food's good?
- And the food's good.

190
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:01,222
I'm grateful. Really, I am.

191
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:03,392
Funny way to show it.

192
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:07,925
What I don't understand is what you hope
to get out of these books of yours.

193
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:12,271
What life's about, something of the truth.

194
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,968
The truth. What do you want with that?

195
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:18,774
Look, if you want to be a success in life,
forget the truth.

196
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,714
I can't just forget it.

197
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,649
Then stay a pastry cook.
That way it doesn't matter.

198
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:25,583
Do you want any money?

199
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:28,048
Not tonight, Max.

200
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,949
Mind your manners.

201
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:35,325
And don't go telling her mother
the truth about the way she looks...

202
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,625
and what her cooking tastes like.

203
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,929
That truth she can do without.

204
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,556
Come on, out of the way, all of you.

205
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,300
Move along.

206
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,004
Your dumplings are boiling over, Zena.

207
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:33,851
And your fly's undone,
but I didn't want to mention it.

208
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,324
Teach you to be cheeky.

209
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:43,696
Hello. You're looking pretty.

210
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:46,258
Yes, that's what I thought.

211
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,761
Maria here?

212
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,498
Always Maria.
What about giving me a chance?

213
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:53,268
Zena, you've got more boyfriends
than you can remember.

214
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:54,933
I've always got room for one more.

215
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:57,341
Come on, Paul. Come on, join in.

216
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:24,896
Very good, Paul.

217
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:28,573
- Here, take this glass.
- What now?

218
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:30,201
What indeed.

219
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:32,873
It's my best suit.

220
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:36,978
- Zena, I'm going out tonight.
- Not with me, you're not.

221
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:40,185
I'm meeting Maria's mother.
I want to make a good impression.

222
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,019
I don't want to go through
soaked through smelling of beer.

223
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,251
Now please!

224
00:30:57,405 --> 00:31:00,636
Maria, I'm afraid your boyfriend's
a bit wet about the ears.

225
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,472
Hello, Maria.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but l...

226
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:05,740
Look at you, and tonight of all nights.

227
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:10,045
- Don't worry. He'll dry out in the night air.
- Come on, you'll have to come as you are.

228
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,678
Mother hates me to be late,
especially tonight.

229
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:16,212
Yes, Paul, don't be late for mama!

230
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:28,065
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes, I suppose so.

231
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,066
- But we must hurry.
- Does it still smell?

232
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:35,672
- Yes, a bit.
- Do you think your mother will notice?

233
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:38,303
She'll notice all right,
but she won't say anything.

234
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,745
- Good job your uncle isn't home yet.
- Paul.

235
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,875
Come on, I'll race you home.
Maybe it will dry you out.

236
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:55,825
Mother, this is...

237
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,665
Happy birthday, Maria.

238
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:03,033
That's a fine way to greet your uncle.

239
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:06,699
Uncle Ernst, it's lovely to see you.

240
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:10,369
- I just didn't expect you, that's all.
- So I gathered.

241
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,403
Paul, I'm terribly sorry.

242
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,716
Mother, this is Paul.
I've told you all about him, haven't I?

243
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,810
Yes, you have, frequently.

244
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,850
- How are you, Paul?
- Frau Muller.

245
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:28,020
And this is my Uncle Ernst.

246
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,962
So you're on your best behavior.

247
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,591
Sir.

248
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:36,927
Just the way to make the poor boy
feel at his ease.

249
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:40,372
Pay no attention to her, Paul.
Make yourself at home.

250
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:45,270
- Ernst, give Paul a drink.
- Certainly. A glass of wine?

251
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:49,415
Paul doesn't drink. Do you, Paul?

252
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:51,878
No, sir. That is, only beer.

253
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,815
I haven't any beer, I'm afraid.

254
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,379
That's all right. I had one before I left.

255
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,986
Only one?

256
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,884
You noticed.

257
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,487
It was rather noticeable.

258
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,458
It was the students at the Cafe Johann.

259
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:09,401
They played a trick on Paul
and spilled beer all over him.

260
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,267
It was a sort of game, you see...

261
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:13,967
where the glass
was on the end of a stick...

262
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,704
and I went around
with another glass of beer.

263
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:20,009
I had to drink, and there was beer in the...

264
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:25,346
- Would you accept these, Frau Muller?
- Thank you.

265
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:53,540
You know, Anna, when I'm on my travels,
there's only one thing I dream about:

266
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,382
Your cooking.

267
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:58,382
Your mind should be
on higher things, Ernst.

268
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,650
- Give Paul a cigar.
- Would you like a cigar, Paul?

269
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:05,757
No, thank you, sir. To be truthful,
they make me feel a little sick.

270
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:08,125
You know, I like that in a man, Paul.

271
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:13,022
Not enough people
say what they really mean these days.

272
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,326
Many people speak only to impress...

273
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:20,502
not stopping to think
if what they're saying is really true.

274
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:22,972
Happens in the church, too, you know.

275
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:25,672
I hear it only too often on my rounds.

276
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,842
- There are six churches here, you know.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,508
Which one do you attend, by the way?

278
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:33,110
Paul doesn't come from Keinenberg, Uncle.

279
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:35,178
- This isn't his home.
- I know, but...

280
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:38,020
He works very hard in the bakery.
He doesn't have much time.

281
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:41,061
- But on Sundays?
- I don't go to church, sir.

282
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,563
- You don't go to church?
- No, sir.

283
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,458
- You're not a Protestant, are you?
- No, sir.

284
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,735
Thank Heaven for that.

285
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,772
I'm an atheist, sir.

286
00:34:57,745 --> 00:35:00,612
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm an atheist, sir.

287
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,377
You mean you deny the existence of God?

288
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:07,681
I don't deny it. I just don't believe it.
It's my own opinion, sir.

289
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:11,149
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:16,020
And you come here to my house,
speaking this blasphemy?

291
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,595
You asked for my beliefs, sir,
and I've given them.

292
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:23,966
It was an honest answer, sir.
You said you liked people to be honest.

293
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:26,235
Don't be impertinent.

294
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:41,013
Would you like me to leave, Frau Muller?

295
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:45,758
Yes, I think it would be best.

296
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:51,955
I'm sorry, Frau Muller.
Thank you very much for your hospitality.

297
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,000
Good night, sir.

298
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,633
- Paul...
- Maria, you will stay here.

299
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,609
Oh, Mama.

300
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:17,285
- Night-night, Zena.
- Good night. Go on, go home.

301
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,384
Come on, girl. Let's go and have a party.

302
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:50,086
- Give me a schnapps, Zena.
- Back so soon?

303
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,523
Give me a schnapps. A large one.

304
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,059
- You don't drink schnapps.
- Well, I'm starting now.

305
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,959
No need to ask you
if something went wrong.

306
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:03,026
No, it did. Her uncle turned up.

307
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,530
And you had a row with him.

308
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:07,936
He asked my opinion.

309
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:10,034
And you gave it.

310
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,474
- I only told him the truth.
- When will you learn?

311
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,452
- How can people enjoy that?
- They don't. They just like the effect.

312
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:24,889
- I don't feel any effect.
- You will.

313
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,790
I'll have another one while I'm waiting.

314
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,287
Go to bed.

315
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:03,892
You coming with me?

316
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,190
You want to be careful what you're saying.

317
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:15,704
What have you done with my legs?

318
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:18,870
Come on.
Up to your room before Max gets back.

319
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,111
- Zena.
- Come on.

320
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:33,490
- What are you doing, Zena?
- I'm undoing your jacket.

321
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,938
You can put me down now, Zena.

322
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,129
Hello, Zena.

323
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:14,767
What are you doing in my bed?

324
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,702
- You may well ask.
- Yes.

325
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:20,734
Well, I am asking.

326
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:41,284
Does she kiss you like that?
I bet she doesn't.

327
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:45,896
Might as well make you comfortable.

328
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,491
- Zena.
- Hello.

329
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,662
What's going on?

330
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,330
- Nothing.
- What happened?

331
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:56,172
Three large schnapps.
That's what happened. He's not used to it.

332
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:58,912
You better help me get him into bed.

333
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:10,947
Zena, don't...

334
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:16,254
Well, he's your boyfriend.

335
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:19,824
You tuck him up.

336
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,234
What are you doing in my bedroom?

337
00:40:58,072 --> 00:40:59,471
I feel sick.

338
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,037
- I think I'll have a glass of water.
- I'll get it.

339
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,881
That's better. Have some. It's delicious.

340
00:41:15,923 --> 00:41:19,290
- I can't think why I drink anything else.
- Nor can I.

341
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,687
- I spoiled everything at dinner, didn't I?
- I'm afraid so, Paul.

342
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,364
It's because I always have to
go and tell the truth.

343
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:32,568
Why can't I make
a lot of polite conversation...

344
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,437
like everybody else?

345
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:38,935
What do I have to take things
so seriously for?

346
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,309
Because you're you, I suppose.

347
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,775
Fat lot of good it does me.

348
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:46,345
That's why I love you, Paul.

349
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:50,554
Do you love me, Maria?

350
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:54,026
In spite of everything?

351
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:56,959
Do you still love me?

352
00:42:04,738 --> 00:42:06,467
I think you must...

353
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:09,471
otherwise you wouldn't be here like this...

354
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:11,506
with me.

355
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:24,380
Zena, you still here?

356
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,586
- Is Paul back yet?
- He's upstairs studying.

357
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:31,188
- He's a good boy. He'll go far.
- Not too far, I hope.

358
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:34,634
Well, I... What are you doing here?

359
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:37,462
I've locked up
and you've got a long way to go.

360
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:39,768
Do you want to stay the night
or something?

361
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,068
No, thanks.

362
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:45,134
I've had enough trouble with
all those students, without you as well.

363
00:42:45,212 --> 00:42:47,874
Besides, a walk's good for my figure.

364
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:51,645
- Off you go, straight home.
- Good night.

365
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:05,202
Don't come with me.

366
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:06,871
- Are you sure?
- I'm quite sure.

367
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:09,472
- Shall I see you tonight?
- I'll try.

368
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,745
Goodbye.

369
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:50,913
You gave me a shock.
What are you doing here?

370
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,853
I didn't go home last night.

371
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:55,792
You've been here all night? But why?

372
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:58,730
I just didn't feel like going home.
Do you want some coffee?

373
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:01,529
- Hey, what's the matter...
- I'm all right!

374
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:05,464
Now do you want some coffee?

375
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:07,572
Yes, please.

376
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:40,170
Serve the priest, will you, Zena?

377
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:51,379
You want something, Father?
Breakfast, hot rolls, chocolate?

378
00:47:52,185 --> 00:47:55,245
I wondered if perhaps there was a room...

379
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:57,584
which I could rent for a few days?

380
00:47:57,658 --> 00:47:59,683
- Sorry.
- We do have a room.

381
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:02,627
The one next to Paul is empty.

382
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:05,593
If I could have it.

383
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,830
It's a very small room, Father.
You couldn't swing a cat in it...

384
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:12,769
and it's right at the top of the house.

385
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,798
I don't care what it's like or where it is.
If you'd be so kind.

386
00:48:17,945 --> 00:48:21,745
You can have it for a few days.
Paul, show him up, will you?

387
00:48:22,182 --> 00:48:24,514
Do you have any baggage, Father?

388
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:28,417
- Just this.
- I'll take it.

389
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,283
You're very kind.

390
00:48:42,135 --> 00:48:44,968
What's come over you?
I don't want a priest here.

391
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:48,098
Is this your first visit
to Keinenberg, Father?

392
00:48:49,443 --> 00:48:50,501
Yes.

393
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:54,172
I'm here on church business.

394
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,385
Do you know the Monsignor
by any chance?

395
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:04,049
We have met. I know his niece better.

396
00:49:05,993 --> 00:49:07,324
His niece?

397
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,979
Paul, get me some more glasses. Please?

398
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:47,246
- Paul!
- Coming.

399
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:52,414
Would you take over for me for a minute?
I don't feel very well.

400
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:53,982
I said you didn't look well.

401
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,494
- Just for a while.
- Yes, of course.

402
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,606
What's the matter? What have I done?

403
00:52:51,184 --> 00:52:53,709
- There is a girl.
- A girl? What girl?

404
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:58,055
- The niece of the Monsignor.
- Maria?

405
00:52:58,692 --> 00:52:59,886
Bring her to me.

406
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,690
What do you want her for? You've got me.

407
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,190
Bring her to me!

408
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,580
Hey, now, Paul.
Come on, that's not enough.

409
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,283
Hello. You feeling better?

410
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:28,253
Yes, I'm fine now.
You can go back to your studies.

411
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,650
Thanks. You sure you feel all right?

412
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:33,215
Yes. Back to your dreary old books.

413
00:53:34,394 --> 00:53:37,852
Paul, is Maria coming in tonight?

414
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:43,034
- I hope so, if she can get away.
- I'll call you when she comes.

415
00:53:43,236 --> 00:53:45,636
Thanks, Zena. You're a good sort.

416
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:58,407
Some more beer, Zena. Hurry up.

417
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:01,880
I'm dying of thirst.

418
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:03,752
I'll give you a hand, Zena.

419
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,851
- Zena, hurry up.
- Come back, Zena.

420
00:54:07,727 --> 00:54:09,092
We'll never get a drink now.

421
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,130
- Hello, Zena.
- Hello, Maria.

422
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:13,927
- Where's Paul?
- He's downstairs in the bakery.

423
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:15,126
Thank you.

424
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:18,266
- Hello, Maria.
- Hello, Max.

425
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:20,067
Lovely girl, that.

426
00:54:33,553 --> 00:54:35,043
Paul, come on.

427
00:54:54,174 --> 00:54:55,198
No!

428
00:55:41,354 --> 00:55:43,686
- What have you done with Maria, Paul?
- Maria?

429
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,156
She was looking for you.

430
00:55:45,225 --> 00:55:47,386
Stop messing about.
You know she's not here.

431
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,757
Where is she, Paul?

432
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:50,090
- Who?
- Maria.

433
00:55:50,163 --> 00:55:52,063
What have you done with her, Paul?

434
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:55,863
- Is she really here?
- Yeah, she went down there to find you.

435
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:35,065
- Where's Maria, Paul?
- He can't find her.

436
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:36,765
She's not down there, Max.

437
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:41,212
You'd better go and try upstairs,
but I'm sure she went down to the bakery.

438
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:44,114
Sneaked her up to his room.
That's what he's done.

439
00:57:14,948 --> 00:57:16,575
Are you hurt? What happened?

440
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:18,640
- Don't leave me!
- I won't.

441
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:22,277
But how did you get here like this?

442
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,654
I don't know.
I came to look for you, and then I...

443
00:57:26,493 --> 00:57:28,256
It's all right, darling.

444
00:57:34,234 --> 00:57:36,930
- You have failed me.
- But I...

445
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,769
- You must be punished.
- Forgive me.

446
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:45,842
I wasn't to know. I tried.

447
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,881
But what do you want her for?
You've got me.

448
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:53,248
Well, you've got me!

449
00:58:18,978 --> 00:58:21,776
Here, have a drink of this.
It will do you good.

450
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:24,180
- Now what was it?
- She went down there to find me...

451
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,741
and the next thing she knew,
somebody had attacked her.

452
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:29,344
Something about a man with burning eyes
staring at her.

453
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,219
I saw him. I know I did.

454
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:34,886
No, love. It was in your mind.
You just thought you saw him, that's all.

455
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:37,691
She may have fainted.
Do you think she should go to bed?

456
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,288
Yes, come upstairs and rest.

457
00:58:39,365 --> 00:58:43,324
No, I can't. I must go home.
Mother will be wondering where I am.

458
00:58:43,403 --> 00:58:46,304
Just until you feel a little better, Maria.

459
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,972
I can't understand it.

460
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:52,067
Now come on up.

461
00:59:52,872 --> 00:59:54,669
Destroy her.

462
01:01:05,111 --> 01:01:08,410
It's all right, darling. There's nobody here.

463
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:17,179
I must have been dreaming.

464
01:01:17,523 --> 01:01:19,457
Here, drink this.

465
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:22,227
Then I'll take you home.

466
01:01:22,528 --> 01:01:26,157
No, you can't. My mother will see.

467
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:28,826
But if you tell her what happened...

468
01:01:29,669 --> 01:01:31,364
No, how can I?

469
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,634
I don't even know what happened myself.

470
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,835
She'd be furious if she knew I'd come here.

471
01:01:39,912 --> 01:01:41,436
I could explain.

472
01:01:41,814 --> 01:01:44,908
No, I don't suppose
that would help much either.

473
01:01:46,853 --> 01:01:48,718
I'm all right, really.

474
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,840
When shall I see you again?

475
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,177
I don't know.

476
01:02:13,946 --> 01:02:16,176
I'll try and come tomorrow.

477
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:20,379
If not, I'll get a message to you.

478
01:02:21,053 --> 01:02:23,851
I'll come with you part of the way anyway.

479
01:03:21,514 --> 01:03:23,744
- Where have you been?
- Mother...

480
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,407
You've been with Paul, haven't you?

481
01:03:25,485 --> 01:03:27,817
- I know it looks like...
- What does it look like?

482
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,219
You should be ashamed of yourself.

483
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,321
Maria, my darling.

484
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,727
Ernst!

485
01:03:45,171 --> 01:03:47,731
Girls. Unreliable, the whole lot of them.

486
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:50,867
Come and go just as they please.
No sense of responsibility.

487
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:54,071
That's what I like about you, Paul.
I can rely on you.

488
01:03:54,146 --> 01:03:56,011
That Zena hasn't turned up all day.

489
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,210
- Went off and never said she was going.
- She was here last night.

490
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:01,549
Last night. I know all about last night.

491
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:03,714
What's the matter with you today?

492
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:06,189
Off with some student, I suppose.

493
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:09,853
Come back again in about a fortnight
and want her job back.

494
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,998
Father.

495
01:04:15,201 --> 01:04:16,998
Will you do something for me?

496
01:04:17,069 --> 01:04:19,503
Will you go and find out how Maria is?

497
01:04:20,172 --> 01:04:21,196
Go to her home?

498
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,265
Yes, she lives with her uncle,
the Monsignor.

499
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:24,707
You must know him.

500
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,474
Will you go and find out how she is
and give her this note?

501
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,448
- Very well.
- Thanks.

502
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:52,496
- I brought you some soup, Maria.
- Thank you, Uncle Ernst.

503
01:04:52,672 --> 01:04:54,071
Sit up now.

504
01:04:59,412 --> 01:05:02,347
Drink it while it's... I've forgotten a spoon.

505
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:04,679
It doesn't matter, Uncle Ernst.

506
01:05:05,618 --> 01:05:07,176
I'm not hungry.

507
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,390
Please forgive me.

508
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,388
There, there.

509
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:21,165
Do you love him, Maria?

510
01:05:21,968 --> 01:05:25,131
- Yes, I do.
- Do you want to tell me about it?

511
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:27,833
Not now.

512
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:31,673
All right. When you're ready.

513
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:34,978
Sleep now.

514
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,279
God bless you, Maria.

515
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,845
Father, what happened?

516
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:26,778
Maria. How is she? Is she well?
Did you give her the note?

517
01:08:27,086 --> 01:08:28,519
- Yes.
- And?

518
01:08:29,755 --> 01:08:32,383
- And?
- She is well.

519
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:36,322
- When can I see her?
- Not yet.

520
01:08:36,896 --> 01:08:39,421
Later she will come here to see you.

521
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,032
- When?
- As soon as she can.

522
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,006
- You are still working here, are you?
- Sorry, Max.

523
01:08:48,073 --> 01:08:49,370
Come on. I need you.

524
01:08:58,684 --> 01:09:01,016
She was lying here just like this.

525
01:09:01,086 --> 01:09:03,054
Not moving and scarcely breathing.

526
01:09:03,122 --> 01:09:05,249
She's sick. She's very sick.

527
01:09:06,425 --> 01:09:08,950
- Was the window open?
- Yes.

528
01:09:09,795 --> 01:09:13,060
Yes, it was open, just like this.
I didn't touch it.

529
01:09:13,766 --> 01:09:16,394
You think she's caught a chill, is that it?

530
01:09:17,603 --> 01:09:18,831
Possibly.

531
01:09:19,138 --> 01:09:22,073
The night air can be very treacherous
at this time of year.

532
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:25,269
- Possibly.
- Ernst, shouldn't we call the doctor?

533
01:09:27,513 --> 01:09:29,708
If she's not better tomorrow.

534
01:09:30,449 --> 01:09:31,973
Tomorrow, yes.

535
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:04,481
- How is she?
- Sleeping like a child.

536
01:10:05,584 --> 01:10:07,415
Did you close the window?

537
01:10:07,486 --> 01:10:10,114
- Yes, but on such a warm night.
- Good.

538
01:10:16,562 --> 01:10:18,792
Don't stay up too late, Ernst.

539
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:22,560
Good night, Anna.

540
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:36,656
You.

541
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:05,221
There, my love. Tell me, what is it?

542
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:08,529
Maria, tell me what happened. What is it?

543
01:13:10,069 --> 01:13:11,559
Anna, help me!

544
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:17,436
Oh, dear God!

545
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:20,174
Here, lean on me.

546
01:13:34,293 --> 01:13:35,692
You must go.

547
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:38,896
You must get him to come here.

548
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:41,057
- You should rest.
- No, Anna.

549
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,267
Listen to me.

550
01:13:44,203 --> 01:13:46,194
You must fetch that boy.

551
01:13:46,972 --> 01:13:49,634
- The one who was here.
- Paul?

552
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:55,237
- Bring him here to me.
- Why Paul?

553
01:13:56,281 --> 01:13:59,808
Because he loves her. He will help her.

554
01:14:02,888 --> 01:14:06,415
- I'll go now, Ernst.
- No. Anna.

555
01:14:09,495 --> 01:14:13,488
Perhaps it is better you do not go
until daylight.

556
01:14:25,577 --> 01:14:29,274
Count Dracula is alive.

557
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,881
During the hours of darkness...

558
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,450
she must never be left alone.

559
01:14:37,789 --> 01:14:39,552
You understand that?

560
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,629
Not for one moment
must you leave her side.

561
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,931
Protect yourself as best you can.

562
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:53,701
There are devices
which may be of some effect:

563
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,665
Charms, herbs.

564
01:14:57,142 --> 01:14:59,167
You will find it all here.

565
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,711
You are a scholar of sorts, I understand.

566
01:15:04,316 --> 01:15:07,444
- Well, I...
- They are all in Latin.

567
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:12,122
Do the best you can. What little time...

568
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,754
- I'll get a doctor.
- No time.

569
01:15:18,797 --> 01:15:22,324
You must swear
to do what I have told you.

570
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:27,404
- I promise.
- You should swear by almighty God...

571
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,409
but you have denied yourself this.

572
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:42,146
You have my word.

573
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:45,479
I know I have.

574
01:15:46,725 --> 01:15:48,090
Thank you.

575
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:53,125
Anna, the boy must stay here.

576
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,361
Yes, of course. Hurry. Get your things.

577
01:15:58,203 --> 01:15:59,864
Come back quickly.

578
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:04,335
There is much to do before dark.

579
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:15,815
- What on earth are you doing?
- Keep my job open for me.

580
01:16:15,887 --> 01:16:17,411
I'll explain later.

581
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:19,953
Father, I need your help. Hurry up.

582
01:16:20,025 --> 01:16:22,516
Come with me, please. Please hurry.

583
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:24,828
What happened?

584
01:17:13,345 --> 01:17:15,779
"The flowers of garlic should be placed...

585
01:17:15,847 --> 01:17:19,305
"on either side of the head
of the one to be protected.

586
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:22,949
"No more than a hand's breadth
away from the throat.

587
01:17:23,588 --> 01:17:26,079
"The oil from the clove of garlic...

588
01:17:26,491 --> 01:17:30,518
"should be smeared around the edges
of any aperture in the wall...

589
01:17:30,796 --> 01:17:32,593
"doors and windows...

590
01:17:33,498 --> 01:17:36,467
"lest the vampire try to gain ingress."

591
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:49,607
He meant to give it to her for her birthday.

592
01:17:51,717 --> 01:17:54,185
It's all right, Frau Muller. You go and rest.

593
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:57,085
I promise you, I'll call you if I need you.

594
01:18:36,161 --> 01:18:38,629
Why don't you go and rest, Father?

595
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,023
No.

596
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,363
Yes. You go and lie down. I can manage.

597
01:19:57,175 --> 01:19:59,336
I can't!

598
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:03,476
What are you trying to do?

599
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:05,539
- He told me to do it.
- He who?

600
01:20:05,617 --> 01:20:08,450
- Who told you?
- Dracula.

601
01:20:10,856 --> 01:20:14,121
How could he tell you? You, a priest?

602
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,990
- Where is he?
- He willed me to do it.

603
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:20,161
I cannot disobey him.

604
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:25,531
Now I'm willing you. Do you understand?

605
01:20:30,342 --> 01:20:33,175
- First you'll tell me where he is.
- No, I can't.

606
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,907
- Second, you'll take me to him.
- No.

607
01:20:35,981 --> 01:20:38,643
You will take me to him, now!

608
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,760
Quickly, before he wakes.

609
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:02,228
Quickly.

610
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:06,236
You must do it now!

611
01:21:23,595 --> 01:21:25,529
Pray! You must pray!

612
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:28,094
- I can't!
- You must.

613
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:31,658
- You must, or he won't die.
- You pray! You're a priest!

614
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:38,341
He won't die!

615
01:21:39,544 --> 01:21:41,205
He isn't going to die!

616
01:22:45,744 --> 01:22:47,769
Maria, get away from here!

617
01:23:12,303 --> 01:23:15,739
Now my revenge is complete.

618
01:23:30,388 --> 01:23:32,583
- What's the matter, lad?
- Max.

619
01:23:34,659 --> 01:23:35,921
It's Maria.

620
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:40,186
Good evening. It isn't often
we see strangers in these parts.

621
01:24:40,258 --> 01:24:42,658
There's a castle
somewhere in the mountains here...

622
01:24:42,727 --> 01:24:44,922
belonging to a Count Dracula.

623
01:24:46,798 --> 01:24:48,732
- Do you know him?
- We know who you mean.

624
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,131
I have to go there.

625
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:54,137
- Why? It's empty. There's no one there.
- Not for long. He's on his way here.

626
01:24:54,205 --> 01:24:57,470
- Dracula? lmpossible.
- It's true. I swear it.

627
01:24:57,542 --> 01:25:00,511
- He's dead. He died months ago.
- No, he's alive.

628
01:25:00,578 --> 01:25:03,547
- He's alive, and he's coming here.
- Then you brought him.

629
01:25:03,615 --> 01:25:05,845
Why can't you leave us alone?
Why must you meddle?

630
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:08,317
- Please listen to me.
- Quiet!

631
01:25:24,669 --> 01:25:26,000
Let me by!

632
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:29,138
- I must get by!
- Be silent!

633
01:25:29,674 --> 01:25:31,164
Please, I have to follow.

634
01:25:31,242 --> 01:25:35,042
If you take my advice, you'll go
straight back to where you came from.

635
01:25:35,113 --> 01:25:37,138
Will someone show me the way
to the castle?

636
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,844
You won't get anyone to go up there
with you, son. Not even in daylight.

637
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:43,615
Will someone just show me the way then?

638
01:25:44,355 --> 01:25:47,256
Surely one of you
has got the courage to do that.

639
01:25:50,662 --> 01:25:53,324
- Come on then.
- You're not going anywhere!

640
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:56,128
We're sick of people
interfering with our lives.

641
01:25:56,201 --> 01:26:00,035
And if we leave things alone,
then maybe he'll leave us alone.

642
01:26:00,505 --> 01:26:03,531
But he's evil, and while he's alive,
none of you will be safe.

643
01:26:03,608 --> 01:26:06,702
Take him upstairs and lock him up
until he cools off.

644
01:26:17,055 --> 01:26:18,682
No, let him go.

645
01:26:19,324 --> 01:26:20,689
He'll be sorry.

646
01:28:10,768 --> 01:28:13,100
Get that thing out of my sight.

647
01:28:15,139 --> 01:28:16,538
Throw it away!

648
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,403
Maria!

649
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:32,935
Amen.
