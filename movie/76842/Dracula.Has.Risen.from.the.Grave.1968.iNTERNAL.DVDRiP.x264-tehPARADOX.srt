1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,289
- Morning.
- Good morning, Johann.

2
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:40,560
Morning.

3
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,953
What is it, boy?

4
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:06,933
Dear God, when shall we be free?

5
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:09,930
When shall we be free of his evil?

6
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:30,785
<i>A year has passed since Dracula...</i>

7
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,619
<i>perpetrator of these obscene evils,
was destroyed...</i>

8
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:37,419
<i>and I, Ernst Muller...</i>

9
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,963
<i>Monsignor of the Holy Catholic Church
in the province of Keinenberg...</i>

10
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:46,136
<i>decided it was time I paid a visit
to the little village in the valley...</i>

11
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:48,641
<i>to see that all was well.</i>

12
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,469
Giddap.

13
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:36,573
Boy.

14
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,742
Boy, come here. You need not fear me.

15
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,379
Where is the Reverend Father?

16
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:56,636
Can you understand me?
Where is your priest?

17
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,511
Why is he not here saying Mass?

18
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,478
Poor boy.

19
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:12,644
Then show me where he is.

20
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:33,167
I have just inspected your church.

21
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:36,211
But for this boy here, it was empty.

22
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:38,002
Why was it empty?

23
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:42,128
Why were you not there saying Mass?

24
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,466
I was there, Monsignor.

25
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,184
I have said Mass.

26
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:49,886
You have said Mass already
into an empty church?

27
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:53,180
- Yes.
- Then why was the church empty?

28
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,140
Well?

29
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:58,853
I think you know, Monsignor.

30
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:01,482
No, I do not know.

31
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:06,324
I know that your church
was once vilely desecrated.

32
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,830
But the perpetrator of that ghastly deed...

33
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,409
was destroyed some 12 months ago.
Is that not so?

34
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:19,336
Was he not sent to his doom
in the waters of your mountains?

35
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:22,503
And was he not, therefore,
destroyed forever?

36
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,720
Is that not so?

37
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:29,966
Then why were you not there
in church this morning?

38
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,892
It's the shadow, sir.

39
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:34,844
- Shadow?
- The shadow of his castle, sir.

40
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:36,599
It touches the church.

41
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,849
In the evenings it touches it.

42
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:40,353
Whose castle?

43
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:44,149
Count Dracula? Is that who you mean?

44
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,358
Why do you not speak his name?
He cannot harm you anymore.

45
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,534
He is destroyed, is he not? And he is dead.

46
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,994
Is he dead or not?

47
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,876
- Yes, he is dead.
- Well, then.

48
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:05,208
But the evil is still there.

49
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,467
We can feel it in the shadow,
even in the church.

50
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:11,675
There is no evil in a house of God!

51
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:16,768
Landlord...

52
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:20,558
I wish to talk to my priest in private.

53
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:38,328
Now then, perhaps you'd better tell me
all about it.

54
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:42,282
It's as they say, Monsignor.
The castle is still evil.

55
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:44,788
You can feel it.

56
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:50,129
You can't imagine what it's like.

57
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:53,001
I am not unacquainted with evil.

58
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,630
The question is,
what are we going to do about it?

59
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,183
I don't know.

60
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:02,597
Has anybody been up there
since that time?

61
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,063
- To the castle?
- Yes.

62
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:10,442
- Have you been?
- No. Never.

63
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,937
Then you should have gone
to prove there is nothing to fear.

64
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,731
Me?

65
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,447
I will come with you.

66
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:24,199
- When?
- Tomorrow, first light.

67
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:28,543
You will be ready.
Otherwise I shall have to go alone.

68
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:33,459
That would not be easy for me.
You know the mountains well. I do not.

69
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:39,755
I will go with you.

70
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,425
Thank you, Father.

71
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:46,518
I never doubted you.

72
00:11:52,734 --> 00:11:55,142
Dawn will be about 6:00 tomorrow.

73
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:58,987
We will meet at 5:30.
Please do not be late.

74
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:31,846
All ready, Father?

75
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:34,354
Let us pray together.

76
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:19,490
Dear God.

77
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:32,705
Come.

78
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,421
No, I can't.

79
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:38,804
You must follow me.

80
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:41,839
- There is nothing to fear.
- There is.

81
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:46,019
It will soon be dark.

82
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:50,515
- I'm not coming.
- I tell you, there is nothing to fear.

83
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:53,189
- Have courage.
- Please.

84
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,359
Very well.

85
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,108
You need not come with me.

86
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,455
But you must wait here until I return,
you understand?

87
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:06,618
Yes.

88
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,497
You'll be quite safe here.

89
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:14,712
When I return,
we will go down again together.

90
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:16,292
I understand.

91
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:26,591
- Wish me well then.
- I do.

92
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,936
And may God protect you.

93
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:04,087
Father!

94
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:16,578
Open up!

95
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:33,425
A brandy. Give him a brandy.

96
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:39,600
Bar the door.

97
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:42,723
It's done.

98
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:46,389
The evil is destroyed forever.

99
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:50,318
- You went there to the castle?
- Yes.

100
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:58,399
I read the service of exorcism...

101
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:01,235
and sealed the door with a cross.

102
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:05,657
His spirit will never leave there
to trouble you again.

103
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,585
It's a miracle.

104
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:10,868
You have the thanks of everyone here.

105
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:15,583
- Has your priest not returned yet?
- The priest?

106
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,803
I had to leave him.

107
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:20,715
He came down before me.

108
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:23,635
Yes. The priest was here, Monsignor.

109
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:26,099
Thank God. Where is he now?

110
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:29,562
He went off by himself.
He said he wished to be alone.

111
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:32,602
- I don't know where he's gone.
- I see.

112
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,567
I understand how he must feel.

113
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:42,866
When he returns,
please tell him what I have done...

114
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:45,951
and that I wish him Godspeed.

115
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,661
- Then you're leaving now, sir?
- Yes.

116
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,534
There's nothing more to be done here,
and I must go home to Keinenberg.

117
00:21:57,966 --> 00:21:59,923
Who has done this thing?

118
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:14,601
Monsignor.

119
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,566
It was the Monsignor.

120
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:02,897
Anna.

121
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:08,988
Ernst. You're back. That's good.

122
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,574
I wasn't expecting you.

123
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:14,537
You look tired.

124
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:16,448
Yes, Anna, I am tired.

125
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:20,407
- I traveled through the night.
- Not only tired, but worried.

126
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:22,875
- Did something happen?
- Yes.

127
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,539
Can you tell me about it?

128
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:28,206
Not just now, Anna. Later, perhaps.

129
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,052
Later will be best.

130
00:23:31,137 --> 00:23:34,920
Now you sit there and rest a moment.
I'll fetch your slippers.

131
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:38,429
These long journeys are too much for you
at your age.

132
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,137
You should speak to your superiors.
If you don't, I shall.

133
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:46,143
There are plenty of younger men
who could do your work.

134
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:47,609
Young men whom you have trained.

135
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:50,944
You should be allowed
to stay here in Keinenberg with us.

136
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:54,150
There are six churches here. Or near here.

137
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:56,700
Enough for you to keep your eye on...

138
00:23:56,786 --> 00:24:00,036
without all this journeying
around the countryside.

139
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:02,912
Let me take your boots off.

140
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,164
I'll put these slippers on.

141
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,457
- You're as good as a wife to me, Anna.
- Not quite, Ernst.

142
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:18,756
I shouldn't joke about such things to you,
I know.

143
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:21,886
There. Off you go and rest.

144
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:26,431
- Plenty of time for joking tonight.
- Tonight?

145
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:29,554
Yes. We're having a little dinner party.

146
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:31,898
It's Maria's birthday.
Did you not remember?

147
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:33,360
Of course.

148
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:35,437
- How is she, Anna?
- Maria?

149
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:39,407
She's as happy as ever.
Why should she not be?

150
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:42,703
A fine education, a beautiful home.

151
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:46,445
You're very good to her, you know, Ernst.

152
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,414
I owe it to my brother.

153
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:50,283
Yes.

154
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,912
Anyone can give charity.

155
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,833
You give us more than that.
You give us your love.

156
00:24:57,593 --> 00:24:59,550
Now off you go and rest.

157
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:03,264
I'll wake you in plenty of time
for the party.

158
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:04,925
Try not to worry so.

159
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:09,014
I'm sure whatever it was that was wrong,
you will have put it to right.

160
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:12,477
God knows I hope so, Anna.

161
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:17,907
- You rested? You look much better.
- I feel much better.

162
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:23,664
- Who is our guest to be?
- Maria has invited a friend.

163
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:26,131
A young man, Ernst.

164
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:31,637
Be gentle with him.
He's very precious to her.

165
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:34,137
He works in the Cafe Johann in the bakery.

166
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:36,134
That's just to keep him while he studies.

167
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:37,637
He's a clever boy, Ernst.

168
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:41,185
He's going to be a doctor,
or professor, or something.

169
00:26:56,912 --> 00:26:57,991
Good.

170
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,866
Making ourselves pretty, are we?

171
00:27:03,377 --> 00:27:06,792
You're going to meet her mama
for the first time tonight, aren't you?

172
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,287
Now, you take a good look at her mama,
my boy...

173
00:27:09,382 --> 00:27:13,795
because that's exactly what your girl's
going to look like after you've married her.

174
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,720
- That is, if her mama lets you marry her.
- And why shouldn't she?

175
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:20,214
Why shouldn't she?
Why should she? What are you?

176
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:24,354
Young, hard-working,
good-Iooking, abstemious.

177
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:27,273
You're a second-class pastry cook.

178
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:29,774
And if you work hard...

179
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,979
you may in time
become a first-class pastry cook.

180
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:35,194
And who will want to marry you then?

181
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:37,488
Up every morning before dawn.

182
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:39,615
- That's not for me, Max.
- No?

183
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:42,454
- No. I'm ambitious.
- I see.

184
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:45,788
Those books of yours.
Where are they going to get you?

185
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,452
Away from here for a start.

186
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:51,410
- So, you don't like it here?
- I didn't say that, Max.

187
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,130
I do like it here.

188
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,788
It keeps me fit.
And I have time off to study.

189
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,256
- And the food's good?
- And the food's good.

190
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,260
I'm grateful. Really, I am.

191
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,347
Funny way to show it.

192
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,970
What I don't understand is what you hope
to get out of these books of yours.

193
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,270
What life's about, something of the truth.

194
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,027
The truth. What do you want with that?

195
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,811
Look, if you want to be a success in life,
forget the truth.

196
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,656
I can't just forget it.

197
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,570
Then stay a pastry cook.
That way it doesn't matter.

198
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,654
Do you want any money?

199
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,073
Not tonight, Max.

200
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,868
Mind your manners.

201
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:35,454
And don't go telling her mother
the truth about the way she looks...

202
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,788
and what her cooking tastes like.

203
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,958
That truth she can do without.

204
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:13,487
Come on, out of the way, all of you.

205
00:29:13,874 --> 00:29:15,202
Move along.

206
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:25,038
Your dumplings are boiling over, Zena.

207
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:33,758
And your fly's undone,
but I didn't want to mention it.

208
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:38,227
Teach you to be cheeky.

209
00:29:40,732 --> 00:29:43,602
Hello. You're looking pretty.

210
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:46,191
Yes, that's what I thought.

211
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:47,692
Maria here?

212
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,449
Always Maria.
What about giving me a chance?

213
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:53,237
Zena, you've got more boyfriends
than you can remember.

214
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:54,952
I've always got room for one more.

215
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:57,326
Come on, Paul. Come on, join in.

216
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,808
Very good, Paul.

217
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:28,480
Here, take this glass. What now?

218
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:30,110
What indeed.

219
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:32,772
It's my best suit.

220
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:37,065
- Zena, I'm going out tonight.
- Not with me, you're not.

221
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,077
I'm meeting Maria's mother.
I want to make a good impression.

222
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:42,950
I don't want to go through
soaked through smelling of beer.

223
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,203
Now please!

224
00:30:57,304 --> 00:31:00,554
Maria, I'm afraid your boyfriend's
a bit wet about the ears.

225
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,392
Hello, Maria.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but l...

226
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:05,634
Look at you, and tonight of all nights.

227
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:10,022
- Don't worry. He'll dry out in the night air.
- Come on, you'll have to come as you are.

228
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:12,563
Mother hates me to be late,
especially tonight.

229
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:16,102
Yes, Paul, don't be late for mama!

230
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:28,038
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes, I suppose so.

231
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:32,080
- But we must hurry.
- Does it still smell?

232
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:35,751
- Yes, a bit.
- Do you think your mother will notice?

233
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,413
She'll notice all right,
but she won't say anything.

234
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,797
- Good job your uncle isn't home yet.
- Paul.

235
00:31:40,886 --> 00:31:43,922
Come on, I'll race you home.
Maybe it will dry you out.

236
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:55,940
Mother, this is...

237
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:00,776
Happy birthday, Maria.

238
00:32:00,863 --> 00:32:02,902
That's a fine way to greet your uncle.

239
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,904
Uncle Ernst, it's lovely to see you.

240
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:10,576
- I just didn't expect you, that's all.
- So I gathered.

241
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,282
Paul, I'm terribly sorry.

242
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:17,584
Mother, this is Paul.
I've told you all about him, haven't I?

243
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,710
Yes, you have, frequently.

244
00:32:20,214 --> 00:32:22,919
<i>- How are you, Paul?
- Frau Muller.</i>

245
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,134
And this is my Uncle Ernst.

246
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:31,006
So you're on your best behavior.

247
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,549
Sir.

248
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,557
Just the way to make the poor boy
feel at his ease.

249
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:40,015
Pay no attention to her, Paul.
Make yourself at home.

250
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:45,318
- Ernst, give Paul a drink.
- Certainly. A glass of wine?

251
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:49,361
Paul doesn't drink. Do you, Paul?

252
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,859
No, sir. That is, only beer.

253
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,863
I haven't any beer, I'm afraid.

254
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:56,445
That's all right. I had one before I left.

255
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:57,868
Only one?

256
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:01,001
You noticed.

257
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:03,537
It was rather noticeable.

258
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:06,329
It was the students at the Cafe Johann.

259
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:09,259
They played a trick on Paul
and spilled beer all over him.

260
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,135
It was a sort of game, you see...

261
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,925
where the glass
was on the end of a stick...

262
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:16,850
and I went around
with another glass of beer.

263
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:20,137
I had to drink, and there was beer in the...

264
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:25,433
<i>- Would you accept these, Frau Muller?
- Thank you.</i>

265
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:53,501
You know, Anna, when I'm on my travels,
there's only one thing I dream about:

266
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:55,344
Your cooking.

267
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:58,259
Your mind should be
on higher things, Ernst.

268
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:01,639
- Give Paul a cigar.
- Would you like a cigar, Paul?

269
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:05,635
No, thank you, sir. To be truthful,
they make me feel a little sick.

270
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:08,055
You know, I like that in a man, Paul.

271
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:13,059
Not enough people
say what they really mean these days.

272
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:16,400
Many people speak only to impress...

273
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:20,524
not stopping to think
if what they're saying is really true.

274
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:22,825
Happens in the church, too, you know.

275
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:25,784
I hear it only too often on my rounds.

276
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:28,876
- There are six churches here, you know.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,537
Which one do you attend, by the way?

278
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:33,000
Paul doesn't come from Keinenberg, Uncle.

279
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,123
- This isn't his home.
- I know, but...

280
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:38,050
He works very hard in the bakery.
He doesn't have much time.

281
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:41,089
- But on Sundays?
- I don't go to church, sir.

282
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,588
- You don't go to church?
- No, sir.

283
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:48,466
- You're not a Protestant, are you?
- No, sir.

284
00:34:48,812 --> 00:34:50,685
Thank Heaven for that.

285
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,817
I'm an atheist, sir.

286
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,655
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm an atheist, sir.

287
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:03,444
You mean you deny the existence of God?

288
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:07,661
I don't deny it. I just don't believe it.
It's my own opinion, sir.

289
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:11,076
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:16,037
And you come here to my house,
speaking this blasphemy?

291
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:19,499
You asked for my beliefs, sir,
and I've given them.

292
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:24,087
It was an honest answer, sir.
You said you liked people to be honest.

293
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:26,386
Don't be impertinent.

294
00:35:38,525 --> 00:35:41,098
<i>Would you like me to leave, Frau Muller?</i>

295
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:45,814
Yes, I think it would be best.

296
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:51,989
<i>I'm sorry, Frau Muller.
Thank you very much for your hospitality.</i>

297
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:58,830
Good night, sir.

298
00:35:58,919 --> 00:36:01,492
- Paul...
- Maria, you will stay here.

299
00:36:06,384 --> 00:36:07,664
Oh, Mama.

300
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:17,133
- Night-night, Zena.
- Good night. Go on, go home.

301
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:20,228
Come on, girl. Let's go and have a party.

302
00:36:46,797 --> 00:36:50,047
- Give me a schnapps, Zena.
- Back so soon?

303
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:52,542
Give me a schnapps. A large one.

304
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:57,137
- You don't drink schnapps.
- Well, I'm starting now.

305
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,929
No need to ask you
if something went wrong.

306
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,971
No, it did. Her uncle turned up.

307
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,430
And you had a row with him.

308
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:07,892
He asked my opinion.

309
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:10,020
And you gave it.

310
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:13,485
- I only told him the truth.
- When will you learn?

311
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:22,487
- How can people enjoy that?
- They don't. They just like the effect.

312
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,703
- I don't feel any effect.
- You will.

313
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,582
I'll have another one while I'm waiting.

314
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,320
Go to bed.

315
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:03,944
You coming with me?

316
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:07,236
You want to be careful what you're saying.

317
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:15,663
What have you done with my legs?

318
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:19,290
Come on.
Up to your room before Max gets back.

319
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:25,045
- Zena.
- Come on.

320
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:33,304
- What are you doing, Zena?
- I'm undoing your jacket.

321
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:49,741
You can put me down now, Zena.

322
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,097
Hello, Zena.

323
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,600
What are you doing in my bed?

324
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,812
- You may well ask.
- Yes.

325
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,807
Well, I am asking.

326
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:41,412
Does she kiss you like that?
I bet she doesn't.

327
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:46,003
Might as well make you comfortable.

328
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:48,580
- Zena.
- Hello.

329
00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:50,463
What's going on?

330
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:52,260
- Nothing.
- What happened?

331
00:39:52,345 --> 00:39:56,094
Three large schnapps.
That's what happened. He's not used to it.

332
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,721
You better help me get him into bed.

333
00:40:09,403 --> 00:40:10,945
Zena, don't...

334
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,324
Well, he's your boyfriend.

335
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:19,780
You tuck him up.

336
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:56,185
What are you doing in my bedroom?

337
00:40:57,865 --> 00:40:59,275
I feel sick.

338
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:03,028
- I think I'll have a glass of water.
- I'll get it.

339
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:14,917
That's better. Have some. It's delicious.

340
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:19,334
- I can't think why I drink anything else.
- Nor can I.

341
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,669
- I spoiled everything at dinner, didn't I?
- I'm afraid so, Paul.

342
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,300
It's because I always have to
go and tell the truth.

343
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:32,561
Why can't I make
a lot of polite conversation...

344
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:34,439
like everybody else?

345
00:41:35,984 --> 00:41:38,771
What do I have to take things
so seriously for?

346
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:41,353
Because you're you, I suppose.

347
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:43,857
Fat lot of good it does me.

348
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:46,149
That's why I love you, Paul.

349
00:41:48,746 --> 00:41:50,572
Do you love me, Maria?

350
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,949
In spite of everything?

351
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,751
Do you still love me?

352
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,254
I think you must...

353
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:09,258
otherwise you wouldn't be here like this...

354
00:42:10,016 --> 00:42:11,296
with me.

355
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:24,230
Zena, you still here?

356
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:27,440
- Is Paul back yet?
- He's upstairs studying.

357
00:42:28,116 --> 00:42:31,152
- He's a good boy. He'll go far.
- Not too far, I hope.

358
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:34,489
Well, I... What are you doing here?

359
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:37,244
I've locked up
and you've got a long way to go.

360
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,622
Do you want to stay the night
or something?

361
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,825
No, thanks.

362
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:44,917
I've had enough trouble with
all those students, without you as well.

363
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,759
Besides, a walk's good for my figure.

364
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:51,590
- Off you go, straight home.
- Good night.

365
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:05,145
Don't come with me.

366
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:06,777
- Are you sure?
- I'm quite sure.

367
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:09,353
- Shall I see you tonight?
- I'll try.

368
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:11,563
Goodbye.

369
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,902
You gave me a shock.
What are you doing here?

370
00:46:51,987 --> 00:46:53,612
I didn't go home last night.

371
00:46:53,697 --> 00:46:55,737
You've been here all night? But why?

372
00:46:55,824 --> 00:46:58,695
I just didn't feel like going home.
Do you want some coffee?

373
00:46:58,785 --> 00:47:01,490
- Hey, what's the matter...
- I'm all right!

374
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:05,329
Now do you want some coffee?

375
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,534
Yes, please.

376
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,152
Serve the priest, will you, Zena?

377
00:47:47,623 --> 00:47:51,371
You want something, Father?
Breakfast, hot rolls, chocolate?

378
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:55,246
I wondered if perhaps there was a room...

379
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:57,331
which I could rent for a few days?

380
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,583
- Sorry.
- We do have a room.

381
00:48:00,635 --> 00:48:02,544
The one next to Paul is empty.

382
00:48:03,763 --> 00:48:05,506
If I could have it.

383
00:48:06,891 --> 00:48:10,758
It's a very small room, Father.
You couldn't swing a cat in it...

384
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:12,679
and it's right at the top of the house.

385
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:16,721
I don't care what it's like or where it is.
If you'd be so kind.

386
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:21,862
You can have it for a few days.
Paul, show him up, will you?

387
00:48:22,155 --> 00:48:24,480
Do you have any baggage, Father?

388
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:28,360
- Just this.
- I'll take it.

389
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,280
You're very kind.

390
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,877
What's come over you?
I don't want a priest here.

391
00:48:44,968 --> 00:48:48,004
Is this your first visit
to Keinenberg, Father?

392
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:50,378
Yes.

393
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:54,139
I'm here on church business.

394
00:48:58,564 --> 00:49:01,269
Do you know the Monsignor
by any chance?

395
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:03,931
We have met. I know his niece better.

396
00:49:05,862 --> 00:49:07,191
His niece?

397
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:26,875
Paul, get me some more glasses. Please?

398
00:51:45,512 --> 00:51:47,136
- Paul!
- Coming.

399
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,257
Would you take over for me for a minute?
I don't feel very well.

400
00:51:52,351 --> 00:51:53,810
I said you didn't look well.

401
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:56,302
- Just for a while.
- Yes, of course.

402
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:50,483
What's the matter? What have I done?

403
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:53,783
- There is a girl.
- A girl? What girl?

404
00:52:54,034 --> 00:52:57,866
- The niece of the Monsignor.
- Maria?

405
00:52:58,538 --> 00:52:59,736
Bring her to me.

406
00:52:59,956 --> 00:53:02,661
What do you want her for? You've got me.

407
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:05,871
Bring her to me!

408
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:21,554
Hey, now, Paul.
Come on, that's not enough.

409
00:53:23,562 --> 00:53:25,104
Hello. You feeling better?

410
00:53:25,188 --> 00:53:28,058
Yes, I'm fine now.
You can go back to your studies.

411
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,607
Thanks. You sure you feel all right?

412
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:33,149
Yes. Back to your dreary old books.

413
00:53:34,155 --> 00:53:37,654
Paul, is Maria coming in tonight?

414
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:42,824
- I hope so, if she can get away.
- I'll call you when she comes.

415
00:53:43,163 --> 00:53:45,571
Thanks, Zena. You're a good sort.

416
00:53:56,092 --> 00:53:58,084
Some more beer, Zena. Hurry up.

417
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:01,589
I'm dying of thirst.

418
00:54:01,764 --> 00:54:03,507
I'll give you a hand, Zena.

419
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:07,010
- Zena, hurry up.
- Come back, Zena.

420
00:54:07,436 --> 00:54:08,764
We'll never get a drink now.

421
00:54:08,854 --> 00:54:10,977
- Hello, Zena.
- Hello, Maria.

422
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:13,637
- Where's Paul?
- He's downstairs in the bakery.

423
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:14,813
Thank you.

424
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:18,191
- Hello, Maria.
- Hello, Max.

425
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:20,106
Lovely girl, that.

426
00:54:33,418 --> 00:54:34,913
Paul, come on.

427
00:54:53,854 --> 00:54:54,885
No!

428
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:43,728
- What have you done with Maria, Paul?
- Maria?

429
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:44,932
She was looking for you.

430
00:55:45,027 --> 00:55:47,103
Stop messing about.
You know she's not here.

431
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:48,441
Where is she, Paul?

432
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,024
- Who?
- Maria.

433
00:55:50,115 --> 00:55:51,740
What have you done with her, Paul?

434
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:55,525
- Is she really here?
- Yeah, she went down there to find you.

435
00:56:31,404 --> 00:56:35,104
- Where's Maria, Paul?
- He can't find her.

436
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,693
She's not down there, Max.

437
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:41,030
You'd better go and try upstairs,
but I'm sure she went down to the bakery.

438
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:43,956
Sneaked her up to his room.
That's what he's done.

439
00:57:14,527 --> 00:57:16,436
Are you hurt? What happened?

440
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:19,863
- Don't leave me!
- I won't.

441
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,115
But how did you get here like this?

442
00:57:22,201 --> 00:57:25,487
I don't know.
I came to look for you, and then I...

443
00:57:26,163 --> 00:57:27,907
It's all right, darling.

444
00:57:34,046 --> 00:57:36,750
- You have failed me.
- But I...

445
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:41,794
- You must be punished.
- Forgive me.

446
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:45,679
I wasn't to know. I tried.

447
00:57:46,808 --> 00:57:49,559
But what do you want her for?
You've got me.

448
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:53,060
Well, you've got me!

449
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:21,380
Here, have a drink of this.
It will do you good.

450
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:23,837
- Now what was it?
- She went down there to find me...

451
00:58:23,926 --> 00:58:26,547
and the next thing she knew,
somebody had attacked her.

452
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:29,258
Something about a man with burning eyes
staring at her.

453
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:30,889
I saw him. I know I did.

454
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:34,556
No, love. It was in your mind.
You just thought you saw him, that's all.

455
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,514
She may have fainted.
Do you think she should go to bed?

456
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:39,016
Yes, come upstairs and rest.

457
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:43,186
No, I can't. I must go home.
Mother will be wondering where I am.

458
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:46,147
Just until you feel a little better, Maria.

459
00:58:48,115 --> 00:58:49,941
I can't understand it.

460
00:58:50,575 --> 00:58:52,117
Now come on up.

461
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:54,425
Destroy her.

462
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:08,533
It's all right, darling. There's nobody here.

463
01:01:15,127 --> 01:01:17,084
I must have been dreaming.

464
01:01:17,504 --> 01:01:19,212
Here, drink this.

465
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:21,714
Then I'll take you home.

466
01:01:22,467 --> 01:01:25,801
No, you can't. My mother will see.

467
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,460
But if you tell her what happened...

468
01:01:29,682 --> 01:01:31,390
No, how can I?

469
01:01:31,976 --> 01:01:34,681
I don't even know what happened myself.

470
01:01:37,231 --> 01:01:39,769
She'd be furious if she knew I'd come here.

471
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:41,353
I could explain.

472
01:01:41,443 --> 01:01:44,528
No, I don't suppose
that would help much either.

473
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,614
I'm all right, really.

474
01:02:07,718 --> 01:02:09,794
When shall I see you again?

475
01:02:10,637 --> 01:02:12,096
I don't know.

476
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,132
I'll try and come tomorrow.

477
01:02:18,061 --> 01:02:20,267
If not, I'll get a message to you.

478
01:02:20,647 --> 01:02:23,434
I'll come with you part of the way anyway.

479
01:03:21,495 --> 01:03:23,618
- Where have you been?
- Mother...

480
01:03:23,706 --> 01:03:25,248
You've been with Paul, haven't you?

481
01:03:25,332 --> 01:03:27,574
- I know it looks like...
- What does it look like?

482
01:03:27,668 --> 01:03:29,956
You should be ashamed of yourself.

483
01:03:36,634 --> 01:03:38,212
Maria, my darling.

484
01:03:41,514 --> 01:03:42,676
Ernst!

485
01:03:45,142 --> 01:03:47,349
Girls. Unreliable, the whole lot of them.

486
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,687
Come and go just as they please.
No sense of responsibility.

487
01:03:50,773 --> 01:03:53,690
That's what I like about you, Paul.
I can rely on you.

488
01:03:53,984 --> 01:03:55,775
That Zena hasn't turned up all day.

489
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:59,064
- Went off and never said she was going.
- She was here last night.

490
01:03:59,155 --> 01:04:01,231
Last night. I know all about last night.

491
01:04:01,324 --> 01:04:03,317
What's the matter with you today?

492
01:04:03,701 --> 01:04:05,824
Off with some student, I suppose.

493
01:04:06,162 --> 01:04:09,697
Come back again in about a fortnight
and want her job back.

494
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:14,621
Father.

495
01:04:15,045 --> 01:04:16,623
Will you do something for me?

496
01:04:17,172 --> 01:04:19,580
Will you go and find out how Maria is?

497
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,045
Go to her home?

498
01:04:21,134 --> 01:04:23,127
Yes, she lives with her uncle,
the Monsignor.

499
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,714
You must know him.

500
01:04:24,804 --> 01:04:28,505
Will you go and find out how she is
and give her this note?

501
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:32,392
- Very well.
- Thanks.

502
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:52,201
- I brought you some soup, Maria.
- Thank you, Uncle Ernst.

503
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:53,956
Sit up now.

504
01:04:59,003 --> 01:05:02,336
Drink it while it's... I've forgotten a spoon.

505
01:05:02,423 --> 01:05:04,665
It doesn't matter, Uncle Ernst.

506
01:05:05,592 --> 01:05:07,170
I'm not hungry.

507
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:13,178
Please forgive me.

508
01:05:13,475 --> 01:05:15,218
There, there.

509
01:05:19,147 --> 01:05:21,056
Do you love him, Maria?

510
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:25,108
- Yes, I do.
- Do you want to tell me about it?

511
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:27,643
Not now.

512
01:05:29,365 --> 01:05:31,653
All right. When you're ready.

513
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:34,869
Sleep now.

514
01:05:37,372 --> 01:05:39,080
God bless you, Maria.

515
01:08:20,566 --> 01:08:22,440
Father, what happened?

516
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:26,520
Maria. How is she? Is she well?
Did you give her the note?

517
01:08:27,031 --> 01:08:28,489
- Yes.
- And?

518
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:32,528
- And?
- She is well.

519
01:08:32,744 --> 01:08:36,279
- When can I see her?
- Not yet.

520
01:08:36,748 --> 01:08:39,286
Later she will come here to see you.

521
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:43,045
- When?
- As soon as she can.

522
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:47,836
- You are still working here, are you?
- Sorry, Max.

523
01:08:47,925 --> 01:08:49,206
Come on. I need you.

524
01:08:58,518 --> 01:09:00,594
She was lying here just like this.

525
01:09:00,812 --> 01:09:02,888
Not moving and scarcely breathing.

526
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:05,057
She's sick. She's very sick.

527
01:09:06,401 --> 01:09:08,939
- Was the window open?
- Yes.

528
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:13,232
Yes, it was open, just like this.
I didn't touch it.

529
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:16,368
You think she's caught a chill, is that it?

530
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:18,614
Possibly.

531
01:09:19,038 --> 01:09:21,908
The night air can be very treacherous
at this time of year.

532
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:25,083
- Possibly.
- Ernst, shouldn't we call the doctor?

533
01:09:27,254 --> 01:09:29,460
If she's not better tomorrow.

534
01:09:30,215 --> 01:09:31,757
Tomorrow, yes.

535
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:04,287
- How is she?
- Sleeping like a child.

536
01:10:05,456 --> 01:10:07,283
Did you close the window?

537
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:09,948
- Yes, but on such a warm night.
- Good.

538
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,631
Don't stay up too late, Ernst.

539
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:22,386
Good night, Anna.

540
01:12:35,388 --> 01:12:36,467
You.

541
01:13:02,205 --> 01:13:04,991
There, my love. Tell me, what is it?

542
01:13:05,374 --> 01:13:08,161
Maria, tell me what happened. What is it?

543
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,414
Anna, help me!

544
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:17,252
Oh, dear God!

545
01:13:17,844 --> 01:13:20,086
Here, lean on me.

546
01:13:34,068 --> 01:13:35,478
You must go.

547
01:13:36,862 --> 01:13:38,736
You must get him to come here.

548
01:13:38,822 --> 01:13:40,898
- You should rest.
- No, Anna.

549
01:13:41,533 --> 01:13:42,992
Listen to me.

550
01:13:44,244 --> 01:13:46,236
You must fetch that boy.

551
01:13:46,496 --> 01:13:49,580
- The one who was here.
- Paul?

552
01:13:52,001 --> 01:13:55,085
- Bring him here to me.
- Why Paul?

553
01:13:56,213 --> 01:13:59,748
Because he loves her. He will help her.

554
01:14:02,844 --> 01:14:06,379
- I'll go now, Ernst.
- No. Anna.

555
01:14:09,517 --> 01:14:13,515
Perhaps it is better you do not go
until daylight.

556
01:14:25,532 --> 01:14:29,233
Count Dracula is alive.

557
01:14:31,496 --> 01:14:33,785
During the hours of darkness...

558
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:37,247
she must never be left alone.

559
01:14:37,794 --> 01:14:39,537
You understand that?

560
01:14:41,589 --> 01:14:44,590
Not for one moment
must you leave her side.

561
01:14:46,427 --> 01:14:48,799
Protect yourself as best you can.

562
01:14:49,263 --> 01:14:53,556
There are devices
which may be of some effect:

563
01:14:54,518 --> 01:14:56,557
Charms, herbs.

564
01:14:57,062 --> 01:14:59,101
You will find it all here.

565
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:03,686
You are a scholar of sorts, I understand.

566
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:07,277
- Well, I...
- They are all in Latin.

567
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:11,949
Do the best you can. What little time...

568
01:15:14,662 --> 01:15:17,283
- I'll get a doctor.
- No time.

569
01:15:18,665 --> 01:15:22,164
You must swear
to do what I have told you.

570
01:15:22,836 --> 01:15:27,213
- I promise.
- You should swear by almighty God...

571
01:15:28,716 --> 01:15:31,172
but you have denied yourself this.

572
01:15:40,352 --> 01:15:42,012
You have my word.

573
01:15:44,189 --> 01:15:45,683
I know I have.

574
01:15:46,525 --> 01:15:47,900
Thank you.

575
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,071
Anna, the boy must stay here.

576
01:15:53,573 --> 01:15:56,242
Yes, of course. Hurry. Get your things.

577
01:15:58,035 --> 01:15:59,695
Come back quickly.

578
01:16:00,621 --> 01:16:04,286
There is much to do before dark.

579
01:16:12,883 --> 01:16:15,456
- What on earth are you doing?
- Keep my job open for me.

580
01:16:15,552 --> 01:16:17,379
I'll explain later.

581
01:16:17,595 --> 01:16:19,754
Father, I need your help. Hurry up.

582
01:16:19,848 --> 01:16:22,303
Come with me, please. Please hurry.

583
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:24,684
What happened?

584
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,471
"The flowers of garlic should be placed...

585
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:19,017
"on either side of the head
of the one to be protected.

586
01:17:19,653 --> 01:17:22,856
"No more than a hand's breadth
away from the throat.

587
01:17:23,449 --> 01:17:25,904
"The oil from the clove of garlic...

588
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:30,199
"should be smeared around the edges
of any aperture in the wall...

589
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:32,330
"doors and windows...

590
01:17:32,999 --> 01:17:36,333
"lest the vampire try to gain ingress."

591
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,466
He meant to give it to her for her birthday.

592
01:17:51,516 --> 01:17:53,924
<i>It's all right, Frau Muller. You go and rest.</i>

593
01:17:54,019 --> 01:17:56,806
I promise you, I'll call you if I need you.

594
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:38,305
Why don't you go and rest, Father?

595
01:18:39,728 --> 01:18:40,807
No.

596
01:18:42,147 --> 01:18:45,314
Yes. You go and lie down. I can manage.

597
01:19:57,009 --> 01:19:59,167
I can't!

598
01:20:00,178 --> 01:20:02,503
What are you trying to do?

599
01:20:03,306 --> 01:20:05,299
- He told me to do it.
- He who?

600
01:20:05,392 --> 01:20:08,227
- Who told you?
- Dracula.

601
01:20:10,688 --> 01:20:13,974
How could he tell you? You, a priest?

602
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:17,854
- Where is he?
- He willed me to do it.

603
01:20:18,195 --> 01:20:20,022
I cannot disobey him.

604
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:25,237
Now I'm willing you. Do you understand?

605
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:32,959
- First you'll tell me where he is.
- No, I can't.

606
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:35,580
- Second, you'll take me to him.
- No.

607
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:38,339
You will take me to him, now!

608
01:20:57,482 --> 01:20:59,474
Quickly, before he wakes.

609
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:02,277
Quickly.

610
01:21:04,405 --> 01:21:06,029
You must do it now!

611
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:25,206
Pray! You must pray!

612
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,837
- I can't!
- You must.

613
01:21:27,927 --> 01:21:31,426
- You must, or he won't die.
- You pray! You're a priest!

614
01:21:36,352 --> 01:21:37,810
He won't die!

615
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:40,889
He isn't going to die!

616
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:47,456
Maria, get away from here!

617
01:23:11,732 --> 01:23:15,646
Now my revenge is complete.

618
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:32,372
- What's the matter, lad?
- Max.

619
01:23:34,087 --> 01:23:35,367
It's Maria.

620
01:24:36,812 --> 01:24:39,729
Good evening. It isn't often
we see strangers in these parts.

621
01:24:39,815 --> 01:24:42,306
There's a castle
somewhere in the mountains here...

622
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,607
belonging to a Count Dracula.

623
01:24:46,571 --> 01:24:48,398
- Do you know him?
- We know who you mean.

624
01:24:48,489 --> 01:24:49,818
I have to go there.

625
01:24:49,907 --> 01:24:53,857
- Why? It's empty. There's no one there.
- Not for long. He's on his way here.

626
01:24:53,953 --> 01:24:57,286
- Dracula? Impossible.
- It's true. I swear it.

627
01:24:57,373 --> 01:25:00,208
- He's dead. He died months ago.
- No, he's alive.

628
01:25:00,292 --> 01:25:03,044
- He's alive, and he's coming here.
- Then you brought him.

629
01:25:03,128 --> 01:25:05,500
Why can't you leave us alone?
Why must you meddle?

630
01:25:05,589 --> 01:25:07,961
- Please listen to me.
- Quiet!

631
01:25:24,481 --> 01:25:25,810
Let me by!

632
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:28,605
- I must get by!
- Be silent!

633
01:25:29,403 --> 01:25:30,897
Please, I have to follow.

634
01:25:30,987 --> 01:25:34,439
If you take my advice, you'll go
straight back to where you came from.

635
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:36,948
Will someone show me the way
to the castle?

636
01:25:37,035 --> 01:25:40,617
You won't get anyone to go up there
with you, son. Not even in daylight.

637
01:25:40,705 --> 01:25:43,410
Will someone just show me the way then?

638
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:47,251
Surely one of you
has got the courage to do that.

639
01:25:50,089 --> 01:25:52,758
- Come on then.
- You're not going anywhere!

640
01:25:52,841 --> 01:25:55,546
We're sick of people
interfering with our lives.

641
01:25:55,886 --> 01:25:59,468
And if we leave things alone,
then maybe he'll leave us alone.

642
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:03,431
But he's evil, and while he's alive,
none of you will be safe.

643
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:06,602
Take him upstairs and lock him up
until he cools off.

644
01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:18,320
No, let him go.

645
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,069
He'll be sorry.

646
01:28:10,512 --> 01:28:12,837
Get that thing out of my sight.

647
01:28:14,932 --> 01:28:16,343
Throw it away!

648
01:28:50,132 --> 01:28:51,792
Maria!

649
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,675
Amen.
