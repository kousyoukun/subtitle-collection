He honestly doesn't seem
to like you, Finstock.

20
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:15,800
He loves me. Do you know why?

21
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:20,555
He loves me, because I'm his master.

22
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:23,104
He knows I will protect him.

23
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,980
Like the students here
at Hamilton University. Sit!

24
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,613
They know why I'm here.

25
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:35,158
Finstock, do you know why you're here?

26
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,999
Yes, sir. 32.500 a year and summers off.

27
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,282
You're here because it's time to bring
the glory back to this institution.

28
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:46,131
The regional boxing finals
are in three months.

29
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:50,544
Now, you and I have a sacred oath

30
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,552
to provide these young people
with an opportunity

31
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:58,133
To develop not only their minds,
but their spirit as well.

32
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:02,472
Their fighting spirit. Am I right?

33
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,857
I promised the alumni
a winning boxing team

34
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,812
and all you've given me
is this Todd Howard.

35
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:14,115
All he ever did on the field
was play in the school band.

36
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:15,907
Clarinet, looks like.

37
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,156
Can I make a sudden move?

38
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:30,037
That's the kid. His cousin Scott played
basketball for me at Beacontown High.

39
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:31,672
- And?
- And what?

40
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,082
"And what? And what?" What?!

41
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,715
I don't think Scott knew the first thing
about playing the clarinet.

42
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,473
I gave that kid a full scholarship
based on your recommendation.

43
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:46,135
On my recommendation? That's great.

44
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:49,397
- Finstock!
- What?

45
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:52,519
Your job is riding on this boxing team.

46
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,267
And so is my reputation as an educator.

47
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:05,159
And all you brought me
is a clarinet player?

48
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,285
- I think it's that way.
- Ok. Three blocks?

49
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,209
Todd! Todd!

50
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,252
- Thanks a lot.
- Bye.

51
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,292
- Come on, Todd. Let's go.
- Excuse me.

52
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:24,045
She said the dorm was past the quad
and left after the administration building.

53
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,888
- Or was it right?
- We'll just keep going straight.

54
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,981
I know how you feel.

55
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,688
College is a stressful time.
Especially on your first day.

56
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:47,110
I mean, it's stressful for anyone.

57
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:51,118
Even for people without
your particular worry.

58
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,413
- What worry?
- You know.

59
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,589
I don't believe it.

60
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,676
Wow!

61
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:08,134
Absolutely, I mean...

62
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:10,381
I hate it when you do that.

63
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:14,508
I'm not ashamed of what I am
and you shouldn't be either.

64
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:18,020
I'm not, because it skipped my family.

65
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:23,898
No, I've got enough problems.
I'm here at a new school.

66
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:29,859
I gotta make new friends and try
to fit in without this hanging over me.

67
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:39,040
It is true that sometimes
it skips family members.

68
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,329
Your mother and father aren't werewolves.

69
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:47,380
But if I were you,
I'd keep my possibilities open.

70
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:57,717
Uncle Harold, can you please
change back before we get to the dorm?

71
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:00,385
Thanks.

72
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,234
I think the dorm is a
little north from here.

73
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:08,774
Watch out!

74
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:14,942
Phew!

75
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,621
Excuse me, I think that this was our space.

76
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:26,041
- Are you talking to me?
- No, but...

77
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,628
...I'd like to maybe give you a call.

78
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,764
- Gus, he says this is his space.
- A freshman.

79
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:47,263
Did you think I said that this was
my space? I didn't say that. No.

80
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:51,141
This is your space.
My space has yellow lines on it.

81
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,862
I brought my uncle by to see your space,
because it's so nice.

82
00:07:56,033 --> 00:08:00,943
And now since you're in your space,
we'll get in ours.

83
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:10,460
- They seem like nice kids.
- I saw another space up the street.

84
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:30,265
Todd? Buddy, how are you? Come on in.

85
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,773
Drop your stuff off. Make yourself at home.

86
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:40,028
- Do I... know you?
- Stiles. We're roommates.

87
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:43,733
- Stiles?
- Mr. H?

88
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,445
- Stiles!
- Mr. H! How's the prince of paint?

89
00:08:47,623 --> 00:08:52,450
- What are you doing here?
- Connections. Daughter of somebody.

90
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:54,784
Let me just tidy up a bit.

91
00:08:57,464 --> 00:09:01,415
It's a great room, huh?
I decorated it myself.

92
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:05,756
Well, what do you think?
You're in the big time, kid. College.

93
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,173
No one telling you what to do.
No more picking up your stuff. No parents.

94
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,602
No offense, Mr. H. Let
me help you with that.

95
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,772
- Todd?
- Yeah?

96
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,735
- Will you walk me to the van?
- Sure.

97
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:30,159
Everything is kosher.
I've taken care of everything.

98
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:33,827
I've got Todd's year at
college all mapped out.

99
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,750
For the drive home.

100
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,082
Todd?

101
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,881
Thanks. You got any fries?

102
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,634
- See you in a bit.
- We are gonna have a great year.

103
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:53,055
- I think so.
- I've got them vibes happening.

104
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,885
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

105
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:57,182
In a big way.

106
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,690
- Hey.
- Todd, I...

107
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:05,274
Listen, Uncle Harold,
everything's gonna be fine.

108
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:08,861
Once I start those science classes,
I'll really like it here.

109
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:11,273
But what about that sports scholarship?

110
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,196
The closest you ever came to an athletic field
was playing clarinet in the marching band.

111
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:20,072
Once they take a look at me,
they won't want me on any team.

112
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:22,326
They ain't gonna give you
something for nothing.

113
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:25,420
Well, I guess that's their problem.

114
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:30,257
- Don't forget your groceries.
- Oh yeah, thanks.

115
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:35,466
I promised your mum and dad
to look after you.

116
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,676
I didn't expect
to find Stiles as your roommate.

117
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,556
He seems Ok.

118
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:47,268
Stiles was Scott's best friend
in high school. He knows all about us.

119
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:50,194
Well, I figure since I'm not a...

120
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:57,484
Since I don't have the family problem,
there's nothing to worry about.

121
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:59,985
I'm sure you'll be Ok. Hey, listen...

122
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:03,912
- What are you doing?
- Take this. You never know.

123
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:11,037
- Well, take care.
- Yeah.

124
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:13,752
What?

125
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:18,088
- If you need anything, you call me.
- I will.

126
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:22,640
- Ok.
- Thanks, Uncle Harold. Take it easy.

127
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:26,518
Call me.

128
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,899
All right, all right.
I'll see you later.

129
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,744
<i>En garde!</i>

130
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,709
No mercy!

131
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,123
Ha, ha, ha!

132
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,130
Hey! Take it easy.

133
00:11:58,302 --> 00:11:59,795
Die!

134
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,752
- He's nuts!
- Sorry.

135
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,552
Chocolate milk.

136
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,271
Grab the door for me?

137
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:18,193
- Todd, Chubby. Chub, Todd.
- Hi.

138
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,982
Chub played basketball
at Beacontown, Todd.

139
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:23,481
- So you know my cousin?
- Scott.

140
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:28,154
- We just love the Howard family.
- Stiles, where is all my stuff?

141
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:40,169
Some of my T-shirts are in there,
but help yourself. I don't mind.

142
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,460
What did you mean when you said
you've taken care of everything?

143
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:49,343
All your classes. I registered for you.

144
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:53,602
You what? I've already pre-registered.

145
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,597
I know. I saw what you picked.
I made the necessary changes. Trust me.

146
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:03,775
- This is all wrong. Girls' volleyball?
- Good class.

147
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:06,402
Candle making? French for chefs?

148
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:10,192
<i>C'est très magnifique.</i>
It's a good class. I'm taking it again.

149
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:16,321
- There's not one science class on here.
- Science?

150
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,575
You don't understand.

151
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,338
That boy's got werewolf
written all over him.

152
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:29,967
If everything goes as planned, he and
I are gonna take the school by storm.

153
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:33,802
I love college. I love it.

154
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,098
- I gotta get these changed.
- Don't make me laugh, kid.

155
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:46,109
Rules are rules. Policy is policy.

156
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:50,191
- This has got to be changed.
- You've got a lot of nerve.

157
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,365
Nobody ever changes their classes.

158
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,378
What do you want?

159
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:20,548
- I...
- Well? Well?

160
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,845
Come on, I haven't got all day.

161
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,848
I'd like... to change... some classes.

162
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:46,781
Have your professor sign this
and bring it back here. But not to me.

163
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,411
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

164
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:55,372
It's not as tough as it looks.

165
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:09,678
- I'm looking for Professor Brooks.
- She's not in there.

166
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:18,018
I was wondering if you could tell me
where she might be?

167
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:22,063
Professor Brooks is
both omnivorous and bipedal.

168
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:26,655
She's also a <i>homo sapiens femininus.</i>

169
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,784
And a brilliant one at that.

170
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:47,512
- I'm Tanya Brooks. Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Todd... Howard.

171
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:52,593
- Howard, yes. I know all about you.
- You do?

172
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,687
I'm your faculty advisor.
I read your application.

173
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:58,394
Your talent for science
is very impressive.

174
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:02,103
I was surprised that you're here
on an athletic scholarship.

175
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,784
Surprised me too.
I have a favor to ask you.

176
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:10,739
I wanna be a veterinarian
and I need your class.

177
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:15,242
I know registration is over,
but could you see it my way?

178
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:19,165
- Yes?
- You're in my class. It's not full yet.

179
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:23,121
- As your advisor, I'll make an exception.
- Really? Thank you.

180
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:28,919
Thank you very much.

181
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,062
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking for <i>lubrus protozoa. </i>.

182
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,942
Let's see.

183
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,569
Here it is, right here.

184
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,991
There's nothing on this.

185
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:07,172
It sort of helps if you turn it on.

186
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:12,003
See you.

187
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:29,563
- I need to speak to a coach.
- You're Todd Howard.

188
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:32,773
- Yeah.
- We're all depending on you.

189
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:37,858
- Depending on me for what?
- Hey, you missed a spot.

190
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:43,278
I had a kid once who had
an athletic scholarship just like you.

191
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,865
A gifted athlete.

192
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:50,337
But he had this crazy dream
about wanting to become a chiropractor.

193
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:53,956
But he had to work all night at this diner.

194
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:58,842
Because he was supporting his sister
and she had three kids.

195
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:04,090
- And his name was Philip. No wait.
- Doesn't matter.

196
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:07,139
It sorta does. His name was George.

197
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:10,148
Her three kids were really nice,

198
00:18:10,316 --> 00:18:13,436
but one had two thumbs on his right hand.

199
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,613
So did he become a chiropractor?

200
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:20,817
Not with two thumbs
on his right hand, he didn't.

201
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,917
Wait a minute.
You're from Beacontown, aren't you?

202
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,080
Yeah.

203
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:39,005
Now I get it. You think that I'm...

204
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,767
You can forget it. I'm not Scott.
I can't do what Scott did.

205
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,555
What's a five-letter word
for "Italian sausage"?

206
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,848
So that's why they gave me
a sports scholarship.

207
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:58,313
So what? Go a few rounds in the ring,
get your head knocked off. Maybe.

208
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:00,859
You get your scholarship
and everybody's happy.

209
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:05,324
- Jump into what ring?
- Just show up for practice this Thursday.

210
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,948
- Practice for what?
- Boxing.

211
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:12,113
"Frank". That's perfect.

212
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,461
Would you take it easy?

213
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:28,388
I wanna keep this scholarship
and I don't know what I'm doing.

214
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:31,095
Fat kid's a great dancer.

215
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:34,681
All right.

216
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:38,393
Ok, you wanna play rough?

217
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:41,138
I'll throw two jabs.
Come back with a right.

218
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,328
- Which one's the Howard kid?
- Hey, Todd.

219
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:06,496
I guess he's a little rusty.

220
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:27,982
If this is some kind of joke,
you'll notice I'm not laughing.

221
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:02,475
- I had dibs on this.
- Possession is nine tenths of the law.

222
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:05,395
So now you're a lawyer?
Thought you were a biologist.

223
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:10,356
What do you want with it anyway?
It's probably over your head.

224
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,394
- Over my head?
- Over any jock's head.

225
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,114
Jock?

226
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:24,575
Listen, I just wanna go to this school,
but I'm here on a sports scholarship

227
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:27,702
with a coach who wants me
to have two right thumbs.

228
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:32,372
My roommate sunbathes with a light bulb,
some fat kid eats all my food.

229
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:35,632
I've got Dean Dunn's dog
trying to bite my leg off.

230
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,800
- And you want the only book that I want?
- Shh!

231
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:46,303
Well, I'll tell you what. You can have
this book and this book and this book.

232
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:48,434
- And keep that book as well.
- Shh!

233
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:50,015
You too, buddy.

234
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:29,301
- You Ok?
- Yeah.

235
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:35,063
- Here. You want this more than I do.
- Thanks.

236
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:41,026
I... I guess I got a little
carried away in there.

237
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,403
I guess you did.

238
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,121
Hey, wait up.

239
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:07,551
"Phylum and Genus Classes
in North American Crustaceans"?

240
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,759
Little light reading for you, huh?

241
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,099
I should have known
that I'd find you in the science section.

242
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:24,184
I probably won't be needing
this book anyway.

243
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,613
I was science fair champion...
...in the tri-county area.

244
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,488
My research is
in crustacean reproduction.

245
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:35,489
How exciting.

246
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:18,322
- How's your schedule?
- It's better.

247
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:21,068
Listen, Nicki...

248
00:24:22,165 --> 00:24:26,032
...I was wondering if, well...

249
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,370
- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.

250
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:33,588
- You would?
- Sure.

251
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,218
Great.

252
00:24:37,596 --> 00:24:40,680
I'm busy Friday, but Saturday I'm free.

253
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:45,849
Do lab partners work on the weekends
this early in the semester?

254
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:50,139
Oh...

255
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:57,397
- I thought you were asking me if...
- Really? Oh...

256
00:24:57,573 --> 00:25:03,528
Well, then you mean you'd like to?
I mean, maybe...

257
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,111
Maybe we can.

258
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:22,752
Hi.

259
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,180
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye.

260
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,569
- Hi.
- Hi.

261
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:44,572
- About earlier...
- Don't worry. It's nothing.

262
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,663
- Thanks. You look nice.
- Thank you.

263
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,750
- You wanna dance?
- Sure.

264
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,620
- How's that left hook?
- It's great.

265
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:06,551
Todd Howard, I'd like you to meet
Mrs. St. Claire, one of our benefactors.

266
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:12,723
The new physics lab, Lennock field
and other endowments.

267
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:14,304
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

268
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:19,852
I'd like you also to meet
Lisa Goldfluss and Emily Lord.

269
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:23,145
They are co-hostesses
of our reception committee.

270
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,608
We've met.

271
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,985
This fine young man carries
our hopes and dreams into the ring.

272
00:26:32,162 --> 00:26:34,284
Lisa, dance with Todd.

273
00:26:34,455 --> 00:26:37,410
- Dean Dunn, I really...
- Do it.

274
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:47,335
What are you smiling at? You're next.

275
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:49,418
How's your boyfriend?

276
00:26:49,595 --> 00:26:55,265
I may have to dance with you,
but I don't have to talk to you.

277
00:27:56,824 --> 00:27:58,532
Hey.

278
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:28,683
- You sure do sweat a lot.
- Shut up and dance.

279
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:08,928
Oh no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

280
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,403
Oh my... You're a dog.
I've been dancing with a dog.

281
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:27,736
- Yeah, I knew you had it in you.
- Hey, look out!

282
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,323
Dip!

283
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:44,210
Let me give you a hand with that.

284
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:51,171
Miss Goldfluss, do you
have an explanation for this?

285
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,760
- What are you so upset about?
- Upset, Stiles? Me, upset?

286
00:29:58,938 --> 00:30:01,429
I had a beard all over my body.

287
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:05,439
Fingernails the size of French fries.
Teeth from here to Texas.

288
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:08,364
And she called me a dog. A dog!

289
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:11,781
Ok, I might be able to cut you a deal.

290
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:16,198
If they let you keep the scholarship,
you become the school mascot.

291
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:19,538
- Yeah?
- This is just the tip of the iceberg.

292
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,784
Everybody will be talking about you.

293
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,625
All you gotta do is be the wolf, Todd.
I'll do the rest.

294
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:31,383
Wonderful. Wonderful.
She called me a dog.

295
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:37,467
The bed they laid him in
was only six feet long.

296
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:43,097
His feet hung over the end.

297
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:48,265
Mary, his wife, clung to his side.

298
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:53,105
Her tears mingled with his blood.

299
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:58,441
Her prayers echoed the grief
of an entire nation.

300
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:04,324
The small projectile from the derringer
that John Wilkes Booth used

301
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:08,119
- was lodged in his left temple.
- I've got fleas. You distract him.

302
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:15,128
And all night long the vigil waited
in that small boarding house

303
00:31:15,302 --> 00:31:20,011
across from Ford's Theatre
until the wee hours in the morning.

304
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,427
When fate dealt that final blow...

305
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:31,397
...a crowd of mourners gathered,

306
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:37,605
white, black, rich and poor.

307
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:44,318
And so, ten hours after that fatal shot,
President Abraham Lincoln...

308
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:48,279
Mr. Howard, where are you going?
Mr. Howard.

309
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,368
Ah! Ah! Ah!

310
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:58,255
Todd Howard. I've been wanting
to speak with you, young man.

311
00:31:58,426 --> 00:32:02,091
Your disruptive behavior
at yesterday's reception

312
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:05,263
warrants my personal attention,
don't you think?

313
00:32:05,432 --> 00:32:11,222
I don't like practical jokes.
I am not a funny man.

314
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:15,476
I fail to see the humor
of dressing up in a dog costume

315
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,355
- and trying to frighten our alumni.
- But Dean Dunn...

316
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:21,860
Don't give me any of that backtalk.

317
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:24,949
If you're trying to push me...

318
00:32:25,118 --> 00:32:27,905
...you have no idea who
you're dealing with.

319
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,872
Your first fight is coming up.
So far I'm unimpressed.

320
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:42,665
You'd better not fail
me, because if you do,

321
00:32:42,842 --> 00:32:46,971
I'll call every dean at every school

322
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:50,839
and you'll never go to
college, anywhere, ever.

323
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:54,432
Do I make myself crystal clear?

324
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:56,768
Oh!

325
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:02,895
Strange boy.

326
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:08,565
Excuse me.

327
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:13,489
The guy that turned
into a dog, what's his problem?

328
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:16,153
He's really weird.

329
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:19,002
Everybody's scratching around here.

330
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:26,712
Todd, we're looking forward
to your presentation. Are you ready?

331
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,501
Yeah, I think so.

332
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:42,221
Todd, I wanna see you.
That's all for today. Thank you.

333
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:48,737
- Do you wanna go to lunch?
- You don't wanna be seen with a dog.

334
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:53,780
- Do you wanna go to lunch, or not?
- I've gotta go see the professor.

335
00:33:56,746 --> 00:34:01,372
They're giving you
a hard time, aren't they?

336
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:05,455
- I'm your advisor. Maybe I can help.
- I don't think so.

337
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:10,373
Well, I'd like to try. You have a talent
for science. Let's start with that.

338
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,879
No matter what anyone says or does,
don't lose sight of your goals.

339
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,841
I wanted to study hard
and become a veterinarian.

340
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:22,392
I can help you with that.
You're a very bright young man, Todd.

341
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,515
You'll find a way to deal
with your other problems.

342
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,846
If you only knew, Professor Brooks.

343
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,568
I'll do my very best to try and understand.

344
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:38,151
- I'm always here if you need me.
- Ok.

345
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:01,967
Hope you're hungry.
I've got a ton of stuff here.

346
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:07,759
- You like chicken, don't you?
- Why are you doing this?

347
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:10,095
'Cause I'm hungry.

348
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:17,560
- Drumstick?
- You know what I mean.

349
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:23,027
Biologically speaking it's absolutely
fascinating what's happened to you.

350
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,654
If you think I'm gonna
feel sorry for you, forget it.

351
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:31,452
But I'm a dog.

352
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:34,910
You'll be Ok. You will.

353
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:20,663
One, two, three. You're out of here.
Bring the doctor in here.

354
00:36:31,348 --> 00:36:36,473
- How many does that make?
- Three for them. None for us.

355
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:39,431
You're up next, big guy.

356
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:43,853
- But coach, this isn't my weight class.
- That'll be my problem. Go on.

357
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,609
Hey, what if I...?

358
00:36:52,702 --> 00:36:58,408
- He outweighs my guy by 50 pounds.
- It's all water weight, look at him.

359
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:14,171
Look tough, Chubby.

360
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,633
Let's box.

361
00:37:16,808 --> 00:37:19,215
Hey, what are you doing?

362
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:21,766
- Put him down.
- Put him down.

363
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:24,642
- Put me down.
- I'm warning you.

364
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:27,932
All right. Let's box.

365
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:31,479
- You pig.
- Come on.

366
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:35,783
- Come on.
- No more. Let's box.

367
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:38,279
Use your weight, Chub.

368
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:45,328
Ok. Break. Break.

369
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:09,892
Get over there.

370
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:15,605
Hamilton!

371
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:26,449
That's the last fight you win.

372
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:33,953
All right, Chubby.

373
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:48,468
All right. Let's take him.
Get out there, babe.

374
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,529
Ok, get in there.

375
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,491
Ok, let's box!

376
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:57,454
Next.

377
00:39:59,002 --> 00:40:00,828
Next.

378
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,752
Don't worry. There's a
good hospital on campus.

379
00:40:05,924 --> 00:40:09,506
Let's get this over with.
I've got a date in a half hour.

380

Let's go, big blue, let's go

381
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:28,483
This makes or breaks your career.

382
00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:33,315
Let's go, Pug.

383
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:39,193
- You're gonna die.
- I know.

384
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:52,666
Move, move, move!

385
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:55,886
Knock him out!

386
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:00,172
Great move.

387
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:04,264
I'll break your kneecaps
if you don't keep still and let me hit you.

388
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:14,987
Come on, Pug.

389
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,001
- All right.
- Yeah!

390
00:41:34,174 --> 00:41:36,664
All right. Get back. Come on.

391
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:38,800
You're history.

392
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,176
I knew Pug would win that fight.

393
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:48,720
- You Ok, kid? One...
- Todd, get up. Come on.

394
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:50,687
Don't lie there like a fish.

395

Yeah!

400
00:42:28,434 --> 00:42:31,849
- What is this?
- It's that dog you were dancing with.

401
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:36,681
- Do you wanna stop the fight?
- Hell no. Go on.

402
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:48,565
All right. Box.

403
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:51,701
Stay away from him, Pug.

404
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:56,198
Nail him, Todd. Nail him.

405
00:43:10,138 --> 00:43:12,131
Pug, come on!

406

Get in there and kill him!

407
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:27,318

have a party and have so much fun.

00:51:34,486 --> 00:51:37,820
Every dog has his day. And his is mine.

468
00:54:05,962 --> 00:54:07,373
Hello?

469
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:13,881
- Emily.
- Stiles.

470
00:54:14,053 --> 00:54:17,338
- Go away.
- What?

471
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:19,590
You don't mind, do you, buddy?

472
00:54:21,018 --> 00:54:23,176
Lisa...

473
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:26,438
- Hey, Todd.
- Stiles, beat it.

474
00:54:26,607 --> 00:54:28,314
Chubby.

475
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:33,611
Chubby? Chub?

476
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,446
Chubby?

477
00:54:49,837 --> 00:54:54,795
- Chubby.
- What?

478
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,214
I've created a monster.

479
00:55:00,888 --> 00:55:02,680
Mmm...

480
00:55:07,979 --> 00:55:09,887
Hmm?

481
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:14,307
That smell is disgusting.

482
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:30,371
Ok, so I was absent
the day you guys did this.

483
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,920
- Are you mad at me?
- Ha!

484
00:55:37,089 --> 00:55:39,247
- You're jealous.
- What?

485
00:55:39,424 --> 00:55:44,549
Of those two leeches you hang around with?
You can't even see it, can you?

486
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:46,845
They don't like you, only the wolf.

487
00:55:47,015 --> 00:55:51,227
Look, just because everything
is going great for me

488
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:54,430
doesn't give you the right
to go off and start...

489
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:02,859
- You just hit me with a dead frog.
- Jerk.

490
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:04,571
Jerk?

491
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,125
Frog fight!

492
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:27,673
Incoming!

493
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:44,603
What is going on here?
Frog fighting in my lab?

494
00:56:44,778 --> 00:56:47,019
Put those things away.

495
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,825
That's the end of class for today.

496
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,032
Except for you.

497
00:56:54,204 --> 00:56:56,326
I wanna talk to you.

498
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:19,383
I've been talking with
your other professors.

499
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:24,352
I know about the car, your grades
and how you're coasting through.

500
00:57:24,523 --> 00:57:30,692
When you have a gift,
you have a responsibility to use it wisely.

501
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:34,860
You're not. And you're
only letting yourself down.

502
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:41,614
- Are you in a hurry?
- Actually, I have to get to practice.

503
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:43,331
Team's nothing without the wolf.

504
00:57:43,499 --> 00:57:47,367
You can't expect the wolf
to solve all your problems.

505
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:50,629
You do realize
you have finals coming up, don't you?

506
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,459
- Yeah, regional finals?
- No, course finals.

507
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:03,847
Listen, I don't think I need this class.

508
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:06,592
You told me to choose the right path.

509
00:58:06,771 --> 00:58:10,270
And with the road that I've chosen...

510
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:12,767
...I don't think I need biology at all.

511
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:19,730
I'm very sorry to hear that.

512
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:32,951
You waited for me?

513
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:38,004
I don't know why.

514
00:58:40,969 --> 00:58:43,377
I never thought I'd say it,

515
00:58:43,555 --> 00:58:45,762
but I miss the old Todd.

516
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,135
What happened?

517
00:58:50,395 --> 00:58:53,728
- He turned into a werewolf.
- But that's not the real you.

518
00:58:53,898 --> 00:58:58,442
The wolf lets me do what I wanna do.
It's a gift.

519
00:58:58,611 --> 00:59:01,447
- I have a responsibility to myself...
- Responsibility?

520
00:59:01,614 --> 00:59:06,690
What about school? Or being a veterinarian?
What about you and me?

521
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:13,994
My feelings for you are real.
They have nothing to do with the wolf.

522
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:17,334
Those others could care
less about the real you.

523
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:20,375
Look, I'm late and you're wrong.

524
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:35,259
That's the way it's done, girls.

525
00:59:40,984 --> 00:59:42,360
Watch this.

526
00:59:55,206 --> 00:59:57,697
We'll play through.

527
01:00:01,462 --> 01:00:05,293
How can you take him seriously?
He's a freshman.

528
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:08,798
With an awful lot of hair.

529
01:00:13,307 --> 01:00:16,260
Why don't you shut your mouth?

530
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:19,720
- Let's settle this man to man.
- I don't fight chipmunks.

531
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:22,018
Not here, Gus.

532
01:00:33,116 --> 01:00:35,275
What are you doing?

533
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:42,707
Where are you going?

534
01:00:44,878 --> 01:00:47,795
You die in the ring, pal.

535
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:01,802
Fore!

536
01:01:03,646 --> 01:01:05,388
It's in the hole.

537
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:22,450
You guys studying?

538
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:28,374
Yes, some of us
actually have to take finals.

539
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:35,087
Mr. Stilinsky...

540
01:01:36,218 --> 01:01:40,297
...what say you, me and the wolf

541
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:42,879
take the wheels for a little...

542
01:01:45,727 --> 01:01:47,220
...spin?

543
01:01:47,394 --> 01:01:49,802
- Nope.
- Huh, huh?

544
01:01:56,403 --> 01:02:00,151
How about you, big guy?
I might even let you drive.

545
01:02:00,323 --> 01:02:02,281
What do you say?

546
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:06,025
I'm busy. Ok?

547
01:02:07,913 --> 01:02:10,999
- See you, Stiles.
- See you, Chub.

548
01:02:15,964 --> 01:02:20,589
- Check 46.
- You know what's funny?

549
01:02:20,759 --> 01:02:24,128
I wanted you to become the wolf
more than anybody else.

550
01:02:24,305 --> 01:02:27,887
So I guess I'm partly to blame
for what you've become.

551
01:02:30,018 --> 01:02:33,102
What have I become?

552
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,643
- A jerk, Todd.
- Aw...

553
01:03:23,692 --> 01:03:27,692
Thank you for coming. I...

554
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:30,402
I really need to talk to you.

555
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:34,026
- You're in a tough spot, huh?
- Yeah.

556
01:03:37,539 --> 01:03:39,912
I just let it get out of hand.

557
01:03:44,046 --> 01:03:47,996
I mean, I know you... you warned me.

558
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,512
And I guess I should've
listened, because...

559
01:03:56,516 --> 01:04:00,727
...I got a little crazy, Uncle Harold,
and I ended up hurting

560
01:04:00,895 --> 01:04:04,762
a lot of people that I really care about.

561
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,146
What are you gonna do about it?

562
01:04:09,362 --> 01:04:11,437
I don't know.

563
01:04:13,406 --> 01:04:15,778
I really don't know.

564
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:18,950
Well, don't be too tough on yourself.

565
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,248
After all, you're only human too.

566
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:26,327
So?

567
01:04:26,503 --> 01:04:30,749
So you made a mistake.
You admitted it. It's over.

568
01:04:30,923 --> 01:04:35,134
Maybe it's time you were Todd Howard again.

569
01:04:35,302 --> 01:04:37,378
I'm scared.

570
01:04:39,806 --> 01:04:41,550
Really scared.

571
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:48,520
If I'm myself in this ring tomorrow,
I could get killed.

572
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:51,145
I don't think you're gonna get killed.

573
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:56,653
This guy's really big. He's huge.

574
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,862
Never mind him.

575
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:03,908
'Cause what I'm interested in is you
and what you've got right there.

576
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,788
What does that matter
when the guy is twice your size?

577
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,372
- Well...
- I wouldn't stand a chance.

578
01:05:14,547 --> 01:05:16,790
Maybe not.

579
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:25,219
But sometimes you have to make
a stand. Even if you don't want to.

580
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:28,760
- What's that?
- Boxing gloves. They used to belong to me.

581
01:05:28,936 --> 01:05:34,096
- In college I used to box, too.
- Really?

582
01:05:34,275 --> 01:05:38,936
Yeah, I can show you some moves
nobody's seen in 30 years.

583
01:05:39,112 --> 01:05:41,353
- Now when's this big match?
- Tomorrow.

584
01:05:41,531 --> 01:05:43,074
Plenty of time.

585
01:06:13,644 --> 01:06:16,266
- What are you doing?
- Studying.

586
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:22,850
I still have two more finals.
I guess you wouldn't know about that.

587
01:06:30,117 --> 01:06:32,444
Nicki...

588
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,696
...I'm real sorry.

589
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,581
For everything.

590
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:43,255
- I guess the wolf makes you a jerk.
- No, I'm a jerk.

591
01:06:45,591 --> 01:06:50,881
I just hope that there's still time
to make up for it all.

592
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:04,810
- There's still time to try.
- I wanna try.

593
01:07:04,984 --> 01:07:08,317
You can start by saying you're really sorry

594
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:11,489
for mistreating someone you like.

595
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:15,322
I'm sorry for mistreating someone...

596
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:17,783
...I really love.

597
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,132
- You missed your final.
- What?

598
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:36,429
Your final.
I'm sure Professor Brooks flunked you.

599
01:07:36,597 --> 01:07:38,886
Oh? Yeah.

600
01:07:39,058 --> 01:07:43,720
- Maybe we could talk to her.
- Yeah.

601
01:07:48,984 --> 01:07:52,518
- Professor Brooks? Hi.
- Hi.

602
01:07:52,695 --> 01:07:55,981
We were just coming to see you.

603
01:07:56,158 --> 01:07:59,656
Listen, I know
I probably don't deserve it, but...

604
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:04,703
...if you would give me a second chance,
I'd really like to earn my grade.

605
01:08:04,874 --> 01:08:09,334
You can take a make up exam
tomorrow at noon at the latest.

606
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:13,583
I have to turn the grades in
by the end of the day.

607
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:19,510
- I have a fight at three.
- The test takes three hours.

608
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:23,262
- Take it or leave it.
- We'll take it.

609
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,590
Yeah, thank you very much.

610
01:10:08,115 --> 01:10:09,656
It's time.

611
01:10:18,665 --> 01:10:22,960
- Good luck on your test.
- Thanks.

612
01:10:23,128 --> 01:10:25,086
And at the match.

613
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:31,590
- Will you come see me box?
- Yeah.

614
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:48,765
- Good luck.
- Bye.

615
01:11:36,906 --> 01:11:41,533
Well, that's the best I could do.

616
01:11:41,703 --> 01:11:44,074
I missed a few classes.

617
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:54,378
It looks like you did well enough
to pass the course.

618
01:11:54,547 --> 01:11:56,124
Great.

619
01:11:58,135 --> 01:12:00,458
Professor Brooks,

620
01:12:00,636 --> 01:12:05,262
I really wanna thank you for trying to help

621
01:12:05,432 --> 01:12:08,302
when things got a little crazy.

622
01:12:09,395 --> 01:12:11,268
Welcome back.

623
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:37,078
- Where have you been?
- Taking a final.

624
01:12:39,172 --> 01:12:40,715
Where's the wolf?

625
01:12:40,883 --> 01:12:44,797
You got to go fight in
the 145 pound class now.

626
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:48,800
That's Peter's weight class.

627
01:12:48,973 --> 01:12:54,215
- Yeah, so what?
- Look coach, we are a team.

628
01:12:55,563 --> 01:13:00,936
We're gonna fight as a team.
And I am going up against Gus.

629
01:13:02,152 --> 01:13:03,944
That's great.

630
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:09,238
All of you go and get your brains
knocked out. That'll be attractive.

He'll do exactly as I say.

- You don't own him.
- Is this your idea of a threat?

No... this is.

667

You don't know who you're dealing with.

668
01:18:10,233 --> 01:18:13,731
- Yeah!
- Chubby, come on!

669
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:15,776
Box!

670
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:04,322
Cut. He's out.

671
01:19:04,492 --> 01:19:09,450
Let him go. Come on.
Put him down.

672
01:19:09,622 --> 01:19:13,619
Put him down so I can count.
Let's go. Come on.

673
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:16,165
He's out.

674
01:19:16,337 --> 01:19:22,457
All right, Chubby!
Come on out, dude.

Ladies and gentlemen!

677
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:41,521
Welcome to the
Hamilton University Memorial Arena.

678
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,401
Now entering the arena,

679
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:51,780
three-time state champion
from the Nimitz Academy

680
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,120
weighing in at 200 pounds

681

Steve "Gus" Gustavson!

682
01:20:01,587 --> 01:20:03,413
Boo!

683
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:06,044
Yeah! All right!

684
01:20:06,216 --> 01:20:09,632
Steve "Gus" Gustavson!

685
01:20:12,515 --> 01:20:16,642
Yeah, yeah, number one! Come on, yeah!

686
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:24,271
Now entering the arena, weighing in
at 195 wild and woolly pounds,

687
01:20:24,442 --> 01:20:28,820
Hamilton's own Todd "The Wolf" Howard!

688
01:20:35,619 --> 01:20:37,742
Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf!

689
01:20:42,418 --> 01:20:45,869
Todd "The Wolf" Howard.

690
01:21:04,437 --> 01:21:05,932
Where's the wolf?

691
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:12,564
Hey, where's the wolf?

692
01:21:12,737 --> 01:21:16,901
What's he doing?
Come on. Are you crazy?

693
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:21,992
- Come on!
- Oh man!

694
01:21:22,955 --> 01:21:26,454
- What is the meaning of this?
- Tactics?

695
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:29,461
I'll have him kicked out of this college.

696
01:21:32,131 --> 01:21:34,122
Dean Dunn?

697
01:21:35,759 --> 01:21:39,803
I won't be needing these anymore.
It's my last fight.

698
01:21:39,971 --> 01:21:42,925
Good. I hope he kills you.

699
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:45,547
He probably will.

700
01:21:45,727 --> 01:21:48,396
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Are you kidding?

701
01:21:48,563 --> 01:21:50,520
Pays to be positive, big guy.

702
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:55,772
Box!

703
01:21:57,363 --> 01:21:59,687
He made such a great wolf.

704
01:22:05,953 --> 01:22:08,195
Kill him, Todd!

705
01:22:19,258 --> 01:22:23,007
Come on. Hit me. Come on.

706
01:22:23,179 --> 01:22:26,843
Come on. Hit me. Come on.

707
01:22:27,015 --> 01:22:30,016
Come on. Hit me.

708
01:22:32,396 --> 01:22:35,183
My grandmother hits harder than that.
Take that.

709
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:47,481
Come on.

710
01:22:47,659 --> 01:22:49,368
Good round.

711
01:22:49,536 --> 01:22:53,913
- Come on. Try that with me, you freak.
- Come on. Come on.

712
01:22:54,082 --> 01:22:57,416
- Let go of me.
- Calm down. Round's over. Get back.

713
01:22:57,586 --> 01:23:00,705
Back. I'm warning you.

714
01:23:17,897 --> 01:23:19,639
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

715
01:23:19,814 --> 01:23:21,807
Cut the ring off on him.

716
01:23:26,654 --> 01:23:30,403
How are you doing?
Are you feeling Ok? Keep 'em up.

717
01:23:30,575 --> 01:23:34,359
- How's the ribs?
- Chubby.

718
01:23:34,537 --> 01:23:36,281
- How's the jaw?
- Ow!

719
01:23:36,455 --> 01:23:40,074
- I'm sorry I called the wolf a jerk.
- I was a jerk.

720
01:23:40,251 --> 01:23:43,370
If you don't turn back into the jerk,
we're gonna get killed.

721
01:23:43,545 --> 01:23:46,166
It's gotta be this way.

722
01:23:46,339 --> 01:23:49,755
Coach, you got anything to say to me?

723
01:23:49,926 --> 01:23:51,669
Well, um...

724
01:23:53,304 --> 01:23:54,715
...no.

725
01:23:57,350 --> 01:24:01,050
- Go and kick some butt, Todd.
- Take him out.

726
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:05,852
Break, break.

727
01:24:08,235 --> 01:24:12,529
- Step back.
- He's a baby. Come on.

728
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:15,732
Let's box.

729
01:24:30,339 --> 01:24:31,998
Come on, get up.

730
01:24:32,174 --> 01:24:34,630
- Come on.
- Ow! Ow!

731
01:24:36,595 --> 01:24:38,802
- Break.
- Let go of me, you sissy.

732
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:42,424
Let him go. Break. Break, I said. Box.

733
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:03,075
Get him. Go ahead.

734
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,739
Come on. Come on!

735
01:25:26,308 --> 01:25:27,422
Sit down.

736
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,681
- That's an early bell.
- Oh God.

737
01:25:31,855 --> 01:25:35,140
Come on, ref. Keep your eyes open.

738
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,986
Now listen.

739
01:25:43,157 --> 01:25:46,823
Unless you wanna wolf out,
I suggest we throw in the towel.

740
01:25:46,995 --> 01:25:48,275
I'm not quitting.

741
01:25:48,454 --> 01:25:50,494
Todd!

742
01:25:57,212 --> 01:25:59,620
It's not as bad as it looks.

743
01:26:08,723 --> 01:26:13,265
You're way ahead on points.
Keep fighting the same fight.

744
01:26:13,436 --> 01:26:16,852
Look at his face over there.
That guy's in trouble.

745
01:26:17,021 --> 01:26:20,023
You got it? Go! Get him!

746
01:26:22,987 --> 01:26:26,936
Touch gloves. Last round. Box.

747
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:34,074
Go, Todd, go!

748
01:26:34,247 --> 01:26:35,741
Do it!

749
01:26:49,511 --> 01:26:53,972
- I'm gonna make you howl with pain.
- It's gonna be a long night.

750
01:27:13,075 --> 01:27:16,194
Come on.
Get back in the ring. Let's go.

751
01:27:16,369 --> 01:27:20,071
He's gonna kill him.
Somebody do something.

752
01:27:20,249 --> 01:27:22,953
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

753
01:27:26,255 --> 01:27:28,745
Are you all right?

754
01:27:29,924 --> 01:27:31,716
Get back. Get back in there.

755
01:27:31,885 --> 01:27:33,959
- Where are you going?
- Home.

756
01:27:34,136 --> 01:27:36,295
Ok. Let's box.

757
01:27:50,109 --> 01:27:51,604
One.

758
01:27:55,239 --> 01:27:57,565
Two, three.

759
01:27:59,577 --> 01:28:01,119
Four.

760
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:34,354
Get up! Get up!

761
01:28:46,704 --> 01:28:48,496
Six.

762
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:56,460
I love you.

763
01:29:06,097 --> 01:29:07,342
Seven.

764
01:29:12,061 --> 01:29:14,766
Eight, nine.

765
01:29:44,383 --> 01:29:46,839
Come on, Gus!

766
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:50,012
Come on, dog. Fight like a man.

767
01:29:50,181 --> 01:29:52,090
Give me your best shot.

768
01:30:10,116 --> 01:30:11,361
Oh!

769
01:30:16,413 --> 01:30:17,991
Break. Break.

770
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:21,285
Stand back.

771
01:30:24,129 --> 01:30:25,208
He's out!

772
01:30:44,482 --> 01:30:49,607
The new regional champion
from Hamilton University

773
