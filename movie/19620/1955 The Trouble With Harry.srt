OK! I know how to handle your type.

(Thud)

7
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,637
Well, old faithful,
that's your shooting for the day.

8
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,270
If we haven't rung up
at least two rabbits,

9
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,034
we deserve to go home empty-handed.

10
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,113
Yeah, still, blessed are they
who expect nothing.

11
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,316
For they shall not be disappointed.

12
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,998
Mm. Fewer things in life give a man
more pleasure than hunting.

13
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,549
It satisfies his primitive nature,

14
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,474
striding through the woods,
picking up his kill.

15
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,915
Well, come on, old faithful.

16
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,914
There's plump rabbits
waiting for the frying pan.

17
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,437
If this can had four legs and a tail,
we'd be eating it tonight.

18
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,110
Clean through the heart.

19
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,316
For rice cake! I've done him in.

20
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,471
Cor.

21
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,271
A harmless pot-shot at a rabbit
and I'm a murderer, a killer.

22
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,113
Mother always said
I'd come to a bad end.

23
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,840
What in Hades were you doing here
anyway?

24
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,799
I can't say that I've seen you
around here before.

25
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,829
No. If you're going to get yourself
shot, do it where you're known.

Worp, you're a long way from home.

30
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,633
With the looks of it, you won't
get back for Christmas, now.

31
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,476
We're going to have a cold,
hard winter.

32
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,110
Mm. You might keep here a long time,
an awful long time.

33
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,271
Too long for me, Harry.

34
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,317
Yes.

35
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,917
Captain Wiles?

36
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,917
Yes, ma'am?

37
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,351
What seems to be the trouble,
Captain?

38
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,991
It's what you might call
an unavoidable accident.

39
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,470
- He's dead.
- Yes.

40
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,797
I would say that he was. Of course,
that's an unprofessional opinion.

41
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,270
Yeah. Did you...
did you know him, Miss Gravely?

42
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,353
- No. Doesn't live around here.
- Well, he died around here.

43
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,432
- That's what counts now.
- Embarrassing.

44
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,149
What do you plan to do with him,
Captain?

45
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,110
Miss Gravely, without cutting the hem
off truth's garment,

46
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,272
I'm gonna hide him, cover him up,

47
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,431
forget him.

48
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,038
Are you never going to inform
the police, Captain?

49
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,510
No. Forget you saw me, Miss Gravely.

50
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,717
Chase it out of your mind, for
heaven's sake, it was an accident.

51
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,714
He was poking around the clearing
and I thought he was a rabbit.

52
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,509
It was a human error.
Ah, now, please, don't...

53
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,877
Don't say anything to anybody,
Miss Gravely.

54
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,710
Do as you think best, Captain.

55
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,872
I'm sure you must have met
many similar situations

56
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,076
in your travels in foreign lands.

57
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,516
- Yeah, I've seen much worse things.
- I certainly won't say anything.

58
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,069
Much worse things.
I remember when I was on the Orinoco.

59
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,437
We had a Turk, a great, big Turk,
running amuck with a machete -

60
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,115
Captain, if I were going to hide
an accident, I shouldn't delay.

61
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,273
Oh. Oh.
You're right as rain, Miss Gravely.

62
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,228
Yes. You know something?
I'm glad I met you today.

63
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,153
I feel better for telling someone
as warm,

64
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,149
tender, understanding as yourself.

65
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,313
Well, on the contrary, Captain. It...

66
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,516
It...

67
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,478
I'm certainly glad
if I helped you, Captain.

68
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,791
Perhaps you would care to come over
for some blueberry muffins

69
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,633
and coffee later on,
high-bush blueberries?

70
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,553
Ah, well. This is certainly something
of an interesting surprise.

71
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,280
- And maybe some elderberry wine.
- Oh!

72
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,110
After all, we've been neighbours
for nearly three years now and...

73
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,271
we've never exchanged social calls.

74
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,193
You're right.
It's high time I paid a call.

75
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,830
- What time?
- Oh, say, early this afternoon.

76
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,675
I'll be there with a clean shirt
and a hungry face.

77
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,955
Do that.

78
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,757
You better be going now. Don't want
to be an accessory after the fact.

79
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,550
You are a considerate man,
Captain Wiles.

80
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,195
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

81
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,831
(Breathing Deeply)

82
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,229
(Boy) We're almost there, Mommy!

83
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,591
Here he is, Mommy. Here he is.

84
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,234
- What did I tell ya, Mommy?
- Don't touch it, Arnie.

85
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,996
- There he is.
- No. It can't be! Harry!

86
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,594
Harry, thank Providence,
the last of Harry.

87
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,070
- Who's Providence, Mommy?
- A very good friend.

88
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,390
- Don't you know who it is?
- You said Harry.

89
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,950
- Can't you remember, Arnie?
- Why don't he get up and move?

90
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,111
He's asleep.

91
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,670
He's in a deep sleep,
a deep, wonderful sleep.

92
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,831
How'd he hurt his head?

93
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,991
Putting it where it wasn't wanted,
would be my guess.

94
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,958
- Will it get better?
- Not if we're lucky.

95
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,071
Let's run home
and I'll make you some lemonade.

96
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,277
Will lemonade put me in a wonderful,
deep, deep sleep, Mommy?

97
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,431
No, Arnie, but it's better
than no lemonade.

98
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,195
- I don't understand that.
- Never mind. Forget you saw him.

99
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,272
- Is there a special way to forget?
- Just think of something else.

100
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,989
- I'll try not to see him tomorrow.
- That's a good boy, Arnie.

101
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,958
Now, let's run home
and get that lemonade.

102
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,159
She won't care what I do with him.

103
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,875
Couldn't have had more people here
if I'd sold tickets.

104
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,240
What's the big attraction, I wonder?

105
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,518
This could turn out to be
the luckiest day of my life.

106
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,034
I'll just wait till the whole world
comes to pay their last respects.

107
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,317
Sooner or later one of them has
to turn out to be the Deputy Sheriff.

Hello, Mr Marlowe.

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,471
Wiggy, you haven't sold a painting.
All my pictures in the same place.

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,838
So few cars. They don't... I guess
the cider takes their attention.

138
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,673
Cider, indeed.
Throw it away! Drink it.

139
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,832
- No, I hate cider.
- Not a picture sold.

140
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,197
I'm sorry, Mr Marlowe. Let's get
a look at your new one. Hold it up.

141
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,195
What good would it do? You don't
deserve to see it. How will I eat?

If there's more people there.

147
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,551
Oh, lots of people. Hundreds
and thousands and billions of people.

148
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,280
- It might be better then.
- But what sort of people, Wiggy?

149
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,431
What breed? I'll tell you.

150
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,957
They're little people,
little people with hats on.

Doesn't make much, needs the money.

156
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,439
Hm. Doesn't he get paid
for being deputy sheriff?

157
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,717
Piecework.
Gets paid by the arrest, I think.

158
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,030
(Car Engine Revving)

159
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,192
Ah, Mr Marlowe, it's wonderful.

160
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,512
- I've been in a tortured mood.
- What is it?

161
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,989
Good old Wiggy, my sternest critic.

162
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,392
I don't understand it but I think
it's beautiful. Mrs Rogers agrees.

163
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,676
- Oh? You talk about me?
- Well, I...

164
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,876
She's the pretty woman
with the little boy, isn't she?

165
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,156
Mm-hm.
I only brought up your name once

166
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,436
when we were talking
about strange people.

167
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,909
- Huh?
- That is, strangers.

168
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,196
- Oh.
- People she hadn't met yet.

169
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,828
What does the pretty,
little thing say about me?

170
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,991
Nothin'.

171
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,199
I think we better discuss business.
Here, my shopping list.

172
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,999
I'll go in and start puttin' it up.

173
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,311
(Humming)

174
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,833
Wiggy, how do you spell Tuscaloosa?

175
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,150
Sam?

176
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,875
- Hi, Calvin.
- You hear any shootin'?

177
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,917
- Nope.
- I did.

178
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,196
And there shouldn't be
any shootin' around here.

179
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,351
- Why?
- It's posted land, that's why.

180
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,638
- Why's that?
- 'Cause I posted it.

181
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,315
What's wrong with people doing
shooting now and then? Let off steam.

182
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,914
Bullets and guns are dangerous.
They kill things.

183
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,038
No one around here could hit
a freight car with a cannon.

184
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,356
I guess you're right, Sam.
All the same, the law's the law.

185
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,957
I got a mind to scout around to find
out who's shooting and level a fine.

186
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,509
And pick up a little piecework?

187
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,196
If I can do anything to make it
any harder for you, let me know.

188
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,271
(Horn Honking)

189
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,831
(Children Yelling)

190
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,751
(Dog Barking)

191
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,757
How'd you want your bacon,
Mr Marlowe?

192
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,390
- What were you saying?
- I asked how you want your bacon.

193
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,358
Sliced.
(Doorbells Jingling)

194
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,237
- Where is Calvin?
- Off somewheres unimportant.

195
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,358
(Breathing Deeply)
What a wonderful day.

196
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,114
So was yesterday, but you didn't say
anything to me about it.

197
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,396
What you want Calvin for?

198
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,120
These marvellous pictures.

199
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,555
Someone told me they were yours.

200
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,711
Why don't you sell them,
make a lot of money?

201
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,950
Never thought of it. I guess
I'll just have to think about it.

202
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,749
And that song. You sing it so
beautifully. You wrote it yourself?

203
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,911
What do you want to borrow?

204
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,595
I think people need encouragement
sometimes, don't you, Mr Marlowe?

205
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,752
- How'd you know my name?
- It's on the pictures, isn't it?

206
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,992
- It's not supposed to be readable.
- I can tell it's not supposed to be.

207
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,197
They're very professional,
don't you think, Mrs Wiggs?

208
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,955
Well, Miss Gravely,
all I know is nobody buys them.

209
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,871
Thank you for your encouragement,
Miss Gravely.

210
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,316
- Now I wonder how you know my name?
- Easy. Wiggy just said it.

211
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,711
Wiggy. What a perfectly ridiculous
little nickname.

212
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,996
Do you mind if I call you Wiggy,
Mrs Wiggs?

213
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,754
Not if you pay all your bills
on time.

214
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,196
Alright, Mr Marlowe,
Bacon, beans, cabbage,

215
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,875
sugar, salt, tea, oleomargarine.

216
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,918
- $1.95.
- And half a box of cigarettes.

217
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,277
- Ah, yes. Ten cents, two five.
- That much?

218
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,835
I don't seem to be able to find...

219
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,117
I know, Mr Marlowe, as soon as
we sell some of your paintings.

220
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,231
(Dog Barking)

221
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,348
Let me make my position clear -

222
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,511
Shhh.

223
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,671
What do you think?

224
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,595
I think it'll hold coffee.

225
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,235
Will you try it, Mr Marlowe?

226
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,116
Put your finger through the handle,
please.

227
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,514
How about the size?
What about the handle?

228
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,477
Hm?

229
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,598
I mean, does it fit?
Is it the right finger size?

230
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,830
It's my finger size.

231
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,314
- I'll take it.
- Fifteen cents.

232
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,471
- And the saucer?
- Ten.

233
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,269
- That seems a fair price.
- What's important about finger size?

234
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,989
I wanted to be certain
it would fit a man.

235
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,549
- A certain size man.
- A man?

236
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,429
A certain somebody is coming over
to my cottage this afternoon.

237
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,637
- Not really?
- For coffee and blueberry muffins.

238
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,870
Why, you old social butterfly, you.

239
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,393
Old?

240
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,471
That was figuratively speaking.

241
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,073
(Mrs Wiggs) I think we've got
a nearsighted cider customer.

242
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,549
(Miss Gravely)
How old do you think I am, young man?

243
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,111
Hmmm. Fifty.
How old do you think you are?

244
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,670
Forty-two. I can show you
my birth certificate.

245
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,879
You'll have to show more than your
birth certificate to convince a man.

246
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,634
- What do you mean?
- You have to show your character,

247
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,917
the inner self, the hidden qualities,

248
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,878
the true Miss Gravely,
sensitive, young in feeling,

249
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,713
timeless with love and understanding.

250
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,590
I can do it!
At least, I think I can do it.

251
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,875
Do what?

252
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,429
- I'll see what that gentleman -
- At a time like this?

253
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,716
- Where are your scissors?
- Outside.

254
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,871
We're going to cut her hair.

255
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,917
- Hair?
- Cut it short.

256
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,117
Bring it up-to-date,
make a nice romantic styling,

257
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,350
take ten years
off your birth certificate.

258
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,193
- How are you fixed for ribbon?
- Should be some around somewhere.

259
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,351
- Powder, rouge, lipstick?
- I think so.

260
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,114
Nothing cheap, shoddy or obvious.

261
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,192
Just youth, gentility, character.

262
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,069
I'll go out and get the scissors.
You find the other things.

263
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,675
(Doorbells Jingling)

264
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,308
(Door Closing)

265
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,951
(Humming)

266
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,712
- Ah, here they are.
- Excuse me, young man, I...

267
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,031
Oh, well.

268
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,189
All right, Ernest. Let's go.

269
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,517
Well, always grow back, I guess.

270
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,796
(Horn Honking)

271
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,951
There's Calvin.

272
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,477
- Is he alone?
- Yep. Guess he didn't sell his car.

273
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,594
Hey! Would you mind
getting out of my picture?

274
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,958
Next thing you know, they'll be
televising the whole thing.

275
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,597
Huh.

276
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,760
- This your body, little man?
- Don't turn me in.

277
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,388
It was an accident,
an accident, pure and simple.

278
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,551
I thought he was a rabbit
or a pheasant or something.

279
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,678
- It could've happened to you.
- Suppose we straighten this out?

280
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,910
I guess that's the only way out.

281
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,389
First thing I seen
when I rolled out this morning

282
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,994
was a double-breasted robin
drunk as a hoot owl,

283
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,276
from eating fermented chokecherries.

284
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,431
Right away I knew somebody
was in trouble.

285
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,433
What I didn't know
was that it was me.

286
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,990
The larder was empty and I got to
thinking about a toothful...

287
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,112
(Sam) Stands to reason
that they can't touch you for it.

288
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,630
Nothing these days
stands to reason.

289
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,837
It was accidental,
an act of God, perhaps.

290
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,708
In a way you should be grateful
that you were able to do your share

291
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,997
in accomplishing
the destiny of a fellow being.

292
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,595
Suppose, for instance,
it was written in the book of heaven,

293
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,751
that this man was to die

294
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,832
at this particular time,
at this particular place.

295
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,070
And suppose for a moment
that the actual

296
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,392
accomplishing of his departure had
been bungled, something gone wrong.

297
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,472
Uh... Perhaps it was meant to be
a thunderbolt

298
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,756
and there was
no thunder available, say.

299
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,388
Well, then you come along,
and you shoot him...

300
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,350
and heaven's will is done
and destiny fulfilled.

301
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,353
Your conscience is quite clear.
You've got nothing to worry about.

302
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,670
Sammy, I haven't got a conscience.

303
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,831
And it's not heaven
that's worrying me

304
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,991
because I don't expect
I'll ever have to face it.

305
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,390
And it's none of those noble things
you were talking about, no.

306
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,509
- Nothing like that.
- Then what is it?

307
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,513
(Sighs)
It's me. It's me that's worrying me,

308
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,398
me and my future life.

309
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,596
I know the police
and their suspicious ways.

310
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,796
You're guilty until
you're proved innocent.

311
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,396
I want nothing more to do with him.
Bury him, and be done with him.

312
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,710
He's no good to anyone now.

313
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,839
Lay him to rest.
Put him under the sod. Forget him.

314
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,309
I never did it and you never saw him.

315
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,630
Yes, what about all those
other people who saw him?

316
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,190
How about the woman and the boy,
Miss Gravely and the tramp and...

317
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,351
the man who was reading the book,
Dr Greenbow?

318
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,593
- How about all of them?
- Nobody was interested, I tell you.

319
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,035
Nobody ever cared
until you came along.

320
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,077
Ah, that's what you think.

321
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,390
Suppose someone starts to care
after you've buried him?

322
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,552
I can't wait for people to start
caring whenever they feel like it.

323
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,870
I don't want a little accident
to turn into a career.

324
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,550
Suppose that woman
who called him Harry...

325
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,836
Suppose she decides
she loves him after all.

326
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,118
- She was hysterical with delight.
- Hm? What was she like?

327
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,272
Pretty as a rainbow.
Wish I was two years younger.

328
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,432
- And with a little boy?
- Yeah, about four or five years old.

329
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,319
Hmm. It's got to be Mrs Rogers
and her son.

330
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,918
Why don't we slip him underground
now that you've finished drawing him?

331
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,389
We could discuss
the smaller details later.

332
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,398
I don't like it. The authorities
like to know when people die.

333
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,915
All right, Sammy.

334
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,152
Forget it. You cut off home.

335
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,550
I killed him
and I'll look after his remains.

336
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,190
What'll you do, drag him around the
countryside the rest of the day?

337
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,158
I'll do my best.
That's all a man can do.

338
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,959
If you're not careful, you will get
a murder charge lined up.

339
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,429
Matter of fact, I'm beginning
to suspect something myself.

340
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,397
There you are then. See?

341
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,394
If you, an artist, suspect the worst,
what will they, the police, think?

342
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,835
What about that envelope
with his name and address on it?

343
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,275
By rights, you should
mail him back home.

344
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,912
Have you forgotten who carries the
mail down to the station every night?

345
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,719
Calvin Wiggs, deputy sheriff.

346
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,075
Oh, yes. You're right.

347
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,516
I'll tell you what we'll do.
I'll tell you what.

348
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,148
We'll find out how well
Mrs Rogers knows this man,

349
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,834
and whether she intends
to notify the police of his death.

350
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,515
- What good will that do?
- Why, a lot of good.

351
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,196
If she's a distant friend of his and
doesn't plan to notify the police,

352
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,079
then I, personally,
will help you bury Harry.

353
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,671
Oh, Sammy!
You've signed on for the cruise.

354
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,149
(Chuckles) What time is it?

355
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,191
- About noon.
- Good heavens.

356
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,555
I've got to go home and spruce up.
I've got a date with Miss Gravely.

357
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,476
Not you. You are not the one.

358
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,238
Oh, Sam. She could do a lot worse,
you know?

359
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,235
Couldn't do any better. Just think,
you'd be establishing a precedent.

360
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,391
I'm not establishing nothing.

361
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,873
I am going over for blueberry muffins
and coffee by her own invitation.

362
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,759
And possibly some elderberry wine.

363
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,878
Do you realise that you'll be
the first man to...

364
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,031
cross her threshold?

365
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,433
Oh. Oh...
it's not too late, you know.

366
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,670
She's a well preserved woman.

367
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,991
- I envy you.
- Yes, very well preserved.

368
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,950
And preserves
have to be opened someday. Hm?

369
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,510
Yes. Now, you just trot down
and see what Mrs Rogers has to say.

370
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,797
- How about hiding Harry first?
- Holy smoke!

371
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,750
Forgetting a little detail
like that could hang a man. Yes.

372
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,272
(Mumbling)

373
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,351
(Groaning)

374
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,438
Oh. Oh, I beg your pardon.

375
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,591
(Speaking Indistinctly)

376
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,156
(Captain) I hope I never have to be
operated on by Dr Greenbow.

377
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,311
- Come on. Let's get going.
- Yeah.

378
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,671
(Mrs Rogers) Good afternoon.

379
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,755
You're beautiful, wonderful.

380
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,275
You're the most wonderful,
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

381
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,431
I'd like to paint you.

382
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,718
Was there something else
you wanted, Mr... Marlowe, isn't it?

383
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,629
You certainly are a lovely woman.
I'd like to paint you nude.

384
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,554
Some other time, Mr Marlowe. I was
about to make Arnie some lemonade.

385
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,076
Oh, yes, of course. Perhaps I've come
at an awkward moment.

386
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,595
If you want to undress me, you have.

387
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,751
Well, it wasn't exactly that.

388
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,229
I came here to talk to you about
something, but after I saw you it...

389
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,197
slipped my mind.

390
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,670
- It couldn't have been important.
- I guess you're right.

391
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,879
Sit on the porch. I'll get you a
lemonade. Maybe you'll think of it.

392
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,474
You're not only beautiful,
you're considerate too.

393
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,436
- Arnie!
- Hello, Mr Marlowe!

394
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,591
Hi. What do you got, a rabbit?

395
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,437
Dead. What have you got?

396
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,990
Oh, I got me a little frog.

397
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,752
Whoop!

398
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,749
- (Sam) There he is.
- (Mrs Rogers) It's hungry.

399
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,911
Whoop!

400
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,911
(Laughing)

401
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,353
- I'll trade ya.
- Your mother for mine?

402
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,354
- The rabbit for the frog.
- It's yours, Arnie.

403
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,273
I think you got the best deal.
Dead rabbits don't eat.

404
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,433
I'll just take it in the kitchen
and give him some lemonade.

405
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,635
Four rabbit's feet,
and he got killed.

406
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,157
- Should've had a four-leaf clover.
- And a horseshoe.

407
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,629
Say, how do rabbits get to be born?

408
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,234
- Same way elephants do.
- Oh, sure.

409
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,868
How come you never came over
to visit me before?

410
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,031
Didn't know you had such
a pretty mother, Arnie.

411
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,954
If you think she's pretty,
you should see my slingshot.

412
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,952
- Perhaps I'll come back tomorrow.
- When's that?

413
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,635
- The day after today.
- That's yesterday. Today's tomorrow.

414
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,190
- It was.
- When was tomorrow yesterday?

415
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,954
- Today.
- Oh, sure, yesterday.

416
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,157
(Mrs Rogers) You'll never make sense
out of Arnie. He has his own timing.

417
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,196
Thank you.

418
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,999
- Lemonade, Arnie?
- I already swiped two glasses.

419
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,039
- I would've given you two glasses.
- It's more fun to swipe.

420
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,191
Can I borrow your rabbit, Mr Marlowe?

421
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,351
Sure, Arnie.
What are you gonna do with it?

422
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,354
You never know when a dead rabbit
might come in handy.

423
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,311
It already got me one frog.

424
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,714
(Mrs Rogers)
Arnie! Where are you going now?

425
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,075
To make some more trades.

426
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,471
- Come home in time for supper.
- (Arnie) OK.

427
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,871
What's your given name? If you don't
want to tell me, just make one up.

428
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,038
Jennifer. Jennifer Rogers.

429
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,350
Nice.

430
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,671
Um, who's the man up on the path?

431
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,912
- What man?
- You know, Harry, the dead man.

432
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,631
Oh, him.

433
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,791
That's my husband.

434
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,349
Your husband's dead, then?

435
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,351
Is your lemonade sweet enough?

436
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,556
- It seems to be.
- I like it tart.

437
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,194
Harry is Arnie's father, then?

438
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,954
- No, Arnie's father's dead.
- So is Harry.

439
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,434
Thank goodness.
He was too good to live.

440
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,353
From his looks, he didn't appear to
me to be the kind who was too good.

441
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,829
Well, he was. Horribly good.

442
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,232
I like your mouth too,
especially when you say, "Good."

443
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,750
- Will you have some more lemonade?
- Well, maybe later. Thanks.

444
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,229
Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?

445
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,475
He found it.
Maybe the Captain shot it.

446
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,349
I'd like to hear more
of your life story.

447
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,511
You see, we don't know
quite what to do with Harry.

448
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,992
- Thought you might have suggestions.
- You can stuff him for all I care.

449
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,831
Stuff him
and put him in a glass case.

450
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,798
Only I'd suggest frosted glass.

451
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,193
What did he do to you,
besides marry you?

452
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,519
Look, I've wanted to explain
about Harry a lot of times...

453
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,877
(Church Bells Ringing)
But nobody would understand,

454
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,554
least of all, Harry.

455
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,711
But you...

456
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,872
You've got an artistic mind.
You can see the finer things.

457
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,793
When I'm lucky.
Go on, tell me everything.

458
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,155
Let it all out.

459
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,389
It was a long time ago and I was
in love. I was too much in love.

460
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,154
- What was his name?
- Robert.

461
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,232
We'd agreed to overlook each other's
families and get married.

462
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,392
- Did you?
- Oh, yes.

463
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,239
- And then Robert got killed.
- Oh?

464
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,829
I was heartbroken for six weeks.

465
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,833
Then I discovered little Arnie
was on the way.

466
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,390
- Must have been a shock.
- Well, that's where Harry came in.

467
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,628
Harry the handsome hero.
Harry the saint.

468
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,598
- Harry the good.
- I didn't catch his last name.

469
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,274
Harry Worp, Robert's brother,
his older brother.

470
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,396
And he fell in love with you?

471
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,552
If he'd have fallen in love with me,
I wouldn't have minded.

472
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,792
He wanted to marry me because he was
Robert's brother and felt noble.

473
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,190
But you thought he was
in love with you?

474
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,155
And I decided to let him
love me because of Arnie.

475
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,834
It was on my second wedding night
that I learned the truth.

476
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,313
You didn't learn on your first?

477
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,389
(Dog Barking)
This was a terrible truth...

478
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,630
The truth about Harry.

479
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,952
- Just what happened?
- How old are you, Mr Marlowe?

480
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,913
About 30.

481
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,231
This is what happened.

482
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,591
I was in the hotel room alone.
I put on my best nightie.

483
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,751
- You understand?
- Perfectly.

484
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,675
Although I had no true feeling
for Harry,

485
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,833
I worked myself into an enthusiasm
because I thought he loved me.

486
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,991
Must have been hard work.

487
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,149
There was a full moon,
and I sat by the window

488
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,471
because I thought it would show off
my new nightie to advantage.

489
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,232
Naturally.

490
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,076
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

491
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,516
You, a perfect stranger too.
I'm not boring you, am I?

492
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,591
No. Not at all.

493
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,509
- How about some more lemonade?
- Soon, soon.

494
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,911
Oh, where was I?

495
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,674
You were sitting by the window
because it was a full moon

496
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,400
and you'd worked yourself up
to a certain enthusiasm.

497
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,436
I said all that?

498
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,750
Uh, when does Harry come in?

499
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
He doesn't. He never came in.

500
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,479
- He called the following morning.
- The following morning?

501
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,313
In the hotel lobby the night before,
he bought a magazine.

502
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,710
- His horoscope was in it.
- Bad?

503
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,631
It said... He was a Taurus.

504
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,678
It said, 'Don't start
any new project that day.

505
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,230
- It could never be finished.'
- And what did you do?

506
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,359
I left him on the spot,
and went home to mother's. The end.

507
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,231
What a poignant story.

508
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,391
I knew you'd understand.

509
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,676
- Nobody else does.
- Not even mother?

510
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,593
She thought I should live with him,
but I wouldn't.

511
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,070
He pestered me to go back,
but I always refused.

512
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,471
Well, suppose some night
I wanted him to do something...

513
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,915
like the dishes, for example.

514
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,470
- His horoscope wouldn't let him.
- You're absolutely right.

515
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,791
There are some things
I just don't like to do by myself.

516
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,078
And no one with any true
understanding would blame you for it.

517
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,159
When Arnie was born, I moved to where
I thought Harry could never find me.

518
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,754
I changed my name and...

519
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,309
But he was persistent?

520
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,675
This morning there was a knock
on the door.

521
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,752
Before I opened it, I knew he was
standing on the other side.

522
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,036
- What did he want?
- Me!

523
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,760
He wanted me because I was his wife.

524
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,754
He wanted me because, as he put it,
he suddenly felt some basic urge...

525
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,911
- Loneliness.
- What'd you feel?

526
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,750
I felt sick. Did you see
his moustache and his wavy hair?

527
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,911
Yeah, but when I saw him,
he was dead.

528
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,516
Yeah, he looked exactly the same when
he was alive, except he was vertical.

529
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,955
So he entered. What'd you say?

530
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,032
Nothing. I hit him over the head with
a milk bottle and knocked him silly.

531
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,833
Silly?

532
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,551
Bats. Tappy.

533
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,393
He staggered up towards the woods
saying he was gonna find his wife

534
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,551
and drag her home if it killed him.

535
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,676
Apparently it did.

536
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,350
(Giggling)

537
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,512
(Horn Honking)
Have some more lemonade.

538
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,393
Why, Captain Wiles, what a surprise.

539
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,553
But you invited me, Miss Gravely.
At least that's how I remember it.

540
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,110
Of course I did, Captain,
but somehow, it's still a surprise.

541
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,193
Oh, yes. You certainly know
how to make a man feel wanted.

542
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,749
Won't you come in, Captain?

543
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,356
Thank you.
I... I've looked forward to it.

544
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,313
(Chuckling) Takes a real cook to
make a good blueberry muffin,

545
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,630
to keep the blueberries
from sitting on the bottom.

546
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,992
High-bush blueberries,
that's the secret.

547
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,154
I picked 'em up near where you shot
that unfortunate man.

548
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,400
A real handsome man's cup.

549
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,908
It's been in the family for years.

550
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,674
My father always used it
up until he died.

551
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,357
I trust he died peacefully,
slipped away in the night.

552
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,189
He was caught in a threshing machine.

553
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,594
I hope I haven't distressed you,
Captain.

554
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,751
Not at all. Not at all.

555
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,878
I'm used to looking on the rough side
of things.

556
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,349
I am man who's faced death
many times.

557
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,951
Rather recently too.

558
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,917
Yeah.

559
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,871
Arnie. What are you carrying there?

560
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,353
- A rabbit.
- (Captain) A rabbit?

561
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,879
- What do you call it?
- Dead. It ain't mine.

562
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,555
- Well, whose is it?
- Yours. You shot it with your gun.

563
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,553
You must've killed it today.
It should make a nice stew for ya.

564
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,029
A rabbit! I finally killed a rabbit!

565
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,431
- (Captain Wiles) Where'd you get it?
- In the blueberry muffins.

566
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,549
- What?
- Out in the woods.

567
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,190
Oh, here you are. One muffin
for one rabbit. Fair enough?

568
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,351
That was a two-muffin rabbit.

569
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,397
(Chuckles)

570
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,551
- I gotta go now.
- Oh.

571
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,552
(Sighs) Hm.

572
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,912
It's, uh, certainly a nice afternoon,
Miss Gravely.

573
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,071
- Isn't it?
- Mm.

574
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,789
Yes, and you're, you're a nice woman.

575
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,032
And I think you're awfully nice,
Captain Wiles.

576
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,239
Um, um.
Let's get back to our little problem.

577
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,516
Harry. What's going to become of him?

578
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,671
Oh, now, now.
Don't you worry about Harry.

579
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,035
He'll be comfortably
underground before nightfall.

580
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,478
All that digging and work.
Couldn't you just...

581
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,111
let him slide off the end
of your boat pier into the pond?

582
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,033
And have him pop up like a cork?
No, sir.

583
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,953
Nobody ever popped up
from under four feet of ground.

584
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,556
No. Besides, they'll be
cutting ice there this winter.

585
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,439
Now wouldn't it be a nice thing
if they were cutting blocks of ice -

586
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,592
Never mind, Captain. You're right.

587
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,354
Yes. Underground is the best place
for Harry.

588
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,877
He seems comfortable, Sam,
very comfortable and snug.

589
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,600
We better find a place and get it dug
and the sooner the better.

590
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,719
If what you say about Mrs Rogers
and her husband is true, I agree.

591
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,348
Well, let's find a place.

592
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,189
No use making hard work out of it. We
need a place where the earth is soft.

593
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,750
And a place where the whole town
won't stumble over us as we work.

594
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,595
Mm. A place with a certain
character and attractiveness.

595
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,957
Facing west so that Harry
can watch the setting sun.

596
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,351
- Where it'll be cosy in winter.
- And cool in the summer.

597
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,592
You know, I'm half envying Harry.

598
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,513
It wouldn't take much longer
to dig it twice as wide.

599
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,195
Well, thanks for your kindness,
but some other time.

600
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,478
- Here. This looks like a good place.
- Ahh!

601
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,393
You're a lucky fellow, Harry Worp.

602
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,550
- Come on, off with your coat.
- Who, me?

603
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,711
Certainly you.
It's your body, isn't it?

604
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,871
I'm not much of a hand
at grave digging.

605
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,952
You should've thought of that
before you went hunting this morning.

606
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,111
(Car Engine Revving)

607
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,953
Calvin Wiggs. What'll we do now?

608
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,317
Think up the best story
he's ever heard.

609
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,551
(Car Engine Recedes)

610
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,191
Lay down your shovel, Sam.

611
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,079
- What's the trouble?
- I'm dead beat.

612
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,391
Good.
I was dead beat ten minutes ago.

613
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,711
I wanted to keep digging
until you gave up.

614
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,152
- Brrrr! Gives me the creeps.
- Yeah?

615
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,198
Come on.
Let's get Harry and pop him in.

616
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,311
With hasty reverence.

617
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,229
There. Would you like to say
a few words, Captain?

618
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,473
Yes, I would. Harry Worp, don't ever
show your face around here again.

619
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,631
(Car Approaching)

620
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,835
Let's finish this job
and get out of here.

621
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,276
Captain, I think Calvin Wiggs
is looking for something.

622
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,670
Think he knows Harry Worp came here?

623
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,832
Sammy, that's as horrible
a thought as you've ever had.

624
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,036
And that he wonders what happened
to Harry and where he is?

625
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,795
My only answer is to keep
on scraping, and fast.

626
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,555
If you must kill things from now on,
I wish you'd stick to rabbits.

627
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,393
- The body's smaller.
- Rabbits! I didn't tell you, did I?

628
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,712
- I shot a rabbit today!
- Don't shout. I know you did.

629
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,633
I was up at Jennifer Rogers'
when Arnie showed me the rabbit.

630
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,076
Jennifer, eh?
Didn't waste much time, did you?

631
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,231
Well, I don't blame you, Sammy.

632
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,675
A very nice widow she'll make.
Very nice.

633
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,876
Let's discuss her
when we've finished with Harry.

634
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,759
No need to get huffy. I don't want
to talk about your affairs.

635
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,990
I've got affairs of my own.

636
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,072
- You mean my protge?
- Come again?

637
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,279
Miss Gravely. The lady I renovated
at Mrs Wiggs' this afternoon.

638
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,193
A most remarkable
reversion to femininity.

639
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,555
I don't quite get you, Sammy boy.

640
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,075
She came into the Emporium
in rather high excitement.

641
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,118
Wanted a new cup and saucer,
lots of other things.

642
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,397
I gave her a new makeup
and hairdo.

643
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,676
Don't tell me you didn't notice.

644
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,478
She's a nice lady.

645
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,234
- Very nice.
- We're all nice.

646
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,709
I don't see how anyone
could help but like guys like us.

647
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,668
I agree. I don't know whether
I've grown rose-colored glasses or -

648
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,717
Or if you're in love?

649
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,677
Aha! (Chuckling)

650
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,877
There's nothing like finding yourself
in love.

651
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,349
No, it adds zest to your work.

652
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,715
Zest! Zest!

653
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,274
I think I've had enough zest
for a while.

654
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,831
- Let's sit down and rest, huh?
- Oh, why not. We've earned it.

655
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,990
Tell me, Sam, What did Jennifer think
of my shooting?

656
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,151
You mean Mrs Rogers?

657
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,709
Oh, I think by now I'm entitled to be
on a first-name basis with her.

658
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,519
After all, I brought her a happy
release with one bullet.

659
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,353
One bullet? How 'bout that
"No Shooting" sign that I found?

660
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,318
Well, that. One bullet
for the "No Shooting" sign,

661
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,119
one for the beer can
and one for Harry.

662
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,431
- How about the rabbit?
- And one for the ra...

663
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,351
What's the matter?

664
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,876
- What's wrong? What's bitten you?
- I only fired three bullets.

665
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,510
Three! One for the shooting sign,
one for the beer can -

666
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,716
And one for the little man
who's lying in the grave.

667
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,348
No, Sammy, no. That's just it.
One for the rabbit.

668
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,670
If I shot the rabbit,
I didn't shoot Harry.

669
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,354
Oh, Sammy boy, what have you
tried to make me do?

670
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,511
Tried to make a murderer out of me.

671
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,593
Well, don't sit there. Help me!
You helped bury him.

672
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,989
Even if you didn't kill him, why dig
him up now that he's nicely planted?

673
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,230
I promised Jennifer
that we'd bury him.

674
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,391
Keep my word, he should stay buried.

675
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,278
Besides whether you killed him
or not, you've incriminated yourself.

676
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,513
You'll have more of a job explaining
a body that you didn't kill and bury,

677
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,355
than a body that you accidentally
killed and buried, right, Captain?

678
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,389
You're not supposed to bury bodies
whenever you find them.

679
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,630
It makes people suspicious.

680
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,439
Supposed to tell the police
or advertise or something.

681
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,395
Oh, Sammy, you don't understand.
You don't comprehend one bit.

682
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,677
You wouldn't like me to go through
life not knowing if I've killed him?

683
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,190
Very inconsistent. First, you tell me
you've got no conscience.

684
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,874
Now you talk about something that
sounds remarkably like a conscience.

685
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,031
Oh, Sammy, come on. Help me.

686
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,192
I don't care if I killed him or not,
for all that matters.

687
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,751
But I'll get the shakes
whenever I see a policeman.

688
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,877
All right.

689
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,191
If I had my choice, I'd rather be
thought a murderer than proved one.

690
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:00,229
Thank you. With two of us digging,
we'll have Harry out in nothing flat.

691
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,914
Can't see much from here. I'd better
get in down there and look at him.

692
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,073
- Let me do the honours.
- OK, Sammy. You've got good eyes.

693
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,398
Hey, that isn't a bullet wound.

694
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,189
Isn't a bullet wound?
Well, what d'ya know.

695
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,158
That's what they call a blow
with a blunt instrument.

696
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,754
Huh? What are you thinking, Sammy?

697
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,354
I think, Captain Wiles,
we're tangled up in a murder.

698
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,151
Murder? If it's murder, who done it?

699
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,677
- Who did it?
- That's what I say, who done it?

700
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,230
Apart from Jennifer Rogers,
who else'd want to kill him?

701
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,631
Apart from Jennifer?

702
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,031
- Yeah. Do you think that she would -
- Oh, it's ridiculous.

703
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,953
You said she was surprised to see
the body when she came up here.

704
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,315
You said she hit him on the head.

705
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,675
Coming home from Madagascar once,
we had a fireman on board

706
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,479
who hit his head on a brick wall
and died two days later.

707
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,870
Where could he find a brick wall
on board a ship?

708
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,838
Hmmm, that's what we always wondered.

709
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,475
Couldn't have been Jennifer. No.

710
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,029
Besides, what's it matter who did it?

711
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,998
It'll be better for all of us
if he's buried and out of the way.

712
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,232
Nothing doing. I'm not burying
someone else's bad habits.

713
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,595
Hmm? Suppose it was Miss Gravely?

714
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,150
What? (Laughing)

715
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,515
No, it's not as funny as all that.

716
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,671
You said yourself she wasn't
particularly startled

717
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,831
to see you dragging Harry
up the path.

718
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,594
You artists have got no idea
of etiquette.

719
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,799
She is a lady of gentle habits and
upbringing who hides her feelings.

720
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,111
If I wasn't holding Harry's ankles,
she'd have never mentioned him.

721
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,315
Really?

722
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,357
When she said...

723
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,875
'What seems to be the trouble,
Captain? ',

724
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,190
it was nothing more
than a pleasantry, so to speak.

725
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:57,992
Like, 'Nice day, isn't it? ' 'I'm
sure, yes.' Or something like that.

726
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,674
Going to help me bury him again?

727
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,037
Um... I don't know.

728
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,715
'Course, it might have been
Dr Greenbow or the tramp.

729
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,350
- Or Jennifer?
- I told you it couldn't...

730
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,638
Well, no point in arguing about it.
Let's get rid of him.

731
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,550
OK. You helped me in my hour of need.
I guess it's up to me to help you.

732
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,314
We'll file Harry away
once and for all.

733
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,630
No more nonsense about it.

734
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,553
Come aboard, Miss Gravely,
come aboard.

735
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,280
It's just an old salt's
snug anchorage.

736
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,910
Small, not palatial like yours,
But homely, very...

737
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,151
Won't you sit down, Miss Gravely?

738
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,751
Thank you.

739
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,753
It's funny. Funny how we got to be
so friendly in one afternoon.

740
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,708
I knew you weren't as prim
and starchy as they made out. No.

741
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,871
(Chuckling) Not by a long shot.

742
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,917
- Really?
- No.

743
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,311
I'm a man who can recognise
the human qualities in a woman.

744
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,471
When I first saw you
down where Harry was -

745
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,631
- Captain Wiles.
- Yes, ma'am?

746
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,268
Before you make your kind thoughts
known to me,

747
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,228
I should like to offer you some
explanation of my sudden invitation

748
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,039
to coffee and blueberry muffins
this afternoon

749
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,112
and my...
and my sitting with you here now.

750
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,350
No, ma'am,
you don't have to explain anything.

751
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,308
You came to my aid at a moment of
crisis, for which I'm truly grateful.

752
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,516
Thank you, but it's just that
I owe you some reason.

753
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,875
No, no, no.
I won't hear a word of it.

754
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,395
You saw the predicament I was in
with that body on my hands

755
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,758
and you shut your eyes to it in a
most sporting fashion, if I say so.

756
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,036
- Captain Wiles.
- Yes, ma'am?

757
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,795
I'm trying to tell you the reason
I asked you to coffee and muffins.

758
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,394
It was because... I felt -

759
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,551
- Sympathy.
- Gratitude.

760
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,439
Gra...? But I'm the one
who should be grateful.

761
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,276
No, I was grateful.
I... I am grateful.

762
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,274
I'm grateful to you
for burying my body.

763
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,197
Your body?

764
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,835
The man you thought you killed...

765
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,039
was the man I hit over the head with
the leather heel of my hiking shoe.

766
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,315
You?

767
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,150
And with a metal cleat
on the end of it.

768
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,435
But why?

769
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,111
He annoyed me.

770
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,714
I was walking towards home when he

771
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,189
suddenly came at me
with a wild look in his eye

772
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,157
and insisted...

773
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,551
- we were married.
- Oh, you knew each other before.

774
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,713
Believe it or not, I had never
seen him before in my life and...

775
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,394
if I ever had,
I never would have married him.

776
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,869
He must have mistaken you
for someone else.

777
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,749
Oh, no, he very definitely
pulled me into the bushes.

778
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,438
- Yes?
- I came out again.

779
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,917
Go on.

780
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,071
He pulled me back.

781
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,399
Twice.

782
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,159
He swore at me,
horrible, masculine sounds.

783
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,392
- I didn't understand it, of course.
- Of course you didn't.

784
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,149
- We fought.
- Then what?

785
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:50,957
I won. My shoe had come off
in the struggle, and I hit him.

786
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,749
I hit him as hard as ever I could.

787
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,631
You killed him.

788
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,033
I must have done it.
I was annoyed, Captain.

789
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,236
- Very annoyed.
- Naturally.

790
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,392
I don't think
I've ever been so annoyed.

791
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:16,190
Consequently, I... I didn't
realise my own capabilities.

792
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,272
Whew! Seems to me...

793
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,432
Mrs Rogers knocked him silly,
and you finished him off.

794
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,435
Why should Mrs Rogers
knock him silly?

795
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,591
She was really his wife.

796
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,877
Poor woman.
I thought she had better taste.

797
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,671
You know, Captain,

798
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,515
when I ran away I decided I would
never tell a soul what had happened.

799
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,114
Then I met you, and I thought...

800
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,276
how convenient it was that you
should think that you had shot him.

801
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,591
- Forgive me for thinking that.
- Only natural.

802
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,356
That's why I felt... I still feel
under an obligation to you.

803
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,715
Oh, not at all. Let's forget it.

804
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,758
Oh, no, we mustn't do that.
It would hardly be fair to you.

805
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:06,588
For you to go through life knowing
you had buried a man you didn't kill.

806
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,035
You would have my crime
on your conscience.

807
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,919
It's a pleasure, (Hiccups)
I'm sure.

808
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,116
But no.

809
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,397
Now I realise that Harry man
was out of his mind,

810
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,551
and my action was justifiable,

811
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,429
there's no reason we shouldn't let
the authorities know about it.

812
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,956
- The authorities?
- Everything will be cleared up.

813
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,793
I'm sure Calvin Wiggs and the police

814
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,190
won't make a fuss about it
when we explain.

815
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,555
Perhaps it needn't get
into the papers at all.

816
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,837
Don't you believe it. They love it,
the papers, this kind of thing.

817
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,230
Murder and passion.

818
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,960
You let Harry be.
Just forget it ever happened.

819
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,556
The same as Sammy and me
and Jennifer Rogers are going to do.

820
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,111
Oh, but... but it isn't your body.

821
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,558
After all, I killed him, so it's only
fair that I should have the say so -

822
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,312
- Yes, but -
- Don't you agree?

823
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,152
- Well, in a way -
- I thought you would.

824
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,117
I tell you what, Captain.

825
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,674
- We'll go and get a spade now.
- But ma'am -

826
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,354
And after we've dug him up,
we'll go back to my place

827
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,512
and I'll make you
some hot chocolate.

828
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,717
Arnie's so tired he'll sleep all day
and half the night.

829
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,553
I think you've got a pretty house,
Jennifer.

830
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,757
It's the best I could do
on Robert's insurance.

831
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,349
- Sugar?
- No, black, thanks.

832
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,957
It's funny, but...

833
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,350
I feel awful comfortable with you,
Sam.

834
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,875
You know, I feel the same way too.

835
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,031
It's a good feeling,

836
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,398
feeling comfortable with someone
who feels that way too.

837
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,480
There is one thing
I feel uncomfortable about.

838
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,632
Just tell me what it is,
and I'll take care of it for you.

839
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,396
- It's Harry. What about Harry?
- Harry? Don't you think about Harry.

840
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,711
Harry's part of the earth.
He's with eternity, the ages.

841
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,348
Take my word for it,
Harry's ancient history.

842
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,715
(Knocking At Door)

843
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,871
Come in, whoever it is.

844
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,871
What happened?

845
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,554
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

846
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,030
No, Captain,
I have something to tell him.

847
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,839
Now who's going to tell what?

848
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,276
(Sighs) I killed Harry
with the heel of my shoe.

849
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,072
So it was you.

850
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,356
We're on our way to get Calvin Wiggs.

851
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,592
- And have him call the state police.
- I keep telling her there's no need.

852
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,589
He's right and, besides, it'd be
indecent. Harry's dead and buried.

853
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,876
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

854
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,871
You haven't dug him up again.

855
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,951
Well, I...

856
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,790
(Miss Gravely)
I insisted, Mr Marlowe.

857
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,669
- Don't you understand?
- You have nothing to fear.

858
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,391
It's my concern entirely.

859
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,269
As soon as Captain Wiles told me the
full circumstances of his being here

860
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,431
I knew there was nothing for me
to hide.

861
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,591
You know all about Harry?

862
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,990
Well, I'm afraid I do, Mrs Rogers,
and...

863
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,675
and after all, nobody could possibly
gossip about a lady and a maniac.

864
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,831
You'd be surprised.

865
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,639
You don't quite understand
what murder involves, Miss Gravely.

866
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,030
It'd be hours and hours
of questioning and photographs,

867
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,919
and the whole of your private life
spread indecently in the newspapers.

868
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,197
What makes you think
my private life is indecent?

869
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,033
I didn't mean that. I meant that
the way they pry is indecent.

870
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,712
They'll hound you to death.

871
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,871
There'll be newspapermen,
photographers, detectives.

872
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,110
I've made up my mind.

873
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,271
She certainly has.

874
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,079
It was Captain Wiles here
who persuaded me to call

875
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,834
and tell Mrs Rogers
what I proposed to do.

876
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,879
After all, she is most closely
connected with the business.

877
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,315
What do you think about it,
Mrs Rogers?

878
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,597
I can't see why you're all
making such a fuss about Harry.

879
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,911
If he was buried, I don't see
why you had to dig him up.

880
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,038
But since you have, I guess
you'd better do what you think best.

881
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,590
I don't care what you do with him,
as long as you don't revive him.

882
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,671
I have a free hand, then.

883
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,992
Free as a bird. As far as I'm
concerned, it's ancient history.

884
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,151
Wait a minute, Jennifer.

885
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,470
I think we've forgotten something.

886
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,473
Do you realise if this comes out,
that all the details of your marriage

887
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,835
will be public property?

888
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,559
Oh.

889
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,589
- I hadn't thought of that either.
- Where'd you put Harry this time?

890
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,591
Over by the big oak tree.

891
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,951
- I'll get my shovel.
- I'm causing you a lot of hard work.

892
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,236
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all, Not at all.

893
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,189
Well, let's all go up there.

894
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,189
You know, I've never been to a
home-made funeral before. (Chuckles)

895
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,749
Hm. I have.

896
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,514
This is my third.

897
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,355
All in one day. (Sighing)

898
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,511
(Clock Chiming)

899
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,157
(Sam) Well, let's get it over with.

900
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,117
Yes.

901
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,794
(Captain)
I think we ought to cement it over.

902
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,191
(Miss Gravely) Next spring
I'll set out some blueberry bushes.

903
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,874
(Captain) Couldn't you make it
something else? Lilac, maybe.

904
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,031
(Sam) I think nature'll
will take good care of it.

905
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,670
- (Captain) How about a service?
- (Sam) I Can't think of what to say.

906
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,718
- Besides, my arms ache.
- (Jennifer) It's late for a prayer.

907
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,077
Besides, wherever he was going,
he's there now.

908
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,549
Bye, Harry. I forgive you.

909
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,591
(Trumpet Sound)

910
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,470
- (Captain) Trumpets welcoming Harry.
- (Jennifer) You didn't know Harry.

911
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,394
(Sam) I want to paint you, Jennifer.
You're beautiful in the moonlight.

912
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,152
(Trumpet Sound)

913
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,311
(Captain) Sounds as if it's
coming down from near the village.

914
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,075
(Miss Gravely) I know what it is.
The call of the phantom stagecoach

915
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,959
that used to pass by here
each night 200 years ago.

916
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:58,511
- (Chuckling) Phantom ghost?
- The turnpike ran across the hills.

917
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,319
(Sam) Oh, to be a highwayman
on a night like this.

918
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,630
(Jennifer)
Listen. Somebody's running.

919
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,394
- (Miss Gravely) Horses?
- (Sam) A horse that can shout.

920
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,393
- What's she saying?
- We'll know soon. She's coming here.

921
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,111
- Sam Marlowe!
- It's Wiggy. Old Wiggy.

922
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,351
Mr Marlowe!

923
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,034
Mr Marlowe!

924
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,432
- Wiggy, what on earth do you want?
- I... He wants...

925
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,716
- Wait a minute, Catch your breath.
- He's a millionaire!

926
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,872
- Who?
- He wants to buy your pictures.

927
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,951
- Which pictures?
- All of 'em and more besides.

928
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,111
He says you're a genius.

929
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,477
He's right, but it's hard to believe
he wants to buy all my pictures.

930
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,995
(Miss Gravely) I'd be too curious
to refuse to at least to talk to him.

931
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,390
(Wiggy) Don't turn down
a good chance, Mr Marlowe.

932
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,869
All right, I'll talk to him.

933
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,437
- (Captain) We dug sassafras root.
- (Wiggy) Sassafras tea is healthy.

934
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,592
Mr Wiggs always swore it cured
his arthritis just before he died.

935
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,751
(Captain) How much does
the millionaire want to pay?

936
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,311
I said seven dollars for the one that
looks like blobs in a thunderstorm.

937
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,471
- (Sam) And?
- He said they are priceless.

938
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,473
(Captain) Priceless? Sounds like
something I painted in kindergarten.

939
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,438
(Sam) That picture is symbolic
to the beginning of the world.

940
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,068
(Captain) That's where I first heard
of the world, in kindergarten.

941
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,790
Yes, and my friend here, art critic
for the modern museum, he -

942
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,555
Don't think I'm rude, but it doesn't
matter to me what an art critic says.

943
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,757
- Is that so?
- I know my paintings are good.

944
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,151
He doesn't want them, you do. So
all that matters is what you think.

945
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,836
Well, I think they are works of
genius, and I want to buy them all.

946
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,035
- Too bad.
- Why?

947
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,556
Just decided I can't sell them.
Besides, you couldn't afford them.

948
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,711
Oh.

949
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,553
- Uh...
- Money.

950
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,395
Sammy. Don't be a fool.
Make him pay through the nose.

951
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,393
Go ahead, Mr Marlowe, be reasonable.

952
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,394
- Be unreasonable, if you want.
- What do you say?

953
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,915
It's your genius, Sam.
It's up to you.

954
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,790
All right then. What do you like most
in the whole world?

955
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,997
I don't know. Strawberries, I guess.

956
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,751
Strawberries. Write that down.

957
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,515
Two boxes of fresh strawberries, each
month, in season and out of season,

958
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,636
from now on.

959
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,791
(Millionaire)
Well, it's simple. What else?

960
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,951
What would Arnie like?

961
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,431
A chemical set.

962
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,512
- (Sam) What kind?
- Whatever smells the worst.

963
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,911
- Got that?
- Right.

964
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,674
One smelly chemical set.

965
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,831
Wiggy, Wiggy, what would you like?

966
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,195
Cash register, chromium plated,
one that rings a bell.

967
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,635
- (Sam) Got room for one?
- I'll find room.

968
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,394
- (Sam) Cash register.
- Chromium plated, rings a bell.

969
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,199
Check.

970
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,113
Miss Gravely,
a beauty parlour, fully equipped?

971
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,271
What for?

972
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:54,991
A hope chest... filled with things
I should have put in it but didn't.

973
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,599
A hope chest, full of hope.

974
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,917
Captain?

975
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,038
A good shotgun, plenty of ammunition,

976
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:09,194
some corduroy britches, a plain shirt
and a hunting cap. A brown one.

977
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,789
Davy Crockett, the works.

978
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,951
Well, that's it, I guess.

979
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,112
- The paintings are yours.
- Yes, but what about you?

980
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,635
Yes, Sam,
you've gotta ask for something.

981
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,191
Well, let's see.

982
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,997
That's it.

983
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,752
What's it?

984
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,717
Pardon me.

985
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,671
What do you think?

986
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,231
Yes,
I think that can be easily arranged.

987
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,871
Well. That's it, then.

988
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,998
I'll come back in the morning
for all these paintings.

989
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,991
Mr Marlowe,

990
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,072
this has been a night that I shall
remember the rest of my life.

991
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,038
Come back again. I'll have some more
paintings for you next month.

992
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,351
And you'll have a steady customer
in me,

993
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,954
even if you raise your prices.

994
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,237
- Well, good night, everyone.
- (All) Good night.

995
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,630
All right, young man.
(Millionaire Clears Throat)

996
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,670
(Captain) Congratulations, Sammy!
Good boy!

997
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:21,550
- (Sam) Did I do the right thing?
- You did just the right thing, Sam.

998
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,711
Good.

999
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,915
Because it's important to me
that you think so.

1000
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,991
Why?

1001
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,958
Because I love you.
I want to marry you.

1002
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,471
Oh! (Giggling)

1003
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,310
- You want to marry me?
- Uh-huh. Why not?

1004
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,712
Well...
because I just got my freedom today.

1005
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,189
Easy come, easy go.

1006
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,353
Besides, if you married me,
you'd keep your freedom.

1007
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,720
You must be practically unique, then.

1008
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,555
I respect freedom.
More than that, I love freedom.

1009
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,712
We might be the only free
married couple in the world.

1010
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,869
This is very sudden, Sam.

1011
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,752
You'll have to give me
a little time to think about it.

1012
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,674
Only fair. I'll give you
until we get back to your house.

1013
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,909
(Door Opening)

1014
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,870
- What's goin' on here at this hour?
- (Wiggy) The most wonderful thing.

1015
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,429
Mr Marlowe sold all his paintings
to a millionaire.

1016
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,909
- Got more'n I ever figured he'd get.
- Money?

1017
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,231
Well, not exactly money.

1018
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,313
I always knew
they weren't worth the space.

1019
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,995
I found these on a tramp
hangin' 'round here.

1020
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,720
Said he found 'em on a... dead man.

1021
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,552
Took me to where he said
he found him, and...

1022
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,992
I didn't see any body.
(Ringing)

1023
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,590
(Calvin) Montpelier 2000.

1024
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,320
- (Wiggy) That's the state police.
- (Calvin) Uh huh.

1025
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,153
I think, uh, we'd better get going.

1026
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,595
(Wiggy)
Thank you for the cash register.

1027
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,751
It was a pleasure. Good night.

1028
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,876
Good night. Good night.

1029
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,031
- Good night.
- Good night.

1030
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,191
Good night, Captain.

1031
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,990
(Door Closes)
This is Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs.

1032
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,151
Yeah, I'll wait.

1033
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,958
Ma?

1034
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,997
Yes?

1035
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,152
- This picture here on the floor.
- It's a new one.

1036
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,675
He did it today,
but it isn't for sale.

1037
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,513
- Why not?
- You'll have to ask him that.

1038
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,478
He left it on his way
over to Jennifer Roger's house.

1039
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,199
Guess he didn't have time
to take it home.

1040
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,556
You suddenly got interested in art?

1041
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,398
No.

1042
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,394
But... it's just that it matches
the description of -

1043
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,869
Oh, hello, Sergeant.

1044
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,031
Calvin Wiggs.

1045
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,078
Got something
that might interest you a little.

1046
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:23,710
It seems I picked up this tramp
with a pair of stolen shoes...

1047
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,189
and a wild story about a corpse.

1048
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,919
What do you think? Him walking in
with Harry Worp's shoes in his hand?

1049
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,071
And then that phone call
to the police?

1050
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:56,631
I don't know. I may be wrong, but I
don't think he's tied us into it yet.

1051
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,791
Oh, the way he looked at me.

1052
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,554
If he'd known anything,
he'd have kept us there.

1053
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,759
But modern police methods
are all psychological now, Sammy.

1054
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,391
They just wear you down
and wear you down until...

1055
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,951
you're almost grateful
to get into that gas chamber.

1056
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,910
The police would probably tell him,
if the shoes fit, to keep them.

1057
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,071
Oh, well.

1058
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,752
- I've decided, Sam.
- Decided what?

1059
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,391
I will marry you, if you haven't
forgotten about asking me.

1060
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,237
I'm... I'm very fond of you and...

1061
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,109
I think you'd make a good father
for Arnie.

1062
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:52,353
And for some other reasons
best left unsaid.

1063
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,514
Marriage is the comfortable way
to spend the winter,

1064
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,319
but right now we should be
working on some good story

1065
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,109
to satisfy the State Police
if they should turn up.

1066
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,273
Would you believe it?
I'd almost forgotten that proposal.

1067
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,796
- I have witnesses, Sam.
- Oh, I remember now.

1068
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,589
All right,
you've got yourself a husband.

1069
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,558
I think I'll kiss you now
to prove it.

1070
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,795
Lightly, Sam.
I have a very short fuse.

1071
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,315
What a pretty sight.

1072
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,233
Sam, what did you ask
the millionaire for?

1073
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,591
(No Audio)

1074
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,755
That's very practical.

1075
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,269
- Congratulations, my dear.
- You're a lucky man, Sammy.

1076
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,159
- I think you'll both be very happy.
- Thank you.

1077
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,677
If I grumbled too much at my share of
the work in burying Harry, I'm sorry.

1078
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,990
I can see now it was well worth it.

1079
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:19,278
- And if I can do anything else -
- Hold it! Hold it, hold it!

1080
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,311
What's wrong, Sam?

1081
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,358
Harry. We're not quite finished
with him yet.

1082
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,830
Sam, if anybody's through, it's
Harry. He's been buried three times.

1083
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,230
Before we can get married, you're
gonna have to prove that you're free.

1084
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,391
To prove you're free, you'll
have to prove that Harry -

1085
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,312
Is dead.

1086
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,231
What a horrible complication.

1087
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,391
Oh!

1088
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,631
I don't know that it is.

1089
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,832
What are you looking at me for?
You...

1090
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,560
Sammy, I'll do anything to help you,
but please,

1091
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,234
please don't ask me to dig up
Harry again!

1092
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,472
- Oh, come, come now, Captain.
- No, we can't.

1093
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,359
- You're thinking of bad publicity -
- (Jennifer) No, I'm not.

1094
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,275
I think Sam would be worth
just about anything.

1095
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,829
I'm thinking of you, Miss Gravely.

1096
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,198
Murder is murder, no matter how
exonerating the circumstances.

1097
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,954
It just wouldn't look nice at all
for you.

1098
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,793
That's right!
Better let him stay where he is.

1099
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,555
You'll only have to wait seven years
to presume death, anyway.

1100
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,553
- Seven years! I'll be an old man.
- Don't be silly.

1101
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,756
You waited far longer
than seven years already.

1102
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,309
Yes, but now I know
what I'm waiting for.

1103
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,869
(Miss Gravely) I insist that you dig
the wretched man up.

1104
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,235
I don't care a hoot what they say.

1105
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,710
They'd only have to know me to
realise the man must have been mad.

1106
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:43,873
- I disagree! Huh!
- Really, Captain Wiles?

1107
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,472
Well...

1108
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,111
I'll dig him up but we'd better
get it done before Calvin Wiggs

1109
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,431
gets the state police
snooping around here.

1110
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,509
(Jennifer) I've been thinking.

1111
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,797
I've been thinking maybe we could
forget the way it really happened.

1112
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,952
I could tell how Harry visited me
and went off in such a rage today

1113
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,509
and that's all we'd need to know
about his being there.

1114
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,671
No, somebody else
might get the blame.

1115
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,752
And somebody else might not
have such a good reason as I did.

1116
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,760
What do you mean 'somebody else'?

1117
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,558
I can think of two people with
a good reason for having killed him.

1118
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:31,595
First you, because you married him.
And now Sam.

1119
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,752
Me? Why would I want to kill him?
I never met him before.

1120
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,354
You could still have a reason
for killing him.

1121
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,476
- She means me.
- Yes.

1122
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,916
I didn't fall in love with Jennifer
until after Harry was dead.

1123
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,957
Try telling that to the police.

1124
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,111
She's right, Sammy boy.

1125
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,359
On second thought, we'd better stick
to the truth, what there is of it.

1126
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:02,679
We must think up a reason why the
police weren't informed before now.

1127
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,991
Yes, then there's the condition he's
in. That will take some explaining.

1128
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,711
We'll just clean him up a bit.

1129
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,394
It's horrible,
but there's nothing else we can do.

1130
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,949
We can't risk complicating
Miss Gravely's confession.

1131
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:17,715
As for the delay, I can explain that
I was so upset by the occurrence

1132
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,235
that I went straight home and rested.

1133
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,836
- Only natural.
- They'll think you had a long rest.

1134
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,833
Sam, I'd rather not spend
the whole night debating.

1135
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,389
Let's get Harry someplace
and clean him up.

1136
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:33,439
(Man Talking)
(Captain) Let's get out of here.

1137
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,356
Love alters not
with his brief hours and weeks,

1138
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,069
But bears it out
even to the edge of doom,

1139
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,038
If this be error and upon me proved,

1140
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,954
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

1141
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,393
I, uh, I think he met with a bit
of an accident, Dr Greenbow.

1142
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,551
He certainly did.

1143
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,871
Which of you found him?

1144
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,713
- Well -
- He was my husband, Doctor.

1145
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,592
Oh, Mrs Rogers. I didn't know you
had a husband. I'm awfully sorry.

1146
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,632
It's all right, Doctor.
It's just life, I guess.

1147
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,234
- What happened to him?
- Well, he -

1148
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,951
We want to know too. Can you say what
caused his death? It was so sudden.

1149
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,588
In this light, my opinion
would be little more than a guess.

1150
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,558
In that case, we could take him
someplace where you could see better.

1151
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,917
All right, but I need my bag.
Where should we meet?

1152
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,878
I'll take Harry home to my house.

1153
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,829
Going home for the last time.

1154
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,390
Better be the last time.

1155
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,951
Come on, Sam. I've got
about one more trip left in me.

1156
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,111
I'll get your coats.

1157
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,909
I'll get the suspenders on.

1158
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:11,119
I can't wait for this to be ready.
I'll have to iron it dry.

1159
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,991
Isn't it odd?

1160
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,551
After refusing for so long, here
I am finally doing Harry's laundry.

1161
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,711
(Groaning)

1162
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,552
Ah!
(Whispers) Look.

1163
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,239
It's nothing to get excited about,
Captain.

1164
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,675
It's only a closet door.

1165
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,874
Oh. I thought it was Harry.

1166
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,393
Relax, Captain.

1167
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,436
What about the cut I made on his head
with my hiking shoe?

1168
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,273
(Jennifer) Hmm.
I'll put some adhesive tape on it.

1169
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,431
They'll think it was done
before he died.

1170
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,398
After the shirt's finished,
it should be just about everything.

1171
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,357
(Car Approaching)

1172
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,795
- If that who I think it is -
- Calvin Wigg's car.

1173
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,911
(Door Buzzer Buzzing)

1174
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,231
(Buzzing)

1175
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,594
(Jennifer) Just one second.

1176
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,071
(Buzzer)

1177
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,314
Well, Calvin Wiggs. What a surprise.

1178
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:52,153
- Sam here?
- Yes, yes, yes, he's here.

1179
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,311
Can I see him a minute?

1180
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,391
- Sam?
- Yeah?

1181
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,189
- Calvin Wiggs is here to see you.
- Tell him I'll be right out.

1182
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,670
- He says he'll be right out.
- Why don't I just go on in?

1183
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,957
Evening, Calvin.

1184
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,112
Evening, Captain Wiles.
Miss Gravely.

1185
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,669
We've got 'em on the run
in four spades.

1186
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,833
They should have been in diamonds.
Play much bridge?

1187
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,389
- Never play it.
- That's what I thought.

1188
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,198
Something you wanted, Calvin?

1189
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:30,434
- Where were you today, Sam?
- Working, as usual.

1190
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,319
Somewheres down
by Mansfield Meadows?

1191
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,794
Possibly. I do quite a bit
of sketching around. Why?

1192
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,515
Is that where, uh...

1193
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,510
Where you painted this?

1194
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,875
I left that portrait
with your mother.

1195
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,634
What right do you have to carry it
around with you? It might be damaged.

1196
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,554
Yeah. It could be priceless,
and Sam would lose a sale.

1197
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,359
Oh, I'll send him a box of
blueberries the first of every month.

1198
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,112
Sam, what I wanna know is where'd
you paint it and who is it.

1199
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,433
First of all, it's not a painting,
it's a drawing.

1200
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,912
Matter of fact, it's a pastel and...
as for the model...

1201
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,958
- It just came to me out of the blue.
- You don't say.

1202
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,475
Why are you acting
like a deputy sheriff?

1203
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,200
That tramp I picked up,
the one with the stolen shoes?

1204
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,828
Said he got 'em off a dead man?

1205
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,879
He described him very carefully. The
description fits the picture exactly.

1206
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,635
A tramp who probably can't keep
his job and drinks too much.

1207
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,075
I wouldn't think his word
was very reliable.

1208
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,149
Got him locked up
in the schoolhouse.

1209
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,675
- I took the painting to show him -
- Drawing, if you don't mind.

1210
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,831
I took the drawing to show him.

1211
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,991
He almost fainted.
Said it was the same face.

1212
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,752
Where'd you paint it, Sam?

1213
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,594
From my vast subconscious.

1214
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,355
Sam, I hate to say this,
but I don't believe you.

1215
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,511
With all this talk,
I've lost interest in the game.

1216
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,830
If you'll forgive me,
I'll just run along home.

1217
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,036
I'll see you all tomorrow.

1218
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,195
What do you mean,
you don't believe me?

1219
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,992
What I mean, Sam...
I ain't educated in fancy art...

1220
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:13,914
but I do know the face of a dead
man when I see one, and this is it.

1221
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,675
Calvin, perhaps I can
educate you to, um, 'fancy art.'

1222
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,396
See this -
Portrait of a sleeping face.

1223
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,997
A man, relaxed,
far removed from earthly cares.

1224
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:31,073
It was conceived out of memory
and half-forgotten impulse,

1225
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,435
and it emerged from the shadows
of abstract emotions,

1226
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,591
until it was born full-grown from...

1227
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,556
the mechanical realities
of my fingertips.

1228
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,234
- Oh, now Sam, don't -
- I don't need a model to draw from.

1229
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,868
Instead of creating a sleeping face,
I could have...

1230
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,316
chosen an entirely different set
of artistic stimuli.

1231
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,234
My subconscious is peopled
with enough faces to cover the Earth.

1232
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,598
And the construction of the human
anatomy is so infinitely variable

1233
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,513
as to lie beyond the wildest powers
of calculation.

1234
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,559
Now, a raised eyelid, perhaps.

1235
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,438
A line of fullness to the cheek.

1236
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,514
Lip that bends with expression.

1237
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,152
There.

1238
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,393
- Sam, do you know what you just did?
- Certainly.

1239
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,518
I just showed you how clearly
you misinterpreted my art.

1240
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,477
You just destroyed legal evidence.

1241
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,549
Calvin, it appears to me
you still don't understand.

1242
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,439
I understand you made kind of a fool
out of me.

1243
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,990
But I still got enough evidence
to know something funny's going on.

1244
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,550
I ain't goin' to sleep
till I find out what it is.

1245
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,829
(Jennifer) Good night, Calvin.

1246
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,189
Hey! What's he doin' in our bathtub?

1247
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,355
- That's where frogs belong.
- (Arnie) Oh.

1248
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:01,637
- Back to bed, Arnie. Back to bed.
- State troopers here in the morning.

1249
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:05,156
I'm gonna want 'em to have a talk
with you, so be around.

1250
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,834
- (Whispering) I said back to bed.
- You can find me in my studio.

1251
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,833
Just make sure.
(Knocking At Door)

1252
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,797
Where is he?

1253
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,792
He... he's in the bathroom
playing with his frog.

1254
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,232
Oh?

1255
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,551
Um... This way, please, Doctor.

1256
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,671
It's Arnie. He's not very well.

1257
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,831
(Car Horn Honking)

1258
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,870
Someone must be foolin' around
with my car.

1259
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,630
What are you playin'
with the horn for? It ain't your car.

1260
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,394
Well, things are funny, you know?
(Chuckling)

1261
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,677
Me and Miss Gravely might be in the
car market. We're looking for a car.

1262
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,673
Yes. Had a look at this one.
It's a beauty.

1263
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,831
I want to keep it that way.

1264
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,037
Now, now, that's not the way
to talk to a prospective customer.

1265
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,432
You're no prospective customer.
You can't afford this car.

1266
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,351
He's gone.

1267
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,796
I put the little...
I put Arnie back to bed.

1268
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,554
- What'd the doctor say?
- He said for me to get out.

1269
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:32,508
I didn't like the look in his eye.
Something seems to be bothering him.

1270
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,509
Well, Captain,
did you get over being frightened?

1271
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,232
Frightened?

1272
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,632
(Chuckling)
Oh, no, that's not why I left. No.

1273
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,155
I'm not easily frightened,
you know. No.

1274
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,949
Why, after all those years sailing
the four corners of the globe,

1275
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,396
strange ports, a lot of rough men
and...

1276
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,834
Miss Gravely, what would you say...

1277
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,991
if I told you...

1278
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,879
I was only the captain
of a tugboat...

1279
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,031
on the East River...

1280
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:12,510
and never got more than a mile
or so off shore?

1281
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,149
Well, I would say that...

1282
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,880
that you were the handsomest
tugboat captain

1283
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,156
that ever sailed up the East River.

1284
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,833
Oh, maybe not. No. (Chuckling)

1285
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,673
You want to see something?
Here. Here.

1286
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,591
- Captain.
- Where'd you get those?

1287
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,469
Calvin Wiggs' car.

1288
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,710
I figured you were handling
half the evidence, Sammy,

1289
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,871
so it was up to me
to take care of the rest.

1290
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,792
You're the sweetest captain.

1291
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,838
Why is he in the bath?

1292
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,798
Well, uh...
What'd you find out, Doctor?

1293
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,873
Oh, that.
It was his heart. He had a seizure.

1294
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:01,510
- His heart?
- A seizure!

1295
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,671
Well, I'll take a trip
to the Philippines!

1296
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,559
- Death from natural causes.
- Well, certainly.

1297
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,595
But will somebody tell me what he's
doin' in the bathtub half undressed?

1298
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,149
Frankly, we didn't want
Calvin Wiggs to see him.

1299
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,669
Besides, he was awful dirty
after we dug him up.

1300
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,035
Dug him up?

1301
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,714
I'd better explain, Doctor, you see,

1302
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,678
Harry's been buried and dug up
on and off all day long.

1303
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,239
What?

1304
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,868
Finally, he caused so many
complications that

1305
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,191
we decided to clean him up
and put him back where we found him.

1306
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,590
I don't understand you.
What complications?

1307
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,391
Well, for example,

1308
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,438
he upset Captain Wiles because the
captain thought he had shot him.

1309
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,115
The hole in the head. But as it
turned out, it wasn't the captain.

1310
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,272
Miss Gravely hit him with the heel
of her shoe after he attacked her.

1311
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,950
Captain Wiles attacked Miss Gravely?

1312
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,112
Oh, no, Doctor, Harry.

1313
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,316
He dragged her into the bushes,
thinking it was me.

1314
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,515
He was dazed, I supposed, after I hit
him on the head with a milk bottle.

1315
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,716
(Sighing)

1316
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:09,073
The captain and Sam buried him first.

1317
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,754
(Giggles)
The captain was so scared.

1318
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,993
Then he accounted for all his
bullets, so up Harry came.

1319
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,310
Then Miss Gravely thought her shoe
was responsible for it so -

1320
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,471
- Shoe?
- So the captain,

1321
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:24,349
rather gallantly, I thought,
pushed him back in again.

1322
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,717
Then he was out and back and...
I can't remember why.

1323
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,633
But anyway, he's out again now
because Sam and I wanna get married.

1324
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:34,789
- Yeah. But why did you -
- Hit him on the head?

1325
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,950
That wouldn't interest you.
It's purely personal and non-medical.

1326
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,157
Besides, it's awfully late, so if
you'll keep quiet about all this,

1327
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,311
we'll put Harry back in the morning,
nice and clean,

1328
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,471
and no one will be any the wiser.

1329
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,631
And then we'll be rid of all these
sticky complications.

1330
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,268
Put him back, put him back,
that's all.

1331
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,115
This is the first nightmare
I've had in 25 years.

1332
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,231
He's kinda strange, isn't he?

1333
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,357
(Giggling)

1334
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,159
Well, um,
hadn't we better get Harry dressed?

1335
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,311
Yes, yes.

1336
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,352
Couldn't Arnie find him again?

1337
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,353
Then he'd run home and tell me,
and then I'd phone Calvin Wiggs.

1338
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,398
Yes! Arnie could explain
quite clearly to Calvin -

1339
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,235
- That he found Harry tomorrow.
- You mean today.

1340
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,198
But to Arnie, tomorrow is yesterday.

1341
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,472
Let's go get Harry. Come on, Captain.

1342
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,034
(Birds Chirping)

1343
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,231
Here he comes.

1344
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:13,951
Go on, Arnie.
Run home and tell me about it.

1345
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,111
Don't touch him.

1346
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,271
Please, Arnie, run home
and tell your mother.

1347
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:20,431
Beat it, you little creep!

1348
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,670
I mean, hurry home, son.

1349
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,070
Captain, you never told me
your first name.

1350
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,231
Albert. What's yours?

Ivy. Albert, let's go.

1352
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,355
Just a minute, ma'am.
I want to ask Sam something.

1353
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,433
Sam, what did you ask the millionaire
to bring you?

01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,831
(Chuckling)

1356
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,991
Albert, what was it?

1357
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,680
(Whispering) A double bed.
