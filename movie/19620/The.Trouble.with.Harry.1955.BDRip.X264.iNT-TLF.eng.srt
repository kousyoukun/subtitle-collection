1
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,650
Okay! I know how to handle your type!

2
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:57,033
Well, old faithful, that's your shooting for the day.

3
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,936
If we haven't rung up at least two rabbits,

4
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,529
we deserve to go home empty-handed.

5
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:07,237
Yeah. Still, blessed are they who expect nothing...

6
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,541
for they shall not be disappointed.

7
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:15,348
Mmm. Fewer things in life give a man more pleasure than hunting.

8
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:18,116
It satisfies his primitive nature...

9
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,523
striding through the woods, picking up his kill.

10
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:24,562
Well, come on, old faithful.

11
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:28,463
There's plump rabbits waiting for the frying pan.

12
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,920
If this can had four legs and a tail, we'd be eating it tonight.

13
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,989
Clean through the heart.

14
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,967
For rice cake, I've done him in.

15
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:40,630
Cor.

16
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:45,199
A harmless potshot at a rabbit and I'm a murderer... a killer.

17
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:48,246
Mother always said I'd come to a bad end.

18
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,840
What in Hades were you doing here anyway?

19
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:56,211
I can't say that I've seen you around here before.

20
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:00,247
No. If you're going to get yourself shot, do it where you're known.

21
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,895
"Mr. Harry Worp,

22
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,202
8 7 Maple Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts."

23
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,938
Well, Worp, you're a long way from home.

24
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,981
With the looks of it, you won't get back for Christmas. No.

25
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:28,447
We're going to have a cold, hard winter.

26
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,183
Mmm. You might keep here a long time... an awful long time.

27
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,418
Too long for me, Harry.

28
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,427
Yes.

29
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,339
Captain Wiles?

30
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,477
Yes, ma'am?

31
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,514
What seems to be the trouble, Captain?

32
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,283
Well, it's what you might call an unavoidable accident.

33
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,586
He's dead. Yes.

34
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:13,492
I would say that he was. Of course, that's an unprofessional opinion.

35
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:16,898
Yeah. Did you, uh... Did you know him, Miss Gravely?

36
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:20,335
No. Doesn't live around here?

37
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,398
Well, he died around here. That's what counts now. Embarrassing.

38
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:28,242
What do you plan to do with him, Captain?

39
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:33,649
Miss Gravely, without cutting the hem off truth garment,

40
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,778
I'm gonna hide him, cover him up,

41
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:39,949
forget him.

42
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,988
Are you never going to inform the police, Captain?

43
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,226
No. Forget you saw me, Miss Gravely.

44
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,268
Chase it out of your mind, for heaven's sake.

45
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,964
It was an accident. He was poking around the clearing...

46
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,097
and I thought he was a rabbit or something.

47
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:59,871
It was a human error. Ah, now, please, don't...

48
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:03,243
Don't say anything to anybody, Miss Gravely.

49
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,578
Do as you think best, Captain.

50
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,678
I'm sure you must have met many similar situations...

51
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,019
in your travels in foreign lands.

52
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,355
Yeah. I've seen much worse things.

53
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,395
I certainly won't say anything. Much worse things.

54
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,556
I remember when I was on the Orinoco.

55
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,599
We had a Turk, a great, big Turk there...

56
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,601
running amuck with a machete.

57
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:26,331
Captain, if I were going to hide an accident, I shouldn't delay.

58
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:31,206
Oh. Oh. You're right as rain, Miss Gravely.

59
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:35,006
Yes. You know something? I'm glad I met you today.

60
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:38,014
I feel better for telling somebody as warm,

61
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:42,519
tender, understanding as yourself.

62
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,751
Well, on the contrary, Captain. It...

63
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:52,161
It... I'm certainly glad if I helped you, Captain.

64
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,358
Perhaps you would care to come over for some blueberry muffins...

65
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,835
and coffee later on... high-bush blueberries?

66
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,430
Ah, well. This is certainly something of an interesting surprise.

67
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,202
And perhaps a touch of elderberry wine. Oh.

68
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:08,440
After all, we've been neighbors for nearly three years now...

69
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,515
and we've never exchanged social calls.

70
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:13,608
You're right. It's high time I paid a call.

71
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:17,553
What time? Oh, say, early this afternoon?

72
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:21,319
I'll be there with a clean shirt and a hungry face.

73
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:25,659
Do that. You better be going along now.

74
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,664
Don't want to be an accessory after the fact.

75
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:32,730
You are a considerate man, Capt. Wiles.

76
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,638
Good-bye. Good-bye.

77
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,788
Almost there, Mommy!

78
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,035
Here he is, Mommy. Here he is.

79
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,208
What did I tell ya, Mommy? Don't touch it, Arnie.

80
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,838
There he is. No. It can't be! Harry!

81
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:19,613
Harry. Thank Providence, the last of Harry.

82
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:23,313
- Who's Providence, Mommy? - A very good friend.

83
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,946
Don't you know who it is? You said Harry.

84
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:29,755
Can't you remember, Arnie? Why don't he get up and do something?

85
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:33,594
He's asleep. He's in a deep sleep...

86
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:37,533
A deep wonderful sleep...How did he heat his head?

87
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,934
Putting it where it wasn't wanted would be my guess.

88
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:42,939
- Will it get better? - Not if we're lucky.

89
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:47,236
Let's run home and I'll make you some lemonade.

90
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:50,837
Will lemonade put me in a wonderful, deep, deep sleep, Mommy?

91
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,680
- No, Arnie, but it's better than no lemonade. - I don't understand that.

92
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,846
Never mind. Now, you just forget you ever saw this man.

93
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,855
Is there a special way to forget?

94
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:02,358
Just think of something else. I think I'll try not to see him tomorrow, Mommy.

95
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:06,160
That's a good boy, Arnie. Now, let's run home and get that lemonade.

96
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,267
She won't care what I do with him.

97
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:29,787
Couldn't have had more people here if I'd sold tickets.

98
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:32,914
What's the big attraction, I wonder?

99
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,819
This could turn out to be the luckiest day of my life.

100
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:18,364
Might as well sit here till the rest of the world comes by to pay their last respects.

101
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:21,337
Sooner or later one of them has to turn out to be the deputy sheriff.

102
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,374
Flaggin'the train that's goin'home

103
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,073
Flaggin'the train to Tuscaloosa 

104
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:39,776
Never nO mOre, nO mOre tO rOam

105
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:43,953
Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa

106
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,650
Got a sweet gal who's on my mind

107
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,920
Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa

108
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:54,556
Back to the gal I left behind

109
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:57,396
Got no baggage

110
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,437
Just got my fare

111
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,971
But all I need yes, indeed

112
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,066
Is waitin'for me there

113
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,474
Flaggin'the train to Tuscaloosa

114
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,943
Oh how I love that choo-choo sound

115
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,278
Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa

116
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,083
Flaggin' the train that's homeward bound

117
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,903
Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa

118
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:36,406
Got a sweet gal who's on my mind

119
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,965
Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa

120
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:42,535
Back to the gal I left behind

121
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,679
Got no baggage

122
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,813
Just got my fare

123
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,085
But all I need yes, indeed

124
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:57,320
Is waitin' for me there

125
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,833
Hello, Mr. Marlow.

126
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,704
Wiggy. Wiggy. You haven't sold a painting.

127
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,834
All my pictures in the same place.

128
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,641
So few cars. They don't seem to...

129
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:18,045
I guess the cider takes their attention. Cider?

130
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:20,050
Cider, indeed. Throw it away! Drink it!

131
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:23,713
No, I hate cider. Not a picture sold.

132
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,813
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Marlow. Let's get a look at your new one.

133
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:29,724
- Hold it up. - What good would it do to show it to you?

134
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:32,025
You don't deserve to see it. How am I going to eat?

135
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,463
Mr. Wiggs always used to thump his stomach when he got mad.

136
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,592
He busted somethin' inside once.

137
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,740
You think we'd do any better on Fifth Avenue?

138
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:47,005
If there's more people there. Oh, lots of people.

139
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,137
Hundreds and thousands and billions of people.

140
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,239
Well, it might be better then. But what sort of people, Wiggy?

141
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,047
What breed? I'll tell you. They're little people...

142
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:59,282
little people with hats on.

143
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,258
How are your cigarettes?

144
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,236
Now I'll buy the other half tomorrow. 

145
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,706
What does your son do with all those old cars he always works on?

146
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:29,378
He sells 'em. Mechanical antiques. Doesn't make much, but he needs the money.

147
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,892
Hmm. Doesn't he get paid for being deputy sheriff?

148
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,895
Piecework. Gets paid by the arrest, I think.

149
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,558
Ah, Mr. Marlow. It's wonderful.

150
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:52,809
I've been in a tortured mood lately. What is it?

151
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,471
Good old Wiggy, my sternest critic.

152
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:58,014
Even if I don't understand your work, I think it's beautiful.

153
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:00,016
So does Mrs. Rogers.

154
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:02,518
Oh? You talk about me? Well, l...

155
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,679
She's the pretty woman with the little boy, isn't she?

156
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,747
Mm-hmm. I only brought up your name once...

157
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,349
when we were talking about strange people.

158
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,918
Huh? That is, strangers...

159
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,521
Oh. People she hadn't met yet.

160
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,157
And, uh, what does the pretty, little thing say about me?

161
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:21,467
Nothin'. I think we better discuss business.

162
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,939
Here... my shopping list.

163
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,237
I'll go in and start puttin' it up.

164
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,955
Say, Wiggy. How do you spell Tuscaloosa?

165
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:42,686
Sam?

166
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,853
Hi, Calvin. You hear any shootin' a while back?

167
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,693
- Nope. - Well, I did.

168
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,892
And there shouldn't be any shootin' around here. Why?

169
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,902
It's posted land, that's why.

170
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,906
Why's that? 'Cause I posted it.

171
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,171
What you got against people doing a little shooting now and then... let off a little steam?

172
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:01,871
Bullets and guns are dangerous they injuriously

173
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,143
No one around here could hit a freight car with a cannon.

174
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,916
I guess you're right, Sam. All the same, the law's the law.

175
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,151
And I got a good mind to scout around and find out who's doin' the shootin'...

176
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,419
and level a little fine.

177
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,427
And pick up a little piecework?

178
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:21,989
Well, if I can do anything to make it any harder for you, you let me know.

179
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,543
How'd you want your bacon, Mr. Marlow?

180
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:11,036
What were you saying? I asked how you want your bacon.

181
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,277
Sliced.

182
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,452
- Where is Calvin? - Off somewheres unimportant.

183
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,994
What a wonderful day.

184
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,396
So was yesterday, but you didn't say anything to me about it.

185
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:31,196
What you want Calvin for?

186
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:34,170
These marvelous pictures.

187
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:36,799
Someone told me they were yours.

188
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:39,968
Why don't you sell them, make a lot of money? Never thought of that.

189
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,978
I guess I'll just have to think about it. And that song...

190
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,607
You sing it so beautifully. You wrote it yourself, of course.

191
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,810
What do you want to borrow? Oh, dear.

192
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:51,048
I just think people need encouragement sometimes. Don't you, Mr. Marlow?

193
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:54,319
How'd you know my name? Well, it's on the pictures, isn't it?

194
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,326
It's not supposed to be readable.

195
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,624
Oh, you can tell it's not supposed to be. They're very professional.

196
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,891
Don't you think, Mrs. Wiggs?

197
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:04,957
Well, Miss Gravely, all I know is nobody buys them.

198
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:08,233
Thank you for yOur encouragement, Miss Gravely.

199
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,297
Well, now I wonder how you know my name?

200
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,707
Easy. Wiggy just said it. Wiggy.

201
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,335
What a perfectly ridiculous little nickname.

202
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,904
Do you mind if I call you Wiggy, Mrs. Wiggs?

203
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:22,247
Not if you pay all your bills on time. All right, Mr. Marlow.

204
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,917
Bacon, beans, cabbage, sugar, salt, tea, oleo margarine.

205
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:31,222
$ 1.95. Don't forget half a package of cigarettes.

206
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:34,355
Ah, yes. Ten cents... two five. That much?

207
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:40,396
I don't seem to be able to find the... I know, Mr. Marlow.

208
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,666
As soon as we sell some of your paintings.

209
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,476
Just a minute, Mr. Marlow. Well, let me make my position clear.

210
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,482
Shh.

211
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:06,660
- What do you think? - I think it'll hold coffee.

212
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:11,194
Will you try it, Mr. Marlow?

213
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:21,436
Put your finger through the handle, please.

214
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:29,309
How about the size? What about the handle?

215
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:32,220
Hmm? I mean, does it fit?

216
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,920
Is it the right finger size? It's my finger size.

217
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,535
- I'll take it. - Fifteen cents.

218
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,766
And the saucer? Ten.

219
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,831
That seems a fair price.

220
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,934
What's the finger size got to do with it?

221
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:58,914
Um, I wanted to be certain it would fit a man... a certain size man.

222
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,916
A man?

223
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:04,647
A certain somebody is coming over to my cottage this afternoon...

224
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:07,850
Not really? For coffee and blueberry muffins.

225
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,984
Why, you old social butterfly, you.

226
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,758
- Old? - That was figuratively speaking, Miss Gravely.

227
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:17,494
I think we've got a nearsighted cider customer.

228
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:20,093
How old do you think I am, yOung man?

229
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:25,040
Mmm. Fifty. How old do you think you are?

230
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:29,545
Forty-two. I can show you my birth certificate. I'm afraid you're gonna...

231
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:32,844
have to show more than your birth certificate to convince a man of that.

232
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,215
What do you mean? I mean you have to show your character,

233
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:39,279
the inner self, the hidden qualities,

234
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,417
the true Miss Gravely... sensitive, young in feeling,

235
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:45,291
timeless with love and understanding.

236
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,297
I can do it!

237
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,694
- At least, I think I can do it. - Do what?

238
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,703
Well, I think I'll just go out and see what that gentlemen wants.

239
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:57,002
At a time like this? Where are your scissors? Outside.

240
00:22:57,074 --> 00:23:00,566
- We're going to cut her hair. - Hair?

241
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:04,739
We'll cut it short, bring it up-to-date, make a nice, romantic styling,

242
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:07,181
take ten years off your birth certificate.

243
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,913
How are you fixed for ribbon? Should be some around somewhere.

244
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:12,182
Powder, rouge, lipstick? I think so.

245
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,952
Nothing cheap, shoddy or obvious.

246
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,427
Just youth, gentility, character.

247
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:20,794
I'll go out and get the scissors. You find the other things.

248
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,473
Ah, here they are. EXcuse me, young man. L...

249
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:42,918
Oh, well.

250
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,252
All right, Ernest. Let's go.

251
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,304
Well, always grow back, I guess.

252
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,909
There's Calvin. Is he alone?

253
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:16,885
Yep. Guess he didn't sell his car.

254
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:16,340
Hey! Would you mind getting out of my picture?

255
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:20,072
Next thing you know, they'll be televising the whole thing.

256
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:42,031
Huh.

257
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:48,738
This your body, little man?

258
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:52,298
Oh, don't turn me in. It was an accident... an accident pure and simple.

259
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,468
I thought he was a rabbit or a pheasant or something.

260
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:57,639
It could've happened to you. Suppose we straighten this whole thing out.

261
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,910
Well, I guess that's the only way out.

262
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:02,611
First thing I seen when I rolled out this morning...

263
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,851
was a double-breasted robin drunk as a hoot owl from eating fermented chokecherries.

264
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:09,859
Right away I knew somebody was in trouble.

265
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:13,192
What I didn't know was that it was me. 

266
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,631
Well, the larder was empty and I got to thinking about a tooth full of fried rabbit.

267
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,970
It stands to reason that they can't touch you for it.

268
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:23,529
Nothing these days stands to reason.

269
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,667
It was accidental. An act of God, perhaps.

270
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,910
In a way you should be grateful that you were able to do your share...

271
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:34,439
in accomplishing the destiny of a fellow being.

272
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:38,554
Suppose, for instance, it was written in the Book of Heaven...

273
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,556
that this man was to die...

274
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,627
at this particular time, at this particular place.

275
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:48,893
And suppose for a moment that the actual accomplishing of his departure had been bungled...

276
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,900
something had gone wrong.

277
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:53,664
Uh, perhaps it was meant to be a thunderbolt...

278
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:55,762
and there was no thunder available, say.

279
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:58,842
Well, then you come along, and you shoot him...

280
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:04,108
and heaven's will is done and destiny fulfilled.

281
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:07,275
Your conscience is quite clear. You've got nothing to worry about.

282
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,784
Sammy, I haven't got a conscience.

283
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,811
And it's not heaven that's worrying me...

284
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:14,016
because I don't expect I'll ever have to face it.

285
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:16,525
And it's none of those noble things you were talking about. No.

286
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,688
Nothing like that. Then what is it?

287
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,925
It's me. It's me that's worrying me...

288
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,934
me and my future life.

289
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:26,993
Oh, I know the police and their suspicious ways.

290
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:29,334
You're guilty until you're proved innocent.

291
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,601
And I want nothing more to do with them.

292
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,609
Bury him, I say, and have done with him.

293
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,839
He's no good to anyone now. Lay him to rest.

294
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:39,974
Put him under the sod. Forget him.

295
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,780
I never did it and you never saw him.

296
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:45,083
Yes. What about all those other people who saw him?

297
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:48,147
How about the woman and the little boy, Miss Gravely and the tramp...

298
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,887
and the man who was reading the book... Dr. Greenbow?

299
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:55,694
How about all of them? Well, nobody was interested, I tell you.

300
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,859
Nobody ever cared until you came along.

301
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:02,395
Ah, that's what you think. Suppose someone starts to care after you've buried him?

302
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:05,533
I can't wait for people to start caring whenever they feel like it.

303
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,134
I don't want a little accident to turn into a career.

304
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:11,214
Suppose that woman who called him Harry...

305
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:13,306
Suppose she decides she loves him after all.

306
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,912
She was downright hysterical with delight. Hmm? What was she like?

307
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:21,788
Pretty as a rainbow. Wish I was two years younger.

308
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:24,350
And with a little boy? Yeah, about four or five years of age.

309
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:27,362
Yeah. It's got to be Mrs. Rogers and her son.

310
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:30,433
Sammy, what do you say we slip him underground...

311
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:32,469
now that you've finished drawing him, eh?

312
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:34,733
We could discuss the smaller details later.

313
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:40,038
I don't like it. The authorities like to know when people die.

314
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,841
All right, Sammy. Forget it.

315
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:46,007
You cut off home.

316
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,449
I killed him and I'll look after his remains.

317
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,249
What'll you do? Drag him around the countryside the rest of the day?

318
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:55,553
Oh, I'll do my best. That's all a man can do.

319
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:58,527
If you're not careful, you will get a murder charge lined up.

320
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:00,859
Matter of fact, I'm beginning to suspect something myself.

321
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:04,731
There you are then. See? If you, an artist, suspect the worst,

322
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,293
what are they, the police, going to think?

323
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,828
What about that envelope with his name and address on it?

324
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:12,273
By rights, you should mail him back home.

325
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:18,212
Sam,have you forgot w these letters sent to the post office every night

326
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:21,342
Calvin Wiggs, deputy sheriff.

327
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:27,254
Oh, yes. You're right. I'll tell you what we'll do. Tell you what.

328
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:30,020
We'll find out how well Mrs. Rogers knows this man,

329
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,595
and whether she intends to notify the police of his death.

330
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:36,064
What good will that do? Why, a lot of good.

331
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,067
If she's just a distant friend of his...

332
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:41,434
and doesn't intend to notify the authorities,

333
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:44,268
then I, personally, will help you bury Harry.

334
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:48,277
Oh, Sammy! You've signed on for the cruise.

335
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:50,279
What time is it?

336
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,775
About noon. Good heavens.

337
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,286
I've got to go home and spruce up. I've got a date with Miss Gravely.

338
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:02,457
Not you. You are not the one.

339
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:07,362
Oh, Sam. She could do a lot worse, you know?

340
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:10,592
Couldn't do any better. Just think.

341
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:14,660
You'd be establishing a precedent. I'm not establishing nothing.

342
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:19,368
I am going over for some blueberry muffins and coffee by her own invitation,

343
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,578
and possibly some elderberry wine.

344
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,878
Do you realize that you'll be the first man to, uh,

345
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,085
cross her threshold?

346
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,751
Oh. Oh, it's not too late, you know. It's...

347
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:38,420
She's a well-preserved woman. I envy you.

348
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:40,986
Yes, very well-preserved.

349
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:44,694
And preserves have to be opened someday.

350
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,702
Hmm? Yes.

351
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,364
Now, you just trot down and see what Mrs. Rogers has to say.

352
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:52,806
How about hiding Harry first? Holy smoke!

353
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,004
Forgetting a little detail like that could hang a man.

354
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:58,013
Yes.

355
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:37,243
Oh. Oh, I beg your pardon.

356
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,663
I hope I never have to be operated on by Dr. Greenbow.

357
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:53,668
Come on. Let's get going. Yeah.

358
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:57,789
Good afternoon.

359
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:00,132
You're beautiful, wonderful.

360
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:03,035
You're the most wonderful, beautiful thing I've ever seen.

361
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,108
I'd like to paint you.

362
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:09,305
Was there something else you wanted, Mr. Marlow, isn't it?

363
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:14,647
You certainly are a lovely woman. I'd like to paint you nude.

364
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,651
Some other time, Mr. Marlow.

365
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:20,348
I was about to make Arnie some lemonade. Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

366
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:22,482
Perhaps I've come at an awkward moment.

367
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,357
If you want to undress me, you have.

368
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,362
Well, it wasn't exactly that.

369
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:31,525
I came here to talk to you about something, but after I saw you, it slipped my mind.

370
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:34,092
It couldn't have been very important then. Guess you're right.

371
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,573
Why don't you sit down on the porch?

372
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:40,006
I'll get you a lemonade and maybe you'll think of it.

373
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,409
You're not only beautiful, you're considerate too.

374
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:46,814
Arnie! Hello, Mr. Marlow!

375
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:48,817
Hi. What do you got? A rabbit?

376
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:52,013
Dead. What have you got?

377
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:57,322
Oh, I got me a little frog.

378
00:34:57,394 --> 00:35:00,522
There he is. It's hungry. It needs a mother.

379
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:08,996
I'll trade ya.

380
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:12,166
Your mother for mine? The rabbit for the frog.

381
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:17,771
It's yours, Arnie. I think you got the best deal.

382
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,816
Dead rabbits don't eat.

383
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,411
Well, I'll just take it in the kitchen and give him some lemonade.

384
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,825
Four rabbit's feet, and he got killed.

385
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:39,163
He should've carried a four-leaf clover too. And a horseshoe.

386
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:42,034
Say, how do rabbits get to be born?

387
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,041
Same way elephants do. Oh, sure.

388
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,771
How come you never came over to visit me before?

389
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:50,779
Didn't know you had such a pretty mother, Arnie.

390
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:54,874
If you think she's pretty, you should see my slingshot.

391
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:59,217
Hmm, perhaps I'll come back tomorrow. When's that?

392
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,884
The day after today. That's yesterday. Today's tomorrow.

393
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:07,623
It was. When was tomorrow yesterday, Mr. Marlow?

394
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:11,968
Today. Oh, sure. Yesterday.

395
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:14,903
You'll never make sense out of Arnie. He's got his own timing.

396
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,436
Thank you.

397
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:25,106
Lemonade, Arnie? I already swiped two glasses.

398
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:29,585
I would've given you two glasses. It's more fun swiped.

399
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:32,315
Can I borrow your rabbit, Mr. Marlow? Sure, Arnie.

400
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:34,323
What are you gonna do with it?

401
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:37,019
You never know when a dead rabbit might come in handy.

402
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,427
It already got me one frog.

403
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:51,306
Arnie! Where are you going now? To make some more trades!

404
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:54,605
Arnie, come home in time for supper. I'll try.

405
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,202
What's your given name?

406
00:36:57,314 --> 00:37:02,911
If you don't want to tell me, just make one up. Jennifer. Jennifer Rogers.

407
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:08,719
Nice. Um, who's the man up on the path?

408
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:11,989
What man? You know, Harry, the dead man.

409
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:17,056
Oh, him. That's my husband.

410
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,068
Your husband's dead then?

411
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:24,771
Is your lemonade sweet enough? Seems to be.

412
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:29,540
I like it tart. Harry is Arnie's father then?

413
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,875
No, Arnie's father's dead. So is Harry.

414
00:37:34,784 --> 00:37:37,685
Thank goodness. He was too good to live.

415
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:40,587
From his looks, he didn't appear to me to be the kind who was too good.

416
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:43,182
Well, he was. Horribly good.

417
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,754
I like your mouth too, especially when you say good.

418
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:54,733
Will you have some more lemonade? Maybe later. Thanks.

419
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:56,772
Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?

420
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,711
He found it. I think Capt. Wiles shot it.

421
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:05,871
I'd like to hear more of your life story, if you don't mind.

422
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:07,882
You see, we don't know quite what to do with Harry.

423
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:10,111
Thought you might have some suggestions.

424
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,553
Hmm. You can stuff him for all I care.

425
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:15,648
Stuff him and put him in a glass case,

426
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:18,592
only I'd suggest frosted glass.

427
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:23,198
What did he do to you, besides marry you?

428
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:29,905
Look, I've wanted to explain about Harry a lot of times,

429
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:35,239
But nobody would understand, least of all Harry.

430
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:41,816
But you... You've got an artistic mind. You can see the finer things.

431
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:44,944
When I'm lucky. Go on. Tell me everything.

432
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:48,616
Let it all out.

433
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:52,217
It was a long time ago and I was in love.

434
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,820
I was too much in love. What was his name?

435
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,831
Robert.

436
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,925
We'd agreed to overlook each other's families and everything and get married.

437
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:01,936
Did you? Oh, yes.

438
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:08,041
And then Robert got killed. Oh?

439
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:12,139
I was heartbroken for six weeks.

440
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,184
Then I discovered little Arnie was on the way.

441
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,653
Must have been a shock. Well, that's where Harry came in.

442
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:23,385
Harry the handsome hero. Harry the saint.

443
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,361
Harry the good. I didn't catch his last name.

444
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,364
Harry Worp, Robert's brother... his older brother.

445
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,366
And he fell in love with you?

446
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:34,437
If he'd have fallen in love with me, I wouldn't have minded.

447
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:38,031
He wanted to marry me because he was Robert's brother and felt noble.

448
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,633
But you thought he was in love with you?

449
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,578
And I decided to let him love me because of Arnie.

450
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:47,276
It was on my second wedding night that I learned the truth.

451
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,948
You didn't learn on your first?

452
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:57,289
This was a terrible truth...

453
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:00,727
the truth about Harry. Just what happened?

454
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:06,124
- How old are you, Mr. Marlow? - About thirty.

455
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:13,167
This is what happened.

456
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:18,010
I was in the hotel room alone. I put on my best nightie.

457
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:20,548
- You understand? - Perfectly.

458
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,444
Although I had no true feeling for Harry,

459
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:28,719
I had worked myself into a certain enthusiasm because I thought he loved me.

460
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,725
Must have been hard work.

461
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:34,892
There was a full moon, and I sat by the window...

462
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:37,990
because I thought it would show off my new nightie to advantage.

463
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:43,734
- Naturally. - I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

464
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,172
You a perfect stranger too. I'm not boring you, am I?

465
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:49,578
No. No. Not at all.

466
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,374
How about some more lemonade? Uh, soon. Soon.

467
00:40:56,286 --> 00:41:00,245
Oh, where was I? You were sitting by the window because there was a full moon,

468
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,917
and you'd worked yourself up to a certain enthusiasm.

469
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:06,257
I said all that?

470
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,491
Uh, when does Harry come in?

471
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,467
He doesn't. He never came in.

472
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:16,699
He called the following morning. The following morning?

473
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,867
In the hotel lobby the night before, he had bought a magazine.

474
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:22,035
- His horoscope was in it. - Bad?

475
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,411
It said... He was a Taurus.

476
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:28,474
It said, "Don't start any new project that day.

477
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:30,917
It could never be finished."

478
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:35,253
And what did you do? I left him on the spot, and went home to Mother's.

479
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:39,523
- The end. - What a poignant story.

480
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:44,124
I knew you'd understand. Nobody else does. Not even Mother?

481
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,033
Well, she thought I should live with him, but I wouldn't.

482
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:50,664
He pestered me to go back, but I always refused.

483
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,198
Well, suppose some night I wanted him to do something...

484
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,938
like the dishes, for example.

485
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:59,072
His horoscope just wouldn't let him.

486
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:04,018
You're absolutely right. There are some things I just don't like to do by myself.

487
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:07,648
And no one with any true understanding would blame you for it.

488
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:13,653
As soon as Arnie was born, I moved away to where I thought Harry could never find me.

489
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,324
I changed my name and...

490
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,334
But he was persistent?

491
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,836
This morning there was a knock on the door.

492
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:24,669
Before I opened it, I knew he was standing on the other side.

493
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:30,202
What did he want? Me! He wanted me because I was his wife.

494
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,239
He wanted me because, as he put it, he suddenly felt some basic urge

495
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:36,275
loneliness. What'd you feel?

496
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:40,618
I felt sick. Did you see his mustache and his wavy hair?

497
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,658
Yeah, but when I saw him, he was dead.

498
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:46,321
Yeah, he looked exactly the same when he was alive, except he was vertical.

499
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:49,422
So he entered. What'd you say? Nothing.

500
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:52,024
I hit him over the head with a milk bottle and knocked him silly.

501
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:56,834
- Silly? - Bats. Tappy.

502
00:42:56,906 --> 00:43:00,034
He went staggering up towards the woods saying he was gonna find his wife...

503
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:01,974
and drag her home if it killed him.

504
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:04,171
Apparently it did.

505
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:10,246
Have some more lemonade.

506
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:55,188
Why, Capt. Wiles. What a surprise.

507
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,733
But you invited me, Miss Gravely.

508
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,634
At least that's how I remember it. Of course I did, Captain.

509
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:03,638
But somehow, it's still a surprise.

510
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,574
Oh, yes. You certainly know how to make a man feel wanted.

511
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,669
Won't you come in, Captain?

512
00:44:09,746 --> 00:44:13,705
Oh, thank you. I've-I've looked forward to it.

513
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:32,826
Takes a real cook to make a good blueberry muffin...

514
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,870
to keep the blueberries from sitting on the bottom.

515
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:38,362
High-bush blueberries. That's the secret.

516
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:43,539
I picked 'em up near where you shot that unfortunate man.

517
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:51,279
A real handsome man's cup.

518
00:44:52,388 --> 00:44:54,948
It's been in the family for years.

519
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:57,822
My father always used it up until he died.

520
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:04,792
I trust he died peacefully... slipped away in the night.

521
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:07,802
He was caught in a threshing machine.

522
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:13,735
Hope I haven't distressed you, Captain. Oh, not at all, Miss Gravely.

523
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:17,835
Not at all. I'm used to looking on the rough side of things.

524
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:20,142
I am man who's faced death many times.

525
00:45:21,249 --> 00:45:24,707
- Rather recently too. - Yeah.

526
00:45:29,757 --> 00:45:33,386
- Arnie. What are you carrying there? - A rabbit.

527
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:35,656
A rabbit?

528
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:40,729
- What do you call it? - Dead. It ain't mine.

529
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:44,327
Well, whose is it? Yours. You shot it with your gun.

530
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:46,430
You must've killed it today.

531
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,634
- It should make a nice stew for ya. - A rabbit!

532
00:45:48,743 --> 00:45:51,576
I finally killed a rabbit! Where did you find it?

533
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:53,580
In the blueberry muffins.

534
00:45:53,648 --> 00:45:56,913
- What? - Out in the woods.

535
00:45:56,984 --> 00:46:00,750
Oh, here you are. One muffin for one rabbit. Fair enough?

536
00:46:00,855 --> 00:46:02,686
That was a two-muffin rabbit.

537
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:07,250
- I gotta go now. - Oh.

538
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,072
Hmm.

539
00:46:19,807 --> 00:46:24,608
It's, uh, certainly a nice afternoon, Miss Gravely.

540
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:27,580
Isn't it? Mmm.

541
00:46:27,682 --> 00:46:31,641
Yes, and you're... You're a nice woman.

542
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:35,211
And I think you're awfully nice, Capt. Wiles.

543
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:40,591
Um, um. Let's get back to our little problem Harry.

544
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:43,960
What's going to become of him? Oh, now, now. Don't you worry about Harry.

545
00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:46,329
He'll be comfortably underground before nightfall.

546
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:51,100
All that digging and work. Couldn't you just...

547
00:46:51,205 --> 00:46:54,106
let him slide off the end of your boat pier into the pond?

548
00:46:56,411 --> 00:46:59,437
And have him pop up like a cork? No, sir.

549
00:46:59,514 --> 00:47:01,914
Nobody ever popped up from under four feet of ground.

550
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:05,645
No. Besides, they'll be cutting ice there this winter.

551
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,655
Now wouldn't it be a nice thing if they were cutting blocks of ice and...

552
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:11,624
Never mind, Captain. You're right.

553
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:15,860
Yes. Underground is the best place for Harry.

554
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,817
He seems comfortable, Sam, very comfortable and snug.

555
00:47:45,893 --> 00:47:48,418
We better find a place and get it dug and the sooner the better.

556
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:51,294
If what you're telling me about Mrs. Rogers and her husband is right,

557
00:47:51,365 --> 00:47:53,356
I agree with you, Sammy.

558
00:47:53,401 --> 00:47:55,869
Well, let's find a place.

559
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,870
No use making hard work out of it.

560
00:47:57,972 --> 00:47:59,872
We need a place where the earth is soft.

561
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:03,535
Yeah, and a place where the whole town won't stumble over us as we work.

562
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:07,570
Mmm. A place with a certain character and attractiveness.

563
00:48:07,615 --> 00:48:10,914
Facing west so that Harry can watch the setting sun.

564
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:14,113
Where it'll be cozy in winter. And cool in the summer.

565
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:17,783
You know, I'm half envying Harry.

566
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:20,861
It wouldn't take much longer to dig it twice as wide.

567
00:48:20,928 --> 00:48:23,726
Well, thanks for your kindness, but some other time.

568
00:48:29,337 --> 00:48:32,238
Here. This looks like a good place. Ah.

569
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:34,570
You're a lucky fellow, Harry Worp.

570
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:42,910
Come on, Captain. Off with your coat. What, me?

571
00:48:43,017 --> 00:48:44,917
Certainly you. It's your body, isn't it?

572
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:47,180
Oh, I'm not much of a hand at grave digging.

573
00:48:47,255 --> 00:48:50,486
You should've thought of that before you went hunting this morning.

574
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:56,959
Calvin Wiggs. What'll we do now?

575
00:48:57,031 --> 00:48:59,329
Think up the best story he's ever heard.

576
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:27,757
Lay down your shovel, Sam. What's the trouble?

577
00:49:27,862 --> 00:49:32,822
- I'm dead beat. - Good. I was dead beat ten minutes ago.

578
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,494
I wanted to keep digging until you gave up.

579
00:49:42,076 --> 00:49:44,977
Gives me the creeps. Yeah?

580
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:47,708
Come on. Let's get Harry and pop him in.

581
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:56,490
With hasty reverence.

582
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:08,459
Would you like to say a few words, Captain? That I would.

583
00:50:08,535 --> 00:50:11,902
Harry Worp, don't ever show your face around here again!

584
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,306
Let's finish this job and get out of here.

585
00:50:19,413 --> 00:50:23,247
Captain, I think Calvin Wiggs is looking for something.

586
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:25,251
Do you suppose he knows that Harry Worp came up here?

587
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,516
Sammy, that's as horrible a thought as you've ever had.

588
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:30,852
And that he wonders what happened to Harry or where he is?

589
00:50:30,924 --> 00:50:35,725
My only answer is to keep on scraping, and fast.

590
00:50:35,762 --> 00:50:39,721
You know if, if you must kill things from now on, I wish you'd stick to rabbits.

591
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:42,667
The body's smaller. Rabbits! I didn't tell you, did I, Sammy?

592
00:50:42,736 --> 00:50:47,230
I shot a rabbit today! Don't shout. I know you did.

593
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:50,242
I was up at Jennifer Rogers' when Arnie showed me the rabbit.

594
00:50:50,277 --> 00:50:53,974
Jennifer, eh? Didn't waste much time, did you?

595
00:50:54,047 --> 00:50:55,981
Well, I don't blame you, Sammy.

596
00:50:56,049 --> 00:50:58,643
A very nice widow she'll make. Very nice.

597
00:50:58,752 --> 00:51:00,947
Let's discuss her when we've finished with Harry, huh?

598
00:51:01,054 --> 00:51:03,750
No need to get huffy. I don't want to talk about your affairs.

599
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:06,257
I've got affairs of my own.

600
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:08,261
You mean my protege?

601
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:10,559
Come again? Miss Gravely.

602
00:51:10,664 --> 00:51:13,861
The lady that I renovated down at Mrs. Wiggs' this afternoon.

603
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:16,868
A most remarkable reversion to femininity.

604
00:51:16,904 --> 00:51:19,304
I don't quite get you, Sammy boy.

605
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:21,898
She came into the Emporium in rather high excitement.

606
00:51:21,975 --> 00:51:25,172
Wanted a new cup and saucer, lots of other things.

607
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:28,578
I gave her a new makeup and hairdo.

608
00:51:28,682 --> 00:51:30,946
Don't tell me you didn't notice.

609
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:34,146
She's a very nice lady, Sam. Very nice.

610
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:37,816
We're all nice. I don't see how anyone could help but like us.

611
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:40,086
That's just how I feel today.

612
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:42,526
I don't know whether I've grown rose-colored glasses or if...

613
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:44,530
Or, uh, if you're in love?

614
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:46,725
Aha! 

615
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,928
There's nothing like finding yourself in love.

616
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:52,494
No, it adds zest to your work.

617
00:51:52,606 --> 00:51:55,006
Zest! Zest!

618
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:58,239
I think I've had enough zest for a while.

619
00:51:58,312 --> 00:52:02,339
Let's sit down and rest, huh? Why not? We've earned it.

620
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,422
Tell me, Sam, what did Jennifer think of my shooting?

621
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:12,424
You mean Mrs. Rogers? Oh, I think by now...

622
00:52:12,526 --> 00:52:14,756
I'm entitled to be on a first-name basis with her.

623
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:17,626
After all, I brought her a happy release with one bullet.

624
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:20,666
One bullet? How 'bout that "No Shooting" sign that I found?

625
00:52:20,734 --> 00:52:23,726
Well, that. One bullet for the "No Shooting" sign,

626
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,671
one for the beer can and one for Harry.

627
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,436
How about the rabbit? And one for the ra...

628
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:36,349
What's the matter?

629
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,350
What's wrong? What's bitten you?

630
00:52:38,452 --> 00:52:41,012
I only fired three bullets. Three!

631
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:43,750
One for the shooting sign, one for the beer can...

632
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:46,052
And one for the little man who's lying in the grave.

633
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,753
No, Sammy, no. That's just it. One for the rabbit.

634
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:51,262
If I shot the rabbit, I didn't shoot Harry.

635
00:52:51,298 --> 00:52:54,267
Oh, Sammy boy, what have you tried to make me do?

636
00:52:54,368 --> 00:52:56,268
Tried to make a murderer out of me.

637
00:52:58,472 --> 00:53:02,602
Well, don't sit there. Help me! You helped bury him.

638
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:05,042
Even if you didn't kill him, why go digging him up...

639
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:07,205
now that he's so beautifully planted?

640
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,875
I've promised Jennifer that we'd bury him.

641
00:53:09,983 --> 00:53:12,952
Keep my word, he should stay buried.

642
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,853
Besides whether you killed him or not, you've incriminated yourself.

643
00:53:15,922 --> 00:53:20,291
You'll have more of a job explaining away a body you didn't kill and buried...

644
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:23,296
than a body that you killed accidentally and buried.

645
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,231
Right, Captain?

646
00:53:29,903 --> 00:53:32,303
You're not supposed to bury bodies whenever you find them.

647
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:34,306
It makes people suspicious.

648
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:36,876
Supposed to tell the police or advertise or something.

649
00:53:36,943 --> 00:53:40,902
Oh, Sammy, you don't understand. You don't comprehend one bit.

650
00:53:41,014 --> 00:53:44,313
You wouldn't like me to go through my life not knowing if I killed him or not, would you?

651
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,147
Very inconsistent.

652
00:53:49,222 --> 00:53:51,247
First you tell me you've got no conscience.

653
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:53,987
Now you talk about something that sounds remarkably like a conscience.

654
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:56,052
Oh, Sammy, come on. Help me.

655
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:59,257
I don't care if I killed him or not, for all that matters.

656
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:04,293
But I'll get the shakes whenever I see a policeman, and it's no good saying I won't.

657
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:06,339
All right.

658
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,035
If I had my choice, I'd rather be thought a murderer than proved one.

659
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:14,375
With two of us digging, we'll have Harry out of here in nothing flat.

660
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:24,280
Can't see much from here.

661
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:26,383
I'd better get in down there and look at him.

662
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,123
Let me do the honors. All right. You've got good eyes.

663
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:35,228
Hey. That isn't a bullet wound.

664
00:54:35,302 --> 00:54:37,361
"Isn't a bullet wound"? No.

665
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:39,371
What d'ya know?

666
00:54:39,473 --> 00:54:42,203
That's what they call a blow with a blunt instrument.

667
00:54:42,275 --> 00:54:44,971
Huh? What are you thinking, Sammy?

668
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,807
I think, Capt. Wiles, we're tangled up in a murder.

669
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:54,786
Murder. If it's murder, who done it?

670
00:54:54,888 --> 00:54:58,551
- Who "did" it? - That's what I say Who done it?

671
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:02,152
Apart from Jennifer Rogers, who else'd want to kill him?

672
00:55:03,597 --> 00:55:05,497
"Apart from Jennifer"?

673
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,499
Yeah. Do you think that she would...

674
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:09,501
Oh, it's ridiculous.

675
00:55:09,603 --> 00:55:12,094
You said she was surprised to see the body when she came up here.

676
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:14,730
You said she hit him on the head.

677
00:55:14,808 --> 00:55:17,299
Coming home from Madagascar once, we had a fireman on board...

678
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:20,141
who hit his head on a brick wall and died two days later.

679
00:55:20,213 --> 00:55:22,647
Where could he find a brick wall on board a ship?

680
00:55:22,716 --> 00:55:25,708
That's what we always wondered.

681
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,715
Couldn't have been Jennifer. No.

682
00:55:30,824 --> 00:55:33,156
Besides, what's it matter who did it?

683
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:35,660
It'll be better for all of us if he's buried and out of the way.

684
00:55:35,729 --> 00:55:39,631
Nothing doing. I'm not burying someone else's bad habits.

685
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:42,191
Hmm? Suppose it was Miss Gravely?

686
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:45,568
What? 

687
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:48,130
No, it's not as funny as all that.

688
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:50,573
You said yourself she wasn't particularly startled...

689
00:55:50,644 --> 00:55:52,578
to see you dragging Harry up the path.

690
00:55:52,646 --> 00:55:55,740
You artists have got no idea of etiquette.

691
00:55:55,849 --> 00:55:58,317
Miss Gravely is a lady of gentle habits and upbringing.

692
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:01,354
A lady to hide her feelings. If I hadn't been holding Harry by the ankles,

693
00:56:01,455 --> 00:56:03,548
I don't suppose she'd have mentioned him at all.

694
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:06,888
- Really? - Nah! When she said,

695
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,451
"What seems to be the trouble, Captain?"

696
00:56:09,563 --> 00:56:11,963
It was nothing more than a pleasantry, so to speak.

697
00:56:12,065 --> 00:56:16,092
Like, "Nice day, isn't it?" "I'm sure, yes."

698
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:18,103
Or something like that.

699
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:20,571
Going to help me bury him again?

700
00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:24,303
Um... I don't know.

701
00:56:24,377 --> 00:56:27,778
'Course, it might have been Dr. Greenbow or the tramp or...

702
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:32,079
OrJennifer? I told you it couldn't...

703
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:35,586
Well, no point in arguing about it. Let's get rid of him.

704
00:56:37,591 --> 00:56:42,494
All right. You've helped me in my hour of need. I guess it's up to me to help you.

705
00:56:42,596 --> 00:56:45,360
We'll file Harry away once and for all. Yeah.

706
00:56:45,432 --> 00:56:47,400
No more nonsense about it.

707
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:16,024
Come aboard, Miss Gravely, come aboard.

708
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:18,791
It's just an old salt's snug anchorage.

709
00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:22,596
Small, not palatial like yours. But homely, very home...

710
00:57:38,552 --> 00:57:40,543
Won't you sit down, Miss Gravely?

711
00:57:40,654 --> 00:57:42,554
Thank you.

712
00:57:44,758 --> 00:57:49,718
It's funny, you know. Funny how we got to be so friendly in one afternoon.

713
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:53,961
I knew you weren't as prim and starchy as they made out.

714
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:56,035
Not by a long shot.

715
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:58,070
Really? NO.

716
00:57:58,104 --> 00:58:01,232
I'm a man who can recognize the human qualities in a woman.

717
00:58:01,308 --> 00:58:03,708
When I first saw you down where Harry was...

718
00:58:03,777 --> 00:58:06,075
Capt. Wiles. Yes, ma'am?

719
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:09,342
Before you make your kind thoughts known to me, I...

720
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:13,113
should like to offer you some explanation of my sudden invitation...

721
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:15,916
to coffee and blueberry muffins this afternoon...

722
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:19,152
and my... and my sitting with you here now.

723
00:58:19,225 --> 00:58:21,386
No, ma'am, you don't have to explain anything.

724
00:58:21,494 --> 00:58:25,555
You came to my aid at a moment of crisis, for which I'm truly grateful.

725
00:58:25,632 --> 00:58:29,932
Thank you, but it's just that I owe you some reason.

726
00:58:30,003 --> 00:58:32,437
No, no, no. I won't hear a word of it.

727
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:35,906
You saw the predicament I was in with that body on my hands and all,

728
00:58:35,942 --> 00:58:39,605
and you shut your eyes to it in a most sporting fashion, if I may say so.

729
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:42,011
Capt. Wiles. Yes, ma'am?

730
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:46,074
I'm trying to tell you that the reason I asked you to coffee and blueberry muffins...

731
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:48,620
was because... I felt...

732
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:50,850
Sympathy. Gratitude.

733
00:58:50,924 --> 00:58:53,859
Gra... But I'm the one who should be grateful.

734
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:58,887
No, I was grateful. L... I am grateful.

735
00:58:58,932 --> 00:59:03,062
I'm grateful to you for burying my body.

736
00:59:08,341 --> 00:59:10,275
Your body?

737
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:12,937
The man you thought you killed...

738
00:59:13,046 --> 00:59:17,449
was the man I hit over the head with the leather heel of my hiking shoe.

739
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:19,748
You?

740
00:59:19,853 --> 00:59:23,050
- And with a metal cleat on the end of it. - But why?

741
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,892
He annoyed me.

742
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,554
I was walking towards home when he...

743
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,154
suddenly came at me with a wild look in his eye...

744
00:59:32,265 --> 00:59:35,393
and insisted... we were married.

745
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:37,766
Oh, then you'd known each other before.

746
00:59:37,871 --> 00:59:40,897
Believe it or not, I had never seen him before in my life,

747
00:59:40,974 --> 00:59:44,910
and... if I ever had, I never would have married him.

748
00:59:44,978 --> 00:59:47,469
He must have mistaken you for someone else.

749
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:51,516
No, he definitely... pulled me into the bushes.

750
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:53,677
Yes?

751
00:59:53,787 --> 00:59:57,951
- I came out again. - Go on.

752
00:59:58,024 --> 01:00:01,585
He pulled me back.

753
01:00:01,695 --> 01:00:03,595
Twice.

754
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:07,189
He swore at me... horrible, masculine sounds.

755
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,200
I didn't understand them, of course.

756
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:12,271
Of course you didn't.

757
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:14,863
- We fought. - Then what?

758
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:21,269
I won. My shoe had come off in the struggle, and I hit him.

759
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:24,874
I hit him as hard as ever I could.

760
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:30,022
You killed him.

761
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:35,622
I must have done it. I was annoyed, Captain.

762
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,958
Very annoyed. Naturally.

763
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:42,297
I don't think I've ever been so annoyed.

764
01:00:42,368 --> 01:00:47,237
Consequently, I, I didn't realize my own capabilities.

765
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,673
Whew! Seems to me...

766
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:53,736
Mrs. Rogers knocked him silly, and you finished him off.

767
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:56,816
Why should Mrs. Rogers knock him silly?

768
01:00:56,883 --> 01:00:59,215
She was really his wife.

769
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:03,881
Poor woman. I thought she had better taste.

770
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:07,492
You know, Captain,

771
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,553
when I ran away I decided I would never tell a soul what happened.

772
01:01:11,664 --> 01:01:14,258
Then I met you, and I thought...

773
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:19,669
how convenient it was that you should think that you had shot him.

774
01:01:19,773 --> 01:01:23,106
- You must forgive me for thinking that. - Only natural.

775
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:27,806
That's why I felt... I still feel under an obligation to you.

776
01:01:27,881 --> 01:01:30,782
Oh, not at all. Let's forget it.

777
01:01:30,884 --> 01:01:34,718
No, we mustn't do that. It would hardly be fair to you...

778
01:01:34,788 --> 01:01:39,782
I mean, for you to go through life knowing that you had buried a man you didn't kill.

779
01:01:39,893 --> 01:01:42,361
You would have my crime on your conscience.

780
01:01:42,428 --> 01:01:45,397
It's a pleasure, I'm sure.

781
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:47,558
But no.

782
01:01:47,634 --> 01:01:51,593
Now I realize that Harry man was out of his mind, and...

783
01:01:51,638 --> 01:01:54,300
my action was justifiable,

784
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:57,376
there's no reason we shouldn't let the authorities know about it.

785
01:01:57,443 --> 01:02:01,004
The authorities? Then everything will be cleared up nicely.

786
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:03,912
I'm sure Calvin Wiggs and the police...

787
01:02:04,017 --> 01:02:06,542
won't make a fuss about it when we explain.

788
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:09,918
Perhaps it needn't get into the papers at all. Don't you believe it, ma'am.

789
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:12,355
They love it, the papers, this kind of thing.

790
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:14,916
Murder and passion.

791
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:17,622
You let Harry be. Just forget it ever happened,

792
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,530
the same as Sammy and me and Jennifer Rogers are going to do.

793
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:26,230
Oh, but... but it isn't your body.

794
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:30,833
After all, I killed him, so it's only fair that I should have the say-so.

795
01:02:30,944 --> 01:02:33,037
Yes, but... Well, in a way... DOn't yOu agree?

796
01:02:33,146 --> 01:02:36,638
I thought you would. I tell you what, Captain.

797
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:42,154
We'll go and get a spade now. But, ma'am...

798
01:02:42,188 --> 01:02:45,055
And after we've dug him up, we'll go back to my place...

799
01:02:45,158 --> 01:02:47,592
and I'll make you some hot chocolate.

800
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:31,600
Arnie's so tired he'll sleep all day and half the night.

801
01:03:31,704 --> 01:03:34,332
I think you've got a pretty house,Jennifer.

802
01:03:34,407 --> 01:03:37,706
It's the best I could do on Robert's insurance.

803
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,074
Sugar? No, black, thanks.

804
01:03:50,657 --> 01:03:52,625
It's funny, but...

805
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:56,117
I feel awful comfortable with you, Sam.

806
01:03:58,364 --> 01:04:00,855
You know, I feel the same way too.

807
01:04:00,934 --> 01:04:02,925
It's a good feeling,

808
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:06,437
feeling comfortable with someone who feels that way too.

809
01:04:10,443 --> 01:04:12,934
There is one thing I feel uncomfortable about.

810
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:16,379
Tell me what it is, and I'll take care of it for you.

811
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:18,383
It's Harry? What about Harry?

812
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:21,215
Harry? Don't you think about Harry.

813
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:24,552
Harry's part of the earth. He's with eternity, the ages.

814
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:26,852
Take my word for it. Harry's ancient history.

815
01:04:28,962 --> 01:04:31,123
Come in, whoever it is.

816
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,568
What happened?

817
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:39,137
Sam, I've got Something to tell you.

818
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:42,766
No, Captain, I have something to tell him.

819
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:45,275
Now who's going to tell what?

820
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:51,214
I killed Harry Worp with the leather heel of my hiking shoe.

821
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:57,652
- So it was you. - We're on our way to get Calvin Wiggs,

822
01:04:57,724 --> 01:05:01,057
and have him call the state police. I keep telling her there's no need.

823
01:05:01,127 --> 01:05:05,291
He's right and, uh, besides, it'd be indecent. Harry's dead and buried.

824
01:05:05,398 --> 01:05:07,593
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

825
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:10,735
You haven't dug him up again.

826
01:05:10,803 --> 01:05:12,896
Well, l...

827
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:22,112
I insisted, Mr. Marlow.

828
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:24,547
Don't you understand?

829
01:05:24,617 --> 01:05:28,917
You have nothing to fear. It's my concern entirely.

830
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:33,322
As soon as Capt. Wiles told me the full circumstances of his being here,

831
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,327
I knew there was nothing for me to hide.

832
01:05:35,361 --> 01:05:37,522
You know all about Harry?

833
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,030
I'm afraid I do, Mrs. Rogers, and...

834
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:43,866
and after all, nobody could possibly gossip about a lady and a maniac.

835
01:05:43,936 --> 01:05:45,870
You'd be surprised.

836
01:05:45,938 --> 01:05:48,839
You don't quite understand what murder involves, Miss Gravely.

837
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,469
It'd be hours and hours of questioning and photographs,

838
01:05:51,544 --> 01:05:54,536
and the whole of your private life spread indecently in the newspapers.

839
01:05:56,849 --> 01:06:00,046
What makes you think my private life is indecent?

840
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:03,281
I didn't mean that. I meant that the way they pry is indecent.

841
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:08,020
They'll hound you to death. There'll be newspapermen, photographers, detectives.

842
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:11,325
- I've made up my mind. - She certainly has.

843
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:14,195
It was Capt. Wiles here who persuaded me to call...

844
01:06:14,267 --> 01:06:17,327
and tell Mrs. Rogers what I proposed to do.

845
01:06:17,403 --> 01:06:21,499
After all, she is most closely connected with the business.

846
01:06:21,574 --> 01:06:24,407
What do you think about it, Mrs. Rogers?

847
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:27,469
I can't see why you're all making such a fuss about Harry.

848
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:31,141
If he was buried, I don't see why you had to dig him up.

849
01:06:31,217 --> 01:06:34,482
But since you have, I guess you'd better do what you think best.

850
01:06:34,587 --> 01:06:38,023
I don't care what you do with Harry, as long as you don't bring him back to life.

851
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:43,219
- I have a free hand, then. - Free as a bird.

852
01:06:43,296 --> 01:06:45,730
As far as I'm concerned, it's ancient history.

853
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:47,959
Wait a minute,Jennifer.

854
01:06:48,034 --> 01:06:50,366
I think we've forgotten something.

855
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:53,530
Do you realize if this thing comes out, that all the details of your marriage...

856
01:06:53,606 --> 01:06:55,801
will be public property?

857
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:02,411
- Oh. - I must confess, I hadn't thought of that, either.

858
01:07:02,515 --> 01:07:06,144
- Where'd you put Harry this time? - Over by the big oak tree.

859
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:08,312
I'll get my shovel.

860
01:07:08,421 --> 01:07:11,049
I'm afraid I'm causing you rather a lot of hard work.

861
01:07:11,124 --> 01:07:13,115
I'm sorry. Not at all, not at all.

862
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:16,128
Well, let's all go up there.

863
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,590
You know, I've never been to a homemade funeral before.

864
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:24,193
I have.

865
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,000
This is my third.

866
01:07:27,073 --> 01:07:29,405
All in one day.

867
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:39,139
Well, let's get it over with.

868
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:41,153
Yes.

869
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,394
I think we ought to cement it over.

870
01:07:55,468 --> 01:07:58,926
Next spring I'll set out some blueberry bushes.

871
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:01,735
Couldn't you make it something else? Lilacs maybe?

872
01:08:01,807 --> 01:08:03,775
I think nature'll take good care of it.

873
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:07,768
How about a little service? I can't think of anything to say.

874
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,974
Besides, my arms ache. It's too late to say prayers.

875
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:14,382
Besides, wherever he was going, he's there now.

876
01:08:14,487 --> 01:08:16,546
Bye, Harry. I forgive you.

877
01:08:25,298 --> 01:08:27,698
Trumpets welcoming Harry.

878
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,201
You didn't know Harry. I'd like to paint you like that,Jennifer.

879
01:08:31,237 --> 01:08:33,467
You look beautiful, glistening in the moonlight.

880
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:37,509
Sounds as if it's coming down from near the village.

881
01:08:37,543 --> 01:08:39,511
I know what it is.

882
01:08:39,545 --> 01:08:41,536
It's the call of the phantom stagecoach...

883
01:08:41,614 --> 01:08:46,017
that used to pass by here each night 2OO years ago. Phantom coach?

884
01:08:46,118 --> 01:08:49,315
The old turnpike used to run across those foothills over there.

885
01:08:49,422 --> 01:08:52,220
Oh, to be a highwayman on a night like this.

886
01:08:52,325 --> 01:08:54,555
Listen. Somebody's running.

887
01:08:54,627 --> 01:08:57,357
Horses? If it's a horse, it's learned how to shout.

888
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:00,695
What's she saying? We'll know in a minute. She's coming this way.

889
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:05,567
Sam Marlow! It's Wiggy. Old Wiggy.

890
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:11,733
Mr. Marlow! Mr. Marlow!

891
01:09:11,844 --> 01:09:15,405
Wiggy, what on earth do you want? L... He... You... Wants...

892
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:17,676
Catch your breath. He's a millionaire.

893
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,878
Who? He wants to buy your pictures, Mr. Marlow.

894
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,183
Which pictures? All of'em and more besides.

895
01:09:23,256 --> 01:09:25,520
He says you're a genius.

896
01:09:25,591 --> 01:09:28,856
He's right, but it's hard to believe he wants to buy all my pictures.

897
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:31,521
I'd be too curious to refuse at least to talk to him.

898
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:34,088
Don't turn down a good chance.

899
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:36,600
All right, I'll talk to him.

900
01:09:38,471 --> 01:09:41,372
We're digging sassafras root. Sassafras tea's mighty good for you.

901
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:44,672
Mr. Wiggs always swore it cured his arthritis just before he died.

902
01:09:44,777 --> 01:09:46,677
How much does the millionaire want to pay?

903
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:51,682
I asked seven dollars for that one looks like a lot of blobs of color in a thunderstorm.

904
01:09:51,717 --> 01:09:53,844
And? Said he couldn't think of it. Said they were priceless.

905
01:09:53,919 --> 01:09:57,047
Sounds like something I painted in kindergarten.

906
01:09:57,123 --> 01:09:59,921
I'll have you know that picture's symbolic of the beginning of the world.

907
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:03,587
That's where I first heard of the world, at kindergarten.

908
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,328
Yes, and my friend here, art critic for the Modern Museum...

909
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:11,598
Don't think I'm rude, but it doesn't matter to me what an art critic says.

910
01:10:11,704 --> 01:10:15,140
Is that so? I know my paintings are good.

911
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:18,643
He doesn't want them; you do. So all that matters is what you think.

912
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:22,909
I think they are works of genius, and I want to buy them all.

913
01:10:24,517 --> 01:10:26,917
Too bad. Why?

914
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:30,648
Just decided I can't sell them. Besides, you couldn't afford them.

915
01:10:30,723 --> 01:10:32,714
Oh.

916
01:10:32,825 --> 01:10:35,726
Uh... Money.

917
01:10:35,828 --> 01:10:39,764
Sammy. Don't be a fool. Make him pay through the nose.

918
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:42,824
Go ahead, Mr. Marlow. Be reasonable.

919
01:10:42,935 --> 01:10:44,994
Be unreasonable, if you want.

920
01:10:45,071 --> 01:10:47,039
What do you say?

921
01:10:50,276 --> 01:10:52,767
It's your genius. It's up to you.

922
01:10:56,649 --> 01:10:59,948
All right then. What do you like most in the whole world?

923
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:05,351
I don't know. Strawberries, I guess.

924
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:08,360
Strawberries. Write that down.

925
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:12,160
Two boxes of fresh strawberries, first of each month, in and out of season...

926
01:11:12,264 --> 01:11:14,164
from now on.

927
01:11:14,266 --> 01:11:16,666
Well, it's simple. What else?

928
01:11:16,702 --> 01:11:18,863
What would Arnie like?

929
01:11:20,206 --> 01:11:22,174
A chemical set.

930
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:25,700
What kind? Whatever smells the worst.

931
01:11:25,778 --> 01:11:28,212
Got that? Right.

932
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,874
One smelly chemical set.

933
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:33,042
Wiggy. Wiggy, what would you like?

934
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,849
Cash register. Chromium plated. One that rings a bell.

935
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:38,389
Got room for one? I'll find room.

936
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:41,221
Cash register. Chromium plated. One that rings a bell?

937
01:11:41,293 --> 01:11:43,227
Check.

938
01:11:43,295 --> 01:11:46,287
Miss Gravely, a beauty parlor, fully equipped?

939
01:11:46,332 --> 01:11:48,562
What for?

940
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:53,333
A hope chest... filled with the things I should have put in it and didn't.

941
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:57,069
A hope chest, full of hope.

942
01:11:57,143 --> 01:11:59,475
Captain?

943
01:11:59,545 --> 01:12:02,776
A good shotgun, plenty of ammunition,

944
01:12:02,848 --> 01:12:08,150
some corduroy britches, a plain shirt and a hunting cap, a brown one.

945
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:11,719
Davy Crockett... the works.

946
01:12:11,824 --> 01:12:15,419
Well, that's it, I guess. The paintings are yours.

947
01:12:15,528 --> 01:12:17,428
Yes, but what about you?

948
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:20,055
Yes, Sam, you've gotta ask for something.

949
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:22,066
Well, let's see.

950
01:12:25,438 --> 01:12:28,271
That's it.

951
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,968
- What's it? - Pardon me.

952
01:12:35,948 --> 01:12:37,848
What do you think?

953
01:12:40,553 --> 01:12:43,613
Yes, I think that can be easily arranged.

954
01:12:46,559 --> 01:12:48,686
Well. That's it, then.

955
01:12:48,761 --> 01:12:51,753
I'll come back in the morning for all these paintings.

956
01:12:51,797 --> 01:12:54,766
Mr. Marlow, this has been a night...

957
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,030
that I shall remember the rest of my life.

958
01:12:57,102 --> 01:13:00,196
Come back again. Have some more paintings for you next month.

959
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:03,366
And you'll have a steady customer in me,

960
01:13:03,476 --> 01:13:06,036
even if you raise your prices.

961
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:08,170
Well, good night, everyone.

962
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,180
Good night. Good night.

963
01:13:10,282 --> 01:13:12,307
All right, young man.

964
01:13:17,223 --> 01:13:19,555
Congratulations, Sammy. Good boy.

965
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:23,356
Did I do the right thing? You did just the right thing, Sam.

966
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:26,694
Good.

967
01:13:26,799 --> 01:13:29,290
Because it's important to me that you think so.

968
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:31,301
Why?

969
01:13:31,403 --> 01:13:33,803
Because I love you. I want to marry you.

970
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:37,999
Oh!

971
01:13:41,714 --> 01:13:44,410
You want to marry me? Um-hmm. Why not?

972
01:13:46,852 --> 01:13:49,821
Because... Because I just got my freedom today.

973
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:52,390
Easy come, easy go.

974
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:55,325
Besides, if you married me, you'd keep your freedom.

975
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:00,155
You must be practically unique, then.

976
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:04,362
I respect freedom. More than that, I love freedom.

977
01:14:04,436 --> 01:14:07,530
We might be the only free married couple in the world.

978
01:14:11,377 --> 01:14:13,845
This is very sudden, Sam.

979
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,848
You'll have to give me a little time to think about it.

980
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:24,855
Only fair. I'll give you until we get back to your house.

981
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:34,824
- What's goin' on here this time of night? - The most wonderful thing.

982
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,494
Mr. Marlow sold all his paintings to a millionaire.

983
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:40,061
Got more'n I ever figured he'd get. Money?

984
01:14:40,172 --> 01:14:43,630
Well, not exactly money.

985
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:46,610
I always knew they weren't worth the space.

986
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:50,012
I found these on a tramp hangin' 'round here.

987
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:53,415
Said he found 'em. On a... dead man.

988
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,415
Took me to where he said he found him, and...

989
01:14:58,724 --> 01:15:00,692
I didn't see any body.

990
01:15:03,796 --> 01:15:06,856
Montpelier 2000.

991
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:09,696
That's the state police number. Uh-huh.

992
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:12,828
I think, uh, we'd better get going.

993
01:15:12,905 --> 01:15:15,430
Thank you, Mr. Marlow, for the cash register.

994
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:17,441
It was a pleasure. Good night.

995
01:15:17,509 --> 01:15:19,670
Good night. Good night. Good night.

996
01:15:19,745 --> 01:15:21,713
Good night.

997
01:15:21,747 --> 01:15:23,715
Good night. Good night, Captain.

998
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:30,113
This is Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs.

999
01:15:30,222 --> 01:15:32,122
Yeah, I'll wait.

1000
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:52,135
Ma?

1001
01:15:52,244 --> 01:15:56,078
- Yes? - This picture here on the floor.

1002
01:15:56,148 --> 01:16:00,175
It's a new one. He did it today, but it isn't for sale.

1003
01:16:00,252 --> 01:16:03,346
Why not? You'll have to ask him that.

1004
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:07,050
He left it on his way over to Jennifer Rogers' house.

1005
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:10,060
Guess he didn't have time to take it home.

1006
01:16:12,164 --> 01:16:14,598
You suddenly got interested in art?

1007
01:16:15,768 --> 01:16:18,532
No.

1008
01:16:18,604 --> 01:16:21,869
It's just that it matches the description of...

1009
01:16:21,974 --> 01:16:24,670
Oh, hello, Sergeant.

1010
01:16:24,777 --> 01:16:26,677
Calvin Wiggs.

1011
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:29,407
Got something that might interest you a little.

1012
01:16:29,481 --> 01:16:33,577
It seems I picked up this tramp with a pair of stolen shoes...

1013
01:16:33,686 --> 01:16:36,120
and a wild story about a corpse.

1014
01:16:56,842 --> 01:16:59,936
What do you think? Him walking in with Harry Worp's shoes...

1015
01:17:00,012 --> 01:17:03,140
in his hand and then that phone call to the police.

1016
01:17:03,215 --> 01:17:05,706
Don't know. I may be wrong,

1017
01:17:05,818 --> 01:17:07,843
but I don't think he's tied us into it yet.

1018
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,218
Oh, the way he looked at me.

1019
01:17:10,322 --> 01:17:12,756
If he'd known anything, he'd have kept us there.

1020
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:17,387
But modern police methods are all psychological now, Sammy. Psychological.

1021
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:22,264
They just wear you down and wear you down until...

1022
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:25,326
you're almost grateful to get into that gas chamber.

1023
01:17:26,872 --> 01:17:31,741
The police'll probably tell him, if the shoes fit, to keep them.

1024
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:34,371
Oh, well.

1025
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:47,621
I've decided, Sam. Decided what?

1026
01:17:47,693 --> 01:17:49,661
I will marry you,

1027
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:52,163
if you haven't forgotten about asking me.

1028
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:57,396
I'm... I'm very fond of you and,

1029
01:17:57,469 --> 01:17:59,869
I think you'd make a good father for Arnie...

1030
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:05,976
and for some other reasons best left unsaid.

1031
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:09,247
Marriage is the comfortable way to spend the winter,

1032
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:13,307
but right now we should be working on some good story to satisfy the state police...

1033
01:18:13,385 --> 01:18:16,320
if they should turn up.

1034
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:20,484
Would you believe it? I'd almost forgotten that proposal.

1035
01:18:20,592 --> 01:18:24,119
I have witnesses, Sam. Oh, I remember now.

1036
01:18:24,196 --> 01:18:28,155
All right, you've got yourself a husband.

1037
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:30,428
I think I'll kiss you now to prove it.

1038
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:42,044
Lightly, Sam. I have a very short fuse.

1039
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:54,083
What a pretty sight.

1040
01:19:01,066 --> 01:19:04,866
Sam, what did you ask the millionaire for?

1041
01:19:11,777 --> 01:19:13,745
That's very practical.

1042
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:20,482
Congratulations, my dear.

1043
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:23,988
You're a lucky man, Sammy. I think you'll both be very happy.

1044
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:25,990
Thank you. If I grumbled too much...

1045
01:19:26,058 --> 01:19:29,721
at my share of the work in burying Harry, I'm sorry.

1046
01:19:29,795 --> 01:19:31,922
I can see now it was well worth it.

1047
01:19:31,997 --> 01:19:35,797
And if I can do anything else... Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1048
01:19:39,504 --> 01:19:43,964
- What's wrong, Sam? - Harry. We're not quite finished with him yet.

1049
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:47,807
Sam, if anybody's through, it's Harry. He's been buried three times.

1050
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,280
Before we can get married, you're gonna have to prove that you're free.

1051
01:19:50,382 --> 01:19:54,341
To prove you're free, you'll have to prove that Harry... Is dead.

1052
01:19:55,787 --> 01:20:00,815
- What a horrible complication. - Oh!

1053
01:20:00,893 --> 01:20:04,158
I don't know that it is.

1054
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:06,493
What are you looking at me for?

1055
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:12,263
Sammy, I'll do anything to help you, but please,

1056
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:15,101
please don't ask me to dig up Harry again!

1057
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:18,506
- Oh, come, come now, Captain. - No, we can't.

1058
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,511
If you're thinking of the bad publicity... NO, I'm nOt.

1059
01:20:22,915 --> 01:20:26,749
I think Sam would be worth just about anything.

1060
01:20:26,818 --> 01:20:29,218
I'm thinking of you, Miss Gravely.

1061
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:34,349
Murder is murder, no matter how exonerating the circumstances and...

1062
01:20:34,426 --> 01:20:36,724
It just wouldn't look nice at all for you.

1063
01:20:36,828 --> 01:20:39,729
That's right! Better let him stay where he is.

1064
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:43,633
You won't have to wait seven years to presume death, anyway.

1065
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:45,637
Seven years! I'll be an old man.

1066
01:20:45,671 --> 01:20:48,731
Don't be silly. You waited far longer than seven years already.

1067
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,139
Yes, but now I know what I'm waiting for.

1068
01:20:52,244 --> 01:20:54,371
I insist that you dig the wretched man up.

1069
01:20:54,446 --> 01:20:57,074
I don't care a hoot what they say.

1070
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:00,312
They'd only have to know me to realize the man must have been mad.

1071
01:21:00,385 --> 01:21:04,788
I disagree! Huh! Really, Capt. Wiles.

1072
01:21:06,558 --> 01:21:08,651
Well...

1073
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,921
I'll dig him up.

1074
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:13,396
But we'd better get it done before Calvin Wiggs...

1075
01:21:13,465 --> 01:21:16,127
gets the state police snooping around here.

1076
01:21:22,975 --> 01:21:25,705
I've been thinking.

1077
01:21:25,777 --> 01:21:29,941
I've been thinking maybe we could forget the way it really happened.

1078
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,984
I could tell how Harry visited me and went off in such a rage today,

1079
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:36,579
and that's all we'd need to know about his being there.

1080
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:38,713
No, somebody else might get the blame.

1081
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:42,851
And somebody else might not have such a good reason as I did.

1082
01:21:42,928 --> 01:21:46,295
What do you mean "somebody else"?

1083
01:21:46,398 --> 01:21:50,334
I can think of at least two people with a good reason for having killed Harry.

1084
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:54,566
First you, because you married him. And now Sam.

1085
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,006
Me? Why would I want to kill him? I never met him before.

1086
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,578
You could still have a reason for killing him.

1087
01:22:00,645 --> 01:22:02,772
She means me. Yes.

1088
01:22:02,848 --> 01:22:06,340
I didn't fall in love with Jennifer until after Harry was dead.

1089
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:08,477
Try telling that to the police.

1090
01:22:08,553 --> 01:22:11,818
She's right, Sammy boy.

1091
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:16,451
Well, on second thought, we'd better stick to the truth, what there is of it.

1092
01:22:22,768 --> 01:22:26,898
We'll have to think up a reason why the police weren't informed before now.

1093
01:22:26,972 --> 01:22:30,430
Yes, then there's the condition he's in. That'll take some explaining.

1094
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:33,136
We'll just clean him up a bit.

1095
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:36,043
It's horrible, but there's nothing else we can do.

1096
01:22:36,148 --> 01:22:38,708
We can't risk complicating Miss Gravely's confession.

1097
01:22:38,784 --> 01:22:41,617
And as for the delay, I can explain that I was so upset...

1098
01:22:41,686 --> 01:22:45,281
by the occurrence that... I went straight home and rested.

1099
01:22:45,357 --> 01:22:49,020
Only natural. They'll think you rested rather a long time.

1100
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:52,188
Sam, I'd rather not spend the whole night debating.

1101
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:54,596
Let's get Harry someplace and clean him up.

1102
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:59,069
Let's get out of here.

1103
01:23:09,915 --> 01:23:13,476
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks.

1104
01:23:13,585 --> 01:23:16,418
Bears it out even to the edge of doom.

1105
01:23:16,488 --> 01:23:20,390
If this be error and upon me proved,

1106
01:23:20,492 --> 01:23:24,588
I never writ, nor man ever loved.

1107
01:23:34,306 --> 01:23:38,606
I, uh, I think he met with a bit of an accident, Dr. Greenbow.

1108
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:40,611
He certainly did.

1109
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:44,248
Which of you found him?

1110
01:23:44,316 --> 01:23:47,308
Well... He was my husband, Doctor.

1111
01:23:47,352 --> 01:23:51,015
Oh, Mrs. Rogers. I didn't know you had a husband.

1112
01:23:51,123 --> 01:23:53,387
I'm awfully sorry.

1113
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:56,621
It's all right, Doctor. It's just life, I guess.

1114
01:23:56,728 --> 01:23:59,288
What happened to him? Well, he...

1115
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:04,233
That's what we'd like to know. Could you tell us what caused his death? It was so sudden.

1116
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:06,827
In this light, my opinion would be little more than a guess.

1117
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:09,771
In that case, we could take him someplace where you could see better.

1118
01:24:09,841 --> 01:24:13,436
All right, but I need my bag. Where shall we meet?

1119
01:24:13,545 --> 01:24:15,945
I'll take Harry home to my house.

1120
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:22,809
Going home for the last time.

1121
01:24:27,492 --> 01:24:29,722
Better be the last time.

1122
01:24:29,794 --> 01:24:33,252
Come on, Sam. I've got about one more trip left in me.

1123
01:24:33,298 --> 01:24:35,493
I'll get your coats.

1124
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:32,223
I'll get the suspenders on.

1125
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:42,632
I can't wait for this to be ready. I'll have to iron it dry.

1126
01:25:44,469 --> 01:25:46,437
Isn't it odd?

1127
01:25:46,471 --> 01:25:51,204
After refusing for so long, here I am finally doing Harry's laundry.

1128
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:12,191
Ah!

1129
01:26:12,264 --> 01:26:14,323
Look.

1130
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:16,993
It's nothing to get excited about, Captain.

1131
01:26:17,068 --> 01:26:20,060
It's only a closet door.

1132
01:26:20,105 --> 01:26:22,801
Oh. I thought it was Harry.

1133
01:26:22,874 --> 01:26:25,604
Relax, Captain. Nothing to worry about.

1134
01:26:31,383 --> 01:26:34,648
What about the cut I made on his head with my hiking shoe?

1135
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:37,813
Hmm. I'll put some adhesive tape on it.

1136
01:26:37,889 --> 01:26:39,880
They'll think it was done before he died.

1137
01:26:39,991 --> 01:26:42,892
After the shirt's finished, it should be just about everything.

1138
01:26:44,996 --> 01:26:47,760
If that who I think it is... Calvin Wiggs' car.

1139
01:27:11,256 --> 01:27:13,417
Just one second.

1140
01:27:23,134 --> 01:27:25,864
Well, Calvin Wiggs. What a surprise.

1141
01:27:25,937 --> 01:27:28,838
Sam here? Yes, yes, yes, he's here.

1142
01:27:28,873 --> 01:27:31,865
Can I see him a minute?

1143
01:27:31,943 --> 01:27:33,877
Sam! Yeah?

1144
01:27:33,945 --> 01:27:36,277
Calvin Wiggs is here to see you.

1145
01:27:36,348 --> 01:27:38,282
Tell him I'll be right out.

1146
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:41,842
He says he'll be right out. Why don't I just go on in?

1147
01:27:47,492 --> 01:27:49,460
Evening, Calvin.

1148
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:52,962
Evening, Capt. Wiles. Miss Gravely.

1149
01:27:52,997 --> 01:27:55,124
We've got 'em on the run in four spades.

1150
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,363
They should have been in diamonds.

1151
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:01,303
Play much bridge? Never play it.

1152
01:28:01,373 --> 01:28:05,275
- That's what I thought. - Something you wanted, Calvin?

1153
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:08,710
- Where were you today, Sam? - Working, as usual.

1154
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:12,944
Somewheres down by Mansfield Meadows?

1155
01:28:13,017 --> 01:28:15,349
Possibly. I do quite a bit of sketching around. Why?

1156
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:21,290
Is that where, uh...

1157
01:28:23,228 --> 01:28:25,696
Where you painted this?

1158
01:28:28,032 --> 01:28:30,398
I left that portrait with your mother.

1159
01:28:30,502 --> 01:28:32,902
What right do you have to carry it around with you? It might be damaged.

1160
01:28:33,004 --> 01:28:36,997
Huh. It could be priceless, and Sam would lose a sale.

1161
01:28:37,108 --> 01:28:40,737
Oh, I'll send him a box of blueberries the first of every month.

1162
01:28:40,812 --> 01:28:43,838
Sam, what I wanna know is where'd you paint it and who is it?

1163
01:28:43,915 --> 01:28:47,316
First of all, it's not a painting. It's a drawing.

1164
01:28:47,352 --> 01:28:49,650
Matter of fact, it's a pastel and...

1165
01:28:49,721 --> 01:28:53,623
as for the model, just came to me out of the blue.

1166
01:28:53,725 --> 01:28:57,752
- You don't say. - Why are you acting like a deputy sheriff?

1167
01:28:57,829 --> 01:29:00,593
That tramp I picked up, the one with the stolen shoes?

1168
01:29:00,665 --> 01:29:03,395
Said he got 'em off a dead man?

1169
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:07,461
He described him very carefully. The description fits this picture to a "T. ''

1170
01:29:07,539 --> 01:29:11,475
A tramp who probably can't keep his job and drinks too much...

1171
01:29:11,543 --> 01:29:14,034
I wouldn't think his word was very reliable.

1172
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:17,444
Got him locked up in the schoolhouse.

1173
01:29:17,549 --> 01:29:20,017
I took this painting down to show him... Drawing, if you don't mind.

1174
01:29:20,084 --> 01:29:23,053
I took the drawing down to show him. He almost fainted.

1175
01:29:23,087 --> 01:29:26,215
Said it was the same face. Where'd you paint it, Sam?

1176
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:31,257
From my vast subconscious.

1177
01:29:31,362 --> 01:29:35,264
Sam, I hate to say this, but I don't believe you.

1178
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,268
With all this talk, I've lost interest in the game.

1179
01:29:37,302 --> 01:29:39,862
If you'll forgive me, I'll just run along home.

1180
01:29:39,971 --> 01:29:43,202
I'll see you all tOmOrrOw.

1181
01:29:45,176 --> 01:29:47,576
What do you mean, you don't believe me?

1182
01:29:47,612 --> 01:29:52,777
What I mean, Sam... I ain't educated in fancy art,

1183
01:29:52,884 --> 01:29:56,684
but I do know the face of a dead man when I see one, and this is it.

1184
01:29:56,721 --> 01:30:00,589
Calvin Perhaps I can teach you Abstract art

1185
01:30:01,726 --> 01:30:05,355
See this? Portrait of a sleeping face.

1186
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:10,299
A man, relaxed, far removed from earthly cares.

1187
01:30:10,335 --> 01:30:14,499
It was conceived out of memory and half-forgotten impulse,

1188
01:30:14,606 --> 01:30:17,074
and it emerged from the shadows of abstract emotions,

1189
01:30:17,141 --> 01:30:22,306
until it was born full-grown from the mechanical reality of my fingertips.

1190
01:30:22,413 --> 01:30:25,109
Oh, now Sam, don't... I don't have to have a model to draw from.

1191
01:30:25,216 --> 01:30:27,878
Instead of creating a sleeping face, I could have, um,

1192
01:30:27,952 --> 01:30:31,285
chosen an entirely different set of artistic stimuli.

1193
01:30:31,356 --> 01:30:35,588
My subconscious is peopled with enough faces to cover the earth.

1194
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:40,120
And the construction of the human anatomy alone is so infinitely variable...

1195
01:30:40,164 --> 01:30:43,133
as to lie beyond the wildest powers of calculation.

1196
01:30:43,234 --> 01:30:47,330
Now, a raised eyelid, perhaps.

1197
01:30:50,441 --> 01:30:53,899
A line of fullness to the cheek.

1198
01:30:53,978 --> 01:30:56,674
Lip that bends with expression.

1199
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:00,484
There.

1200
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:04,916
Sam, do you... Do you know what you just did?

1201
01:31:04,989 --> 01:31:09,187
Certainly. Just showed you how clearly you misinterpreted my art.

1202
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,457
You just destroyed legal evidence.

1203
01:31:13,765 --> 01:31:17,599
Calvin, it appears to me you still don't understand.

1204
01:31:17,669 --> 01:31:20,661
I understand you made kind of a fool out of me.

1205
01:31:20,705 --> 01:31:24,038
But I still got enough evidence to know something funny's goin' on around here.

1206
01:31:24,108 --> 01:31:27,009
I ain't goin' to sleep till I find out what it is.

1207
01:31:29,881 --> 01:31:32,475
Good night, Calvin.

1208
01:31:36,321 --> 01:31:38,983
Hey! What's he doin' in our bathtub?

1209
01:31:42,026 --> 01:31:45,120
- That's where frogs belong. - Oh.

1210
01:31:45,196 --> 01:31:48,962
- Back to bed, Arnie - State troopers'll be up in the mornin'.

1211
01:31:49,033 --> 01:31:52,298
I'm gonna want 'em to have a talk with you, so be around.

1212
01:31:52,403 --> 01:31:55,395
- I said back to bed. - You can find me at my studio.

1213
01:31:55,506 --> 01:31:59,567
Just make sure...

1214
01:32:02,747 --> 01:32:04,715
Where is he?

1215
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:08,912
He-He's in the bathroom playing with his frog.

1216
01:32:11,556 --> 01:32:15,515
- Oh? - I'm... This way, please, Doctor.

1217
01:32:17,328 --> 01:32:19,489
It's Arnie. He's not very well.

1218
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:25,226
Someone must be foolin' around with my car.

1219
01:32:36,481 --> 01:32:40,042
What are you playin' with the horn for? It ain't your car.

1220
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:42,949
Well, things are funny, you know?

1221
01:32:43,054 --> 01:32:46,353
Me and Miss Gravely might be in the car market. We're looking for a car.

1222
01:32:46,457 --> 01:32:49,620
Yes. Had a look at this one. It's a beauty.

1223
01:32:49,694 --> 01:32:51,685
I want to keep it that way.

1224
01:32:51,763 --> 01:32:55,028
Now, now, that's not the way to talk to a prospective customer.

1225
01:32:55,099 --> 01:32:58,432
You're no prospective customer. You can't afford this car.

1226
01:33:10,982 --> 01:33:12,882
He's gone.

1227
01:33:12,984 --> 01:33:16,613
I put the little... I put Arnie back to bed.

1228
01:33:16,688 --> 01:33:19,589
What'd the doctor say? He said for me to get out.

1229
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:23,684
I didn't like the look in his eye, either. Something seems to be bothering him.

1230
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:29,961
Well, Captain. Did you get over being frightened?

1231
01:33:31,102 --> 01:33:33,627
Frightened?

1232
01:33:33,705 --> 01:33:36,367
Oh, no. That's not why I left.

1233
01:33:36,441 --> 01:33:39,968
No. I'm not easily frightened, you know. No.

1234
01:33:40,044 --> 01:33:44,003
Why, after all those years sailing the four corners of the globe,

1235
01:33:44,048 --> 01:33:47,540
strange ports, a lot of rough men and...

1236
01:33:50,254 --> 01:33:54,350
Miss Gravely, what would you say...

1237
01:33:54,425 --> 01:33:56,484
if I told you...

1238
01:33:56,561 --> 01:33:59,553
I was only the captain of a tugboat...

1239
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,564
on the East River...

1240
01:34:01,632 --> 01:34:05,193
and never got more than a mile or so off shore?

1241
01:34:11,843 --> 01:34:14,505
Well, I would say that,

1242
01:34:14,579 --> 01:34:17,343
that you were the handsomest tugboat captain...

1243
01:34:17,448 --> 01:34:19,643
that ever sailed up the East River.

1244
01:34:21,552 --> 01:34:24,146
Oh, maybe not. No.

1245
01:34:24,255 --> 01:34:27,383
You want to see something? Here.

1246
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:31,560
Captain. Where'd you get those?

1247
01:34:31,662 --> 01:34:34,893
Calvin Wiggs' car.

1248
01:34:34,966 --> 01:34:36,900
I figured you were handling half the evidence, Sammy,

1249
01:34:36,968 --> 01:34:39,163
so it was up to me to take care of the rest.

1250
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:42,364
You're the sweetest, old tugboat captain I ever kissed.

1251
01:34:42,707 --> 01:34:45,403
What's he doing in the bathtub?

1252
01:34:45,476 --> 01:34:48,274
Well, uh... What'd you find out, Doctor?

1253
01:34:48,379 --> 01:34:52,713
Oh, that. It was his heart. He had a seizure.

1254
01:34:52,784 --> 01:34:55,514
His heart? Yes, but...

1255
01:34:55,586 --> 01:34:58,680
A seizure! Well, I'll take a trip to the Philippines.

1256
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:01,759
Death from natural causes. Well, certainly.

1257
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:05,956
But will somebody tell me what he's doin' in the bathtub half undressed?

1258
01:35:07,899 --> 01:35:10,834
Frankly, we didn't want Calvin Wiggs to see him.

1259
01:35:12,937 --> 01:35:15,428
Besides, he was awful dirty after we dug him up.

1260
01:35:15,506 --> 01:35:17,906
"Dug him up"?

1261
01:35:18,009 --> 01:35:20,705
I'd better explain, Doctor. You see,

1262
01:35:20,812 --> 01:35:23,781
Harry's been buried and dug up on and off all day long.

1263
01:35:23,848 --> 01:35:25,816
What?

1264
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:28,114
Finally, he caused so many complications that...

1265
01:35:28,219 --> 01:35:31,518
we decided to clean him up and put him back where we found him.

1266
01:35:31,622 --> 01:35:34,113
I don't understand you. What complications?

1267
01:35:34,225 --> 01:35:36,750
Well, for example,

1268
01:35:36,828 --> 01:35:40,229
he upset Capt. Wiles because the captain thought he had shot him.

1269
01:35:40,331 --> 01:35:44,028
The hole in the head, you know. But as it turned out, it wasn't the captain.

1270
01:35:44,135 --> 01:35:47,332
It was the blow he got from the heel of Miss Gravely's shoe after he attacked her.

1271
01:35:47,438 --> 01:35:50,134
Capt. Wiles attacked Miss Gravely?

1272
01:35:50,241 --> 01:35:53,074
Oh, no, Doctor. Harry.

1273
01:35:53,144 --> 01:35:55,738
He dragged her into the bushes, thinking it was me.

1274
01:35:55,847 --> 01:36:00,045
He was dazed, I supposed, after I hit him on the head with a milk bottle.

1275
01:36:04,088 --> 01:36:06,921
The captain and Sam buried him first.

1276
01:36:06,991 --> 01:36:09,653
The captain was so scared.

1277
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,163
Then he accounted for all his bullets, so up Harry came.

1278
01:36:14,198 --> 01:36:16,758
Then Miss Gravely thought her shoe was responsible for it so...

1279
01:36:16,868 --> 01:36:21,032
- Shoe? - So the captain... rather gallantly, I thought...

1280
01:36:21,105 --> 01:36:23,073
pushed him back in again.

1281
01:36:23,107 --> 01:36:26,338
Then he was out and back... I can't remember why.

1282
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:29,470
But anyway, he's out again now because Sam and I wanna get married.

1283
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:32,674
Yeah. But why did you...

1284
01:36:32,783 --> 01:36:34,683
Hit him on the head?

1285
01:36:34,785 --> 01:36:38,084
That wouldn't interest you. It's purely personal and nonmedical.

1286
01:36:38,189 --> 01:36:41,750
Besides, it's awfully late, so if you'll just keep quiet about all this,

1287
01:36:41,826 --> 01:36:44,090
we'll put Harry back in the morning, nice and clean,

1288
01:36:44,195 --> 01:36:46,095
and no one will be any the wiser.

1289
01:36:46,197 --> 01:36:48,688
And then we'll be rid of all these sticky complications.

1290
01:36:48,799 --> 01:36:51,063
Put him back. Put him back, that's all. Just put him back.

1291
01:36:51,135 --> 01:36:54,434
This is the first nightmare I've had in 25 years.

1292
01:36:58,442 --> 01:37:00,307
He's kinda strange, isn't he?

1293
01:37:06,617 --> 01:37:10,713
Well, um, hadn't we better get Harry dressed?

1294
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:12,755
Yes, yes.

1295
01:37:19,363 --> 01:37:22,423
Wouldn't it be nice if Arnie found him all over again?

1296
01:37:22,533 --> 01:37:25,468
Then he'd run home and tell me, and then I'd phone Calvin Wiggs.

1297
01:37:25,536 --> 01:37:28,699
Yes! Arnie could explain quite clearly to Calvin...

1298
01:37:28,773 --> 01:37:32,675
That he found Harry tomorrow. You mean today.

1299
01:37:32,743 --> 01:37:35,143
But to Arnie, tomorrow is yesterday.

1300
01:37:37,048 --> 01:37:39,039
Let's go get Harry. Come on, Captain.

1301
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,564
Here he comes.

1302
01:38:15,219 --> 01:38:17,187
Go on, Arnie. Run home and tell me about it.

1303
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:19,189
Don't touch him.

1304
01:38:19,223 --> 01:38:21,714
Please, Arnie, run home and tell your mother.

1305
01:38:21,792 --> 01:38:23,885
Beat it, you little creep.

1306
01:38:23,995 --> 01:38:27,590
I mean, hurry home, son.

1307
01:38:36,741 --> 01:38:39,232
Captain, you never told me your first name.

1308
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:41,244
Albert. What's yours?

1309
01:38:41,312 --> 01:38:45,510
Ivy. Albert, let's go.

1310
01:38:45,616 --> 01:38:47,516
Just a minute, ma'am. I want to ask Sam something.

1311
01:38:47,618 --> 01:38:50,553
Sam, what did you ask the millionaire to bring you?

1312
01:38:59,063 --> 01:39:01,031
Albert, what was it?

1313
01:39:02,333 --> 01:39:04,824
A double bed.
