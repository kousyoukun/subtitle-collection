3
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:52,941


4
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,650
{\fs17}[Man ] Okay! I know how to handle your type!

5
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:57,033
{\fs17}Well, old faithful, that's your shooting for the day.

6
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,936
{\fs17}If we haven't rung up at least two rabbits,

7
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,529
{\fs17}we deserve to go home empty-handed.

8
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:07,237
{\fs17}Yeah. Still, blessed are they who expect nothing...

9
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,541
{\fs17}for they shall not be disappointed.

10
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:15,348
{\fs17}Mmm. Fewer things in life give a man more pleasure than hunting.

11
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:18,116
{\fs17}It satisfies his primitive nature...

12
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,523
{\fs17}striding through the woods, picking up his kill.

13
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:24,562
{\fs17}Well, come on, old faithful.

14
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:28,463
{\fs17}There's plump rabbits waiting for the frying pan.

15
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,920
{\fs17}If this can had four legs and a tail, we'd be eating it tonight.

16
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,989
{\fs17}Clean through the heart.

17
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,967
{\fs17}For rice cake, I've done him in.

18
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:40,630
{\fs17}Cor.

19
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:45,199
{\fs17}A harmless potshot at a rabbit and I'm a murderer... a killer.

20
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:48,246
{\fs17}Mother always said I'd come to a bad end.

21
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,840
{\fs17}What in Hades were you doing here anyway?

22
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:56,211
{\fs17}I can't say that I've seen you around here before.

23
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:00,247
{\fs17}No. If you're going to get yourself shot, do it where you're known.

24
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,895
{\fs17}"Mr. Harry Worp,

25
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,202
{\fs17}8 7 Maple Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts."

26
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,938
{\fs17}Well, Worp, you're a long way from home.

27
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,981
{\fs17}With the looks of it, you won't get back for Christmas. No.

28
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:28,447
{\fs17}We're going to have a cold, hard winter.

29
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,183
{\fs17}Mmm. You might keep here a long time... an awful long time.

30
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,418
{\fs17}Too long for me, Harry.

31
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,427
{\fs17}Yes.

32
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,339
{\fs17}Captain Wiles?

33
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,477
{\fs17}Yes, ma'am?

34
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,514
{\fs17}What seems to be the trouble, Captain?

35
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,283
{\fs17}Well, it's what you might call an unavoidable accident.

36
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,586
{\fs17}He's dead. Yes.

37
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:13,492
{\fs17}I would say that he was. Of course, that's an unprofessional opinion.

38
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:16,898
{\fs17}Yeah. Did you, uh... Did you know him, Miss Gravely?

39
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:20,335
{\fs17}No. Doesn't live around here?

40
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,398
{\fs17}Well, he died around here. That's what counts now. Embarrassing.

41
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:28,242
{\fs17}What do you plan to do with him, Captain?

42
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:33,649
{\fs17}Miss Gravely, without cutting the hem off truth garment,

43
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,778
{\fs17}I'm gonna hide him, cover him up,

44
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:39,949
{\fs17}forget him.

45
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,988
{\fs17}Are you never going to inform the police, Captain?

46
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:48,226
{\fs17}No. Forget you saw me, Miss Gravely.

47
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,268
{\fs17}Chase it out of your mind, for heaven's sake.

48
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,964
{\fs17}It was an accident. He was poking around the clearing...

49
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,097
{\fs17}and I thought he was a rabbit or something.

50
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:59,871
{\fs17}It was a human error. Ah, now, please, don't...

51
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:03,243
{\fs17}Don't say anything to anybody, Miss Gravely.

52
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,578
{\fs17}Do as you think best, Captain.

53
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,678
{\fs17}I'm sure you must have met many similar situations...

54
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,019
{\fs17}in your travels in foreign lands.

55
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,355
{\fs17}Yeah. I've seen much worse things.

56
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,395
{\fs17}I certainly won't say anything. Much worse things.

57
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,556
{\fs17}I remember when I was on the Orinoco.

58
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,599
{\fs17}We had a Turk, a great, big Turk there...

59
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,601
{\fs17}running amuck with a machete.

60
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:26,331
{\fs17}Captain, if I were going to hide an accident, I shouldn't delay.

61
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:31,206
{\fs17}Oh. Oh. You're right as rain, Miss Gravely.

62
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:35,006
{\fs17}Yes. You know something? I'm glad I met you today.

63
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:38,014
{\fs17}I feel better for telling somebody as warm,

64
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:42,519
{\fs17}tender, understanding as yourself.

65
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,751
{\fs17}Well, on the contrary, Captain. It...

66
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:52,161
{\fs17}It... I'm certainly glad if I helped you, Captain.

67
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,358
{\fs17}Perhaps you would care to come over for some blueberry muffins...

68
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,835
{\fs17}and coffee later on... high-bush blueberries?

69
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,430
{\fs17}Ah, well. This is certainly something of an interesting surprise.

70
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,202
{\fs17}And perhaps a touch of elderberry wine. Oh.

71
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:08,440
{\fs17}After all, we've been neighbors for nearly three years now...

72
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,515
{\fs17}and we've never exchanged social calls.

73
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:13,608
{\fs17}You're right. It's high time I paid a call.

74
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:17,553
{\fs17}What time? Oh, say, early this afternoon?

75
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:21,319
{\fs17}I'll be there with a clean shirt and a hungry face.

76
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:25,659
{\fs17}Do that. You better be going along now.

77
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,664
{\fs17}Don't want to be an accessory after the fact.

78
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:32,730
{\fs17}You are a considerate man, Capt. Wiles.

79
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,638
{\fs17}Good-bye. Good-bye.

80
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,788
{\fs17}[Boy ] Almost there, Mommy!

81
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,035
{\fs17}Here he is, Mommy. Here he is.

82
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,208
{\fs17}What did I tell ya, Mommy? Don't touch it, Arnie.

83
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,838
{\fs17}There he is. No. It can't be! Harry!

84
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:19,613
{\fs17}Harry. Thank Providence, the last of Harry.

85
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:23,313
{\fs17}- Who's Providence, Mommy? - A very good friend.

86
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,946
{\fs17}Don't you know who it is? You said Harry.

87
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:29,755
{\fs17}Can't you remember, Arnie? Why don't he get up and do something?

88
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:33,594
{\fs17}He's asleep. He's in a deep sleep...

89
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:37,533
{\fs17}A deep wonderful sleep...How did he heat his head?

90
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,934
{\fs17}Putting it where it wasn't wanted would be my guess.

91
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:42,939
{\fs17}- Will it get better? - Not if we're lucky.

92
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:47,236
{\fs17}Let's run home and I'll make you some lemonade.

93
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:50,837
{\fs17}Will lemonade put me in a wonderful, deep, deep sleep, Mommy?

94
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,680
{\fs17}- No, Arnie, but it's better than no lemonade. - I don't understand that.

95
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,846
{\fs17}Never mind. Now, you just forget you ever saw this man.

96
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,855
{\fs17}Is there a special way to forget?

97
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:02,358
{\fs17}Just think of something else. I think I'll try not to see him tomorrow, Mommy.

98
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:06,160
{\fs17}That's a good boy, Arnie. Now, let's run home and get that lemonade.

99
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,267
{\fs17}She won't care what I do with him.

100
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:29,787
{\fs17}Couldn't have had more people here if I'd sold tickets.

101
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:32,914
{\fs17}What's the big attraction, I wonder?

102
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,819
{\fs17}This could turn out to be the luckiest day of my life.

103
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:18,364
{\fs17}Might as well sit here till the rest of the world comes by to pay their last respects.

{\fs17}Wiggy. Wiggy. You haven't sold a painting.

130
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,834
{\fs17}All my pictures in the same place.

131
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,641
{\fs17}So few cars. They don't seem to...

132
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:18,045
{\fs17}I guess the cider takes their attention. Cider?

133
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:20,050
{\fs17}Cider, indeed. Throw it away! Drink it!

{\fs17}No, I hate cider. Not a picture sold.

{\fs17}Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Marlow. Let's get a look at your new one.

136
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:29,724
{\fs17}- Hold it up. - What good would it do to show it to you?

{\fs17}You don't deserve to see it. How am I going to eat?

{\fs17}You think we'd do any better on Fifth Avenue?

141
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:47,005
{\fs17}If there's more people there. Oh, lots of people.

142
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,137
{\fs17}Hundreds and thousands and billions of people.

143
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,239
{\fs17}Well, it might be better then. But what sort of people, Wiggy?

144
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,047
{\fs17}What breed? I'll tell you. They're little people...

145
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:59,282
{\fs17}little people with hats on.

146
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,258
{\fs17}How are your cigarettes?

147
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,236
{\fs17}Now I'll buy the other half tomorrow. [Car Hood Closing ]

{\fs17}What does your son do with all those old cars he always works on?

149
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:29,378
{\fs17}He sells 'em. Mechanical antiques. Doesn't make much, but he needs the money.

150
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,892
{\fs17}Hmm. Doesn't he get paid for being deputy sheriff?

151
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,895
{\fs17}Piecework. Gets paid by the arrest, I think.

152
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,558
{\fs17}Ah, Mr. Marlow. It's wonderful.

153
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:52,809
{\fs17}I've been in a tortured mood lately. What is it?

154
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,471
{\fs17}Good old Wiggy, my sternest critic.

155
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:58,014
{\fs17}Even if I don't understand your work, I think it's beautiful.

156
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:00,016
{\fs17}So does Mrs. Rogers.

157
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:02,518
{\fs17}Oh? You talk about me? Well, l...

158
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,679
{\fs17}She's the pretty woman with the little boy, isn't she?

159
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,747
{\fs17}Mm-hmm. I only brought up your name once...

160
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:09,349
{\fs17}when we were talking about strange people.

161
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,918
{\fs17}Huh? That is, strangers...

162
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,521
{\fs17}Oh. People she hadn't met yet.

163
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,157
{\fs17}And, uh, what does the pretty, little thing say about me?

164
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:21,467
{\fs17}Nothin'. I think we better discuss business.

165
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,939
{\fs17}Here... my shopping list.

166
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,237
{\fs17}I'll go in and start puttin' it up.

167
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,955
{\fs17}Say, Wiggy. How do you spell Tuscaloosa?

168
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:42,686
{\fs17}Sam?

169
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,853
{\fs17}Hi, Calvin. You hear any shootin' a while back?

170
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,693
{\fs17}- Nope. - Well, I did.

171
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,892
{\fs17}And there shouldn't be any shootin' around here. Why?

172
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,902
{\fs17}It's posted land, that's why.

173
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,906
{\fs17}Why's that? 'Cause I posted it.

174
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,171
{\fs17}What you got against people doing a little shooting now and then... let off a little steam?

175
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:01,871
{\fs17}Bullets and guns are dangerous they injuriously

176
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,143
{\fs17}No one around here could hit a freight car with a cannon.

177
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,916
{\fs17}I guess you're right, Sam. All the same, the law's the law.

178
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,151
{\fs17}And I got a good mind to scout around and find out who's doin' the shootin'...

179
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,419
{\fs17}and level a little fine.

180
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,427
{\fs17}And pick up a little piecework?

181
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:21,989
{\fs17}Well, if I can do anything to make it any harder for you, you let me know.

182
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,543
{\fs17}How'd you want your bacon, Mr. Marlow?

183
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:11,036
{\fs17}What were you saying? I asked how you want your bacon.

184

{\fs17}[Breathing Deeply] What a wonderful day.

187
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,396
{\fs17}So was yesterday, but you didn't say anything to me about it.

188
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:31,196
{\fs17}What you want Calvin for?

189
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:34,170
{\fs17}These marvelous pictures.

190
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:36,799
{\fs17}Someone told me they were yours.

191
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:39,968
{\fs17}Why don't you sell them, make a lot of money? Never thought of that.

192
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,978
{\fs17}I guess I'll just have to think about it. And that song...

193
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,607
{\fs17}You sing it so beautifully. You wrote it yourself, of course.

{\fs17}What do you want to borrow? Oh, dear.

196

{\fs17}How'd you know my name? Well, it's on the pictures, isn't it?

197
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,326
{\fs17}It's not supposed to be readable.

{\fs17}Oh, you can tell it's not supposed to be. They're very professional.

{\fs17}Don't you think, Mrs. Wiggs?

{\fs17}Well, Miss Gravely, all I know is nobody buys them.

{\fs17}Just a minute, Mr. Marlow. Well, let me make my position clear.

{\fs17}Hmm? I mean, does it fit?

219
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,920
{\fs17}Is it the right finger size? It's my finger size.

{\fs17}- I'll take it. - Fifteen cents.

{\fs17}That seems a fair price.

223
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,934
{\fs17}What's the finger size got to do with it?

224

{\fs17}Um, I wanted to be certain it would fit a man... a certain size man.

{\fs17}have to show more than your birth certificate to convince a man of that.

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,215
{\fs17}What do you mean? I mean you have to show your character,

{\fs17}Hey! Would you mind getting out of my picture?

259
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:42,031
{\fs17}Huh.

260
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:48,738

261
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:52,298
{\fs17}Oh, don't turn me in. It was an accident... an accident pure and simple.

262
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,468

263
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:57,639
{\fs17}It could've happened to you. Suppose we straighten this whole thing out.

{\fs17}Well, I guess that's the only way out.

265
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:02,611
{\fs17}First thing I seen when I rolled out this morning...

266
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,851
{\fs17}was a double-breasted robin drunk as a hoot owl from eating fermented chokecherries.

267
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:09,859
{\fs17}Right away I knew somebody was in trouble.

268
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:13,192
{\fs17}What I didn't know was that it was me. [Scoffs ]

269
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,631
{\fs17}Well, the larder was empty and I got to thinking about a tooth full of fried rabbit.

270
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,970
{\fs17}It stands to reason that they can't touch you for it.

271
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:23,529
{\fs17}Nothing these days stands to reason.

272
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,667
{\fs17}It was accidental. An act of God, perhaps.

273
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,910
{\fs17}In a way you should be grateful that you were able to do your share...

274
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:34,439
{\fs17}in accomplishing the destiny of a fellow being.

275
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:38,554
{\fs17}Suppose, for instance, it was written in the Book of Heaven...

276
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,556
{\fs17}that this man was to die...

277
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,627
{\fs17}at this particular time, at this particular place.

278
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:48,893
{\fs17}And suppose for a moment that the actual accomplishing of his departure had been bungled...

279
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,900
{\fs17}something had gone wrong.

280
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:53,664
{\fs17}Uh, perhaps it was meant to be a thunderbolt...

281
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:55,762
{\fs17}and there was no thunder available, say.

282
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:58,842
{\fs17}Well, then you come along, and you shoot him...

283
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:04,108
{\fs17}and heaven's will is done and destiny fulfilled.

284
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:07,275
{\fs17}Your conscience is quite clear. You've got nothing to worry about.

285
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,784
{\fs17}Sammy, I haven't got a conscience.

286
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,811
{\fs17}And it's not heaven that's worrying me...

287
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:14,016
{\fs17}because I don't expect I'll ever have to face it.

288
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:16,525
{\fs17}And it's none of those noble things you were talking about. No.

289
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,688
{\fs17}Nothing like that. Then what is it?

290
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,925
{\fs17}[Sighs ] It's me. It's me that's worrying me...

291
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,934
{\fs17}me and my future life.

292
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:26,993
{\fs17}Oh, I know the police and their suspicious ways.

293
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:29,334
{\fs17}You're guilty until you're proved innocent.

294
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,601
{\fs17}And I want nothing more to do with them.

295
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,609
{\fs17}Bury him, I say, and have done with him.

296
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,839
{\fs17}He's no good to anyone now. Lay him to rest.

297
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:39,974
{\fs17}Put him under the sod. Forget him.

298
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,780
{\fs17}I never did it and you never saw him.

299
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:45,083
{\fs17}Yes. What about all those other people who saw him?

300
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:48,147
{\fs17}How about the woman and the little boy, Miss Gravely and the tramp...

301
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,887
{\fs17}and the man who was reading the book... Dr. Greenbow?

302
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:55,694
{\fs17}How about all of them? Well, nobody was interested, I tell you.

303
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,859
{\fs17}Nobody ever cared until you came along.

304
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:02,395
{\fs17}Ah, that's what you think. Suppose someone starts to care after you've buried him?

305
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:05,533
{\fs17}I can't wait for people to start caring whenever they feel like it.

306
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,134
{\fs17}I don't want a little accident to turn into a career.

307
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:11,214
{\fs17}Suppose that woman who called him Harry...

308
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:13,306
{\fs17}Suppose she decides she loves him after all.

309
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,912
{\fs17}She was downright hysterical with delight. Hmm? What was she like?

310
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:21,788
{\fs17}Pretty as a rainbow. Wish I was two years younger.

311
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:24,350
{\fs17}And with a little boy? Yeah, about four or five years of age.

312
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:27,362
{\fs17}Yeah. It's got to be Mrs. Rogers and her son.

313
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:30,433
{\fs17}Sammy, what do you say we slip him underground...

314
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:32,469
{\fs17}now that you've finished drawing him, eh?

315
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:34,733
{\fs17}We could discuss the smaller details later.

316
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:40,038
{\fs17}I don't like it. The authorities like to know when people die.

317
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,841
{\fs17}All right, Sammy. Forget it.

318
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:46,007
{\fs17}You cut off home.

319
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,449
{\fs17}I killed him and I'll look after his remains.

320
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,249
{\fs17}What'll you do? Drag him around the countryside the rest of the day?

321
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:55,553
{\fs17}Oh, I'll do my best. That's all a man can do.

322
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:58,527
{\fs17}If you're not careful, you will get a murder charge lined up.

323
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:00,859
{\fs17}Matter of fact, I'm beginning to suspect something myself.

324
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:04,731
{\fs17}There you are then. See? If you, an artist, suspect the worst,

325
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,293
{\fs17}what are they, the police, going to think?

326
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,828
{\fs17}What about that envelope with his name and address on it?

327
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:12,273
{\fs17}By rights, you should mail him back home.

328
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:18,212
{\fs17}Sam,have you forgot w these letters sent to the post office every night

329
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:21,342
{\fs17}Calvin Wiggs, deputy sheriff.

330
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:27,254
{\fs17}Oh, yes. You're right. I'll tell you what we'll do. Tell you what.

331
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:30,020
{\fs17}We'll find out how well Mrs. Rogers knows this man,

332
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,595
{\fs17}and whether she intends to notify the police of his death.

333
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:36,064
{\fs17}What good will that do? Why, a lot of good.

334
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,067
{\fs17}If she's just a distant friend of his...

335
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:41,434
{\fs17}and doesn't intend to notify the authorities,

336
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:44,268
{\fs17}then I, personally, will help you bury Harry.

337
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:48,277
{\fs17}Oh, Sammy! You've signed on for the cruise.

338
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:50,279
{\fs17}[Chuckles] What time is it?

339
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,775
{\fs17}About noon. Good heavens.

340
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,286
{\fs17}I've got to go home and spruce up. I've got a date with Miss Gravely.

341
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:02,457
{\fs17}Not you. You are not the one.

342
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:07,362
{\fs17}Oh, Sam. She could do a lot worse, you know?

343
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:10,592
{\fs17}Couldn't do any better. Just think.

344
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:14,660
{\fs17}You'd be establishing a precedent. I'm not establishing nothing.

345
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:19,368
{\fs17}I am going over for some blueberry muffins and coffee by her own invitation,

346
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,578
{\fs17}and possibly some elderberry wine.

347
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,878
{\fs17}Do you realize that you'll be the first man to, uh,

348
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,085
{\fs17}cross her threshold?

349
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,751
{\fs17}Oh. Oh, it's not too late, you know. It's...

350
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:38,420
{\fs17}She's a well-preserved woman. I envy you.

351
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:40,986
{\fs17}Yes, very well-preserved.

352
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:44,694
{\fs17}And preserves have to be opened someday.

353
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,702
{\fs17}Hmm? Yes.

354
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,364
{\fs17}Now, you just trot down and see what Mrs. Rogers has to say.

355
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:52,806
{\fs17}How about hiding Harry first? Holy smoke!

356
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,004
{\fs17}Forgetting a little detail like that could hang a man.

357
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:58,013
{\fs17}[Chuckles] Yes.

358
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:37,243
{\fs17}Oh. Oh, I beg your pardon.

359
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,663
{\fs17}[Captain] I hope I never have to be operated on by Dr. Greenbow.

360
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:53,668
{\fs17}Come on. Let's get going. Yeah.

361
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:57,789
{\fs17}Good afternoon.

362
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:00,132
{\fs17}You're beautiful, wonderful.

363
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:03,035
{\fs17}You're the most wonderful, beautiful thing I've ever seen.

364
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,108
{\fs17}I'd like to paint you.

365
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:09,305
{\fs17}Was there something else you wanted, Mr. Marlow, isn't it?

366
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:14,647
{\fs17}You certainly are a lovely woman. I'd like to paint you nude.

367
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,651
{\fs17}Some other time, Mr. Marlow.

368
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:20,348
{\fs17}I was about to make Arnie some lemonade. Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

369
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:22,482
{\fs17}Perhaps I've come at an awkward moment.

370
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,357
{\fs17}If you want to undress me, you have.

371
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,362
{\fs17}Well, it wasn't exactly that.

372
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:31,525
{\fs17}I came here to talk to you about something, but after I saw you, it slipped my mind.

373
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:34,092
{\fs17}It couldn't have been very important then. Guess you're right.

374
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,573
{\fs17}Why don't you sit down on the porch?

375
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:40,006
{\fs17}I'll get you a lemonade and maybe you'll think of it.

376
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,409
{\fs17}You're not only beautiful, you're considerate too.

377
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:46,814
{\fs17}Arnie! Hello, Mr. Marlow!

378
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:48,817
{\fs17}Hi. What do you got? A rabbit?

379
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:52,013
{\fs17}Dead. What have you got?

380
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:57,322
{\fs17}Oh, I got me a little frog. [Yells]

381
00:34:57,394 --> 00:35:00,522
{\fs17}There he is. It's hungry. It needs a mother.

382
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:08,996
{\fs17}- [Mrs. Rogers, Giggling ] - I'll trade ya.

383
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:12,166
{\fs17}Your mother for mine? The rabbit for the frog.

384
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:17,771
{\fs17}It's yours, Arnie. I think you got the best deal.

385
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,816
{\fs17}Dead rabbits don't eat.

386
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,411
{\fs17}Well, I'll just take it in the kitchen and give him some lemonade.

387
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,825
{\fs17}Four rabbit's feet, and he got killed.

388
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:39,163
{\fs17}He should've carried a four-leaf clover too. And a horseshoe.

389
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:42,034
{\fs17}Say, how do rabbits get to be born?

390
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,041
{\fs17}Same way elephants do. Oh, sure.

391
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,771
{\fs17}How come you never came over to visit me before?

392
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:50,779
{\fs17}Didn't know you had such a pretty mother, Arnie.

393
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:54,874
{\fs17}If you think she's pretty, you should see my slingshot.

394
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:59,217
{\fs17}Hmm, perhaps I'll come back tomorrow. When's that?

395
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,884
{\fs17}The day after today. That's yesterday. Today's tomorrow.

396
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:07,623
{\fs17}It was. When was tomorrow yesterday, Mr. Marlow?

397
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:11,968
{\fs17}Today. Oh, sure. Yesterday.

398
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:14,903
{\fs17}You'll never make sense out of Arnie. He's got his own timing.

399
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,436
{\fs17}Thank you.

400
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:25,106
{\fs17}Lemonade, Arnie? I already swiped two glasses.

401
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:29,585
{\fs17}I would've given you two glasses. It's more fun swiped.

402
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:32,315
{\fs17}Can I borrow your rabbit, Mr. Marlow? Sure, Arnie.

403
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:34,323
{\fs17}What are you gonna do with it?

404
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:37,019
{\fs17}You never know when a dead rabbit might come in handy.

405
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,427
{\fs17}It already got me one frog.

406
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:51,306
{\fs17}Arnie! Where are you going now? To make some more trades!

407
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:54,605
{\fs17}Arnie, come home in time for supper. I'll try.

408
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,202
{\fs17}[Horn Honking ] What's your given name?

409
00:36:57,314 --> 00:37:02,911
{\fs17}If you don't want to tell me, just make one up. Jennifer. Jennifer Rogers.

410
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:08,719
{\fs17}Nice. Um, who's the man up on the path?

411
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:11,989
{\fs17}What man? You know, Harry, the dead man.

412
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:17,056
{\fs17}Oh, him. That's my husband.

413
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,068
{\fs17}Your husband's dead then?

414
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:24,771
{\fs17}Is your lemonade sweet enough? Seems to be.

415
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:29,540
{\fs17}I like it tart. Harry is Arnie's father then?

416
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,875
{\fs17}No, Arnie's father's dead. So is Harry.

417
00:37:34,784 --> 00:37:37,685
{\fs17}Thank goodness. He was too good to live.

418
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:40,587
{\fs17}From his looks, he didn't appear to me to be the kind who was too good.

419
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:43,182
{\fs17}Well, he was. Horribly good.

420
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,754
{\fs17}I like your mouth too, especially when you say good.

421
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:54,733
{\fs17}Will you have some more lemonade? Maybe later. Thanks.

422
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:56,772
{\fs17}Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?

423
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,711
{\fs17}He found it. I think Capt. Wiles shot it.

424
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:05,871
{\fs17}I'd like to hear more of your life story, if you don't mind.

425
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:07,882
{\fs17}You see, we don't know quite what to do with Harry.

426
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:10,111
{\fs17}Thought you might have some suggestions.

427
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,553
{\fs17}Hmm. You can stuff him for all I care.

428
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:15,648
{\fs17}Stuff him and put him in a glass case,

429
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:18,592
{\fs17}only I'd suggest frosted glass.

430
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:23,198
{\fs17}What did he do to you, besides marry you?

431
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:29,905
{\fs17}Look, I've wanted to explain about Harry a lot of times,

432
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:35,239
{\fs17}[Church Bells Ringing ] But nobody would understand, least of all Harry.

433
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:41,816
{\fs17}But you... You've got an artistic mind. You can see the finer things.

434
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:44,944
{\fs17}When I'm lucky. Go on. Tell me everything.

435
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:48,616
{\fs17}Let it all out.

436
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:52,217
{\fs17}It was a long time ago and I was in love.

437
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,820
{\fs17}I was too much in love. What was his name?

438
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,831
{\fs17}Robert.

439
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,925
{\fs17}We'd agreed to overlook each other's families and everything and get married.

440
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:01,936
{\fs17}Did you? Oh, yes.

441
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:08,041
{\fs17}And then Robert got killed. Oh?

442
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:12,139
{\fs17}I was heartbroken for six weeks.

443
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,184
{\fs17}Then I discovered little Arnie was on the way.

444
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,653
{\fs17}Must have been a shock. Well, that's where Harry came in.

445
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:23,385
{\fs17}Harry the handsome hero. Harry the saint.

446
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,361
{\fs17}Harry the good. I didn't catch his last name.

447
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,364
{\fs17}Harry Worp, Robert's brother... his older brother.

448
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,366
{\fs17}And he fell in love with you?

449
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:34,437
{\fs17}If he'd have fallen in love with me, I wouldn't have minded.

450
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:38,031
{\fs17}He wanted to marry me because he was Robert's brother and felt noble.

451
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,633
{\fs17}But you thought he was in love with you?

452
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,578
{\fs17}And I decided to let him love me because of Arnie.

453
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:47,276
{\fs17}It was on my second wedding night that I learned the truth.

454
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,948
{\fs17}You didn't learn on your first?

455
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:57,289
{\fs17}[ Dog Barking ] This was a terrible truth...

456
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:00,727
{\fs17}the truth about Harry. Just what happened?

457
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:06,124
{\fs17}- How old are you, Mr. Marlow? - About thirty.

458
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:13,167
{\fs17}This is what happened.

459
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:18,010
{\fs17}I was in the hotel room alone. I put on my best nightie.

460
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:20,548
{\fs17}- You understand? - Perfectly.

461
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,444
{\fs17}Although I had no true feeling for Harry,

462
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:28,719
{\fs17}I had worked myself into a certain enthusiasm because I thought he loved me.

463
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,725
{\fs17}Must have been hard work.

464
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:34,892
{\fs17}There was a full moon, and I sat by the window...

465
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:37,990
{\fs17}because I thought it would show off my new nightie to advantage.

466
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:43,734
{\fs17}- Naturally. - I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

467
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,172
{\fs17}You a perfect stranger too. I'm not boring you, am I?

468
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:49,578
{\fs17}No. No. Not at all.

469
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,374
{\fs17}How about some more lemonade? Uh, soon. Soon.

470
00:40:56,286 --> 00:41:00,245
{\fs17}Oh, where was I? You were sitting by the window because there was a full moon,

471
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,917
{\fs17}and you'd worked yourself up to a certain enthusiasm.

472
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:06,257
{\fs17}I said all that?

473
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,491
{\fs17}Uh, when does Harry come in?

474
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,467
{\fs17}He doesn't. He never came in.

475
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:16,699
{\fs17}He called the following morning. The following morning?

476
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,867
{\fs17}In the hotel lobby the night before, he had bought a magazine.

477
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:22,035
{\fs17}- His horoscope was in it. - Bad?

478
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,411
{\fs17}It said... He was a Taurus.

479
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:28,474
{\fs17}It said, "Don't start any new project that day.

480
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:30,917
{\fs17}It could never be finished."

481
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:35,253
{\fs17}And what did you do? I left him on the spot, and went home to Mother's.

482
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:39,523
{\fs17}- The end. - What a poignant story.

483
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:44,124
{\fs17}I knew you'd understand. Nobody else does. Not even Mother?

484
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,033
{\fs17}Well, she thought I should live with him, but I wouldn't.

485
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:50,664
{\fs17}He pestered me to go back, but I always refused.

486
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,198
{\fs17}Well, suppose some night I wanted him to do something...

487
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,938
{\fs17}like the dishes, for example.

488
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:59,072
{\fs17}His horoscope just wouldn't let him.

489
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:04,018
{\fs17}You're absolutely right. There are some things I just don't like to do by myself.

490
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:07,648
{\fs17}And no one with any true understanding would blame you for it.

491
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:13,653
{\fs17}As soon as Arnie was born, I moved away to where I thought Harry could never find me.

492
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,324
{\fs17}I changed my name and...

493
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,334
{\fs17}But he was persistent?

494
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,836
{\fs17}This morning there was a knock on the door.

495
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:24,669
{\fs17}Before I opened it, I knew he was standing on the other side.

496
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:30,202
{\fs17}What did he want? Me! He wanted me because I was his wife.

497
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,239
{\fs17}He wanted me because, as he put it, he suddenly felt some basic urge

498
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:36,275
{\fs17}loneliness. What'd you feel?

499
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:40,618
{\fs17}I felt sick. Did you see his mustache and his wavy hair?

500
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,658
{\fs17}Yeah, but when I saw him, he was dead.

501
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:46,321
{\fs17}Yeah, he looked exactly the same when he was alive, except he was vertical.

502
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:49,422
{\fs17}So he entered. What'd you say? Nothing.

503
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:52,024
{\fs17}I hit him over the head with a milk bottle and knocked him silly.

504
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:56,834
{\fs17}- Silly? - Bats. Tappy.

505
00:42:56,906 --> 00:43:00,034
{\fs17}He went staggering up towards the woods saying he was gonna find his wife...

506
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:01,974
{\fs17}and drag her home if it killed him.

507
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:04,171

00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:46,329
{\fs17}He'll be comfortably underground before nightfall.

549
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:51,100
{\fs17}All that digging and work. Couldn't you just...

550
00:46:51,205 --> 00:46:54,106
{\fs17}let him slide off the end of your boat pier into the pond?

{\fs17}Never mind, Captain. You're right.

556
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:15,860
{\fs17}Yes. Underground is the best place for Harry.

557
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,817
{\fs17}He seems comfortable, Sam, very comfortable and snug.

{\fs17}Well, let's find a place.

562
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,870
{\fs17}No use making hard work out of it.

563
00:47:57,972 --> 00:47:59,872
{\fs17}We need a place where the earth is soft.

564
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:03,535
{\fs17}Yeah, and a place where the whole town won't stumble over us as we work.

565
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:07,570
{\fs17}Mmm. A place with a certain character and attractiveness.

566
00:48:07,615 --> 00:48:10,914
{\fs17}Facing west so that Harry can watch the setting sun.

567
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:14,113
{\fs17}Where it'll be cozy in winter. And cool in the summer.

568
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:17,783
{\fs17}You know, I'm half envying Harry.

569
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:20,861
{\fs17}It wouldn't take much longer to dig it twice as wide.

570
00:48:20,928 --> 00:48:23,726
{\fs17}Well, thanks for your kindness, but some other time.

571
00:48:29,337 --> 00:48:32,238
{\fs17}Here. This looks like a good place. Ah.

572
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:34,570
{\fs17}You're a lucky fellow, Harry Worp.

573
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:42,910
{\fs17}Come on, Captain. Off with your coat. What, me?

574
00:48:43,017 --> 00:48:44,917
{\fs17}Certainly you. It's your body, isn't it?

575
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:47,180
{\fs17}Oh, I'm not much of a hand at grave digging.

576
00:48:47,255 --> 00:48:50,486
{\fs17}You should've thought of that before you went hunting this morning.

577
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:56,959
{\fs17}Calvin Wiggs. What'll we do now?

578
00:48:57,031 --> 00:48:59,329
{\fs17}Think up the best story he's ever heard.

579
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:27,757
{\fs17}Lay down your shovel, Sam. What's the trouble?

580
00:49:27,862 --> 00:49:32,822
{\fs17}- I'm dead beat. - Good. I was dead beat ten minutes ago.

581
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,494
{\fs17}I wanted to keep digging until you gave up.

582
00:49:42,076 --> 00:49:44,977
{\fs17}Gives me the creeps. Yeah?

583
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:47,708
{\fs17}Come on. Let's get Harry and pop him in.

584
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:56,490
{\fs17}With hasty reverence.

585
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:08,459
{\fs17}Would you like to say a few words, Captain? That I would.

586
00:50:08,535 --> 00:50:11,902
{\fs17}Harry Worp, don't ever show your face around here again!

587
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,306
{\fs17}Let's finish this job and get out of here.

588
00:50:19,413 --> 00:50:23,247
{\fs17}Captain, I think Calvin Wiggs is looking for something.

589
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:25,251
{\fs17}Do you suppose he knows that Harry Worp came up here?

590
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,516
{\fs17}Sammy, that's as horrible a thought as you've ever had.

591
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:30,852
{\fs17}And that he wonders what happened to Harry or where he is?

592
00:50:30,924 --> 00:50:35,725
{\fs17}My only answer is to keep on scraping, and fast.

593
00:50:35,762 --> 00:50:39,721
{\fs17}You know if, if you must kill things from now on, I wish you'd stick to rabbits.

594
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:42,667
{\fs17}The body's smaller. Rabbits! I didn't tell you, did I, Sammy?

595
00:50:42,736 --> 00:50:47,230
{\fs17}I shot a rabbit today! Don't shout. I know you did.

596
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:50,242
{\fs17}I was up at Jennifer Rogers' when Arnie showed me the rabbit.

597
00:50:50,277 --> 00:50:53,974
{\fs17}Jennifer, eh? Didn't waste much time, did you?

598
00:50:54,047 --> 00:50:55,981
{\fs17}Well, I don't blame you, Sammy.

599
00:50:56,049 --> 00:50:58,643
{\fs17}A very nice widow she'll make. Very nice.

600
00:50:58,752 --> 00:51:00,947
{\fs17}Let's discuss her when we've finished with Harry, huh?

601
00:51:01,054 --> 00:51:03,750
{\fs17}No need to get huffy. I don't want to talk about your affairs.

602
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:06,257
{\fs17}I've got affairs of my own.

603
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:08,261
{\fs17}You mean my protege?

604
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:10,559
{\fs17}Come again? Miss Gravely.

605
00:51:10,664 --> 00:51:13,861
{\fs17}The lady that I renovated down at Mrs. Wiggs' this afternoon.

606
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:16,868
{\fs17}A most remarkable reversion to femininity.

607
00:51:16,904 --> 00:51:19,304
{\fs17}I don't quite get you, Sammy boy.

608
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:21,898
{\fs17}She came into the Emporium in rather high excitement.

609
00:51:21,975 --> 00:51:25,172
{\fs17}Wanted a new cup and saucer, lots of other things.

610
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:28,578
{\fs17}I gave her a new makeup and hairdo.

611
00:51:28,682 --> 00:51:30,946
{\fs17}Don't tell me you didn't notice.

612
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:34,146
{\fs17}She's a very nice lady, Sam. Very nice.

613
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:37,816
{\fs17}We're all nice. I don't see how anyone could help but like us.

614
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:40,086
{\fs17}[Sighs] That's just how I feel today.

615
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:42,526
{\fs17}I don't know whether I've grown rose-colored glasses or if...

616
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:44,530
{\fs17}Or, uh, if you're in love?

617
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:46,725
{\fs17}Aha! [Chuckling]

618
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,928
{\fs17}There's nothing like finding yourself in love.

619
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:52,494
{\fs17}No, it adds zest to your work.

620
00:51:52,606 --> 00:51:55,006
{\fs17}Zest! Zest!

621
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:58,239
{\fs17}I think I've had enough zest for a while.

622
00:51:58,312 --> 00:52:02,339
{\fs17}Let's sit down and rest, huh? Why not? We've earned it.

623
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,422
{\fs17}Tell me, Sam, what did Jennifer think of my shooting?

624
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:12,424
{\fs17}You mean Mrs. Rogers? Oh, I think by now...

625
00:52:12,526 --> 00:52:14,756
{\fs17}I'm entitled to be on a first-name basis with her.

626
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:17,626
{\fs17}After all, I brought her a happy release with one bullet.

627
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:20,666
{\fs17}One bullet? How 'bout that "No Shooting" sign that I found?

628
00:52:20,734 --> 00:52:23,726
{\fs17}Well, that. One bullet for the "No Shooting" sign,

629
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,671
{\fs17}one for the beer can and one for Harry.

630
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,436
{\fs17}How about the rabbit? And one for the ra...

631
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:36,349
{\fs17}What's the matter?

632
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,350
{\fs17}What's wrong? What's bitten you?

633
00:52:38,452 --> 00:52:41,012
{\fs17}I only fired three bullets. Three!

634
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:43,750
{\fs17}One for the shooting sign, one for the beer can...

635
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:46,052
{\fs17}And one for the little man who's lying in the grave.

636
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,753
{\fs17}No, Sammy, no. That's just it. One for the rabbit.

637
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:51,262
{\fs17}If I shot the rabbit, I didn't shoot Harry.

638
00:52:51,298 --> 00:52:54,267
{\fs17}Oh, Sammy boy, what have you tried to make me do?

639
00:52:54,368 --> 00:52:56,268
{\fs17}Tried to make a murderer out of me.

640
00:52:58,472 --> 00:53:02,602
{\fs17}Well, don't sit there. Help me! You helped bury him.

641
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:05,042
{\fs17}Even if you didn't kill him, why go digging him up...

642
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:07,205
{\fs17}now that he's so beautifully planted?

643
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,875
{\fs17}I've promised Jennifer that we'd bury him.

644
00:53:09,983 --> 00:53:12,952
{\fs17}Keep my word, he should stay buried.

645
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,853
{\fs17}Besides whether you killed him or not, you've incriminated yourself.

646
00:53:15,922 --> 00:53:20,291
{\fs17}You'll have more of a job explaining away a body you didn't kill and buried...

647
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:23,296
{\fs17}than a body that you killed accidentally and buried.

648
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,231
{\fs17}Right, Captain?

649
00:53:29,903 --> 00:53:32,303
{\fs17}You're not supposed to bury bodies whenever you find them.

650
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:34,306
{\fs17}It makes people suspicious.

651
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:36,876
{\fs17}Supposed to tell the police or advertise or something.

652
00:53:36,943 --> 00:53:40,902
{\fs17}Oh, Sammy, you don't understand. You don't comprehend one bit.

653
00:53:41,014 --> 00:53:44,313
{\fs17}You wouldn't like me to go through my life not knowing if I killed him or not, would you?

654
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,147
{\fs17}Very inconsistent.

655
00:53:49,222 --> 00:53:51,247
{\fs17}First you tell me you've got no conscience.

656
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:53,987
{\fs17}Now you talk about something that sounds remarkably like a conscience.

657
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:56,052
{\fs17}Oh, Sammy, come on. Help me.

658
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:59,257
{\fs17}I don't care if I killed him or not, for all that matters.

659
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:04,293
{\fs17}But I'll get the shakes whenever I see a policeman, and it's no good saying I won't.

660
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:06,339
{\fs17}All right.

661
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,035
{\fs17}If I had my choice, I'd rather be thought a murderer than proved one.

662
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:14,375
{\fs17}With two of us digging, we'll have Harry out of here in nothing flat.

663
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:24,280
{\fs17}Can't see much from here.

664
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:26,383
{\fs17}I'd better get in down there and look at him.

665
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,123
{\fs17}Let me do the honors. All right. You've got good eyes.

666
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:35,228
{\fs17}Hey. That isn't a bullet wound.

667
00:54:35,302 --> 00:54:37,361
{\fs17}"Isn't a bullet wound"? No.

668
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:39,371
{\fs17}What d'ya know?

669
00:54:39,473 --> 00:54:42,203
{\fs17}That's what they call a blow with a blunt instrument.

670
00:54:42,275 --> 00:54:44,971
{\fs17}Huh? What are you thinking, Sammy?

671
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,807
{\fs17}I think, Capt. Wiles, we're tangled up in a murder.

672
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:54,786
{\fs17}Murder. If it's murder, who done it?

673
00:54:54,888 --> 00:54:58,551
{\fs17}- Who "did" it? - That's what I say Who done it?

674
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:02,152
{\fs17}Apart from Jennifer Rogers, who else'd want to kill him?

675
00:55:03,597 --> 00:55:05,497
{\fs17}"Apart from Jennifer"?

676
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,499
{\fs17}Yeah. Do you think that she would...

677
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:09,501
{\fs17}Oh, it's ridiculous.

678
00:55:09,603 --> 00:55:12,094
{\fs17}You said she was surprised to see the body when she came up here.

679
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:14,730
{\fs17}You said she hit him on the head.

680
00:55:14,808 --> 00:55:17,299
{\fs17}Coming home from Madagascar once, we had a fireman on board...

681
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:20,141
{\fs17}who hit his head on a brick wall and died two days later.

682
00:55:20,213 --> 00:55:22,647
{\fs17}Where could he find a brick wall on board a ship?

683
00:55:22,716 --> 00:55:25,708
{\fs17}That's what we always wondered.

684
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,715
{\fs17}[Sighs] Couldn't have been Jennifer. No.

685
00:55:30,824 --> 00:55:33,156
{\fs17}Besides, what's it matter who did it?

686
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:35,660
{\fs17}It'll be better for all of us if he's buried and out of the way.

687
00:55:35,729 --> 00:55:39,631
{\fs17}Nothing doing. I'm not burying someone else's bad habits.

688
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:42,191
{\fs17}Hmm? Suppose it was Miss Gravely?

689
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:45,568
{\fs17}What? [Laughing]

690
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:48,130
{\fs17}No, it's not as funny as all that.

691
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:50,573
{\fs17}You said yourself she wasn't particularly startled...

692
00:55:50,644 --> 00:55:52,578
{\fs17}to see you dragging Harry up the path.

693
00:55:52,646 --> 00:55:55,740
{\fs17}You artists have got no idea of etiquette.

694
00:55:55,849 --> 00:55:58,317
{\fs17}Miss Gravely is a lady of gentle habits and upbringing.

695
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:01,354
{\fs17}A lady to hide her feelings. If I hadn't been holding Harry by the ankles,

696
00:56:01,455 --> 00:56:03,548
{\fs17}I don't suppose she'd have mentioned him at all.

697
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:06,888
{\fs17}- Really? - Nah! When she said,

698
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,451
{\fs17}"What seems to be the trouble, Captain?"

699
00:56:09,563 --> 00:56:11,963
{\fs17}It was nothing more than a pleasantry, so to speak.

700
00:56:12,065 --> 00:56:16,092
{\fs17}Like, "Nice day, isn't it?" "I'm sure, yes."

701
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:18,103
{\fs17}Or something like that.

702
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:20,571
{\fs17}Going to help me bury him again?

703
00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:24,303
{\fs17}Um... I don't know.

704
00:56:24,377 --> 00:56:27,778
{\fs17}'Course, it might have been Dr. Greenbow or the tramp or...

705
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:32,079
{\fs17}OrJennifer? I told you it couldn't...

706
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:35,586
{\fs17}Well, no point in arguing about it. Let's get rid of him.

707
00:56:37,591 --> 00:56:42,494
{\fs17}All right. You've helped me in my hour of need. I guess it's up to me to help you.

708
00:56:42,596 --> 00:56:45,360
{\fs17}We'll file Harry away once and for all. Yeah.

709
00:56:45,432 --> 00:56:47,400
{\fs17}No more nonsense about it.

710
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:16,024
{\fs17}Come aboard, Miss Gravely, come aboard.

711
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:18,791
{\fs17}It's just an old salt's snug anchorage.

712
00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:22,596
{\fs17}Small, not palatial like yours. But homely, very home...

713
00:57:38,552 --> 00:57:40,543
{\fs17}Won't you sit down, Miss Gravely?

714
00:57:40,654 --> 00:57:42,554
{\fs17}Thank you.

715
00:57:44,758 --> 00:57:49,718
{\fs17}It's funny, you know. Funny how we got to be so friendly in one afternoon.

716
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:53,961
{\fs17}I knew you weren't as prim and starchy as they made out.

717
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:56,035
{\fs17}[Chuckling ] Not by a long shot.

718
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:58,070
{\fs17}Really? NO.

719
00:57:58,104 --> 00:58:01,232
{\fs17}I'm a man who can recognize the human qualities in a woman.

720
00:58:01,308 --> 00:58:03,708
{\fs17}When I first saw you down where Harry was...

721
00:58:03,777 --> 00:58:06,075
{\fs17}Capt. Wiles. Yes, ma'am?

722
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:09,342
{\fs17}Before you make your kind thoughts known to me, I...

723
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:13,113
{\fs17}should like to offer you some explanation of my sudden invitation...

724
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:15,916
{\fs17}to coffee and blueberry muffins this afternoon...

725
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:19,152
{\fs17}and my... and my sitting with you here now.

726
00:58:19,225 --> 00:58:21,386
{\fs17}No, ma'am, you don't have to explain anything.

727
00:58:21,494 --> 00:58:25,555
{\fs17}You came to my aid at a moment of crisis, for which I'm truly grateful.

728
00:58:25,632 --> 00:58:29,932
{\fs17}Thank you, but it's just that I owe you some reason.

729
00:58:30,003 --> 00:58:32,437
{\fs17}No, no, no. I won't hear a word of it.

730
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:35,906
{\fs17}You saw the predicament I was in with that body on my hands and all,

731
00:58:35,942 --> 00:58:39,605
{\fs17}and you shut your eyes to it in a most sporting fashion, if I may say so.

732
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:42,011
{\fs17}Capt. Wiles. Yes, ma'am?

733
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:46,074
{\fs17}I'm trying to tell you that the reason I asked you to coffee and blueberry muffins...

734
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:48,620
{\fs17}was because... I felt...

735
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:50,850
{\fs17}Sympathy. Gratitude.

736
00:58:50,924 --> 00:58:53,859
{\fs17}Gra... But I'm the one who should be grateful.

737
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:58,887
{\fs17}No, I was grateful. L... I am grateful.

738
00:58:58,932 --> 00:59:03,062
{\fs17}I'm grateful to you for burying my body.

739
00:59:08,341 --> 00:59:10,275
{\fs17}Your body?

740
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:12,937
{\fs17}The man you thought you killed...

741
00:59:13,046 --> 00:59:17,449
{\fs17}was the man I hit over the head with the leather heel of my hiking shoe.

742
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:19,748
{\fs17}You?

743
00:59:19,853 --> 00:59:23,050
{\fs17}- And with a metal cleat on the end of it. - But why?

744
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,892
{\fs17}He annoyed me.

745
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,554
{\fs17}I was walking towards home when he...

746
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,154
{\fs17}suddenly came at me with a wild look in his eye...

747
00:59:32,265 --> 00:59:35,393
{\fs17}and insisted... we were married.

748
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:37,766
{\fs17}Oh, then you'd known each other before.

749
00:59:37,871 --> 00:59:40,897
{\fs17}Believe it or not, I had never seen him before in my life,

750
00:59:40,974 --> 00:59:44,910
{\fs17}and... if I ever had, I never would have married him.

751
00:59:44,978 --> 00:59:47,469
{\fs17}He must have mistaken you for someone else.

752
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:51,516
{\fs17}No, he definitely... pulled me into the bushes.

753
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:53,677
{\fs17}Yes?

754
00:59:53,787 --> 00:59:57,951
{\fs17}- I came out again. - Go on.

755
00:59:58,024 --> 01:00:01,585
{\fs17}He pulled me back.

756
01:00:01,695 --> 01:00:03,595
{\fs17}Twice.

757
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:07,189
{\fs17}He swore at me... horrible, masculine sounds.

758
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,200
{\fs17}I didn't understand them, of course.

759
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:12,271
{\fs17}Of course you didn't.

760
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:14,863
{\fs17}- We fought. - Then what?

761
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:21,269
{\fs17}I won. My shoe had come off in the struggle, and I hit him.

762
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:24,874
{\fs17}I hit him as hard as ever I could.

763
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:30,022
{\fs17}You killed him.

764
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:35,622
{\fs17}I must have done it. I was annoyed, Captain.

765
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,958
{\fs17}Very annoyed. Naturally.

766
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:42,297
{\fs17}I don't think I've ever been so annoyed.

767
01:00:42,368 --> 01:00:47,237
{\fs17}Consequently, I, I didn't realize my own capabilities.

768
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,673
{\fs17}Whew! Seems to me...

769
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:53,736
{\fs17}Mrs. Rogers knocked him silly, and you finished him off.

770
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:56,816
{\fs17}Why should Mrs. Rogers knock him silly?

771
01:00:56,883 --> 01:00:59,215
{\fs17}She was really his wife.

772
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:03,881
{\fs17}Poor woman. I thought she had better taste.

773
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:07,492
{\fs17}You know, Captain,

774
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,553
{\fs17}when I ran away I decided I would never tell a soul what happened.

775
01:01:11,664 --> 01:01:14,258
{\fs17}Then I met you, and I thought...

776
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:19,669
{\fs17}how convenient it was that you should think that you had shot him.

777
01:01:19,773 --> 01:01:23,106
{\fs17}- You must forgive me for thinking that. - Only natural.

778
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:27,806
{\fs17}That's why I felt... I still feel under an obligation to you.

779
01:01:27,881 --> 01:01:30,782
{\fs17}Oh, not at all. Let's forget it.

780
01:01:30,884 --> 01:01:34,718
{\fs17}No, we mustn't do that. It would hardly be fair to you...

781
01:01:34,788 --> 01:01:39,782
{\fs17}I mean, for you to go through life knowing that you had buried a man you didn't kill.

782
01:01:39,893 --> 01:01:42,361
{\fs17}You would have my crime on your conscience.

783
01:01:42,428 --> 01:01:45,397
{\fs17}It's a pleasure, [Hiccups] I'm sure.

784
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:47,558
{\fs17}But no.

785
01:01:47,634 --> 01:01:51,593
{\fs17}Now I realize that Harry man was out of his mind, and...

786
01:01:51,638 --> 01:01:54,300
{\fs17}my action was justifiable,

787
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:57,376
{\fs17}there's no reason we shouldn't let the authorities know about it.

788
01:01:57,443 --> 01:02:01,004
{\fs17}The authorities? Then everything will be cleared up nicely.

789
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:03,912
{\fs17}I'm sure Calvin Wiggs and the police...

790
01:02:04,017 --> 01:02:06,542
{\fs17}won't make a fuss about it when we explain.

791
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:09,918
{\fs17}Perhaps it needn't get into the papers at all. Don't you believe it, ma'am.

792
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:12,355
{\fs17}They love it, the papers, this kind of thing.

793
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:14,916
{\fs17}Murder and passion.

794
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:17,622
{\fs17}You let Harry be. Just forget it ever happened,

795
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,530
{\fs17}the same as Sammy and me and Jennifer Rogers are going to do.

796
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:26,230
{\fs17}Oh, but... but it isn't your body.

797
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:30,833
{\fs17}After all, I killed him, so it's only fair that I should have the say-so.

798
01:02:30,944 --> 01:02:33,037
{\fs17}Yes, but... Well, in a way... DOn't yOu agree?

799
01:02:33,146 --> 01:02:36,638
{\fs17}I thought you would. I tell you what, Captain.

800
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:42,154
{\fs17}We'll go and get a spade now. But, ma'am...

801
01:02:42,188 --> 01:02:45,055
{\fs17}And after we've dug him up, we'll go back to my place...

802
01:02:45,158 --> 01:02:47,592
{\fs17}and I'll make you some hot chocolate.

803
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:31,600
{\fs17}Arnie's so tired he'll sleep all day and half the night.

804
01:03:31,704 --> 01:03:34,332
{\fs17}I think you've got a pretty house,Jennifer.

805
01:03:34,407 --> 01:03:37,706
{\fs17}It's the best I could do on Robert's insurance.

806
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,074
{\fs17}Sugar? No, black, thanks.

807
01:03:50,657 --> 01:03:52,625
{\fs17}It's funny, but...

808
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:56,117
{\fs17}I feel awful comfortable with you, Sam.

809
01:03:58,364 --> 01:04:00,855
{\fs17}You know, I feel the same way too.

810
01:04:00,934 --> 01:04:02,925
{\fs17}It's a good feeling,

811
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:06,437
{\fs17}feeling comfortable with someone who feels that way too.

812
01:04:10,443 --> 01:04:12,934
{\fs17}There is one thing I feel uncomfortable about.

813
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:16,379
{\fs17}Tell me what it is, and I'll take care of it for you.

814
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:18,383
{\fs17}It's Harry? What about Harry?

815
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:21,215
{\fs17}Harry? Don't you think about Harry.

816
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:24,552
{\fs17}Harry's part of the earth. He's with eternity, the ages.

817
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:26,852
{\fs17}Take my word for it. Harry's ancient history.

818
01:04:28,962 --> 01:04:31,123
{\fs17}Come in, whoever it is.

819
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,568
{\fs17}What happened? [Sighs]

820
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:39,137
{\fs17}Sam, I've got Something to tell you.

821
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:42,766
{\fs17}No, Captain, I have something to tell him.

822
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:45,275
{\fs17}Now who's going to tell what?

823
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:51,214
{\fs17}I killed Harry Worp with the leather heel of my hiking shoe.

824
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:57,652
{\fs17}- So it was you. - We're on our way to get Calvin Wiggs,

825
01:04:57,724 --> 01:05:01,057
{\fs17}and have him call the state police. I keep telling her there's no need.

826
01:05:01,127 --> 01:05:05,291
{\fs17}He's right and, uh, besides, it'd be indecent. Harry's dead and buried.

827
01:05:05,398 --> 01:05:07,593
{\fs17}Sam, I've got something to tell you.

828
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:10,735
{\fs17}You haven't dug him up again.

829
01:05:10,803 --> 01:05:12,896
{\fs17}Well, l...

830
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:22,112
{\fs17}I insisted, Mr. Marlow.

831
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:24,547
{\fs17}Don't you understand?

832
01:05:24,617 --> 01:05:28,917
{\fs17}You have nothing to fear. It's my concern entirely.

833
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:33,322
{\fs17}As soon as Capt. Wiles told me the full circumstances of his being here,

834
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,327
{\fs17}I knew there was nothing for me to hide.

835
01:05:35,361 --> 01:05:37,522
{\fs17}You know all about Harry?

836
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,030
{\fs17}I'm afraid I do, Mrs. Rogers, and...

837
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:43,866
{\fs17}and after all, nobody could possibly gossip about a lady and a maniac.

838
01:05:43,936 --> 01:05:45,870
{\fs17}You'd be surprised.

839
01:05:45,938 --> 01:05:48,839
{\fs17}You don't quite understand what murder involves, Miss Gravely.

840
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,469
{\fs17}It'd be hours and hours of questioning and photographs,

841
01:05:51,544 --> 01:05:54,536
{\fs17}and the whole of your private life spread indecently in the newspapers.

842
01:05:56,849 --> 01:06:00,046
{\fs17}What makes you think my private life is indecent?

843
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:03,281
{\fs17}I didn't mean that. I meant that the way they pry is indecent.

844
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:08,020
{\fs17}They'll hound you to death. There'll be newspapermen, photographers, detectives.

845
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:11,325
{\fs17}- I've made up my mind. - She certainly has.

846
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:14,195
{\fs17}It was Capt. Wiles here who persuaded me to call...

847
01:06:14,267 --> 01:06:17,327
{\fs17}and tell Mrs. Rogers what I proposed to do.

848
01:06:17,403 --> 01:06:21,499
{\fs17}After all, she is most closely connected with the business.

849
01:06:21,574 --> 01:06:24,407
{\fs17}What do you think about it, Mrs. Rogers?

850
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:27,469
{\fs17}I can't see why you're all making such a fuss about Harry.

851
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:31,141
{\fs17}If he was buried, I don't see why you had to dig him up.

852
01:06:31,217 --> 01:06:34,482
{\fs17}But since you have, I guess you'd better do what you think best.

853
01:06:34,587 --> 01:06:38,023
{\fs17}I don't care what you do with Harry, as long as you don't bring him back to life.

854
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:43,219
{\fs17}- I have a free hand, then. - Free as a bird.

855
01:06:43,296 --> 01:06:45,730
{\fs17}As far as I'm concerned, it's ancient history.

856
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:47,959
{\fs17}Wait a minute,Jennifer.

857
01:06:48,034 --> 01:06:50,366
{\fs17}I think we've forgotten something.

858
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:53,530
{\fs17}Do you realize if this thing comes out, that all the details of your marriage...

859
01:06:53,606 --> 01:06:55,801
{\fs17}will be public property?

860
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:02,411
{\fs17}- Oh. - I must confess, I hadn't thought of that, either.

861
01:07:02,515 --> 01:07:06,144
{\fs17}- Where'd you put Harry this time? - Over by the big oak tree.

862
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:08,312
{\fs17}I'll get my shovel.

863
01:07:08,421 --> 01:07:11,049
{\fs17}I'm afraid I'm causing you rather a lot of hard work.

864
01:07:11,124 --> 01:07:13,115
{\fs17}I'm sorry. Not at all, not at all.

865
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:16,128
{\fs17}Well, let's all go up there.

866
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,590
{\fs17}You know, I've never been to a homemade funeral before.

867
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:24,193
{\fs17}[Chuckles] I have.

868
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,000
{\fs17}This is my third.

869
01:07:27,073 --> 01:07:29,405
{\fs17}All in one day.

870
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:39,139
{\fs17}[Sam ] Well, let's get it over with.

871
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:41,153
{\fs17}Yes.

872
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,394
{\fs17}[Captain] I think we ought to cement it over.

873
01:07:55,468 --> 01:07:58,926
{\fs17}[Miss Gravely] Next spring I'll set out some blueberry bushes.

874
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:01,735
{\fs17}[Captain] Couldn't you make it something else? Lilacs maybe?

875
01:08:01,807 --> 01:08:03,775
{\fs17}[Sam] I think nature'll take good care of it.

876
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:07,768
{\fs17}How about a little service? [Sam] I can't think of anything to say.

877
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,974
{\fs17}Besides, my arms ache. [Jennifer] It's too late to say prayers.

878
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:14,382
{\fs17}Besides, wherever he was going, he's there now.

879
01:08:14,487 --> 01:08:16,546
{\fs17}Bye, Harry. I forgive you.

880
01:08:25,298 --> 01:08:27,698
{\fs17}[Captain] Trumpets welcoming Harry.

881
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,201
{\fs17}You didn't know Harry. I'd like to paint you like that,Jennifer.

882
01:08:31,237 --> 01:08:33,467
{\fs17}You look beautiful, glistening in the moonlight.

883
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:37,509
{\fs17}[Captain] Sounds as if it's coming down from near the village.

884
01:08:37,543 --> 01:08:39,511
{\fs17}[Miss Gravely] I know what it is.

885
01:08:39,545 --> 01:08:41,536
{\fs17}It's the call of the phantom stagecoach...

886
01:08:41,614 --> 01:08:46,017
{\fs17}that used to pass by here each night 2OO years ago. Phantom coach?

887
01:08:46,118 --> 01:08:49,315
{\fs17}The old turnpike used to run across those foothills over there.

888
01:08:49,422 --> 01:08:52,220
{\fs17}[Sam] Oh, to be a highwayman on a night like this.

889
01:08:52,325 --> 01:08:54,555
{\fs17}[Jennifer] Listen. Somebody's running. [ Indistinct Shouting ]

890
01:08:54,627 --> 01:08:57,357
{\fs17}Horses? If it's a horse, it's learned how to shout.

891
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:00,695
{\fs17}What's she saying? We'll know in a minute. She's coming this way.

892
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:05,567
{\fs17}Sam Marlow! It's Wiggy. Old Wiggy.

893
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:11,733
{\fs17}Mr. Marlow! Mr. Marlow!

894
01:09:11,844 --> 01:09:15,405
{\fs17}Wiggy, what on earth do you want? L... He... You... Wants...

895
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:17,676
{\fs17}Catch your breath. He's a millionaire.

896
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,878
{\fs17}Who? He wants to buy your pictures, Mr. Marlow.

897
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,183
{\fs17}Which pictures? All of'em and more besides.

898
01:09:23,256 --> 01:09:25,520
{\fs17}He says you're a genius.

899
01:09:25,591 --> 01:09:28,856
{\fs17}He's right, but it's hard to believe he wants to buy all my pictures.

900
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:31,521
{\fs17}[Miss Gravely] I'd be too curious to refuse at least to talk to him.

901
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:34,088
{\fs17}[Wiggy] Don't turn down a good chance.

902
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:36,600
{\fs17}All right, I'll talk to him.

903
01:09:38,471 --> 01:09:41,372
{\fs17}We're digging sassafras root. [Wiggy] Sassafras tea's mighty good for you.

904
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:44,672
{\fs17}Mr. Wiggs always swore it cured his arthritis just before he died.

905
01:09:44,777 --> 01:09:46,677
{\fs17}[Captain] How much does the millionaire want to pay?

906
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:51,682
{\fs17}I asked seven dollars for that one looks like a lot of blobs of color in a thunderstorm.

907
01:09:51,717 --> 01:09:53,844
{\fs17}[Sam] And? Said he couldn't think of it. Said they were priceless.

908
01:09:53,919 --> 01:09:57,047
{\fs17}[Captain] Sounds like something I painted in kindergarten.

909
01:09:57,123 --> 01:09:59,921
{\fs17}[Sam] I'll have you know that picture's symbolic of the beginning of the world.

910
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:03,587
{\fs17}[Captain] That's where I first heard of the world, at kindergarten.

911
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,328
{\fs17}Yes, and my friend here, art critic for the Modern Museum...

912
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:11,598
{\fs17}Don't think I'm rude, but it doesn't matter to me what an art critic says.

913
01:10:11,704 --> 01:10:15,140
{\fs17}Is that so? I know my paintings are good.

914
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:18,643
{\fs17}He doesn't want them; you do. So all that matters is what you think.

915
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:22,909
{\fs17}I think they are works of genius, and I want to buy them all.

916
01:10:24,517 --> 01:10:26,917
{\fs17}Too bad. Why?

917
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:30,648
{\fs17}Just decided I can't sell them. Besides, you couldn't afford them.

918
01:10:30,723 --> 01:10:32,714
{\fs17}Oh.

919
01:10:32,825 --> 01:10:35,726
{\fs17}Uh... Money.

920
01:10:35,828 --> 01:10:39,764
{\fs17}Sammy. Don't be a fool. Make him pay through the nose.

921
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:42,824
{\fs17}Go ahead, Mr. Marlow. Be reasonable.

922
01:10:42,935 --> 01:10:44,994
{\fs17}Be unreasonable, if you want.

923
01:10:45,071 --> 01:10:47,039
{\fs17}What do you say?

924
01:10:50,276 --> 01:10:52,767
{\fs17}It's your genius. It's up to you.

925
01:10:56,649 --> 01:10:59,948
{\fs17}All right then. What do you like most in the whole world?

926
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:05,351
{\fs17}I don't know. Strawberries, I guess.

927
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:08,360
{\fs17}Strawberries. Write that down.

928
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:12,160
{\fs17}Two boxes of fresh strawberries, first of each month, in and out of season...

929
01:11:12,264 --> 01:11:14,164
{\fs17}from now on.

930
01:11:14,266 --> 01:11:16,666
{\fs17}Well, it's simple. What else?

931
01:11:16,702 --> 01:11:18,863
{\fs17}What would Arnie like?

932
01:11:20,206 --> 01:11:22,174
{\fs17}A chemical set.

933
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:25,700
{\fs17}What kind? Whatever smells the worst.

934
01:11:25,778 --> 01:11:28,212
{\fs17}Got that? Right.

935
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,874
{\fs17}One smelly chemical set.

936
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:33,042
{\fs17}Wiggy. Wiggy, what would you like?

937
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,849
{\fs17}Cash register. Chromium plated. One that rings a bell.

938
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:38,389
{\fs17}Got room for one? I'll find room.

939
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:41,221
{\fs17}Cash register. Chromium plated. One that rings a bell?

940
01:11:41,293 --> 01:11:43,227
{\fs17}Check.

941
01:11:43,295 --> 01:11:46,287
{\fs17}Miss Gravely, a beauty parlor, fully equipped?

942
01:11:46,332 --> 01:11:48,562
{\fs17}What for?

943
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:53,333
{\fs17}A hope chest... filled with the things I should have put in it and didn't.

944
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:57,069
{\fs17}A hope chest, full of hope.

945
01:11:57,143 --> 01:11:59,475
{\fs17}Captain?

946
01:11:59,545 --> 01:12:02,776
{\fs17}A good shotgun, plenty of ammunition,

947
01:12:02,848 --> 01:12:08,150
{\fs17}some corduroy britches, a plain shirt and a hunting cap, a brown one.

948
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:11,719
{\fs17}Davy Crockett... the works.

949
01:12:11,824 --> 01:12:15,419
{\fs17}Well, that's it, I guess. The paintings are yours.

950
01:12:15,528 --> 01:12:17,428
{\fs17}Yes, but what about you?

951
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:20,055
{\fs17}Yes, Sam, you've gotta ask for something.

952
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:22,066
{\fs17}Well, let's see.

953
01:12:25,438 --> 01:12:28,271
{\fs17}That's it.

954
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,968
{\fs17}- What's it? - Pardon me.

955
01:12:35,948 --> 01:12:37,848
{\fs17}What do you think?

956
01:12:40,553 --> 01:12:43,613
{\fs17}Yes, I think that can be easily arranged.

957
01:12:46,559 --> 01:12:48,686
{\fs17}Well. That's it, then.

958
01:12:48,761 --> 01:12:51,753
{\fs17}I'll come back in the morning for all these paintings.

959
01:12:51,797 --> 01:12:54,766
{\fs17}Mr. Marlow, this has been a night...

960
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,030
{\fs17}that I shall remember the rest of my life.

961
01:12:57,102 --> 01:13:00,196
{\fs17}Come back again. Have some more paintings for you next month.

962
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:03,366
{\fs17}And you'll have a steady customer in me,

963
01:13:03,476 --> 01:13:06,036
{\fs17}even if you raise your prices.

964
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:08,170
{\fs17}Well, good night, everyone.

965
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,180
{\fs17}Good night. Good night.

966
01:13:10,282 --> 01:13:12,307
{\fs17}All right, young man. [Millionaire Clears Throat]

967
01:13:17,223 --> 01:13:19,555
{\fs17}[Captain ] Congratulations, Sammy. Good boy.

968
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:23,356
{\fs17}Did I do the right thing? You did just the right thing, Sam.

969
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:26,694
{\fs17}Good.

970
01:13:26,799 --> 01:13:29,290
{\fs17}Because it's important to me that you think so.

971
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:31,301
{\fs17}Why?

972
01:13:31,403 --> 01:13:33,803
{\fs17}Because I love you. I want to marry you.

973
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:37,999
{\fs17}Oh! [Chuckling]

974
01:13:41,714 --> 01:13:44,410
{\fs17}You want to marry me? Um-hmm. Why not?

975
01:13:46,852 --> 01:13:49,821
{\fs17}Because... Because I just got my freedom today.

976
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:52,390
{\fs17}Easy come, easy go.

977
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:55,325
{\fs17}Besides, if you married me, you'd keep your freedom.

978
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:00,155
{\fs17}You must be practically unique, then.

979
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:04,362
{\fs17}I respect freedom. More than that, I love freedom.

980
01:14:04,436 --> 01:14:07,530
{\fs17}We might be the only free married couple in the world.

981
01:14:11,377 --> 01:14:13,845
{\fs17}This is very sudden, Sam.

982
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,848
{\fs17}You'll have to give me a little time to think about it.

983
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:24,855
{\fs17}Only fair. I'll give you until we get back to your house.

984
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:34,824
{\fs17}- What's goin' on here this time of night? - The most wonderful thing.

985
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,494
{\fs17}Mr. Marlow sold all his paintings to a millionaire.

986
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:40,061
{\fs17}Got more'n I ever figured he'd get. Money?

987
01:14:40,172 --> 01:14:43,630
{\fs17}Well, not exactly money.

988
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:46,610
{\fs17}I always knew they weren't worth the space.

989
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:50,012
{\fs17}I found these on a tramp hangin' 'round here.

990
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:53,415
{\fs17}Said he found 'em. On a... dead man.

991
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,415
{\fs17}Took me to where he said he found him, and...

992
01:14:58,724 --> 01:15:00,692
{\fs17}I didn't see any body.

993
01:15:03,796 --> 01:15:06,856
{\fs17}Montpelier 2000.

994
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:09,696
{\fs17}[ Wiggy ] That's the state police number. Uh-huh.

995
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:12,828
{\fs17}I think, uh, we'd better get going.

996
01:15:12,905 --> 01:15:15,430
{\fs17}Thank you, Mr. Marlow, for the cash register.

997
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:17,441
{\fs17}It was a pleasure. Good night.

998
01:15:17,509 --> 01:15:19,670
{\fs17}Good night. Good night. Good night.

999
01:15:19,745 --> 01:15:21,713
{\fs17}Good night.

1000
01:15:21,747 --> 01:15:23,715
{\fs17}Good night. Good night, Captain.

1001
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:30,113
{\fs17}[ Door Closes ] This is Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs.

1002
01:15:30,222 --> 01:15:32,122
{\fs17}Yeah, I'll wait.

1003
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:52,135
{\fs17}Ma?

1004
01:15:52,244 --> 01:15:56,078
{\fs17}- Yes? - This picture here on the floor.

1005
01:15:56,148 --> 01:16:00,175
{\fs17}It's a new one. He did it today, but it isn't for sale.

1006
01:16:00,252 --> 01:16:03,346
{\fs17}Why not? You'll have to ask him that.

1007
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:07,050
{\fs17}He left it on his way over to Jennifer Rogers' house.

1008
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:10,060
{\fs17}Guess he didn't have time to take it home.

1009
01:16:12,164 --> 01:16:14,598
{\fs17}You suddenly got interested in art?

1010
01:16:15,768 --> 01:16:18,532
{\fs17}No.

1011
01:16:18,604 --> 01:16:21,869
{\fs17}It's just that it matches the description of...

1012
01:16:21,974 --> 01:16:24,670
{\fs17}Oh, hello, Sergeant.

1013
01:16:24,777 --> 01:16:26,677
{\fs17}Calvin Wiggs.

1014
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:29,407
{\fs17}Got something that might interest you a little.

1015
01:16:29,481 --> 01:16:33,577
{\fs17}It seems I picked up this tramp with a pair of stolen shoes...

1016
01:16:33,686 --> 01:16:36,120
{\fs17}and a wild story about a corpse.

1017
01:16:56,842 --> 01:16:59,936
{\fs17}What do you think? Him walking in with Harry Worp's shoes...

1018
01:17:00,012 --> 01:17:03,140
{\fs17}in his hand and then that phone call to the police.

1019
01:17:03,215 --> 01:17:05,706
{\fs17}Don't know. I may be wrong,

1020
01:17:05,818 --> 01:17:07,843
{\fs17}but I don't think he's tied us into it yet.

1021
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,218
{\fs17}Oh, the way he looked at me.

1022
01:17:10,322 --> 01:17:12,756
{\fs17}If he'd known anything, he'd have kept us there.

1023
01:17:12,825 --> 01:17:17,387
{\fs17}But modern police methods are all psychological now, Sammy. Psychological.

1024
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:22,264
{\fs17}They just wear you down and wear you down until...

1025
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:25,326
{\fs17}you're almost grateful to get into that gas chamber.

1026
01:17:26,872 --> 01:17:31,741
{\fs17}The police'll probably tell him, if the shoes fit, to keep them.

1027
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:34,371
{\fs17}Oh, well.

1028
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:47,621
{\fs17}I've decided, Sam. Decided what?

1029
01:17:47,693 --> 01:17:49,661
{\fs17}I will marry you,

1030
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:52,163
{\fs17}if you haven't forgotten about asking me.

1031
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:57,396
{\fs17}I'm... I'm very fond of you and,

1032
01:17:57,469 --> 01:17:59,869
{\fs17}I think you'd make a good father for Arnie...

1033
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:05,976
{\fs17}and for some other reasons best left unsaid.

1034
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:09,247
{\fs17}Marriage is the comfortable way to spend the winter,

1035
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:13,307
{\fs17}but right now we should be working on some good story to satisfy the state police...

1036
01:18:13,385 --> 01:18:16,320
{\fs17}if they should turn up.

1037
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:20,484
{\fs17}Would you believe it? I'd almost forgotten that proposal.

1038
01:18:20,592 --> 01:18:24,119
{\fs17}I have witnesses, Sam. Oh, I remember now.

1039
01:18:24,196 --> 01:18:28,155
{\fs17}All right, you've got yourself a husband.

1040
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:30,428
{\fs17}I think I'll kiss you now to prove it.

1041
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:42,044
{\fs17}Lightly, Sam. I have a very short fuse.

1042
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:54,083
{\fs17}What a pretty sight.

1043
01:19:01,066 --> 01:19:04,866
{\fs17}Sam, what did you ask the millionaire for?

1044
01:19:11,777 --> 01:19:13,745
{\fs17}That's very practical.

1045
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:20,482
{\fs17}Congratulations, my dear.

1046
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:23,988
{\fs17}You're a lucky man, Sammy. I think you'll both be very happy.

1047
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:25,990
{\fs17}Thank you. If I grumbled too much...

1048
01:19:26,058 --> 01:19:29,721
{\fs17}at my share of the work in burying Harry, I'm sorry.

1049
01:19:29,795 --> 01:19:31,922
{\fs17}I can see now it was well worth it.

1050
01:19:31,997 --> 01:19:35,797
{\fs17}And if I can do anything else... Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1051
01:19:39,504 --> 01:19:43,964
{\fs17}- What's wrong, Sam? - Harry. We're not quite finished with him yet.

1052
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:47,807
{\fs17}Sam, if anybody's through, it's Harry. He's been buried three times.

1053
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,280
{\fs17}Before we can get married, you're gonna have to prove that you're free.

1054
01:19:50,382 --> 01:19:54,341
{\fs17}To prove you're free, you'll have to prove that Harry... Is dead.

1055
01:19:55,787 --> 01:20:00,815
{\fs17}- What a horrible complication. - Oh!

1056
01:20:00,893 --> 01:20:04,158
{\fs17}I don't know that it is.

1057
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:06,493
{\fs17}What are you looking at me for?

1058
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:12,263
{\fs17}Sammy, I'll do anything to help you, but please,

1059
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:15,101
{\fs17}please don't ask me to dig up Harry again!

1060
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:18,506
{\fs17}- Oh, come, come now, Captain. - No, we can't.

1061
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,511
{\fs17}If you're thinking of the bad publicity... NO, I'm nOt.

1062
01:20:22,915 --> 01:20:26,749
{\fs17}I think Sam would be worth just about anything.

1063
01:20:26,818 --> 01:20:29,218
{\fs17}I'm thinking of you, Miss Gravely.

1064
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:34,349
{\fs17}Murder is murder, no matter how exonerating the circumstances and...

1065
01:20:34,426 --> 01:20:36,724
{\fs17}It just wouldn't look nice at all for you.

1066
01:20:36,828 --> 01:20:39,729
{\fs17}That's right! Better let him stay where he is.

1067
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:43,633
{\fs17}You won't have to wait seven years to presume death, anyway.

1068
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:45,637
{\fs17}Seven years! I'll be an old man.

1069
01:20:45,671 --> 01:20:48,731
{\fs17}Don't be silly. You waited far longer than seven years already.

1070
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,139
{\fs17}Yes, but now I know what I'm waiting for.

1071
01:20:52,244 --> 01:20:54,371
{\fs17}I insist that you dig the wretched man up.

1072
01:20:54,446 --> 01:20:57,074
{\fs17}I don't care a hoot what they say.

1073
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:00,312
{\fs17}They'd only have to know me to realize the man must have been mad.

1074
01:21:00,385 --> 01:21:04,788
{\fs17}I disagree! Huh! Really, Capt. Wiles.

1075
01:21:06,558 --> 01:21:08,651
{\fs17}Well...

1076
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,921
{\fs17}I'll dig him up.

1077
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:13,396
{\fs17}But we'd better get it done before Calvin Wiggs...

1078
01:21:13,465 --> 01:21:16,127
{\fs17}gets the state police snooping around here.

1079
01:21:22,975 --> 01:21:25,705
{\fs17}[Jennifer] I've been thinking.

1080
01:21:25,777 --> 01:21:29,941
{\fs17}I've been thinking maybe we could forget the way it really happened.

1081
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,984
{\fs17}I could tell how Harry visited me and went off in such a rage today,

1082
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:36,579
{\fs17}and that's all we'd need to know about his being there.

1083
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:38,713
{\fs17}No, somebody else might get the blame.

1084
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:42,851
{\fs17}And somebody else might not have such a good reason as I did.

1085
01:21:42,928 --> 01:21:46,295
{\fs17}What do you mean "somebody else"?

1086
01:21:46,398 --> 01:21:50,334
{\fs17}I can think of at least two people with a good reason for having killed Harry.

1087
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:54,566
{\fs17}First you, because you married him. And now Sam.

1088
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,006
{\fs17}Me? Why would I want to kill him? I never met him before.

1089
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,578
{\fs17}You could still have a reason for killing him.

1090
01:22:00,645 --> 01:22:02,772
{\fs17}She means me. Yes.

1091
01:22:02,848 --> 01:22:06,340
{\fs17}I didn't fall in love with Jennifer until after Harry was dead.

1092
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:08,477
{\fs17}Try telling that to the police.

1093
01:22:08,553 --> 01:22:11,818
{\fs17}She's right, Sammy boy.

1094
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:16,451
{\fs17}Well, on second thought, we'd better stick to the truth, what there is of it.

1095
01:22:22,768 --> 01:22:26,898
{\fs17}We'll have to think up a reason why the police weren't informed before now.

1096
01:22:26,972 --> 01:22:30,430
{\fs17}Yes, then there's the condition he's in. That'll take some explaining.

1097
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:33,136
{\fs17}We'll just clean him up a bit.

1098
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:36,043
{\fs17}It's horrible, but there's nothing else we can do.

1099
01:22:36,148 --> 01:22:38,708
{\fs17}We can't risk complicating Miss Gravely's confession.

1100
01:22:38,784 --> 01:22:41,617
{\fs17}And as for the delay, I can explain that I was so upset...

1101
01:22:41,686 --> 01:22:45,281
{\fs17}by the occurrence that... I went straight home and rested.

1102
01:22:45,357 --> 01:22:49,020
{\fs17}Only natural. They'll think you rested rather a long time.

1103
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:52,188
{\fs17}Sam, I'd rather not spend the whole night debating.

1104
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:54,596
{\fs17}Let's get Harry someplace and clean him up.

1105
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:59,069
{\fs17}[Man Talking ] [Captain ] Let's get out of here.

1106
01:23:09,915 --> 01:23:13,476
{\fs17}Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks.

1107
01:23:13,585 --> 01:23:16,418
{\fs17}Bears it out even to the edge of doom.

1108
01:23:16,488 --> 01:23:20,390
{\fs17}If this be error and upon me proved,

1109
01:23:20,492 --> 01:23:24,588
{\fs17}I never writ, nor man ever loved.

1110
01:23:34,306 --> 01:23:38,606
{\fs17}I, uh, I think he met with a bit of an accident, Dr. Greenbow.

1111
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:40,611
{\fs17}He certainly did.

1112
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:44,248
{\fs17}Which of you found him?

1113
01:23:44,316 --> 01:23:47,308
{\fs17}Well... He was my husband, Doctor.

1114
01:23:47,352 --> 01:23:51,015
{\fs17}Oh, Mrs. Rogers. I didn't know you had a husband.

1115
01:23:51,123 --> 01:23:53,387
{\fs17}I'm awfully sorry.

1116
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:56,621
{\fs17}It's all right, Doctor. It's just life, I guess.

1117
01:23:56,728 --> 01:23:59,288
{\fs17}What happened to him? Well, he...

1118
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:04,233
{\fs17}That's what we'd like to know. Could you tell us what caused his death? It was so sudden.

1119
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:06,827
{\fs17}In this light, my opinion would be little more than a guess.

1120
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:09,771
{\fs17}In that case, we could take him someplace where you could see better.

1121
01:24:09,841 --> 01:24:13,436
{\fs17}All right, but I need my bag. Where shall we meet?

1122
01:24:13,545 --> 01:24:15,945
{\fs17}I'll take Harry home to my house.

1123
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:22,809
{\fs17}Going home for the last time.

1124
01:24:27,492 --> 01:24:29,722
{\fs17}Better be the last time.

1125
01:24:29,794 --> 01:24:33,252
{\fs17}Come on, Sam. I've got about one more trip left in me.

1126
01:24:33,298 --> 01:24:35,493
{\fs17}I'll get your coats.

1127
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:32,223
{\fs17}I'll get the suspenders on.

1128
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:42,632
{\fs17}I can't wait for this to be ready. I'll have to iron it dry.

1129
01:25:44,469 --> 01:25:46,437
{\fs17}Isn't it odd?

1130
01:25:46,471 --> 01:25:51,204
{\fs17}After refusing for so long, here I am finally doing Harry's laundry.

1131
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:12,191
{\fs17}Ah!

1132
01:26:12,264 --> 01:26:14,323
{\fs17}[Whispers] Look.

1133
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:16,993
{\fs17}It's nothing to get excited about, Captain.

1134
01:26:17,068 --> 01:26:20,060
{\fs17}It's only a closet door.

1135
01:26:20,105 --> 01:26:22,801
{\fs17}Oh. I thought it was Harry.

1136
01:26:22,874 --> 01:26:25,604
{\fs17}Relax, Captain. Nothing to worry about.

1137
01:26:31,383 --> 01:26:34,648
{\fs17}What about the cut I made on his head with my hiking shoe?

1138
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:37,813
{\fs17}[Jennifer] Hmm. I'll put some adhesive tape on it.

1139
01:26:37,889 --> 01:26:39,880
{\fs17}They'll think it was done before he died.

1140
01:26:39,991 --> 01:26:42,892
{\fs17}After the shirt's finished, it should be just about everything.

1141
01:26:44,996 --> 01:26:47,760
{\fs17}If that who I think it is... Calvin Wiggs' car.

1142
01:27:11,256 --> 01:27:13,417
{\fs17}[Jennifer ] Just one second.

1143
01:27:23,134 --> 01:27:25,864
{\fs17}Well, Calvin Wiggs. What a surprise.

1144
01:27:25,937 --> 01:27:28,838
{\fs17}Sam here? Yes, yes, yes, he's here.

1145
01:27:28,873 --> 01:27:31,865
{\fs17}Can I see him a minute?

1146
01:27:31,943 --> 01:27:33,877
{\fs17}Sam! Yeah?

1147
01:27:33,945 --> 01:27:36,277
{\fs17}Calvin Wiggs is here to see you.

1148
01:27:36,348 --> 01:27:38,282
{\fs17}Tell him I'll be right out.

1149
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:41,842
{\fs17}He says he'll be right out. Why don't I just go on in?

1150
01:27:47,492 --> 01:27:49,460
{\fs17}Evening, Calvin.

1151
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:52,962
{\fs17}Evening, Capt. Wiles. Miss Gravely.

1152
01:27:52,997 --> 01:27:55,124
{\fs17}We've got 'em on the run in four spades.

1153
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,363
{\fs17}[Chuckling] They should have been in diamonds.

1154
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:01,303
{\fs17}Play much bridge? Never play it.

1155
01:28:01,373 --> 01:28:05,275
{\fs17}- That's what I thought. - Something you wanted, Calvin?

1156
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:08,710
{\fs17}- Where were you today, Sam? - Working, as usual.

1157
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:12,944
{\fs17}Somewheres down by Mansfield Meadows?

1158
01:28:13,017 --> 01:28:15,349
{\fs17}Possibly. I do quite a bit of sketching around. Why?

1159
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:21,290
{\fs17}Is that where, uh...

1160
01:28:23,228 --> 01:28:25,696
{\fs17}Where you painted this?

1161
01:28:28,032 --> 01:28:30,398
{\fs17}I left that portrait with your mother.

1162
01:28:30,502 --> 01:28:32,902
{\fs17}What right do you have to carry it around with you? It might be damaged.

1163
01:28:33,004 --> 01:28:36,997
{\fs17}Huh. It could be priceless, and Sam would lose a sale.

1164
01:28:37,108 --> 01:28:40,737
{\fs17}Oh, I'll send him a box of blueberries the first of every month.

1165
01:28:40,812 --> 01:28:43,838
{\fs17}Sam, what I wanna know is where'd you paint it and who is it?

1166
01:28:43,915 --> 01:28:47,316
{\fs17}First of all, it's not a painting. It's a drawing.

1167
01:28:47,352 --> 01:28:49,650
{\fs17}Matter of fact, it's a pastel and...

1168
01:28:49,721 --> 01:28:53,623
{\fs17}as for the model, just came to me out of the blue.

1169
01:28:53,725 --> 01:28:57,752
{\fs17}- You don't say. - Why are you acting like a deputy sheriff?

1170
01:28:57,829 --> 01:29:00,593
{\fs17}That tramp I picked up, the one with the stolen shoes?

1171
01:29:00,665 --> 01:29:03,395
{\fs17}Said he got 'em off a dead man?

1172
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:07,461
{\fs17}He described him very carefully. The description fits this picture to a "T. ''

1173
01:29:07,539 --> 01:29:11,475
{\fs17}A tramp who probably can't keep his job and drinks too much...

1174
01:29:11,543 --> 01:29:14,034
{\fs17}I wouldn't think his word was very reliable.

1175
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:17,444
{\fs17}Got him locked up in the schoolhouse.

1176
01:29:17,549 --> 01:29:20,017
{\fs17}I took this painting down to show him... Drawing, if you don't mind.

1177
01:29:20,084 --> 01:29:23,053
{\fs17}I took the drawing down to show him. He almost fainted.

1178
01:29:23,087 --> 01:29:26,215
{\fs17}Said it was the same face. Where'd you paint it, Sam?

1179
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:31,257
{\fs17}From my vast subconscious.

1180
01:29:31,362 --> 01:29:35,264
{\fs17}Sam, I hate to say this, but I don't believe you.

1181
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,268
{\fs17}With all this talk, I've lost interest in the game.

1182
01:29:37,302 --> 01:29:39,862
{\fs17}If you'll forgive me, I'll just run along home.

1183
01:29:39,971 --> 01:29:43,202
{\fs17}I'll see you all tOmOrrOw.

1184
01:29:45,176 --> 01:29:47,576
{\fs17}What do you mean, you don't believe me?

1185
01:29:47,612 --> 01:29:52,777
{\fs17}What I mean, Sam... I ain't educated in fancy art,

1186
01:29:52,884 --> 01:29:56,684
{\fs17}but I do know the face of a dead man when I see one, and this is it.

1187
01:29:56,721 --> 01:30:00,589
{\fs17}Calvin Perhaps I can teach you Abstract art

1188
01:30:01,726 --> 01:30:05,355
{\fs17}See this? Portrait of a sleeping face.

1189
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:10,299
{\fs17}A man, relaxed, far removed from earthly cares.

1190
01:30:10,335 --> 01:30:14,499
{\fs17}It was conceived out of memory and half-forgotten impulse,

1191
01:30:14,606 --> 01:30:17,074
{\fs17}and it emerged from the shadows of abstract emotions,

1192
01:30:17,141 --> 01:30:22,306
{\fs17}until it was born full-grown from the mechanical reality of my fingertips.

1193
01:30:22,413 --> 01:30:25,109
{\fs17}Oh, now Sam, don't... I don't have to have a model to draw from.

1194
01:30:25,216 --> 01:30:27,878
{\fs17}Instead of creating a sleeping face, I could have, um,

1195
01:30:27,952 --> 01:30:31,285
{\fs17}chosen an entirely different set of artistic stimuli.

1196
01:30:31,356 --> 01:30:35,588
{\fs17}My subconscious is peopled with enough faces to cover the earth.

1197
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:40,120
{\fs17}And the construction of the human anatomy alone is so infinitely variable...

1198
01:30:40,164 --> 01:30:43,133
{\fs17}as to lie beyond the wildest powers of calculation.

1199
01:30:43,234 --> 01:30:47,330
{\fs17}Now, a raised eyelid, perhaps.

1200
01:30:50,441 --> 01:30:53,899
{\fs17}A line of fullness to the cheek.

1201
01:30:53,978 --> 01:30:56,674
{\fs17}Lip that bends with expression.

1202
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:00,484
{\fs17}There.

1203
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:04,916
{\fs17}Sam, do you... Do you know what you just did?

1204
01:31:04,989 --> 01:31:09,187
{\fs17}Certainly. Just showed you how clearly you misinterpreted my art.

1205
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,457
{\fs17}You just destroyed legal evidence.

1206
01:31:13,765 --> 01:31:17,599
{\fs17}Calvin, it appears to me you still don't understand.

1207
01:31:17,669 --> 01:31:20,661
{\fs17}I understand you made kind of a fool out of me.

1208
01:31:20,705 --> 01:31:24,038
{\fs17}But I still got enough evidence to know something funny's goin' on around here.

1209
01:31:24,108 --> 01:31:27,009
{\fs17}I ain't goin' to sleep till I find out what it is.

1210
01:31:29,881 --> 01:31:32,475
{\fs17}[Jennifer ] Good night, Calvin.

1211
01:31:36,321 --> 01:31:38,983
{\fs17}Hey! What's he doin' in our bathtub?

1212
01:31:42,026 --> 01:31:45,120
{\fs17}- That's where frogs belong. - [ Arnie ] Oh.

1213
01:31:45,196 --> 01:31:48,962
{\fs17}- Back to bed, Arnie - State troopers'll be up in the mornin'.

1214
01:31:49,033 --> 01:31:52,298
{\fs17}I'm gonna want 'em to have a talk with you, so be around.

1215
01:31:52,403 --> 01:31:55,395
{\fs17}- [Whispering] I said back to bed. - You can find me at my studio.

1216
01:31:55,506 --> 01:31:59,567
{\fs17}Just make sure... [Knocking At Door ]

1217
01:32:02,747 --> 01:32:04,715
{\fs17}Where is he?

1218
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:08,912
{\fs17}He-He's in the bathroom playing with his frog.

1219
01:32:11,556 --> 01:32:15,515
{\fs17}- Oh? - I'm... This way, please, Doctor.

1220
01:32:17,328 --> 01:32:19,489
{\fs17}It's Arnie. He's not very well.

1221
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:25,226
{\fs17}Someone must be foolin' around with my car.

1222
01:32:36,481 --> 01:32:40,042
{\fs17}What are you playin' with the horn for? It ain't your car.

1223
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:42,949
{\fs17}Well, things are funny, you know?

1224
01:32:43,054 --> 01:32:46,353
{\fs17}Me and Miss Gravely might be in the car market. We're looking for a car.

1225
01:32:46,457 --> 01:32:49,620
{\fs17}Yes. Had a look at this one. It's a beauty.

1226
01:32:49,694 --> 01:32:51,685
{\fs17}I want to keep it that way.

1227
01:32:51,763 --> 01:32:55,028
{\fs17}Now, now, that's not the way to talk to a prospective customer.

1228
01:32:55,099 --> 01:32:58,432
{\fs17}You're no prospective customer. You can't afford this car.

1229
01:33:10,982 --> 01:33:12,882
{\fs17}He's gone.

1230
01:33:12,984 --> 01:33:16,613
{\fs17}I put the little... I put Arnie back to bed.

1231
01:33:16,688 --> 01:33:19,589
{\fs17}What'd the doctor say? He said for me to get out.

1232
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:23,684
{\fs17}I didn't like the look in his eye, either. Something seems to be bothering him.

1233
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:29,961
{\fs17}Well, Captain. Did you get over being frightened?

1234
01:33:31,102 --> 01:33:33,627
{\fs17}Frightened? [Laughing]

1235
01:33:33,705 --> 01:33:36,367
{\fs17}Oh, no. That's not why I left.

1236
01:33:36,441 --> 01:33:39,968
{\fs17}No. I'm not easily frightened, you know. No.

1237
01:33:40,044 --> 01:33:44,003
{\fs17}Why, after all those years sailing the four corners of the globe,

1238
01:33:44,048 --> 01:33:47,540
{\fs17}strange ports, a lot of rough men and...

1239
01:33:50,254 --> 01:33:54,350
{\fs17}Miss Gravely, what would you say...

1240
01:33:54,425 --> 01:33:56,484
{\fs17}if I told you...

1241
01:33:56,561 --> 01:33:59,553
{\fs17}I was only the captain of a tugboat...

1242
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,564
{\fs17}on the East River...

1243
01:34:01,632 --> 01:34:05,193
{\fs17}and never got more than a mile or so off shore?

1244
01:34:11,843 --> 01:34:14,505
{\fs17}Well, I would say that,

1245
01:34:14,579 --> 01:34:17,343
{\fs17}that you were the handsomest tugboat captain...

1246
01:34:17,448 --> 01:34:19,643
{\fs17}that ever sailed up the East River.

1247
01:34:21,552 --> 01:34:24,146
{\fs17}[Chuckling] Oh, maybe not. No.

1248
01:34:24,255 --> 01:34:27,383
{\fs17}You want to see something? Here.

1249
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:31,560
{\fs17}Captain. Where'd you get those?

1250
01:34:31,662 --> 01:34:34,893
{\fs17}Calvin Wiggs' car.

1251
01:34:34,966 --> 01:34:36,900
{\fs17}I figured you were handling half the evidence, Sammy,

1252
01:34:36,968 --> 01:34:39,163
{\fs17}so it was up to me to take care of the rest.

1253
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:42,364
{\fs17}You're the sweetest, old tugboat captain I ever kissed.

1254
01:34:42,707 --> 01:34:45,403
{\fs17}What's he doing in the bathtub?

1255
01:34:45,476 --> 01:34:48,274
{\fs17}Well, uh... What'd you find out, Doctor?

1256
01:34:48,379 --> 01:34:52,713
{\fs17}Oh, that. It was his heart. He had a seizure.

1257
01:34:52,784 --> 01:34:55,514
{\fs17}His heart? Yes, but...

1258
01:34:55,586 --> 01:34:58,680
{\fs17}A seizure! Well, I'll take a trip to the Philippines.

1259
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:01,759
{\fs17}Death from natural causes. Well, certainly.

1260
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:05,956
{\fs17}But will somebody tell me what he's doin' in the bathtub half undressed?

1261
01:35:07,899 --> 01:35:10,834
{\fs17}Frankly, we didn't want Calvin Wiggs to see him.

1262
01:35:12,937 --> 01:35:15,428
{\fs17}Besides, he was awful dirty after we dug him up.

1263
01:35:15,506 --> 01:35:17,906
{\fs17}"Dug him up"?

1264
01:35:18,009 --> 01:35:20,705
{\fs17}I'd better explain, Doctor. You see,

1265
01:35:20,812 --> 01:35:23,781
{\fs17}Harry's been buried and dug up on and off all day long.

1266
01:35:23,848 --> 01:35:25,816
{\fs17}What?

1267
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:28,114
{\fs17}Finally, he caused so many complications that...

1268
01:35:28,219 --> 01:35:31,518
{\fs17}we decided to clean him up and put him back where we found him.

1269
01:35:31,622 --> 01:35:34,113
{\fs17}I don't understand you. What complications?

1270
01:35:34,225 --> 01:35:36,750
{\fs17}Well, for example,

1271
01:35:36,828 --> 01:35:40,229
{\fs17}he upset Capt. Wiles because the captain thought he had shot him.

1272
01:35:40,331 --> 01:35:44,028
{\fs17}The hole in the head, you know. But as it turned out, it wasn't the captain.

1273
01:35:44,135 --> 01:35:47,332
{\fs17}It was the blow he got from the heel of Miss Gravely's shoe after he attacked her.

1274
01:35:47,438 --> 01:35:50,134
{\fs17}Capt. Wiles attacked Miss Gravely?

1275
01:35:50,241 --> 01:35:53,074
{\fs17}Oh, no, Doctor. Harry.

1276
01:35:53,144 --> 01:35:55,738
{\fs17}He dragged her into the bushes, thinking it was me.

1277
01:35:55,847 --> 01:36:00,045
{\fs17}He was dazed, I supposed, after I hit him on the head with a milk bottle.

1278
01:36:04,088 --> 01:36:06,921
{\fs17}The captain and Sam buried him first.

1279
01:36:06,991 --> 01:36:09,653
{\fs17}[Giggles] The captain was so scared.

1280
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,163
{\fs17}Then he accounted for all his bullets, so up Harry came.

1281
01:36:14,198 --> 01:36:16,758
{\fs17}Then Miss Gravely thought her shoe was responsible for it so...

1282
01:36:16,868 --> 01:36:21,032
{\fs17}- Shoe? - So the captain... rather gallantly, I thought...

1283
01:36:21,105 --> 01:36:23,073
{\fs17}pushed him back in again.

1284
01:36:23,107 --> 01:36:26,338
{\fs17}Then he was out and back... I can't remember why.

1285
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:29,470
{\fs17}But anyway, he's out again now because Sam and I wanna get married.

1286
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:32,674
{\fs17}Yeah. But why did you...

1287
01:36:32,783 --> 01:36:34,683
{\fs17}Hit him on the head?

1288
01:36:34,785 --> 01:36:38,084
{\fs17}That wouldn't interest you. It's purely personal and nonmedical.

1289
01:36:38,189 --> 01:36:41,750
{\fs17}Besides, it's awfully late, so if you'll just keep quiet about all this,

1290
01:36:41,826 --> 01:36:44,090
{\fs17}we'll put Harry back in the morning, nice and clean,

1291
01:36:44,195 --> 01:36:46,095
{\fs17}and no one will be any the wiser.

1292
01:36:46,197 --> 01:36:48,688
{\fs17}And then we'll be rid of all these sticky complications.

1293
01:36:48,799 --> 01:36:51,063
{\fs17}Put him back. Put him back, that's all. Just put him back.

1294
01:36:51,135 --> 01:36:54,434
{\fs17}This is the first nightmare I've had in 25 years.

1295
01:36:58,442 --> 01:37:00,307
{\fs17}He's kinda strange, isn't he?

1296
01:37:06,617 --> 01:37:10,713
{\fs17}[Chuckling] Well, um, hadn't we better get Harry dressed?

1297
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:12,755
{\fs17}[Sam] Yes, yes.

1298
01:37:19,363 --> 01:37:22,423
{\fs17}Wouldn't it be nice if Arnie found him all over again?

1299
01:37:22,533 --> 01:37:25,468
{\fs17}Then he'd run home and tell me, and then I'd phone Calvin Wiggs.

1300
01:37:25,536 --> 01:37:28,699
{\fs17}Yes! Arnie could explain quite clearly to Calvin...

1301
01:37:28,773 --> 01:37:32,675
{\fs17}That he found Harry tomorrow. You mean today.

1302
01:37:32,743 --> 01:37:35,143
{\fs17}But to Arnie, tomorrow is yesterday.

1303
01:37:37,048 --> 01:37:39,039
{\fs17}Let's go get Harry. Come on, Captain.

1304
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,564
{\fs17}Here he comes.

1305
01:38:15,219 --> 01:38:17,187
{\fs17}Go on, Arnie. Run home and tell me about it.

1306
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:19,189
{\fs17}Don't touch him.

1307
01:38:19,223 --> 01:38:21,714
{\fs17}Please, Arnie, run home and tell your mother.

1308
01:38:21,792 --> 01:38:23,885
{\fs17}Beat it, you little creep.

1309
01:38:23,995 --> 01:38:27,590
{\fs17}I mean, hurry home, son.

1310
01:38:36,741 --> 01:38:39,232
{\fs17}Captain, you never told me your first name.

1311
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:41,244
{\fs17}Albert. What's yours?

1312
01:38:41,312 --> 01:38:45,510
{\fs17}Iv
