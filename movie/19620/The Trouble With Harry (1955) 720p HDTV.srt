1
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,935
OK! I know how to handle your type.

2
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,337
Well, old faithful,
that's your shooting for the day.

3
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,970
If we haven't rung up
at least two rabbits,

4
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,734
we deserve to go home empty-handed.

5
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,813
Yeah, still, blessed are they
who expect nothing.

6
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,016
For they shall not be disappointed.

7
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,698
Mm. Fewer things in life give a man
more pleasure than hunting.

8
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,249
It satisfies his primitive nature,

9
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,174
striding through the woods,
picking up his kill.

10
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,615
Well, come on, old faithful.

11
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,614
There's plump rabbits
waiting for the frying pan.

12
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,137
If this can had four legs and a tail,
we'd be eating it tonight.

13
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,810
Clean through the heart.

14
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,016
For rice cake! I've done him in.

15
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,171
Cor.

16
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,971
A harmless pot-shot at a rabbit
and I'm a murderer, a killer.

17
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,813
Mother always said
I'd come to a bad end.

18
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,540
What in Hades were you doing here
anyway?

19
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,499
I can't say that I've seen you
around here before.

20
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,529
No. If you're going to get yourself
shot, do it where you're known.

21
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,416
"Mr Harry Worp,

22
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,698
87 Maple Avenue,
Boston, Massachusetts. "

23
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,409
Worp, you're a long way from home.

24
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,333
With the looks of it, you won't
get back for Christmas, now.

25
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,176
We're going to have a cold,
hard winter.

26
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,810
Mm. You might keep here a long time,
an awful long time.

27
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,971
Too long for me, Harry.

28
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,017
Yes.

29
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,617
Captain Wiles?

30
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,617
Yes, ma'am?

31
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,051
What seems to be the trouble,
Captain?

32
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,691
It's what you might call
an unavoidable accident.

33
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,170
- He's dead.
- Yes.

34
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,497
I would say that he was. Of course,
that's an unprofessional opinion.

35
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,970
Yeah. Did you...
did you know him, Miss Gravely?

36
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,053
- No. Doesn't live around here.
- Well, he died around here.

37
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,132
- That's what counts now.
- Embarrassing.

38
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,849
What do you plan to do with him,
Captain?

39
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,810
Miss Gravely, without cutting the hem
off truth's garment,

40
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,972
I'm gonna hide him, cover him up,

41
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,131
forget him.

42
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,738
Are you never going to inform
the police, Captain?

43
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,210
No. Forget you saw me, Miss Gravely.

44
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,417
Chase it out of your mind, for
heaven's sake, it was an accident.

45
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,414
He was poking around the clearing
and I thought he was a rabbit.

46
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,209
It was a human error.
Ah, now, please, don't...

47
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,577
Don't say anything to anybody,
Miss Gravely.

48
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,410
Do as you think best, Captain.

49
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,572
I'm sure you must have met
many similar situations

50
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,776
in your travels in foreign lands.

51
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,216
- Yeah, I've seen much worse things.
- I certainly won't say anything.

52
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,769
Much worse things.
I remember when I was on the Orinoco.

53
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,137
We had a Turk, a great, big Turk,
running amuck with a machete -

54
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,815
Captain, if I were going to hide
an accident, I shouldn't delay.

55
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,973
Oh. Oh.
You're right as rain, Miss Gravely.

56
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,928
Yes. You know something?
I'm glad I met you today.

57
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,853
I feel better for telling someone
as warm,

58
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,849
tender, understanding as yourself.

59
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,013
Well, on the contrary, Captain. It...

60
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,216
It...

61
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,178
I'm certainly glad
if I helped you, Captain.

62
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,491
Perhaps you would care to come over
for some blueberry muffins

63
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,333
and coffee later on,
high-bush blueberries?

64
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,253
Ah, well. This is certainly something
of an interesting surprise.

65
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,980
- And maybe some elderberry wine.
- Oh!

66
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,810
After all, we've been neighbours
for nearly three years now and...

67
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,971
we've never exchanged social calls.

68
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,893
You're right.
It's high time I paid a call.

69
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,530
- What time?
- Oh, say, early this afternoon.

70
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,375
I'll be there with a clean shirt
and a hungry face.

71
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,655
Do that.

72
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,457
You better be going now. Don't want
to be an accessory after the fact.

73
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,250
You are a considerate man,
Captain Wiles.

74
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,895
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

75
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,929
We're almost there, Mommy!

76
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,291
Here he is, Mommy. Here he is.

77
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,934
- What did I tell ya, Mommy?
- Don't touch it, Arnie.

78
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,696
- There he is.
- No. It can't be! Harry!

79
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,294
Harry, thank Providence,
the last of Harry.

80
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,770
- Who's Providence, Mommy?
- A very good friend.

81
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,090
- Don't you know who it is?
- You said Harry.

82
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,650
- Can't you remember, Arnie?
- Why don't he get up and move?

83
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,811
He's asleep.

84
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,370
He's in a deep sleep,
a deep, wonderful sleep.

85
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,531
How'd he hurt his head?

86
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,691
Putting it where it wasn't wanted,
would be my guess.

87
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,658
- Will it get better?
- Not if we're lucky.

88
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,771
Let's run home
and I'll make you some lemonade.

89
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,977
Will lemonade put me in a wonderful,
deep, deep sleep, Mommy?

90
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,131
No, Arnie, but it's better
than no lemonade.

91
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,895
- I don't understand that.
- Never mind. Forget you saw him.

92
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,972
- Is there a special way to forget?
- Just think of something else.

93
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,689
- I'll try not to see him tomorrow.
- That's a good boy, Arnie.

94
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,658
Now, let's run home
and get that lemonade.

95
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,859
She won't care what I do with him.

96
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,575
Couldn't have had more people here
if I'd sold tickets.

97
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,940
What's the big attraction, I wonder?

98
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,218
This could turn out to be
the luckiest day of my life.

99
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,734
I'll just wait till the whole world
comes to pay their last respects.

100
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,017
Sooner or later one of them has
to turn out to be the Deputy Sheriff.

101
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,609
# Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa

102
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,089
# Flaggin' the train that's going home

103
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,694
# Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa

104
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,809
# Never no more, no more to roam

105
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,175
# Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa

106
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,854

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,295

108
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,329
# Back to the gal I left behind

109
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,934
# Got no baggage

110
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,170

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,331

114
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,570

115
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,018
# Flaggin' the train

116
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,971

# Is waitin' for me there #

124
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,451
Hello, Mr Marlowe.

125
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,171
Wiggy, you haven't sold a painting.
All my pictures in the same place.

126
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,538
So few cars. They don't... I guess
the cider takes their attention.

127
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,373
Cider, indeed.
Throw it away! Drink it.

128
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,532
- No, I hate cider.
- Not a picture sold.

129
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,897
I'm sorry, Mr Marlowe. Let's get
a look at your new one. Hold it up.

130
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,895
What good would it do? You don't
deserve to see it. How will I eat?

131
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,098
Mr Wiggs always used to thump
his stomach when he got mad.

132
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,251
He busted somethin' inside once.

133
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,775
You think we'd do any better
on 5th Avenue?

134
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,931
If there's more people there.

135
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,251
Oh, lots of people. Hundreds
and thousands and billions of people.

136
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,980
- It might be better then.
- But what sort of people, Wiggy?

137
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,131
What breed? I'll tell you.

138
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,657
They're little people,
little people with hats on.

139
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,811
How are your cigarettes?

140
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,251
I'll buy the other half tomorrow.

141
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,532
What does your son do with all those
old cars he always works on?

142
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,897
He sells 'em. Mechanical antiques.
Doesn't make much, needs the money.

143
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,139
Hm. Doesn't he get paid
for being deputy sheriff?

144
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,417
Piecework.
Gets paid by the arrest, I think.

145
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,892
Ah, Mr Marlowe, it's wonderful.

146
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,212
- I've been in a tortured mood.
- What is it?

147
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,689
Good old Wiggy, my sternest critic.

148
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,092
I don't understand it but I think
it's beautiful. Mrs Rogers agrees.

149
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,376
- Oh? You talk about me?
- Well, I...

150
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,576
She's the pretty woman
with the little boy, isn't she?

151
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,856
Mm-hm.
I only brought up your name once

152
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,136
when we were talking
about strange people.

153
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,609
- Huh?
- That is, strangers.

154
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,896
- Oh.
- People she hadn't met yet.

155
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,528
What does the pretty,
little thing say about me?

156
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,691
Nothin'.

157
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,899
I think we better discuss business.
Here, my shopping list.

158
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,699
I'll go in and start puttin' it up.

159
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,533
Wiggy, how do you spell Tuscaloosa?

160
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,850
Sam?

161
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,575
- Hi, Calvin.
- You hear any shootin'?

162
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,617
- Nope.
- I did.

163
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,896
And there shouldn't be
any shootin' around here.

164
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,051
- Why?
- It's posted land, that's why.

165
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,338
- Why's that?
- 'Cause I posted it.

166
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,015
What's wrong with people doing
shooting now and then? Let off steam.

167
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,614
Bullets and guns are dangerous.
They kill things.

168
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,738
No one around here could hit
a freight car with a cannon.

169
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,056
I guess you're right, Sam.
All the same, the law's the law.

170
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,657
I got a mind to scout around to find
out who's shooting and level a fine.

171
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,209
And pick up a little piecework?

172
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,896
If I can do anything to make it
any harder for you, let me know.

173
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,457
How'd you want your bacon,
Mr Marlowe?

174
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,090
- What were you saying?
- I asked how you want your bacon.

175
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,058
Sliced.

176
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,937
- Where is Calvin?
- Off somewheres unimportant.

177
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,058
What a wonderful day.

178
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,814
So was yesterday, but you didn't say
anything to me about it.

179
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,096
What you want Calvin for?

180
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,820
These marvellous pictures.

181
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,255
Someone told me they were yours.

182
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,411
Why don't you sell them,
make a lot of money?

183
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,650
Never thought of it. I guess
I'll just have to think about it.

184
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,449
And that song. You sing it so
beautifully. You wrote it yourself?

185
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,611
What do you want to borrow?

186
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,295
I think people need encouragement
sometimes, don't you, Mr Marlowe?

187
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,452
- How'd you know my name?
- It's on the pictures, isn't it?

188
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,692
- It's not supposed to be readable.
- I can tell it's not supposed to be.

189
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,897
They're very professional,
don't you think, Mrs Wiggs?

190
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,655
Well, Miss Gravely,
all I know is nobody buys them.

191
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,571
Thank you for your encouragement,
Miss Gravely.

192
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,016
- Now I wonder how you know my name?
- Easy. Wiggy just said it.

193
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,411
Wiggy. What a perfectly ridiculous
little nickname.

194
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,696
Do you mind if I call you Wiggy,
Mrs Wiggs?

195
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,454
Not if you pay all your bills
on time.

196
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,896
Alright, Mr Marlowe,
Bacon, beans, cabbage,

197
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,575
sugar, salt, tea, oleomargarine.

198
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,618
- $1.95.
- And half a box of cigarettes.

199
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,977
- Ah, yes. Ten cents, two five.
- That much?

200
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,535
I don't seem to be able to find...

201
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,817
I know, Mr Marlowe, as soon as
we sell some of your paintings.

202
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,048
Let me make my position clear -

203
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,211
Shhh.

204
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,371
What do you think?

205
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,295
I think it'll hold coffee.

206
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,935
Will you try it, Mr Marlowe?

207
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,816
Put your finger through the handle,
please.

208
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,214
How about the size?
What about the handle?

209
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,177
Hm?

210
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,298
I mean, does it fit?
Is it the right finger size?

211
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,530
It's my finger size.

212
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,014
- I'll take it.
- Fifteen cents.

213
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,171
- And the saucer?
- Ten.

214
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,969
- That seems a fair price.
- What's important about finger size?

215
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,689
I wanted to be certain
it would fit a man.

216
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,249
- A certain size man.
- A man?

217
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,129
A certain somebody is coming over
to my cottage this afternoon.

218
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,337
- Not really?
- For coffee and blueberry muffins.

219
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,570
Why, you old social butterfly, you.

220
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,093
Old?

221
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,171
That was figuratively speaking.

222
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,773
I think we've got
a nearsighted cider customer.

223
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,249
How old do you think I am, young man?

224
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,811
Hmmm. Fifty.
How old do you think you are?

225
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,370
Forty-two. I can show you
my birth certificate.

226
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,579
You'll have to show more than your
birth certificate to convince a man.

227
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,334
- What do you mean?
- You have to show your character,

228
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,617
the inner self, the hidden qualities,

229
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,578
the true Miss Gravely,
sensitive, young in feeling,

230
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,413
timeless with love and understanding.

231
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,290
I can do it!
At least, I think I can do it.

232
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,575
Do what?

233
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,129
- I'll see what that gentleman -
- At a time like this?

234
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,416
- Where are your scissors?
- Outside.

235
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,571
We're going to cut her hair.

236
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,617
- Hair?
- Cut it short.

237
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,817
Bring it up-to-date,
make a nice romantic styling,

238
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,050
take ten years
off your birth certificate.

239
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,893
- How are you fixed for ribbon?
- Should be some around somewhere.

240
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,051
- Powder, rouge, lipstick?
- I think so.

241
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,814
Nothing cheap, shoddy or obvious.

242
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,892
Just youth, gentility, character.

243
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,769
I'll go out and get the scissors.
You find the other things.

244
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,412
- Ah, here they are.
- Excuse me, young man, I...

245
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,731
Oh, well.

246
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,889
All right, Ernest. Let's go.

247
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,217
Well, always grow back, I guess.

248
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,651
There's Calvin.

249
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,177
- Is he alone?
- Yep. Guess he didn't sell his car.

250
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,294
Hey! Would you mind
getting out of my picture?

251
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,658
Next thing you know, they'll be
televising the whole thing.

252
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,297
Huh.

253
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,460
- This your body, little man?
- Don't turn me in.

254
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,088
It was an accident,
an accident, pure and simple.

255
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,251
I thought he was a rabbit
or a pheasant or something.

256
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,378
- It could've happened to you.
- Suppose we straighten this out?

257
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,610
I guess that's the only way out.

258
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,089
First thing I seen
when I rolled out this morning

259
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,694
was a double-breasted robin
drunk as a hoot owl,

260
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,976
from eating fermented chokecherries.

261
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,131
Right away I knew somebody
was in trouble.

262
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,133
What I didn't know
was that it was me.

263
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,690
The larder was empty and I got to
thinking about a toothful...

264
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,812
Stands to reason
that they can't touch you for it.

265
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,330
Nothing these days
stands to reason.

266
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,537
It was accidental,
an act of God, perhaps.

267
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,408
In a way you should be grateful
that you were able to do your share

268
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,697
in accomplishing
the destiny of a fellow being.

269
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,295
Suppose, for instance,
it was written in the book of heaven,

270
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,451
that this man was to die

271
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,532
at this particular time,
at this particular place.

272
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,770
And suppose for a moment
that the actual

273
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,092
accomplishing of his departure had
been bungled, something gone wrong.

274
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,172
Uh... Perhaps it was meant to be
a thunderbolt

275
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,456
and there was
no thunder available, say.

276
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,088
Well, then you come along,
and you shoot him...

277
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,050
and heaven's will is done
and destiny fulfilled.

278
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,053
Your conscience is quite clear.
You've got nothing to worry about.

279
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,370
Sammy, I haven't got a conscience.

280
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,531
And it's not heaven
that's worrying me

281
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,691
because I don't expect
I'll ever have to face it.

282
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,090
And it's none of those noble things
you were talking about, no.

283
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,209
- Nothing like that.
- Then what is it?

284
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,213
It's me. It's me that's worrying me,

285
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,098
me and my future life.

286
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,296
I know the police
and their suspicious ways.

287
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,496
You're guilty until
you're proved innocent.

288
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,096
I want nothing more to do with him.
Bury him, and be done with him.

289
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,410
He's no good to anyone now.

290
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,539
Lay him to rest.
Put him under the sod. Forget him.

291
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,009
I never did it and you never saw him.

292
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,330
Yes, what about all those
other people who saw him?

293
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,890
How about the woman and the boy,
Miss Gravely and the tramp and...

294
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,051
the man who was reading the book,
Dr Greenbow?

295
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,293
- How about all of them?
- Nobody was interested, I tell you.

296
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,735
Nobody ever cared
until you came along.

297
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,777
Ah, that's what you think.

298
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,090
Suppose someone starts to care
after you've buried him?

299
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,252
I can't wait for people to start
caring whenever they feel like it.

300
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,570
I don't want a little accident
to turn into a career.

301
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,250
Suppose that woman
who called him Harry...

302
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,536
Suppose she decides
she loves him after all.

303
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,818
- She was hysterical with delight.
- Hm? What was she like?

304
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,972
Pretty as a rainbow.
Wish I was two years younger.

305
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,132
- And with a little boy?
- Yeah, about four or five years old.

306
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,019
Hmm. It's got to be Mrs Rogers
and her son.

307
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,618
Why don't we slip him underground
now that you've finished drawing him?

308
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,089
We could discuss
the smaller details later.

309
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,098
I don't like it. The authorities
like to know when people die.

310
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,615
All right, Sammy.

311
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,852
Forget it. You cut off home.

312
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,250
I killed him
and I'll look after his remains.

313
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,890
What'll you do, drag him around the
countryside the rest of the day?

314
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,858
I'll do my best.
That's all a man can do.

315
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,659
If you're not careful, you will get
a murder charge lined up.

316
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,129
Matter of fact, I'm beginning
to suspect something myself.

317
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,097
There you are then. See?

318
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,094
If you, an artist, suspect the worst,
what will they, the police, think?

319
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,535
What about that envelope
with his name and address on it?

320
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,975
By rights, you should
mail him back home.

321
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:38,612
Have you forgotten who carries the
mail down to the station every night?

322
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,419
Calvin Wiggs, deputy sheriff.

323
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,775
Oh, yes. You're right.

324
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,216
I'll tell you what we'll do.
I'll tell you what.

325
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,848
We'll find out how well
Mrs Rogers knows this man,

326
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,534
and whether she intends
to notify the police of his death.

327
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,215
- What good will that do?
- Why, a lot of good.

328
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,896
If she's a distant friend of his and
doesn't plan to notify the police,

329
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,779
then I, personally,
will help you bury Harry.

330
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,371
Oh, Sammy!
You've signed on for the cruise.

331
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,849
What time is it?

332
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,891
- About noon.
- Good heavens.

333
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,255
I've got to go home and spruce up.
I've got a date with Miss Gravely.

334
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,176
Not you. You are not the one.

335
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,938
Oh, Sam. She could do a lot worse,
you know?

336
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,935
Couldn't do any better. Just think,
you'd be establishing a precedent.

337
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,091
I'm not establishing nothing.

338
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:38,573
I am going over for blueberry muffins
and coffee by her own invitation.

339
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,459
And possibly some elderberry wine.

340
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,578
Do you realise that you'll be
the first man to...

341
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,731
cross her threshold?

342
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,133
Oh. Oh...
it's not too late, you know.

343
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,370
She's a well preserved woman.

344
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,691
- I envy you.
- Yes, very well preserved.

345
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,650
And preserves
have to be opened someday. Hm?

346
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,210
Yes. Now, you just trot down
and see what Mrs Rogers has to say.

347
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,497
- How about hiding Harry first?
- Holy smoke!

348
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,450
Forgetting a little detail
like that could hang a man. Yes.

349
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,138
Oh. Oh, I beg your pardon.

350
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,856
I hope I never have to be
operated on by Dr Greenbow.

351
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,011
- Come on. Let's get going.
- Yeah.

352
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,371
Good afternoon.

353
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,455
You're beautiful, wonderful.

354
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,975
You're the most wonderful,
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

355
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,131
I'd like to paint you.

356
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,418
Was there something else
you wanted, Mr... Marlowe, isn't it?

357
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,329
You certainly are a lovely woman.
I'd like to paint you nude.

358
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,254
Some other time, Mr Marlowe. I was
about to make Arnie some lemonade.

359
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,776
Oh, yes, of course. Perhaps I've come
at an awkward moment.

360
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,295
If you want to undress me, you have.

361
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,451
Well, it wasn't exactly that.

362
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,929
I came here to talk to you about
something, but after I saw you it...

363
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,897
slipped my mind.

364
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,370
- It couldn't have been important.
- I guess you're right.

365
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,579
Sit on the porch. I'll get you a
lemonade. Maybe you'll think of it.

366
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,174
You're not only beautiful,
you're considerate too.

367
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,136
- Arnie!
- Hello, Mr Marlowe!

368
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,291
Hi. What do you got, a rabbit?

369
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,137
Dead. What have you got?

370
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,690
Oh, I got me a little frog.

371
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,452
Whoop!

372
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,449
- There he is.
- It's hungry.

373
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,611
Whoop!

374
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,053
- I'll trade ya.
- Your mother for mine?

375
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,054
- The rabbit for the frog.
- It's yours, Arnie.

376
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,973
I think you got the best deal.
Dead rabbits don't eat.

377
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,133
I'll just take it in the kitchen
and give him some lemonade.

378
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,335
Four rabbit's feet,
and he got killed.

379
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,857
- Should've had a four-leaf clover.
- And a horseshoe.

380
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,329
Say, how do rabbits get to be born?

381
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,934
- Same way elephants do.
- Oh, sure.

382
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,568
How come you never came over
to visit me before?

383
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,731
Didn't know you had such
a pretty mother, Arnie.

384
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,654
If you think she's pretty,
you should see my slingshot.

385
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,652
- Perhaps I'll come back tomorrow.
- When's that?

386
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,335
- The day after today.
- That's yesterday. Today's tomorrow.

387
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,890
- It was.
- When was tomorrow yesterday?

388
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,654
- Today.
- Oh, sure, yesterday.

389
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,857
You'll never make sense
out of Arnie. He has his own timing.

390
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,896
Thank you.

391
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,699
- Lemonade, Arnie?
- I already swiped two glasses.

392
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,739
- I would've given you two glasses.
- It's more fun to swipe.

393
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,891
Can I borrow your rabbit, Mr Marlowe?

394
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,051
Sure, Arnie.
What are you gonna do with it?

395
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,054
You never know when a dead rabbit
might come in handy.

396
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,011
It already got me one frog.

397
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,414
Arnie! Where are you going now?

398
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,775
To make some more trades.

399
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,171
- Come home in time for supper.
- OK.

400
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,571
What's your given name? If you don't
want to tell me, just make one up.

401
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,738
Jennifer. Jennifer Rogers.

402
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,050
Nice.

403
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,371
Um, who's the man up on the path?

404
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,612
- What man?
- You know, Harry, the dead man.

405
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,331
Oh, him.

406
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,491
That's my husband.

407
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,049
Your husband's dead, then?

408
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,051
Is your lemonade sweet enough?

409
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,256
- It seems to be.
- I like it tart.

410
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,894
Harry is Arnie's father, then?

411
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,654
- No, Arnie's father's dead.
- So is Harry.

412
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,134
Thank goodness.
He was too good to live.

413
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,053
From his looks, he didn't appear to
me to be the kind who was too good.

414
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,529
Well, he was. Horribly good.

415
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,932
I like your mouth too,
especially when you say, "Good. "

416
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,450
- Will you have some more lemonade?
- Well, maybe later. Thanks.

417
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,929
Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?

418
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,175
He found it.
Maybe the Captain shot it.

419
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,049
I'd like to hear more
of your life story.

420
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,211
You see, we don't know
quite what to do with Harry.

421
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,692
- Thought you might have suggestions.
- You can stuff him for all I care.

422
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,531
Stuff him
and put him in a glass case.

423
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,498
Only I'd suggest frosted glass.

424
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,893
What did he do to you,
besides marry you?

425
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,219
Look, I've wanted to explain
about Harry a lot of times...

426
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,577
But nobody would understand,

427
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,254
least of all, Harry.

428
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,411
But you...

429
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,572
You've got an artistic mind.
You can see the finer things.

430
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,493
When I'm lucky.
Go on, tell me everything.

431
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,855
Let it all out.

432
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,089
It was a long time ago and I was
in love. I was too much in love.

433
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,854
- What was his name?
- Robert.

434
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,932
We'd agreed to overlook each other's
families and get married.

435
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,092
- Did you?
- Oh, yes.

436
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,939
- And then Robert got killed.
- Oh?

437
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,529
I was heartbroken for six weeks.

438
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,533
Then I discovered little Arnie
was on the way.

439
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,090
- Must have been a shock.
- Well, that's where Harry came in.

440
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,328
Harry the handsome hero.
Harry the saint.

441
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,298
- Harry the good.
- I didn't catch his last name.

442
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,974
Harry Worp, Robert's brother,
his older brother.

443
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,096
And he fell in love with you?

444
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,252
If he'd have fallen in love with me,
I wouldn't have minded.

445
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,492
He wanted to marry me because he was
Robert's brother and felt noble.

446
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,890
But you thought he was
in love with you?

447
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,855
And I decided to let him
love me because of Arnie.

448
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,534
It was on my second wedding night
that I learned the truth.

449
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,013
You didn't learn on your first?

450
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,089
This was a terrible truth...

451
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,330
The truth about Harry.

452
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,652
- Just what happened?
- How old are you, Mr Marlowe?

453
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,613
About 30.

454
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,931
This is what happened.

455
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,291
I was in the hotel room alone.
I put on my best nightie.

456
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,451
- You understand?
- Perfectly.

457
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,375
Although I had no true feeling
for Harry,

458
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,533
I worked myself into an enthusiasm
because I thought he loved me.

459
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,691
Must have been hard work.

460
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,849
There was a full moon,
and I sat by the window

461
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,171
because I thought it would show off
my new nightie to advantage.

462
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,932
Naturally.

463
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,776
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

464
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,216
You, a perfect stranger too.
I'm not boring you, am I?

465
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,291
No. Not at all.

466
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,209
- How about some more lemonade?
- Soon, soon.

467
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,611
Oh, where was I?

468
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,374
You were sitting by the window
because it was a full moon

469
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,100
and you'd worked yourself up
to a certain enthusiasm.

470
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,136
I said all that?

471
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,450
Uh, when does Harry come in?

472
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,980
He doesn't. He never came in.

473
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,179
- He called the following morning.
- The following morning?

474
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,013
In the hotel lobby the night before,
he bought a magazine.

475
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,410
- His horoscope was in it.
- Bad?

476
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,331
It said... He was a Taurus.

477
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,378
It said, 'Don't start
any new project that day.

478
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,930
- It could never be finished. '
- And what did you do?

479
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,059
I left him on the spot,
and went home to mother's. The end.

480
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,931
What a poignant story.

481
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,091
I knew you'd understand.

482
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,376
- Nobody else does.
- Not even mother?

483
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,293
She thought I should live with him,
but I wouldn't.

484
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,770
He pestered me to go back,
but I always refused.

485
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,171
Well, suppose some night
I wanted him to do something...

486
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,615
like the dishes, for example.

487
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,170
- His horoscope wouldn't let him.
- You're absolutely right.

488
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,491
There are some things
I just don't like to do by myself.

489
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,778
And no one with any true
understanding would blame you for it.

490
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,859
When Arnie was born, I moved to where
I thought Harry could never find me.

491
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,454
I changed my name and...

492
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,009
But he was persistent?

493
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,375
This morning there was a knock
on the door.

494
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,452
Before I opened it, I knew he was
standing on the other side.

495
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,736
- What did he want?
- Me!

496
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,460
He wanted me because I was his wife.

497
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,454
He wanted me because, as he put it,
he suddenly felt some basic urge...

498
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,611
- Loneliness.
- What'd you feel?

499
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,450
I felt sick. Did you see
his moustache and his wavy hair?

500
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,611
Yeah, but when I saw him,
he was dead.

501
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,216
Yeah, he looked exactly the same when
he was alive, except he was vertical.

502
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,655
So he entered. What'd you say?

503
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,732
Nothing. I hit him over the head with
a milk bottle and knocked him silly.

504
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,533
Silly?

505
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,251
Bats. Tappy.

506
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,093
He staggered up towards the woods
saying he was gonna find his wife

507
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,251
and drag her home if it killed him.

508
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,376
Apparently it did.

509
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,212
Have some more lemonade.

510
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,093
Why, Captain Wiles, what a surprise.

511
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,253
But you invited me, Miss Gravely.
At least that's how I remember it.

512
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,810
Of course I did, Captain,
but somehow, it's still a surprise.

513
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,893
Oh, yes. You certainly know
how to make a man feel wanted.

514
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,449
Won't you come in, Captain?

515
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,056
Thank you.
I... I've looked forward to it.

516
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,013
Takes a real cook to
make a good blueberry muffin,

517
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,330
to keep the blueberries
from sitting on the bottom.

518
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,692
High-bush blueberries,
that's the secret.

519
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,854
I picked 'em up near where you shot
that unfortunate man.

520
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,100
A real handsome man's cup.

521
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,608
It's been in the family for years.

522
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,374
My father always used it
up until he died.

523
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,057
I trust he died peacefully,
slipped away in the night.

524
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,889
He was caught in a threshing machine.

525
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,294
I hope I haven't distressed you,
Captain.

526
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,451
Not at all. Not at all.

527
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,578
I'm used to looking on the rough side
of things.

528
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,049
I am man who's faced death
many times.

529
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,651
Rather recently too.

530
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,617
Yeah.

531
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,571
Arnie. What are you carrying there?

532
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,053
- A rabbit.
- A rabbit?

533
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,579
- What do you call it?
- Dead. It ain't mine.

534
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,255
- Well, whose is it?
- Yours. You shot it with your gun.

535
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,253
You must've killed it today.
It should make a nice stew for ya.

536
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,729
A rabbit! I finally killed a rabbit!

537
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,131
- Where'd you get it?
- In the blueberry muffins.

538
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,249
- What?
- Out in the woods.

539
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,890
Oh, here you are. One muffin
for one rabbit. Fair enough?

540
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,051
That was a two-muffin rabbit.

541
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,251
- I gotta go now.
- Oh.

542
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,252
Hm.

543
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,612
It's, uh, certainly a nice afternoon,
Miss Gravely.

544
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,771
- Isn't it?
- Mm.

545
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,489
Yes, and you're, you're a nice woman.

546
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,732
And I think you're awfully nice,
Captain Wiles.

547
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,939
Um, um.
Let's get back to our little problem.

548
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,216
Harry. What's going to become of him?

549
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,371
Oh, now, now.
Don't you worry about Harry.

550
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,735
He'll be comfortably
underground before nightfall.

551
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,178
All that digging and work.
Couldn't you just...

552
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,811
let him slide off the end
of your boat pier into the pond?

553
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,733
And have him pop up like a cork?
No, sir.

554
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,653
Nobody ever popped up
from under four feet of ground.

555
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,256
No. Besides, they'll be
cutting ice there this winter.

556
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,139
Now wouldn't it be a nice thing
if they were cutting blocks of ice -

557
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,292
Never mind, Captain. You're right.

558
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,054
Yes. Underground is the best place
for Harry.

559
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,577
He seems comfortable, Sam,
very comfortable and snug.

560
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,300
We better find a place and get it dug
and the sooner the better.

561
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,419
If what you say about Mrs Rogers
and her husband is true, I agree.

562
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,048
Well, let's find a place.

563
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,889
No use making hard work out of it. We
need a place where the earth is soft.

564
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,450
And a place where the whole town
won't stumble over us as we work.

565
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,295
Mm. A place with a certain
character and attractiveness.

566
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,657
Facing west so that Harry
can watch the setting sun.

567
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,051
- Where it'll be cosy in winter.
- And cool in the summer.

568
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,292
You know, I'm half envying Harry.

569
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,213
It wouldn't take much longer
to dig it twice as wide.

570
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,895
Well, thanks for your kindness,
but some other time.

571
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,178
- Here. This looks like a good place.
- Ahh!

572
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,093
You're a lucky fellow, Harry Worp.

573
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,250
- Come on, off with your coat.
- Who, me?

574
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,411
Certainly you.
It's your body, isn't it?

575
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,571
I'm not much of a hand
at grave digging.

576
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,652
You should've thought of that
before you went hunting this morning.

577
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,653
Calvin Wiggs. What'll we do now?

578
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,017
Think up the best story
he's ever heard.

579
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,891
Lay down your shovel, Sam.

580
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,779
- What's the trouble?
- I'm dead beat.

581
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,091
Good.
I was dead beat ten minutes ago.

582
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,411
I wanted to keep digging
until you gave up.

583
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,852
- Brrrr! Gives me the creeps.
- Yeah?

584
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,898
Come on.
Let's get Harry and pop him in.

585
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,011
With hasty reverence.

586
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,929
There. Would you like to say
a few words, Captain?

587
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,173
Yes, I would. Harry Worp, don't ever
show your face around here again.

588
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,535
Let's finish this job
and get out of here.

589
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,976
Captain, I think Calvin Wiggs
is looking for something.

590
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,370
Think he knows Harry Worp came here?

591
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,532
Sammy, that's as horrible
a thought as you've ever had.

592
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,736
And that he wonders what happened
to Harry and where he is?

593
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,495
My only answer is to keep
on scraping, and fast.

594
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,255
If you must kill things from now on,
I wish you'd stick to rabbits.

595
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,093
- The body's smaller.
- Rabbits! I didn't tell you, did I?

596
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,412
- I shot a rabbit today!
- Don't shout. I know you did.

597
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,333
I was up at Jennifer Rogers'
when Arnie showed me the rabbit.

598
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,776
Jennifer, eh?
Didn't waste much time, did you?

599
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,931
Well, I don't blame you, Sammy.

600
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,375
A very nice widow she'll make.
Very nice.

601
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,576
Let's discuss her
when we've finished with Harry.

602
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,459
No need to get huffy. I don't want
to talk about your affairs.

603
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,690
I've got affairs of my own.

604
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,772
- You mean my protégée?
- Come again?

605
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,979
Miss Gravely. The lady I renovated
at Mrs Wiggs' this afternoon.

606
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,893
A most remarkable
reversion to femininity.

607
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,255
I don't quite get you, Sammy boy.

608
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,775
She came into the Emporium
in rather high excitement.

609
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,818
Wanted a new cup and saucer,
lots of other things.

610
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,097
I gave her a new makeup
and hairdo.

611
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,376
Don't tell me you didn't notice.

612
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,178
She's a nice lady.

613
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,934
- Very nice.
- We're all nice.

614
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,409
I don't see how anyone
could help but like guys like us.

615
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,368
I agree. I don't know whether
I've grown rose-colored glasses or -

616
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,417
Or if you're in love?

617
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,377
Aha!

618
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,577
There's nothing like finding yourself
in love.

619
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,049
No, it adds zest to your work.

620
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,415
Zest! Zest!

621
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,974
I think I've had enough zest
for a while.

622
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,531
- Let's sit down and rest, huh?
- Oh, why not. We've earned it.

623
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,690
Tell me, Sam, What did Jennifer think
of my shooting?

624
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,851
You mean Mrs Rogers?

625
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,409
Oh, I think by now I'm entitled to be
on a first-name basis with her.

626
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,219
After all, I brought her a happy
release with one bullet.

627
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,053
One bullet? How 'bout that
"No Shooting" sign that I found?

628
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,018
Well, that. One bullet
for the "No Shooting" sign,

629
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,819
one for the beer can
and one for Harry.

630
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,131
- How about the rabbit?
- And one for the ra...

631
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,051
What's the matter?

632
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,576
- What's wrong? What's bitten you?
- I only fired three bullets.

633
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,210
Three! One for the shooting sign,
one for the beer can -

634
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,416
And one for the little man
who's lying in the grave.

635
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,048
No, Sammy, no. That's just it.
One for the rabbit.

636
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,370
If I shot the rabbit,
I didn't shoot Harry.

637
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,054
Oh, Sammy boy, what have you
tried to make me do?

638
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,211
Tried to make a murderer out of me.

639
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,293
Well, don't sit there. Help me!
You helped bury him.

640
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,689
Even if you didn't kill him, why dig
him up now that he's nicely planted?

641
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,930
I promised Jennifer
that we'd bury him.

642
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,091
Keep my word, he should stay buried.

643
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,978
Besides whether you killed him
or not, you've incriminated yourself.

644
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,213
You'll have more of a job explaining
a body that you didn't kill and bury,

645
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,055
than a body that you accidentally
killed and buried, right, Captain?

646
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,089
You're not supposed to bury bodies
whenever you find them.

647
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,330
It makes people suspicious.

648
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,139
Supposed to tell the police
or advertise or something.

649
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,095
Oh, Sammy, you don't understand.
You don't comprehend one bit.

650
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,377
You wouldn't like me to go through
life not knowing if I've killed him?

651
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,890
Very inconsistent. First, you tell me
you've got no conscience.

652
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,574
Now you talk about something that
sounds remarkably like a conscience.

653
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,731
Oh, Sammy, come on. Help me.

654
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,892
I don't care if I killed him or not,
for all that matters.

655
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,451
But I'll get the shakes
whenever I see a policeman.

656
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,577
All right.

657
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,891
If I had my choice, I'd rather be
thought a murderer than proved one.

658
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,929
Thank you. With two of us digging,
we'll have Harry out in nothing flat.

659
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,614
Can't see much from here. I'd better
get in down there and look at him.

660
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,773
- Let me do the honours.
- OK, Sammy. You've got good eyes.

661
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,098
Hey, that isn't a bullet wound.

662
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,889
Isn't a bullet wound?
Well, what d'ya know.

663
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,858
That's what they call a blow
with a blunt instrument.

664
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,454
Huh? What are you thinking, Sammy?

665
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,054
I think, Captain Wiles,
we're tangled up in a murder.

666
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,851
Murder? If it's murder, who done it?

667
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,377
- Who did it?
- That's what I say, who done it?

668
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,930
Apart from Jennifer Rogers,
who else'd want to kill him?

669
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,331
Apart from Jennifer?

670
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,731
- Yeah. Do you think that she would -
- Oh, it's ridiculous.

671
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,653
You said she was surprised to see
the body when she came up here.

672
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,015
You said she hit him on the head.

673
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,375
Coming home from Madagascar once,
we had a fireman on board

674
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,179
who hit his head on a brick wall
and died two days later.

675
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,570
Where could he find a brick wall
on board a ship?

676
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,538
Hmmm, that's what we always wondered.

677
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,175
Couldn't have been Jennifer. No.

678
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,729
Besides, what's it matter who did it?

679
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,698
It'll be better for all of us
if he's buried and out of the way.

680
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,932
Nothing doing. I'm not burying
someone else's bad habits.

681
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,295
Hmm? Suppose it was Miss Gravely?

682
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,850
What?

683
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,215
No, it's not as funny as all that.

684
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,371
You said yourself she wasn't
particularly startled

685
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,531
to see you dragging Harry
up the path.

686
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,294
You artists have got no idea
of etiquette.

687
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:17,499
She is a lady of gentle habits and
upbringing who hides her feelings.

688
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,811
If I wasn't holding Harry's ankles,
she'd have never mentioned him.

689
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,015
Really?

690
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,057
When she said...

691
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,575
'What seems to be the trouble,
Captain? ',

692
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,890
it was nothing more
than a pleasantry, so to speak.

693
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:34,692
Like, 'Nice day, isn't it? ' 'I'm
sure, yes. ' Or something like that.

694
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,374
Going to help me bury him again?

695
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,737
Um... I don't know.

696
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,415
'Course, it might have been
Dr Greenbow or the tramp.

697
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:48,050
- Or Jennifer?
- I told you it couldn't...

698
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:52,338
Well, no point in arguing about it.
Let's get rid of him.

699
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,250
OK. You helped me in my hour of need.
I guess it's up to me to help you.

700
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,014
We'll file Harry away
once and for all.

701
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,330
No more nonsense about it.

702
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,253
Come aboard, Miss Gravely,
come aboard.

703
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,980
It's just an old salt's
snug anchorage.

704
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,610
Small, not palatial like yours,
But homely, very...

705
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,851
Won't you sit down, Miss Gravely?

706
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,451
Thank you.

707
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,453
It's funny. Funny how we got to be
so friendly in one afternoon.

708
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:06,408
I knew you weren't as prim
and starchy as they made out. No.

709
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,571
Not by a long shot.

710
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,617
- Really?
- No.

711
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,011
I'm a man who can recognise
the human qualities in a woman.

712
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,171
When I first saw you
down where Harry was -

713
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,331
- Captain Wiles.
- Yes, ma'am?

714
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,968
Before you make your kind thoughts
known to me,

715
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,928
I should like to offer you some
explanation of my sudden invitation

716
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,739
to coffee and blueberry muffins
this afternoon

717
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,812
and my...
and my sitting with you here now.

718
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,050
No, ma'am,
you don't have to explain anything.

719
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:37,008
You came to my aid at a moment of
crisis, for which I'm truly grateful.

720
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,216
Thank you, but it's just that
I owe you some reason.

721
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,575
No, no, no.
I won't hear a word of it.

722
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,095
You saw the predicament I was in
with that body on my hands

723
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,458
and you shut your eyes to it in a
most sporting fashion, if I say so.

724
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,736
- Captain Wiles.
- Yes, ma'am?

725
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,495
I'm trying to tell you the reason
I asked you to coffee and muffins.

726
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,094
It was because... I felt -

727
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,251
- Sympathy.
- Gratitude.

728
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,139
Gra...? But I'm the one
who should be grateful.

729
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,976
No, I was grateful.
I... I am grateful.

730
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,974
I'm grateful to you
for burying my body.

731
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,897
Your body?

732
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,535
The man you thought you killed...

733
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,739
was the man I hit over the head with
the leather heel of my hiking shoe.

734
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,015
You?

735
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,850
And with a metal cleat
on the end of it.

736
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,135
But why?

737
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,811
He annoyed me.

738
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,414
I was walking towards home when he

739
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,889
suddenly came at me
with a wild look in his eye

740
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,857
and insisted...

741
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,251
- we were married.
- Oh, you knew each other before.

742
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:50,413
Believe it or not, I had never
seen him before in my life and...

743
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,094
if I ever had,
I never would have married him.

744
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,569
He must have mistaken you
for someone else.

745
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,449
Oh, no, he very definitely
pulled me into the bushes.

746
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,138
- Yes?
- I came out again.

747
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,617
Go on.

748
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,771
He pulled me back.

749
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,099
Twice.

750
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,859
He swore at me,
horrible, masculine sounds.

751
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,092
- I didn't understand it, of course.
- Of course you didn't.

752
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,849
- We fought.
- Then what?

753
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:27,657
I won. My shoe had come off
in the struggle, and I hit him.

754
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,449
I hit him as hard as ever I could.

755
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,331
You killed him.

756
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,733
I must have done it.
I was annoyed, Captain.

757
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,936
- Very annoyed.
- Naturally.

758
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,092
I don't think
I've ever been so annoyed.

759
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:52,890
Consequently, I... I didn't
realise my own capabilities.

760
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,972
Whew! Seems to me...

761
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,132
Mrs Rogers knocked him silly,
and you finished him off.

762
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,135
Why should Mrs Rogers
knock him silly?

763
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,291
She was really his wife.

764
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,577
Poor woman.
I thought she had better taste.

765
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,371
You know, Captain,

766
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,215
when I ran away I decided I would
never tell a soul what had happened.

767
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,814
Then I met you, and I thought...

768
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,976
how convenient it was that you
should think that you had shot him.

769
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,291
- Forgive me for thinking that.
- Only natural.

770
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:32,056
That's why I felt... I still feel
under an obligation to you.

771
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,415
Oh, not at all. Let's forget it.

772
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,458
Oh, no, we mustn't do that.
It would hardly be fair to you.

773
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:43,288
For you to go through life knowing
you had buried a man you didn't kill.

774
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,735
You would have my crime
on your conscience.

775
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,619
It's a pleasure,
I'm sure.

776
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,816
But no.

777
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,097
Now I realise that Harry man
was out of his mind,

778
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,251
and my action was justifiable,

779
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:00,129
there's no reason we shouldn't let
the authorities know about it.

780
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,656
- The authorities?
- Everything will be cleared up.

781
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,493
I'm sure Calvin Wiggs and the police

782
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,890
won't make a fuss about it
when we explain.

783
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,255
Perhaps it needn't get
into the papers at all.

784
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:14,537
Don't you believe it. They love it,
the papers, this kind of thing.

785
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,930
Murder and passion.

786
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,660
You let Harry be.
Just forget it ever happened.

787
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,256
The same as Sammy and me
and Jennifer Rogers are going to do.

788
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,811
Oh, but... but it isn't your body.

789
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:32,258
After all, I killed him, so it's only
fair that I should have the say so -

790
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,012
- Yes, but -
- Don't you agree?

791
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,852
- Well, in a way -
- I thought you would.

792
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,817
I tell you what, Captain.

793
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,374
- We'll go and get a spade now.
- But ma'am -

794
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,054
And after we've dug him up,
we'll go back to my place

795
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,212
and I'll make you
some hot chocolate.

796
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,417
Arnie's so tired he'll sleep all day
and half the night.

797
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,253
I think you've got a pretty house,
Jennifer.

798
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,457
It's the best I could do
on Robert's insurance.

799
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,049
- Sugar?
- No, black, thanks.

800
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,657
It's funny, but...

801
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:54,050
I feel awful comfortable with you,
Sam.

802
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,575
You know, I feel the same way too.

803
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,731
It's a good feeling,

804
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:05,098
feeling comfortable with someone
who feels that way too.

805
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,180
There is one thing
I feel uncomfortable about.

806
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,332
Just tell me what it is,
and I'll take care of it for you.

807
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,096
- It's Harry. What about Harry?
- Harry? Don't you think about Harry.

808
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,411
Harry's part of the earth.
He's with eternity, the ages.

809
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,048
Take my word for it,
Harry's ancient history.

810
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,571
Come in, whoever it is.

811
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,571
What happened?

812
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,254
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

813
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,730
No, Captain,
I have something to tell him.

814
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,539
Now who's going to tell what?

815
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,976
I killed Harry
with the heel of my shoe.

816
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,772
So it was you.

817
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,056
We're on our way to get Calvin Wiggs.

818
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,292
- And have him call the state police.
- I keep telling her there's no need.

819
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:00,289
He's right and, besides, it'd be
indecent. Harry's dead and buried.

820
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,576
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

821
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,571
You haven't dug him up again.

822
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:07,651
Well, I...

823
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,490
I insisted, Mr Marlowe.

824
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:20,369
- Don't you understand?
- You have nothing to fear.

825
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,091
It's my concern entirely.

826
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,969
As soon as Captain Wiles told me the
full circumstances of his being here

827
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,131
I knew there was nothing for me
to hide.

828
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,291
You know all about Harry?

829
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,690
Well, I'm afraid I do, Mrs Rogers,
and...

830
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,375
and after all, nobody could possibly
gossip about a lady and a maniac.

831
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,531
You'd be surprised.

832
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,339
You don't quite understand
what murder involves, Miss Gravely.

833
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,730
It'd be hours and hours
of questioning and photographs,

834
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,619
and the whole of your private life
spread indecently in the newspapers.

835
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,897
What makes you think
my private life is indecent?

836
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,733
I didn't mean that. I meant that
the way they pry is indecent.

837
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,412
They'll hound you to death.

838
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,571
There'll be newspapermen,
photographers, detectives.

839
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,810
I've made up my mind.

840
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,971
She certainly has.

841
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,779
It was Captain Wiles here
who persuaded me to call

842
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,534
and tell Mrs Rogers
what I proposed to do.

843
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,579
After all, she is most closely
connected with the business.

844
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,015
What do you think about it,
Mrs Rogers?

845
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,297
I can't see why you're all
making such a fuss about Harry.

846
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,611
If he was buried, I don't see
why you had to dig him up.

847
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,738
But since you have, I guess
you'd better do what you think best.

848
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,290
I don't care what you do with him,
as long as you don't revive him.

849
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,371
I have a free hand, then.

850
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:36,692
Free as a bird. As far as I'm
concerned, it's ancient history.

851
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,851
Wait a minute, Jennifer.

852
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,170
I think we've forgotten something.

853
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,173
Do you realise if this comes out,
that all the details of your marriage

854
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,535
will be public property?

855
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,259
Oh.

856
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:54,289
- I hadn't thought of that either.
- Where'd you put Harry this time?

857
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,291
Over by the big oak tree.

858
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,651
- I'll get my shovel.
- I'm causing you a lot of hard work.

859
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,936
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all, Not at all.

860
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,889
Well, let's all go up there.

861
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,889
You know, I've never been to a
home-made funeral before.

862
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,449
Hm. I have.

863
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,214
This is my third.

864
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:20,055
All in one day.

865
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,857
Well, let's get it over with.

866
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,817
Yes.

867
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,494
I think we ought to cement it over.

868
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:46,891
Next spring
I'll set out some blueberry bushes.

869
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,574
Couldn't you make it
something else? Lilac, maybe.

870
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,731
I think nature'll
will take good care of it.

871
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,370
- How about a service?
- I Can't think of what to say.

872
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:58,418
- Besides, my arms ache.
- It's late for a prayer.

873
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:01,777
Besides, wherever he was going,
he's there now.

874
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,249
Bye, Harry. I forgive you.

875
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:16,170
- Trumpets welcoming Harry.
- You didn't know Harry.

876
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:20,094
I want to paint you, Jennifer.
You're beautiful in the moonlight.

877
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,011
Sounds as if it's
coming down from near the village.

878
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,775
I know what it is.
The call of the phantom stagecoach

879
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,659
that used to pass by here
each night 200 years ago.

880
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:35,211
- Phantom ghost?
- The turnpike ran across the hills.

881
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,019
Oh, to be a highwayman
on a night like this.

882
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:40,330
Listen. Somebody's running.

883
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,094
- Horses?
- A horse that can shout.

884
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,093
- What's she saying?
- We'll know soon. She's coming here.

885
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:50,811
- Sam Marlowe!
- It's Wiggy. Old Wiggy.

886
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,051
Mr Marlowe!

887
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,734
Mr Marlowe!

888
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:00,132
- Wiggy, what on earth do you want?
- I... He wants...

889
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,416
- Wait a minute, Catch your breath.
- He's a millionaire!

890
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:05,572
- Who?
- He wants to buy your pictures.

891
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,651
- Which pictures?
- All of 'em and more besides.

892
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,811
He says you're a genius.

893
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:13,177
He's right, but it's hard to believe
he wants to buy all my pictures.

894
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,695
I'd be too curious
to refuse to at least to talk to him.

895
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,090
Don't turn down
a good chance, Mr Marlowe.

896
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,569
All right, I'll talk to him.

897
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,137
- We dug sassafras root.
- Sassafras tea is healthy.

898
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,292
Mr Wiggs always swore it cured
his arthritis just before he died.

899
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,451
How much does
the millionaire want to pay?

900
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:35,011
I said seven dollars for the one that
looks like blobs in a thunderstorm.

901
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,171
- And?
- He said they are priceless.

902
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,173
Priceless? Sounds like
something I painted in kindergarten.

903
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:43,138
That picture is symbolic
to the beginning of the world.

904
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,768
That's where I first heard
of the world, in kindergarten.

905
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:50,490
Yes, and my friend here, art critic
for the modern museum, he -

906
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,255
Don't think I'm rude, but it doesn't
matter to me what an art critic says.

907
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,457
- Is that so?
- I know my paintings are good.

908
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,851
He doesn't want them, you do. So
all that matters is what you think.

909
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:05,536
Well, I think they are works of
genius, and I want to buy them all.

910
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,735
- Too bad.
- Why?

911
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,256
Just decided I can't sell them.
Besides, you couldn't afford them.

912
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,411
Oh.

913
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:17,253
- Uh...
- Money.

914
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:21,095
Sammy. Don't be a fool.
Make him pay through the nose.

915
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,093
Go ahead, Mr Marlowe, be reasonable.

916
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:28,094
- Be unreasonable, if you want.
- What do you say?

917
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,615
It's your genius, Sam.
It's up to you.

918
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:40,490
All right then. What do you like most
in the whole world?

919
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,697
I don't know. Strawberries, I guess.

920
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,451
Strawberries. Write that down.

921
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:52,215
Two boxes of fresh strawberries, each
month, in season and out of season,

922
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,336
from now on.

923
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,491
Well, it's simple. What else?

924
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,651
What would Arnie like?

925
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,131
A chemical set.

926
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,212
- What kind?
- Whatever smells the worst.

927
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,611
- Got that?
- Right.

928
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,374
One smelly chemical set.

929
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,531
Wiggy, Wiggy, what would you like?

930
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,895
Cash register, chromium plated,
one that rings a bell.

931
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,335
- Got room for one?
- I'll find room.

932
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,094
- Cash register.
- Chromium plated, rings a bell.

933
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,899
Check.

934
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,813
Miss Gravely,
a beauty parlour, fully equipped?

935
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,971
What for?

936
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:31,691
A hope chest... filled with things
I should have put in it but didn't.

937
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,299
A hope chest, full of hope.

938
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,617
Captain?

939
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,738
A good shotgun, plenty of ammunition,

940
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:45,894
some corduroy britches, a plain shirt
and a hunting cap. A brown one.

941
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,489
Davy Crockett, the works.

942
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,651
Well, that's it, I guess.

943
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:54,812
- The paintings are yours.
- Yes, but what about you?

944
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,335
Yes, Sam,
you've gotta ask for something.

945
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,891
Well, let's see.

946
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,697
That's it.

947
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,452
What's it?

948
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,417
Pardon me.

949
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,371
What do you think?

950
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,931
Yes,
I think that can be easily arranged.

951
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,571
Well. That's it, then.

952
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,698
I'll come back in the morning
for all these paintings.

953
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,691
Mr Marlowe,

954
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,772
this has been a night that I shall
remember the rest of my life.

955
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:35,738
Come back again. I'll have some more
paintings for you next month.

956
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:39,051
And you'll have a steady customer
in me,

957
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,654
even if you raise your prices.

958
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:44,937
- Well, good night, everyone.
- Good night.

959
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,330
All right, young man.

960
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,370
Congratulations, Sammy!
Good boy!

961
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:58,250
- Did I do the right thing?
- You did just the right thing, Sam.

962
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,411
Good.

963
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,615
Because it's important to me
that you think so.

964
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,691
Why?

965
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,658
Because I love you.
I want to marry you.

966
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,171
Oh!

967
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:19,010
- You want to marry me?
- Uh-huh. Why not?

968
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,412
Well...
because I just got my freedom today.

969
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,889
Easy come, easy go.

970
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:30,053
Besides, if you married me,
you'd keep your freedom.

971
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,420
You must be practically unique, then.

972
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:37,255
I respect freedom.
More than that, I love freedom.

973
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,412
We might be the only free
married couple in the world.

974
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,569
This is very sudden, Sam.

975
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,452
You'll have to give me
a little time to think about it.

976
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,374
Only fair. I'll give you
until we get back to your house.

977
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,570
- What's goin' on here at this hour?
- The most wonderful thing.

978
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:09,129
Mr Marlowe sold all his paintings
to a millionaire.

979
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,609
- Got more'n I ever figured he'd get.
- Money?

980
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,931
Well, not exactly money.

981
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:18,013
I always knew
they weren't worth the space.

982
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:21,695
I found these on a tramp
hangin' 'round here.

983
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,420
Said he found 'em on a... dead man.

984
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,252
Took me to where he said
he found him, and...

985
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,692
I didn't see any body.

986
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,290
Montpelier 2000.

987
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,020
- That's the state police.
- Uh huh.

988
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,853
I think, uh, we'd better get going.

989
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,295
Thank you for the cash register.

990
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,451
It was a pleasure. Good night.

991
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,576
Good night. Good night.

992
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,731
- Good night.
- Good night.

993
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,891
Good night, Captain.

994
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,690
This is Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs.

995
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,851
Yeah, I'll wait.

996
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,658
Ma?

997
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,697
Yes?

998
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,852
- This picture here on the floor.
- It's a new one.

999
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,375
He did it today,
but it isn't for sale.

1000
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,213
- Why not?
- You'll have to ask him that.

1001
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,178
He left it on his way
over to Jennifer Roger's house.

1002
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,899
Guess he didn't have time
to take it home.

1003
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,256
You suddenly got interested in art?

1004
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,098
No.

1005
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:49,094
But... it's just that it matches
the description of -

1006
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,569
Oh, hello, Sergeant.

1007
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:53,731
Calvin Wiggs.

1008
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,778
Got something
that might interest you a little.

1009
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,410
It seems I picked up this tramp
with a pair of stolen shoes...

1010
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,889
and a wild story about a corpse.

1011
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:26,619
What do you think? Him walking in
with Harry Worp's shoes in his hand?

1012
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:28,771
And then that phone call
to the police?

1013
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:33,331
I don't know. I may be wrong, but I
don't think he's tied us into it yet.

1014
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,491
Oh, the way he looked at me.

1015
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:38,254
If he'd known anything,
he'd have kept us there.

1016
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:42,459
But modern police methods
are all psychological now, Sammy.

1017
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:47,091
They just wear you down
and wear you down until...

1018
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:51,651
you're almost grateful
to get into that gas chamber.

1019
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:56,610
The police would probably tell him,
if the shoes fit, to keep them.

1020
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,771
Oh, well.

1021
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:11,452
- I've decided, Sam.
- Decided what?

1022
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:16,091
I will marry you, if you haven't
forgotten about asking me.

1023
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,937
I'm... I'm very fond of you and...

1024
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:24,809
I think you'd make a good father
for Arnie.

1025
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:29,053
And for some other reasons
best left unsaid.

1026
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:32,214
Marriage is the comfortable way
to spend the winter,

1027
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,019
but right now we should be
working on some good story

1028
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:38,809
to satisfy the State Police
if they should turn up.

1029
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:42,973
Would you believe it?
I'd almost forgotten that proposal.

1030
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:46,496
- I have witnesses, Sam.
- Oh, I remember now.

1031
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:50,289
All right,
you've got yourself a husband.

1032
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,258
I think I'll kiss you now
to prove it.

1033
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,495
Lightly, Sam.
I have a very short fuse.

1034
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:16,015
What a pretty sight.

1035
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:25,933
Sam, what did you ask
the millionaire for?

1036
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,455
That's very practical.

1037
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,969
- Congratulations, my dear.
- You're a lucky man, Sammy.

1038
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,859
- I think you'll both be very happy.
- Thank you.

1039
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:49,377
If I grumbled too much at my share of
the work in burying Harry, I'm sorry.

1040
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,690
I can see now it was well worth it.

1041
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,978
- And if I can do anything else -
- Hold it! Hold it, hold it!

1042
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,011
What's wrong, Sam?

1043
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,058
Harry. We're not quite finished
with him yet.

1044
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,530
Sam, if anybody's through, it's
Harry. He's been buried three times.

1045
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,930
Before we can get married, you're
gonna have to prove that you're free.

1046
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,091
To prove you're free, you'll
have to prove that Harry -

1047
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,012
Is dead.

1048
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,931
What a horrible complication.

1049
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,091
Oh!

1050
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:21,331
I don't know that it is.

1051
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,532
What are you looking at me for?
You...

1052
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:30,260
Sammy, I'll do anything to help you,
but please,

1053
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,934
please don't ask me to dig up
Harry again!

1054
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,172
- Oh, come, come now, Captain.
- No, we can't.

1055
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:39,059
- You're thinking of bad publicity -
- No, I'm not.

1056
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:43,975
I think Sam would be worth
just about anything.

1057
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,529
I'm thinking of you, Miss Gravely.

1058
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:50,898
Murder is murder, no matter how
exonerating the circumstances.

1059
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,654
It just wouldn't look nice at all
for you.

1060
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,493
That's right!
Better let him stay where he is.

1061
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,255
You'll only have to wait seven years
to presume death, anyway.

1062
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,253
- Seven years! I'll be an old man.
- Don't be silly.

1063
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,456
You waited far longer
than seven years already.

1064
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,009
Yes, but now I know
what I'm waiting for.

1065
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,569
I insist that you dig
the wretched man up.

1066
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:12,935
I don't care a hoot what they say.

1067
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,410
They'd only have to know me to
realise the man must have been mad.

1068
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,573
- I disagree! Huh!
- Really, Captain Wiles?

1069
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,172
Well...

1070
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:28,811
I'll dig him up but we'd better
get it done before Calvin Wiggs

1071
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:32,131
gets the state police
snooping around here.

1072
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,209
I've been thinking.

1073
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,497
I've been thinking maybe we could
forget the way it really happened.

1074
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,652
I could tell how Harry visited me
and went off in such a rage today

1075
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,209
and that's all we'd need to know
about his being there.

1076
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:52,371
No, somebody else
might get the blame.

1077
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,452
And somebody else might not
have such a good reason as I did.

1078
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,460
What do you mean 'somebody else'?

1079
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:04,258
I can think of two people with
a good reason for having killed him.

1080
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,295
First you, because you married him.
And now Sam.

1081
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,452
Me? Why would I want to kill him?
I never met him before.

1082
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,054
You could still have a reason
for killing him.

1083
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,176
- She means me.
- Yes.

1084
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,616
I didn't fall in love with Jennifer
until after Harry was dead.

1085
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,657
Try telling that to the police.

1086
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,811
She's right, Sammy boy.

1087
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:29,059
On second thought, we'd better stick
to the truth, what there is of it.

1088
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,379
We must think up a reason why the
police weren't informed before now.

1089
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:42,691
Yes, then there's the condition he's
in. That will take some explaining.

1090
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,411
We'll just clean him up a bit.

1091
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:48,094
It's horrible,
but there's nothing else we can do.

1092
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,649
We can't risk complicating
Miss Gravely's confession.

1093
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:54,415
As for the delay, I can explain that
I was so upset by the occurrence

1094
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,935
that I went straight home and rested.

1095
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,536
- Only natural.
- They'll think you had a long rest.

1096
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,533
Sam, I'd rather not spend
the whole night debating.

1097
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,089
Let's get Harry someplace
and clean him up.

1098
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:10,139
Let's get out of here.

1099
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:24,056
Love alters not
with his brief hours and weeks,

1100
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,769
But bears it out
even to the edge of doom,

1101
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,738
If this be error and upon me proved,

1102
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,654
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

1103
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:48,093
I, uh, I think he met with a bit
of an accident, Dr Greenbow.

1104
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,251
He certainly did.

1105
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,571
Which of you found him?

1106
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:56,413
- Well -
- He was my husband, Doctor.

1107
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:01,292
Oh, Mrs Rogers. I didn't know you
had a husband. I'm awfully sorry.

1108
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:05,332
It's all right, Doctor.
It's just life, I guess.

1109
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,934
- What happened to him?
- Well, he -

1110
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,651
We want to know too. Can you say what
caused his death? It was so sudden.

1111
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,288
In this light, my opinion
would be little more than a guess.

1112
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:18,258
In that case, we could take him
someplace where you could see better.

1113
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,617
All right, but I need my bag.
Where should we meet?

1114
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,578
I'll take Harry home to my house.

1115
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,529
Going home for the last time.

1116
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:37,090
Better be the last time.

1117
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,651
Come on, Sam. I've got
about one more trip left in me.

1118
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,811
I'll get your coats.

1119
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:37,609
I'll get the suspenders on.

1120
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:47,819
I can't wait for this to be ready.
I'll have to iron it dry.

1121
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,691
Isn't it odd?

1122
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:55,251
After refusing for so long, here
I am finally doing Harry's laundry.

1123
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:16,252
Ah!
Look.

1124
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,939
It's nothing to get excited about,
Captain.

1125
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,375
It's only a closet door.

1126
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,574
Oh. I thought it was Harry.

1127
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,093
Relax, Captain.

1128
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:37,136
What about the cut I made on his head
with my hiking shoe?

1129
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,973
Hmm.
I'll put some adhesive tape on it.

1130
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,131
They'll think it was done
before he died.

1131
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,098
After the shirt's finished,
it should be just about everything.

1132
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,495
- If that who I think it is -
- Calvin Wigg's car.

1133
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,294
Just one second.

1134
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,014
Well, Calvin Wiggs. What a surprise.

1135
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:28,853
- Sam here?
- Yes, yes, yes, he's here.

1136
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,011
Can I see him a minute?

1137
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,091
- Sam?
- Yeah?

1138
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,889
- Calvin Wiggs is here to see you.
- Tell him I'll be right out.

1139
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:41,370
- He says he'll be right out.
- Why don't I just go on in?

1140
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,657
Evening, Calvin.

1141
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,812
Evening, Captain Wiles.
Miss Gravely.

1142
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:54,369
We've got 'em on the run
in four spades.

1143
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:58,533
They should have been in diamonds.
Play much bridge?

1144
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,089
- Never play it.
- That's what I thought.

1145
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,898
Something you wanted, Calvin?

1146
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:07,134
- Where were you today, Sam?
- Working, as usual.

1147
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:10,019
Somewheres down
by Mansfield Meadows?

1148
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,494
Possibly. I do quite a bit
of sketching around. Why?

1149
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,215
Is that where, uh...

1150
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,210
Where you painted this?

1151
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,575
I left that portrait
with your mother.

1152
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:30,334
What right do you have to carry it
around with you? It might be damaged.

1153
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,254
Yeah. It could be priceless,
and Sam would lose a sale.

1154
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,059
Oh, I'll send him a box of
blueberries the first of every month.

1155
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,812
Sam, what I wanna know is where'd
you paint it and who is it.

1156
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,133
First of all, it's not a painting,
it's a drawing.

1157
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:48,612
Matter of fact, it's a pastel and...
as for the model...

1158
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:51,658
- It just came to me out of the blue.
- You don't say.

1159
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,175
Why are you acting
like a deputy sheriff?

1160
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,900
That tramp I picked up,
the one with the stolen shoes?

1161
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,528
Said he got 'em off a dead man?

1162
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:03,579
He described him very carefully. The
description fits the picture exactly.

1163
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:07,335
A tramp who probably can't keep
his job and drinks too much.

1164
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,775
I wouldn't think his word
was very reliable.

1165
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,849
Got him locked up
in the schoolhouse.

1166
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,375
- I took the painting to show him -
- Drawing, if you don't mind.

1167
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,531
I took the drawing to show him.

1168
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,691
He almost fainted.
Said it was the same face.

1169
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,452
Where'd you paint it, Sam?

1170
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,294
From my vast subconscious.

1171
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:30,055
Sam, I hate to say this,
but I don't believe you.

1172
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,211
With all this talk,
I've lost interest in the game.

1173
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:34,530
If you'll forgive me,
I'll just run along home.

1174
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,736
I'll see you all tomorrow.

1175
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,895
What do you mean,
you don't believe me?

1176
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:46,692
What I mean, Sam...
I ain't educated in fancy art...

1177
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:50,614
but I do know the face of a dead
man when I see one, and this is it.

1178
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:54,375
Calvin, perhaps I can
educate you to, um, 'fancy art. '

1179
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:59,096
See this -
Portrait of a sleeping face.

1180
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:03,697
A man, relaxed,
far removed from earthly cares.

1181
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:07,773
It was conceived out of memory
and half-forgotten impulse,

1182
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:10,135
and it emerged from the shadows
of abstract emotions,

1183
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,291
until it was born full-grown from...

1184
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,256
the mechanical realities
of my fingertips.

1185
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,934
- Oh, now Sam, don't -
- I don't need a model to draw from.

1186
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,568
Instead of creating a sleeping face,
I could have...

1187
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:24,016
chosen an entirely different set
of artistic stimuli.

1188
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:27,934
My subconscious is peopled
with enough faces to cover the Earth.

1189
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,298
And the construction of the human
anatomy is so infinitely variable

1190
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:35,213
as to lie beyond the wildest powers
of calculation.

1191
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:39,259
Now, a raised eyelid, perhaps.

1192
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:45,138
A line of fullness to the cheek.

1193
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,214
Lip that bends with expression.

1194
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,852
There.

1195
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:57,093
- Sam, do you know what you just did?
- Certainly.

1196
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:00,218
I just showed you how clearly
you misinterpreted my art.

1197
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,177
You just destroyed legal evidence.

1198
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:08,249
Calvin, it appears to me
you still don't understand.

1199
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:11,139
I understand you made kind of a fool
out of me.

1200
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,690
But I still got enough evidence
to know something funny's going on.

1201
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:18,250
I ain't goin' to sleep
till I find out what it is.

1202
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:22,529
Good night, Calvin.

1203
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,889
Hey! What's he doin' in our bathtub?

1204
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,055
- That's where frogs belong.
- Oh.

1205
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:38,337
- Back to bed, Arnie. Back to bed.
- State troopers here in the morning.

1206
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,856
I'm gonna want 'em to have a talk
with you, so be around.

1207
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:44,534
- I said back to bed.
- You can find me in my studio.

1208
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,533
Just make sure.

1209
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,497
Where is he?

1210
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:57,492
He... he's in the bathroom
playing with his frog.

1211
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,932
Oh?

1212
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,251
Um... This way, please, Doctor.

1213
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,371
It's Arnie. He's not very well.

1214
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:14,570
Someone must be foolin' around
with my car.

1215
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:27,330
What are you playin'
with the horn for? It ain't your car.

1216
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,094
Well, things are funny, you know?

1217
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:33,377
Me and Miss Gravely might be in the
car market. We're looking for a car.

1218
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:36,373
Yes. Had a look at this one.
It's a beauty.

1219
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:38,531
I want to keep it that way.

1220
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:41,737
Now, now, that's not the way
to talk to a prospective customer.

1221
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:46,132
You're no prospective customer.
You can't afford this car.

1222
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,051
He's gone.

1223
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:02,496
I put the little...
I put Arnie back to bed.

1224
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,254
- What'd the doctor say?
- He said for me to get out.

1225
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:09,208
I didn't like the look in his eye.
Something seems to be bothering him.

1226
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:15,209
Well, Captain,
did you get over being frightened?

1227
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,932
Frightened?

1228
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:22,332
Oh, no, that's not why I left. No.

1229
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,855
I'm not easily frightened,
you know. No.

1230
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:28,649
Why, after all those years sailing
the four corners of the globe,

1231
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:32,096
strange ports, a lot of rough men
and...

1232
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:38,534
Miss Gravely, what would you say...

1233
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,691
if I told you...

1234
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,579
I was only the captain
of a tugboat...

1235
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:45,731
on the East River...

1236
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:49,210
and never got more than a mile
or so off shore?

1237
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,849
Well, I would say that...

1238
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,580
that you were the handsomest
tugboat captain

1239
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,856
that ever sailed up the East River.

1240
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,533
Oh, maybe not. No.

1241
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,373
You want to see something?
Here. Here.

1242
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,291
- Captain.
- Where'd you get those?

1243
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:17,169
Calvin Wiggs' car.

1244
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,410
I figured you were handling
half the evidence, Sammy,

1245
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,571
so it was up to me
to take care of the rest.

1246
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:23,492
You're the sweetest captain.

1247
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,538
Why is he in the bath?

1248
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,498
Well, uh...
What'd you find out, Doctor?

1249
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:34,573
Oh, that.
It was his heart. He had a seizure.

1250
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:38,210
- His heart?
- A seizure!

1251
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:40,371
Well, I'll take a trip
to the Philippines!

1252
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:43,259
- Death from natural causes.
- Well, certainly.

1253
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:47,295
But will somebody tell me what he's
doin' in the bathtub half undressed?

1254
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:52,849
Frankly, we didn't want
Calvin Wiggs to see him.

1255
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,369
Besides, he was awful dirty
after we dug him up.

1256
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,735
Dug him up?

1257
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,414
I'd better explain, Doctor, you see,

1258
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:04,378
Harry's been buried and dug up
on and off all day long.

1259
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:05,939
What?

1260
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,568
Finally, he caused so many
complications that

1261
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,891
we decided to clean him up
and put him back where we found him.

1262
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,290
I don't understand you.
What complications?

1263
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:17,091
Well, for example,

1264
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:20,138
he upset Captain Wiles because the
captain thought he had shot him.

1265
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,815
The hole in the head. But as it
turned out, it wasn't the captain.

1266
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,972
Miss Gravely hit him with the heel
of her shoe after he attacked her.

1267
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,650
Captain Wiles attacked Miss Gravely?

1268
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:32,812
Oh, no, Doctor, Harry.

1269
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:35,016
He dragged her into the bushes,
thinking it was me.

1270
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:39,215
He was dazed, I supposed, after I hit
him on the head with a milk bottle.

1271
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:45,773
The captain and Sam buried him first.

1272
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:48,454
The captain was so scared.

1273
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:52,693
Then he accounted for all his
bullets, so up Harry came.

1274
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:55,010
Then Miss Gravely thought her shoe
was responsible for it so -

1275
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,171
- Shoe?
- So the captain,

1276
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:01,049
rather gallantly, I thought,
pushed him back in again.

1277
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:04,417
Then he was out and back and...
I can't remember why.

1278
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:07,333
But anyway, he's out again now
because Sam and I wanna get married.

1279
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:11,489
- Yeah. But why did you -
- Hit him on the head?

1280
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:15,650
That wouldn't interest you.
It's purely personal and non-medical.

1281
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,857
Besides, it's awfully late, so if
you'll keep quiet about all this,

1282
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,011
we'll put Harry back in the morning,
nice and clean,

1283
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:23,171
and no one will be any the wiser.

1284
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,331
And then we'll be rid of all these
sticky complications.

1285
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,968
Put him back, put him back,
that's all.

1286
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:31,815
This is the first nightmare
I've had in 25 years.

1287
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,931
He's kinda strange, isn't he?

1288
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,859
Well, um,
hadn't we better get Harry dressed?

1289
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,011
Yes, yes.

1290
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,052
Couldn't Arnie find him again?

1291
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:01,053
Then he'd run home and tell me,
and then I'd phone Calvin Wiggs.

1292
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,098
Yes! Arnie could explain
quite clearly to Calvin -

1293
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:07,935
- That he found Harry tomorrow.
- You mean today.

1294
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:10,898
But to Arnie, tomorrow is yesterday.

1295
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:15,172
Let's go get Harry. Come on, Captain.

1296
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:29,931
Here he comes.

1297
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,651
Go on, Arnie.
Run home and tell me about it.

1298
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:52,811
Don't touch him.

1299
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,971
Please, Arnie, run home
and tell your mother.

1300
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:57,131
Beat it, you little creep!

1301
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,370
I mean, hurry home, son.

1302
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:11,770
Captain, you never told me
your first name.

1303
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,931
Albert. What's yours?

1304
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:17,615
Ivy. Albert, let's go.

1305
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:20,055
Just a minute, ma'am.
I want to ask Sam something.

1306
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:24,133
Sam, what did you ask the millionaire
to bring you?

1307
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:32,691
Albert, what was it?

1308
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:36,380
A double bed.
